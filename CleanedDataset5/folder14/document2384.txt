Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

THE INHERITANCE



CHAPTER I The Man in the Field

When the Susquehanna stage came to the daily halt beneath the
blasted pine at the crossroads an elderly man wearing a
flapping frock coat and a soft slouch hat stepped gingerly over
one of the muddy wheels and threw a doubtful glance across the
level tobacco fields where the young plants were drooping in the
June sunshine

So this is my way is it he asked with a jerk of his thumb
toward a cloud of blueandyellow butterflies drifting over a
shining puddlefive miles as the crow flies and through a
bog

For a moment he hung suspended above the encrusted axle peering
with blinking palegray eyes over a pair of goldrimmed
spectacles In his appearance there was the hint of a scholarly
intention unfulfilled and his dress despite its general
carelessness bespoke a different standard of taste from that of
the isolated dwellers in the surrounding fields A casual
observer might have classified him as one of the Virginian
landowners impoverished by the war in reality he was a
successful lawyer in a neighbouring town who amid the overthrow
of the slaveholding gentry some twenty years before had risen
into a provincial prominence

His humour met with a slow response from the driver who sat
playfully flicking at a horsefly on the flank of a tall
rawboned sorrel Wall thars been a sight of rain lately he
observed with goodnatured acquiescence but I dont reckon the
muds moren waist deep an if you do happen to git clean down
thars Sol Peterkin along to pull you out Wharre you hidin
Sol Why bless my boots if he aint gone fast asleep

At this a lean and highfeatured matron encased in the rigidity
of her Sunday bombazine gave a prim poke with her umbrella in
the ribs of a sparrowlike little man with a discoloured
scraggy beard who nodded in one corner of the long seat

Id wake up if I was you she remarked in the voice her sex
assumes when virtue lapses into severity

Starting from his doze the little man straightened his wiry
sunburned neck and mechanically raised his hand to wipe away a
thin stream of tobacco juice which trickled from his halfopen
mouth

Hiwe aint got here aready he exclaimed as he spat
energetically into the mud I dclar if it dont beat allone
minute were thar an the next were here Its a movin world we
live in aint that so mum Then as the severe matron still
stared unbendingly before her he descended between the wheels
and stood nervously scraping his feet in the long grass by the
roadside

This heres Sol Peterkin Mr Carraway said the driver bowing
his introduction as he leaned forward to disentangle the reins
from the sorrels tail an I reckon he kin pint out Blake Hall
to you as well as another seem as he was underoverseer thar
for eighteen years befo the war Now youd better climb in agin
folks its time we were off

He gave an insinuating cluck to the horses while several
passengers who had alighted to gather blackberries from the
ditch scrambled hurriedly into their places With a single
clanking wrench the stage toiled on plodding clumsily over the
miry road

As the spattering muddrops fell round him Carraway lifted his
head and sniffed the air like a pointer that has been just turned
afield For the moment his professional errand escaped him as his
chest expanded in the light wind which blew over the radiant
stillness of the Virginian June From the cloudless sky to its
pure reflection in the rainwashed roads there was barely a
descending shade and the tufts of dandelion blooming against the
rotting rail fence seemed but patches of the clearer sunshine

Bless my soul its like a day out of Scripture he exclaimed
in a tone that was halfapologetic then raising his
walkingstick he leisurely swept it into space Theres hardly
another crop I reckon between here and the Hall

Sol Peterkin was busily cutting a fresh quid of tobacco from the
plug he carried in his pocket and there was a brief pause before
he answered Then as he carefully wiped the blade of his knife
on the leg of his blue jean overalls he looked up with a curious
facial contortion

Oh youll find a corn field or two somewhar along he replied
but its a lanky slipshod kind of crop at best for tobaccys
king down here an no mistake Weve a sayin that the man that
aint partial to the weed cant sleep sound even in the
churchyard an thars some as ill swar to this day that Willie
Moreen never rested in his grave because he didnt chaw an the
soil smelt jest like a plug Oh its a great plant I tell you
suh Look over thar at them fields theyve all been set out
sence the spell o rain

The road they followed crawled like a leisurely river between the
freshly ploughed ridges where the earth was slowly settling
around the transplanted crop In the distance labourers were
still at work passing in dullblue blotches between the rows of
brightgreen leaves that hung limply on their slender stalks

Youve lived at the Hall I hear said Carraway suddenly
turning to look at his companion over his lowered glasses

When it was the Hall suh replied Sol with a tinge of
bitterness in his chuckle Why in my day an that was up to
the very close of the war you might stand at the big gate an
look in any direction you pleased till yo eyes bulged fit to
bust but you couldnt look past the Blake land for all yo
tryin These same fields here were passin through Ive seen
set out in Blake tobaccy time an agin an the farm I live on
three miles beyond the Hall belonged to the old gentleman God
bless him up to the day he died Lord save my soul three
hunnard as likely niggers as you ever clap sight on an that not
countin a good fifty that was too far gone to work

All scattered now I suppose

See them little cabins over yonder With a dirty forefinger he
pointed to the tiny trails of smoke hanging low above the distant
treetops The countys right speckled with em an with thar
childrenall named Blake arter old marster as they called him
or Corbin arter old miss When leetle Mr Christopher got turned
out of the Hall jest befo his pa died an was shuffled into the
house of the overseer whar Bill Fletcher used to live himself
the darkies all bought bits oland here an thar an settled down
to do some farmin on a free scale Stuck up suh Why Zebbadee
Blake passed me yestiddy drivin his own muleteam an I heard
him swar he wouldnt turn out o the road for anybody lessn God
Amighty or Marse Christopher

Aahem exclaimed Carraway with relish and in the meantime
the heir to all this highhanded authority is no better than an
illiterate daylabourer

Peterkin snorted Who Mr Christopher Well he warnt moren
ten years old when his pa went doty an died an I dont reckon
hes had much larnin sence Ive leant on the gate myself an
watched the nigger children traipsin by to the Yankee womans
school an he drivin the plough when he didnt reach much
higher than the handle He used to be the darndest leetle brat
too till his sperits got all freezed out o him Lord Lord
thars such a sight of meanness in this here world that it makes
a body blieve in Providence whether or no

Carraway meditatively twirled his walkingstick Raises tobacco
now like the rest doesnt he

Not like the restbless you no suh Why the weed thrives
under his very touch though he cant abide the smell of it an
thars not a farmer in the county that wouldnt ruther have him
to plant cut or cure than any ten men round about They do say
that his pa went clean crazy about tobaccy jest befo he died
an that Mr Christopher gets dead sick when he smells it smokin
in the barn but he kin pick up a leaf blindfold an tell you the
quality of it at his first touch

For a moment the lawyer was silent pondering a thought he
evidently did not care to utter When at last he spoke it was in
the measured tones of one who overcomes an impediment in his
speech

Do you happen to have heard I wonder anything of his attitude
toward the present owner of the Hall

Happen to have heard Peterkin threw back his head and gasped
Why the whole county has happened to hear of it I reckon Its
been common talk sence the day he got his first birdgun an his
nigger Uncle Boaz found him hidin in the bushes to shoot old
Fletcher when he came in sight I tell you if Bill Fletcher lay
dyin in the road Mr Christopher would sooner ride right over
him than not You ask some folks suh an theyll tell you a
Blake kin hate twice as long as most men kin love

Ah is it so bad as that muttered Carraway

Well he aint much of a Christian as the lights go continued
Sol but I aint sartain accordin to my way of thinkin that
he aint got a better showin on his side than a good many of em
that gits that befo the preacher Hes a Blake skin an bone
anyhow an you aint goin to git this here county to go agin
himnot if he was to turn an spit at Satan himself Old Bill
Fletcher stole his house an his land an his money law or no
lawthats how I look at itbut he couldnt steal his name an
thats what counts among the niggers an the po whites too
Why Ive seen a whole parcel o darkies stand stock still when
Fletcher drove up to the bars with his spankin pair of bays an
then mos break tha necks lettin em down as soon as Mr
Christopher comes along with his team of oxen You kin fool the
quality bout the quality but Ill be blamed if you kin fool the
niggers

Ahead of them there was a scattered group of log cabins
surrounded by little whitewashed palings and at their approach a
decrepit old Negro followed by a slinking blackandtan
foxhound came beneath the straggling hopvine over one of the
doors and through the open gate out into the road His bent old
figure was huddled within his carefully patched clothes of coarse
brown homespun

Howdy marsters he muttered in answer to the lawyers
greeting raising a trembling hand to his wrinkled forehead
Yall ain seen nuttin er ole misss yaller cat Beulah I
reckon

Peterkin who had eyed him with the peculiar disfavour felt for
the black man by the lowborn white evinced a sudden interest
out of all proportion to Carraways conception of the loss

Aint she done come back yet Uncle Boaz he inquired

Naw suh dat she ain en ole miss she ain gwine git a wink er
sleep dis blessed night Me en Spy we is done been traipsin
roun atter dat ar lowlifeted Beulah sence befo de
dinnerbell

When did you miss her first asked Peterkin with concern

I dunno suh dat I dont caze she ain no bettern one er dese
yer wishwishys an I ain mek out yit efn twuz her er her
hant Las night bout sundown dar she wuz alappin her sasser
er milk right at ole miss feet en dis mawnin at sunup dar she
warnt Dats all I know suh efn you lay me out

 Willothewisp


Well I reckon shell turn up agin said Peterkin consolingly
Cats air jest like gals anywaythey aint never happy unless
theyre eternally gallyvantin Why that big white Tom of mine
knows more about this here county than I do myself

Days so suh days de gospel trufe but Ise kinder flustered
bout dat yaller cat caze ole miss sutney do set a heap er sto
by er She ain never let de dawgs come in de oom nohow caze
once she done feel Beulah rar er back at Spy Shes des stone
blin is ole miss but I dclar she kin smell powful keen an
taro no use tryin ter fool her wid one houn er de hull pack
Lawd Lawd I wunner ef dat ar cat kin be layin close over
yonder at Sis Daphnes

He branched off into a little path which ran like a white thread
across the field grumbling querulously to the blackandtan
foxhound that ambled at his heels

Dars a wallopin ahaid er you shos you bon he muttered as
he limped on toward a small log hut from which floated an
inviting fragrance of bacon frying in fat I reckon you lay dat
you kin cut yo mulatter capers wid me all you please but youd
better look out sharp fo you begin foolin long er Marse
Christopher Dar you go agin now Ain dat des like you Wat you
wanter go sickin atter dat ole hyar fer anyhow

So that is one of young Blakes hangerson observed Carraway
with a slight inflection of inquiry

Uncle Boaz you mean Oh he was the old gentlemans
bodyservant befo the war He used to wear his marsters
castoff ruffles an high hat A mighty likely nigger he was
too
till he got all bent up with the rheumatics

The lawyer had lifted his walkingstick and was pointing straight
ahead to a group of old brick chimneys huddled in the sunset
above a grove of giant oaks

That must be Blake Hall over there he said theres not
another house like it in the three counties

Well be at the big gate in a minute suh Peterkin returned
This is the first view of the Hall you git an they say the old
gentleman used to raise his hat whenever he passed by it Then
as they swung open the great iron gate with its new coat of red
he touched Carraways sleeve and spoke in a hoarse whisper
Thars Mr Christopher himself over yonder he said an Lord
bless my soul if he aint settin out old Fletchers plants
Thar hes standin up nowthe big young fellow with the basket
The old gentleman was the biggest man twixt here an
Fredericksburg but I dclar Mr Christopher is a good halfhead
taller

At his words Carraway stopped short in the road raising his
useless glasses upon his brow The sun had just gone down in a
blaze of light and the great bare field was slowly darkening
against the west

Nearer at hand there were the long road already in twilight the
rail fence wrapped in creepers and a solitary chestnut tree in
full bloom Farther away swept the freshly ploughed ground over
which passed the moving figures of the labourers transplanting
the young crop Of them all Carraway saw but a single workerin
reality only one among the daily toilers in the field moulded
physically perhaps in a finer shape than they and limned in the
lawyers mental vision against a century of the brilliant if
tragic history of his race As he moved slowly along between the
even rows dropping from time to time a plant into one of the
small holes dug before him and pausing with the basket on his
arm to settle the earth carefully with his foot he seemed
indeed as much the product of the soil upon which he stood as
did the great white chestnut growing beside the road In his
pose in his walk in the careless carriage of his head there
was something of the large freedom of the elements

A dangerous young giant observed the lawyer slowly letting
his glasses fall before his eyes A monumental Blake as it
were Well as I have remarked before upon occasions blood will
tell even at the dregs

Hes the very spit of his pa thats so replied Peterkin an
though its no business of mine Im afeared hes got the old
gentlemans dry throat along with it Lord Lord Ive always
stood it out that its better to water yo mouth with tobaccy
than to burn it up with sperits He checked himself and fell
back hastily for young Blake after a single glance at the west
had tossed his basket carelessly aside and was striding
vigorously across the field

Not another plant will I set out and thats an end of it he
was saying angrily I agreed to do a days work and Ive been at
it steadily since sunrise Is it any concern of mine Id like to
know if he cant put in his crop tonight Do you think I care
whether his tobacco rots in the ground or out of it

As he came on Carraway measured him coolly with an appreciation
tempered by his native sense of humour He perceived at once a
certain coarseness of finish which despite the deeprooted
veneration for an idle ancestry is found most often in the
descendants of a long line of generous livers A moment later he
weighed the keen gray flash of the eyes beneath the thick fair
hair the coating of dust and sweat over the highbred curve from
brow to nose and the fullness of the jaw which bore with a
suggestion of sheer brutality upon the general impression of a
fine racial type Taken from the mouth up the face might have
passed as a pure fleshly copy of the antique idea seen
downward it became almost repelling in its massive power

Stooping beside the fence for a common harvest hat the young man
placed it on his head and gave a careless nod to Peterkin He
had thrown one leg over the rails and was about to swing himself
into the road when Sol spoke a little timidly

I hear yo mas done lost her yaller cat Mr Christopher

For an instant Christopher hung midway of the fence

Isnt the beast back yet he asked irritably scraping the mud
from his boot upon the rail Ive had Uncle Boaz scouring the
county half the day

A pack of hounds that had been sleeping under the sassafras
bushes across the road came fawning to his feet and he pushed
them impatiently aside

I was thinkin began Peterkin with an uncertain cough that
I might manage to send over my big white Tom an bein blind
maybe she wouldnt know the difference

Christopher shook his head

Oh its no use he replied speaking with an air of
superiority She could pick out that cat among a million I
believe with a single touch Well theres no help for it Down
Spotdown I say Sir

With a leisurely movement he swung himself from the fence
stopping to wipe his brow with his blue cotton sleeve Then he
went whistling defiantly down the way to the Hall turning at
last into a sunken road that trailed by an abandoned icepond
where bullfrogs were croaking hoarsely in the rushes



CHAPTER II The Owner of Blake Hall

As they followed the descending road between flowering chestnuts
Blake Hall rose gradually into fuller view its great oaks
browned by the approaching twilight and the fading afterglow
reflected in a single visible pane Seen close at hand the house
presented a cheerful spaciousness of fronta surety of light and
airproduced in part by the clean white Doric columns of the
portico and in part by the ample slope of shaven lawn studded
with reds of brightly blooming flowers From the smoking chimneys
presiding over the ancient roof to the hospitable steps leading
from the boxbordered walk below the outward form of the
dwelling spoke to the imaginative mind of that inner spirit which
had moulded it into a lasting expression of a racial sentiment
as if the Virginia creeper covering the old brick walls had
wreathed them in memories as tenacious as itself

For more than two hundred years Blake Hall had stood as the one
great house in the countya manifestation in brick and mortar of
the hereditary greatness of the Blakes To Carraway impersonal
as his interest was the acknowledgment brought a sudden vague
resentment and for an instant he bit his lip and hung
irresolute as if more than halfinclined to retrace his steps A
slight thing decided himthe gaiety of a boys laugh that
floated from one of the lower rooms and swinging his stick
briskly to add weight to his determination he ascended the broad
steps and lifted the old brass knocker A moment later the door
was opened by a large mulatto woman in a soiled apron who took
his small handbag from him and when he asked for Mr Fletcher
led him across the great hall into the unused drawingroom

The shutters were closed and as she flung them back on their
rusty hinges the pale June twilight entered with the breath of
mycrophylla roses In the scented dusk Carraway stared about the
desolate crudely furnished room which gave back to his troubled
fancy the face of a pitiable dishonoured corpse The soul of it
was gone foreverthat peculiar spirit of place which makes every
old house the guardian of an inner lifethe keeper of a familys
ghost What remained was but the outer husk the disfigured
frame upon which the newer imprint seemed only a passing insult

On the high wainscoted walls he could still trace the vacant
dustmarked squares where the Blake portraits had once
hunglines that the successive scrubbings of fifteen years had
not utterly effaced A massive mahogany sofa carved to represent
a horn of plenty had been purchased perhaps at a general sale
of the old furniture with several quaint rosewood chairs and a
rare cabinet of inlaid woods For the rest the later additions
were uniformly cheap and illchosena blue plush set bought
possibly at a village store a walnut table with a sallow marble
top and several hard engravings of historic subjects

When the lawyer turned from a curious inspection of these works
of art he saw that only a curtain of flimsy chintz stretched
between a pair of fluted columns separated him from the
adjoining room where a lamp with lowered wick was burning
under a bright red shade After a moments hesitation he drew the
curtain aside and entered what he took at once to be the common
livingroom of the Fletcher family

Here the effect was less depressing though equally
uninterestinga paper novel or two on the big Bible upon the
table combined indeed with a costly piano in one corner to
strike a note that was entirely modern The white crocheted
tidies on the chairbacks elaborated with endless patience out
of innumerable spools of darning cotton lent a feminine touch to
the furniture which for an instant distracted Carraways mental
vision from the impending personality of Fletcher himself He
remembered now that there was a sister whom he had heard vaguely
described by the women of his family as quite too hopeless and
a granddaughter of whom he knew merely that she had for years
attended an expensive school somewhere in the North The grandson
he recalled after a moment more distinctly as a pretty
undeveloped boy in white pinafores who had once accompanied
Fletcher upon a hurried visit to the town The gay laugh had
awakened the incident in his mind and he saw again the little
cleanly clad figure perched upon his desk nibbling bakers buns
while he transacted a tedious piece of business with the vulgar
grandfather

He was toying impatiently with these recollections when his
attention was momentarily attracted by the sound of Fletchers
burly tones on the rear porch just beyond the open window

I tell you youve set all the niggers agin me and I cant get
hands to work the crops

Thats your lookout of course replied a voice which he
associated at once with young Blake I told you Id work three
days because I wanted the ready money Ive got it and my time
is my own again

But I say my tobaccos got to get into the ground this
weekits too big for the plantbed aready and with three days
of this sun the earthll be dried as hard as a rock

Theres no doubt of it I think

And its all your blamed fault burst out the other angrily
youve gone and turned them all agin mewhite and black alike
Why its as much as I can do to get a stroke of honest labour in
this niggerridden country

Christopher laughed shortly

There is no use blaming the Negroes he said and his
pronunciation of the single word would have stamped him in
Virginia as of a different class from Fletcher theyre usually
ready enough to work if you treat them decently

Treat them began Fletcher and Carraway was about to fling
open the shutters when light steps passed quickly along the hall
and he heard the rustle of a womans silk dress against the
wainscoting

Theres a stranger to see you grandfather called a girls
even voice from the house finish paying off the hands and come
in at once

Well of all the impudence exclaimed the young man with a
saving dash of humour Then without so much as a parting word
he ran quickly down the steps and started rapidly in the
direction of the darkening road while the silk dress rustled
upon the porch and at the garden gate as the latch was lifted

Go in grandfather called the girls voice from the garden to
which Fletcher responded as decisively

For Heavens sake let me manage my own affairs Maria You seem
to have inherited your poor mothers pesky habit of meddling

Well I told you a gentleman was waiting returned the girl
stubbornly You didnt let us know he was coming either and
Lindy says there isnt a thing fit to eat for supper

Fletcher snorted and then before entering the house stopped to
haggle with an old Negro woman for a pair of spring chickens
hanging dejectedly from her outstretched hand their feet tied
together with a strip of faded calico

How much you gwine gimme fer dese marster she inquired
anxiously deftly twirling them about until they swung with heads
aloft

Rising to the hucksters instinct Fletcher poked the offerings
suspiciously beneath their flapping wings

Thirty cents for the pairnot a copper more he responded
promptly theyre as poor as Jobs turkey both of em

Lawdy marster you know bettern dat

Theyre skin and bones I tell you feel em yourself Well
take it or leave it thirty cents is all Ill give

Shut up confound you cut in Fletcher sharply

If you dont stop your chatter Ill set the dogs on you Shut
up I say

He strode into the house slamming the heavy door behind him and
a moment afterward Carraway heard him scolding brutally at the
servants across the hall

The old Negress had gone muttering from the porch with her unsold
chickens when the door softly opened again and the girl who
had entered through the front with her basket of flowers came
out into the growing moonlight

Wait a moment Aunt Mehitable she said I want to speak to
you

Aunt Mehitable turned slowly putting a feeble hand to her dazed
eyes You ain ole miss come back agin is you honey she
questioned doubtfully

I dont know who your old miss was replied the girl but I am
not she whoever she may have been I am Maria Fletcher You
dont remember meyet you used to bake me ashcakes when I was a
little girl

The old woman shook her head You ain Marse Fletchers chile

His granddaughterbut I must go in to supper Here is the money
for your chickensgrandpa was only joking you know he loves to
joke Take the chickens to the henhouse and get something hot to
eat in the kitchen before you start out again

She ran hurriedly up the steps and entered the hall just as
Fletcher was shaking hands with his guest



CHAPTER III Showing that a Little Culture Entails Great Care

Carraway had risen to meet his host in a flutter that was almost
one of dread In the eight years since their last interview it
seemed to him that his mental image of his great client had
magnified in proportionsthat Fletcher had outFletchered
himself as he felt inclined to put it The old betrayal of his
employers dependence which at first had been merely a suspicion
in the lawyers mind had begun gradually as time went on to
bristle with the points of significant details In looking back
halfhinted things became clear to him at last and he gathered
bit by bit the whole clever hopeless villainy of the
schemethe crime hedged about by law with all the prating
protection of a virtue He knew now that Fletcherthe old
overseer of the Blake slaveshad defrauded the innocent as
surely as if he had plunged his great red fist into the little
pocket of a child had defrauded indeed with so strong a blow
that the very consciousness of his victim had been stunned There
had been about his act all the damning hypocrisy of a great
theftall the air of stern morality which makes for the popular
triumph of the heroic swindler

These things Carraway understood yet as the man strode into the
room with open palm and a general air of bluff hospitalityas if
he had just been blown by some fresh strong wind across his
tobacco fieldsthe lawyer experienced a relief so great that the
breath he drew seemed a fit measure of his earlier foreboding
For Fletcher outwardly was but the common type of farmer after
all with a trifle more intelligence perhaps than is met with
in the average Southerner of his class A plain man but honest
sir was what one expected him to utter at every turn It was
written in the coarse open lines of his face halfhidden by a
bushy gray beard in his small sparkling eyes now blue now
brown in his looselimbed shambling movements as he crossed the
room His very clothes spoke to an acute observer of a
masculine sincerity naked and unashamedas if his large
coffeespotted cravat would not alter the smallest fold to
conceal the stains it bore Hale hairy vehement not without a
quality of Rabelaisian humour he appeared the last of all men
with whom one would associate the burden of a troubled
conscience

Sorry to have kept youon my word I am he began heartily
but to tell the truth I thought thard be somebody in the house
with sense enough to show you to a bedroom Like to run up now
for a wash before supper

It was what one expected of him such a speech blurted in so
offhand a manner and the lawyer could barely suppress a
threatening laugh

Oh it was a short trip he returned and a walk of five miles
on a day like this is one of the most delightful things in life
Ive been looking out at your garden by the way andI may as
well confess itoverhearing a little of your conversation

Is that so chuckled Fletcher his great eyebrows overhanging
his eyes like a mustache grown out of place Well you didnt
hear anything to tickle your ears I reckon Ive been having a
row with that cantankerous fool Blake The queer thing about
these people is that they seem to think Im to blame every time
they see a spot on their tablecloths Mark my words it aint
been two years since I found that nigger Boaz digging in my
asparagus bed and he told me he was looking for some shoots for
ole misss dinner

The property idea is very strong in these rural counties you
see remarked the lawyer gravely They feel that every year
adds a value to the hereditary possession of land and that when
an estate has borne a single name for a century there has been a
veritable impress placed upon it Your asparagus bed is merely an
item you find I fancy other instances

Fletcher turned in his chair

Thats the whole blamed rotten truth he admitted waving his
great red hand toward the door but lets have supper first and
settle down to talk on a full stomach Thars no hurry with all
night before us and that to come to facts is why I sent for
you No lawyers office for me when I want to talk business but
an easychair by my own table and a cup of coffee beforehand

As he finished a bell jangled in the hall and the door opened
to admit the girl whom Carraway had seen a little earlier upon
the porch

Suppers a good hour late Maria grumbled Fletcher looking at
his heavy silver watch and I smelt the bacon frying at six
oclock

For an instant the girl looked as if she had more than half an
intention to slap his face then quickly recovering her
selfpossession she smiled at Carraway and held out a small
white hand with an air of quiet elegance which was the most
noticeable thing in her appearance

I am quite a stranger to you Mr Carraway she said with a
laugh but if you had only known it I had a doll named after
you when I was very small Guy Carrawayit seemed to me all
that was needed to make a fairy tale

The lawyer joined in her laugh which never rose above a
carefully modulated minor I confess that I once took the same
view of it my dear young lady he returned so I ended by
dropping the name and keeping only the initial Your grandfather
will tell you that I am now G Carraway and nothing more I
couldnt afford as things were to make a fairy tale of my life
you see

Oh if one only could said the girl lowering her full dark
eyes which gave a piteous lie to her sullen mouth

She was artificial Carraway told himself with emphasis and yet
the distinction of mannerthe elegancewas certainly the point
at which her training had not failed He felt it in her tall
straight figure absurdly overdressed for a granddaughter of
Fletchers in her smooth white hands with their finely polished
nails in her pale repressed face which he called plain while
admitting that it might become interesting in her shapely head
even with its heavy cable of coalblack hair

What she was her education had made of herthe look of serene
distinction the repose of her thinfeatured colourless face
refined beyond the point of prettinessthese things her training
had given her and these were the things which Carraway with his
oldfashioned loyalty to a strong class prejudice found himself
almost resenting Bill Fletchers granddaughter had he felt no
right to this rare security of breeding which revealed itself in
every graceful fold of the dress she wore for with Fletcher an
honest man she would have been perhaps but one of the sallow
overdriven drudges who stare like helpless effigies from the
little tumbledown cabins along country roadsides

Fletcher meanwhile had filled in the pause with one of his
sudden burly dashes into speech

Maria has been so long at her highandmighty boardingschool
he said that I reckon her heads as full of fancies as a cheese
is of maggots Shes even got a notion that she wants to turn out
all this new stuffto haul the old rubbish back again but I say
wait till the boy comes onthen well see well see

And in the meantime well go in to supper put in the girl with
a kind of hopeless patience though Carraway could see that she
smarted as from a blow This is Will Mr Carraway she added
almost gaily skillfully sweeping her train from about the feet
of
a pretty undersized boy of fourteen years who had burst into
the room with his mouth full of bread and jam Hes quite the
pride of the family you know because hes just taken all the
honours of his school

History rithmatic Latinall the languages rolled out
Fletcher in a voice that sounded like a tattoo I cant keep up
with em but theyre all thar aint they sonny

Oh you could never say em off straight grandpa retorted the
boy with the pertness of a spoiled girl at which to Carraways
surprise Fletcher fairly chuckled with delight

Thats so Im a plain man the Lord knows he admitted his
coarse face crinkling like a sundried leaf of tobacco

Weve got chickens for supperbroiled the boy chattered on
putting out his tongue at his sister thats why Lindys havin
it an hour late shes been picking em with Aunt Mehitable
helping her for the feathers Now dont shake your head at me
Maria because its no use pretending we have em every night
like old Mrs Blake

Bless my soul gasped Fletcher nettled by the last remark Do
you mean to tell me those Blakes are fools enough to eat spring
chicken when they could get forty cents apiece for em in the
open market

The old lady does corrected the boy glibly The one who wears
the queer lace cap and sits in the big chair by the hearth all
dayand all night too Tommy Spade says cause he peeped
through once at midnight and she was still there sitting so
stiff that it scared him and he ran away Well Aunt Mehitable
sold her a dozen and she got a side of bacon and a bag of meal

Grandfather youve forgotten Aunt Saidie broke in Maria as
Fletcher was about to begin his grace without waiting for a dumpy
little woman in purple calico who waddled with an embarrassed
air from her hasty preparations in the pantry At first Carraway
had mistaken her for an upper servant but as she came forward
Maria laid her hand playfully upon her arm and introduced her
with a sad little gaiety of manner I believe she has met one of
your sisters in Fredericksburg she added after a moment
Clearly she had determined to accept the family in the lump with
a resolution thathad it borne less resemblance to a passive
rage could not have failed to glorify a nobler martyrdom It was
not affection that fortified herbeyond her first gently
tolerant glance at the boy there had been only indifference in
her pale composed faceand the lawyer was at last brought to
the surprising conclusion that Fletchers granddaughter was
seeking to build herself a fetish of the mere idle bond of blood
The hopeless gallantry of the girl moved him to a vague feeling
of pity and he spoke presently with a chivalrous desire of
making her failure easy

It was Susan I think he said pleasantly shaking hands with
the squat little figure in front of him I remember her speaking
of it afterward

I met her at a church festival one Christmas Eve responded
Aunt Saidie in a highpitched rasping voice The same evening
that I got this pink crocheted nuby She touched a small pointed
shawl about her shoulders Miss Belinda Beale worked it and it
was raffled off for ten cents a chance

Her large plump face overflushed about the nose had a natural
kindliness of expression which Carraway found almost appealing
and he concluded that as a girl she might have possessed a common
prettiness of feature Above her clear blue eyes a widening
parting divided her tightly crimped bands of hair which still
showed a bright chestnut tint in the gray ripples

Thar thar Saidie Fletcher interrupted with a frank
brutality which the lawyer found more repelling than the memory
of his stolen fortune Mr Carraway doesnt want to hear about
your fascinator Hed a long ways rather have you make his
coffee

The little woman flushed purple and drew back her chair with an
ugly noise from the head of the lavishly spread table

Set down right thar suh she stammered her poor little
pretense of ease gone from her right thar between Brother Bill
and me

You did say it Aunt Saidie I told you you would screamed the
pert boy beginning an assault upon an enormous dish of
batterbread

Maria flinched visibly Be silent Will she ordered
Grandfather you must really make Will learn to be polite

Now now Maria youre too hard on us protested Fletcher
flinging himself bodily into the breach boys will be boys you
knowthey warnt born gals

But she did say it Maria insisted the boy and she bet me a
whole dish of doughnuts she wouldnt She did say set I heard
her Maria bit her lip and her flashing eyes filled with angry
tears while Carraway as he began talking hurriedly about the
promise of tobacco resisted valiantly an impulse to kick the
pretty boy beneath the table As his eyes traveled about the
fine old room marking its mellow wainscoting and the whitened
silver handles on the heavy doors he found himself wondering
with implacable approval if this might not be the beginning of a
great atonement

The boys mood had varied at the sight of his sisters tears and
he fell to patting penitently the hand that quivered on the
table You neednt give me the doughnuts Aunt Saidie Ill make
believe you didnt say it he whispered at last

Do you take sugar Mr Carraway asked Miss Saidie flushed and
tremulous at the head of the overcrowded table with its massive
modern silver service Poor little woman thought the lawyer
with his first positive feeling of sympathy she would have been
happier frying her own bacon amid bouncing children in a
labourers cabin He leaned toward her speaking with a grave
courtesy which she met with the frightened questioning eyes of
a child She was quite too hopeless he reluctantly admitted
yet despite himself he felt a sudden stir of honest human
tendernessthe tenderness he had certainly not felt for
Fletcher nor for the pretty pert boy nor even for the elegant
Maria herself

I was looking out at the dear old garden awhile ago he said
and I gathered from it that you must be fond of flowerssince
your niece tells me she has been away so long

She brightened into animation her broad capable hands fumbling
with the big greenandgold teacups

Yes I raise em she answered Did you happen to notice the
bed of heartsease I worked every inch of that myself last
springand now Im planting zinnias and touchmenots and
sweetwilliams theyll all come along later

And princesfeather added the lawyer reminiscently that
used to be a favourite of mine I remember when I was a country
lad

Ive got a whole border of em out at the back large fine
plants toobut Maria wants to root em up She says theyre
vulgar because they grow in all the niggers yards

Vulgar So this was the measure of Maria Carraway told
himself as he fell into his pleasant ridicule Why if God
Almighty ever created a vulgar flower my dear young lady I have
yet to see it

But dont you think it just a little gaudy for a lawn
suggested the girl easily stung to the defensive

It looks cheerful and I like it insisted Aunt Saidie
emboldened by a rare feeling of support Ma used to have two big
green tubs of it on either side the front door when we were
children and we used to stick it in our hats and play we was
real fine folks Dont you recollect it Brother Bill

Good Lord Saidie the things you do recollect exclaimed
Fletcher who beneath the agonised eyes of Maria was drinking
his coffee from his saucer in great spluttering gulps

The girl was in absolute torture this Carraway saw in the white
strained nervous intensity of her look yet the knowledge served
only to irritate him so futile appeared any attempt to soften
the effect of Fletchers grossness Before the mans colossal
vulgarity of soul mere brutishness of manner seemed but a
trifling phase



CHAPTER IV Of Human Nature in the Raw State

When at last the pickles and preserved watermelon rind had been
presented with a finishing flourish and Carraway had
successfully resisted Miss Saidies final passionate insistence
in the matter of the big blackberry roll before her Fletcher
noisily pushed back his chair and with a careless jerk of his
thumb in the direction of his guest stamped across the hall into
the family sittingroom

Now well make ourselves easy and fall to threshing things out
he remarked filling a blackened brierroot pipe into the bowl
of which he packed the tobacco with his stubby forefinger Yes
Im a lover of the weed you seedont you smoke or chaw suh

Carraway shook his head When I was young and wanted to I
couldnt he explained and now that I am old and can I have
unfortunately ceased to want to Ive passed the time of life
when a man begins a habit merely for the sake of its being a
habit

Well I reckon youre wise as things go though for my part I
believe I took to the weed before I did to my mothers breast I
cut my first tooth on a plug she used to say

He threw himself into a capacious cretonnecovered chair and
kicking his carpet slippers from him sat swinging one massive
foot in its gray yarn sock Through the thickening smoke Carraway
watched the complacency settle over his great hairy face

And now to begin with the beginning what do you think of my
grandchildren he demanded abruptly taking his pipe from his
mouth after a long sucking breath and leaning forward with his
elbow on the arm of his chair

The other hesitated Youve done well by them I should say

A fine pair eh

The admission is easy

Look at the gal now burst out Fletcher impulsively Would
you fancy to see her stepping by that her grandfather used to
crack the whip over a lot of dirty niggers He drove the fact in
squarely with big sure blows of his fist surveying it with an
enthusiasm the other found amazing Would you fancy even he
continued after a moment that her father warnt as good as I
amthat he left overseeing to jine the army and came out to
turn blacksmith if I hadnt kept him till he drank himself to
death His wife Why the woman couldnt read her own name unless
you printed it in letters as long as your fingerand now jest
turn and look at Maria he wound up in a puff of smoke

The girls wonderful admitted Carraway Shes like a
dressedup dollbaby too all the natural thing has been
squeezed out of her and shes stuffed with sawdust

Its a pity she aint a little better looking in the face
pursued Fletcher waving the criticism aside Shes a plagued
sight too pale and squinchedup for my tastefor all her fine
air I like em red and juicy and though you wont believe me
most likely she cant hold a tallow candle to what Saidie was
when she was young But then Saidie never had her chance and
Marias had em doubled over Why she left home as soon as shed
done sucking and she hasnt spent a single summer here since she
was eight years old Small thanks Ill get for it I reckon but
Ive done a fair turn by Maria

The boy comes next I suppose Carraway broke in watching the
others face broaden into a big purple smile

Ah thar youre rightits the boy Ive got my eye on now His
names the same as mine you know and I reckon one day William
Fletcherll make his mark among the quality Hell have it all
toothe house the land everything except a share of the money
which goes to the gal Itll make her childbearing easier I
reckon and for my part thats the only thing a womans fit for
Dont talk to me about a childless woman Why Id as soon keep a
cow that wouldnt calve

You were speaking of the boy I believe coolly interrupted
Carraway To a man of his oldfashioned chivalric ideal the
brutal allusion to the girl was like a deliberate blow in the
face

So I wasso I was Well hes to have it all I sayevery
mite and welcome Ive had a pretty tough life in my timeyou
can tell it from my hands suhbut I aint begrudging it if it
leaves the boy a bit better off Lord thars many and many a
nightwhen I was little and my stepfather kicked me out of doors
without a bite that I used to steal into somebody or others
cowshed and snuggle for warmth into the strawyes and suck the
udders of the cows for food too Oh Ive had a hard enough
life for all the way it looks nowand Im not saying that if
the choice was mine Id go over it agin even as it stands today
Were set here for better or for worse thats my way of
thinking and if thars any harm comes of it Providence has got
to take a share of the blame

Hardly the preachers view of the matter is it

Maybe not and I aint got a quarrel with em the Lord knows I
go to church like clockwork and pay my pewrent too which is
more than some do that gabble the most about salvation If I pay
for the preachers keep its only fair that I should get some of
the good that comes to him hereafter thats how it looks to me
so I dont trouble my head much about the ins and the outs of
getting saved or damned Ive never puled in this world thank
God and let come what will I aint going to begin puling in the
next But to go back to whar I started from it all makes in the
end for that pretty little chap over yonder in the diningroom
Rather puny for his years now but as sound as a nut and hell
grow hell grow When his motherpoor worthless drabgave
birth to him and died I told her it was the best days work
shed ever done

Carraways humour rippled over Its easy to imagine what her
answer must have been to such a pleasantry he observed

Oh she was a fool that womana born fool

Her answer was that it would be the best day for her only when I
came to call it the worst She hated me a long sight more than
she hated the devil and if she was to rise out of her grave
today shed probably start right in scrubbing for those darned
Blakes

Ah said Carraway

Its the plain truth but I dont visit it on the little lad
Why should I Hes got my nameI saw to thatand mark my word
hell grow up yet to marry among the quality

The secret was out at lastFletchers purpose was disclosed and
even in the strong light of his past misdeeds it showed not
without a hint of pathos The very renouncement of any personal
ambition served to invest the racial one with a kind of grandeur

Theres evidently an enviable career before him said the
lawyer at the end of a long pause and this brings me by the
way to the question I wish to ashad your desire to see me any
connection with the prospects of your grandson

In a way yes though to tell the truth it has more to do with
that young Blakes Hes been bothering me a good deal of late
and I mean to have it square with him before Bill Fletchers a
year older

No difficulty about your title to the estate I presume

Oh Lord no thats all fair and square suh I bought the
place you know when it went at auction jest a few years after
the war I bought and paid for it right down and that settled
things for good and all

Carraway considered the fact for a moment If I remember
correctlyI mean unless gossip went very far afieldthe place
brought exactly seven thousand dollars His gaze plunged into
the moonlight beyond the open window and followed the clear sweep
of the distant fields Seven thousand dollars he added softly
and theres not a finer in Virginia

Thar was nobody to bid agin me you see explained Fletcher
easily The old gentleman was as poor as Jobs turkey then
besides going doty mighty fast

The common report was I believe pursued the lawyer that the
old man himself did not know of the place being for sale until he
heard the auctioneers hammer on the lawn and that his mind left
him from the momentthis was of course mere idle talk

Oh youll hear anything snorted Fletcher The old gentleman
hadnt a red copper to his name and if he couldnt pay the
mortgages how under heaven could he have bought in the place As
a plain man I put the question

But his friends Where were his friends I wonder In his youth
he was one of the most popular men in the Statea high liver and
good toaster you rememberand later on he stood well in the
Confederate Government That he should have fallen into abject
poverty seems really incomprehensible

Fletcher twisted in his chair Why that was jest three years
after the war I tell you he said with irritable emphasis he
hadnt a friend this side of Jordan I reckon who could have
raised fifty cents to save his soul The quality were as bad off
as thar own niggers

Truetrue admitted Carraway but the surprising thing isI
dont hesitate to saythat you who had been overseer to the
Blakes for twenty years should have been able in those destitute
times and on the spot as it were to put down seven thousand
dollars

He faced the fact unflinchingly dragging it from the long
obscurity full into the red glare of the lamplight Here was the
main thing he knew in Fletchers historyhere was the supreme
offense For twenty years the man had been the trusted servant of
his feeble employer and when the final crash came he had risen
with full hands from the wreck The prodigal Blakesburning the
candle at both ends people saidhad squandered a double fortune
before the war and in an equally stupendous fashion Fletcher had
amassed one

Oh tharre ways and ways of putting by a penny he now
protested and I turned over a bit during the war I may as well
own up though folks had only black looks for speculators then

We used to call them bloodsuckers I remember

Well thats neither here nor thar suh When the place went for
seven thousand I paid it down and Ive managed one way and
anotherand in spite of the pesky niggersto make a pretty bit
out of the tobacco crop hard as times have been The Hall is
mine now thars no going agin that and so help me God itll
belong to a William Fletcher long after I am dead

Ah that brings us directly to the point

Fletcher squared himself about in his chair while his pipe went
out slowly

The point if youll have it straight he said is jest
thisI want the whole placeevery inch of itand Ill die or
git it as sures my names my own Thars still that old frame
house and the piece of land tacked to it whar the overseers used
to live cutting straight into the heart of my tobacco fieldsin
clear view of the Hall tooright in the middle of my land I
tell you

Oh I seeI see muttered Carraway thats the little farm in
the midst of the estate which the old gentlemanbless his weak
head and strong heart gave his wifes brother Colonel Corbin
who came back crippled from the war Yes I remember now there
was a joke at the time about his saying that land was the
cheapest present he could give

It was all his besotted foolishness you know to think of a sane
man deeding away seventy acres right in the heart of his tract of
two thousand He meant it for a joke of course Mr Tucker or
Colonel Corbin if you choose was like one of the family but he
was as sensitive as a kid about his wounds and he wanted to live
off somewhar shut up by himself Well hes got enough folks
about him now the Lord knows Thars the old lady and the two
gals and Mr Christopher to say nothing of Uncle Boaz and a
whole troop of worthless niggers that are eating him out of house
and home Tom Spade has a deed of trust on the place for three
hundred dollars he told me so himself

So I understand and all this is a serious inconvenience to you
I may suppose

Inconvenience Blood and thunder It takes the heart right out
of my land I tell you Why the very road I cut to save myself
half a mile of mudholes came to a dead stop because Mr
Christopher wouldnt let it cross his blamed pasture

Carraway thoughtfully regarded his finger nails Then bless my
soulseeing its your private affairwhat are you going to do
about it he inquired

Git it The devil knows howI dont but git it I will I
brought you down here to talk those fools over and I mean you to
do it Its all spite pure rotten spite thats what it is
Look here Ill gladly give em three thousand dollars for that
strip of land and it wouldnt bring nine hundred on my oath

Have you made the offer

Made it Why if I set foot on the tip edge of that land Id
have every lean hound in the pack snapping at my heels As for
that young rascal hed knock me down if I so much as scented the
matter

He rapped his pipe sharply on the wood of his chair and a little
pile of ashes settled upon the floor With a laugh the other
waved his hand in protest

So you prefer to make the proposition by proxy My dear sirIm
not a rubber ball

Oh he wont hurt you It would spoil the sport to punch
anybodys head but mine you know Come now isnt it a fair
offer Im making

It appears so certainlyand I really do not see why he should
wish to hold the place It isnt worth much I fancy to anybody
but the owner of the Hall and with the three thousand clear he
could probably get a much better one at a little distancewith
the additional value of putting a few square miles between
himself and youwhom I may presume he doesnt love

Oh you may presume he hates me if youll only work it snorted
Fletcher Go over thar boldlyno slinking mind youtomorrow
morning and talk them into reason Lord man you ought to be
able to do itdont you know Greek

Carraway nodded Not that it ever availed me much in an
argument he confessed frankly

Its a good thing to stop a mouth with anyway Thars many and
many a time I tell you Ive lost a bargain for the lack of a
few rags of Latin or Greek Drag it in stuff it down em gag
thar mouthsits better than all the swearing under heaven Why
taking the Lords name in vain aint nothing to a line of poetry
spurted of a sudden in one of them deadandgone languages Its
been done at me suh and I know how it worksthats why Ive
put the boy upstairs on em from the start Taint much matter
whether he goes far in his own tongue or not thats what I said
but dose him well with something his neighbours havent learnt

He rose with a lurch laid his pipe on the mantel and drew out
his big silver watch

Great Jehosaphat its eleven and after he exclaimed Well
its time for us to turn in I reckon and dream of breakfast If
youll hold the lamp while I bolt up Ill show you to your
room

Carraway picked up the lamp and cautiously following his host
into the darkened hall waited until he had fastened the
nightchains and shot the heavy bolts

If you want a drink of water thars a bucket in the porch said
Fletcher as he opened the back door and reached out into the
moonlight Wait thar a second and Ill hand you the dipper

He stepped out upon the porch and a moment later Carraway heard
a heavy stumble followed by a muttered oath

Why blast the varmints Ive upset the boys cage of white mice
and theyre skedaddling about my legs Here hold the lamp will
youIm squashing a couple of em under each of my hands

Carraway leaning out with the lamp which drew a brilliant
circle on the porch saw Fletcher floundering helplessly upon his
hands and knees in the midst of the fleeing family of mice

Theyre a plagued mess of beasts thats what they are he
exclaimed but the little lad sets a heap of store by em and
when he comes down tomorrow hell find that I got some of em
back anyway

He fastened the cage and placed it carefully beneath the bench
Then closing and bolting the door he took the lamp from
Carraway and motioned him up the dusky staircase to the spare
chamber at the top



CHAPTER V The Wreck of the Blakes

When Christopher left Blake Hall he swung vigorously in the
twilight across the newly ploughed fields until at the end of a
few minutes walk he reached the sunken road that branched off
by the abandoned icepond Here the bullfrogs were still croaking
hoarsely and far away over the graygreen rushes a dim moon was
mounting the steep slope of bluish sky

The air was fresh with the scent of the upturned earth and the
closing day refined into a tranquil beauty but the young man as
he passed briskly did not so much as draw a lengthened breath
and when presently the cry of a whippoorwill floated from the
old rail fence he fell into a whistling mockery of the plaintive
notes The dogs at his heels started a rabbit once from the close
cover of the underbrush and he called them to order in a sharp
peremptory tone Not until he reached the long whitewashed gate
opening before the frame house of the former overseers did he
break the easy swing of his accustomed stride

The house a common country dwelling of the sort used by the
poorer class of farmers lost something of its angularity beneath
the moonlight and even the halfdried garments spread after the
days washing on the bent old rosebushes shone in soft white
patches amid the grass which looked thick and fine under the
heavy dew In one corner of the yard there was a spreading
peachtree on which the shriveled little peaches ripened out of
season and against the narrow porch sprawled a gray and crippled
aspen where a flock of turkeys had settled to roost along its
twisted boughs

In one of the lower rooms a lamp was burning and as Christopher
crunched heavily along the pebbled path a woman with a piece of
sewing in her hand came into the hall and spoke his name

Christopher you are late

Her voice was deep and musical with a richness of volume which
raised deluding hopes of an impassioned beauty in the
speakerwho as she crossed the illumined square of the
windowframe showed as a tall thin woman of forty years with
squinting eyes and a face whose misshapen features stood out
like the hasty drawing for a grotesque When she reached him
Christopher turned from the porch and they walked together
slowly out into the moonlight passing under the aspen where the
turkeys stirred and fluttered in their sleep

Has her cat come home Cynthia were the young mans first
anxious words

About sunset Uncle Boaz found her over at Aunt Daphnes
hunting mice under the joists Mother had fretted terribly over
the loss

Is she easier now

Much more so but she still asks for the port We pretend that
Uncle Boaz has mislaid the key of the winecellar She upbraided
him and he bore it so patiently poor old soul

Christopher quickly reached into the deep pocket of his overalls
and drew out the scanty wages of his last three days labour

Send this by somebody down to Tompkins he said and get the
wine he ordered He refuses to sell on credit any longer so I
had to find the money

She looked up startled

Oh Christopher you have worked for Fletcher

Tears shone in her eyes and her mouth quivered Oh
Christopher she repeated and the emotional quality in her
voice rang strong and true He fell back angered while the hand
she had stretched out dropped limply to her side

For Gods sake dont snivel he retorted harshly Send the
money and give her the wine but dole it out like a miser for
where the next will come from is more than I can tell

The pay for my sewing is due in three days said Cynthia
raising her roughened hand on which the needlescars showed even
in the moonlight Mother has worried so today that I couldnt
work except at odd moments but I can easily manage to sit up
tonight and get it done She thinks Im embroidering an ottoman
you see and this evening she asked to feel the silks

He uttered a savage exclamation

Oh I gave her some ravellings from an old tidy she hastened
to assure him She played with them awhile and knew no better
as I told her the colours one by one Afterward she planned all
kinds of samplers and firescreens that I might work Her own
knitting has wearied her of late so we havent been obliged to
buy the yarn

She doesnt suspect you think

Cynthia shook her head After fifteen years of deception theres
no danger of my telling the truth today I only wish I could
she added with that patient dignity which is the outward
expression of complete renouncement When she lifted her tragic
face the tears on her cheeks softened the painful hollows as the
moonbeams playing over her gown of patched and faded silk
revived for a moment the freshness of its discoloured flowers

The truth would be the death of her said the young man in a
bitter passion of anxiety Tell her that Fletcher owns the Hall
and that for fifteen years she has lived blind and paralysed in
the overseers house Why Id rather stick a knife into her
heart myself

Her terrible pride would kill heryes youre right Well keep
it up to the end at any cost

He turned to her with a sudden terror in his face She isnt
worse is she

Worse Oh no I only meant the cost to us the cost of never
speaking the truth within the house

Well Im not afraid of lying God knows he answered in the
tone of one from whom a burden has been removed Im only
wondering how much longer Ill be able to afford the luxury

But were no worse off than usual thats one comfort Mother is
quite happy now since Beulah has been found and the only added
worry is that Aunt Dinah is laid up in her cabin and weve had to
send her soup Uncle Isam has come to see you by the way I
believe he wants you to give him some advice about his little hut
up in the woods and to look up his birth in the servants
agebook too He lives five miles away you know and works
across the river at Farrars Mills

Uncle Isam exclaimed Christopher wonderingly why what do I
know about the man I havent laid eyes on him for the last ten
years

But he wants help now so of course hes come to you and as
hes walked all the distanceequally of coursehell stay to
supper Mother has her young chicken and theres bacon and
cornbread for the rest of us so I hope the poor man wont go
back hungry Ever since Aunt Pollys chimney blew down she has
had to fry the middling in the kitchen and mother complains so
of the smell She cant understand why we have it three times a
day and when I told her that Uncle Tucker acquired the habit in
the army she remarked that it was very inconsiderate of him to
insist upon gratifying so extraordinary a taste

Christopher laughed shortly

Well its a muck of a world he declared cheerfully taking
off his coarse harvest hat and running his hand through his
clustering fair hair In the mellow light the almost brutal
strength of his jaw was softened and his sunburned face paled to
the beauty of some ancient ivory carving Cynthia gazing up at
him caught her breath with a sob

How big you are and strong How fit for any life in the world
but this

Dont whimper he responded roughly adding after a moment
Precious fit for anything but the stable or the tobacco field
Why I couldnt so much as write a decently spelled letter to
save my soul A darky asked me yesterday to read a postbill for
him down at the store and I had to skip a big word in the first
line

He made his confession defiantly with a certain boorish pride in
his ignorance and his degradation

My dear my dear I wanted to teach youI will teach you now
We will read together

And let mother and Uncle Tucker plough the field and plant the
crop and cut the wood No it wont answer your learning would
do me no good and I dont want itI told you that when you
first took me from my study and put me to do all the chores upon
the place

I take you Oh Christopher what could we do Uncle Tucker was
a hopeless cripple there wasnt a servant strong enough to spade
the garden and there were only Lila and you and I

And I was ten Well Im not blaming you and Ive done what I
was forced tobut keep your confounded books out of my sight
thats all I ask Is that mother calling

Cynthia bent her ear I thought Lila was with her but Ill go
at once Be sure to change your clothes dear before she touches
you

Hadnt I better chop a little kindlingwood before supper

Nono not tonight Go and dress while I send Uncle Boaz for
the wine

She entered the house with a hurried step and Christopher after
an instants hesitation passed to the back and taking off his
clumsy boots crept softly up the creaking staircase to his
little garret room in the loft

Ten minutes later he came down again wearing a decent suit of
countrymade clothes with the dust washed from his face and his
hair smoothly brushed across his forehead In the front hall he
took a white rosebud from a little vase of Bohemian glass and
pinned it carefully in the lapel of his coat Then before
entering he stood for a moment silent upon the threshold of the
lamplighted room

In a massive Elizabethan chair of blackened oak a stately old
lady was sitting straight and stiff with her useless legs
stretched out upon an elaborately embroidered ottoman She wore a
dress of rich black brocade made very full in the skirt and
sleeves after an earlier fashion and her beautiful snowwhite
hair was piled over a high cushion and ornamented by a cap of
fine thread lace In her face which she turned at the first
footstep with a pitiable blind look there were the faint traces
of a proud though almost extinguished beautytraces which were
visible in the impetuous flash of her sightless eyes in the
noble arch of her brows and in the transparent quality of her
now yellowed skin which still kept the look of rare porcelain
held against the sunlight On a dainty rosedecked tray beside
her chair there were the half of a broiled chicken a thin glass
of port and a plate of buttered waffles and near her high
footstool a big yellow cat was busily lapping a saucer of new
milk

As Christopher went up to her she stretched out her hand and
touched his face with her sensitive fingers Oh if I could only
see you she said a little peevishly It is twenty years since
I looked at you and now you are taller than your father was you
say I can feel that your hair is light like his and like
Lilas too since you are twins

A pretty fragile woman who was wrapping a shawl about the old
ladys feet rose to her full height and passed behind the
Elizabethan chair Just a shade lighter than mine mother she
responded the sun makes a difference you know he is in the
sun so much without a hat As she stood with her delicate hands
clasped above the fancifully carved grotesques upon the
chairback her beauty shone like a lamp against the
smokestained walls

Ah if you could but have seen his father when he was young
Lila sighed her mother falling into one of the easy reveries
of old age I met him at a fancy ball you know where he went
as Achilles in full Grecian dress Oh the sight he was my dear
one of the few fair men among us and taller even than old
Colonel Fitzhugh who was considered one of the finest figures of
his time That was a wild night for me Christopher as Ive told
you often beforeit was love at first sight on both sides and
so marked were your fathers attentions that they were the talk
of the ball Edward Morristhe greatest wit of his day you
knowremarked at supper that the weak point of Achilles was
proved at last to be not his heel but his heart

She laughed with pleasure at the memory and returned in a
halfhearted fashion to her plate of buttered waffles Have you
been riding again Christopher she asked after a moment as if
remembering a grievance I havent had so much as a word from
you today but when one is chained to a chair like this it is
useless to ask even to be thought of amid your pleasures

I always think of you mother

Well Im glad to hear it my dear though Im sure I should
never imagine that you do Have you heard by the way that Boaz
lost the key of the winecellar and that I had to go two whole
days without my port I declare he is getting so careless that
Im afraid well have to put another butler over him

Lawd ole miss you ain gwine do dat is you anxiously
questioned Uncle Boaz as he filled her glass

She lifted the wine to her lips her stern face softening Like
many a highspirited woman doomed to perpetual inaction her
dominion over her servants had grown to represent the larger
share of life

Then be more careful in future Boaz she cautioned Tell me
Lila what has become of Nathan the son of Phyllis He used to
be a very bright little darkey twenty years ago and I always
intended putting him in the diningroom but things escape me so
His mother Phyllis I remember got some ridiculous idea about
freedom in her head and ran away with the Yankee soldiers before
we whipped them

Lilas face flushed for since the war Nathan had grown into one
of the most respectable of freedmen but Uncle Boaz with a glib
tongue started valiantly to her support

Go way ole miss dat ar Natan is de mos ornery un er de hull
bunch he declared Wen he comes inter my dininoom out Ise
gwine an days sho

The old lady passed a hand slowly across her brow I cant
rememberI cant remember she murmured but I dare say youre
right Boazand that reminds me that this bottle of port is not
so good as the last Have you tried it Christopher

Not yet mother Where did you find it Uncle Boaz

Hits des de same suh protested Uncle Boaz Dey wuz bofe un
um layin right side by side des like dey uz bon blood kin en
I done dus de cobwebs offn um wid de same duster dat I is

Well well that will do Now go in to supper children and
send Docia to take my tray Dear me I do wish that Tucker could
be persuaded to give up that vulgar bacon Im not so
unreasonable I hope as to expect a man to make any sacrifices
in this worldthats the womans part and Ive tried to take my
share of itbut to conceive of a passion for a thing like
baconI declare is quite beyond me

Come now Lucy dont begin to meddle with my whims protested
the cheerful tones of Tucker as he entered on his crutches one
of which was strapped to the stump of his right arm Allow me my
dissipations my dear and Ill not interfere with yours

Dissipations promptly took up the old lady from the hearth
Why if it were such a gentlemanly thing as a dissipation
Tucker I shouldnt say a wordnot a single word A taste for
wine is entirely proper Im sure and even a little intoxication
is permissible on occasionssuch as christenings weddings and
Christmas Eve gatherings Your father used to say Christopher
that the proof of a gentleman was in the way he held his wine
But to fall a deliberate victim to so lowborn a vice as a love
of bacon is something that no member of our family has ever done
before

Thats true Lucy pleasantly assented Tucker but then you
see no member of our family had ever fought three years for his
Stateto say nothing of losing a leg and an arm in her service

His fine face was ploughed with the marks of suffering but the
heartiness had not left his voice and his smile still shone
bright and strong From a proud position as the straightest shot
and the gayest liver of his day he had been reduced at a single
blow to the couch of a hopeless cripple Poverty had come a
little later but the second shock had only served to steady his
nerves from the vibration of the first and the courage which had
drooped within him for a time was revived in the form of a rare
and gentle humour Nothing was so terrible but Tucker could get a
laugh out of it people saidnot knowing that since he had
learned to smile at his own ghastly failure it was an easy matter
to turn the jest on universal joy or woe

The old ladys humour melted at his words and she hastened to
offer proof of her contrition Youre perfectly right brother
she said and I know Im an ungrateful creature so you neednt
take the trouble to tell me As long as you do me the honour to
live beneath my roof you shall eat the whole hog or none to your
hearts content

Then as Docia a large black woman with brass hoops in her
ears appeared to bear away the supper tray Mrs Blake folded
her hands and settled herself for a nap upon her cushions while
the yellow cat purred blissfully on her knees

Beyond the adjoining bedroom through which Christopher passed a
rude plank platform led to a long unceiled room which served as
kitchen and diningroom in one Here a cheerful blaze made merry
about an ancient crane on which a coffeeboiler swung slowly back
and forth with a bubbling noise In the red firelight a plain
pine table was spread with a scant supper of cornbread and bacon
and a cracked Wedgewood pitcher filled with buttermilk There was
no silver the china consisted of some odd broken pieces of old
willowware and beyond a bunch of damask roses stuck in a quaint
glass vase there was no visible attempt to lighten the effect of
extreme poverty An aged Negress in a dress of linseywoolsey
which resembled a patchwork quilt was pouring hot thin coffee
into a row of cups with chipped or missing saucers

Cynthia was already at the table and when Christopher came in
she served him with an anxious haste like that of a stricken
mother To Tucker and herself the coarse fare was unbearable even
after the custom of fifteen years and time had not lessened the
surprise with which they watched the young mans healthful
enjoyment of his food Even Lila whose glowing face in its
nimbus of curls lent an almost festive air to her end of the
white pine board ate with a heartiness which Cynthia with her
outgrown standard for her sex could not but find a trifle
vulgar The elder sister had been born to a different heritage
to one of restricted views and mincing manners for a
womanand despite herself she could but drift aimlessly on the
widening current of the times

Christopher will you have some coffeeit is stronger now she
asked presently reaching for his emptied cup

Dis yer stuff ain no cawfy grumbled Aunt Pony taking the
boiler from the crane hit ain nuttin but dishwater I don
cyar who done made hit Then as the door opened to admit Uncle
Isam with a bucket from the spring she divided her scorn equally
between him and the coffeepot

You neednt be acastin er you nets into dese yer pains she
observed cynically

Uncle Isam a dried old Negro of seventy years shambled in
patiently and placed the bucket carefully upon the stones to be
shrilly scolded by Aunt Polly for spilling a few drops on the
floor I reckon you is steddyin ter outdo Marse Noah she
remarked with scorn

Howdy Marse Christopher Howdy Marse Tuck Uncle Isam
inquired politely as he seated himself in a low chair on the
hearth and dropped his clasped hands between his open knees

Christopher nodded carelessly Glad to see you Isam Tucker
cordially responded Times have changed since you used to live
over here

Days so suh dots so Times deys done change but I
aintIse des de same Dats de tribble wid dis yer worl wen
hit change yo fortune hit don look ter changin yo skin es

spurt of smoke issued from the old stone chimney I dunno bout
dat Times deys right peart but I aint De vittles deys ready
ter do dar tun but de belly hit aint

Whatare you sick asked Cynthia with interest rising from
the table

Uncle Isam sighed Ise got a turable peskey feelin Miss

done come all dis way atter a dose er dem bitters ole miss use
ter gin us befo de wah

Well I never said Cynthia laughing I believe he means the
brown bitters mother used to make for chills and fever Im very
sorry Uncle Isam but we havent any We dont keep it any
longer

Leaning over his gnarled palms the old man shook his head in
sober reverie

Dar ain nuttin like dem bitters in dese yer days he
reflected sadly caze de smell er dem use ter mos knock you
flat fo you done taste em en all de way ter de belly dey use
ter keep awukin fur dey livin Lawd Lawd Ise done bought de

fifty years but we ain nuver sperunce de ceremony twel las
watermillion time

Why Uncle Isam did she leave you because of that Here draw
up to the table and eat your supper while I get down the
agebook and find your birth

She reached for a dusty account book on one of the kitchen
shelves and bringing it to the table began slowly turning the
yellowed leaves For more than two hundred years the births of
all the Blake slaves had been entered in the big volume

You des wait Miss Cynthy you des wait twel I git dar
remonstrated Uncle Isam as he stirred his coffee I ain got no
use fur dese yer newfangle fashions dots wat I tell de chillun

already for a lifetime

He finished his coffee at a gulp and leaned back in his chair

En now des fem me hyear how ole I is he wound up sorrowfully

The twelfth of August 18 thats the date of your birth

Thanky maam but I mus be gwine back agin responded Uncle
Isam shuffling to his feet en ef you don min Marse
Christopher Id like a wud wid you outside de do

Laughing Christopher rose from his chair and with a patriarchal
dignity of manner followed the old man into the moonlight



CHAPTER VI Carraway Plays Courtier

At twelve oclock the next day Carraway walking in the June
brightness along the road to the Blake cottage came suddenly at
the bend of the old icepond upon Maria Fletcher returning from a
morning ride The glow of summer was in her eyes and though her
face was still pale she seemed to him a different creature from
the grave repressed girl of the night before He noticed at once
that she sat her horse superbly and in her long black habit all
the sinuous lines of her figure moved in rhythm with the rapid
pace

As she neared him and apparently before she had noticed his
approach he saw her draw rein quickly and screened by the
overhanging boughs of a blossoming chestnut send her glance like
a hooded falcon across the neighbouring field Following the aim
of her look he saw Christopher Blake walking idly among the
heavy furrows watching with the interest of a born
agriculturist the busy transplanting of Fletchers crop He
still wore his jean clothes which hanging loosely upon his
impressive figure blended harmoniously with the dullpurple
tones of the upturned soil Beyond him there was a background of
distant wood still young in leaf and his bared head with the
strong sunburned line of his profile stood out as distinctly as
a portrait done in early Roman gold

That Maria had seen in him some higher possibility than that of a
field labourer was soon evident to Carraway for her horse was
still standing on the slight incline and as he reached her side
she turned with a frank question on her lips

Is that one of the labourersthe young giant by the fence

Well I dare say he labours if thats what you mean Hes young
Blake you know

Young Blake She bent her brows and it was clear that the name
suggested only a trivial recollection to her mind There used to
be some Blake children in the old overseers houseis this one
of them

Possibly they live in the overseers house

She leaned over fastening her heavy gauntlet They wouldnt
play with me I remember I couldnt understand why Once I
carried my dolls over to their yard and the boy set a pack of
hounds on me I screamed so that an old Negro ran out and drove
them off and all the time the boy stood by laughing and calling
me names Is that he do you think

I dare say It sounds like him

Is he so cruel she asked a little wistfully

I dont know about thatbut he doesnt like your people Your
grandfather had some trouble with him a long time ago

And he wanted to punish mehow cowardly

It does sound rather savage but it isnt an ordinary case you
know Hes the kind of person to curse root and branch from
all I hear in the good old Biblical fashion

Oh well hes certainly very large isnt he

Hes superb said Carraway with conviction

At a distanceso is that great pine over there she lifted her
whip and pointed across the field then as Carraway made no
answer she smiled slightly and rode rapidly toward the Hall

For a few minutes the lawyer stood where she had left him
watching in puzzled thought her swaying figure on the handsome
horse The girl fretted him and yet he felt that he liked her
almost in spite of himselfliked something fine and fearless he
found in her dark eyes liked too even while he sneered her
peculiar grace of manner There was the making of a woman in her
after all he told himself as he turned into the sunken road
where he saw Christopher already moving homeward He had meant to
catch up with him and join company on the way but the young man
covered ground so quickly with his great strides that at last
Carraway losing sight of him entirely resigned himself to going
leisurely about his errand

When a little later he opened the unhinged whitewashed gate
before the cottage the place as he found it seemed to be
tenanted solely by a family of young turkeys scratching beneath
the damask rosebushes in the yard From a rear chimney a dark
streak of smoke was rising but the front of the house gave no
outward sign of life and as there came no answer to his
insistent knocks he at last ventured to open the door and pass
into the narrow hall From the first room on the right a voice
spoke at his entrance and following the sound he found himself
face to face with Mrs Blake in her massive Elizabethan chair

There is a stranger in the room she said rigidly turning her
sightless eyes speak at once

I beg pardon most humbly for my intrusion replied Carraway
conscious of stammering like an offending schoolboy but as no
one answered my knock I committed the indiscretion of opening a
closed door

Awed as much by the stricken pallor of her appearance as by the
inappropriate grandeur of her black brocade and her thread lace
cap he advanced slowly and stood awaiting his dismissal

What door she demanded sharply much to his surprise

Yours madam

Not answer your knock she pursued with indignation So that
was the noise I heard and no wonder that you entered Why what
is the matter with the place Where are the servants

He humbly replied that he had seen none to be taken up with her
accustomed quickness of touch

Seen none Why there are three hundred of them sir Well
well this is really too much I shall put a butler over Boaz
this very day

For an instant Carraway felt strangely tempted to turn and run as
fast as he could along the sunken roadremembering as he
struggled with the impulse that he had once been caught at the
age of ten and whipped for stealing apples Recovering with an
effort his sense of dignity he offered the suggestion that Boaz
instead of being seriously in fault might merely have been
engaged in useful occupations somewhere at the back

What on earth can he have to do at the back sir inquired the
irrepressible old lady but since you were so kind as to
overlook our inhospitable reception will you not be equally good
and tell me your name

I fear it wont enlighten you much replied the lawyer
modestly but my name happens to be Guy Carraway

GuyGuy Carraway repeated Mrs Blake as if weighing each
separate letter in some remote social scales  Ive known many a
Guy in my dayand that part at least of your name is quite
familiar There was Guy Nelson and Guy Blair and Guy Marshall
the greatest beau of his timebut I dont think I ever had the
pleasure of meeting a Carraway before

That is more than probable maam but I have the advantage of
you since as a child I was once taken out upon the street
corner merely to see you go by on your way to a fancy ball where
you appeared as Diana

Mrs Blake yielded gracefully to the skilful thrust

Ah I was Lucy Corbin then she sighed You find few traces of
her in me now sir

Unfortunately your mirror cannot speak for me

She shook her head

Youre a flatterera sad flatterer I see she returned a
little wistfully but it does no harm as I tell my son to
flatter the old It is well to strew the passage to the grave
with flowers

How well I remember that day  said Carraway speaking softly
There was a crowd about the door waiting to see you come out
and a carpenter lifted me upon his shoulder Your hair was as
black as night and there was a circle round your head

A silver fillet she corrected with a smile in which there was
a gentle archness

A fillet yes and you carried a bow and a quiver full of
arrows I declare it seems but yesterday

It was more than fifty years ago murmured the old lady Well
well Ive had my day sir and it was a merry one I am almost
seventy years old Im half dead and stone blind into the
bargain but I can say to you that this is a cheerful world in
spite of the darkness in which I linger on Id take it over
again and gladly any daythe pleasure and the pain the light
and the darkness Why I sometimes think that my present
blindness was given me in order that I might view the past more
clearly Theres not a ball of my youth nor a face I knew nor
even a dress I wore that I dont see more distinctly every day
The present is a very little part of life sir its the past in
which we store our treasures

Youre right youre right replied Carraway drawing his chair
nearer the embroidered ottoman and leaning over to stroke the
yellow cat and Im glad to hear so cheerful a philosophy from
your lips

It is based on a cheerful experienceIve been as you see me
now only twenty years

Only twenty years He looked mutely round the soiled whitewashed
walls where hung a noble gathering of Blake portraits in massive
old gilt frames Among them he saw the remembered face of Lucy
Corbin herself painted under a rosegarland held by smiling
Loves

Life has its trials of course  pursued Mrs Blake as if
speaking to herself I cant look out upon the June flowers you
know and though the pink crapemyrtle at my window is in full
bloom I cannot see it

Following her gesture Carraway glanced out into the little yard
no myrtle was there but he remembered vaguely that he had seen
one in blossom at the Hall

You keep flowers about you though he said alluding to the
scattered vases of June roses

Not my crapemyrtle I planted it myself when I first came home
with Mr Blake and I have never allowed so much as a spray of it
to be plucked

Forgetting his presence she lapsed for a time into one of the
pathetic daydreams of old age Then recalling herself suddenly
her tone took on a sprightliness like that of youth

Its not often that we have the pleasure of entertaining a
stranger in our outoftheway house sir so may I ask where you
are stayingor perhaps you will do us the honour to sleep
beneath our roof It has had the privilege of sheltering General
Washington

You are very kind replied Carraway with a gratitude that was
from his heart but to tell the truth I feel that I am sailing
under false colours The real object of my visit is to ask a
business interview with your son I bring what seems to me a very
fair offer for the place

Grasping the carved arms of her chair Mrs Blake turned the
wonder in her blind eyes upon him

An offer for the place Why you must be dreaming sir A Blake
owned it more than a hundred years before the Revolution

At the instant understanding broke upon Carraway like a
thundercloud and as he rose from his seat it seemed to him that
he had missed by a single step the yawning gulf before him Blind
terror gripped him for the moment and when his brain steadied he
looked up to meet from the threshold of the adjoining room the
enraged flash of Christophers eyes So tempestuous was the
glance that Carraway impulsively falling back squared himself
to receive a physical blow but the young man without so much as
the expected oath came in quietly and took his stand behind the
Elizabethan chair

Why what a joke mother he said laughing he means the old
Weatherby farm of course The one I wanted to sell last year
you know

I thought youd sold it to the Weatherbys Christopher

Not a bit of itthey backed out at the last but dont begin to
bother your head about such things they arent worth it And
now sir he turned upon Carraway since your business is with
me perhaps you will have the goodness to step outside

With the feeling that he was asked out for a beating Carraway
turned for a farewell with Mrs Blake but the imperious old lady
was not to be so lightly defrauded of a listener

Business may come later my son she said detaining them by a
gesture of her heavily ringed hand After dinner you may take
Mr Carraway with you into the library and discuss your affairs
over a bottle of burgundy as was your grandfathers custom
before you meanwhile he and I will resume our very pleasant
talk which you interrupted He remembers seeing me in the old
days when we were all in the United States my dear

Christophers brow grew black and he threw a sharp and malignant
glance of sullen suspicion at Carraway who summoned to meet it
his most frank and open look

I saw your mother in the height of her fame he said smiling
so I may count myself one of her oldest admirers I believe You
may assure yourself he added softly that I have her welfare
very decidedly at heart

At this Christopher smiled back at him and there was something
of the June brightness in his look

Well take care sir he answered and went out closing the
door carefully behind him while Carraway applied himself to a
determined entertaining of Mrs Blake

To accomplish this he found that he had only to leave her free
guiding her thoughts with his lightest touch into newer channels
The talk had grown merrier now and he soon discovered that she
possessed a sharpened wit as well as a ready tongue From subject
to subject she passed with amazing swiftness bearing down upon
her favourite themes with the delightful audacity of the talker
who is born not made She spoke of her own youth of historic
flirtations in the early twenties of great beaux she had known
and of famous recipes that had been handed down for generations
Everywhere he felt her wonderful keenness of perception that
intuitive understanding of men and manners which had kept her for
so long the reigning belle among her younger rivals

As she went on he found that her world was as different from his
own as if she dwelt upon some undiscovered planeta world
peopled with shades and governed by an ideal group of abstract
laws She lived upon lies he saw and thrived upon the sweetness
she extracted from them For her the Confederacy had never
fallen the quiet of her dreamland had been disturbed by no
invading army and the three hundred slaves who had in reality
scattered like chaff before the wind she still saw in her
cheerful visions tilling her familiar fields It was as if she
had fallen asleep with the great blow that bad wrecked her body
and had dreamed on steadily throughout the years Of real changes
she was as ignorant as a newborn child Events had shaken the
world to its centre and she by her obscure hearth had not felt
so much as a sympathetic tremor In her memory there was no
Appomattox news of the death of Lincoln had never reached her
ears and president had peacefully succeeded president in the
secure Confederacy in which she lived Wonderful as it all was
to Carraway the most wonderful thing was the intricate tissue of
lies woven around her chair Liesliesthere had been nothing
but lies spoken within her hearing for twenty years



CHAPTER VII In Which a Stand is Made

Dim wonder was still upon him when Docia appeared bearing her
mistresss dinnertray and a moment later Cynthia came in and
paused uncertainly near the threshold

Do you wish anything mother

Only to present Mr Carraway my child He will be with us at
dinner

Cynthia came forward smiling and held out her hand with the
cordial hospitality which she had inherited with the family
portraits and the good old name She wore this morning a dress of
cheap black calico shrunken from many washings and beneath the
scant sleeves Carraway saw her thin red wrists which looked as
if they had been soaking in harsh soapsuds Except for a certain
ease of manner which she had not lost in the drudgery of her
life she might have been sister to the toilworn slattern he had
noticed in one of the hovels across the country

We shall be very glad to have you she said with quiet
dignity

It is ready now I think

Be sure to make him try the port Cynthia called Mrs Blake
as Carraway followed the daughter across the threshold

In the kitchen they found Tucker and Lila and a strange young man
in overalls who was introduced as one of the Weatherbys who
live just up the road He was evidently one of their plainer
neighbours for Carraway detected a constraint in Cynthias manner
which Lila did not appear to share The girl dressed daintily in
a faded muslin with an organdy kerchief crossed over her
swelling bosom flashed upon Carraways delighted vision like one
of the maidens hanging giltframed in the old ladys parlour
That she was the particular pride of the familythe one luxury
they allowed themselves besides their costly motherthe lawyer
realised upon the instant Her small white hands were unsoiled by
any work and her beautiful kindly face had none of the nervous
dread which seemed always lying behind Cynthias tired eyes With
the high devotion of a martyr the elder sister must have offered
herself a willing sacrifice winning for the younger an existence
which despite its gray monotony showed fairly rosecoloured in
comparison with her own She herself had sunk to the level of a
servant but through it all Lila had remained the lady
preserving an equable loveliness to which Jim Weatherby hardly
dared lift his wistful gaze

As for the young man himself he had a blithe open look which
Carraway found singularly attractive the kind of look it warms
ones heart to meet in the long road on a winters day Leaning
idly against the lintel of the door and fingering a bright axe
which he was apparently anxious that they should retain he
presented a pleasant enough picture to the attentive eyes within
the kitchen

Youd as well keep this axe as long as you want it he
protested earnestly  Its an old one anyway that I sharpened
when you asked for it and weve another at home thats all we
need

Its very kind of you Jim but ours is mended now replied
Cynthia a trifle stiffly

If we need one again well certainly borrow yours added Lila
smiling as she looked up from the glasses she was filling with
fresh buttermilk

Sit down Jim and have dinner with us theres no hurry urged
Tucker hospitably with a genial wave toward the meagerly spread
table Jims a great fellow Mr Carraway you ought to know
him He can manage anything from a Sundayschool to the digging
of a well Ive always said that if hed had charge of the
children of Israels journey to the promised land hed have had
them there fleshpots and all before the week was up

I can see he is a useful neighbour observed Carraway glancing
at the axe

Well Im glad I come handy  replied Jim in his hearty way
and are you sure you dont want me to split up that big oak log
at the woodpile I can do it in a twinkling

Cynthia declined his knightly offer to be overruled again by
Lilas smiling lips

Christopher will have to do it when he comes in  she said
poor Christopher he never has a single moment of his own

Jim Weatherby looked at her eagerly his blue eyes full of
sparkle Why I can do it in no time he declared shouldering
his axe and a moment afterward they heard his merry strokes from
the woodpile

Are you interested in tobacco Mr Carraway inquired Tucker
as they seated themselves at the pine table without so much as an
apology for the coarseness of the fare or an allusion to their
fallen fortunes If so youve struck us at the time when every
man about here is setting out his next winters chew Sol
Peterkin by the way has planted every square inch of his land
in tobacco and when I asked him what market he expected to send
it to he answered that he only raised a little for his own use

Is that the Peterkin who has the pretty daughter asked
Cynthia slicing a piece of bacon May I help you to turnip
salad Mr Carraway Uncle Boaz hobbling with rheumatism held
out a quaint old tray of inlaid woods and the lawyer as he
placed his plate upon it heaved a sigh of gratitude for the
utter absence of vulgarity He could fancy dear old Miss Saidie
puffing apologies over the fat bacon and Fletcher profanely
deploring the sloppy coffee

The halfgrown girl with the bunch of flaxen curls tied with a
blue ribbon returned Tucker while Lila cut up his food as if
he were a child Yes thats Molly Peterkin though its hard to
believe shes any kin to Sol I shouldnt wonder if she turned
into a bouncing beauty a few years further on

It was her father then that I walked over with from the
crossroads said Carraway He struck me as a shrewd man of his
sort

Oh hes shrewd enough rejoined Tucker and the proof of it
is that hes outlived three wives and is likely to outlive a
fourth I met him in the road yesterday and he told me that he
had just been off again to get married Good luck to you this
time Sol said I Wal it ought to be sir said he seeing
as marrying has got to be so costly in these days Why my first
wife didnt come to more than ten dollars counting the stovepipe
hat and all and this last ones mounted up to most a hundred
Try and take good care of her then I cautioned they come
too high to throw away Thats true sir he answered with a
sorrowful shake of his head But the trouble is that as the
price goes up the quality gets poorer My first one lasted near
on to thirty years and did all the chores about the house to
say nothing of the hogpen and if youll believe me sir the
one before this stuck at the hogfeeding on her wedding day and
then wore out before twelve months were up

He finished with his humorous chuckle and lifted his fork
skilfully in his left hand

I dare say he overvalues himself as a husband remarked
Carraway joining in the laugh but he has at least the merit of
being loyal to your family

Well I believe he has but then he doesnt like new folks or
new things I reckon Theres a saying that his hatred of changes
keeps him from ever changing his clothes

Christopher came in at the moment and with a slight bow to
Carraway slipped into his place

Whats Jim Weatherby chopping up that log for he asked
glancing in the direction of the ringing strokes

Cynthia looked at him almost grimly and there was a contraction
of the muscles about her determined mouth

Ask Lila she responded quietly As Christophers questioning
gaze turned to her Lila flushed rosepink and played nervously
with the breadcrumbs on the table

He said he had nothing else to do she answered with an
effort and he knew you were so busythat was all

Well hes a first rate fellow commented Christopher as he
reached for the pitcher of buttermilk but I dont see what
makes him so anxious to do my work

Oh thats Jims way you know put in Tucker with his offhand
kindliness Hes the sort of old maid who would undertake to
straighten the wilderness if he could get the job Why I
actually found him once chopping off dead boughs in the woods
and when I laughed he excused himself by saying that he couldnt
bear to see trees look so scraggy

As he talked his pleasant pale blue eyes twinkled with humour
and his full double chin shook over his shirt of common calico
He had grown very large from his long inaction and it was with a
perceptible effort that he moved himself upon his slender
crutches Yet despite his maimed and suffering body he was
dressed with a scrupulous neatness which was almost like an air
of elegance As he chatted on easily Carraway forgot in
listening to him the harrowing details in the midst of which he
satforgot the overheated smoky kitchen the common pine table
with its broken china and the sullen young savage whom he faced

For Christopher was eating his dinner hurriedly staring at his
plate in a moodiness which he did not take the trouble to
conceal With all the youthful beauty of his face there was a
boorishness in his illhumour which in a less commanding figure
would have been repellentan evident pride in the sincerity of
the scowl upon his brow When his meal was over he rose with a
muttered excuse and went out into the yard where a few minutes
afterward Carraway was bold enough to follow him

The afternoon was golden with sunshine and every green leaf on
the trees seemed to stand out clearly against the bright blue
sky In the rear of the house there was a lack of the careful
cleanliness he had noticed at the front and rotting chips from
the woodpile strewed the short grass before the door where a
clump of riotous ailanthus shoots was waging a desperate battle
for existence Beside the sunken wooden step a bare brown patch
showed where the daily splashes of hot soapsuds had stripped the
ground of even the modest covering that it wore Within a stones
throw of the threshold the half of a broken wheelbarrow white
with mould was fast crumbling into earth and a little farther
off stood a disorderly group of chicken coops before which lay a
couple of dead nestlings On the soaking plank ledge around the
wellbrink where fresh water was slopping from the overturned
bucket several bedraggled ducks were paddling with evident
enjoyment The one pleasant sight about the place was the sturdy
figure of Jim Weatherby still at work upon the giant body of a
dead oak tree

When Carraway came out Christopher was feeding a pack of hounds
from a tin pan of coarse corn bread and to the lawyers surprise
he was speaking to them in a tone that sounded almost jocular
Though born of a cringing breed the dogs looked contented and
well fed and among them Carraway recognised his friend Spy who
had followed at the heels of Uncle Boaz

Here Miser this is yours the young man was saying There
you neednt turn up your nose its as big as Blisters Down
Spy I tell you youve had twice your share you think because
youre the best looking youre to be the best fed too

As Carraway left the steps the dogs made an angry rush at him to
be promptly checked by Christopher

Back you fools back I say Youd better be careful how you
walk about here sir he added theyd bite as soon as notall
of them except Spy

Good fellow Spy returned Carraway a little nervously and
the hound came fawning to his feet I assure you I have no
intention of treading upon their preserves he hastened to
explain but I should like a word with you and this seems to be
the only opportunity Ill have as I return to town tomorrow

Christopher threw the remaining pieces of corn bread into the
wriggling pack set the pan in the doorway and wiped his hands
carelessly upon his overalls

Well I dont see what youve got to say to me he replied
walking rapidly in the direction of the well where he waited for
the other to join him

Its about the place of course returned the lawyer with an
attempt to shatter the awkward rustic reserve I understand that
it has passed into your possession

The young man nodded and drawing out his claspknife fell to
whittling a splinter which he had broken from the wellbrink

In that case pursued Carraway feeling as if he were dashing
his head against a wall I shall address myself to you in the
briefest terms The place I suppose as it stands is not worth
much today Even good land is cheap and this is poor

Again Christopher nodded intent upon his whittling I reckon it
wouldnt bring more than nine hundred he responded coolly

Then my position is easy for I am sure you will consider
favourably the chance to sell at treble its actual value I am
authorised to offer you three thousand dollars for the farm

For a moment Christopher stared at him in silence then What in
the devil do you want with it he demanded

I am not acting for myself in the matter returned the lawyer
after a short hesitation The offer is made through me by
another That it is to your advantage to accept it is my honest
conviction

Christopher tossed the bit of wood at a bedraggled drake that
waddled off quacking angrily

Then its Fletcher behind you he said in the same cool tones

It seems to me that is neither here nor there Naturally Mr
Fletcher is very anxious to secure the land As it stands it is
a serious inconvenience to him of course

Laughing Christopher snapped the blade of his knife

Well you may tell him from me he retorted that just as long
as it is a serious inconvenience to him it shall stand as it
is Why man if Fletcher wanted that broken wheelbarrow enough
to offer me three thousand dollars for it I wouldnt let him
have it The only thing Id leave him free to take if I could
help it is the straight road to damnation

His voice for all the laughter sounded brutal and Carraway
gazing at him in wonder saw his face grow suddenly lustful like
that of an evil deity The beauty was still there blackened and
distorted a beauty that he felt to be more sinister than
ugliness The lawyer was in the presence of a great naked
passion and involuntarily he lowered his eyes

I dont think he understands your attitude he said quietly
it seems to himand to me also I honestly affirmthat you
would reap an advantage as decided as his own

Nothing is to my advantage I tell you that isnt harm to him
He knows it if he isnt as big a fool as he is a rascal

Then I may presume that you are entirely convinced in your own
mind that you have a just cause for the stand you take

Cause the word rapped out like an oath He stole my home I
tell you he stole every inch of land I owned and every penny
Where did he get the money to buy the placehe a slaveoverseer
Where did he get it I ask unless he had been stealing for
twenty years

It looks ugly I confess admitted Carraway but were there no
booksno accounts kept

Oh he settled that of course When my father died and we
asked for the books where were they

Burned he saidburned in the old office that the Yankees fired
Hes a scoundrel I tell you sir and I know him to the core
Hes a rotten scoundrel

Carraway caught his breath quickly and drew back as if he had
touched unwittingly a throbbing canker To his oversensitive
nature these primal emotions had a crudeness that was vulgar in
its unrestraint He beheld it allthe old wrong and the new
hatredin a horrid glare of light a disgraceful blaze of
trumpets Here there was no cultured evasion of the conspicuous
vicenone of the refinements even of the Christian ethicsit
was all raw and palpitating humanity

Then my mission is quite useless he confessed I can only add
that I am sorrier than I can say sorry for the whole thing too
If my services could be of any use to you I should not hesitate
to offer them but so far as I see there is absolutely nothing to
be done An old crime as you know very often conforms to an
appearance of virtue

He held out his hand Christopher shook it and then the lawyer
went back into the house to bid goodby to Mrs Blake When he
came out a few moments later and passed through the whitewashed
gate into the sunken road he saw that Christopher was still
standing where he had left him the golden afternoon around him
and the bedraggled ducks paddling at his feet



VIII Treats of a Passion that is Not Love

Over a distant meadow fluted the silver whistle of a partridge
and Christopher lifting his head noted involuntarily the
direction of the sound A covey was hatching down by the meadow
brook he knewfor not a summer mating nor a hidden nest had
escaped his eyesand he wondered vaguely if the young birds were
roaming into Fletchers wheatfield Then with a single vigorous
movement as if he were settling his thoughts upon him he crossed
the yard leaped the fence by the barnyard and started briskly
along the edge of a little cattle pasture where a strange bull
bellowed in the shadow of a walnuttree At the bottom of the
pasture a crumbling rail fence divided his land from Fletchers
and as he looked over the festoons of poisonous ivy he saw
Fletcher himself overseeing the last planting of his tobacco For
a time Christopher watched them as through a mistwatched the
white and the black labourers the brown furrows in which the
small holes were bored the wilted plants thrown carelessly in
place and planted with two quick pressures of a bare
earthbegrimed foot He smelled the keen odours released by the
sunshine from the broken soil he saw the standing beads of sweat
on the faces of the plantersNegroes with swollen lips and
pleasant eyes like those of kindly animalsand he heard the
coarse hectoring voice of Fletcher who stood midway of the
naked ground To regard the man as a mere usurper of his land had
been an article in the religious creed the child had learned and
as he watched him now bearded noisy assured of his
possessions the sight lashed him like the strokes of a whip on
bleeding flesh In the twentyfive years of his life he had grown
fairly gluttonous of hatehad tended it with a passion that was
like that of love Now he felt that he had never really had
enough of ithad never feasted on the fruit of it till he was
satisfiedhad never known the delight of wallowing in it until
today Deeprooted like an instinct as the feeling was he knew
now that there had been hours when for very weakness of his
nature he had almost forgotten that he meant to pay back
Fletcher in the end when it seemed after all easier merely to
endure and forget and have it done Still keeping upon his own
land he turned presently and followed a little brook that
crossed a meadow where mixed wild flowers were strewn loosely in
the grass The bull still bellowed in the shadow of the
walnuttree and he found himself listening with pure delight to
the savage cries Reaching at last a point where the brook turned
westward at the foot of a low green hill he threw himself over
the dividing rail fence and came at the end of a minutes
hurried walk to the old Blake graveyard midway of one of
Fletchers fallow fields The gate was bricked up after the
superstitious custom of many country burial places but he
climbed the old mossgrown wall where poisonous ivy grew rank
and venomous and landing deep in the periwinkle that carpeted
the ground made his way rapidly to the flat oblong slab beneath
which his father lay The marble was discoloured by long rains
and stained with bruised periwinkle and the shallow lettering
was hidden under a fall of dried needles from a little stunted
firtree but leaning over he carefully swept the dust away and
loosened the imprisoned name which seemed to hover like a
spiritual presence upon the air

HERE LIES ALL THAT IS MORTAL OF CHRISTOPHER BLAKE WHO DIED IN
THE HOPE OF A JOYFUL RESURRECTION APRIL 12 1786 AGED 70 YEARS
INTO THY HANDS O LORD I COMMIT MY SPIRIT

Around him there were other gravesgraves of all dead Blakes for
two hundred years and the flat tombstones were crowded so
thickly together that it seemed as if the dead must lie beneath
them row on row It was all in deep shadow fallen slabs rank
periwinkle dust and mouldno cheerful sunshine had ever
penetrated through the spreading cedars overhead Life was here
but it was the shy life of wild creatures approaching man only
when he had returned to earth A mockingbird purled a love note
in the twilight of a great black cedar a lizard glided like a
gray shadow along one of the overturned slabs and at his
entrance a rabbit had started from the ivy on his fathers grave
To climb the overgrown wall and lie upon the periwinkle was like
entering for a time the world of shadesa world far removed
from the sunny meadow and the low green hill

With his head pillowed upon his fathers grave Christopher
stretched himself at full length on the ground and stared
straight upward at the darkbrowed cedars It was such an hour as
he allowed himself at long intervals when his inheritance was
heavy upon him and his disordered mind needed to retreat into a
city of refuge As a child he had often come to this same spot to
dream hopefully of the future unboylike dreams in which the
spirit of revenge wore the face of happiness Then with the
inconsequence of childhood he had pictured Fletcher gasping
beneath his feettrampled out like a worm when he was big
enough to take his vengeance and come again into his own Mere
physical strength seemed to him at that age the sole thing
neededhe wanted then only the brawny arm and the heart bound by
triple brass

Now as he stretched out his square sunburned hand with its
misshapen nails he laughed aloud at the absurdity of those
blunted hopes Today he stood six feet three inches from the
ground with muscles hard as steel and a chest that rang sound as
a bell yet how much nearer his purpose had he been as a little
child He remembered the day that he had hidden in the bushes
with his squirrel gun and waited with fluttering breath for the
sound of Fletchers footsteps along the road On that day it had
seemed to him that the hand of the Lord was in his own Godlike
vengeance nerving his little wrist He had meant to shootfor
that he had saved every stray penny from his sales of hogs and
cider of watermelons and chinkapins for that he had bought the
gun and rammed the powder home Even when the thud of footsteps
beat down the sunny road strewn with brown honeyshucks he had
felt neither fear nor hesitation as he crouched amid the
underbrush Rather there was a rare exhilaration warm blood in
his brain and a sharp taste in his mouth like that of unripe
fruitas if he had gorged himself upon the fallen honeyshucks
It was the happiest moment of his life he knew the one moment
when he seemed to measure himself inch by inch with fate and
like all such supreme instants it fell suddenly flat among the
passing hours For even as the gun was lifted at the very second
that Fletchers heavy body swung into view he heard a crackling
in the dead bushes at his back and Uncle Boaz struck up his arm
with a palsied hand

Gawd alive honey you don wanter be tucken out an hunged
the old man cried in terror

The boy rose in a passion and flung his useless gun aside Oh
youve spoiled it youve spoiled it he sobbed and shed bitter
tears upon the ground

To this hour lying on his fathers grave he knew that he
regretted that wasted powderthat will to slay which had blazed
up and died down so soon Strangely enough it soothed him now to
remember how near to murder he had been and as he drank the
summer air in deep drafts he felt the old desire rekindle from
its embers While he lived it was still possiblethe one chance
that awaits the ready hand the final answer of a sympathetic
heaven that deals out justice His god was a pagan god terrible
rather than tender and there had always been within him the old
pagan scorn of everlasting mercy There were moods even when he
felt the kinship with his savage forefathers working in his
blood and at such times he liked to fit heroic tortures to
heroic crimes to imagine the lighted stake and his enemy amid the
flames Over him as he lay at full length the ancient cedars
touched here and there with a younger green reared a dusky tent
that screened him alike from the hot sunshine and the bright June
sky Somewhere in the deepest shadow the mockingbird purled over
its single note and across the lettering on the marble slab
beside him a small brown lizard was gliding back and forth The
clean fresh smell of the cedars filled his nostrils like a balm

For a moment the physical pleasure in his surroundings possessed
his thoughts then gradually in a state between waking and
sleeping the curious boughs above took fantastic shapes and were
interwoven before his eyes with his earlier memories There was a
great tester bed with carved posts and curtains of silvery
damask that he had slept in as a child and it was here that he
had once had a terrible dreama dream which he had remembered to
this day because it was so like a story of Aunt Delishas in
which the devil comes with a redhot scuttle to carry off a
little boy On that night he had been the little boy and he had
seen the scuttle with its leaping flames so plainly that in his
terror he had struggled up and screamed aloud A moment later he
had awakened fully to find a lighted candle in his face and his
father in a flowered dressinggown sitting beside the bed and
looking at him with his sad bloodshot eyes Is the devil gone
father and did you drive him away he asked and then the tall
whitehaired old man whose mind was fast decaying did a strange
and a pitiable thing for he fell upon his knees beside the bed
and cried out upon Christopher for forgiveness for the
selfishness
of his long life You came too late my son he said you came
twenty years too late I had given you up long ago and grown
hopeless You came like Isaac to Abraham but too latetoo
late The boy sat up in bed huddling in the bedclothes for the
night was chilly He grew suddenly afraid of his father the big
beautiful old man in the flowered dressinggown and he wished
that his mother would come in and take him away But I came
twins with Lila father he replied trying to speak bravely
With Lila Oh my poor children my poor children cried the
old man and taking up his candle tottered to the door Then
Christopher stopped his ears in the pillows for he heard him
moaning to himself as he went back along the hall He felt all at
once terribly frightened and at last slipping down the tall
bedsteps he stole on his bare feet to Cynthias door and crept
in beside her After this dim years went by when he did not see
his father and the great closed rooms on the north side of the
house were as silent as if a corpse lay there awaiting burial
His beautiful stately mother who in spite of her gray hair
had always seemed but little older than himself vanished as
mysteriously from his sighton a thrilling morning when there
were many waving red flags and much hurried marching by of
grayclad troops Young as he was he was already beginning to
play his boys share in a war which was then fighting slowly to a
finish and in the wild flutter of events he forgot for a time
to do more than tip softly when he crossed the hall She was ill
they told himtoo ill to care even about the battles that were
fought across the river The sound of the big guns sent no
delicious shivers through her limbs and there was only Lila to
come with him when he laid his ear to the ground and thrilled
with the strong shock which seemed to run around the earth When
at last her door was opened again and he went timidly in holding
hands with Lila he found his mother sitting stiffly erect among
her cushions as she would sit for the remainder of her days
blind and half dead in her Elizabethan chair His beautiful
proud mother with the smiling Loves painted above her head

For an instant he shut his eyes beneath the cedars seeing her on
that morning as a man sees in his dreams the face of his first
love Then another day dawned slowly to his consciousnessa day
which stood out clearcut as a cameo from all the others of his
life For weeks Cynthias eyes had been red and swollen and he
commented querulously upon them for they made her homelier than
usual When he had finished she looked at him a moment without
replying then putting her arm about him she drew him out upon
the lawn and told him why she wept It was a mellow autumn day
and they passed over gold and russet leaves strewn deep along the
path A light wind was blowing in the treetops and the leaves
were still falling falling falling He saw Cynthias haggard
face in a flame of glowing colours Through the drumming in his
ears which seemed to come from the clear sky he heard the
ceaseless rustle beneath his feet and to this day he could not
walk along a leafstrewn road in autumn without seeing again the
blur of redandgold and the gray misery in Cynthias face

It will kill mother he said angrily It will kill mother
Why she almost died when Docia broke her Bohemian bowl

She must never know answered Cynthia while the tears streamed
unheeded down her cheeks When she is carried out one day for
her airing she shall go back into the other house It is a short
time now at bestshe may die at any moment from any shockbut
she must die without knowing this There must be quiet at the
end at least Oh poor mother poor mother

She raised her hands to her convulsed face and Christopher saw
the tears trickle through her thin fingers

She must never know repeated the boy She must never know if
we can help it

We must help it cried Cynthia passionately We must work our
fingers to the bone to help it you and I

And Lila asked the boy curiously just even in the intensity
of his emotion Mustnt Lila work too

Cynthia sobbedhard strangling sobs that rattled like stones
within her bosom

Lila is only a girl she said and so pretty so pretty

The boy nodded

Then dont lets make Lila work he responded sturdily

Selfish in her supreme unselfishness the woman turned and kissed
his brow while he struggled irritated to keep her off

Dont lets dear she said and that was all



IX Cynthia

As soon as Christopher had passed out of sight Cynthia came from
the kitchen with an armful of wet linen and began spreading it
upon some scrubby lilac bushes in a corner of the yard After
fifteen years it still made her uncomfortable to have Christopher
around when she did the family washing and when it was possible
she waited to dry the clothes until he had gone back to the
field In her scant calico dress with the furrows of age already
settling about her mouth and her pale brown hair strained in
thin peaks back from her forehead she might have stood as the
worldtype of toilworn womanhood for she was of the stuff of
martyrs and the dignity of their high resolve was her one
outward grace Life had been revealed to her as something to be
endured rather than enjoyed and the softer adornments of her sex
had not withstood the daily splashes of harsh soapsudsthey had
faded like colours too delicate to stand the strain of ordinary
use

As she lifted one of her mothers full white petticoats and
turned to wring it dry with her red and blistered hands a look
that was perilously near disgust was on her facefor though she
had done her duty heroically and meant to do it until the end
there were brief moments when it sickened her to desperation She
was the kind of woman whose hands perform the more thoroughly
because the heart revolts against the task

Lila in her faded muslin which had taken the colours of November
leaves came to the kitchen doorway and stood watching her with a
cheerful face

Has Jim Weatherby gone Cynthia

Cynthia nodded grimly turning her squinting gaze upon her Do
you think Id let him see me hanging out the clothes she
snapped Supreme as her unselfishness was there were times when
she appeared to begrudge the least of her services and after the
manner of all affection that comes as a bounty the unwilling
spirit was more impressive than the ready hand

I do wish you would make Docia help you said Lila in a voice
that sounded as if she were speaking in her own defense

Cynthia wrung out a blue jean shirt of Christophers spread it
on an old lilacbush and pushed a stray lock of hair back with
her wrist

Theres no use talking like that when you know Docia has heart
disease and cant scrub the clothes clean she responded If
shed drop down dead Id like to know what wed do with mother

Well Id help you if youd only let me protested Lila on the
point of tears Ive darned your lavender silk the best I could
and Id just as soon iron as not

And get your hands like mine in a week No I reckon its as
well for one of us to keep decent My hands are so knotted I had
to tell mother it was gout in the joints and she said I must
have been drinking too much port She laughed but her eyes
filled with tears and she wiped them with hard rubs on a twisted
garment which she afterward shook in the air to dry

Well youre a saint Cynthia and I wish you werent declared
Lila almost impatiently It makes me feel uncomfortable as if
it were somehow my fault that you had to be so good

Being a saint is a good deal like being a woman I reckon
returned Cynthia dryly Theres a heap in having been born to
it Aunt Polly have you put the irons on the fire The first
batch of clothes is almost dry

Aunt Polly an aged crone already stumbling into her dotage
hobbled from the kitchen and gathered up an armful of resinous
pine from a pile beside the steps Deys mos es hot es de
debbils wood en iron shovel she replied with one foot on the
step adding in a piercing whisper I know dat ar shovel honey
caze de debbil he done come fur me in de daid er de night

Aunt Polly chuckled with flattered vanity

De mo you git de likelier tis you gwine git one dats worth
gittin dats vat I low

Cynthia gathered up the scattered garments which had been left
carelessly from the day before and carried them into the
kitchen where a pine ironing board was supported by two empty
barrels Lila was busily preparing a bowl of gruel for one of the
sick old Negroes who still lived upon the meager charity of the
Blakes

Mother wants you Cynthia she said I wont do at all for
she cant be persuaded that Im really grown up you know Here
give me some of those clothes It wont hurt my hands a bit

Cynthia piled the clothes upon the board and moistening her
finger applied it to the bottom of the iron Then she handed it
to Lila with a funny little air of anxiety This is just right
she said be careful not to get your fingers burned and
remember to sprinkle the clothes well Do you know what mother
wants

I think its about taking something to Aunt Dinah Docia told
her she was sick

Then I wish Docia would learn to hold her tongue commented
Cynthia as she left the kitchen

She found Mrs Blake looking slightly irritated as she wound a
ball of white yarn from a skein that Docia was holding between
her outstretched hands

I hear Dinah is laid up with a stitch in her chest Cynthia
she said You must look in the medicine closet and give her ten
grains of quinine and a drink of whisky Tell her to keep well
covered up and see that Polly makes her hot flaxseed tea every
two hours

Lila is fixing her some gruel now mother

I said flaxseed tea my dear I am almost seventy years old and
I have treated three hundred servants and seen sixty laid in
their graves but if you think you are a better doctor than I am
of course theres nothing to be said Docia hold the yarn a
little tighter

Well make the flaxseed tea at once and Ill carry it right
overa breath of air will do me good

Mrs Blake sighed You mustnt stay too closely with me she
said you will grow old before your time I fear As it is you
have given up your young life to my poor old one

I had nothing to give up mother replied Cynthia quietly and
in the few words her hearts tragedy was writtensince of all
lives the saddest is the one that can find nothing worthy of
renouncement There were hours when she felt that any bitter
personal pastthat the recollection of a single despairing kiss
or a blighted love would have filled her days with happiness
What she craved was the conscious dignity of a broken heartsome
lofty memory that she might rest upon in her hours of weakness

Well you might have had my child returned her mother

Cynthias only answer was to smooth gently the pillows in the old
ladys chair If you could learn to lean back dearest it would
rest you so she said

I have never slouched in my life replied Mrs Blake
decisively and I do not care to fall into the habit in my
seventieth year When my last hour comes I hope at least to meet
my God in the attitude becoming a lady and in my day it would
have been considered the height of impropriety to loll in a chair
or even to rock in the presence of gentlemen Your Greataunt
Susannah one of the most modest women of her time has often
told me that once having unfortunately crossed her knees in the
parlour after supper she suffered untold tortures from budges
for three mortal hours rather than be seen to do anything so
indelicate as to uncross them Well well ladies were ladies in
those days and now Lila tells me it is quite customary for them
to sit like men My blindness has spared me many painful sights
I havent a doubt

Things have changed dear I wish they hadnt I liked the old
days too

Im glad at least to hear you say so Your Aunt Susannahand
she was the one who danced a minuet with General Lafayette you
knowused to say that patience and humility became a gentlewoman
better than satin and fine lace She was a lady of fashion and a
great beauty so I suppose her opinion counts for something
especially as she was noted for being the proudest woman of her
day and it was said that she never danced with a gentleman who
hadnt fought a duel on her account When she went to a ball it
took six small darkies to carry her train and her escort was
always obliged to ride on top of the coach to keep from rumpling
the flounces of her petticoat They always said that I had
inherited something of her face and step

Im sure she was never so beautiful as you mother

Ah well every one to his taste my child and I have heard
that she wore a larger shoe However this is foolish chatter
and a waste of time Go and carry Dinah the medicine and let me
see Christopher as soon as he comes in By the way Cynthia have
you noticed whether he seeks the society of ladies Do you think
it likely that his affections are engaged

No no not at all He doesnt care for girls Im sure of it

That seems very strange Why at his age his father had been
the object of a dozen love affairs and been jilted twice report
went though I had my suspicion from the first that it was the
other way Certainly Miss Peggie Stuart and he had once been
engaged to her went into a decline immediately after our
marriagebut in affairs of the heart as I have mentioned often
before the only reliable witnesses are those who never tell what
they know Now as for Christopher are you quite sure he is as
handsome as you say Quite quite hes splendidlike the
picture of the young David in the Bible Then theres something
wrong Does he cough His health seems perfect Which proves
conclusively that he cherishes a secret feeling For a man to go
twentysix years without falling in love means that hes either a
saint or an imbecile my dear and for my part I declare I dont
know which character sits worse upon a gentleman Can it be one
of the Morrisons do you think The youngest girl used to be
considered something of a beauty by the family though she was
always too nambypamby for my taste

Shes fifty by now if shes a day mother and the only thing I
ever saw Christopher do for her was to drive a strange bull out
of her road Well that sounds romantic but I fear as you
say shes really too old for him How time does fly Cynthia
stooped and carefully arranged the old ladys feet upon the
ottoman There nowIll carry the medicine to Aunt Dinah she
said and be back in plenty of time to dress for supper She
found the quinine in an old medicine chest in the adjoining room
and went with it to one of the crumbling cabins which had formed
part of the quarters in the prosperous days of slavery Aunt
Dinah insisted upon detaining her for a chat and it was half an
hour afterward that she came out again and walked slowly back
along the little falling path The mild June breeze freshened her
hot cheeks and as she passed thoughtfully between the coarse
sprays of yarrow blooming along the ragged edges of the fields
she felt her spirit freed from the days burden of unrest What
she wanted just then was to lie for an hour close upon the
ground to renew the vital forces within her by contact with the
invigorating earthto feel Nature at friendly touch with her
lips and hands She would have liked to run like a wild thing
through the golden sunshine lying upon the yarrow following the
shy cries of the partridges that scattered at her approachbut
there was work for her inside the house so she went back
patiently to take it up As she entered the little yard she saw
Tucker basking in the sunshine on an old bench beside one of the
damask rosebushes and she crossed over and stood for a moment
in the tall grass before him You look so happy Uncle Tucker
How do you manage it By keeping so I reckon my dear I tell
you this sun feels precious good on the back She dropped
limply on the bench beside him Yes it is pleasant but I
hadnt thought of it  Well youd think of it often enough if
you were in my place pursued Tucker always garrulous and
grateful for a listener I didnt notice things much myself when
I was young The only sights that seemed to count somehow were
those I saw inside my head and if youll believe me I used to
be moody and out of sorts half the time just like Christopher
Times have changed now youll say and its true Why Ive got
nothing to do these days but to take a look at things and I tell
you I see a lot now where all was a blank before You just glance
over that old field and tell me what you find Cynthia followed
the sweep of his left arm Theres first the road and then a
piece of fallow land that ought to be ploughed she said Bless
my soul is that all you see Why there is every shade of green
on earth in that old field and almost every one of blue except
azure which youll find up in the sky That little bit of white
cloud no bigger than my hand is shaped exactly like an eagles
wing Ive watched it for an hour and I never saw one like it
As for that old pine on top the little knoll if you look at it
long enough youll see that its a great big green cross raised
against the sky So it is  said Cynthia in surprise so it
is

Then to come nearer look at that spray of turtlehead growing by
that gray stonethe shadow it throws is as fine as thread lace
and it waves in the breeze just like the flower

 Oh it is beautiful and I never should have seen it

And best of all resumed Tucker as if avoiding an
interruption is that Ive watched a nestful of young wrens take
flight from under the eaves Theres not a play of Shakespeares
greater than that I tell you And it makes you happyjust
this asked Cynthia wistfully as the pathos of his maimed
figure drove to her heart Well I reckon happiness is not so
much in what comes as in the way you take it he returned
smiling There was a time you must remember when I was the
straightest shot of my day and something of a ladykiller as
well if I do say it who shouldnt Ive done my part in a war
and Im not ashamed of it Ive taken the enemys cannon under a
fire hot enough to roast an ox and Ive sent more men to
eternity than I like to think of but I tell you honestly theres
no battlefield under heaven worth an hour of this old bench If
I had my choice today Id rather see the flitting of those
wrens than kill the biggest Yankee that ever lived The time was
when I didnt think so but I know now that theres as much life
out there in that old field as in the tightestpacked city street
I ever sawpurer life praise God and sweeter to the taste
Why look at this poplar leaf that blew across the road Ive
studied the pattern of it for half an hour and Ive found out
that such a wonder is worth going ten miles to see Oh I cant
understand you sighed Cynthia hopelessly I wish I could but
I cantI was born differentso different Bless your heart
honey I was born different myself and if Id kept my leg and my
arm I dare say Id be strutting round on one and shaking the
other in the face of God Almighty just as I used to do A
twolegged man is so busy getting about the world that he never
has time to sit down and take a look around him I tell you I see
more in one hour as I am now than I saw in all the rest of my
life when I was sound and whole Why I could sit here all day
long and stare up at that blue sky and then go to bed feeling
that my twelve hours were full and brimming over If Id never
seen anything in my life but that sky above the old pine I
should say at the end Thank God for that one good look I
cant understandI cant understand repeated Cynthia in a
broken voice though her face shed a clear white beam I only
know that we are all in awful straights and that tomorrow is
the day when I must get up at five oclock and travel all the way
to town to get my sewing He laid his large pink hand on hers
Why not let Lila go for you What to wait like a servant for
the bundle and walk the streets all dayId go twenty times
first My dear you neednt envy me he responded patting her
knotted hand I took less courage with me when I stormed my
heights



CHAPTER X Sentimental and Otherwise

In the gray dawn Cynthia came softly downstairs and passing her
mothers door on tiptoe went out into the kitchen to begin
preparations for her early breakfast She wore a severe black
alpaca dress made from a castoff one of her mothers and below
her white linen collar she had pinned a cameo brooch bearing the
head of Minerva which had once belonged to Aunt Susannah On the
bed upstairs she had left her shawl and bonnet and a pair of
carefully mended black silk mitts for her monthly visits to the
little country town were endured with something of the frozen
dignity which supported Marie Antoinette in the tumbrel It was a
case where family pride was found more potent than Christian
resignation When she opened the kitchen door with her arms full
of resinous pine from the pile beside the steps she found that
Tucker had risen before her and was fumbling awkwardly in the
safe with his single hand Why Uncle Tucker she exclaimed in
surprise what on earth has happened Turning his cheerful face
upon her he motioned to a little wooden tobacco box on the bare
table A nest full of swallows tumbled down my chimney log in
the night he explained and they cried so loud I couldnt
sleep so I thought I might as well get up and dig em a worm or
two Do you happen to know where a bit of wool is Cynthia threw
her bundle of kindlingwood on the hearth and stood regarding him
with apathetic eyes Youd much better wring their necks she
responded indifferently but theres a basketful of wool Aunt
Polly has just carded in the closet How in the world did you
manage to dress yourself Oh its wonderful what one hand can
do when its put to it Would you mind fastening my collar by
the way and any buttons that you happen to see loose She
glanced over him critically pulling his clothes in place and
adjusting a button here and there I do hate to see you in this
old jean suit she said you used to look so nice in your other
clothes With a laugh he settled his empty sleeve Oh theyre
good for warm weather he responded and they wash easily
which is something Think too what a waste it would be to dress
half a man in a whole suit of broadcloth Oh dont dont
she protested on the point of tears but he smiled and patted
her bowed shoulder I got over that long ago honey he said
gently I kicked powerful hard with my one foot at first but
the dust I raised wasnt a speck in the face of God Almighty
There there well have a fine sunrise and Im going out to
watch it from my old benchunless youll find something for a
single hand to do She shook her head smiling with misty eyes

Youll have breakfast with me I suppose she said I got up
early because I couldnt sleep but its not yet four oclock
For an instant he looked at her gravely Worrying about the
day A little If I could only manage to hobble along with
you Oh but you couldnt dearand the worst of it is having
to wait so long in town for the afternoon stage I get my sewing
and then I eat my lunch on the old church steps and then there
are four mortal hours when I walk about aimlessly in the sun
And you wouldnt go to see anybody With my bundle of work
and in this alpaca Not for worlds He sighed not
reproachfully but with the sympathy which projects itself into
states of feeling other than its own Well I wish all the same
youd let Lila go in with you I think you make a mistake about
her Cynthia she wouldnt feel the strain of it half so much as
you do

But Id feel it for her No no its better as it is and she
does walk to the crossroads with me you know Old Jacob
Weatherby brings her back in his wagon Christopher cant get
off but hell come for me at sundown Are you sure it isnt
young Jim who fetches Lila She frowned If it were young Jim
her going would be impossiblebut the old man knows his place
and keeps it Its a better place than ours today I reckon
returned Tucker smiling To an observer across the road I dare
say the odds would seem considerably in his favour I met him in
the turnpike last Sunday in a brand new broadcloth

Oh I cant bear to hear you returned Cynthia passionately
If we must go to the dogs for heavens sake lets go
remembering that we are Blakesor Corbins if you like

Bless your heart child Id just as lief remember I was a Blake
or even a Weatherby for that matter Why Jacob Weatherbys
grandfather was an honest selfrespecting tiller of the soil
when mine used to fish his necktie out of the punch bowl every
Saturday night people said

She lifted her black skirt above her knees and pinned it tightly
at her back with a large safety pin she had taken from her bosom
Then kneeling on the hearth she laid the knots of resinous pine
on a crumpled newspaper in the great stone fireplace

I dont mind your picking flaws in me she said dryly but I
do wish you would let my great grandfather rest in his grave
Hes about all Ive got

Well I beg his pardon for speaking the truth about him
returned Tucker penitently and now my swallows are so noisy I
must stop their mouths

He went out humming a tune while Cynthia hung the boiler from
the crane and mixed the cornmeal dough in a wooden tray

When breakfast was on the table Lila appeared with a reproachful
face hurriedly knotting her kerchief as she entered

Oh Cynthia you promised to let me get breakfast she said
Mother was very restless all nightshe dreamed that she was
being married over againso I slept too late

It didnt matter dear I was awake and I didnt mind getting
up Are you ready to go

All except my hat Yawning slightly she raised her hands and
pushed up her clustering hair that was but a shade darker than
Christophers Trivial as the likeness was it began and ended
with her heavy curls for her hazel eyes held a peculiar liquid
beam and her face heartshaped in outline had none of the
heaviness of jaw which marred the symmetry of his A little brown
mole beside the dimple in her cheek gave the finishing touch of
coquetry to the oldworld quaintness of her appearance

As she passed the window on her way to the table she threw a
drowsy glance out into the yard

Why theres Uncle Tucker sitting on the ground she said he
must be crazy

Cynthia was pouring the hastily made coffee from the steaming
boiler and she did not look up as she answered

Youd better go out and help him up Hes digging worms for some
swallows that fell down his chimney

Well of all the ideas exclaimed Lila laughing but she went
out with cheerful sweetness and assisted him to his crutches

A halfhour later when the meal was over and Christopher had
gone out to the stable the two women tied on their bonnets and
went softly through the hall As they passed Mrs Blakes door
she awoke and called out sharply Cynthia is that you What are
you doing up so early Cynthia paused at strained attention on
the threshold Im going to the Morrisons mother to spend the
day You know I told you Miss Martha had promised to teach me
that new fancy stitch But my dear surely it is bad manners
to arrive before eleven oclock I remember once when I was a
girl that we went over to Meadow Hall before ten in the morning
and found old Mrs Dudley just putting on her company cap But
they begged me to come to breakfast dear Well customs
change of course but be sure to take Mrs Morrison a jar of the
green tomato catchup You know she always fancied it Yes yes
goodby till evening She moved on hurriedly her clumsy shoes
creaking on the bare planks and a moment afterward as the door
closed behind them they passed out into the first sunbeams
Beyond the whitewashed fence the old field was silvered by the
heavy dew and above it the great pine towered like a burnished
cross upon the western sky To the eastward a solitary thrush was
singinga golden voice straight from out the sunrise This is
worth getting up for said Lila with a long joyful breath and
she broke into a tender carolling as spontaneous as the birds
The bloom of the summer was in her face and as she moved with
her buoyant step along the red clay road she was like a rare
flower blown lightly by the wind To Cynthias narrowed eyes she
seemed indeed a heroine descended from old romancea maiden to
whom even in these degenerate modern days there must at last
arrive a noble destiny That Lila at the end of her twentysix
years should have wearied of her long waiting and grown content
to compromise with fate would have appeared to her impossibleas
impossible as the transformation of young Jim Weatherby into the
fairy prince

Hush she said suddenly shifting her bundle of sewing from one
arm to the other theres a wagon turning from the branch road
They had reached the first bend beyond the gate and as they
rounded the long curve hidden by honeylocusts a light spring
wagon came rapidly toward them with Jim Weatherby in his Sunday
clothes on the drivers seat Fathers rheumatism is so bad he
couldnt get out today he explained as he brought the horses
to a stand so as long as I had to take the butter over I
thought I might save you the five miles He spoke to Cynthia
and she drew back stiffly It is a pleasant day for a walk she
returned dryly But its going to be hot he urged I can tell
by the way the sun licks up the dew A feathery branch of the
honeylocust was in his face and he pushed it impatiently aside
as he looked at Lila I waited late just to take you he added
wistfully jumping from his seat and going to the horses heads
Wont you get in You will be so tired Cynthia Lila
persuaded Think of the walking you have to do in town As Jim
Weatherby glanced up brightly from the strap he was fastening
the smile in his blue eyes was like a song of love and when the
girl met it she heard again the solitary thrush singing in the
sunrise You will come he pleaded and this time he looked
straight at her

Well I reckon I will if youre going anyway said Cynthia at
last and if I drive with you therell be no use for Lila to go
she can stay with mother

But mother doesnt need me said Lila in answer to Jims
wistful eyes and its such a lovely dayafter getting up so
early I dont want to stay indoors

Without a word Jim held out his band to Cynthia and she climbed
with unbending dignity to the drivers seat You know youve
got that dress to turn Lila she said as she settled her stiff
skirt primly over her knees

I can do it when I get home answered Lila laying her hand on
the young mans arm and stepping upon the wheel Where shall I
sit Jim

Cynthia turned and looked at her coldly

Youd be more comfortable in that chair at the back she
suggested and Lila sat down obediently in the little
splitbottomed chair between a brown stone jar of butter and a
basket filled with newlaid eggs The girl folded her white hands
in the lap of her faded muslin and listened patiently to the
pleasant condescension in Cynthias voice as she discussed the
belated planting of the crops As the spring wagon rolled in the
shade of the honeylocusts between the great tobacco fields
striped with vivid green the June day filled the younger
sisters eyes with a radiance that seemed but a reflection of its
own perfect beauty Not once did her lover turn from Cynthia to
herself but she was conscious sitting quietly beside the great
brown jar that for him she filled the morning with her
presencethat he saw her in the blue sky in the sunny fields
and in the long red road with the delicate shadowing of the
locusts In her cramped life there had been so little room in
which her dreams might wander that gradually the romantic
devotion of her old playmate had grown to represent the measure
of her emotional ideal In spite of her poetic face she was in
thought soundly practical and though the plain Cynthia might
send a fanciful imagination in pursuit of the impossible to Lila
the only destiny worth cherishing at heart was the one that drew
its roots deep from the homely soil about her The stern class
distinctions which had always steeled Cynthia against the
friendly advances of her neighbours troubled the younger sister
not at all She remembered none of the past grandeur the old
Blake power of rule and the stories of gallant indiscretions and
powdered beaux seemed to her as worthless as the motheaten satin
rags which filled the garret She loved the familiar country
children the making of fresh butter and honest admiration of
her beauty and except for the colourless poverty in which they
lived she might easily have found her placid happiness on the
little farm With ambitionthe bitter agonised ambition that
Cynthia felt for hershe was as unconcerned as was her blithe
young lover chatting so merrily in the drivers seat The very
dullness of her imagination had saved her from the awakening that
follows wasted hopes

The tobacco looks well Cynthia was saying in her formal tones
all it needs now is a rain to start it growing Youve got yours
all in by now I suppose

Oh yes mine was put in before Christophers responded Jim
feeling instantly that the woman beside him flinched at his
unconscious use of her brothers name

He is always late she remarked with forced politeness and the
conversation dragged until they reached the crossroads and she
climbed into the stage

Be sure to hurry back were her last words as she rumbled off
and when in looking over her shoulder at the first curve she
saw Lila lift her beaming eyes to Jim Weatherbys face the
protest of all the dust in the old graveyard was in the groan
that hovered on her lips She herself would have crucified her
happiness with her own loyal hands rather than have dishonoured
by so much as an unspoken hope the high excellences inscribed
upon the tombstones of those mouldered dead

In her shabby black dress with her heavy bundle under her arm
she passed a lonely pathetic figure through the streets of the
little town The strange smells fretted her the hot bricks tired
her feet and the jarring noises confused her hazy ideas of
direction On the steps of the old church where she ate her
lunch she found a garrulous blind beggar with whom she divided
her slender meal of bacon and cornbread After a moments
hesitation she bought a couple of bananas for a few cents from a
fruitstand at the corner and coming back gave the larger one
to the beggar who sat complaining in the sun Then withdrawing
to a conventional distance in the shadow of the steeple she
waited patiently for the slow hours to wear away Not until the
long shadow pointed straight from west to east did the ancient
vehicle rattle down the street and the driver pull up for her at
the old church steps Then it was that with her first sigh of
relief she awoke to the realisation that through all the trying
day her heaviest burden was the memory of Lilas morning look
into the face of the man whose father had been a common labourer
at Blake Hall

Three hours later when pale and exhausted with an aching head
she found the stage halting beneath the blasted pine her
pleasantest impression was of Christopher standing in the yellow
afterglow beside the old spring wagon The driver spoke to him
and then as the horses stopped turned to toss the
weatherbeaten mailbag to the porch of the country store where
a group of men were lounging Among them Cynthia saw the figure
of a girl in a riding habit who as the stage halted gathered
up her long black skirt and ran hastily to the roadside to speak
to some one who remained still seated in the vehicle

That Christophers eyes followed the graceful figure in its
finely fitting habit Cynthia noticed with a sudden jealous pang
detecting angrily the warmth of the admiration in his gaze The
girl had met his look she knew for when she lifted her face to
her companion it was bright with a winters glow though the day
was warm She spoke almost breathlessly too as if she had been
running and Cynthia overhearing her first low words held her
prim skirt aside and descended awkwardly over the wheel She
stumbled in reaching the ground and the girl with a kindly
movement turned to help her I hope you arent hurt she said
in crisp clearcut tones but the elder woman recovering herself
with an effort passed on after an ungracious bow When she
reached Christopher he was still standing motionless beside the
wagon and at her first words he started like one awaking from a
pleasant daydream So you came after all he remarked in an
absentminded manner Of course I came She was conscious that
she almost snapped the reply Did you expect me to spend the
night in town In town Hardly He laughed gaily as he helped
her into the wagon then with the reins in his hands he turned
for a last glance at the stage Why what did you think I was
waiting for What you are waiting for now is more to the
purpose she retorted pressing her fingers upon her aching
temples The afterglow is fading come get in

Without a word he seated himself beside her and as he touched
the horses lightly with the whip the wagon rolled between the
green tobacco fields How delicious the wild grape is
exclaimed Cynthia drawing her breath I hope the horses arent
tired Have they been at the plough Not since dinner time It
was clear that his mind was still abstracted and he kept his
face turned toward the pale red line that lingered on the western
horizon This is a queer kind of life he said presently still
looking away from her We are so poor and so shut in that we
have no idea what people of the world are really like That girl
out there at the crossroads now she was different from any one
Id ever seen Did you hear where she came from I didnt ask
Cynthia replied compressing her lips I didnt like the way she
stared Stared At you No at you Im glad you didnt
notice it It was bold to say the least Throwing back his
head he laughed with boyish merriment and she saw as he turned
his face toward her that his heavy hair had fallen low across
his forehead giving him a youthful look that became him
strangely At the instant she softened in her judgment of the
unknown woman at the crossroads Why she thought I was some
queer beast of burden I reckon he returned some new farm
animal that made her a little curious Well whoever she may be
she walked as if she felt herself a princess Cynthia snorted
Her habit fitted her like a glove was her comment to which
she added after a pause As things go its just as well you
didnt hear what she said I reckon About me do you mean
She came down to meet another girl pursued Cynthia coolly I
was getting out so I dont suppose they noticed mea shabby old
creature with a bundle At any rate when she kissed the other
she whispered something I didnt hear and then Ive seen that
man beforelook That was when I stumbled and that made me
catch the next Where her friend asked her quickly and she
answered There was a pause in which the warm dusk was
saturated with the fragrance of the grape blossoms on the fence
She answered repeated Christopher slowly Cynthia looked up
and down the road and then gave the words as if they were a
groan In my dreams


BOOK II  THE TEMPTATION



CHAPTER I The Romance that Might have Been

With July there came a long rain and in the burst of sunshine
which followed it the young tobacco shot up fine and straight and
tall clothing the landscape in a rich tropical green

From morning till night the men worked now in the great fields
removing the numerous suckers from the growing plants and
pinching off the slender tops to prevent the first beginnings of
a flower except where at long spaces a huge pink cluster would
be allowed to blossom and come to seed

Christopher toiling all day alone in his own field felt the
clear summer dawn break over him the golden noon gather to full
heat and the coming night envelop him like a purple mist
Living as he did so close to the earth himself akin to the
strong forces of the soil he had grown gradually from his
childhood into a rare physical expression of the large freedom of
natural things

It was an unusually hot day in midAugustthe time of the
harvest moon and of the dreaded tobacco flythat he came home at
the dinner hour to find Cynthia standing spent and pale beside
the well

The sun is awful Christopher I dont see how you bear it but
it makes your hair the colour of ripe wheat

Oh I dont mind the sun he answered laughing as he wiped the
sweat from his face and stooped for a drink from the tilted
bucket Im too much taken up just now with fighting those
confounded tobacco flies They were as thick as thieves last
night

Uncle Boaz is going to send the little darkies out to hunt them
at sundown returned Cynthia Ive promised them an apple for
every one they catch

Her gaze wandered over the broad fields rich in promise and she
added after a moment Fletchers crop has come on splendidly

The mores the pity

For a long breath she looked at him in silence at the massive
figure the face burned to the colour of terracotta the thick
wheatenbrown hair then with an impulsive gesture she spoke in
her wonderful voice which held so many possibilities of passion

I didnt tell you Christopher that Id found out the name of
the girl at the crossroads She went away the day afterward and
just got back yesterday

Something in her tone made the young man look up quickly his
face paling beneath the sunburn

All the boyish cheerfulness he had worn of late faded suddenly
from his look

Who is she he asked

Jim Weatherby knew He had seen her several times on horseback
and he says shes Maria Fletcher that ugly little girl grown
up She hates the life here he says and they think she is going
to marry before the winter Fletcher was talking down at the
store about a rich man who is in love with her

Christopher stooped to finish his drink and then rose slowly to
his full height

Well one Fletcher the less will be a good riddance he said
harshly as he went into the house

In the full white noon he returned to the field working steadily
on his crop until the sunset Back and forth among the tall green
plants waist deep in their rank luxuriance he passed with
careful steps and attentive eyes avoiding the huge sand leaves
spreading upon the ground and already yellowing in the August
weather As he searched for the hidden suckers along the great
juicy stalks he removed his hat lest it should bruise the tender
tops and the golden sunshine shone full on his bared head

Around him the landscape swept like an emerald sea over which
the small shadows rippled in passing waves beginning at the rail
fence skirting the red clay road and breaking at last upon the
darker green of the faroff pines Here and there a tall pink
blossom rose like a fantastic sail from the deep and rocked
slowly to and fro in the summer wind When at last the sun
dropped behind the distant wood and a red flame licked at the
western clouds he still lingered on dreaming idly while his
hands followed their accustomed task Big green moths hovered
presently around him seeking the deep rosy tubes of the
clustered flowers and alighting finally to leave their
dangerbreeding eggs under the drooping leaves The sound of
laughter floated suddenly from the small Negro children who were
pursuing the tobacco flies between the furrows He had ceased
from his work and come out into the little path that trailed
along the edge of the field when he saw a womans figure in a
gown coloured like April flowers pass from the new road over the
loosened fencerails For a breathless instant he wavered in the
path then turning squarely he met her questioning look with
indifferent eyes The new romance had shriveled at the first
touch of the old hatred Maria holding her skirt above her
ruffled petticoat stood midway of the little trail a single
tobacco blossom waving over her leghorn hat She was no longer
the pale girl who had received Carraway with so composed a
bearing for her face and her gown were now coloured delicately
with an April bloom I followed the new road she explained
smiling and all at once it ended at the fence Where can I take
it up again He regarded her gravely The only way you can take
it up again is to go back to it he answered It doesnt cross
my land you know andI beg your pardonbut I dont care to
have you do so Besides staining your dress you will very likely
bruise my tobacco He had never in his life stood close to a
woman who wore perfumed garments and he felt all at once that
her fragrance was going to his brain Delicate as it was he
found it heady like strong drink But I could walk very close
to
the fence said the girl surprised Arent you afraid of the
poisonous oak Desperately I caught it once as a child It
hurt so He shook his head impatiently Apart from that there
is no reason why you should come on my land All the prettiest
walks are on the other sideand over here the hounds are taught
to warn off trespassers Am I a trespasser You are worse
he replied boorishly youre a Fletcher Well youre a
savage she retorted angered in her turn Is it simply because
I happen to be a Fletcher that you become a bear Because you
happen to be a Fletcher he repeated and then looked calmly and
coolly at her dainty elegance

And if I were anybody else I suppose you would let me walk
along that fence and even be polite enough to keep the dogs from
eating me up If you were anybody else and didnt injure my
tobaccoyes

But as it is I must keep away

All I ask of you is to stay on the other side And if I
dont she questioned her spirit flaring up to match with his
and if I dont All the natural womanhood within her responded
to the appeal of his superb manhood all the fastidious
refinement with which she was overlaid was alive to the rustic
details which marred the finished wholeto the streak of earth
across his forehead to the coarseness of his illfitting
clothes to the tobacco juice staining his finger nails bright
green On his side the lady of his dreams had shrunken to a
witch and he shook his head again in an effort to dispel the
sweetness that so strangely moved him In that case you will
meet the hounds one day and get your dress badly torn I fear
And bitten probably Probably Well I dont think it would
be worth it said the girl in a quiver of indignation If I
can help it I shall never set my foot on your land again The
wisest thing you can do is to keep off he retorted Turning
with an angry movement she walked rapidly to the fence heedless
of the poisonous oak along the way and Christopher passing her
with a single step lowered the topmost rails that she might
cross over the more easily Thank you she said stiffly as she
reached the other side It was a pleasure he responded in the
tone his father might have used when in full Grecian dress at the
fancy ball You mean it is a pleasure to assist in getting rid
of me

What I mean doesnt matter he answered irritably and added
I
wish to God you were anybody else At this she turned and faced
him squarely as he held the rails But how can I help being
myself she demanded You cant and theres an end of it Of
what Oh of everythingand most of all of the evening at the
crossroads You saw me then she asked You know I did he
answered retreating into his rude simplicity And you liked me
then

Then he laughed why I was fool enough to dream of you for a
month afterward How dare you she cried Well I shant do
it again he assured her insolently You cant possibly dislike
me any more than I do you she remarked drawing back step by
step Youre a savage and a mean one at thatbut all the same
I should like to know why you began to hate me He laid the
topmost rail along the fence and turned away Ask your
grandfather he called back as he passed into the tobacco
field with her fragrance still in his nostrils

Maria on the other side walked slowly homeward along the new
road that had ended so abruptly Her lip trembled and letting
her skirt drag in the dust she put up her hand to suppress the
first hint of emotion It angered her that he had had the power
to provoke her so and for the moment the encounter seemed to
have bereft her of her last shreds of womanly reserve It was as
if a strong wind had blown over her laying her bosom bare and
she flushed at the knowledge that he had heard the fluttering of
her breath and seen the indignant tears gather to her eyeshe a
boorish stranger who hated her because of her name For the first
time in her life she had run straight against an impregnable
prejudicehad felt her feminine charm ineffectual against a
stern masculine resistance She was at the age when the
artificial often outweighs the realwhen the superficial manner
with a woman is apt to be misunderstood and so to her
Christopher Blake now appeared stripped even of his physical
comeliness the interview had left her with an impression of mere
vulgar incivility As she entered the house she met Fletcher
passing through the hall with the mailbag in his hand and a
little later while she sat in a big chair by her chamber window
Miss Saidie came in and laid a letter in her lap Its from Mr
Wyndham I think Maria Shall I light a candle Not yet it is
so warm I like the twilight But wont you read the letter
Oh presently Theres time enough Miss Saidie came to the
window and leaned out to sniff the climbing roses her shapeless
figure outlined against the purple dusk spangled with fireflies
Her presence irritated the girl who stirred restlessly in her
chair Is he coming Maria do you think

If I let himyes And he wants to marry you The girl
laughed bitterly He hasnt seen me in my home yet she
answered and our vulgarity may be too much for him Hes very
particular you know The woman at the window flinched as if she
had been struck But if he loves you Maria Oh he loves me
for what isnt me she answered for my culture as he calls
itfor the gloss that has been put over me in the last ten
years Still if you care for him dear I dont knowI
dont know said Maria speaking in the effort to straighten her
disordered thoughts rather than for the enlightenment of Miss
Saidie I was sure I loved him before I came homebut this
place upsets me soI hate it It makes me feel raw crude
unlike myself When I come back here I seem to lose all that I
have learned and to grow vulgar like Jinnie Spade at the
store Not like her Maria Well I ought to know better of
course but I dont believe I donot when Im here Then why
not go away Dont think of us we can get along as we used to
do I dont think of you said the girl I dont think of
anybody in the world except myselfand thats the awful
partthats the part I hate Im selfish to the core and I know
it

But you do love Jack Wyndham Oh I love him to distraction
Light the candle Aunt Saidie and let me read his letter I can
tell you word for word what is in it before I break the seal
Six months ago I went into a flutter at the sight of his
handwriting Six months before that I was madly in love with Dick
Brightand six months from todayOh well I suppose I really
havent much heart to knowand if I ever care for anybody it
must be for Jackthats positive

Standing beside the lighted candle on the bureau she read the
letter twice over and then turning away wrote her answer
kneeling beside the big chair at the window



CHAPTER II The Romance that Was

Waking in the night she said again I love him to distraction
and slipping under the dimity curtains of the bed sought his
letter where she had left it on the bureau The full light of the
harvest moon was in the rooma light so soft that it lay like a
yellow fluid upon the floor It seemed almost as if one might
stoop and fill the open palms

She found the letter thrown carelessly upon the pincushion and
holding it to her lips paused a moment beside the window
looking beyond the shaven lawn and the clustered oaks to where
the tobacco fields lay golden beneath the moon It was such a
night as seemed granted by some kindly deity for the fulfillment
of lovers vows and the girl standing beside the open window
grew suddenly sad as one who sees a vision with the knowledge
that it is not life When presently she went back to bed it was
to lie sleepless until dawn with the love letter held tightly in
her hands

The next day a restlessness like that of fever worked in her
blood and she ran from turret to basement of the roomy old
house calling Will to come and help her find amusement

Play ball with me Will she said I feel as if I were a child
today  Oh its no fun playing with a girl replied the boy
besides I am going fishing in the river with Zebbadee Blake I
shant be back till supper and shouldering his fishingrod he
flung off with his can of worms Miss Saidie was skimming big
pans of milk in the springhouse and Maria watched her idly for
a time growing suddenly impatient of the leisurely way in which
the spoon travelled under the yellow cream I dont see how you
can be so fond of it she said at last Lord child I never
could abide dairy work responded Miss Saidie setting the
skimmed pan aside and carefully lifting another from the flat
stones over which a stream of water trickled And yet youve
done nothing else all your long life wondered Maria When it
comes to doing a thing in this world returned the little woman
removing a speck of dust from the cream with the point of the
spoon I dont ask myself whether I like it or not but whats
the best way to get it done Ive spent sixty years doing things
I wasnt fond of and I dont reckon Im any the less happy for
having done em well But I should be asserted Maria and
then with her white parasol over her bared head she started for
a restless stroll along the old road under the great chestnuts
She had reached the abandoned icepond and was picking her way
carefully in the shadow of the trees when the baying of a pack
of hounds in full cry broke on her ears and with the nervous
tremor she had associated from childhood with the sound she
stopped short in the road and waited anxiously for the hunt to
pass Even as she hesitated feeling in imagination all the blind
terror of the pursuit and determined to swing into a chestnut
bough in case of an approach a small animal darted suddenly from
around the bend in the sunken road and an instant afterward the
hounds in hot chase broke from the cover For a single breath the
girl dropping her parasol looked at the lowered branch then as
the small animal neared her her glance fell and she saw that it
was a little yellow dog with hanging red tongue and eyes bulging
in terror From side to side of the red clay road the creature
doubled for a moment in its anguish and then with a spring
straight as the flight of a homing bird fled to the shelter of
Marias skirts Quick as a heartbeat the girls personal fears
had vanished and as an almost savage instinct of battle awoke in
her she stooped with a protecting movement and picking the
small dog from the ground held him high above her head as the
hounds came on A moment before her limbs had shaken at the
distant cries now facing the immediate presence of the danger
she felt the rage of her pity flow like an infusion of strong
blood through her veins Until they dashed her to the ground she
knew that she would stand holding the hunted creature above her
head Like a wave the pack broke instantly upon her forcing her
back against the body of the chestnut and tearing her dress at
the first blow from her bosom to the ground She had felt their
weight upon her breast their hot breath full in her face when
in the midst of the confused noises in her ears she heard a loud
oath that rang out like a shot followed by the strokes of a
rawhide whip on living flesh So close came the lash that the
curling end smote her cheek and left a thin flame from ear to
mouth The lessening sounds became all at once like the silence
and when the hounds beaten back slunk whimpering to heel she
lowered her eyes until she looked straight into the face of
Christopher Blake My God You have pluck he said and his
face was like that of a dead man Still holding the dog above her
head she lay motionless against the body of the tree Drive the
beasts away she pleaded like a frightened child Without a word
he turned and ordered the hounds home and they crawled
obediently back along the sunken road Then he looked at her
again I saw them start the dog on my land he said and I ran
across the field as soon as I could find my whip If I hadnt
come up when I did they would have torn you to pieces Not
another man in the world could have brought them in Look at your
dress Glancing down she followed the long slit from bosom to
hem I hate them she exclaimed fiercely So it was your dog
they started Mine She lowered the yellow cur holding him
close in her arms where he nestled shivering I never saw him
before but hes mine now I saved him I shall name him Agag
because the bitterness of death is past Well ratherLook
here he burst out impulsively youve got the staunchest pluck
I ever saw I never knew a man brave enough to stand up against
those houndsand youwhy I dont believe you flinched an
eyelash andby George the dog wasnt yours after all  As if
that made a difference she flashed out Why he ran to me for
helpand they might have killed me but Id never have given him
up

I believe you he declared She was conscious of a slight
thrill that passed quickly leaving her white and weak I feel
tired she said pressing hard against the tree Will you be so
good as to pick up my parasol Tired he exclaimed and after
a moment Your face is hurtdid the dogs do it She shook her
head You struck me with your whip Is that so I cant say
after this that I never lifted my hand against a womanbut harsh
measures are sometimes necessary I reckon Does it smart She
touched the place lightly Oh its no matter she returned I
suppose I ought really to thank you for taking the trouble to
save my life but I dont because after all the hounds are
yours you know Yes I know and theyre good hounds too in
their way The dog had no business on their land And theyre
taught to warn off trespassers Well I hardly fancy their manner
of conveying the hint It is sometimes useful all the while

Ah in case of a Fletcher I presume

In case of a Fletcher he repeated his face darkening do you
know I had entirely forgotten who you were

Its time you were remembering it she returned for I am most
decidedly a Fletcher

For an instant he scowled upon her

Then you are most decidedly a devil was his retort as he
stooped to pick up her parasol from the road Theres not much
left of it he remarked handing it to her

As things go I dare say I ought to be grateful that they spared
the spokes she said impatiently It does seem disagreeable
that I cant go for a short stroll along my own road without the
risk of having my clothes torn from my back You really must keep
your horrid beasts from becoming a public danger

They never chase anything that keeps off my farm he replied
coolly Theres not so well trained a pack anywhere in the
county No other dogs around here could have been beaten back at
the death

I fear that doesnt afford me the gratification you seem to
feelparticularly as the death you allude to would have been
mine I suppose I ought to be overpowered with gratitude for the
whole thing but unfortunately Im not I have had a very
unpleasant experience and I cant help feeling that I owe it to
you

Youre welcome to feel about it anyway you please he
responded as Maria tucking the dog under her arm started down
the road to the Hall the tattered parasol held straight above
her head

At the house she carried Agag to her room where she spent the
afternoon in the big chair by the window Miss Saidie coming in
with her dinner inquired if she were sick and then picked up
the torn dress from the bed

Why Maria how on earth did you do it

Some hounds jumped on me in the road

Well I never They were those dreadful Blake beasts I know I
declare Ill go right down and speak to Brother Bill about em

For heavens sake dont protested the girl Weve had
quarrelling enough as it isand tell me Aunt Saidie have you
ever known what it was all about

Miss Saidie was examining the rent with an eye to a possible
mending and she did not look up as she answered I never
understood exactly myself but your grandpa says they squandered
all their money and then got mad because they had to sell the
place Thats about the truth of it I reckon

The Hall belonged to them once didnt it

Oh a long time ago when they were rich Sakes alive Maria
whats the matter with your face

I struck it getting away from the hounds Its too bad isnt
it And Jack coming so soon too Do I look very ugly

Youre a perfect fright now but Ill fix you a liniment to draw
the bruise away It will be all right in a day or two I declare
if you havent gone and brought a little pofolksy yellow dog
into the house Maria was feeding Agag with bits of chicken from
her plate bending over him as he huddled against her dress

I found him in the road she returned and Im going to keep
him I saved him from the hounds

Well it seems to me you might have got a prettier one
remarked Miss Saidie as she went down to mix the liniment

It was several mornings after this that Fletcher coming into the
diningroom where Maria sat at a late breakfast handed her a
telegram and stood waiting while she tore it open

Jim Weatherby brought it over from the crossroads he said It
got there last night

I hope theres nobody dead child observed Miss Saidie from
the servingtable where she was peeling tomatoes

More likely it points to a marriage eh daughter chuckled
Fletcher jocosely

The girl folded the paper and replaced it carefully in the
envelope Its from Jack Wyndham she said and he comes this
evening May I take the horses to the crossroads grandpa

Well I did have a use for them responded Fletcher in high
goodnature but seeing as your young fellow doesnt come every
day I reckon Ill let you have em out

Maria flinched at his speech and then as the clear pink spread
evenly in her cheeks she spoke in her composed tones I may as
well tell you grandpa that we shall marry almost immediately
she said



CHAPTER III Fletchers Move and Christophers Counterstroke

Not until September when he lounged one day with a glass of beer
in the little room behind Tom Spades country store did
Christopher hear the news of Marias approaching marriage It was
Sol Peterkin who delivered it hiccoughing in the enveloping
smoke from several pipes as he sat astride an overturned flour
barrel in one corner

I jest passed a wagonload of finery on the way to the Hall he
said bulging with importance Its for the gals weddin I
reckon an they do say shes a regular Jezebel as far as clothes
go I met her yestiddy with her young man that is to be an the
way she was dressed up wasnt a sight for modest eyes Not that
she beguiled me suh though the devil himself might have been
excused for mistakin her for the scarlet womanbut Im past the
time of life when a man wants a woman jest to set aroun an look
at I tell you a good workin pair of hands goes to my heart a
long ways sooner than the blackest eyes that ever oggled

Well my daughter Jinnie has been up thar sewin for a month
put in Tom Spade a big greasy man who looked as if he had
lived on cabbage from his infancy an she says that sech a
sight of lace she never laid eyes on Why her very stockins
have got lace let in em Jinnie says

Now thats what I call hardly decent remarked Sol as he spat
upon the dirty floor Thems the enticin kind of women that a
fool hovers near an a wise man fights shy of Lace in her
stockins Well did anybody ever

Shes got a pretty ankle you may be sho observed Matthew
Field a long wisp of a man who had married too early to repent
it too late an I must say if it kills me that I always had a
sharp eye for ankles

Its a pity you didnt look as far up as the hand returned Tom
Spade with boisterous mirth I have heard that Eliza lays hers
on right heavy

Thats so suh thats so admitted Matthew puffing smoke like
a shifting engine but thats the fault of the marriage service
an Ill stand to it at the Judgment Day yes suh in the very
presence of Providence who made it I tell you twill I led that
woman to the altar she was the meekestmouthed creetur that ever
wiggled away from a kiss Why when I stepped on her train jest
as I swung her up the aisle if you believe me all she said was
I hope you didnt hurt yo foot an bless my boots ten
minutes later comin out of church she whispered in my year
You whitelivered hulkin hound you get off my veil Well
well its sad how the ceremony can change a womans heart

That makes it safer always to choose a widow commented Sol
Now they do say that this is a fine weddin up at the Hall
but I have my doubts Them lace let in stockins aint to my
mind

Whats the rich young gentleman like inquired Tom Spade with
interest Jinnie says hes the kind of man that makes kissin
come naturalbut I cant say that that conveys much to the
father of a family

Oh hes the sort that looks as if God Almighty had put the
finishin touches an forgot to make the man replied Sol Hes
got a mustache that you would say went to bed every night in curl
papers

Christopher pushed back his chair and drained his glass standing
then with a curt nod to Tom Spade he went out into the road

It was the walk of a mile from the store to his house and as he
went on he fell to examining the tobacco which appeared to ripen
hour by hour in the warm moist season There was no danger of
frost as yet and though a little of Fletchers crop had already
been cut the others had left theirs to mature in the favourable
weather From a clear emerald the landscape had changed to a
yellowish green and the huge leaves had crinkled at the edges
like shirred silk Here and there palebrown splotches on a plant
showed that it had too quickly ripened or small perforations
revealed the destructive presence of a hidden tobacco worm

As Christopher neared the house the hounds greeted him with a
single bay and the cry brought Cynthia hastily out upon the
porch and along the little path At the gate she met him and
slipping her hand under his arm drew him across the road to the
rail fence that bordered the old field At sight of her tearless
pallor his everpresent fear shot up and without waiting for her
words he cried out quickly Is mother ill

No no she answered oh no but Christopher it is the next
worse thing

He thought for a breath Then she has found out

Its not that either she shook her head Oh Christopher
its Fletcher

Its Fletcher What in thunder have we to do with Fletcher

You remember the deed of trust on the placethe three hundred
dollars we borrowed when mother was sick Fletcher has bought it
from Tom Spade and he means to foreclose it in a week He has
advertised the farm at the crossroads

He paled with anger Why I saw Tom about it three days ago he
said striking the rotten fence rail until it broke and fell
apart he told me it could run on at the same interest

Its since then that Fletcher has bought it He meant it as a
surprise of course to drive us out whether or no but Sam
Murray came straight up to tell you

He stood thinking hard his eyes on the waving goldenrod in the
old field

Ill sell the horses he said at last

And starve Besides they wouldnt bring the money

Then well sell the furnitureevery last stick Well sell the
clothes from our backsIll sell myself into slavery before
Fletcher shall beat me now

Weve sold all weve got said Cynthia the old furniture is
too heavyall thats left nobody about here wants it

I tell you Ill find those three hundred dollars if I have to
steal them Id rather go to prison than have Fletcher get the
place

Then hed leave it in the end remarked Cynthia hopelessly
adding after a pause Ive thought it all out dear and we must
steal the moneywe must steal it from mother

From mother he echoed touched to the quick

You know her big diamond sobbed the woman the one in her
engagement ring that she never used to take off even at night
till her fingers got so thin

Oh I couldnt he protested

Theres no other way pursued Cynthia without noticing him
Surely it is better than having her turned out in her old
agesurely anything is better than that We can take the ring
tonight after she goes to bed and pry the diamond from the
setting it is held only by gold claws you know Then we will
put in it the piece of purple glass from Docias wedding
ringthe shape is the same and she will never find it out Oh
mother mother

I cant returned Christopher stubbornly it is like robbing
her and she so blind and helpless I cannot do it

Then I will said Cynthia quietly and turning from him she
walked rapidly to the house

Later that night when he had gone up to his little garret loft
she came to him with the two rings in her outstretched handthe
superb white diamond and the common purple setting in Docias
brass hoop

Lend me your knife she said kneeling beside the smoky oil
lamp and without a word he drew his claspknife from his pocket
opened the blade and held the handle toward her She took it
from him and then knelt motionless for an instant looking at the
diamond which shone like a star in her hollowed palm Presently
she stooped and kissed it and then taking the fine point of the
blade carefully pried the gold claws back from the imprisoned
stone

She has worn it for fifty years she said softly seeing the
jewel contract and give out a deeper flame to her misty eyes

It is robbery he protested

It is robbery for her sake she flashed out angrily

All the same it seems bitterly cruel

With deft fingers she removed the bit of purple glass from
Docias ring and inserted it between the gold claws which she
pressed securely down To the touch there is no difference she
said closing her eyes She will never know

Rising from her knees she gazed steadily at the loosened diamond
lying in her hand then wrapping it in cotton she placed it in
a little wooden box from a jeweller of fifty years ago You must
get up tomorrow and take it to town she went on Carry it to
Mr Withershe knows us There is no other way she added
hastily

There is no other way I know he repeated as he held out his
hand

And youll be back after sundown

Not until night I shall walk over from the crossroads

For a time they were both silent and he walking to the narrow
window looked out into the moist darkness The smell of the oil
lamp oppressed the atmosphere inside and the damp wind in his
face revived in a measure his lowered spirits He seemed suddenly
able to cope with lifeand with Fletcher

Far away there was a faint glimmer among the trees now shining
clear now almost lost in mist and he knew it to be a lighted
window at Blake Hall The thought of Marias lace stockings came
to him all at once and he was seized with a rage that was
ludicrously large for so small a cause Confused questions
whirled in his brain struggling for recognition I am here and
she is there and what is the meaning of it all I know in spite
of everything I might have loved her and yet I know still better
that it is not love but hate I now feel What is the difference
after all And why this eternal bother of possibilities He
turned presently and spoke

And you got this without her suspecting it

She was sleeping like a child and Lila was in the little bed in
her chamber Often she is restless disturbed by her dreams but
tonight she lies very quiet and she smiled once as if she were
so happy

And tomorrow she will wear the ring with its setting of purple
glass

She will never knowsee it fits perfectly I have fastened it
carefully After all what does it matter to herthe ring is
still the same and the value of it was for her in the
association Again he looked out of the window and the distant
glimmer gathered radiance and shone brightly among the trees I
am here and she is there and what is the meaning of it all



CHAPTER IV A Gallant Deed that Leads to Evil

Two days later Christopher met Fletcher in the little room behind
the store and paid down the three hundred dollars in the presence
of Sam Murray Several loungers who had been seasoning their
drinks with leisurely stories hastily drained their glasses and
withdrew at Fletchers entrance and when the three men came
together to settle the affair of the mortgage they were alone in
the presence of the tobaccostained walls the square pine table
with its dirty glasses and the bills of notice posted beside the
door Among them Christopher had seen the public advertisement of
his farma rambling statement in large letters signifying that
the place would be sold for debt on Monday the twentyfifth of
September at twelve oclock I want the money right flat down
Are you sure youve got it were Fletchers first words after
his start of angry surprise For answer Christopher drew the roll
of bills from his pocket and counted them out upon the table
Here it is he said and I am done with you for good and
allwith you and your rascally cheating ways Come come
lets go easy warned Sam Murray a fat welltodo farmer who
was accustomed to act the part of a lawyer in small transactions
Fletcher flushed purple and threw off his rage in a sneering
guffaw Now that sounds well from him doesnt it he inquired
when everybody knows he hasnt a beggarly stitch on earth but
that strip of land he thinks so much of And whose fault is
that Bill Fletcher demanded the young man throwing the last
note down Oh well I dont bear you any grudge responded
Fletcher with an abrupt assumption of goodnatured tolerance
and to show Im a wellmeaning man in spite of abuse Ill let
the debt run on two years longer at the same interest if you
choose

Christopher laughed shortly Thats all right Sam he said
without replying directly to the offer I owe him too much
already to hope to pay it back in a single lifetime Well
youre a cantankerous hardheaded fool thats all Ive got to
say burst out Fletcher swallowing hard and the sooner you get
to the poorhouse along your own road the better itll be for the
rest of us You may be sure Ill take care not to go along
yours Ill have honest men about me at any rate Then its
more than youve got a right to expect

Christopher grew pale to the lips What do you mean you
scoundrel he cried taking a single step forward Come come
lets go easy said Sam Murray persuasively rising from his
chair at the table Now that this little business is all settled
theres no need for another word I havent much opinion of words
myself anyhow Theyre apt to set fire to a dry tongue thats
what I say What do you mean repeated Christopher without
swerving from his steady gaze Tom Spade glanced in at the open
door and catching Fletchers eye hurriedly retreated A small
boy with a greasy face came in and gathered up the glasses with a
clanking noise What do you mean you coward demanded
Christopher for the third time He had not moved an inch from the
position he had first assumed but the circle about his mouth
showed blue against the sunburn on his face Fletcher raised his
hand and spoke suddenly with a snort Oh you neednt kick so
about swallowing it he said Everybody knows that your
grandfather never paid a debt he owed and your father was mighty
little better He was only saved from becoming a thief by being a
drunkard He choked over the last word for Christopher with an
easy almost leisurely movement had struck him full in the
mouth The young mans arm was raised again but before it fell
Sam Murray caught it back I say Tom theres the devil to pay
here he shouted and Tom Spade rushed hurriedly through the
doorway Now now thatll never do Mr Christopher he
reasoned with a deference he would never have wasted upon
Fletcher Why hes old enough to be yo pa twice over

A white fleck was on Fletchers beard and as he wiped it away he
spoke huskily Its a clear case of assault and Ill have the
law on him he said Sam Murray you saw him hit me square in
the face

Bless your life I wasnt looking suh responded Sam
pleasantly I miss a lot in this life by always happening to
look the other way

Ill have the law on you cried Fletcher again shaking back
his heavy eyebrows

Youre welcome to have every skulking hound in the county on
me Christopher replied loosening Sam Murrays restraining
grasp If I can settle you I reckon I can settle them but the
day you open your lying mouth to me again Ill shoot you down as
I would a mad dogand wash my hands clean afterward

He looked round for his harvest hat picked it up from the floor
where it had fallen and walked slowly out of the room

In the broad noon outside he staggered an instant dazzled by the
glare

Had a drop too much aint you Mr Christopher a voice
inquired at his side and looking down he saw Sol Peterkin
sitting on a big wooden box just outside the store

Not too much to mind my own business was his curt reply

Oh no harms meant suh an I hope nones taken responded
the little man goodnaturedly I saw you walk kinder crooked
that was all anit came to me that you might be needin an arm
toward home Young gentlemen will be gentlemen thats the truth
suh an in my day I reckon Ive steadied the legs of mo young
beaux than you could count on your ten fingers Good Lord when
it comes to thinkin of those Christmas Eve frolics that we had
befo the war Why they use to say that you couldnt get to the
Hall unless you swam your way through apple toddy Jest to think
an here Ive been settin an countin the bundles goin up
thar now

Im looking for a box Tom said a clear voice at Christophers
back a big paper hatbox that ought to have come by express

He turned quickly and saw Maria Fletcher in a little cart in the
road with a strange young man holding the reins As Christopher
swung round she nodded pleasantly but with a cool stare he
passed down the steps and out into the road carrying with him a
distasteful impression of the strange young man Yet from that
first hurried glimpse he had brought away only the picture of a
brown mustache

By George Id like to see that fellow in the prize ring he
heard the stranger remark as he went by Do they have knockouts
around here I wonder

Oh I dare say hed oblige you with one if you took the trouble
to tread on his preserves was the girls laughing rejoinder

A massive repulsion swept over Christopher pervading his entire
bodyrepulsion that was but a recoil from his exhausted rage In
this new emotion there were both weariness and selfpity and to
his mental vision there showed clearly with an impersonal
detachment his own figure in relation to the scenes among which
he moved That is I yonder he might have said had he been able
to disentangle thought from sensation plodding along there
through the red mud in the road Look at the coarse clothes
smelling of axlegrease the hands knotted by toil and stained
with tobacco juice the face soiled with sweat and clay That is
I who was born with the love of ease and the weakness to
temptation in my blood with the love too of delicate food of
rare wines and of beautiful women Once I craved these things
now the thought of them troubles me no longer for I work in the
sun all day and go home to enjoy my coarse food Is it because I
have been broken to this life as a young horse is broken to the
plough or have all the desires I have known been swallowed up in
a single hatreda hatred as jealous and as strong as love

It was his nightly habit lying upon his narrow bed in the little
loft to yield some moments before sleeping to his idle dreams of
vengeanceto plan exquisite punishments and impossible
retaliations In imagination he had so often seen Fletcher drop
dead before him had so often struck the man down with his own
hand that there were hours when he almost believed the deed to
have been donewhen something like madness gripped him and his
hallucinations took the shape and colour of life itself At such
times he was conscious of the exhilaration that comes in the
instants of swift action when events move quickly and one rises
beyond the ordinary level of experience When the real moment
camethe supreme chancehe wondered if he would meet it as
triumphantly as he met his dreams Now plodding along the rocky
road he went over again all the old schemes for the great
revenge

The small cart whirled past him scattering dried mud drops in
his face and he caught the sound of bright girlish laughter
Looking after it he saw the flutter of cherrycoloured ribbons
coiling outward in the wind and he remembered watching the gay
streamers that the only woman he had ever kissed was eating
cherries at the moment Trivial as the recollection was it
started other associations and he followed the escaping memory
of that boyish romance blithe and shortlived which was killed
at last by a single yielded kiss At sixteen it had seemed to him
that when he caught the girl of the cherries in his arms he
should hold veritable happiness and yet afterward there was only
a great heaviness and something of the repulsion that he felt
today Happiness was not to be found on a womans lips he had
learned this in his boyhood and then even as the knowledge
returned to him he found himself savagely regretting that he had
not kissed Maria Fletcher the day he found her on his landa
kiss of anger not of love which she would have loathed all her
lifeand have remembered To have her utterly forget himpass
on serenely into her marriage hardly remembering that he hated
herthis was the bitterest thing he had to face but with the
brutal wish he softened in recalling the tremor of her lip as
she turned awaythe indignant quiver of her eyelashes Again
came the thought I know in spite of everything I might have
loved her and yet I know still better that it is not love but
hate I now feel Her fragrance floating in the sunshine filled
his nostrils and involuntarily he glanced over his shoulder
half expecting to find a dropped handkerchief in the road None
was thereonly a scattered swarm of butterflies drifting like
yellow roseleaves on the wind

Upon reaching the house he found that his mother had asked for
him and running hastily up to change his clothes he came down
and bent over the upright Elizabethan chair I have been
worrying a good deal about you my son she said with a
sprightly gesture in which the piece of purple glass struck the
dominant note Are you quite sure that you are feeling perfectly
well No palpitations of the heart when you go upstairs and no
particular heaviness after meals I dreamed about you all night
long and though theres not a woman in the world freer from
superstition I cant help feeling uneasy Taking her hand he
gently caressed the slender fingers Why Im a regular ox
mother he returned laughing my muscle is like iron and I
assure you Im ready for my meals day or night Theres no use
worrying about me so youd as well give it up I cant
understand it I really cant protested Mrs Blake still
unconvinced I am an old woman you know and I am anxious to
have you settled in life before I diebut there seems to be a
most extraordinary humour in the family with regard to marriage
Im sure your poor father would turn in his grave at the very
idea of his having no grandchildren to come after him Well
theres time yet mother give us breathing space Theres not
time in my day Christopher for I am very old and half dead as
it isbut it does seem hard that I am never to be present at the
marriage of a child As for Cynthia she is out of the question
of course which is a great pity I have very little patience
with an unmarried womanno not if she were Queen Elizabeth
herself though I do know that they are sometimes found very
useful in the dairy or the spinningroom As for an old bachelor
I have never seen the spot on earthand Ive lived to a great
agewhere he wasnt an encumbrance They really ought to be
taught some useful occupation such as skimming milk or carding
wool I hardly think either of those pursuits would be to my
taste protested Christopher but I give you leave to try your
hand on Uncle Tucker Tucker has been a hero my son rejoined
the old lady in a stately voice and the privilege of having
once been a hero is that nobody expects you to exert yourself
again A man who has taken the enemys guns singlehanded or
figured prominently in a society scandal is comfortably settled
in his position and may slouch pleasantly for the remainder of
his life But for an ordinary gentleman it is quite different
and as we are not likely to have another war you really ought to
marry You are preparing to go through life too peacefully my
son Good Lord exclaimed Christopher are you hankering
after squabbles Well you shant drag me into them at any cost
Theres Uncle Tucker to your hand as I said before Im sure
Tucker might have married several times had he cared about it
replied Mrs Blake reprovingly Miss Matoaca Bolling always had
a sentiment for him I am certain and even after his misfortune
she went so far as to present him with a most elaborate slipper
of red velvet ornamented with steel beads I remember well her
consulting me as to whether it would be better to seem
unsympathetic and give him two or to appear indelicate and offer
him one I suggested that she should make both for the same
foot which I believe she finally decided to do Well
well this is all very interesting mother said Christopher
rising from his seat but Ive promised old Jacob Weatherby to
pass my word on his tobacco On the way down however Ill cast
my eyes about for a wife Between here and the Weatherbys
farm Why Christopher Thats all right but unless you expect
me to pick up one on the roadside I dont see how well manage
Ill do anything to oblige you you know even marry if youll
find me a good sensible woman The old ladys eyelids dropped
over her piercing black eyes which seemed always to regard some
faroff ecstatic vision Three small furrows ran straight up and
down her forehead and she lifted one delicate white hand to rub
them out I dont like joking on so serious a subject my son
she said Im sure Providence expects every man to do his duty
and to remain unmarried seems like putting ones personal
inclination before the intentions of the Creator Your
grandfather Corbin used to say he had so high an opinion of
marriage that if his fourth wife and she was very sicklywere
to die at once hed marry his fifth within the year I remember
that Bishop Deane remarked it was one of the most beautiful
tributes ever paid the marriage stateespecially as it was no
idle boast for as it happened his wife died shortly afterward
and he married Miss Polly Blair before six months were up What
a precious old fool he was laughed the young man as he reached
the door passing out with a horrified What Christopher Your
own grandfather ringing in his ears In the yard he found
Cynthia drawing water at the well and he took the heavy bucket
from her and carried it into the kitchen Youd better change
your clothes she remarked eyeing him narrowly if youre
going
back to the field But Im not going back the axe handle has
broken again and Ill have to borrow Jim Weatherbys Theres no
use trying to mend that old handle any more Itll have to lie
over till after tobacco cutting when I can make a new one Oh
you might as well keep Jims altogether returned Cynthia
irritably loath to receive favours from her neighbours The
first thing we know he will be running this entire place I
reckon hed make a much better job of it replied Christopher
as he swung out into the road On the whitewashed porch of the
Weatherbys house he found old Jacoba hale clearly old man
with cheeks like frosted winter applesgazing thoughtfully over
his fine field of tobacco which had grown almost to his
threshold The weathers going to have a big drop tonight he
said reflectively I smell it on the wind Lord Lord I reckon
Id better begin on that thar tobaccy about sunupand yet
another day or so of sun and September dew would sweeten it
considerble How about yours Mr Christopher Ill cut my
ripest plants tomorrow answered Christopher sniffing the air
A big drops coming sure enough but I dont scent frost as
yetthe pines dont smell that way They discussed the tobacco
for a timethe rosy genial old man whom age had mellowed
without souringlistening with a touching deference to his
visitors casual words and when at last Christopher with the
axe on his shoulder started leisurely homeward the drop was
already beginning and the wind blew cool and crisp across the
misty fields beyond which a round red sun was slowly setting
Level vast and dark the tobacco swept clear to the horizon
Between Weatherbys and the little store there was an abrupt bend
in the road where it shot aside from a steep descent in the
ground and Christopher had reached this point when he saw
suddenly ahead of him a farm wagon driven forward at a reckless
pace As it neared him he heard the wheels thunder on the rocky
bed of the road and saw that the drivers seat was vacant the
man evidently having been thrown some distance back The
horsesa young pair he had never seen beforeheld the bits in
their mouths and it was with a hopelessness of checking their
terrible speed that he stepped out of the road to give them room
The next instant he saw that they were making straight for the
declivity from which the road shot back seeing in the same
breath that the driver of the wagon not falling clear had
entangled himself in the long reins and was being dragged rapidly
beneath the wheels Tossing his axe aside he sprang instantly at
the horses heads hanging with his whole powerful weight upon
their mouths Life or death was nothing to him at the moment and
he seemed to have only an impersonal interest in the multiplied
sensations What followed was a sense of incalculable swiftness
a near glimpse of blue sky the falling of stars around him in
the road and after these things a great darkness

When he came to himself he was lying in a patch of short grass
with a little knot of men about him among whom he recognised Jim
Weatherby I brought them in didnt I he asked struggling
up and then he saw that his coat sleeves were rent from the
armholes leaving his arms bare beneath his torn blue shirt
Cynthias warning returned to him and he laughed shortly Well
I reckon you could bring the devil in if you put all your grip on
him was Jims reply as it is youre pretty sore aint you
Oh rather but I wish I hadnt spoiled my coat He was still
thinking of Cynthia God alive man its a mercy you didnt
spoil your life Why another second and the horses would have
been over that bank yonder with you and young Fletcher under the
wagon

Christopher rose slowly from the ground and stood erect

With meand who under the wagonand who he asked in a
throaty voice

Jim Weatherby whistled Why to think you didnt know all
along he exclaimed It was Fletchers boy he made Zebbadee
let him take the reins Fletcher saw it all and he was clean mad
when he got hereit took three men to hold him He thinks more
of that boy than he does of his own soul Whats the matter man
are you hurt

Christopher had gone dead white and the blue circle came out
slowly around his mouth And I saved him he gasped I saved
him Isnt there some mistake Maybe hes dead anyway

Bless you no responded Jim a trifle disconcerted The
doctors here and he says its a case of a broken leg instead of
a broken neck thats all

Looking about him Christopher saw that there was another group
of men at a little distance gathered around something that lay
still and straight on the grass The sound of a hoarse groan
reached him suddenlyan inarticulate cry of distressand he
felt with a savage joy that it was from Fletcher He looked down
drawing together his tattered sleeves For a time he was silent
and when he spoke it was with a sneering laugh

Well Ive been a fool thats all was what he said



CHAPTER V The Glimpse of a Bride

The next morning he awoke with stiffened limbs and confusion in
his head and for a time he lay idly looking at his little
windowpanes beyond which the dawn hung like a curtain Then as
a long finger of sunlight pointed through the glass he rose with
an effort and dressing himself hastily went downstairs to
breakfast Here he found that Zebbadee Blake who had promised to
help him cut his crop had not yet appeared owing probably to
the excitement of Fletchers runaway The mans absence annoyed
him at first and then as the day broke clear and cold he
succumbed to his ever present fear of frost and taking his
pruningknife from the kitchen mantelpiece went out alone to
begin work on his ripest plants

The sun had already tempered the morning chill in the air and
the slanting beams stretched over the tobacco which as the dew
dried showed a vivid green but faintly tinged with yellowa
colour that even in the sparkling sunlight appeared always
slightly shadowed To attempt alone the cutting of his crop
small as it was seemed with his stiffened limbs a particularly
trying task and for a moment he stood gazing wearily across the
field Presently with a deliberate movement as if he were
stooping to shoulder a fresh burden he slit the first ripe stalk
from its flaunting top to within a handsbreadth of the ground
then cutting it half through near the roots he let it fall to
one side where it hung slowly wilting on the earth Gradually
as he applied himself to the work the old zest of healthful
labour returned to him and he passed buoyantly through the
narrow aisle leaving a devastated furrow on either side It was
a cheerful picture he presented when Tucker dragging himself
heavily from the house came to the ragged edge of the field and
sat down on an old mossgrown stump Wheres Zebbadee
Christopher  He didnt turn up It was that affair of the
accident probably Fletcher berated him I reckon So youve
got to cut it all yourself Well its a firstrate cropthe
very primings ought to be as good as some top leaves The
crops
all right responded Christopher as his knife passed with a
ripping noise down the juicy stalk You know I made a fool of
myself yesterday Uncle Tucker he said suddenly drawing back
when the plant fell slowly across the furrow and Im so stiff
in the joints this morning I can hardly move I met one of
Fletchers farm wagons running away with his boy dragged by the
reins andI stopped it Tucker turned his mild blue eyes upon
him Since the news of Appomattox nothing had surprised him and
he was not surprised nowhe was merely interested You couldnt
have helped it I suspect he remarked

I didnt know whose it was you see answered Christopher the
horses were new Youd have done it anyway I reckon At such
moments its a mans mettle that counts you know and not his
emotions You might have hated Fletcher ten times worse but
youd have risked your life to stop the horses all the same
because after all what a man is is something different from how
he feels about things Its in your blood to dare everything
whenever a chance offers as it was in your fathers before you
Why Ive seen him stop on the way to a ball pull off his coat
and go up a burning ladder to save a womans pet canary and
then when the crowd hurrahed him Ive laughed because I knew he
deserved nothing of the kind With him it wasnt courage so much
as his inborn love of violent actionit cleared his head he
used to say Christopher stopped cutting straightened himself
and held his knife loosely in his hand Thats about it I
reckon he returned I know Im not a bit of a heroif Id
been in your place Id have shown up long ago for a skulking
cowardbut its the excitement of the moment that I like Why
theres nothing in life Id enjoy so much as knocking Fletcher
downits one of the things I look forward to that makes it all
worth while Tucker laughed softly It was a peculiarity of his
never to disapprove Thats a good savage instinct he said
with a humorous tremor of his nostrils and its a saying of
mine you know that a man is never reallycivilised until he
has turned fifty Were all born mighty near to the wolf and
mighty far from the dog and it takes a good many years to coax
the wild beast to lie quiet by the fireside Its the struggle
that the Lord wants I reckon and anyhow He makes it easier for
us as the years go on When a man gets along past his fiftieth
year he begins to understand that there are few things worth
bothering about and the sins of his fellow mortals are not among
em  Bless my soul exclaimed Christopher in disgust rapping
his palm smartly with the flat blade of his knife Do you mean
to tell me youve actually gone and forgiven Bill Fletcher
Well I wouldnt go so far as to water the grass on his grave
answered Tucker still smiling but Ive not the slightest
objection to his eating sleeping and moving on the surface of
the earth Theres room enough for us both even in this little
county and so long as he keeps out of my sight as far as I am
concerned he absolutely doesnt exist I never think of him
except when you happen to call his name If a man steals my
money thats his affair I cant afford to let him steal my
peace of mind as well With a groan Christopher went back to his
work It may be sense youre talking he observed but it
sounds to me like pure craziness Its just as well either way
I reckon that Im not in your place and you in minefor if that
were so Fletcher would most likely go scot free Tucker rose
unsteadily from the stump Why if we stood in each others
boots he said with a gentle chuckle or to be exact if I
stood in your two boots and you in my one as sure as fate youd
be thinking my way and I yours Well I wish I could help you
but as I cant Ill be moving slowly back

He shuffled off on his crutches painfully swinging himself a
step at a time and Christopher after a moments puzzled stare
at his pathetic figure returned diligently to his work

His passage along the green aisle was very slow and when at last
he reached the extreme end by the little beaten path and felled
the last stalk on his left side he straightened himself for a
moments rest and stood bareheaded gazing over the broad
field which looked as if a windstorm had blown in an even line
along the edge scattering the outside plants upon the ground
The thought of his work engrossed him at the instant and it was
with something of a start that he became conscious presently of
Maria Fletchers voice at his back Wheeling about dizzily he
found her leaning on the old rail fence regarding him with
shining eyes in which the tears seemed hardly dried

I have just left Will she said the doctor has set his leg
and he is sleeping It was my last chanceI am going away
tomorrowand I wanted to tell youI wanted so to tell you how
grateful we feel

The knife dropped from his hand and he came slowly along the
little path to the fence

I fear youve got an entirely wrong idea about me he answered
It was nothing in the world to make a fuss overand I swear to
you if it were the last word I ever spokeI did not know it was
your brother

As if that mattered she exclaimed and he remembered vaguely
that he had heard her use the words before You risked your life
to save his life we know that Grandpa saw it alland the
horses dragged you too You would have been killed if the others
hadnt run up when they did And you tell meas if that made it
any the less brave that you didnt know it was Will

I didnt he repeated stubbornly I didnt

Well he does  she responded smiling and he wants to thank
you himself when he is well enough

If you wish to do me a kindness for heavens sake tell him not
to he said irritably I hate all such foolishness it makes me
out a hypocrite

I knew youd hate it I told them so tranquilly responded the
girl Aunt Saidie wanted to rush right over last night but I
wouldnt let her All brave men dislike to have a fuss made over
them I know

Good Lord ejaculated Christopher and stopped short
impatiently desisting before the admiration illumining her eyes
From her former disdain he had evidently risen to a height in
her regard that was romantic in its ardour It was in vain that
he told himself he cared for one emotion as little as for the
otherin spite of his words the innocent fervour in her face
swept over the barrier of his sullen pride

So you are going away tomorrow he said at last and for
good

For good yes I go abroad very unexpectedly for perhaps five
years My things arent half ready but business is of more
importance than a womans clothes

Will you be alone

Oh no

Who goes with you he insisted bluntly

As she reddened he watched the colour spread slowly to her
throat and ear

I am to be married you know she answered with her accustomed
composure of tone

His lack of gallantry was churlish

To that dummy with the brown mustache he inquired

A little hysterical laugh broke from her and she made a hopeless
gesture of reproof Your manners are really elementary she
remarked adding immediately I assure you he isnt in the least
a dummyhe is considered a most delightful talker

He swept the jest impatiently aside

Why do you do it he demanded

Do what

You know what I mean Why do you marry him

Again she bit back a laugh It was all very primitive very
savage she told herself it was above all different from any
of the life that she had known and yet in a mysterious way it
was familiar as if the unrestrained emotion in his voice stirred
some racial memory within her brain

Why do I marry him She drew a step away looking at sky and
field Why do I marry him She hesitated slightly Oh for
many reasons and all good onesbut most of all because I love
him

You do not love him

I beg your pardon but I do

For the first time in her life as her eyes swept over the
landscape she was conscious of a peculiar charm in the wildness
of the country in the absence of all civilising influencesin
the open sky the red road the luxuriant tobacco the coarse
sprays of yarrow blooming against the fence in the homely tasks
drawing one close to the soil and the harvesting of the ripened
crops the milking of the mildeyed cows and in the long still
days followed by the long still nights

Their eyes met and for a time both were silent She felt again
the old vague trouble at his presence the appeal of the rustic
tradition the rustic temperament of all the multiplied
inheritances of the centuries which her education had not
utterly extinguished

Well I hope youll live to regret it he said suddenly with
bitter passion

The words startled her and she caught her breath with a tremor

What an awful wish she exclaimed lightly

Its an honest one

Im not sure I shouldnt prefer a little polite lying

You wont get it from me I hope youll live to regret it Why
shouldnt I

Oh you might at least be decently human If you hadnt been so
brave yesterday I might almost think you a savage today

I didnt do that on purpose I told you he returned angrily

You cant make me believe thatits no use trying

I shant trythough its the gospel truthand youll find it
out some day

When

Oh when the time comes thats all

You speak in riddles she said and I always hated guessing
Then she held out her hand with a pleasant conventional smile
I am grateful to you in spite of everything she said and now
goodby

His arms hung at his side No I wont shake hands he
answered Whats the use

As you pleaseonly its the usual thing at parting

All the same I wont do it he said stubbornly My hands are
not clean He held them out soiled with earth and the stains
from the tobacco

For an instant her eyes dwelt upon him very kindly

Oh I shant mind the traces of honest toil she said but as
he still hung back she gave a friendly nod and went quickly
homeward along the road As her figure vanished among the trees
a great bitterness oppressed him and picking up his knife he
went back doggedly to his work

In the kitchen when he returned to dinner some hours later he
found Cynthia squinting heavily over the torn coat

I must say you ruined this yesterday she remarked looking up
from her needle and if youd listened to me you could have
stopped those horses just as well in your old jean clothes I had
a feeling that something was going to happen when I saw you with
this on

I dont doubt it he responded woefully eyeing the garment
spread on her knees and I may as well admit right now that I
made a mess of the whole thing To think of my wasting the only
decent suit I had on a Fletcherafter saving up a year to buy
it too

Cynthia twitched the coat inside out and placed a square patch
over the ragged edges of the rent I suppose I ought to be
thankful you saved the boys life she observed but I cant
say that I feel particularly jubilant when I look at these
armholes Of course when I first heard of it the coat seemed a
mere trifle but when I come to the mending I begin to wish youd
been heroic in your everyday clothes Therell have to be a patch
right here but I dont reckon it will show much Do you mind

Id rather wear a mustard plaster than a patch any time he
replied gravely but as long as theres no help for it lay them
ondont slight the job a bit because of my feelings I can
stand pretty well having my jean clothes darned and mended but I
do object to dressing up on Sundays in a bedquilt

Well youll have to thats all was Cynthias reassuring
rejoinder Its the price you pay for being a hero when you
cant afford it



CHAPTER VI Shows Fletcher in a New Light

Responding to a muchdistracted telegram from Fletcher Carraway
arrived at the Hall early on the morning of Marias marriage to
arrange for the transfer to the girl of her smaller share in her
grandfathers wealth In the reaction following the hysterical
excitement over the accident Fletcher had grown doubly
solicitous about the future of the boyfeeling apparently that
the value of his heir was increased by his having so nearly lost
him When Carraway found him he was bustling noisily about the
sickroom walking on tiptoe with a tramp that shook the floor
while Will lay gazing wearily at the sunlight which filtered
through the bright green shutters Somewhere in the house a
canary was trilling joyously and the cheerful sound lent a
pleasant animation to the otherwise depressing atmosphere On his
way upstairs Carraway had met Maria running from the boys room
with her hair loose upon her shoulders and she had stopped long
enough to show a smiling face on the subject of her marriage
There were to be only Fletcher Miss Saidie and himself as
witnesses he gathered Wyndhams parents having held somewhat
aloof from the connectionand within three hours at the most it
would be over and the bridal pair beginning their long journey
Looking down from the next landing he had further assurance of
the sincerity of Marias smile when he saw the lovers meet and
embrace within the shadow of the staircase and the sight stirred
within his heart something of that wistful pity with which those
who have learned how little emotion counts in life watch the
first exuberance of young passion A bright beginning whatever be
the ending he thought a little sadly as he turned the handle of
the sickroom door

The boys fever had risen and he tossed his arms restlessly upon
the counterpane Stand out of my sunshine grandpa he said
fretfully as the lawyer sat down by his bedside

Fletcher shuffled hastily from before the window and it struck
Carraway almost ludicrously that in all the surroundings in which
he had ever seen him the man had never appeared so hopelessly out
of placenot even when he had watched him at prayer one Sunday
in the little country church

There youre in it again complained the boy in his peevish
tones

Fletcher lifted a cup from the table and brought it over to the
bed

Maybe youd like a sip of this beef tea now he suggested
persuasively Its most time for your medicine you know so
jest a little taste of this beforehand

I dont like it grandpa its too salt

Thar now thats jest like Saidie blurted Fletcher angrily
Saidie youve gone and made his beef tea too salt

Miss Saidie appeared instantly at the door of the adjoining room
and without seeking to diminish the importance of her offense
mildly offered to prepare a fresh bowl of the broth

Im packing Marias clothes now she said but Ill be through
in a jiffy and then Ill make the soup Ive jest fixed up the
parlour for the marriage Maria insists on having a footstool to
kneel onshe aint satisfied with jest standing with jined hands
before the preacher like her pa and ma did before she was born

Well drat Marias whims retorted Fletcher impatiently they
can wait I reckon and Wills got to have his tea so youd
better fetch it

But I dont want it grandpa protested the boy flushed and
troubled You worry me so thats all Please stop fooling with
those curtains I like the sunshine

A nap is what he needs I suspect observed Carraway touched
in spite of himself by the lumbering misery of the man

Ah thats it agreed Fletcher catching readily at the

suggestion You jest turn right over and take yo nap and when
you wake up well Ill give you anything you want Here swallow
this stuff down quick and youll sleep easy

He brought the medicine glass to the bedside and slipping his
great hairy hand under the pillow gently raised the boys head

I reckon youd like a brand new saddle when you git up he
remarked in a coaxing voice

Id rather have a squirrel gun grandpa I want to go hunting
Fletchers face clouded

Im afraid youd git shot sonny

With his lips to the glass Will paused to haggle over the price
of his obedience

But I want it he insisted and I want a pack of hounds too
to chase rabbits

Bless my boots You aint going to bring any driveling beasts on
the place air you

Yes I am grandpa I wont swallow this unless you say I may

Oh you hurry up and git well and then well seewell see
was Fletchers answer Gulp this stuff right down now and turn
over

The boy still hesitated

Then I may have the hounds he said that new litter of
puppies Tom Spade has and Ill get Christopher Blake to train
em for me

The pillow shook under his head and as he opened his mouth to
drink a few drops of the liquid spilled upon the bedclothes

I reckon Zebbadees a better man for hounds suggested
Fletcher setting down the glass

Oh Zebbadees arent worth a centthey cant tell a rabbit
from a wateringpot I want Christopher Blake to train em and I
want to see him about it today Tell him to come grandpa

I cant sonnyI cant you git your hounds and well find a
better man Why thars Jim Weatherby hell do first rate

His dogs are setters fretted Will I dont want him I want
Christopher Blakehe saved my life you know

So he did so he did admitted Fletcher and he shant be a
loser by that suh he added turning to Carraway When you go
over thar you can carry my check along for five hundred
dollars

The lawyer smiled Oh Ill take it he answered and Ill
very likely bring it back

The boy looked at Carraway You tell him to come sir he
pleaded His eyes were so like Fletcherssmall sparkling
changing from blue to brownthat the lawyers glance lingered
upon the others features seeking some resemblance in them
also To his surprise he found absolutely none the high
blueveined forehead beneath the chestnut hair the straight
delicate nose the sensitive almost effeminate curve of the
mouth must have descended from the worthless drab whom he had
beheld in the severe white light of Fletchers scorn For the
first time it occurred to Carraway that the illumination had been
too intense

Ill tell him certainly he said quietly after a moment but
I dont promise that hell come you understand

Oh I wont thank him cried the boy eagerly It isnt for
that I want himtell him so Maria says he hates a fuss

Ill deliver your message word for word responded the lawyer
Not only that Ill add my own persuasion to it though I fear I
have little influence with your neighbour

Tell him I beg him to come insisted the boy and the urgent
voice remained with Carraway throughout the day

It was not until the afternoon however when he had tossed his
farewell handful of rice at the departing carriage and met
Marias last disturbed look at the Hall that he found time to
carry Wills request and Fletchers check to Christopher Blake
The girl had shown her single trace of emotion over the boys
pillow where she had shed a few furtive tears and the thought
of this was with Carraway as he walked meditatively along the red
clay road down the long curves of which he saw the carriage
rolling leisurely ahead of him As a bride Maria puzzled him no
less than she had done at their first meeting and the riddle of
her personality he felt to be still hopelessly unsolved Was it
merely repression of manner that annoyed him in her he
questioned or was it as he had once believed the simple lack
of emotional power Her studied speech her conventional
courtesy seemed to confirm the first impression she had made
then her dark troubled gaze and the sullen droop of her mouth
returned to give the lie to what he could but feel to be a
possible misjudgment In the end he concluded wisely enough
that like the most of us she was probably but plastic matter
for the mark of circumstancethat her development would be
after all according to the events she was called upon to face
The possibility that Destiny which is temperament should have
already selected her as one of those who come into their
spiritual heritage only through defeat did not enter into the
halfhumorous consideration with which he now regarded her

Turning presently into the sunken road by the icepond he came
in a little while to the overgrown fence surrounding the Blake
farm In the tobacco field beyond the garden he saw Christophers
blueclad figure rising from a blur of green and following the
ragged path amid the yarrow he joined the young man where he
stood at work

As the lawyer reached his side Christopher glanced up
indifferently to give a nod of welcome His crop had all been
cut and be was now engaged in hanging the wilting plants from
long rails supported by forked poles At his feet there were
little green piles of tobacco and around him from the sunbaked
earth rose a headless army of bruised and bleeding stubble

So thriftless were the antiquated methods he followed that the
lawyer as he watched him could barely repress a smile Two
hundred years ago the same crop was probably raised cut and
cured on the same soil in the same careless and primitive
fashion Beneath all the seeming indifference to success or
failure Carraway discerned something of that blind reliance upon
chance which is apt to be the religious expression of a rural and
isolated people

Yes Ill leave it out awhile I reckon unless the weather
changes replied Christopher in answer to the lawyers inquiry

Well it promises fair enough returned Carraway pleasantly
They tell me by the way that the yellow suncured leaf is
coming into favour in the market You dont try that eh

Christopher shook his head and kneeling on the ground
carelessly sorted his pile of plants I learned to cure it
indoors he answered and I reckon Ill keep to the old way The
dark leaf is what the people about here likeit makes the
sweeter chew they think As for me I hate the very smell of
it Thats odd and Ill wager youre the only man in the
county who neither smokes nor chews Oh I handle it you see
The smell and the stain of it are well soaked in I sometimes
wonder if all the water in the river of Jordan could wash away
the blood of the tobacco worm With a laugh in which there was
more bitterness than mirth he stretched out his big bronzed
hands and Carraway saw that the nails and fingertips were dyed
bright green It does leave its mark observed the lawyer and
felt instantly that the speech was inane Christopher went on
quietly with his work gathering up the plants and hanging the
slit stalks over the long poles while the peculiar heavy odour
of the freshly cut crop floated unpleasantly about them For a
time Carraway watched him in silence his eyes dwelling soberly
upon the stalwart figure In spite of himself the mere beauty of
outline touched him with a feeling of sadness and when he spoke
at last it was in a lowered tone You have perhaps surmised
that my call is not entirely one of pleasure he began
awkwardly that I am above all the bearer of a message from
Mr Fletcher From Fletcher repeated Christopher coolly
Well I never heard a message of his yet that wasnt better left
undelivered I am sure I am correct in saying Carraway went
on steadily and not without definite purpose that he hopes you
will be generous enough to let bygones be bygones Christopher
nodded He feels of course pursued the lawyer that his
obligation to you is greater than he can hope to repay Indeed I
think if you knew the true state of the case your judgment of him
would be softened The boywho so nearly lost his life is the
one human being whom Fletcher loves better than himselfbetter
than his own soul I had almost said

Christopher looked up attentively Whod have thought it he
muttered beneath his breath Judging that he had at last made a
beginning at the plastering over of old scars Carraway went on
as if the other had not spoken So jealous is his affection in
this instance that I believe his granddaughters marriage is
something of a relief to him He is positively impatient of any
influence over the boy except his ownand that I fear is
hardly for good Picking up a clod of earth Christopher
crumbled it slowly to dust So the little chap comes in for all
this does he he asked as his gaze swept over the wide fields
in the distance He comes in for all that is mine by right and
Fletchers intention is I dare say that hell reflect honour
upon the theft That hell reflect honour upon the nameyes
It is the ambition of his grandfather I believe that the lad
should grow up to be respected in the countyto stand for
something more than he himself has done Well hell hardly
stand for more of a rascal remarked Christopher quietly and
then as his eyes rested on the landscape he appeared to follow
moodily some suggestion which had half escaped him Then the way
to touch the man is through the boy I presume he said
abruptly

Arrested by the words the lawyer looked down quickly but the
other still kneeling upon the ground was fingering a plant he
had just picked up Fine leaves eh was the remark that met
Carraways sudden start

To touch him yes replied the lawyer thoughtfully Whatever
heart he has is given to his grandson and when you saved the
lads life the other day you placed Fletcher in your debt for
good Of his gratitude I am absolutely sure and as a slight
expression of it he asked me to hand you this

He drew the check from his pocket and leaning over held it out
to Christopher To his surprise the young man took it from him
but the next moment he had torn it roughly in two and handed it
back again So you may as well return it to him he said and
rising slowly from the ground he stood pushing the loose plants
together with his foot

I feared as much observed Carraway placing the torn slip of
paper in his pocket Your grudge is of too long standing to mend
in a day Be that as it may I have a request to make of you from
the boy himself which I hope you will not refuse He has taken a
liking to you it appears and as he will probably be ill for
some weeks he begs that you will come back with me to see him

He finished a little wistfully and stood looking up at the young
man who towered a good head and shoulders above him

I may as well tell you once for all returned Christopher
choking over the words that youve given me as much of Fletcher
as I can stand and a long sight more than I want If anybody but
you had brought me that piece of paper with Bill Fletchers name
tagged to it Id have rammed it down his throat before this As
it is you may tell him from me that when I have paid him to the
last drop what I owe himand not till thenwill I listen to any
message he chooses to send me I hate him and thats my affair
I mean to be even with him some day and I reckon thats my
affair too One thing Im pretty sure of and that is that its
not yours Is your visit over or will you come into the house

Ill be going back now replied the lawyer shrinking from the
outburst but if I may have the pleasure Ill call upon your
mother in the morning

Christopher shook the hand which he held out and then spoke
again in the same muffled voice You may tell him one thing
more he pursued and that is that its the gospel truth I
didnt know it was his grandson in the wagon Why man theres
not a Fletcher on this earth whose neck Id lift my little finger
to save

Then as Carraway passed slowly along the ragged path to the
sunken road he stood looking after him with a heavy frown upon
his brow His rage was at white heat within him and deny it as
he would he knew now that within the last few weeks his hatred
had been strengthened by the force of a newer passion which had
recoiled upon itself Since his parting with Maria Fletcher the
day before he had not escaped for a breath from her haunting
presence She was in his eyes and in the air he breathed the
smell of flowers brought her sweetness to him and the very
sunshine lying upon the September fields thrilled him like the
warmth of her rare smile He found himself fleeing like a hunted
animal from the memory which he could not put away and despite
the almost frenzied haste with which he presently fell to work
he saw always the light and gracious figure which had come to him
along the red clay road The fervour which had shone suddenly in
her eyes the quiver of her mouth as she turned away the poise
of her head the gentle outstretched hand he had repulsed the
delicate curve of her wrist beneath the falling sleeve the very
lace on her bosom fluttering in the still weather as if a light
wind were blowingthese things returned to torture him like the
delirium of fever Appealing as the memory was it aroused in his
distorted mind all the violence of his old fury and he felt
again the desire for revenge working like madness in his blood
It was as if every emotion of his life swept on to empty itself
at last into the wide sea of his hatred




VII In Which Hero and Villain Appear as One

A month later Christophers conversation with Carraway returned
to him when coming one morning from the house with his dogs at
his heels and his squirrel gun on his shoulder he found Will
Fletcher and a troop of spotted foxhound puppies awaiting him
outside the whitewashed gate

I want to speak to you a moment Mr Blake began the boy in
the assured tones of the rich man to the poor The Blake hounds
made a sudden rush at the puppies to be roughly ordered to heel
by their master

Well fire away returned the young man coolly But I may as
well warn you that its more than likely it will be a clear waste
of breath Ill have nothing to do with you or your sort He
leaned on his gun and looked indifferently over the misty fields
where the autumns crop of lifeeverlasting shone silver in the
sunrise

I dont see why you hate me so said the boy wonderingly
checking the too frolicsome adventures of the puppies in the
direction of the hounds Ive always liked you you know even
before you saved my lifebecause youre the straightest shot and
the best trainer of hounds about here Grandpa says I mustnt
have anything to do with you but I will anyway if I please

Oh you will will you was Christophers rejoinder as he
surveyed him with the humorous contempt which the strong so often
feel for the weak of the same sex Well I suppose Ill have my
say in the matter and strangely enough Im on your grandfathers
side The clearer you keep of me the better it will be for you
my man

Thats just like grandpa all over again protested the boy and
when it comes to that he neednt know anything about ithe
doesnt know half that I do anyway he blusters so about
things

Christophers gaze returned slowly from the landscape and rested
inquiringly upon the youthful features before him seeking in
them some definite promise of the future The girlish look of the
mouth irritated him ludicrously and halfforgotten words of
Carraways awoke within his memory

Fletcher loves but one thing on this earth and his ambition is
that the boy shall be respected in the county A Fletcher
respected in the very stronghold of a Blake He laughed aloud
and then spoke hurriedly as if to explain the surprising mirth in
his outburst

So you came to pay a visit to your nearest neighbour and are
afraid your grandfather will find it out Then youll get a
spanking I dare say

Will blushed furiously and stood awkwardly scraping up a pile of
sand with the sole of his boot Im not a baby he blurted out
at last and Ill go where I like whatever he says

He keeps a pretty close watch over you I reckon Perhaps hes
afraid youll become a man and step into his shoes before he
knows it

Oh he cant find me out all the same said the boy slyly He
thinks Ive gone over to Mr Morrisons now to do my Greekhes
crazy about my learning Greek and I hate itand you bet your
life hell be hopping mad if he finds Ive given him the slip

He will will he remarked Christopher and the thought
appeared to afford him a peculiar satisfaction For the first
time the frown left his brow and his tone lost its insolent
contempt Then he came forward suddenly and laid his hand upon
the gate Well I cant waste my morning he said Youd
better run back home and play the piano Im off

I dont play the pianoIm not a girl declared the boy and
what I want is to get you to train my hounds for me Id like to
go hunting with you today

Oh I cant be bothered with babies sneered Christopher in
reply Youd fall down most likely and scratch your knees on
the briers and then youd run straight home to blab to
Fletcher

I wont cried Will angrily Ill never blab Hed be too mad
I tell you if he found it out

Well I dont want you anyhow so get out of my way Youd
better look sharp after your pups or the hounds will chew them
up

The boy stood midway of the road kicking the dust impatiently
ahead of him His lips quivered with disappointment and the
expression gave them a singularly wistful beauty Ill give you
all my pocket money if youll take me with you he pleaded
suddenly stretching out a handful of silver

With a snarl Christopher pushed his arm roughly aside Put up
your money you fool he said I dont want it

Oh you dont dont you taunted the other raging with
wounded pride Why grandpa says youre as poor as Jobs turkey
after it was plucked

It was an old joke of Fletchers who in giving utterance to it
little thought of the purpose it would finally be made to serve
for Christopher halting suddenly at the words swung round in
the cloud of dust and stood regarding the grandson of his enemy
with a thoughtful and troubled look The lawyers words sounded
so distinctly in his ears that he glanced at the boy with a
start fearing that they had been spoken aloud His grandson is
the sole living thing that Fletcher loves Again the
recollection brought a laugh from him which he carelessly threw
off upon the frolics of the puppies Then the frown settled
slowly back upon his brow and the brutal look which Carraway
had found so disfiguring crept out about his mouth

I tell you honestly he said gruffly that if you knew what
was good for you youd scoot back along that road a good deal
faster than you came If youre such a headstrong fool as to want
to come with me however I reckon you may do it One thing
though Ill have no puling ways

The boy jumped with pleasure Why I knew all the time Id get
around you he answered

I always do when I try and may I shoot some with your shotgun

Ill teach you perhaps

When Shall we start now Call the dogs togethertheyre nosing
in the ditch

Without taking the trouble to reply Christopher strode off
briskly along the road and after waiting a moment to assemble
his scattered puppies Will caught up with him and broke into a
running pace at his side As they swung onward the two shadows
the long one and the short onestretched straight and black
behind them in the sunlight

Youre the biggest man about here arent you the boy asked
suddenly glancing upward with frank admiration

I dare say What of it

Oh nothing and your father was the biggest man of his time
Sol Peterkin says and Aunt Mehitable remembers your grandfather
and he was the tallest man alive in his day Wholl be the
biggest when you die I wonder And I say isnt it a pity that
such tall men had to live in such a little old houseI dont see
how they ever got in the doors without stooping Do you have to
stoop when you go in and out

Christopher nodded

Well I shouldnt like that pursued Will and Im glad I
dont live in such a little place Now the doors at the Hall are
so high that I could stand on your shoulders and go in without
bending my head Lets try it some day Grandpa wouldnt know

Christopher turned and looked at him suddenly What would you
say to going possum hunting one night he asked in a queer
voice

Whoopee cried the boy tossing his hat in the air Will you
take me

Well its hard work you know went on the other thoughtfully
Youd have to get up in the middle of the night and steal out of
the window without your grandfathers knowing it

I should say so

Wed tramp till morning probably with the hounds and Tom
Spade would come along to bring his lanterns Then when it was
over wed wind up for drinks at his store Its great sport I
tell you but it takes a man to stand it

Oh Im man enough by now

Not according to your grandfathers thinking

What does he know about it Hes just an old fogy himself

Well see well see If he wants to keep you tied to nurses
strings too long we must play him a trick Why when I was
fourteen I could shoot with any man about hereand drink with
him too for that matter Nobody kept me back you see

The boy looked up at Christopher with sparkling eyes in which
the eternal heroworship of youth was already kindled

Oh youre splendid he exclaimed and Im going to be just
like you Grandpa shant keep me a baby any longer I can tell
you All this Greek nowhes crazy about my learning itand I
hate it Do you know Greek

Christopher laughed shortly Where does he live he inquired
mockingly

For a moment the boy looked at him perplexed Its a language
he replied gravely and grandpa says it comes handy in a
bargain but I wont learn it I hate school anyway and he
swears hes going to send me back in two weeks I hope Ill fall
ill and then he cant

In two weeks repeated the other reflectively well a good
deal may happen I reckon in two weeks

Oh lots agreed the boy with enthusiasm youll let me chase
rabbits with you every daywont you and teach me to shoot and
well go possum hunting one night and not get home till morning
It will be easy enough to fool grandpa Ill take care of that
and if Aunt Saidie finds it out shell never tell himshe never
does tell on me Here let me take the gun awhile will you

Christopher handed him the gun and they went on rapidly along
the old road under the honey locusts that grew beyond the bend
They were nearing the place where Christopher as a child of
twelve had waited with his birdgun in the bushes to shoot
Fletcher when he came in sight and now as the recollection
returned to him he unconsciously slackened his pace and cast his
eyes about for the spot where he had stood It was all there just
as it had been that morningthe red clumps of sumach covered
with gray dust the dried underbrush piled along the fence and
the brown honeyshucks strewn in the sunny road For the first
time in his life he was glad at this instant that he had not
killed Fletcher thenthat his hand had been stayed that day to
fall the heavier it might be at the appointed time The boy
still chatted eagerly and when presently the hounds scented a
rabbit in the sassafras beyond the fence he started with a shout
at the heels of the pursuing pack Swinging himself over the
brushwood Christopher followed slowly across the waste of
lifeeverlasting tearing impatiently through the flowering net
which the wild potato vine cast about his feet

Through the brilliant October day they hunted over the ragged
fields resting at noon to eat the slices of bread and bacon
which Christopher had brought in his pocket As they lay at full
length in the sunshine upon the lifeeverlasting the young mans
gaze flew like a bird across the landscapewhere the gaily
decorated autumn fallows broke in upon the bare tobacco fields
like gaudy patches on a homely garmentto rest upon the faroff
huddled chimneys of Blake Hall For a time he looked steadily
upon them then turning on his side he drew his harvest hat
over his eyes and began a story of his early adventures behind
the hounds speaking in halfgay halfbitter tones

In the mild autumn weather a faint haze overhung the landscape
changing from violet to gray as the shadows rose or fell Around
them the unploughed wasteland swept clear to the distant road
which wound like a muddy river beside the naked tobacco fields
Lying within the slight depression of a hilltop the two were
buried deep amid the lifeeverlasting which shed its soft dust
upon them and filled their nostrils with its ghostly fragrance

As he went on Christopher found a savage delight in mocking the
refinements of the boys language in tossing him coarse
expressions and brutal oaths much as he tossed scraps to the
hounds in touching with vulgar scorn all the conventional ideals
of the householdobedience duty family affection religion
even While he sank still lower in that defiant selfrespect to
which he had always clung doggedly until today there was a
fierce satisfaction in the knowledge that as he fell he dragged
Will Fletcher with himthat he had sold himself to the devil and
got his price

This unholy joy was still possessing him when at nightfall
exhausted dirty brierscratched and bearing their strings of
game they reached Tom Spades and Christopher demanded raw
whisky in the little room behind the store Sol Peterkin was
there astride his barrel and as they entered he gave breath to
a low whistle of astonishment

Why your grandpas been sweepin up the county for you he
exclaimed to Will

So hes found out I wasnt at the Morrisons said the boy a
little nervously Id better be going home I reckon and get it
over

Christopher drained his glass of whisky and then refilling it
pushed it across the table

What Arent you man enough to swallow a thimbleful he asked
with a laugh His face was flushed and the dust of the roads
showed in streaks upon his forehead where the crown of his straw
hat had drawn a circle around his moist fair hair The hand with
which he touched the glass trembled slightly and his eyes were
so reckless that after an instants frightened silence Peterkin
cried out in alarm For the Lords sake Mr Christopher youre
not yourselfits the way his father went you know

What of it demanded Christopher turning his dangerous look
upon the little man If theres a merrier way to go Id like to
know it

Peterkin drew over to the table and laid a restraining hold on
the boys arm Put that down sonny he said I couldnt stand
it and you may be sure itll do you no good It will turn your
stomach clean inside out

He took it replied the boy stubbornly and Ill drink it if
he says so He lifted the glass and stood looking inquiringly at
the man across from him Shall I drink it he asked and waited
with a boyish swagger

Christopher gave a short nod Oh not if youre afraid of it
he responded roughly and then as Will threw back his head and
the whisky touched his lips the other struck out suddenly and
sent the glass shivering to the floor Go home you fool he
cried and keep clear of me for good and all

A moment afterward he had passed from the room through the
store and was out upon the road



CHAPTER VIII Between the Devil and the Deep Sea

There was a cheerful blaze in the old ladys parlour and she was
sitting placidly in her Elizabethan chair the yellow cat dozing
at her footstool Lila paced slowly up and down the room her
head bent a little sideways as she listened to Tuckers cheerful
voice reading the evening chapter from the family Bible His
crutch still strapped to his right shoulder trailed behind him
on the floor and the smoky oil lamp threw his eccentric shadow
on the whitewashed wall where it hung grimacing like a grotesque
from early Gothic art

Many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown
it he read in his even tones if a man would give all the
substance of his house for love it would utterly be condemned

The old lady tapped the arm of her chair and turned her sightless
eyes upon the Bible as if Solomon in person stood there awaiting
judgment

I always liked that verse brother she remarked though I am
not sure that I consider it entirely proper reading for the
young Arent you tired walking Lila

Oh no mother

Well we mustnt take the Scriptures literally you know my
child if we did I fear a great deal of trouble would come of
itand surely it is a pity to magnify the passion of love when
so very many estimable persons get along quite comfortably
without it You remember my remarking how happy Miss Belinda
Morrison always appeared to be and so far as I know she never
had a suitor in her life though she lived to be upward of
eighty

Oh mother and yet you were so madly in love with fatheryou
remember the fancy ball

The fancy ball occupied only one night my dear and Ive had
almost seventy years I married for love as you certainly
knowat my age I suppose I might as well admit itbut the
marriage happened to be also entirely suitable and I hope that I
should never have been guilty of anything so indelicate as to
fall in love with a gentleman who wasnt a desirable match

Lila flushed and bit her lip

I dont care about stations in life nor blood nor anything
like that she protested

The old lady sighed We wont have any more of Solomon Tucker
she observed I fear he will put notions into the childs head
Not care about blood indeed What are we coming to I wonder
Well well I suppose it is what I deserve for allowing myself to
fall so madly in love with your father When I look back now it
seems to me that I could have achieved quite as much with a great
deal less expenditure of emotion

Now now Lucy  said Tucker closing the gilt clasps of the
Bible youre not yet seventy and by the time you reach eighty
you will see things clearer Im a good deal younger than you
but Im twothirds in the grave already which makes a
difference My lifes been long and pleasant as it is but when I
glance back upon it now I tell you the things I regret least in
it are my youthful follies A man must be very far in his dotage
indeed when he begins to wear a long face over the sharp breaths
that he drew in youth I came very near ruining myself for a
woman once and the fact that I was ready to do iteven though I
didntis what in the past I like best to recall today It
makes it all easier and better somehow and it seems to put a
zest into the hours I spend now on my old bench To have had one
emotion that was bigger than you or your universe is to have had
life my dear

The old lady wiped her eyes It may be so brother it may be
so she admitted but not before Lila Is that you
Christopher

The young man came in and crossed slowly to the fire bending for
an instant over her chair He was conscious suddenly that his
clothes smelled of the fields and that the cold water of the well
had not cleansed his face and hands All at once it came to him
with something of a shock that this bare refined poverty was
beyond his levelthat about himself there was a coarseness a
brutality even that made him shrink from contact with these
otherswith his mother with Lila with poor maimed Tucker in
his cotton suit Was it only a distinction in manner he wondered
resentfully or did the difference lie still deeper in some
unlikeness of soul For the first time in his life he felt ill at
ease in the presence of those he loved and as his eyes dwelt
moodily on Lilas graceful figureupon the swell of her low
bosom her swaying hips and the free movement of her limbshe
asked himself bitterly if he had aught in common with so delicate
and rare a thing And she Was her blithe acquiescence after
all but an assumed virtue to whose outward rags she clung Was
it possible that there was here no inward rebellion none of that
warfare against Destiny which at once inspirited and embittered
his heart

His face grew dark and Uncle Boaz coming in to stir the fire
glanced up at him and sighed

You sho do look down in de mouf Marse Chris he observed

Christopher started and then laughed blankly Well Im not
proof against troubles I reckon he returned Theyre things
none of us can keep clear of you know

Uncle Boaz chuckled under his breath Go way fom yer Marse
Chris wat you know bout troubleyou ain even mahed yet

Now now Boaz dont be putting any ideas against marriage in
his head broke in the old lady He has remained single too
long as it is for as dear old Bishop Deane used to say it is
surely the duty of every gentleman to take upon himself the
provision of at least one helpless female Not that I wish you to
enter into marriage hastily my son or for any merely
sentimental reasons but I am sure as things are I believe one
may have a great many trials even if one remains single and
though I know of course that Ive had my share of trouble
still I never blamed your poor father one instantnot even for
the loss of my six children which certainly would not have
happened if I had not married him But as Ive often told you
my dear I think marriage should be rightly regarded more as a
duty than as a pleasure Your Aunt Susannah always said it was
like choosing a partner at a ball for my part I think it
resembles more the selecting of a brand of flour

And to think that she once cried herself sick because
Christopher went hunting during the honeymoon exclaimed Tucker
with his pleasant laugh

Ah life is long and ones honeymoon is only a month brother
retorted the old lady and Im not saying anything against love
you know when it comes to that Properly conducted it is a very
pleasant form of entertainment Ive enjoyed it mightily myself
but Im nearing seventy and the years of love seem very small
when I look back There are many interesting things in a long
life and love for a man is only one among them which brings me
after all to the conclusion that the substance of anybodys
house is a large price to pay for a single feeling

Christopher leaned over her and held out his arms

It is your bedtime mothershall I carry you across he asked
and as the old lady nodded he lifted her as if she were a child
and held her closely against his breast feeling his tenderness
revive at the clasp of her fragile hands When he placed her upon
her bed he kissed her goodnight and went up the narrow
staircase stooping carefully to avoid the whitewashed ceiling
above

Once in his room he threw off his coat and sat down upon the
side of his narrow bed glancing contemptuously at his bare brown
arms which showed through the openings in his blue shirt
sleeves He was still smarting from the memory of the sudden
selfconsciousness he had felt downstairs and a pricking
sensitiveness took possession of him piercing like needles
through the boorish indifference he had worn All at once he
realised that he was ashamed of himselfashamed of his
ignorance his awkwardness his brutalityand with the shame
there awoke the slow anger of a sullen beast Fate had driven him
like a whipped hound to the kennel but he could still snarl back
his defiance from the shadow of his obscurity The strong
masculine beauty of his facethe beauty as Cynthia had said of
the young Davidconfronted him in the little greenish mirror
above the bureau and in the dull misery of the eyes he read
those higher possibilities which even today he could not regard
without a positive pang What he might have been seemed forever
struggling in his look with what he was like the Scriptural
wrestle between the angel of the Lord and the brute The soul
distorted bruised defeated still lived within him and it was
this that brought upon him those hours of mortal anguish which he
had so vainly tried to drown in his glass From the mirror his
gaze passed to his red and knotted hand with its blunted nails
and the straight furrow grew deeper between his eyebrows He
remembered suddenly that his earliest ambitionthe ambition of
his childhoodhad been that of a gentlemanly scholar of the old
order He had meant to sit in a library and read Horace or to
complete the laborious translation of the Iliad which his
father had left unfinished Then his studies had ended abruptly
with the Greek alphabet and from the library he had passed out
to the plough In the years of severe physical labour which
followed he had felt the spirit of the student go out of him
forever and after a few winter nights when he fell asleep over
his books he had sunk slowly to the level of the small tobacco
growers among whom he lived With him also was the curse of
apathythat hereditary instinct to let the single throw decide
the issue so characteristic of the reckless Blakes For more
than two hundred years his people had been gay and careless
livers on this very soil among them all he knew of not one who
had gone without the smallest of his desires nor of one who had
permitted his left hand to learn what his right one cast away
Big blithe mettlesome they passed before him in a long comely
line flushed with the pleasant follies which had helped to sap
the courage in their descendants veins

At first he had made a pitiable attempt to remain within his
class but gradually as time went on this too had left him
and in the end he had grown to feel a certain pride in the
ignorance he had formerly despiseda clownish scorn of anything
above the rustic details of his daily life There were days even
when he took a positive pleasure in the degree of his abasement
when but for his blind mother he would have gone dirty spoken in
dialect and eaten with the hounds What he dreaded most now were
the rare moments of illumination in which he beheld his
degradation by a blaze of lightmoments such as this when he
seemed to stand alone upon the edge of the world with the devil
awaiting him when he should turn at last Years ago he had
escaped these periods by strong physical exertion working
sometimes in the fields until he dropped upon the earth and lay
like a log for hours Later he had yielded to drink when the
darkness closed over him and upon several occasions he had sat
all night with a bottle of whisky in Tom Spades store Both
methods he felt now to be ineffectual fatigue could not deaden
nor could whisky drown the bitterness of his soul One thing
remained and that was to glut his hatred until it should lie
quiet like a gorged beast

Steps sounded all at once upon the staircase and after a moment
the door opened and Cynthia entered

Did you see Fletchers boy Christopher she asked His
grandfather was over here looking for him

Fletcher over here Well of all the impudence

He was very uneasy but he stopped long enough to ask me to
persuade you to part with the farm Hed give three thousand
dollars down for it he said

She dusted the bureau abstractedly with her checked apron and
then stood looking wistfully into the mirror

Is that so If hed give me three million I wouldnt take it
answered Christopher

It seems a mistake dear said Cynthia softly of course Id
hate to oblige Fletcher too but we are so poor and the money
would mean so much to us I used to feel as you do but somehow I
seem all worn out nowsoul as well as body I havent the
strength left to hate

Well I have returned Christopher shortly and Ill have it
when Im gasping over my last breath You neednt bother about
that business Cynthia I can keep up the family record on my own
account Whats the proverb about usa Blake can hate twice as
long as most men can lovethats my way you know

You didnt finish it said Cynthia turning from the bureau
its all downstairs in the Life of Bolivar Blake you remember
Colonel Byrd got it off in a toast at a wedding breakfast and
Greatgrandfather Bolivar was so proud of it he had it carved
above his library door

High and mighty old chap wasnt he But whats the rest

What he really said was A Blake can hate twice as long as most
men can love and love twice as long as most men can live

Christopher looked down suddenly at his great bronzed hands Oh
he neednt have stuck the tail of it on he remarked carelessly
but the first part has a bully sound

When Cynthia had gone he undressed and threw himself on the bed
but there was a queer stinging sensation in his veins and he
could not sleep Rising presently he opened the window and in
the frosty October air stood looking through the darkness to the
light that twinkled in the direction of Blake Hall Faint stars
were shining overhead and against the indistinct horizon
something obscure and black was dimly outlinedperhaps the great
clump of oaks that surrounded the old brick walls Somewhere by
that glimmer of light he knew that Fletcher sat hugging his
ambition like a miser gloating over the grandson who would grow
up to redeem his name For the weak foolishmouthed boy
Christopher at this moment knew neither tolerance nor compassion
and if he stooped to touch him he felt that it was merely as he
would grasp a stick which Fletcher had taken for his own defense
The boy himself might live or die prosper or fail it made
little difference The main thing was that in the end Bill
Fletcher should be hated by his grandson as he was hated by the
man whom he had wronged



CHAPTER IX As the Twig is Bent

It was two weeks after this that Fletcher looking up from his
coffee and cakes one morning demanded querulously Whars Will
Saidie It seems to me he sleeps late these days

Oh he was up hours ago responded Miss Saidie from behind the
florid silver service I believe he has gone rabbit hunting with
that young Blake 

Fletcher laid down his knife and fork and glowered suspiciously
upon his sister the syrup from his last mouthful hanging in
drops on his coarse gray beard

With young Blake Why whats the meaning of that he inquired

Its only that Wills taken to him I think Thars no harm in
this hunting rabbits that I can see and it keeps the child out
of doors anyway Fresh air is what the doctor said he needed
you know

I dont like it I dont like it protested Fletcher those
Blakes are as mad as bulldogs and theyve been so as far back as
I can remember The sooner a stops put to this thing the better
itll be How long has it been going on I wonder About ten
days I believe and it does seem to give the boy such an
interest I cant help feeling its a pity to break it up

Oh bother you and your feelings was Fletchers retort If
youd had the sense you ought to have had it never would have
started but youve always had a mushy heart and I ought to have
allowed for it I reckon Tharre two kind of women in this
world the mulish and the pulish an when it comes to a mans
taking his pick between em the Lord help him As for that young
Blakewell if I had to choose between him and the devil Id
take up with the devil mighty fast thats all

Oh Brother Bill he saved the childs life

Well he didnt do it on purpose he told me so himself I tried
to settle that fair and square with him you know and he had the
face to tear my check in half and send it back Oh I dont like
this thing I tell you and I wont have it Ive no doubt its
at the bottom of all Wills cutting up about school too He was
not well enough to go yesterday he said and here hes getting
up this morning at daybreak and streaking heaven knows whar
with a beggar You may as well pack his thingsIll ship him off
tomorrow if Im alive

I hope you wont scold him anyway hes not strong you know
and its good for him to have a little pleasure Im sure I cant
see what you have against the Blakes as far as that goes I
remember the old gentleman when I was a childso fine and
clean and pleasant it was a sight just to see him ride by on
his dappled horse He always lifted his hat to me too when he
passed me in the road and once he gave me some peaches for
opening the red gate for him I never could help liking him and
I was sorry when he lost his money and they had to sell the
Hall

Fletcher choked over his coffee and grew purple in the face

Hang your puling he cried harshly Ill not stand it do you
hear The old man was a beggarly cheating spendthrift and the
young one is a long sight worse Id rather wring Wills neck
than have him mixed up with that batch of paupers

Miss Saidie shrunk back frightened behind the silver service

Of course you know best brother she hastened to acknowledge
with her unfailing goodhumour Im as fond of the child as you
are I reckonand of Maria too for that matter Have you seen
this photograph she sent me yesterday taken at some outlandish
place across the water I declare I had no idea she was half so
handsome She has begun to wear her hair low and has filled out
considerable

Well there was room for it commented Fletcher as he glanced
indifferently at the picture and laid it down Get Wills
clothes packed today remember He starts off tomorrow morning
rain or shine

Pushing back his chair he paused to gulp a last swallow of
coffee and then stamped heavily from the room

At dinner Will did not appear and when at last the supper bell
jangled in the hall and Fletcher strode in to find the boys
place still empty the shadow upon his brow grew positively
black As they rose from the table there were brisk light steps
along the hall and Will entered hurriedly warm and dusty after
the days hunt Catching sight of his grandfather he started
nervously and the boyish animation he had brought in from the
fields faded quickly from his face which took on a sly and
dogged look

Whar in the devils name have you been suh demanded Fletcher
bluntly

The boy hesitated seeking the inevitable defenses of the weak
pitted against the strong Ive been teaching my hounds to hunt
rabbits he replied after a moment Zebbadee was with me

So you were too sick to start for school this morning eh
pursued Fletcher hurt and angry Only well enough to go
traipsing through the bushes after a pack of brutes

I had a headache but it got better May I go up now to wash my
hands

For an instant Fletcher regarded him in a brooding silence then
with that remorseless cruelty which is the strangest
manifestation of wounded love he loosened upon the boys head
all the violence of his smothered wrath

Youll do nothing of the kind I aint done with you yet and
when I am I reckon you will know it Mark my words if you warnt
such a girlish looking chap Id take my horsewhip to your
shoulders in a jiffy So this is the return I get is it for all
my trouble with you since the day you were born Tricks and lies
are all the reward Im to expect I reckon Well youll learn
once for all nowthat when you undertake to fool me its a
clear waste of time Ive found out whar youve been today and
I know youve been sneaking across the county with that darn
Blake

The boy looked at him steadily first with speechless terror
then with a cowed and sullen rage The glare in Fletchers eyes
fascinated him and he stood motionless on his spot of carpet as
if he were held there in an invisible vise Weakling as he was
he had been humoured too long to bear the lash submissively at
last and beneath the tumult of words that overwhelmed him he
felt his anger flow like an infusion of courage in his veins The
greater share of love was still on his grandfathers side and
the knowledge of this lent a sullen defiance to his voice

You bluster so I cant hear he said blinking fast to shut out
the others eyes If I did go with Christopher Blake whats the
harm in it I only lied because you make such a fuss it gives me
a headache

Its the first fuss I ever made with you I reckon returned
Fletcher softening before the accusation If I ever fussed with
you before sonny you may make mighty certain you deserved it

You frighten me half to death when you rage so persisted the
boy snatching craftily at his advantage

There there well get it over said Fletcher quieting
instantly I didnt mean to scare you that way but the truth is
it put me in a passion to hear of you mixing up with that scamp
Blake Jest keep clear of him and Ill ask nothing more of you
You may chase all your rabbits between here and kingdom come for
aught I care but if I ever see you alongside of Christopher
Blake again I tell you Ill lick you until youre black and
blue And now hurry up and git your supper and go to bed for you
start to school tomorrow morning at sunrise

Will flushed and stood blinking his eyes in the lamplight

I dont want to go to school grandpa he said persuasively

Thats a pity sonny because youve got to go whether you like
it or not Your Aunt Saidie has gone and packed your things and
Ill give you a months pocket money to start with

But Id rather stay at home and study with Mr Morrison Then I
could follow after the hounds in the afternoon and keep out in
the fresh air as the doctor said I must

Now now weve had enough of this said Fletcher decisively
Youll do what I say mind you and youll do it quick No
haggling over it do you hear

Will looked at him sullenly nerved by that reckless anger which
so often passes for pure daring

If you make me go youll be sorry grandpa he said choking

Fletcher swallowed an uneasy laugh strangled over it and
finally spat it out with a wad of tobacco

Why what blamed maggot have you got in your head son he
inquired laying his heavy hand on the boys shoulder You
didnt use to hate school so and as sure as youre born youll
find it first rate sport when you get back Its this Blake
business thats what it ishes gone and stuffed you plum full
of notions Look here now you dont want to grow up to be a
dunce like him do you

He had touched the raw at last and Will broke out passionately
in revolt inflamed by a boyish admiration for his own bravado

Hes got a lot more sense than anybody about here he cried
backing against the door and holding tightly to the handle and
if he doesnt know that plaguey Greek its because he says there
isnt any use in it Why he can shoot a bird on the wing over
his shoulder and mount a horse at full gallop and tell stories
that make you creep all over Hes not a dunce grandpa hes my
friend and I like him

The last words came in a sudden spurt for feeling his
artificial courage ooze out of him the boy had started in a run
from the room He had barely crossed the threshold however when
Fletcher reached out with a strong grip and pulled him back
swinging him slowly round until the two stood face to face

Now heres one thing flat said the man in a husky voice if I
ever see or hear of you opening your mouth to that rascal again
Ill thrash you until you havent a sound bone in your body
Youd better go up now and say your prayers

As he released his grasp the boy struck out at him with a
nerveless gesture and then shot like an arrow through the hall
and out into the twilight At the moment his terror of Fletcher
was forgotten in the paroxysm of his anger Short sobs broke from
him as he ran and presently his breath came in pants like those
of an overdriven horse but still without slackening his pace
he sped on to the old icepond and then wheeled past the turning
into the sunken road Not until he had reached the long gate
before the Blake cottage did he stop short suddenly and stand
grasping his moist shirt collar in an effort to quiet his
convulsed breathing

The hounds greeted him with a single bay and at the noise
Cynthia came out upon the porch and then down into the gravelled
path between the old rosebushes

What do you wish she demanded stiffly standing severe and
erect in her faded silk

I must speak to ChristopherI must gasped the boy breathing
hard I am going away tomorrow and this is my last chance

Well hes in the stable I believe replied Cynthia coolly
If you want him you must go there to look for him and be sure
not to make a noise when you pass the house Then as he darted
away her eyes followed him with a weary aversion

Will passed the kitchen and the woodpile and turning into a
little path that led from the well came to the open door of the
rudely built stable A dim light fell in a square across the
threshold and looking inside he saw that a lantern was hanging
from a nail above the nearest stall and that within the circle of
its illumination Christopher was busily currying the old gray
mare

At the boys entrance he paused for an instant glanced
carelessly over the side of the stall and then went on with his
work

Playing nightowl eh he remarked indifferently Theres no
rubbingdown for you to do I reckon

Theres a darn sight worse returned the boy throwing out the
oath with a conscious swagger as he braced himself against the
ladder that ran up to the loft

His tone arrested Christophers hand and lifting his head the
young man stood attentively regarding him one arm lying upon the
broad back of the old mare

Why whats up now he questioned with a smile Some fine
chaff which he had brought down from the loft still clung to
his hair and clothes and darkened his upper lip like a mustache

Grandpas found it out and hes hopping said the boy I
always told you he would be you know and now its come If he
ever catches me with you again he swears hell give it to me like
hell He pressed tightly against the ladder and wagged his head
defiantly But he neednt think he can bully me like thatnot
if I know it

Well he mustnt catch you again returned Christopher not
troubling to soften his scorn of such cheap heroics we must
manage better next time Did you think to remind him by the way
that I once took the trouble to save your life

Thats a fact I didnt think of it What would he have said I
wonder

Christopher raised his eyebrows Knocked your front teeth out
perhaps Hes like that isnt he

Oh hes awfully fond of me you know protested the boy but
its his meddling ways that I cant stand What business is it of
his who my friends are He hasnt got to take up with em has
he Why what he hates is for me to want to be with anybody but
himself or Aunt Saidie Hed like to keep me dangling all day to
his coat tails but its not fair and I wont have it Ill show
him whether Im to be kept a kid forever or not

Theres spirit for you drawled Christopher with a laugh as he
applied the currycomb to the mares flank

You just wait till you hear the worst returned the other with
evident pride in the thunderbolt about to be delivered He
swears hes going to send me to school tomorrow at sunrise

You dont say so ejaculated Christopher

Oh but hell do it toothe only way to get around him is to
fall ill and I cant work that tomorrow I played the trick last
week and he saw through it Ive got to go thats certain but
Im going to make him sorry enough before hes done Why couldnt
he let me keep on studying with Mr Morrison as the doctor said
I ought to Whats the use of this blamed old Latin and Greek
anyway Nobody about here knows them and why should I set myself
up for a precious numbskull of a scholar Id rather be a crack
shot like you any day I tell you one thing he finished
sucking in his breath in a way that had annoyed Christopher from
the first Ive half a mind to run away or fall ill after I get
there

Christopher turned suddenly slapped the mare on the flank and
came out of the stall the currycomb still in his hand His shirt
sleeves were rolled above his elbows and the muscles of his arms
stood out like cords under the sunburned skin which showed a
paler bronze from the wrists up He was flushed from leaning
over and his clothes smelled strongly of the stable

If you do come to me  he said lightly and Ill hide you in
the barn till the storm blows over It wouldnt last long I
reckon

Bless you no when hes scared I can do anything with him Why
he was as soft as mush after the horses ran away with me though
hed threatened to thrash me if I touched the reins Oh I say
its a shame we never had that possum hunt

Christopher turned down his shirt sleeves and brushed the chaff
from his face

What do you say about tonight he inquired with something
like a sneer We couldnt go far of course and wed have to
borrow Tom Spades houndsmine are tired outbut we might have
a short run about midnight get a possum or so and be in our
beds before daybreak Shall we try it

The boy wavered struggling between his desire for the chase and
his fear of Fletcher

Of course if youre afraid added Christopher slowly

Im not afraid broke out Will angrily Im not afraid and you
know it You be at the store by eleven and Ill get out of the
window and join you Grandpa will never know and if he
doeswell Ill settle him

Then be quick about it was Christophers retort and as the
boy ran out into the darkness he followed him to the door and
stood gazing moodily down upon the yellow circle that his lantern
cast on the bare ground A massive fatigue oppressed him and his
hands and feet had become like leaden weights There was a
heaviness too about his head and his eyeballs burned as if he
had looked too long at a bright light At the moment he felt like
a man who being bound upon a wheel is whirled so rapidly around
that he is dazed by the continuous revolutions What did it all
mean anywaythe boy Fletcher himself and the revenge which
he now saw so clearly before him Was it a great divine judgment
or a great human cruelty

Question as he would the wheel still turned and he knew that
for good or evil he was bound upon it until the end



CHAPTER X Powers of Darkness

October dragged slowly along and Christopher followed his work
upon the farm with the gloomy indifference which had become the
settled expression of his attitude toward life Since the morning
when he had seen Will drive by to the crossroads he had heard
nothing of him and gradually as the weeks went on that last
reckless night behind the hounds had ceased to represent a cause
either of rejoicing or of regret He had not meant to goad the
boy into drinkingof this he was quite sureand yet when the
hunt was over and the two stood just before dawn in Tom Spades
room he had felt the devil enter into him and take possession
The old mad humour of his blood ran high and as the raw whisky
fired his imagination he was dimly conscious that his talk grew
wilder and that the surrounding objects swam before his gaze as
if seen through a fog Life for the time at least lost its
relative values the moment loomed larger in his vision than the
years and he beheld the past and the future dwarfed by the
single radiant instant that was his own It was as if he could
pay back the score of a lifetime in that one minute

Is it possible that what was so difficult yesterday should have
grown so easy today he asked himself astonished Why have I
never seen so clearly before Why until this evening have I
gone puling about my life as if such things as disgrace and
poverty were sufficient to crush the strength out of a man Let
me put forth all my courage and nothing is impossiblenot even
the attainment of success nor the punishment of Fletcher It is
only necessary to begin at onceto hasten about ones taskand
in a few short years it will be accomplished and done with All
will be as I wish and I shall then be as happy as Tucker

Following this came the questions How When Where shall I
beginbut he put them angrily aside and refilled his glass A
great goodhumour possessed him and as he drank all the
unpleasant things of lifeloss unrest heavy labourvanished
in the roseate glow that pervaded his thoughts

What came of it was not quite clear to him next day and this
caused the uneasiness that lasted for a week He had a vague
recollection that Tom Spade took the boy home and rolled him
through the window and that he himself went whistling to his bed
with the glorious sensation that he was riding the crest of a big
wave With the morning came a severe headache and the ineffectual
effort to remember just how far it had all gone and then a sharp
anxiety which vanished when he saw Will pass on his way to
school

The boy was none the worse for it Tom Spade told him later
he had a drop too much to be sure but his legs were as steady
as mine an he slept it off in an hour Hes a ticklish chap
Mr Christopher the storekeeper added after a moment an Id
keep my hands from meddlin with him if I was you That thing
shant happen agin at my place an it wouldnt have happened
then if Id been around at the beginnin You may tamper with yo
own salvation as much as you pleasethats my gospel but Ill
be hanged if youve got a right to tamper with anybody elses

Christopher wheeled suddenly about and gave him a keen glance
from under his lowered eyelids For the first time he detected a
lack of deference in Tom Spades tone and a suspicion shot
through him that the words were meant to veil a reprimand

Well I reckon the boys got as good a right to drink as I
have he retorted sneeringly and a moment afterward went gaily
whistling through the store At the time he felt a certain
pleasure in defying Toms opinionin setting himself so boldly
in opposition to the conventional morality of his neighbours The
situation gave him several sharp breaths and that dizzy sense of
insecurity in which his mood delighted It had needed only the
shade of disapproval expressed in the storekeepers voice to lend
a wonderful piquancy to his enjoymentto cause him to toy in
imagination with his hatred as a man does with his desire Before
Tom spoke he had caught himself almost regretting the
affairwondering even if his error were past retrievingbut
with the first mere suggestion of outside criticism his humour
underwent a startling change

Between Fletcher and himself the account was still open and the
way in which he meant to settle it concerned himself aloneleast
of all did it concern Tom Spade

He was groping confusedly among these reflections when one
evening in early November he went upstairs after a hasty supper
to find Cynthia already awaiting him in his room At his start of
displeased surprise she came timidly forward and touched his arm

Are you sick Christopher or has anything happened You are so
unlike yourself

He shook his head impatiently and her hand fell from his sleeve
It occurred to him all at once with an aggrieved irritation
that of late his family had failed him in sympathythat they had
ceased to value the daily sacrifices he made Almost with horror
he found himself asking the next instant whether the simple bond
of blood was worth all that he had givenworth his youth his
manhood his ambition Until this moment his course had seemed to
him the one inevitable outcome of circumstancesthe one
appointed path for him to tread but even as he put the question
he saw in a sudden illumination that there might have been
another waythat with the burden of the three women removed he
might have struck out into the world and at least have kept his
own head above water With his next breath the horror of his
thought held him speechless and he turned away lest Cynthia
should read his degradation in his eyes

Happened Why what should have happened he inquired with
attempted lightness Good Lord After a days work like mine you
can hardly expect me to dance a hornpipe Since sunrise Ive done
a turn at fall ploughing felled and chopped a tree mended the
pasture fence brought the water for the washing tied up some
tobacco leaves and looked after the cattle and the horsesand
now you find fault because I havent cut any extra capers

Not find fault dear she answered and the hopeless courage in
her face smote him to the heart In a bitter revulsion of feeling
he felt that he could not endure her suffering tenderness

Find fault with you Oh Christopher It is only that you have
been so different of late so brooding and you seem to avoid us
at every instant Even mother has noticed it and she imagines
that you are in love

In love he threw back his head with a loud laugh Oh Im
tired Cynthiadogtired thats the matter

I know I know replied Cynthia rubbing her eyes hard with the
back of her hand And the worst is that theres no help for
itabsolutely none I think about it sometimes until I wonder
that I dont go mad

He turned at this from the window through which he had been
gazing and fixed upon her a perplexed and moody stare The
wistful patience in her face like the look he had seen in the
eyes of overworked farm animals aroused in him a desire to prod
her into actual revoltinto any decisive rebellion against fate
To accept life upon its own terms seemed to him at the instant
pure cowardlinessthe enforced submission of a weakened will
and he questioned almost angrily if the hereditary instincts were
alive in her also Did she too have her secret battles and her
silent capitulations Or was her pious resignation after all
only a new form of the old Blake maladyof that fatal apathy
which seized them like disease when events demanded strenuous
endeavour Could the saintly fortitude he had once so envied be
when all was said merely the outward expression of the inertia
he himself had feltof the impulse to drift with the tide let
it carry one where it would

Well Im glad its no worse said Cynthia with a sigh of
relief as she turned toward the door Since you are not sick
dear things are not so bad as they might be Ill let mother
fancy you have what she calls a secret sentiment It amuses
her at any rate And now Im going to stir up some buckwheat
cakes for your breakfast Weve got a jug of black molasses

Thats pleasant at least he returned laughing and then as
she reached the door he went toward her and laid his hand
awkwardly upon her shoulder Dont worry about me Cynthia he
added theres a lot of work left in me yet and a change for
the better may come any day you know By next year the price of
tobacco may shoot skyhigh

Her face brightened and a flush smoothed out all the fine
wrinkles on her brow but with the pathetic shyness of a woman
who has never been caressed she let his hand fall stiffly from
her arm and went hurriedly from the room

For a few minutes Christopher stood looking abstractedly at the
closed door Then shaking his head as if to rid himself of an
accusing thought he turned away and began rapidly to undress He
had thrown off his coat and was stooping to remove his boots
when a slight noise at the window startled him and straightening
himself instantly he awaited attentively a repetition of the
sound In a moment it came again and hastily crossing the room
and raising the sash he looked out into the full moonlight and
saw Will Fletcher standing in the gravelled path below At the
first glance surprise held him motionless but as the boy waved
to him he responded to the signal and catching up his coat from
the bed ran down the staircase and out into the yard

What in the devils name he exclaimed aghast

Will was trembling from exhaustion and his face glimmered like a
pallid blotch under the shadow of the aspen When the turkeys
stirred on an overhanging bough above him he started nervously
and sucked in his breath with a hissing sound He was run to
death this Christopher saw at the first anxious look

Get me something to eat said the boy Im half starvedbut
bring it to the barn for Im too dead tired to stand a moment
Yes I ran away of course he finished irritably Do I look as
if Id come in grandpas carriage

With a last spurt of energy he disappeared into the shadows
behind the house and Christopher going into the kitchen began
searching the tin safe for the chance remains of supper On the
table was the bowl of buckwheat which Cynthia had been preparing
when she was called away by some imperious demand of her
mothers and near it he saw the open prayerbook from which she
had been reading From the adjoining room he heard Tuckers
voicethose rich pleasant tones that translated into sound the
courageous manliness of the old soldiers faceand for an
instant he yearned toward the cheerful group sitting in the
firelight beyond the whitewashed walltoward the blind woman in
her old oak chair listening to the evening chapter from the
Scriptures Then the feeling passed as quickly as it had come
and securing a plate of bread and a dried hambone he filled a
glass with fresh milk and picking up his lantern went out of
doors and along the little straggling path to the barn

The yard was frosted over with moonlight but when he reached the
rude building where the farm implements and cattle fodder were
sheltered he saw that it was quite dark inside only a few
scattered moonbeams crawling through the narrow doorway To his
first call there was no answer and it was only after he had
lighted his lantern and swung it round in the darkness that he
discovered Will lying fast asleep upon a pile of straw

As the light struck him full in the face the boy opened his eyes
and sprang up

Why its you he said in a relieved voice I thought it was
grandpa If he comes youve got to keep him out you know

He spoke in an excited whisper and his eyes plunged beyond the
entrance with a look of pitiable and abject terror Once or twice
he shivered as if from cold and then turning away cowered into
the pile of straw in search of warmth

For a time Christopher stood gazing uneasily down upon him Look
here man this cant keep up he said Youd better go
straight home thats my opinion and get into a decent bed

Will started up again I wont see him I wont he cried
angrily If you bring him here Ill get up and hide I wont see
him Why he almost killed me after that possum hunt we had and
if he found this out so soon hed kill me outright There was an
awful rumpus at school They wrote him and he said he was coming
so I ran away It was all his fault too he had no business to
send me back again when he knew how I hated it I told him hed
be sorry

Well he shant get in here tonight returned Christopher
soothingly Ill keep him out with a shotgun bless him if he
shows his face Come now sit up and eat a bit or there wont
be any fight left in us

Will took the food obediently but before it touched his lips the
hand in which he held it dropped limply to the straw

I cant eat he complained with a gesture of disgust Im too
sickIve been sick for days It was all grandpas doing too
When I heard he was coming I went out and got soaking wet and
then slept in my clothes all night I knew hed never make a fuss
if I could only get ill enough but the next morning I felt all
right so I came away

Kneeling upon the floor Christopher held the glass to his lips
gently forcing him to drink a few swallows Then dipping his
handkerchief in the cattle trough outside he bathed the boys
face and hands and loosening his clothes made him as
comfortable as he could This wont do you know he urged
presently alarmed by Wills difficult breathing You are in for
a jolly little spell and I must get you home Your grandfather
will never bother you while youre sick

At the words the boy clung to him deliriously breaking into
frightened whimpers such as a child makes in the dark I wont
go back I wont go back he repeated wildly hell never
believe Im ill and I wont go back

All right that settles it Lie quiet and Ill fetch you some
bedding from my room Then Ill fix you a pallet out here and
well put up as best we can till morning

Dont stay dont stay pleaded Will as the other leaving his
lantern on the floor ran out into the moonlight

Returning in a quarter of an hour he threw a small featherbed
down upon the straw and settled the boy comfortably upon it Then
he covered him with blankets and after closing the door came
back and stood watching for him to fall asleep A slight draft
blew from the boarded window and taking off his coat he hung
it carefully across the cracks shading the lantern with his hand
that its light might not flash in the sleepers face

At his step Will gave a stifled moan and looked up in terror

I thought youd left me Dont go he begged stretching out
his hand until it grasped the others With the hot nerveless
clutch upon him Christopher was conscious of a quick repulsion
and he remembered the sensation he had felt as a boy when he had
once suddenly brought his palm down on a little green snake that
was basking in the sunshine on an old log Yet he did not shake
the hand off and when presently the blanket slipped from Wills
shoulders he stooped and replaced it with a strange gentleness
The disgust he felt was so evenly mingled with compassion that
as he stood there he could not divide the one emotion from the
other He hated the boys touch and yet almost in spite of
himself he suffered it

Well Im not going so you neednt let that worry you he
replied Ill stretch myself alongside of you in the straw and
if you happen to want me just yell out you know

The weak fingers closed tightly about his wrist

You promise asked the boy

Oh I promise answered the other raising the lantern for a
last look before he blew it out

By early daybreak Wills condition was still more alarming and
leaving him in a feverish stupor upon the pallet Christopher set
out hurriedly shortly after sunrise to carry news of the boys
whereabouts to Fletcher

It was a clear cold morning and the old brick house set midway
of the autumn fields appeared as he approached it to reflect
the golden light that filled the east Never had the place seemed
to him more desirable than it did as he went slowly toward it
along the desolate November roads The somber colours of the
landscape the bared majesty of the old oaks where a few leaves
still clung to the topmost boughs the deserted garden filled
with wan specters of summer flowers were all in peculiar harmony
with his own mood as with the stern gray walls wrapped in naked
creepers That peculiar sense of ownership was strongly with him
as he ascended the broad steps and lifted the old brass knocker
which still bore the Blake coat of arms

To his astonishment the door opened instantly and Fletcher
himself appeared upon the threshold At sight of Christopher he
fell back as if from a blow in the chest ripping out an oath
with a big downward gesture of his closed fist

So you are mixed up in it are you Whars the boy From the
dusk of the hall his face shone dead white about the eyes

If you want to get anything out of me youd better curb your
tongue Bill Fletcher replied Christopher coolly feeling an
animal instinct to prolong the torture If you think its any
satisfaction to me to have your young idiot thrown on my hands
you were never more mistaken in your life Ive been up half the
night with him and the sooner you take him away the better Ill
like it

Oh you leave him to me and Ill settle him responded
Fletcher reaching for his hat Jest show me whar he is and Ill
git even with him befo sundown As for you young man Ill have
the sheriff after you yit

In the meantime youd better have the doctor The boys ill I
tell you He came to me last evening run to death and with a
high fever He slept in the barn and this morning he is
decidedly worse If you come bring Doctor Cairn with you and I
warn you now youve got to use a lot of caution Your grandson is
mortally afraid of you and he threatens to run away if I let you
know where he is He wants me to sit at the door with a shotgun
and keep you off

He delivered his blows straight out from the shoulder lingering
over each separate word that he might enjoy to the full its
stupendous effect

This is your doing repeated Fletcher hoarsely its your
doing every blamed bit of it

Christopher laughed shortly Well Im through with my errand
he said moving toward the steps and pausing with one hand on a
great white column The sooner you get him out of my barn the
better riddance it will be Theres one thing certain though
and that is that you dont lay eyes on him without the doctor
Hes downright ill on my oath

Oh its the same old trick and I see through it exclaimed
Fletcher furiously Its pure shamming

All the same Ive got my gun on hand and you dont go into
that barn alone He hung for an instant upon the topmost step
then descended hurriedly and walked rapidly back along the broad
white walk It would be an hour at least before Fletcher could
follow him with Doctor Cairn and after he had returned to the
barn and given Will a glass of new milk he fed and watered the
horses and did the numberless small tasks about the house He was
at the woodpile chopping some light wood splinters for Cynthia
when the sound of wheels reached him and in a little while more
the head of Fletchers mare appeared around the porch Doctor
Cairn a frousy whitebearded old man crippled from rheumatism
held out his hand to Christopher as he descended with some
difficulty between the wheels of the buggy

Christopher motioned to the barn and then taking the reins
fastened the horse to the branch of a young ailanthus tree which
grew near the woodpile As he watched the figures of the two men
pass along the little path between the fringes of dead yarrow he
drew an uneasy breath and dug his boot into the rotting mould
upon the ground The barn door opened and closed there was a
short silence and then a sudden despairing cry as of a rabbit
caught in the jaws of a hound When he heard it he turned
impulsively from the horses head and went quickly along the path
the men had taken There was no definite intention in his mind
but as he reached the barn door it shot open and Fletcher put out
a white face

The Doctor wants you Mr Christopher he cried Will has gone
clean mad

Without a word Christopher pushed by him and went into the great
dusky room where the boy was struggling like a madman to loosen
the doctors grasp He was conscious at the moment that the air
was filled with fine chaff and that he sucked it in when he
breathed

At his entrance Will lay quiet for a moment and looked at him
with dazed questioning eyes

Keep them out Christopher he cried in anguish

Christopher crossed the room and laid his hand with a protecting
gesture on the boys head

Why to be sure I will he said heartily the devil himself
wont dare to touch you when I am by 



BOOK III

THE REVENGE


CHAPTER I In Which Tobacco is Hero

On an October afternoon some four years later at the season of
the year when the whole county was fragrant with the curing
tobacco Christopher Blake passed along the stretch of old road
which divided his farm from the Weatherbys and without
entering the porch called for Jim from the little walk before
the flat whitewashed steps In response to his voice Mrs
Weatherby a large motherly looking woman appeared upon the
threshold and after chatting a moment directed him to the log
tobacco barn where the recently cut crop was drying out

Jim and Jacob are both over thar she said  an a few others
for the matter of that who have been helpin us press new cider
an drinkin the old Im sure I dont see why they want to
lounge out thar in all that smoke but thars no accountin for
the taste of a man that ever I heard tell of an I reckon they
kin fancy pretty easy that they are settin plum in the bowl of a
pipe It beats me though that it do Why one mouthful of it is
enough to start me coughin for a week an those men thar jest
swallow it down for pure pleasure Clean kindly hospitable
she wandered garrulously on remembering at intervals to press
the young man to come inside an try the cakes an cider

No Ill look them up out there said Christopher resisting
the invitation to enter I want to get a pair of horseshoes from
Jim the gray mare cast hers yesterday and Dick Boxley is laid
up with a sprained arm Oh no thanks I must be going back
With a friendly nod he turned from the steps and went rapidly
along the path which led to the distant barn

As Mrs Weatherby had said the place was like the bowl of a
pipe and it was a moment before Christopher discovered the
little group gathered about the doorway where a shutter hung
loosely on wooden hinges

The ancient custom of curing tobacco with open fires which had
persisted in Virginia since the days of the early settlers was
still commonly in use and it is possible that had one of
Christophers colonial ancestors appeared at the moment in Jacob
Weatherbys log barn it would have been difficult to convince him
that between his death and his resurrection there was a lapse of
more than two hundred years He would have found the same square
penlike structure built of straight logs carefully notched at
the corners the same tierpoles rising at intervals of three
feet to the roof the same hewn plates to support the rafters
the same daubing of the chinks with red clay and the same
crude door cut in the south wall From the roof the tobacco hung
in a fantastic decoration shading from dull green to deep
bronze and appearing when viewed from the ground below to
resemble a numberless array of small furled flags On the hard
earth floor there were three parallel rows of unseasoned logs
which burned slowly day and night filling the barn with gray
smoke and the pungent odour of the curing tobacco

It takes a heap of lookin arter an no mistake old Jacob was
remarking as he surveyed the fine crop with the bland and easy
gaze of ownership Why in a little while them top leaves thar
will be like tinder an the first floatin spark will set it all
afire Thats the way Sol Peterkin lost half a crop last year
an its the way Dick Moss lost his whole one the year before
At Christophers entrance he paused and turned his pleasant
ruddy face from the fresh logs which he had been watching So
you want to have a look at my tobaccy too he added with the
healthful zest of a child Well its worth seein if I do say
so thar hasnt been sech leaves raised in this county within the
memory of man

Thats so said Christopher with an appreciative glance Im
looking for Jim but hes keeping up the fires isnt he Then
he turned quickly for Tom Spade who with young Matthew Field
had been critically weighing the promise of Jacobs crop broke
out suddenly into a boisterous laugh

Why I declar Mr Christopher if you aint lost yo shadow
he exclaimed

Christopher regarded him blankly for a moment and then joined
lightly in the general mirth Oh you mean Will Fletcher he
returned There was a pretty girl in the road as we came up and
I couldnt get him a step beyond her Heaven knows whats become
of him by now

I bet my right hand that was Molly Peterkin said Tom If
anybody in these parts begins to talk about a pretty gal you
may be sartain hes meanin that yallerheaded limb of Satan
Why I stopped my Jinnie goin with her a year ago Sech women I
said to her are fit for nobody but men to keep company with

Thats so thats so agreed old Jacob in a charitable tone
seein as men have most likely made em what they are an
oughtnt to be ashamed of thar own handiwork

Now when it comes to yaller hair an blue eyes put in Matthew
Field she kin hold her own agin any wedded wife that ever made
a man regret the day of his birth Manys the time of late Ive
gone a good halfmile to git out of that gals way jest as I
used to cut round old Fletchers pasture when I was a boy to keep
from passin by his redheart cherrytree that overhung the road
Well well they do say that her young man Fred Turner went
back on her an threw her on her fathers hands two days befo
the weddin

It was hard on Sol now you come to think of it said Tom He
told me himself that he tried to git the three who ought to marry
her to draw straws for the one who was to be the happy man but
they all backed out an left her high an dry an as pretty as a
peach Fred Turner would have taken his chance he said like an
honest man an he was terrible down in the mouth when I saw him
for he was near daft over the gal

Well he was right admitted Matthew after reflection Why
the gal sins so free an easy you might almost fancy her a man

He drew back coughing for Jim came in with a long green log and
laid it on the smouldering fire which glowed crimson under the
heavy smoke

Heres Sol said the young man settling the log with his foot
I told him you were on your way to the house pa but he said he
had only a minute so he came out here

Oh Ive jest been to borrow some Jamaica ginger from Mrs
Weatherby explained Sol Peterkin carefully closing the shutter
after his entrance

My wifes took so bad that Im beginnin to fear shell turn out
as po a bargain as the last Its my luckI always knew I was
illfatedbut Lord amercy hows a man goin to tell the state
of a womans innards from the way she looks on top All the
huggin in the world wont make her wink an eyelash an then
therell crop out heart disease or dropsy befo the year is up
When I think of the trouble I had pickin that thar woman it
makes me downright sick It aint much matter about the colour or
the shape I saida freckled face an a scrawny waist I kin
standonly let it be the quality that wears If you believe it
suh I chose the very ugliest I could find thinkin that the
Lord might be mo willin to overlook heran now this is whats
come of it Shes my fourth too an Ill begin to be a joke
when I go out lookin for a fifth Naw suh if Mary dies pure
shame will keep me a widower to my death

Thar aint but one thing sartain about marriage in my mind
commented Matthew Field an that is that it gits most of its
colour from the distance that comes between The more your mouth
waters for a woman the likelier tis that taint the woman for
youthats my way of thinkin The woman a man dont git somehow
is always the woman he ought to have had Its a curious
mixedup business however you look at it

Thats so said Tom Spade I always noticed it The woman who
is your wife may be a bouncin beauty an the woman who aint
may be as ugly as sin but youd go twice as far to kiss her all
the same Thar is always a sight more spice about the woman who
aint

Jest look at Eliza now pursued Matthew wrapped in the
thought of his own domestic infelicities What I could never
understand about Eliza was that John Sales went clean to the dogs
because he couldnt git her To think of sech a thing happenin
jest as if I was to blame when if Id only known it I could hev
turned about an taken her sister Lizzie Thar were five of em
in all an I settled on Eliza as it was with my eyes
blindfold Poor Johnpoor John It was sech a terrible waste of
wantin

Well its a thing to stiddy about said old Jacob with a
sigh They tell me now that that po young gal of Bill
Fletchers has found it a thorny bed to be sho Her letters are
all bright an pleasant enough they say filled with fine
clothes an the names of strange places but a gentleman who met
her somewhar over thar wrote Fletcher that her husband used her
like a dumb brute

Christopher started and looked up inquiringly

Have you heard anything about that Jim he asked in a queer
voice

Nothin more Fletcher told me he had written to her to come
home but she answered that she would stick to Wyndham for better
or for worse Its a great pitythe marriage promised so well
too

Oh the gals got a big heart I could tell it from her eyes
said old Jacob When you see those dark solemn eyes lookin
out of a pale peaked face it means thars a heart behind em
an a heart that bodes trouble some day whether it be in man or
woman

Christopher passed his hand across his brow and stood staring
vacantly at the smouldering logs He could not tell whether the
news saddened or rejoiced him but at least it brought Marias
image vividly before his eyes The spell of her presence was over
him again and he felt as he had felt on that last evening the
mysterious attraction of her womanhood So intense was the
visionary appeal that it had for the moment almost the effect of
hallucination it was as if she still entreated him across all
the distance The brooding habit of his mind had undoubtedly done
much to conserve his emotion as had the rural isolation in which
he lived In a city life the four years would probably have
blotted out her memory but where comparison was impossible and
lighter distractions almost unheard of what chance was there for
him to forget the single passionate experience he had known
Among his primitive neighbours Maria had flitted for a time like
a bewildering vision then the great distant world had caught her
up into its brightness and the desolate waste country was become
the guardian of the impression she had left

If thars a man who has had bad luck with his children its
Bill Fletcher old Jacob was saying thoughtfully Hes been a
hard man an a mean one too an when he couldnt beg or borrow
its my opinion that he never hesitated to put forth his hand an
steal Thars a powerful lot of judgment in dumb happenins an
when you see a family waste out an run to seed like that it
usually means that the good Lord is havin His way about matters
It takes a mighty sharp eye to tell the difference between
judgment an misfortune an Ive seen enough in this world to
know that no matter how skilfully you twist up good an evil
God Almighty may be a long time in the unravelling but Hell
straighten em out at last Now as to Bill Fletcher his sins got
in the bone an theyre workin out in the blood Look at his son
Billdidnt he come out of the army to drink himself to death
Then his granddaughter Maria has gone an mismarried a somebody
an this boy that hed set his heart on is goin to the devil so
precious fast that he aint got time to look behind him

Oh hes young yet suggested Tom Spade solemnly wagging his
head an Fletcher says you know that hes all right so long
as he keeps clear of Mr Christopher Its Mr Christopher he
swears thats been the ruin of him

Christopher met this with a sneer Why does he let him dog my
footsteps then he inquired with a laugh I never go to the
Hall and yet hes always after me

Bless you suh it aint any question of lettin an thar never
has been sence the boy first put on breeches Why when I refused
to sell him whisky at my sto what did he do but begin smugglin
it out from town Fletcher found it out an blew him skyhigh
but in less than a month it was all goin on agin

An the funny part is said Jim Weatherby that you cant
dislike Will Fletcher however much you try Hes a kindhearted
jolly fellow in spite of the devil

Or in spite of Mr Christopher added Tom with a guffaw

Frowning heavily Christopher turned toward the door

Oh you ask Will Fletcher who is his best friend he said and
let me hear his answer

With an abrupt nod to Jacob he went out of the tobacco barn and
along the little path to the road He had barely reached the
gate however when Jim Weatherby ran after him with the
horseshoes and offered eagerly to come over in the morning and
see that the gray mare was properly shod

Im handy at that kind of thing you know he explained with a
blush

Well if you dont mind I wish you would come Christopher
replied but to save my life I cant see why you are so ready
with other peoples jobs

Then taking the horseshoes he opened the gate and started
rapidly toward home His mind was still absorbed by old Jacobs
news and upon reaching the house he was about to pass up to his
room when Cynthia called him from the little platform beyond the
back door and going out he found her standing pale and tearful
on the kitchen threshold Looking beyond her he saw that Lila
and Tucker were in the room and from the intense and resolute
expression in the younger sisters face he judged that she was
the central figure in what appeared to be a disturbing scene

Christopher you cant imagine what has happened Cynthia began
in her beautiful tragic voice Lila went to church yesterday
with whom do you suppose

Christopher thought for a moment

Not with Bill Fletcher he gave out at last

Come come now its a long ways better than that youll
admit Cynthia broke in Tucker with a peaceful intention I
cant help reminding you my dear to be thankful that it wasnt
so unlikely a person as Bill Fletcher

With a decisive gesture such as he had never believed her capable
of Lila came up to Christopher and stood facing him with beaming
eyes He had never before seen her so lovely and he realised at
the instant that it was this she had always needed to complete
her beauty From something merely white and warm and delicate she
had become suddenly as radiant as a flame

I went with Jim Weatherby Christopher she said slowly and
Im not ashamed of it

The admission wrung a short groan from Cynthia who stood
twisting her gingham apron tightly about her fingers

Oh Lila who was his grandfather she cried Well theres
this thing certain she doesnt want to marry his grandfather
put in Tucker undaunted by the failure of his former attempts at
peacemaking Not that I have anything against the old chap for
that matter he was an honest wellbehaved old body and used to
mend my boots for me up to the day of his death Jim gets his
handy ways from him I reckon

Cynthia turned upon him angrily

Uncle Tucker you will drive me mad she exclaimed the tears
starting to her lashes It does seem to me that you at least
might show some consideration for the family name Its all weve
left

And its a good enough relic in its way returned Tucker
amicably though if you are going to make a business of
sacrificing yourself for heavens sake let it be for something
bigger than a relic A live neighbour is a much better thing to
make sacrifices for than a dead grandfather

I dont care one bit what his grandfather was or whether he ever
had any or not cried Lila in an outburst of indignation and
more than that I dont care what mine was either I am going to
marry himI amI am Dont look at me like that Cynthia Do
you want to spoil my whole life

Cynthia threw out her hands with a despairing grasp of the air
as if she were reaching for the broken remnants of the family
pride To marry a Weatherby she gasped Oh mother mother
Lila is it possible that you can be so selfish But Lila had
won her freedom too dearly to surrender it to an appeal

I want to be selfish she said stubbornly I have never been
selfish in my life and I want to see what it feels like Oh you
are cruel all of you and you will break my heart

Christophers face paled and grew stern

We must all think of mothers wishes Lila he said gravely

For the first time the girl lost her high fortitude and a
babyish quiver shook her lips Her glance wavered and fell and
with a pathetic gesture she turned from Christopher to Cynthia
and from Cynthia to Tucker

Oh you cant understand Christopher she cried you have
never been in love nor has Cynthia None of you can understand
but Uncle Tucker

She ran to him sobbing and he steadying himself on a single
crutch folded his arm about her

I understand child thank God he said softly



CHAPTER II Between Christopher and Will

An hour later Christopher was at work in the stable when he
heard a careless whistle outside and Will Fletcher looked in at
the open door

I say Chris take a turn off and come down to Tom Spades he
urged

Christopher who was descending from the loft with an armful of
straw paused midway of the ladder and regarded his visitor with
perceptible hesitation

I cant this evening he answered the light is almost gone
and Ive a good deal to get through with after dark Ill manage
better tomorrow if I can By the way why didnt you show up at
Weatherbys

Will came in and sat down on the edge of a big wooden box which
contained the harness In the four years he had changed but
little in appearance though his slim figure had shot up rapidly
in height His chestnut hair grew in high peaks from his temples
and swept in a single lock above his small sparkling eyes which
held an expression of intelligent animation On the whole it was
not an unpleasing face despite the tremulous droop of the mouth
already darkened by the faint beginning of a brown mustache

Oh Molly Peterkin stopped me in the road he replied readily
Id caught her eye once or twice before but this was the first
chance wed had to speak I tell you shes a peach Christopher

Christopher came down from the ladder and spread the straw evenly
in the horses stalls

So they say he responded but I havent much of an eye for
women you know Now when it comes to judging a leaf of tobacco
Im a match for any man

Well one cant be everything remarked Will consolingly He
snatched at a piece of straw that had fallen on the lowest rung
of the ladder and began idly chewing it As for me I know a
blamed sight more about women than I do about tobacco he added
with a swagger

Christopher glanced up and at sight of the boyish figure burst
into a hearty laugh

Oh youre a jolly old sport I know and to think that Tom
Spade has been accusing me of leading you astray Why you are
already twice the man that I am

Pshaw Thats just grandpas chatter The old man rails at me
day and night about you until its a mortal wonder he doesnt
drive me to the dogs outright Id like to see another fellow
that would put up with it for a week Captain Morrison told him
you know that I hadnt done a peg of study for a year and it
brought on a scene that almost shook the roof Now he swears Im
to go to the university next fall or hang

Well Id go by all means

What under heaven could I do there All those confounded
languages Morrison poured into my head havent left so much as a
single letter of the alphabet Ad nauseam is all I learned of
Latin I tell you Id rather be a storekeeper any time than a
scholarbooks make me sick all overand when it comes to that
I dont believe I know much more today than you do

A smile crossed Christophers face leaving it very grim The
words recalled to him his own earlier ambitionthat of the
gentlemanly scholar of the old orderand there flickered before
his eyes the visionary library suffused with firelight and the
translation of the Iliad he had meant to finish

I always told you it wasnt worth anything he said roughly
Shed love you any better if you could spurt Greek

Will broke into a pleased laugh his mind dwelling upon the fancy
the other had conjured up so skilfully

Did you ever see such lips in your life he inquired

Christopher shook his head I havent noticed them but Sols
have a way of sticking in my memory

Oh you brute Its a shame that she should have such a father
Hes about the worst I ever met

Some think the shame is on the other side you know

Thats a lieshe told me so Fred Turner started the whole
thing because she refused to marry him at the last moment She
found out suddenly that she wasnt in love with him Girls are
like that you see Why Maria Christopher looked up quickly
Ive nothing to do with your sister he observed I know that
but its true all the same Maria couldnt tell her own mind any
better Why one day she was declaring that she was over head and
ears in love with Jack and the next she was wringing her hands
and begging him to go away What are you going to do down at
the store asked Christopher abruptly Oh nothing in
particularjust lounge I suppose theres never anything to do
By the way cant we have a hunt tomorrow Ill see about it
Look here is your grandfather any worse than usual He stormed
at me like mad yesterday because I wouldnt turn my team of oxen
out of the road Its like blasting rock to get a decent word
out of him The only time hes been goodhumoured for four years
was the week we were away together He offered me five thousand
dollars down if Id never speak to you again You dont say
so exclaimed Christopher He bent his head and stood looking
thoughtfully at the matted straw under foot Well you had a
chance to turn a pretty penny he said in a tone of gentle
raillery Oh hang it What do you mean demanded Will Of
course I wasnt going back on you like that just to please
grandpa Id have been a confounded sneak if I had Youre a
jolly good chap and no mistake But the old man would have been
pleased I reckon Will grinned

You bet he would I could twist him round my finger but for you
Aunt Saidie says It will be all the same in the end though
The whole thing will come to you some day Oh yes Maria got
her share and Wyndham has made ducks and drakes of it Your
grandfathers aging too isnt he

Rather returned Will with a curious mixture of amiable
lightness and cool brutality Hes gone off at least twenty
years since that time I had pneumonia in your barn That wrecked
him Aunt Saidie says and all because he knew hed have to put
up with you when the doctor told him to let me have my way His
temper gets worse too all the time I declare he sometimes
makes me wish he were dead and buried Oh hell live long
enough yet never fearthose wiry crossgrained people are as
tough as lightwood knots Its a pity though he wants to bully
you like thatit would kill me in a day A flush mounted to
Wills forehead I knew youd think so he said and its what
I tell him all the time Hes got no business meddling with me so
much and I wont stand it He ought to get a dog suggested
Christopher indifferently Well Im not a dog and Ill make
him understand it yet Oh you think Im an awful milksop of
course but Ill show you otherwise some day Id like to know if
you could have done any better in my place Done Why I
shouldnt have been in your place long thats all I shant
either for that matter but Ive got to humour him a little you
see because he holds the pursestrings Hed never go so far
as to kick you out would he Well hardly Im all he has you
know He doesnt like Maria because of her fine airs much as he
thinks of education Ive got to be a gentleman he says but as
for him he wouldnt give up one of his vulgar habits to save
anybodys soul His trouble with Maria all came of her reproving
him for drinking out of his saucer Now I dont mind that kind
of thing so much but Maria used to say shed rather have him
steal any day than gulp his coffee Why are you laughing so
Oh nothing Are you going to Toms now Ive got to work Will
slid down from the big box and sauntered toward the door pausing
on the little wooden step to light a cigarette Drop in if you
get a chance he threw back over his shoulder with a puff of
smoke In a few moments Christopher finished his work and
coming
outside closed the stable door Then he walked a few paces along
the little path stopping from time to time to gaze across the
darkening landscape A light mist was wreathed about the tops of
the old lilacbushes where it glimmered so indistinctly that it
seemed as if one might dispel it by a breath and farther away
the soft evening colours had settled over the great fields
beyond which a clear yellow line was just visible above the
distant woods The wind was sharp with an edge of frost and as
it blew into his face he raised his head and drank long
invigorating drafts From the cattlepen hard by he smelled the
fresh breath of the cows and around him were those other odours
vague familiar pleasant which are loosened at twilight in the
open country The time had been when the mere physical contact
with the air would have filled him with a quiet satisfaction but
during the last four years he had lost gradually his
sensitiveness to external thingsto the changes of the seasons
as to the beauties of an autumn sunrise A clear morning had
ceased to arouse in him the old buoyant energy and he had lost
the zest of muscular exertion which had done so much to sweeten
his labour in the fields It was as if a clog fettered his
simplest no less than his greatest emotion and his enjoyment of
nature had grown dull and spiritless like his affection for his
family With his sisters he was aware that a curious constraint
had become apparent and it was no longer possible for him to
meet his mother with the gay deference she still exacted There
were times even when he grew almost suspicious of Cynthias
patience and at such moments his irritation was manifested in a
sullen reserve To himself he could give no explanation of his
state of mind he knew merely that he retreated day by day
farther into the shadow of his loneliness and that while in his
heart he still craved human sympathy an expression of it even
from those he loved was above all the thing he most bitterly
resented A light flashed in the kitchen and he went on slowly
toward the house As he reached the back porch he saw that Lila
was sitting at the kitchen window looking wearily out into the
dusk The firelight scintillated in her eyes and as she turned
quickly at a sound within the room he noticed with a pang that
the sparkles were caused by teardrops on her lashes His heart
quickened at the sight of her drooping figure and an impulse
seized him to go in and comfort her at any cost Then his severe
constraint laid an icy hold upon him and he hesitated with his
hand upon the door

If I go in and speak to her what is there for me to say he
thought overcome by his horror of any uncontrolled emotion We
will merely go over the old complaints the endless explanations
She will probably weep like a child and I shall feel a brute
when I look on and keep silent In the first place if I speak to
her what is there for me to say If I simply beg her to stop
crying or if I rush in and urge her to marry Jim Weatherby
tomorrow what good can come of either course She doesnt wait
for my consent to the marriage for she is as old as I am and
knows her own heart much better than I know mine It is true that
she is too beautiful to waste away like this but how can I
prevent it or what is there for me to do

Again came the impulse to go in and fold her in his arms but
before he had taken the first step he yielded as always to his
strange reserve and he realised that if he entered it would be
but to assume his customary unconcern from the shelter of which
he would probably make a few commonplace remarks on trivial
subjects The emotional situation would be ignored by them all
he knew they would treat it absolutely as if it had no
existence as if its voice was not speaking to them in the
silence and they would break their bread and drink their coffee
in apparent unconsciousness that supper was not the single thing
that engrossed their thoughts And all the time they would be
face to face with the knowledge that they had demanded that Lila
should sacrifice her life

Presently Cynthia came out and called him and he went in
carelessly and sat down at the table Lila left the window and
slipped into her place and when Tucker joined them she cut up
his food as usual and prepared his coffee

Uncle Tuckers cup has no handle Cynthia she said with
concern Let me take this one and give him another

Well I never exclaimed Cynthia bending over to examine the
break with her nearsighted squint Well soon have to begin
using Aunt Susannahs set if this keeps up Uncle Boaz youve
broken another cup today

Her tone was sharp with irritation and the fine wrinkles caused
by ceaseless small worries appeared instantly between her
eyebrows Christopher watching her remembered that she had worn
the same expression during the scene with Lila and it annoyed
him unspeakably that she should be able to descend so readily
and with equal energy upon so insignificant a grievance as a bit
of broken china

Uncle Boaz hobbled round the table and peered contemptuously at
the cup which Lila held

Dar warn no use bruckin dat ar one he observed caze twuz
bruck aready  Oh there wont be a piece left presently
pursued Cynthia indignantly and Christopher felt suddenly that
there was something contemptible in the passion she expended upon
trifles He wondered if Tucker noticed how horribly petty it all
was to lament a broken cup when the tears were hardly dried on
Lilas cheeks Finishing hurriedly he pushed back his chair and
rose from the table shaking his head in response to Cynthias
request that he should go in to see his mother Not now he
said impatiently with that nervous avoidance of the person he
loved best Ill be back in time to carry her to bed but Ive
got to take a halfhour off and look in on Tom Spade She
really ought to go to bed before sundown responded Cynthia
but nothing under heaven will persuade her to do so Its her
wonderful will that keeps her alive just as it keeps her sitting
bolt upright in that old chair I dont believe theres another
woman on earth who could have done it for more than twenty
years Taking down his hat from a big nail in the wall
Christopher stood for a moment abstractedly fingering the brim
Well Ill be back shortly he said at last and went out
hurriedly into the darkness At the instant he could not tell why
he had so suddenly decided to follow Will Fletcher to the store
but as usual when the impulse came to him he proceeded to act
promptly as it directed Strangely enough the boy was the one
human being whom he felt no inclination to avoid and the least
oppressive moments that he knew were the reckless ones they spent
together While his daily companion was mentally and morally upon
a lower plane than his own the association was not without a
balm for his wounded pride and the knowledge that it was still
possible to assume superiority to Fletchers heir was so far as
he himself admitted the one consolation that his life contained
As for his feeling toward Will Fletcher as an individual it was
the outcome of so curious a mixture of attraction and repulsion
that he had long ceased from any attempt to define it as pure
emotion For the last four years the boy had been as Tom Spade
put it the very shadow on the mans footsteps and yet at the
end of that time it was almost impossible for Christopher to
acknowledge either his liking or his hatred He had suffered him
for his own end that was all and he had come at last almost to
enjoy the tolerance that he displayed The hero worshipthe
natural imitation of youth was at least not unpleasant and
there had been days during a brief absence of the boy when
Christopher had to his surprise become aware of a positive
vacancy in his surroundings So long as Will made no evident
attempt to rise above himso long indeed as Fletchers
grandson kept to Fletchers level it was possible that the
companionship would continue as harmoniously as it had begun In
the store he found Tom Spade and his wifean angular
strongfeatured woman in purple calico who carried off the
reputation of a shrew with noisy honours When he asked for Will
the storekeeper turned from the cashdrawer which he was emptying
and nodded toward the halfopen door of the adjoining room

Several of the young fellows are in thar now he remarked
offhand an Ive jest had to go in an git between Fred Turner
an Will Fletcher They came to out an out blows an I had to
shake em both by the scuff of thar necks befo theyd hish

snarlin Bless yo life all about a woman too every last word
of it Well well meanin no disrespect to you Susan its a
queer thing that a man cant be born married or buried without
a woman gittin herself mixed up in the business If she aint
wrappin you in swaddlin bands you may be sho shes measurin
off yo windinsheet Mark my words Mr Christopher I dont
believe thars ever been a fight fought on this earthbe it a
battle or a plain fisticuffthat it warnt started in the brain
of somebodys mother wife or sweetheart an its most likely to
have been the sweetheart It is strange when you come to study
bout it how sech peaceablelookin creaturs as women kin have
sech hearty appetites for trouble

Well trouble may be born of a woman but it generally manages
to take the shape of a man observed Mrs Spade from behind the
counter where she was filling a big glass jar with a fresh
supply of striped peppermint candy And as far as that goes
ever sence the Garden of Eden men have taken a good deal mo
pleasure in layin the blame on thar wives than they do in layin
blows on the devil Its a fortunate woman that dont wake up the
day after the weddin an find shes married an Adam instid of a
man However they are as the Lord made em I reckon she
finished charitably which aint so much to thar credit as it
sounds seein they could have done over sech a po job with
precious little trouble

Oh I warnt aimin at you Susan Tom hastened to assure her
aware from experience that he entered an argument only to be
worsted Youve been a good wife to me for all yo sharp
tongue an Ive never had to git up an light the fire sence the
day I married you Yes youve been a firstrate wife to me an
no mistake

Im the last person you need tell that to was Mrs Spades
retort I dont reckon Ive biled inside an sweated outside
for mo than twenty years without knowin it Lord Lord If it
took as hard work to be a Christian as it does to be a wife
thard be mighty few but men in the next worldan theyd git
thar jest by followin like sheep arter Adam

I declar Susan I didnt mean to rile you urged Tom
breaking in upon the flow of words with an appealing effort to
divert its course I was merely crackin a joke with Mr
Christopher you know

Im plum sick of these here jokes thats got to have a woman on
the pint of em returned Mrs Spade tightly screwing on the
top of the glass jar Ive always noticed that thar aint
nothin so funny in this world but it gits a long sight funnier
if a man kin turn it on his wife

Now my dear helplessly expostulated Tom

My names Susan Tom Spade an Ill have you call me by it or
not at all If thars one thing I hate on this earth its a
dear in the mouth of a married man that ought to know better
Id every bit as lief youd shoot a lizard at me an you aint
jest found it out If you think Im the kind of person to git any
satisfaction out of improper speeches you were never mo mistaken
in yo life an I kin pint out to you right now that I aint
never heard one of them words yit that I aint had to pay for it
A dear the mo is mighty apt to mean a bucket of water the
less Oh you cant turn my head with yo soft tricks Tom Spade
Im a respectable woman as my mother was befo me an I dont
want familiar doins from any man alive or dead The woman who
does whether she be married or single aint no better than a
femalethats my opinion

She paused to draw breath and Tom was quick to take advantage of
the intermission Good Lord Mr Christopher those darn young
fools are at it agin  he exclaimed darting toward the
adjoining room

With a stride Christopher pushed past him and opening the door
stopped uncertainly upon the threshold

At the first glance he saw that the trouble was between Will and
Fred Turner and that Will because of his slighter weight had
got very much the worst of the encounter The boy stood now
trembling with anger and bleeding at the mouth beside an
overturned table while Freda stout brawny fellowwas busily
pummelling his shoulders

Youre a sneakin punylivered liar thats what you are
finished Turner with a vengeance

Christopher walked leisurely across the room

And youre another he observed in a quiet voicethe voice of
his courtly father which always came to him in moments of white
heat You are exactly thata sneaking punylivered liar His
manner was so courteous that it came as a surprise when he struck
out from the shoulder and felled Fred as easily as he might have
knocked over a wooden tenpin You really must learn better
manners he remarked coolly looking down upon him

Then he wiped his brow on his blue shirtsleeve and called for a
glass of beer



Chapter III Mrs Blake Speaks her Mind on Several Matters

Breakfast was barely over the next morning when Jim Weatherby
appeared at the kitchen door carrying a package of horseshoe
nails and a small hammer

I thought perhaps Christopher might want to use the mare early
he explained to Cynthia who was clearing off the table There
was a pleasant precision in his speech acquired with much
industry at the little country school and Cynthia despite her
rigid disfavour could not but notice that when he glanced round
the room in search of Lila he displayed the advantage of an
aristocratic profile Until today she could not remember that
she had ever seen him directly as it were she had looked around
him and beyond him much as she might have obliterated from her
vision a familiar shrub that chanced to intrude itself into her
point of view The immediate result of her examination was the
possibility she dimly acknowledged that a man might exist as a
wellfavoured individual and yet belong to an unquestionably
lower class of life

Well Ill go out to the stable added Jim after a moment in
which he had patiently submitted to her squinting observation
Christopher will be somewhere about I suppose

Oh I suppose so replied Cynthia indifferently emptying the
coffeegrounds into the kitchen sink The asperity of her tone
was caused by the entrance of Lila who came in with a basin of
cornmeal dough tucked under her bared arm which showed as round
and delicate as a childs beneath her loosely rolledup sleeve

Cynthia I cant find the henhouse key she began and then
catching sight of Jim she flushed a clear pink while the little
brown mole ran a race with the dimple in her check

The key is on that nail beside the dried hops returned Cynthia
sternly I found it in the lock last night and brought it in
Its a mercy that the chickens werent all stolen

Without replying Lila took down the key strung it on her little
finger and going to the door passed with Jim out into the
autumn sunshine Her soft laugh pulsed back presently and
Cynthia hearing it set her thin lips tightly as she carefully
rinsed the coffeepot with soda

Christopher who had just come up to the wellbrink where Tucker
sat feeding the hounds from a plate of scraps gave an abrupt nod
in the direction of the lovers strolling slowly down the
henhouse path

It will end that way some day I reckon he said with a sigh
and you know Im almost of a mind with Cynthia about it It does
seem a downright pity Not that Jim isnt a good chap and all
that but hes an honest hardworking farmer and nothing more
and good heavens just look at Lila Why shes beautiful enough
to set the world afire

Smiling broadly Tucker tossed a scrap of cornbread into Spys
open jaws then his gaze travelled leisurely to the henhouse
which Lila had just unlocked As she pushed back the door there
was a wild flutter of wings and the big fowls flew in a swarm
about her feet one great redandblack rooster craning his long
neck after the basin she held beneath her arm While she
scattered the soft dough on the ground she bent her head slightly
sideways looking up at Jim who stood regarding her with
enraptured eyes

Well I dont know that much good ever comes of setting anything
afire answered Tucker with his amiable chuckle the danger is
that youre apt to cause a good deal of trouble somewhere and
its more than likely youll get singed yourself in putting out
the flame You neednt worry about Lila Christopher shes the
kind of womanand theyre rarewho doesnt have to have her
happiness made to order give her any fair amount of the raw
material and shell soon manage to fit it perfectly to herself
The stuff is in her I tell you the atmosphere is about her
cant you feel itand shes going to be happy whatever comes
A woman who can make over a dress the sixth time as cheerfully as
she did the first has the spirit of a Caesar and doesnt need
your lamentations If you want to be a Jeremiah you must go
elsewhere

Oh I dare say shell grow content but it does seem such a
terrible waste Shes the image of that SaintMemin portrait of
Aunt Susannah and if shed only been born a couple of
generations ago she would probably have been the belle of two
continents Such women must be scarce anywhere

Shes pretty enough certainly and I think Jim knows it
Theres but one thing Ive ever seen that could compare with her
for colour and thats a damask rose that blooms in May on an old
bush in the front yard When all is said however that young
Weatherby is no clodhopper you know and Im not sure that he
isnt worthier of her than any highsounding somebody across the
water would have been He can love twice as hard Ill wager and
thats the chief thing after all its worth more than big
titles or fine clothesor even than dead grandfathers with due
respect to Cynthia I tell you Lila may never stir from the
midst of these tobacco fields she may be buried alive all her
days between these muddy roads that lead heaven knows where and
yet she may live a lot bigger and fuller life than she might have
done with all London at her feet as they say it was at your
Greataunt Susannahs The person who has to have outside props to
keep him straight must have been made mighty crooked at the
start and Lilas not like that

Christopher stooped and pulled Spys ears

Thats as good a way to look at it as any other I reckon he
remarked and now Ive got to hurry the shoeing of the mare

He crossed over and joined Lila and Jim before the henhouse door
where he put the big fowls to noisy flight

Well youre a trusty neighbour  he cried goodhumoredly
striking Jim a friendly blow that sent him reeling out into the
path

Lila passed her hand in a sweeping movement round the inside of
the basin and flirted the last drops of dough from her
fingertips

A few of your pats will cripple Jim for a week she observed
so youd better be careful hes too useful a friend to lose
while there are any jobs to do

Why if I had that muscle I could run a farm with one hand
said Jim Give a plough a single push Christopher and I
believe it would run as long as there was level ground

Cynthia standing at the kitchen window with a cuptowel slung
across her arm watched the three chatting merrily in the
sunshine and the look of rigid resentment settled like a mask
upon her face She was still gazing out upon them when Docia
opened the door behind her and informed her in a whisper that
Ole miss wanted her moughty quick

All right Docia Is anything the matter

Nawm tain nuttin tall de matter Shes des got fidgetty

Well Ill come in a minute Are you better today Hows your
heart

Lawd Miss Cynthia hits des bruised all over Evy breaf I
draw hits it plum like a hammer I hyear hit thump thump thump
all de blessed time

Be careful then Tell mother Im coming at once

She hung the cuptowel on the rack and taking off her blue
checked apron went along the little platform to the main part of
the house and into the old ladys parlour where the morning
sunshine fell across the faces of generations of dead Blakes The
room was still furnished with the old rosewood furniture and the
old damask curtains hung before the single window which gave on
the overgrown front yard and the twisted aspen Though the rest
of the house suggested only the direst poverty the immediate
surroundings of Mrs Blake revealed everywhere the lavish ease so
characteristic of the old order which had passed away The
carving on the desk on the bookcases on the slender sofa was
all wrought by tedious handwork the delicate damask coverings to
the chairs were still lustrous after almost half a century and
the few vases scattered here and there and filled with autumn
flowers were for the most part rare pieces of old royal
Worcester While it was yet Indian summer there was no need of
fires and the big fireplace was filled with goldenrod which
shed a yellow dust down on the rude brick hearth

The old lady inspired by her indomitable energy was already
dressed for the day in her black brocade and sat bolt upright
among the pillows in her great oak chair

Some one passed the window whistling Cynthia Who was it The
whistle had a pleasant cheery sound

It must have been Jim Weatherby I think old Jacobs son

Is he over here

To see Christopheryes

Well be sure to remind the servants to give him something to
eat in the kitchen before he goes back and I think if hes a
decent young man I should like to have a little talk with him
about his family His father used to be one of our most
respectable labourers

It would tire you I fear mother Shall I give you your
knitting now

You have a most peculiar idea about me my child I have not yet
reached my dotage and I dont think that a little talk with
young Weatherby could possibly be much of an ordeal Is he an
improper person

No no of course not you shall see him whenever you like I
was only thinking of you

Well Im sure I am very grateful for your consideration my
dear but there are times occasionally you know when it is
better for one to judge for oneself I sometimes think that your
only fault Cynthia is that you are a littlejust a very little
bit you understandinclined to manage things too much Your
poor father used to say that a domineering woman was like a
kicking cow but this doesnt apply to you of course

Shall I call Jim now mother

You might as well dear Place a chair for him a good stout
one and be sure to make him wipe his feet before he comes in
Does he appear to be clean

Oh perfectly

I remember his father always wasunusually so for a common
labourer Those people sometimes smell of cattle you know and
besides my nose has grown extremely sensitive in the years since
I lost my eyesight Perhaps it would be as well to hand me the
bottle of camphor I can pretend I have a headache

Theres no need really he isnt a labourer at all you know
and he looks quite a gentleman He is I believe considered a
very handsome young man

Mrs Blake waved toward the door and the piece of purple glass
flashed in the sunlight In that case I might offer him some
sensible advice she said The Weatherbys I remember always
showed a very proper respect for gentle people I distinctly
recall how well Jacob behaved when on one occasion Micajah
Blaira dreadful dissolute character though of a very old
family and an intimate friend of your fatherstook decidedly
too much eggnog one Christmas when he was visiting us and
insisted upon biting Jacobs cheek because it looked so like a
winesap Jacob had come to see your father on business and I
will say that he displayed a great deal of good sense and
dignity he said afterward that he didnt mind the bite on his
cheek at all but that it pained him terribly to see a Virginia
gentleman who couldnt balance a bowl of eggnog Well well
Micajah was certainly a rake I fear and for that matter so was
his father before him

Father had queer friends observed Cynthia sadly I remember
his telling me when I was a little girl that he preferred that
family to any in the county

Oh the family was all right my dear I never heard a breath
against the women Now you may fetch Jacob Is that his name

No Jim

Dear me thats very odd He certainly should have been called
after his father I wonder how they could have been so
thoughtless

Cynthia drew forward an armchair stooped and carefully arranged
the ottoman and then went with stern determination to look for
Jim Weatherby

He was sitting in the stable doorway fitting a shoe on the old
mare while Lila leaned against an overturned barrel in the
sunshine outside At Cynthias sudden appearance they both
started and looked up in amazement the words dying slowly on
their lips

Why whatever is the matter Cynthia cried Lila as if in
terror

Cynthia came forward until she stood directly at the mares head
where she delivered her message with a gasp

Mother insists upon talking to Jim Theres no help for it he
must come

Weatherby dropped the mares hoof and raised a breathless
question to Cynthias face while Lila asked quickly

Does she know

Know what demanded Cynthia turning grimly upon her Of
course she knows that Jim is his fathers son

The young man rose and laid the hammer down on the overturned
barrel then he led the mare back to her stall and coming out
again washed his hands in a tub of water by the door

Well Im ready he observed quietly Shall I go in alone

Oh we dont ask that of you said Lila laughing Come Ill
take you She slipped her hand under his arm and they went gaily
toward the house leaving Cynthia to pick up the horseshoe nails
lying loose upon the ground

Hearing the young mans step on the threshold Mrs Blake turned
her head with a smile of pleasant condescension and stretched out
her delicate yellowed hand

This is Jim Weatherby mother said Lila in her softest voice
Cynthia says you want to talk to him

I know my child I know returned Mrs Blake with an animated
gesture Come in Jim and dont trouble to stand Find him a
chair Lila I knew your father long before you were born she
added turning to the young man and I knew only good of him I
suppose he has often told you of the years he worked for us

Jim held her hand for an instant in his own and then bending
over raised it to his lips

My father never tires of telling us about the old times and
about Mr Blake and yourself he answered in his precise
English and with the simple dignity which he never lost Lila
watching him prayed silently that a miracle might open the old
ladys eyes and allow her to see the kind manly look upon his
face

Mrs Blake nodded pleasantly with evident desire to put him
wholly at his ease

Well his son is becoming quite courtly she responded
smiling and I know Jacob is proud of youor he ought to be
which amounts to the same thing Theres nothing I like better
than to see a good hardworking family prosper in life and raise
its station Not that I mean to put ideas into your head of
course for it is a ridiculous sight to see a person dissatisfied
with the position in which the good Lord has placed him That was
what I always liked about your mother and I remember very well
her refusing to wear some of my old finery when she was married
on the ground that she was a plain honest woman and wanted to
continue so when she was a wife I hope by the way that she is
well

Oh quite She does not walk much though her joints have been
troubling her

To Lilas surprise he was not the least embarrassed by the
personal tone of the conversation and his sparkling blue eyes
held their usual expression of blithe goodhumour

Indeed Mrs Blake pricked at the subject in her sprightly way
Well you must persuade her to use a liniment of Jamestown weed
steeped in whisky There is positively nothing like it for
rheumatism Lila do we still make it for the servants If so
you might send Sarah Weatherby a bottle

Ill see about it mother Arent you tired Shall I take Jim
away

Not just yet child I am interested in seeing what a promising
young man he has become How old are you Jim

Twentynine next February There are two of us you knowIve a
sister Molly She married Frank Granger and moved ten miles
away

Ah that brings me to the very point I was driving at Above all
things let me caution you most earnestly against the reckless
marriages so common in your station of life For heavens sake
dont marry a woman because she has a pretty face and you cherish
an impracticable sentiment for her If you take my advice you
will found your marriage upon mutual respect and industry Select
a wife who is not afraid of work and who expects no folderol of
romance Lovemaking Ive always maintained should be the
pastime of the leisure class exclusively

Im not afraid of work myself replied Jim laughing as he
looked boldly into the old ladys sightless eyes but Id never
stand it for my wifenot aa lick of it

Tut tut Your mother does it

Jim nodded But Im not my father he mildly suggested

Well youre a fine headstrong young fool and I like you all
the better for it declared Mrs Blake You may go now because
I feel as if I needed a doze but be sure to come in and see me
the next time youre over here Lila put the cat on my knees and
straighten my pillows

Lila lifted the cat from the rug and placed it in the old ladys
lap then as she arranged the soft white pillows she bent over
suddenly and kissed the piece of purple glass on the fragile
hand



Chapter IV In Which Christopher Hesitates

Following his impulsive blow in defense of Will Fletcher
Christopher experienced almost with his next breath a reaction
in his feeling for the boy and meeting him two days later at the
door of the tobacco barn he fell at once into a tone of
contemptuous raillery

So you let Fred smash you up eh he observed with a sneer

Will flushed

Oh you neednt talk like that he answered hes the biggest
man about here except you By the way youre a bully friend to a
fellow you know and its not a particle of use pretending you
dont like me because you cant help hitting back jolly quick
when anybody undertakes to give me a licking

Why were you such a fool as to go at him inquired Christopher
glancing up at his evenly hanging rows of tobacco and then
coming outside to lock the door Youll never get a reputation
as a fighter if you are always jumping on men over your own size
Now next time I should advise you to try your spirit on Sol
Peterkin

Oh it was all about Molly explained Will frankly I told
Fred that he was a big blackguard to use the girl so and then he
called me a whitelivered liar

I heard him remarked Christopher quietly

Well I dont care what he sayshe is a blackguard Im glad
you knocked him down too it was no more than he deserved

I didnt do it on Molly Peterkins account you know Tobacco
takes up quite enough of my time without my entering the lists as
a champion of light women But if you arent man enough to fight
your own battles I suppose Ill have to keep my muscle in proper
shape

Will smarted from the words and the corners of his mouth took a
dogged droop

I dont see how you expect me to be a match for Fred Turner he
returned angrily

Why I dont expect it replied Christopher coolly as he
turned the key in the padlock drew it out and slipped it into
his pocket I expect you merely to keep away from him thats
all

Will stared at him in perplexity What a devil of a humour you
are in he exclaimed

Am I Christopher broke into a laugh You are accustomed to
the sunny temper of your grandfather How is he today In his
usual cheerful vein

Oh hes awful answered the boy relieved at the change of
subject If you could only have heard him yesterday Somebody
told him about the fight at the store and as luck would have
it he found out that Molly Peterkin was at the bottom of it all
When he called me into his room and locked the door I knew
something was up and sure enough we had blood and thunder for
two mortal hours He threatened to sell the horses and the
hounds and to put me at the plough if I ever so much as looked
at the girl againgal he called her and a brazen wench
That is the way he talks you know

I know Christopher nodded gravely

But the funny part is that the thing that made him hottest was
your knocking over Fred Turner That he simply couldnt stand
Why hed have paid Fred fifty dollars down to thrash me black
and blue he said He called youOh he has a great store of pet
names

What asked Christopher for the other caught himself up
suddenly

Nothing muchhes always doing it you know

You neednt trouble yourself on my account Im familiar with
his use of words

Oh he called you a crazy pauper who ought to be in gaol

He did did he Well for once in his life he drew it mild
Then he gave a long whistle and kicked away a rock in the path 
A crazy pauper who ought to be in gaol Ive a pretty
goodsized debt to settle with your grandfather when I come to
think of it

Just suppose you were in my place now insisted Will Then I
reckon youd have cause forswearing sure enough I tell you I
couldnt get out of that room yesterday until I promised him Id
turn over a new leafthat Id start in with Mr Morrison
tomorrow and dig away at Latin and Greek until I go to the
university next fall

Christopher turned quickly

Tomorrow he repeated Why thats the day I had planned wed
go hunting Make Morrisons Friday

The boy wavered

Cant we go another day he asked Hes so awfully set on
tomorrow Id have to be mighty sharp to fool him again

Oh well but its the only day Ive free Theres a lot of fall
ploughing to do then the apples are ready to be gathered and I
must take some corn to the mill before the weeks up Ive wasted
too much time with you as it is Its the only wealth I have you
see

Then Ill goIll go declared Will jumping to a decision
Therell be a terrific fuss if he finds it out but perhaps he
wont Ill bring my gun over to the barn tonight and get
Zebbadee to meet us with the hounds at the bend in the road
Well I must get back now I dont want him to suspect Ive seen
you today

He started off at a rapid pace and Christopher turning in the
other direction went to bring the horses from the distant
pasture It was a mellow afternoon and a golden haze wrapped the
broad meadow filled with autumn wild flowers and the little
brickedup graveyard on the low green hill As he swung himself
over the bars at the end of the path he saw Lila and Jim
Weatherby gathering goldenrod in the center of the field When
they caught sight of him Jim laid his handful of blossoms in a
big basket on the ground and came to join him on his way to the
pasture

They are for Mrs Blakes fireplace he remarked with a
friendly smile as he glanced back at Lila standing kneedeep
amid the October flowers

Its a queer idea observed Christopher finding himself at a
loss for a reply

Jim strolled on leisurely snatching at the heads of wild carrot
as he passed

Theres something Ive wanted to tell you Christopher he said
after a moment turning his pleasant manly face upon the other

Is that so asked Christopher with a sudden desire to avert
the impending responsibility Oh but I hardly think Im the
proper person  he added laughing

Jim met his eyes squarely

Im a plain man he said slowly and though Im not ashamed of
it I know of course that my family have always been plain
people As things are I had no business on earth to fall in love
with your sister but all the same its what Ive gone and done

Christopher nodded and walked on

Well I suppose its what I should have done too in your
place he returned quietly

Ive reproached myself for it often enough pursued Jim but
when all is said how can a man prevent a thing like that I
might as well try to shut my eyes to the sun when it is shining
straight on me Why everybody else seems dull and lifeless when
I look at herand I seem such a brute myself that I hardly dare
touch her hand All I ask is to be her servant until I die

It took courage to speak such words and Christopher knowing it
stopped midway of the little path and regarded Jim with the rare
smile which gave a boyish brightness to his face

By George you are a trump he said heartily And as far as
that goes youre good enough for Lila or for anybody else It
isnt that you see its only

I know finished Jim quietly and without resentment its my
grandfather Your sister Cynthia told me and I reckon its all
natural but somehow I cant make myself ashamed of the old man
nor is Lila for that matter He was an honest upright body as
ever you saw and he never did a mean thing in his life though
he lived to be almost ninety

Youre right said Christopher flushing suddenly and as far
as Im concerned Id let Lila marry you tomorrow but as for
mother she would simply never consent The idea would be
impossible to her and we could never explain things you must
see that yourself

I see replied Jim readily but the main point is that you
yourself would have no objection to our marriage provided it
were possible

Not a bit not a bit

He held out his hand and Jim shook it warmly before he picked up
his basket and went to rejoin Lila

Turning in the path Christopher saw the girl who was sitting
alone on the lowered bars rise and wave a spray of goldenrod
above her head Then as the lovers met she laid her hand upon
Jims arm and lifted her glowing face as if to read his words
before he uttered them Something in the happy surrender of her
gesture or in the brooding mystery of the Indian summer when
one seemed to hear the earth turn in the stillness touched
Christopher with a sudden melancholy and it appeared to him when
he went on again that a shadow had fallen over the brightness of
the autumn fields Disturbed by the unrest which follows any
illuminating vision of ideal beauty he asked himself almost
angrily in an effort to divert his thoughts if it were possible
that he was weakening in his purpose since he no longer found
the old zest in his hatred of Fletcher The deadness of his
emotions had then affected this one alsothe single feeling
which he had told himself would be eternal and the old nervous
thrill so like the thrill of violent love no longer troubled
him when he chanced to meet his enemy face to face Today he
held Will Fletcher absolutely in his hand he knew in a few
years at most his debt to Fletcher would probably be cancelled
the man and the boy would then be held together by blood ties
like two snarling hounds in the leashand yet when all was
said what would the final outcome yield of satisfaction As he
put the question he knew that he could meet it only by evasion
and his inherited apathy enfeebled him even while he demanded an
answer of himself

As the months went on his indifference to success or failure
pervaded him like a physical lethargy and he played his game so
recklessly at last that he sometimes caught himself wondering if
it were after all worth a single flicker of the candle He
still saw Will Fletcher daily but when the spring came he ceased
consciously rather from weariness than from any nobler
sentiment to exert an influence which he felt to be harmful to
the boy For four years he had wrought tirelessly to compass the
ruin of Fletchers ambition and now when he had but to stretch
forth his arm for the final blow he admitted impatiently that
what he lacked was the impulsive energy the deed required

He was still in this mood when one afternoon in April as he was
driving his oxen to the store he met Fletcher in the road behind
the pair of bays At sight of him the old mans temper slipped
control and at the end of a few minutes they were quarrelling as
to who should be the one to turn aside

Git out of the road will you cried Fletcher half rising from
his seat and jerking at the reins until the horses reared Drive
your brutes into the bushes and let me pass

If you think Im going to swerve an inch out of my road to
oblige you Bill Fletcher you are almost as big a fool as you
are a rascal replied Christopher in a cool voice as he brought
his team to a halt and placed himself at the head of it with his
long rawhide whip in his hand

As he stood there he had the appearance of taking his time as
lightly as did the Olympian deities and it was clear that he
would wait patiently until the sun set and rose again rather than
yield one jot or tittle of his right upon the muddy road While
he gazed placidly over Fletchers head into the golden distance
he removed his big straw hat and began fanning his heated face

There followed a noisy upbraiding from Fletcher which ended by
his driving madly into the underbrush and almost overturning the
heavy carriage As he passed he leaned from his seat and slashed
his whip furiously into Christophers face then he drove on at a
wild pace bringing the horses in a shiver and flecked with
foam into the gravelled drive before the Hall

The bright flowerbeds and the calm white pillars were all in
sunshine and Miss Saidie with a little green wateringpot in
her hand was sprinkling a tub of crocuses beside the steps

You look flustered Brother Bill she observed as Fletcher
threw the reins to a Negro servant and came up to where she
stood

Oh Ive just had some words with that darned Blake returned
Fletcher chewing the end of his mustache as he did when he was
in a rage I met him as I drove up the road and he had the
impudence to keep his oxcart standing plumb still while I tore
through the briers Its the third time this thing has happened
and Ill be even with him for it yet

Im sure he must be a very rude person remarked Miss Saidie
pinching off a withered blossom and putting it in her pocket to
keep from throwing it on the trim grass For my part Ive never
been able to see what satisfaction people git out of being
illmannered It takes twice as long as it does to be polite and
its not nearly so good for the digestion afterward

Fletcher listened to her with a scowl Well if you ever get
anything but curses from Christopher Blake Id like to hear of
it he said with a coarse laugh

Why he was really quite civil to me the other day when I passed
him replied Miss Saidie facing Fletcher with her hand resting
on the belt of her apron I was in the phaeton and he got down
off his wagon and picked up my whip I declare it almost took my
breath away but when I thanked him he raised his hat and spoke
very pleasantly

Oh you and your everlasting excuses sneered Fletcher going
up the steps and turning on the porch to look down upon her I
tell you Ive had as many of em as Im going to stand This is
my house and what I say in it has got to be the last word If
you squirt any more of that blamed water around here the place
will rot to pieces under our very feet

Miss Saidie placed her wateringpot on the step and lifted to him
the look of amiable wonder which he found more irritating than a
sharp retort

I forgot to tell you that Susan Spade has been waiting to speak
to you she remarked as if their previous conversation had been
of the friendliest nature

Oh drat her What does she want

She wouldnt tell meit was for you alone she said That was a
good halfhour ago and shes been waiting in your settingroom
ever sence Shes such a sharptongued woman I wonder how Tom
manages to put up with her

Well if he does I wont growled Fletcher as he went in to
meet his visitor

Mrs Spade wearing a severe manner and a freshly starched purple
calico was sitting straight and stiff on the edge of the
cretonnecovered lounge and as he entered she rose to receive
him with a visible unbending of her person She was a lank woman
with a long scrawny figure which appeared to have run entirely
to muscle and very full skirts that always sagged below the
beltline in the back Her face was like that of a man
largefeatured impressive and not without a ruddy masculine
comeliness

Its my duty thats brought me Mr Fletcher she began as
they shook hands You kin see very well yoself that its not a
pleasure as far as that goes for if it had been I never should
have comenot if I yearned and pined till I was sore I never saw
a pleasure in my life that didnt lead astray an Ive got the
eye of suspicion on the most harmlesslookin one that goes As I
tell Tomthough he wont believe itthe only way to be sartain
youre followin yo duty in this world is to find out the thing
you hate most to do an then do it with all yo might That rule
has taken me through life suh it married me to Tom Spade an
its brought me here today Dont you go up thar blabbin on
Will Fletcher said Tom when I was tyin on my bonnet You
neednt say one word mo about it was my reply I know the
Lords way an I know mine Ive wrastled with this in prar
an I tell you when the Lord turns anybodys stomach so dead agin
a piece of business it means most likely that its the very
thing theyve got to swallow down

Oh Will gasped Fletcher dropping suddenly into his armchair
Please come to the point at once maam and let me hear what
the rascal has done last

Im comin suh Im comin Mrs Spade hastened to assure him
Yes Tom an I hev talked it all down to the very bone but I
wouldnt trust a mans judgment on morals any mo than I would on
matchin calico Right an wrong dont look the same to em by
lamplight as they do by day an if thar conscience aint set
plum in the pupils of thar eyes I dont know whar tis thats
sho But thank heaven I aint one of those thats always
findin an excuse for peoplenot even if the backslider be my
own husband Thars got to be some few folks on the side of
decency an Im one of em Virtues a slippery thingthats
how I look at itan if you dont git a good grip on it an
watch it with a mighty stern eye its precious apt to wriggle
through yo fingers Im an honest woman Mr Fletcher an I
wouldnt blush to own it in the presence of the King of England

Great Scott exclaimed Fletcher with a brutal laugh do you
mean to tell me the precious young fool has fallen in love with
you

Me suh If he had a broomstick an a spar rib or so would
have been all youd ever found of him agin Ive never yit laid
eyes on the man I couldnt settle with a single sweep an when a
lone woman comes to wantin a protector Ive never seen the
husband that could hold a candle to a good stout broom Thats
what I said to Jinnie when she got herself engaged to Fred
Boxley Married or single I said gal wife or widow a
broom is yo best friend

Fletcher twisted impatiently in his chair

Oh for heavens sake stop your drivelling he blurted out at
last and tell me in plain language what the boy has done

Oh I dont know what hes done or what he hasnt rejoined
Mrs Spade but Ive watched him courtin Molly Peterkin till I
told Tom this thing had to stop or I would stop it If thars a
pisonous snake or lizard in this country suh its that
towheaded huzzy of Sol Peterkins an if thars a sex on this
earth that I aint go no patience with its the woman sex A man
may slip an slide a little because he was made that way but
when it comes to a woman shes got to war whalebones in her
clothes when Im aroun Lord Lord Whats the use of bein
honest if you cant pint yo finger at them that aint Virtue
gits mighty little in the way of gewgaws in this world an I
reckon its got to make things up in the way it feels when it
looks at them thats gone astray

Molly Peterkin gasped Fletcher striking the arm of his chair
a blow that almost shattered it Christopher Blake was bad
enough and now its Molly Peterkin Out of the fryingpan right
spang into the fire Oh you did me a good turn in coming Mrs
Spade Ill forgive you the news you brought and Ill even
forgive you your blasted chatter How long has this thing been
going on do you know

That I dont suh that I dont though Ive been pryin an
peekin mighty close All I know is that every blessed evenin
for the last two weeks Ive seen em walkin together in the lane
that leads to Sols This here aint goin to keep up one day
mo thats what I put my foot down on yestiddy Id stop it if I
didnt have nothin agin that gal but the colour of her hair I
don know how tis suh but Ive always had the feelin that
thars somethin indecent about yaller hair an if Id been born
with it Id have stuck my head into a bowl of pitch befo Id
have gone flauntin those corntassels in the eyes of every man I
met Thars nothin in the looks of me thats goin to make a man
regret hes got a wife if I can help it an mark my word Mr
Fletcher if they had dyed Molly Peterkins hair black she might
have been a selfrespectin woman an a hater of men this very
day A light character an a light head go precious well
together an when you set one a good sober colour the others
pretty apt to follow

Fletcher rose from his chair and stood gripping the table hard

Have you any reason to thinkdoes it look likelythat young
Blake has had a hand in this he asked

Who Mr Christopher Why I dont believe he could tell a
petticoat from a pair of breeches to save his soul He aint got
no fancy for corntassels and blue ribbons I kin tell you that
Its good honest women that are the mothers of families that he
takes to an even then it aint no mo than How are you Mrs
Spade A fine mornin

Well thars one thing you may be sartain of returned
Fletcher breaking in upon her and that is that this whole
business is as good as settled I leave here with the boy
tomorrow morning at sunrise and he doesnt set foot agin in
this county until hes gone straight through the university Ill
drag him clean across the broad ocean before he shall do it

Then as Mrs Spade took a noisy departure he stood without
listening to her gazing morosely down upon the pattern of the
carpet



CHAPTER V The Happiness of Tucker

Early in the following November Jim Weatherby returning from
the crossroads one rainy afternoon brought Christopher a long
wailing letter from Will

Oh Ive had to walk a chalkline sure enough he wrote
since that awful day we left home in a pouring rain with
grandpa wearing a whole thunderstorm on his forehead It has been
cram cram cram ever since I can tell you and here I am now
just started at the university with my head still buzzing with
the noise of those confounded ancients If grandpa hadnt gone
when he did I declare I believe he would have ended by driving
me clean crazy Since he left Ive had time to take a look about
me and I find theres a good deal of fun to be got here after
all How Ill manage to mix it in with Greek I dont see but
lucks with me you knowIve found that outso I shant
bother

By the way I wish you would make Molly Peterkin understand how
it was I came away so hastily Tell her I havent forgotten her
and give her the little turquoise pin Im sending It just
matches her eyes Be sure to let me know if shes as pretty as
ever

By the next mail the turquoise brooch arrived and Christopher
putting it in his pocket went over to Sol Peterkins to bear the
message to the girl As it happened she was swinging on the
little sagging gate when he came up the lane and at sight of him
her eyebrows shot up under her flaxen curls which hung low upon
her forehead She was a pretty soulless little animal coloured
like peachblossoms and with a great deal of that soft
insipidity which is usually found in a boys ideal of maiden
innocence

Why I couldnt believe my eyes when I first saw you she said
arranging her curls over her left shoulder with a conscious
simper

The old Blake gallantry rose to meet her challenging eyes and he
regarded her smilingly a moment before he answered

Well I could hardly believe mine you know he responded
carelessly I thought for an instant that a big butterfly had
alighted on the gate

She pouted prettily

Wont you come in she asked after a moment with an
embarrassed air as she remembered that he was one of the real
Blakes for whom her father used to work

A light retort was on his lips but while he looked at her a
little weary frown darkened her shallow eyes and with the
peculiar sympathy for all those oppressed by man or nature which
was but one expression of his manysided temperament he quickly
changed the tone of his reply At the instant it seemed to him
that Molly Peterkin and himself stood together defrauded of their
rightful heritage of life and as his thought broadened he felt
suddenly the pathos of her forlorn little figure of her foolish
blue eyes of her trivial vanities of her girlish beauty soiled
and worn by common handling A look very like compassion was in
his face and the girl seeing it reddened angrily and kicked at
a loose pebble in the path When he went away a moment later he
left a careless message for Sol about the tobacco crop and the
little white box containing the turquoise brooch was still in his
pocket

That afternoon the trinket went back to Will with a curt letter
If you take my advice youll leave Molly Peterkin alone he
wrote in his big unformed hand for as far as I can see you are
too good a match to get on well together Shes a fool you know
and from the way youre going on just now it looks very much as
if you were one also At any rate Im not your man for
gallantries Id rather hunt hares than women any dayand
games plentiful just now

It was a long winter that year and for the first time since her
terrible illness Mrs Blake was forced to keep her bed during a
bitter spell of weather when the raw winds whistled around the
little frame house entering the cracks at the doors and the
loosened sashes of the windows Cynthia grew drawn and pinched
with a sickly frostbitten look and even Lilas rare bloom
drooped for a while like that of a delicate plant starving for
the sunshine Christopher who as usual was belated in his
winters work was kept busy hauling and chopping wood
shovelling the snow away from the porch and the paths that led to
the well the stable and the barn Once a day most often after
breakfast Jim Weatherby appeared smiling gaily beneath his
powdering of snow and sometimes in defiance of Cynthia he
would take Lila for a sleighride from which she would return
blossoming like a rose

Mrs Blake from her tester bed complained bitterly of the cold
and drew from the increasing severity of the winters which she
declared became more unbearable each year warrant for her belief
in the gradual decline of the world as a dwellingplace

You may say what you please Tucker she remarked one morning
when she had awakened with an appetite to find that her eggs had
frozen in the kitchen but you can hardly be so barefaced as to
compliment this weather Im sure I never felt anything like it
when I was young

Well at least I have a roof over my head now and I didnt when
I marched to Romney with old Stonewall remarked Tucker from the
hearth where he was roasting an apple before the big logs
Manys the morning I waked then with the snow frozen stiff all
over me and I had to crack through it before I could get up

The old lady made a peevish gesture

It may sound ungrateful she returned but Im sometimes
tempted to wish that you had never marched to Romney or that
General Jackson had been considerate enough to choose a milder
spell I really believe when you come to die you will console
yourself with the recollection of something worse that happened
in the war

Tucker laughed softly to himself as he watched the apple
revolving in the red heat on its bit of string Well Im not
sure that I shant Lucy he said

Habits mighty strong you know and when you come to think of
it theres some comfort in knowing that youll never have to face
the worst again A man doesnt duck his head at the future when
hes learned that let be what will it cant be so bad as the
thing hes gone through with and yet come out on top It gives
him a pretty good feeling after all to know that he hasnt
funked the hardest knock that life could give Well my birds are
hungry I reckon and Ill hobble out and feed em while this
apple is roasting to the core

Raising himself with difficulty he got upon his crutches and
went to scatter his crumbs from the kitchen window

By the first of March the thaw came and the snow melted in a day
beneath the lavish spring sunshine It was a week later that
Christopher coming from the woods at midday saw Tucker sitting
on his old bench by the damask rosebush in which the sap was
just beginning to swell The sun shone full on the dead grass
and the old soldier with his chin resting in the crook of his
crutch was gazing straight down upon the earth The expression
of his large kindly face was so radiant with enjoyment that
Christopher quickened his steps and slapped him affectionately
upon the shoulder

Is Fletcher dead Uncle Tucker he inquired laughing

No no nobodys dead that Ive heard of responded Tucker in
his cheerful voice but something better than Bill Fletchers
death has happened I can tell you Why Id been sitting out
here an hour or more longing for the spring to come when
suddenly I looked down and there was the first dandeliona
regular miracleblooming in the mould about that old rosebush

Well Ill be hanged exclaimed Christopher aghast Mark my
words youll be in an asylum yet

The other chuckled softly

When you put me there youll shut up the only wise man in the
county he returned If your sanity doesnt make you happy I
can tell you its worth a great deal less than my craziness Look
at that dandelion nowit has filled two hours chock full of
thought and colour for me when I might have been puling indoors
and nagging at God Almighty about trifles The time has been when
Id have walked right over that little flower and not seen it
and now it grows yellower each minute that I look at it and each
minute I see it better than I did the one before Theres nothing
in life when you come to think of itnot Columbus setting out
to sea nor Napoleon starting on a marchmore wonderful than that
brave little blossom putting up the first of all through the
earth

I cant see anything in a dandelion but a nuisance observed
Christopher sitting down on the bench and baring his head to the
sunshine but you do manage to get interest out of life thats
certain

Interest Good Lord exclaimed Tucker If a man cant find
something to interest him in a world like this he must be a dull
fellow or else have a serious trouble of the liver So long as I
have my eyes and theres a different sky over my head each day
and earth and trees and flowers all around me I dont reckon
Ill begin to whistle to boredom If I were like Lucy now I
sometimes think things would be up with me and yet Lucy is one
of the very happiest women Ive ever known Her brain is so
filled with pleasant memories that its never empty for an
instant

Christophers face softened as it always did at an allusion to
his mothers blindness

Youre right he said she is happy

To be sure shes had her life pursued Tucker without
noticing him Shes been a beauty a belle a sweetheart a
wife and a motherto say nothing of a very spoiled old woman
but all the same I dont think I have her magnificent patience
Oh I couldnt sit in the midst of all this and not have eyes to
see

With a careless smile Christopher glanced about himat the
bright blue sky seen through the bare trees at the dried carrot
flowers in the old field across the road at the great pine
growing on the little knoll

I hardly think she misses much he said and added after a
moment Do you know Id give twentyno forty fifty years of
this for a single year of the big noisy world over there Im
dogtired of stagnation

Well its natural admitted Tucker gently At your age I
doubtless felt the same The young want action and they ought to
have it because it makes the quiet of middle age seem all the
sweeter Youve missed your duels and your flirtations and your
pomades and youve been put into breeches and into philosophy at
the same time Why one might as well stick a brier pipe in the
mouth of a boy who is crying for his first gun and tell him to go
sit in the chimneycorner and be happy When I was twentyfive I
travelled all the way to New York for the latest Parisian
waistcoat but I cant remember that I ever strolled round the
corner to see a peachtree in full bloom Im a lot happier now
heaven knows in my homespun coat than I was then in that
waistcoat of satin brocade so I sometimes catch myself wishing
that I could see again the people I knew thenthe men I
quarrelled with and the women I kissed Id like to apologise for
the young fool of thirty years ago

Christopher stirred restlessly and clasping his hands behind
his head stared at a small white cloud drifting slowly above the
great pine

Well its the fool part I envy you all the same he remarked

Youre welcome to it my boy answered Tucker then he paused
abruptly and bent his ear Ah theres the bluebird Do you hear
him whistling in the meadow God bless him hes a hearty fellow
and has spring in his throat

I passed one coming up said Christopher

The same I reckon Hell be paying me a visit soon and Ive
got my crumbs ready He smiled brightly and then sat with his
chin on his crutch looking steadily across the road You
havent had your chance my boy he resumed presently and a
man ought to have several chances to look round him in this
world for otherwise the things he misses will always seem to him
the only things worth having Im not much of a fellow to preach
youll saya hundred and eighty pounds of flesh that cant dress
itself nor hobble about without crutches that are strapped on
but if its the last word I speak I wouldnt change a day in my
long life and if it came to going over it again Id trust it all
in the Lords hands and start blindfolded And yet when I look
back upon it now I see that it wasnt much of a life as lives
go and the two things I wanted most in it I never got

Christopher turned quickly with a question

Oh you think I have always been a contented prosaic chap
pursued Tucker smiling but you were never more mistaken since
you were born Twice in my life I came mighty near blowing out my
brainsonce when I found that I couldnt go to Paris and be an
artist and the second time when I couldnt get the woman I
wanted for my wife I wasnt cut out for a farmer you see and I
had always meant from the time I was a little boy to go abroad
and study painting Id set my heart on it as people say but
when the time came my father died and I had to stay at home to
square his debts and run the place For a single night I was as
clean crazy as a man ever was It meant the sacrifice of my
career you know and a career seemed a much bigger thing to me
then than it does today

I never heard that said Christopher lowering his voice

Theres a lot we dont know even about the people we live in a
little house with You never heard either I dare say that I
was so madly in love once that when the woman threw me over for a
better man I shut myself up in a cabin in the woods and did not
speak to a human being for six months I was a rare devil sure
enough though youd never believe it to see me now It took two
blows like that a four years war and the surgeons operating
table to teach me how to be happy

It was Miss Matoaca Bolling I suppose suggested Christopher
with a mild curiosity

The old soldier broke into his soft full laugh

Matoaca Bless your soul no But to think that Lucy should have
kept a secret for more than thirty years Never talk to me again
about a womans letting anything out If shes got a secret that
it mortifies her to tell it will be buried in the grave with her
and most likely it will never see the light at judgment Day Lucy
was always ashamed of my being jilted you know

Its a new story then is it

Oh its as old as the hills by now Whats the funny part
though is that Lucy has always tried to persuade herself it was
really Matoaca I cared for You know I sometimes think that a
woman can convince herself that black is white if she only keeps
trying hard enoughand its marvellous that she never sees the
difference between wanting to believe a thing and believing it in
earnest Now if Matoaca had been the last woman on this earth
and I the last man I could never have fallen in love with her
though I may as well confess that I had my share of fancies when
I was young Its no use attempting to explain a mans feelings
of course Matoaca was almost as great a belle as Lucy and she
was the handsomest creature you ever laid eyes onone of those
big managing women who are forever improving things around them
Why I dont believe she could stay two seconds in a mans arms
without improving the set of his cravat Some men like that kind
of thing but I never did and I often think the reason I went so
mad about the other woman was that she came restful after
Matoaca She was the comforting kind who you might be sure
always saw you at your best and no matter the mood you were in
she never wanted to pat and pull you into shape Lucy always said
she couldnt hold a candle to Matoaca in looks and I suppose she
was right but pretty or plain that girl had something about
her that went straight to my heart more than thirty years ago and
stays there still Strange to say Ive tried to believe that it
was half compassion for she always reminded me of a little wild
bird that somebody had caught and shut up in a cage and it used
to seem to me sometimes that I could almost hear the fluttering
of her soul Well whatever it was the feeling was the sort that
is most worth while though she didnt think so of course and
broke her great heart over another man She married him and had
six children and died a few years ago He was a fortunate fellow
I suppose and yet I cant help fancying that Ive had the better
part and the Lord was right She was not happy they said and he
knew it and yet had to face those eyes of hers every day It was
like many other marriages I reckon he got used to her body and
never caught so much as a single glimpse of her soul Then she
faded away and died to him but to me shes just the same as when
I first saw her and I still believe that if she could come here
and sit on this old bench I should be perfectly happy Its a
lucky man I tell you who can keep the same desire for more than
thirty years

He shook his head slowly smiling as he listened to the bluebird
singing in the road And now Ill be fetching my crumbs he
added struggling to his crutches

When he had helped Tucker to the house Christopher came back and
sat down again on the bench closing his eyes to the sunshine
the spring sky and the dandelion blooming in the mould He was
very tired and his muscles ached from the strain of heavy
labour yet as he lingered there in the warm wind it seemed to
him that action was the one thing he desired The restless season
worked in his blood and he felt the stir of old impulses that
had revived each year with the quickening sap since the first
pilgrimage man made on earth He wanted to be up and away while
he was still young and his heart beat high and at the moment he
would have found positive delight in any convulsion of the
natural order in any excuse for a headlong and impetuous plunge
into life

He heard the door open again and Tucker shuffled out into the
path and began scattering his crumbs upon the gravel When
Christopher passed a moment later on his way to the house the
old soldier was merrily whistling an invitation to a glimpse of
blue in a treetop by the road

The spring dragged slowly and with June came the transplanting
of the young tobacco This was the busiest season of the year
with Christopher and so engrossed was he in his work that for a
week at the end of the month he did not go down for the county
news at Tom Spades store Fletcher was at home he knew but he
had heard nothing of Will and it was through the storekeeper at
last that he learned definitely of the boys withdrawal from the
university Returning from the field one afternoon at sunset he
saw Tom sitting beside Tucker in the yard and in response to a
gesture he crossed the grass and stopped beside the long pine
bench

I say Mr Christopher Ive brought you a bit of news called
the storekeeper at the young mans approach

Well lets have it returned Christopher laughing If youre
going to tell me that Uncle Tucker has discovered a rare weed
though I warn you that I cant support it

Oh Im not in this thank heaven protested Tucker but to
tell the truth Im downright sorry for the boyFletcher or no
Fletcher

Ah said Christopher under his breath so its Will Fletcher

Hes in a jolly scrape this time an no mistake replied Tom
Hes been leadin a wild life at the university it seems an
today Fletcher got a telegram saying that the boy had been
caught cheatin in his examinations The old man left on the next
train as mad as a hornet I can tell you He swore hed bring
the young scamp back an put him to the plough Well well thar
are worse dangers than a pretty gal though Susan wont believe
it

Then hell bring him home asked Christopher blinking in the
sunlight At the instant it seemed to him that sky and field
whirled rapidly before his eyes and a strange noise started in
his ears which he found presently to be the throbbing of his
arteries

Oh hes been given a hard push down the wrong road answered
Tom an its more than likely hell never pull up till he gits
clean to the bottom



CHAPTER VI The Wages of Folly

Two days later Fletchers big new carriage crawled over the muddy
road and Christopher looking up from his work in the field
caught a glimpse of the sullen face Will turned on the familiar
landscape The younger Fletcher had come home evidently nursing a
grievance at his heart his eyes held a look of dogged
resentment and the hand in which he grasped the end of the linen
dustrobe was closed in an almost convulsive grip When he met
Christophers gaze he glanced angrily away without speaking and
then finding himself face to face with his grandfathers scowl he
jerked impatiently in the opposite direction It was clear that
the tussle of wills had as yet wrung only an enforced submission
from the younger man

Lifting his head Christopher stood idly watching the carriage
until it disappeared between the rows of flowering chestnuts
then returning in a halfhearted fashion to his work he found
himself wondering curiously if Fletchers wrath and Wills
indiscretions were really so great as public rumour might lead
one to suppose

An answer to his question came the next evening when he heard a
light familiar whistle outside the stable where he was at work
and a moment afterward Will appeared in the shadow of the
doorway

So it wasnt a cut after all said Christopher with a laugh
as he held out his hand

Ill be hanged if I know what it was was Wills response
turning away after a limp grasp and seating himself upon the big
box in the corner To tell the truth grandpa has put me into
such a fluster that I hardly know my head from my heels Theres
one thing certain though if he doesnt take his eye off me for
a breathing space hell send me to the dogs before he knows it

His face had lost its boyish freshness of complexion and his weak
mouth had settled into lines of sullen discontent Even his dress
displayed the carelessness which is one of the outward marks of a
disordered mind and his bright blue tie was loosely knotted in
unequal lengths

Whats the trouble now demanded Christopher coming from the
stall and hanging his lantern from a nail beside the ladder
where the light fell full on Wills face Out with it and have
done I thought yesterday that you had been driving a hard
bargain with the old man on my account

Oh its not you this time thank heaven returned Will Its
all about that confounded scrape I got into at the university I
told him it would mean trouble if he sent me there but he would
do it whether or no He dragged me away from here you remember
and had me digging at my books with a scatterbrained tutor for a
good six months then when I knew just about enough to start at
the university he hauled me there with his own hands and kept
watch over me for several weeks Im quick at most things like
that so after he went away I thought Id have a little fun and
trust luck to make it up to me at the endbut it all went
against me somehow and then they stirred up that blamed rumpus
about the examinations

Yawning more in disgust than in drowsiness he struck a match on
the edge of the box and lighted a cigarette His flippant manner
was touched with the conscious resentment which still lingered in
his eyes and from the beginning to the end of his account he
betrayed no hint of a regret for his own shabby part in the
affair When it was not possible to rest the blame upon his
grandfather he merely shrugged his shoulders and lightly tossed
the responsibility to fate

This is one of the things I darent do at the house he
remarked after a moment inhaling a cloud of smoke and blowing it
in spirals through his nostrils the old man wont tolerate
anything more decent than a pipe unless it happens to be a chew
Oh Im sick to death of the whole business he burst out
suddenly When I woke up this morning I had more than half a
mind to break loose and go abroad to Maria By the way Wyndhams
dead you know he died last fall just after we went away

Ah is that so exclaimed Christopher Shell come home then
will she

Thats the queer partshe wont and nobody knows why Wyndham
turned out to be a regular scamp of course he treated her
abominably and all that but he no sooner died than she turned
about and picked up one of his sisters to nurse and coddle Oh
its all foolishness but Ive half a mind to run away all the
same A life like this will drive me crazy in six months and
Ill be hanged if it is my fault after all He knew I never had
a head for books but he drove me at them as if I were no better
than a black slave Things have all been against me from the
start and yet I used to think that I was born to be lucky

What does he mean to do with you now inquired Christopher

Put me to the plough he says but I cant stand itI havent
the strength Why this morning he made me hang around that
tobacco field in the blazing sun for two mortal hours minding
those shiftless darkies If I complain or even go off to sit
down in a bit of shade he rushes up and blusters about kicking
me out of doors unless I earn my bread Oh his temper is simply
awful and he gets worse every day Hes growing stingy too
and makes us live like beggars All the vegetables go to market
now and most of the butter and this morning he blew Aunt
Saidies head off because she had spring chickens on the
breakfast table I dont dare ask him for a penny and yet hes
richone of the richest men in the State they say

Well it sounds jolly observed Christopher smiling

Oh you cant imagine the state of things and youd never
believe it if I told you Its worse than any fuss you ever heard
of or ever saw I used to be able to twist him round my finger
you know and now he hates me worse than he does a snake He
hasnt spoken a word to me since that scene we had at the
university except to order me to go out and watch the Negroes
plant tobacco If he finds out I want a thing hell move heaven
and earth to keep me from getting itand then sit by and grin
Hes got a devil in him thats the truth and theres nothing to
do except keep out of his way as much as possible Im patient
tooAunt Saidie knows itand the only time I ever hit back was
when he jumped on you the other day Then I got mad and struck
out hard I tell you

Christopher leaned over and began buckling and unbuckling a
leather strap in the harnessbox

Dont get into hot water on my account he returned the more
he abuses me you know the better I like it But its odd that
after all these years he should want to turn you into an
overseer

Well he shant do it thats certain It will be a cold day
when he gets me masquerading in the family character Let him go
just one step too far and Ill shake him off for good and strike
out on a freighttrain Life couldnt be any worse than it is
now and it might be a great deal better As to my hanging round
like this much longer and swearing at a pack of worthless
darkieswell its more than I bargain for thats all

Theres not much excitement in it to be sure I would rather be
a freighthand myself I think when all is said

Oh you neednt joke You were brought up to it and it doesnt
come so hard

Doesnt it

Not so hard as it does to me at any rate Theres got to be
some dash about life I tell you to make it suit my taste I
wasnt born to settle down and count my money and my tobacco from
morning till night Its spice I want in things andhang it I
dont believe theres a pretty woman in the county

For a moment Christopher stared silently down at the matted
straw His face had grown dark and the reckless lines about his
mouth became suddenly prominent

Why wheres Molly Peterkin he asked abruptly with a laugh
that seemed to slip from him against his will

The other broke into a long whistle and tossed the end of his
cigarette through the doorway

You neednt think Ive forgotten her he replied shes the
one bright spot I see in this barren hole By the way why do you
think her a fool

Because she is one

And youre a brute What does a man want with brains in a woman
anyway Maria had them and they didnt keep her from coming to
shipwreck

Christopher reached for the lantern

Well Ive got to go now he broke in and youd better be
trotting home or youll have the old man and the hounds out after
you

With the lantern swinging from his hand he went to the door and
waited for Will then passing out he turned the key in the lock
and with a short Goodnight started briskly toward the house

Will followed him to the kitchen steps and then keeping to the
path that trailed across the yard he passed through the
whitewashed gate and went on along the sunken road which led by
the abandoned icepond Here he turned into the avenue of
chestnuts and with the lighted windows of the Hall before him
walked slowly toward the impending interview with his
grandfather

As he entered the house Miss Saidie looked out from the
diningroom doorway and beckoned in a stealthy fashion with the
henhouse key

He has been hunting everywhere for you she whispered and I
told him youd gone for a little stroll along the road

An expression of anger swept over Wills face and he made a
helpless gesture of revolt

I wont stand it any longer he answered with a spurt of
resolution which was exhausted in the feeble speech

Miss Saidie put up her hand and straightened his necktie with an
affectionate pat

Only for a little while dear she urged hes in one of his
black humours and it will blow over never fear Things are
never so bad but theres hope of a mending some day Try to
please him and go to work as he wants you to do It all came of
the trouble at the universityhe had set his heart on your
carrying off the honours

It was his fault said Will stubbornly I begged him not to
send me there It was his fault

Well that cant be helped now returned the little woman
decisively All we can do is to make things as easy as we can
and if thars ever to be any peace in this house again you must
try to humour him I never saw him in such a state before and
Ive known him for sixty years and slept in a trundlebed with
him as a baby The queerest thing about it too is that he seems
to get closer and closer every day Just now thar was a big fuss
because I hadnt sent all the fresh butter to market and I
thought hed have a fit when he found I was saving some asparagus
for dinner tomorrow

Where is he now asked Will in a whisper

Complaining over some bills in his settingroom and he actually
told me a while ago when I went in that he had been a fool to
give Maria so much money for Wyndham to throw away Poor Maria
Im sure she has had a hard enough time without being abused for
something she couldnt help But it really is a passion with him
thars no use denying it He spends his whole time adding up the
cost of what we eat

Then as the supperbell rang in the hall she finished
hurriedly and assuming a cheerful manner took her place behind
the silver service

Fletcher entered with a heavy step his eyes lowering beneath his
bushy eyebrows The weight of his years appeared to have fallen
upon him in a night and he was no longer the hale ruddy man of
middle age with his breezy speeches and his occasional touches
of coarse humour The untidiness of his clothes was still
markedhis coat his cravat his finger nails all showed the old
lack of neatness

Wont you say grace Brother Bill asked Miss Saidie as he
paused abstractedly beside his chair

Bending his head he mumbled a few hurried words and then cast a
suspicious glance over the long table

I told you to use the butter with onions in it he said
helping himself and tasting a little on the end of his knife
This brings forty cents a pound in market and Ill not have the
waste

Oh Brother Bill the other is so bad gasped Miss Saidie
nervously

Its good enough for you and me I reckon We want brought up
on any better and whats good enough for us is good enough for
my grandson Then he turned squarely upon Will So youre back
eh Whar did you go he demanded

Will tried to meet his eyes failed and stared gloomily at the
whiteandred border of the tablecloth

I went out for a breath of air he answered in a muffled voice
Its been stifling all day

Youve got to get used to it I reckon returned the old man
with a brutal laugh Ill have no idlers and no fancy men about
me

An ugly smile distorted his coarse features and laying down his
knife and fork he sat watching his grandson with his small
bloodshot eyes



CHAPTER VII The Toss of a Coin

A fortnight passed before Will came to Christophers again and
then he stole over one evening in the shadow of the twilight
Things were no better he said they were even worse than usual
the work in the tobacco field was simply what he couldnt stand
and his grandfather was growing more intolerable every day
Besides this the very dullness of the life was fast driving him
to distraction He had smuggled a bottle of whisky from the town
and last night after a hot quarrel with the old man he had
succeeded in drugging himself to sleep My nerves have gone all
to pieces he finished irritably and its nothing on earth but
this everlasting bickering that has done it Its more than flesh
and blood can be expected to put up with

His hand shook a little when he lighted a cigarette and his
face which was burned red from wind and sun contracted
nervously as he talked It was the wildness in his speech
however the suppressed excitement which ran in an undercurrent
beneath his words that caused the other to turn sharply and
regard him for a moment with gathered brows

Well take my advice and dont try that dodge too often
remarked Christopher in a careless tone

What in the deuce does it matter returned Will desperately
It was the only quiet night Ive had for three weeks I slept
like a log straight through until the breakfastbell Then I was
late of course and he threatened to take an hours time from my
days wages By the way he pays me now you know just as he
does the other labourers

For a time he kept up his rambling complaint but breaking off
abruptly at last made some trivial excuse and started homeward
across the fields Christopher looking after him was hardly
surprised when he saw him branch off into the shaded lane that
led to Sol Peterkins

There followed a month when the two met only at long intervals
and then with a curious constraint of manner Sometimes
Christopher stopping on his way to the pasture would exchange a
few words over the rail fence with Will who lounged on the edge
of his grandfathers tobacco crop but the old intimacy had
ceased suddenly to exist and it was evident that a newer
interest had distracted the boys ardent fancy

It was not until August that the meaning of the change was made
clear to Christopher when coming one day to a short turn in a
little woodland road upon his land he saw Will and Molly
Peterkin sitting side by side on a fallen log The girl had been
crying and at the sight of Christopher she gave a frightened sob
and pulled her blue gingham sunbonnet down over her forehead but
Will inspired at the instant by some ideal of chivalry drew her
hand through his arm and came out boldly into the road

You know Molly he said in a brave voice that was not without
pathos but you dont know that she has promised to be my wife

Whatever the purpose of the girls tears she had need of them no
longer for with an embarrassed little laugh she flushed and
dimpled into her pretty smile

Your wife repeated Christopher blankly Why youre no better
than two children and deserve to be whipped If I were in your
place Id start to catching butterflies and quit fooling

He passed on laughing merrily but before the day was over he
began to wonder seriously if Will could be really sincere in his
intention to marry Molly Peterkinpoor pretty Molly whose fame
was blown to the four corners of the county

By night the question had come to perplex him in earnest and it
was almost with relief that he heard a familiar rattle on his
windowpane as he undressed and looking out saw Will standing
in the long grass by the porch

Well its time you turned up he said when he had slipped
cautiously down the staircase and joined him in the yard

Get your lantern returned Will and come on to the barn
Theres something I must see you about at once and while the
other went in search of the light he stood impatiently uprooting
a tuft of grass as he whistled a college song in unsteady tones

At the end of a minute Christopher reappeared bearing the
lantern which he declared was quite unnecessary because of the
rising moon

Oh but I must talk indoors responded Will the night makes
me creepyit always did

So there is something to say and its no nonsense Are the
skies about to fall or has your grandfather got a grip on his
temper

Pshaw Its not that Wait till we get inside And when they
had entered the barn he turned and carefully closed the door
after flashing the light over the trampled straw in the dusky
corners In the shed outside a newborn calf bleated plaintively
and at the sound he started and broke into an apologetic laugh
You thought I was joking today he said suddenly

Christopher nodded

So I presumed he answered wondering if drink or love or both
together had produced so extreme an agitation

Well I wasnt declared Will and placing the lantern on the
floor he raised his head to meet the others look I was as
dead in earnest as I am this minuteand if its the last word I
ever speak I mean to marry Molly Peterkin

His excitable nerves were plainly on the rack of some strong
emotion and as he met the blank amazement in Christophers face
he turned away with a gesture of angry reproach

Then youre a fool said Christopher with a shrug of his
shoulders

Will quivered as if the words struck him like a whip

Because shes Sol Peterkins daughter he burst out
Christopher smiled

Its not her father but her character that I was thinking of
he answered and the next instant fell back in sheer surprise
for Will flinging himself recklessly upon him struck him
squarely in the mouth

As they fell breathlessly apart Christopher was conscious that
for the first time in his life he felt something like respect for
Will Fletcheror at least for that expression of courageous
passion which in the vivid moments of mens lives appears to
raise the strong and the weak alike above the ordinary level of
their surroundings For a second he stood swallowing down the
anger which the blow aroused in himan anger as purely physical
as the mounting of the hot blood to his cheekthen he looked
straight into the others face and spoke in a pleasant voice

I beg your pardon it was all my fault he said

I knew youd see it answered Will appeased at once by the
confession and I counted on you to help us thats why I came

To help you repeated Christopher a little startled

Well weve got to be married you knowtheres simply nothing
else to do All this confounded talk about Molly has come near
killing her and the poor child is afraid to look anybody in the
face Shes so innocent you know that half the time she doesnt
understand what their lies are all about

Good God said Christopher beneath his breath

And besides what use is there in waiting urged Will Grandpa
wont be any better fifty years from now than he is today and
by that time wed be old and grayhaired This life is more than
I can stand anyway and it makes mighty little difference
whether it ends one way or another Just so I have Molly I dont
care much what happens 

But you cant marryits simply out of the question Why
youre not yet twenty

Oh we cant marry here of course but were going on to
Washington tomorrowall our plans are made and thats why I
came to see you I want to borrow your horses to take us to the
crossroads at midnight 

Seizing him by the shoulder Christopher shook him roughly in a
powerful grasp

Wake up he said impatiently you are either drunk or asleep
and youre going headlong to the devil If you do this thing
youll be ashamed of it in two weeks Then he released him
laughing as he watched him totter and regain his balance But if
youre bent on being an ass then for heavens sake go and be
one he added irritably

A shiver passed through Will and he stuttered an instant before
he could form his words

She told me youd say that he replied She told me youd
always hated her

Hate her Nonsense She isnt worth it Id as soon hate a white
kitten As far as that goes Ive nothing against the girl and I
dont doubt shed be a much better wife than most men deserve
Im not prating about virtue mind you Im only urging common
sense Youre too young and too big a fool to marry anybody

Well you disapprove of her at any rateyoure against her
and thats why I havent talked about her before Shes the most
beautiful creature alive I tell you and I wouldnt give her up
if to keep her meant Id be a beggar

It will mean that most likely

Turning away Will drew a small flask from his pocket and
unscrewing the stopper raised the bottle to his lips Id go
mad but for this he said thats why Ive carried it about
with me for the last week Its the only thing that drives away
this horrible depression

As he drank Christopher regarded him curiously noting that the
whisky lent animation to his face and an unnatural luster to his
eyes The sunburn on his forehead appeared to deepen all at once
and there was a bright red flush across his cheeks

You wont take my advice said Christopher at last but I
cant help telling you that unless youre raving mad youd better
drop the whole affair as soon as possible

Not nownot now  protested Will gaily consumed by an
artificial energy Dont preach to me while the taste of a drink
is still in my mouth for theres no heart so strong as the one
whisky puts into a man When I feel my courage oozing from my
fingers I can reinforce it in less time than it takes to sneak
away

Growing boisterous he assumed a ridiculous swagger and broke
into a fragment of a college song Until morning he would not
probably become himself again and knowing this Christopher
desisted helplessly from his efforts at persuasion

You will lend me the horses asked Will keeping closely to his
point

Are you steady enough

Of courseof course  he stretched out his hands and moved a
pace or two away and besides Dolly drives like old Nick

Well Ill see said Christopher and going to the window he
flung back the rude shutter and looked out into the August night
The warm air touched his face like a fragrant breath and from
the darkness a big white moth flew over his shoulder to where the
lantern burned dimly on the floor

I may take them urged Will again pulling him by the sleeve

At the words Christopher turned and walked slowly back across the
barn

Yes Ill lend them to you he answered without meeting the
others eyes

Youre a jolly good chap I always knew it  cried Will
heartily Ill take them out at midnight when theres a good
moon and get Jerry Green to drive them back tomorrow Hurrah
Its the best nights work you ever did

He went out hurriedly still singing his college song and
Christopher without moving from his place stood watching the
big white moth that circled dizzily about the lantern At the
instant he regretted that Will had appealed to himregretted
even that he had promised him the horses He wished it had all
come about without his knowledgethat Fletchers punishment and
Wills ruin had been wrought less directly by his own
intervention Next he told himself that he would have stopped
this thing had it been possible and then with the thought he
became clearly aware that it was still in his power to prevent
the marriage He had but to walk across the fields to Fletchers
door and before sunrise the foolish pair would be safely home
again Will would probably be sent off to recover and Molly
would go back to making butter and to flirting with Fred Turner
On the other hand let the marriage but take placelet him keep
silent until the morningand the revenge of which he had dreamed
since childhood would be accomplished at a single stroke Bill
Fletchers many sins would find him out in a night

The big moth fluttering aimlessly from the lantern flew
suddenly in his face and the touch startled him from his
abstraction With a laugh he shook the responsibility from his
shoulders and then as he hesitated again for a breath the
racial instinct arose as usual to decide the issue

Taking a dime from his pocket he tossed it lightly in the air
and waited for it to fall

Heads for me tails for Fletcher

The coin spun for an instant in the gloom above him and then
dropped noiselessly to the floor When he lifted the lantern and
bent over it he saw that the head lay uppermost



CHAPTER VIII In Which Christopher Triumphs

When he entered the house a little later Cynthia met him in the
kitchen doorway with an anxious frown

I heard a noise Christopher What was it

A man wanted me about something How is mother resting

Not well Her dreams trouble her She grows weaker every day
and the few hours she insists upon spending in her chair tire her
dreadfully

There is nothing that she needs you say

No nothing She has never felt our poverty for an instant

The furrow between his eyebrows grew deeper

And you he asked abruptly regarding her fixedly with his
intent gaze What under heaven are you up to at this hour

Glancing down at the ironingboard before her she flushed
painfully through the drawn grayness of her face

I had a little ironing to do she answered and I wanted it
all finished tonight Mother needs me in the day

Pushing her aside he seized the iron and ran it in a few hasty
strokes over the roughdry garment which she had spread on the
board Go to bed and leave these things alone he insisted

Oh Christopher youll spoil it cried Cynthia clutching his
arm

He returned the iron to the stand and met her reproachful look
with a gesture of annoyance Well Im going to sleep if you
arent he said and treading as lightly as possible in his
heavy boots went along the little platform and upstairs to his
garret room

Once inside he undressed hastily and flung himself upon the bed
but his thoughts spun like a top and wild visions of Will of
Fletcher and of Molly Peterkin whirled confusedly through his
brain When at last he lost consciousness for a time it was to
dream restlessly of the cry of a hare that the hounds had caught
and mangled The scream of the creature came to him from a thick
wood which was intersected by innumerable small green paths and
when he tried vainly to go to the rescue he lost himself again
and again in the wilderness of trails Back and forth he turned
in the twilight crushing down the underbrush and striking in a
frenzy at the forked boughs the trees wrapped about him while
suddenly the piteous voice became that of a woman in distress
Then with a great effort he fought his way through the wood to
see the mangled hare change slowly into Maria Fletcher who
opened her eyes to ask him why he hunted her to death

He awoke in a cold sweat and sitting up in bed leaned for air
toward the open window A dull ache gnawed at his heart and his
lips were parched as if from fever Again it seemed to him that
Maria entreated him across the distance


When he came down at sunrise he found Jerry Green awaiting him
with the horses and learned in answer to his questions that the
lovers had taken a light wagon at the crossroads and driven on
to town

They were that bent on gittin thar that they couldnt even wait
for the stage  the man told him Well theyre a merry pair
an I hope good will come of itseein as taint no harm to
hope

Oh they think so now at any rate Christopher replied as he
turned away to unharness the patient horses

At breakfast an hour or two later he learned that his mother
was in one of her high humours and that awaking early and
prattling merrily of the past she insisted that they should
dress her immediately in her black brocade When the meal was
over he carried her from her bed to the old oak chair in which
she managed to keep upright among her pillows Her gallant spirit
was still youthful and undaunted and the many infirmities of her
body were powerless to distort the cheerful memories behind her
sightless eyes

Leaving her presently after a careless chat about the foibles of
Bolivar Blake he took his hoe from an outhouse and went to
grub the young weeds from the tobacco which had now reached
its luxuriant August height By noon his days work on the crop
was over and he was resting for a moment in the shadow of a
locust tree by the fence when he heard rapid footsteps
approaching in the new road and Bill Fletcher threw himself over
the crumbling rails and came panting into the strip of shade At
sight of the mans face Christopher flung his hoe out into the
field where it bore down a giant plant and bracing his body
against the tree prepared himself to withstand the shock of the
first blow but the other after glaring at him for a breathless
instant fell back and rapped out a single thundering oath You
hellhound This is all your doing

Throwing off the words with a gesture of his arm Christopher
stared coolly into the others distorted face then yielding to
the moments vindictive impulse he broke into a sneering laugh

So you have heard the good news he inquired lightly

Before the rage in the old mans eyesbefore the convulsed
features and the quivering limbshe felt a savage joy suddenly
take possession of him

Its all your doing every last bit of it repeated Fletcher
hoarsely and Ill live to pay you back if I hang for it in the
end

Go ahead then retorted Christopher you might as well hang
for a sheep as for a lamb you know

Oh you think Im fooling said the other wiping a fleck of
foam from his mouth but youll find out better some day unless
the devil gets you mighty quick Youve made that boy a scamp and
a drunkard and now youve gone and married him to a He
swallowed the words and stood gasping above his loosened collar

Christopher paled slightly beneath his sunburn then as he
recovered his assurance a brutal smile was sketched about his
mouth

Come come go easy he protested flippantly theres such a
thing you remember as the pot calling the kettle black

His gay voice fell strangely on the others husky tones and for
the moment in spite of his earthstained hands and his clothes
of coarse blue jean he might have been a man of the world
condescending to a peasant It was at such times when a raw
emotion found expression in the primitive lives about him that
he realised most vividly the gulf between him and his neighbours
To his superficial unconcern they presented the sincerity of
naked passion

Youve made the boy what he is repeated the old man in a
quiver from head to foot Youve done your level best to send
him to the devil

Well he had a pretty good start it seems before I ever laid
eyes on him

You set out to ruin him from the first and I watched you went
on Fletcher choking over each separate word before he uttered
it my eye was on your game and if you were anything but the
biggest villain on earth I could have stopped it But for you
hed be a decent chap this very minute

And the pattern of his grandfather sneered Christopher

Fletcher raised his arm for a blow and then let it fall limply to
his side Oh Im done with you now and Im done with your
gang he said Play your devils tricks as much as you please
they wont touch me If that boy sets foot on my land again Ill
horsewhip him as I would a hound Let him see wholl feed him now
when he comes to starve

Catching his breath Christopher stared at him an instant in
silence then he spoke in a voice which had grown serious

The more fool you then he said The chaps your grandson
and hes a better one than you deserve Whatever he is I tell
you now hes a long sight too good for such as youand so is
Molly Peterkin for that matter Heavens above What are you that
you should become a stickler for honesty in others Do you think
Ive forgotten that you drove my father to his grave and that
the very land you live on you stole from me Pshaw It takes more
than twenty years to bury a thing like that you fool

Fletcher looked helplessly round for a weapon and catching sight
of the hoe raised it in his hands but Christopher seizing it
roughly from him tossed it behind him in the little path

Ill have none of that added the young man grimly

Youre a liar as your father was before you burst out
Fletcher swallowing hard and as for that scamp youve gone and
sent to hell you can let him starve or not jest as you please
He has made his choice between us and he can stick to it till he
rots in the poorhouse Much good youll do him in the end I
reckon

Well just now it seems he hasnt chosen either of us remarked
Christopher cooling rapidly as the others anger grew red hot
It rather looks as if hed chosen Molly Peterkin

Damn you gasped Fletcher putting up a nerveless hand to tear
his collar apart while a purple flush rose slowly from his
throat to his forehead If you name that huzzy to me again Ill
thrash you within an inch of your life

Lets try it suggested Christopher in an irritating drawl

Oh Im used to bullies like you pursued the old man I know
the kind of brute that thinks he can knock his way into heaven
Your father was jest sech another and if you come to die a crazy
drunkard like him itll be about the end that you deserve

An impatient frown drew Christophers brows together and
picking up the hoe he walked leisurely out into the field

Well I cant stop to hear your opinion of me he observed
Youll have to keep it until another time and breaking into a
careless whistle he strode off between the tobacco furrows on
his way to bring the old mare from the pasture

A little later alone with the broad white noon and the stillness
of the meadow his gay whistle ended abruptly on his lips and the
old sullen frown contracted his heavy brows It was in vain that
he tried to laugh away the depression of the moment the white
glare of the fields and the perfume of wild flowers blooming in
hot sunshine produced in him a sensation closely akin to physical
nauseaa disgust of himself and of the life and the humanity
that he had known What was it all worth after all And what of
satisfaction was there to be found in the thing he sought
Fletchers face rose suddenly before him and when he tried to
banish the memory the effort that he made brought but the more
distinctly to his eyes the coarse bloated features with the
swollen veins across the nose Trivial recollections returned to
annoy himthe way the man sucked in his breath when he was
angry and the ceaseless twitching of the small muscles above his
bloodshot eyes Pshaw What business is it of mine he
questioned angrily What am I to the man that I cannot escape
the disgust that he arouses Is it possible that I should be
haunted forever by a face I hate There are times when I could
kill him simply because of the repulsion that I feel As for the
boylet him marry a dozen Molly Peterkinswho cares Not I
surely When he turns upon his grandfather and they fall to
gnawing at each others bones the better I shall be pleased He
shook his head impatiently but the oppression which in some
vague way he associated with the white heat and the scent of wild
flowers still weighed heavily upon his thoughts Is it possible
that after all that has happened I am not yet satisfied he
asked with annoyance

For awhile he lingered by the little brook in the pasture and
then slipping the bridle on the old mare returned slowly to the
house At the bars he met Sol Peterkin who had hurried over in
evident consternation to deliver his news

Good Lord Mr Christopher What do you think that gal of mine
has gone and done now

Christopher slid the topmost bar from its place and lifted his
head

Dont tell me that shes divorced already he returned Why
the last I heard of her she had run off this morning to marry
Will Fletcher

Thats it suh thats it said Sol Im meanin the marriage
Well well it does seem that you cant settle down an begin to
say yo grace over one trouble befo a whole batch lights upon
you To think arter the way Ive sweated an delved to be
honest that a gal of mine should tie me hand an foot to Bill
Fletcher

In spite of his moodiness the humour of the situation struck
home to Christopher and throwing back his head he burst into a
laugh

Oh you neednt poke yo fun suh continued Sol Money is a
mighty good thing but you cant put it in the blood like you
kin meanness All Bill Fletchers riches aint soaked in him
blood an bone but his meanness is an that thar meanness goes
a long sight further than his money Thar aint much sto set by
honesty in this here world suh an you kin buy a bigger chaw of
tobaccy with five cents than you kin with all the virtue of Moses
on his Mount but all the same its a mighty good thing to rest
yo head on when you go to bed an I aint sure but it makes
easier lyin than a linen pillowslip an a white goose tick

Oh I dare say interrupted Christopher but now that its
over we must make the best of it She didnt marry Bill Fletcher
after all you know

He checked himself with a start and the bridle slipped from his
arm to the ground for his name was called suddenly in a high
voice from the house and as he swung himself over the bars Lila
came running barehead across the yard

Christopher she cried we could not find you and Bill
Fletcher has talked to mother like a madman Come quickly She
has fainted

Before she had finished he had dashed past her and through the
house into the little parlour where the old lady sat erect and
unconscious in her Elizabethan chair

I found her like this said Lila weeping We heard loud
voices and then a scream and when we rushed in the man left and
she sat looking straight ahead like thislike this

Throwing himself upon his knees beside the chair Christopher
caught his mother to his breast and turned angrily upon the
women

Has nothing been done Where is the doctor he cried

Jim has gone for him Here let me take her said Cynthia
unclasping his arms There stand back She is not dead In a
little while she will come to herself again

Rising from the floor he stood motionless in the center of the
room where the atmosphere was heavy with the fragrance of
camphor and tearoses A broad strip of sunshine was at his feet
and in the twisted aspen beside the window a catbird was singing
These remained with him for years afterward and with them the
memory of the blind woman sitting stiffy erect and staring
vacantly into his face

He has told her everything said Cynthiaafter twenty years




BOOK IV The Awakening


CHAPTER I The Unforeseen

The road was steep and Christopher descending from the big
lumbering cart left the oxen to crawl slowly up the incline It
was a windy afternoon in March and he was returning from a trip
to Farrars mill which was reached by a lane that branched off a
halfmile or so from the crossroads A blue sky shone brightly
through the leafless boughs above him and along the little
wayside path tufts of dandelion were blooming in the red dust
The wind which blew straight toward him from the opening beyond
the strip of wood in which he walked brought the fresh scent of
the upturned fields and of the swelling buds putting out with the
warm sunshine In his own veins he felt also that the blood had
stirred and that strange quickening impulse which comes with
the rising sap alike to a man and to a tree worked restlessly in
his limbs at the touch of spring Nature was alive again and he
felt vaguely that in the resurrection surrounding him he must
have his partthat in him as well as in the earth the spirit of
life must move and put forth in gladness A flock of swallows
passed suddenly like a streak of smoke on the blue sky overhead
and as his eyes followed them the old roving instinct pulled at
his heart To be up and away to drink life to its dregs and come
home for rest were among the impulses which awoke with the
return of spring

The oxen moved behind him at a leisurely pace and outstripping
them in a little while he had turned at a sudden opening in the
trees into the main road when to his surprise he saw a woman
in black followed by a small yellow dog walking in front of him
along the grassy path As he caught sight of her a strong gust of
wind swept down the road wrapping her skirt closely about her
and whirling a last years leaf into her face For a moment she
paused and throwing back her head drank the air like water
then holding firmly to her hat she started on again at her
rapid pace In the ease with which she moved against the wind in
the selfpossession of her carriage and most of all in the grace
with which she lifted her long black skirt made he could see
after the fashion of the outside world he realised at once that
she was a stranger to the neighbourhood No woman whom he had
knownnot even Lilahad this same light yet energetic walka
walk in which every line in her body moved in accord with the
buoyant impulse that controlled her step As he watched her he
recalled instantly the flight of a swallow in the air for her
passage over the ground was as direct and beautiful as a birds

When he neared her she turned suddenly and as she flung back
her short veil he saw to his amazement that he faced Maria
Fletcher

So you have forgotten me she said with a smile Or have I
changed so greatly that my old friends do not know me

She held out her hand and while a tremor ran through him he
kept her bared palm for an instant in his own

You dropped from the sky he answered steadying his voice with
an effort You have taken my breath away and I cannot speak

Then letting her hand fall he stood looking at her in a wonder
that shone in his face for to the Maria whom he had known the
woman before him now bore only the resemblance that the finished
portrait bears to the charcoal sketch and the years which had so
changed and softened her had given her girlish figure a nobility
that belonged to the maturity she had not reached It was not
that she had grown beautifulwhen he sought for physical changes
he found only that her cheek was rounder her bosom fuller but
if she still lacked the ruddy attraction of mere fleshandblood
loveliness she had gained the deeper fascination which is the
outward accompaniment of a fervent spirit Her eyes her voice
her gestures were all attuned to the inner harmony which he
recognised also in the smile with which she met his words and
the charm that she irradiated was that rarest of all physical
gifts the power of the flesh to express the soul that it
envelops

The wind or the meeting with himself had brought a faint flush to
her cheek but without lowering her eyes she stood regarding him
with her warm grave smile The pale oval of her face framed in
the loosened waves of her black hair had for him all the
remoteness that surrounded her memory and yet though he knew it
not the appeal she made to him now and had made long ago was
that he recognised in her however dumbly a creature born like
himself with the power to experience the fulness of joy or
grief

So I have taken your breath away she said and you have
forgotten Agag

Agag he turned with a question and followed her glance in the
direction of the dog It is the brute you saved

Only he is not a bruteI have seen many men who were more of
one Look He recognises you He has followed me everywhere but
he doesnt like Europe and if you could have seen his joy when
we got out at the crossroads and he smelt the familiar country
It was almost as great as mine

As yours Then you no longer hate it

I have learned to love it in the last six years she answered
as I have learned to love many things that I once hated Oh
this wind is good when it blows over the ploughed fields and yet
between city streets it would bring only dust and discomfort

She threw back her head looking up into the sky where a bird
passed

Will you get into the cart now he asked after a moment
vaguely troubled by the silence and by the gentleness of her
upward look or do you wish to walk to the top of the hill

She turned and moved quickly on again

It is such a little way let us walk she replied and then
with a laugh she offered an explanation of her presence I wrote
twice but I had no answer she said then I decided to come
and telegraphed but they handed me my telegram and my last
letter at the crossroads Can something have happened do you
think or is it merely carelessness that keeps them from sending
for the mail

I hardly know but they are all alive at least You have come
straight fromwhere

From abroad I lived there for six years first in one place
then in anotherchiefly in Italy My husband died eighteen
months ago but I stayed on with his people It seemed then that
they needed me most but one can never tell and I may have made
a mistake in not coming home sooner

I think you did he said quietly running the end of his long
whip through his fingers

She flashed a disturbed glance at him

Is it possible that you are keeping something from me Is any
one ill

Not that I have heard of but I never see any of them you know
except your brother

And he is married They told me so at the crossroads I cant
understand why they did not let me know

It was very suddenthey went to Washington

How queer Who is the girl I wonder

Her name was Molly Peterkinold Sols daughter you may
remember him

She shook her head No Ive lived here so little you see What
is she like

A beauty with blue eyes and yellow hair

Indeed And are they happy He laughed They are in loveor
were six months ago

You are cynical But do they live at the Hall

Not yet Your grandfather has not spoken to Will since the
marriage and that was last August

Where under heaven do they live then

On a little farm he has given them adjoining Sols I believe he
means that they shall raise tobacco for a living

She made a gesture of distress Oh I ought to have come home
long ago

What difference would that have made you could have done
nothing A thunderbolt falling at his feet doesnt sober a man
when he is in love

I might have helpedone never knows At least I should have
been at my post for after all the ties of blood are the
strongest claims we have

Why should they be he questioned with sudden bitterness You
are more like that swallow flying up there than you are like any
Fletcher that ever lived

She smiled I thought so once she answered but now I know
better The likeness must be there and I am going to find it

You will never find it he insisted for there is nothing of
them in younothing

You dont like them I remember

Nor do you

A laugh broke from her and humour rippled in her eyes

So you still persist in the truth and in the plain truth she
exclaimed

Then it is so you confess it

No no no she protested Why I love them allall do you
hear and I love Will more than the rest of them put together

He looked away from her and then turning waited for the oxen
to reach the summit of the hill

Youd better get in now I think he said there is a long
walk ahead of us and if my team is slow it is sure also

As he brought the oxen to a halt she laid her hand for an
instant on his arm and mounting lightly upon the wheel stepped
into the cart

Now give me Agag she said and he handed her the little dog
before he took up the ropes and settled himself beside her on the
drivers seat You look like one of the disinherited princesses
in the old stories mother tells he observed

A puzzled wonder was in her face as she turned toward him

Who are you And what has Blake Hall to do with your family
she asked

Only that it was named after us We used to live there

Within your recollection

He nodded with his eyes on the slow oxen

Then you have not always been a farmer

Ever since I was ten years old

I cant understand I cant understand she said perplexed
You are like no one about here you are like no one I have ever
seen

Then I must be like you he returned bluntly

Like me Oh heavens no you would make three of mebody
brain and soul I believe when I think of it that you are the
biggest man Ive ever knownand by that I dont mean in height
for I have seen men with a greater number of physical inches
Inches somehow have very little to do with the impressionand
so has muscle strong as yours is It is simple bigness that I am
talking about and it was the first thing I noticed in you

At the crossroads he asked and instantly regretted his
words

No not at the crossroads she answered smiling You have a
good memory but mine is better I saw you once on a June
morning when I was riding along the road with the chestnuts and
you were standing out in the field

I did not see you or I should have remembered he said quietly

Silence fell between them and he was conscious in every fiber of
his bodythat he had never been so close to her beforehad
never felt the touch of her arm upon his own nor the folds of
her skirt brushing against his knees A gust of wind whipped the
end of her veil into his face and when she turned to recapture
it he felt her warm breath on his cheek The sense of her
nearness pervaded him from head to foot and an unrest like that
produced by the spring wind troubled his heart He did not look
at her and yet he saw her full dark eyes and the curve of her
white throat more distinctly than he beheld the blue sky at which
he gazed Was it possible that she too shared his disquietude
he wondered or was the silence that she kept as undisturbed as
her tranquil pose

I should not have forgotten it he repeated presently turning
to meet her glance

She started and looked away from the landscape You have long
memories in this county I know she said So few things happen
that it becomes a religion to cherish the little incidents It
may be that I too have inherited something of this for I
remember very clearly the few months I spent here

You remembered them even while you were away

Why not she asked It is not the moving about the strange
places one sees nor the people one meets that really count in
life you know

What is it he questioned abruptly

She hesitated as if trying to put her thoughts more clearly into
words

I think it is the things one learns she said the places in
which we take root and grow and the people who teach us what is
really worth whilepatience and charity and the beauty there
is in the simplest and most common lives when they are lived
close to Nature

In driving the plough or in picking the suckers from a tobacco
plant he added scornfully

In those things yes and in any life that is good and true
and natural

Well I have lived near enough to Nature to hate her with all my
might he answered not without bitterness Why there are
times when Id like to kick every ploughed field I see out into
eternity Tobaccogrowing is one of the natural things I
suppose but if you want to see any beauty in it you must watch
it from a shady road When you get in the midst of it youll find
it coarse and sticky and given over generally to worms I have
spent my whole life working on it and to this day I never look
at a plant nor smell a pipe without a shiver of disgust The
things I want are over there he finished pointing with his
whiphandle to the clear horizon I want the excitement that
makes ones blood run like wine

Battle murder and all that I suppose she said smiling

War and fame and love he corrected

Her face had grown grave and in the thoughtful look she turned
upon him it seemed to him that he saw a purpose slowly take form
So earnest was her gaze that at last his own fell before it at
which she murmured a confused apology like one forcibly awakened
from a dream

I was wondering what that other life would have made of you
she said the life that I have known and wearied ofa life of
petty shams of sham love of sham hate of sham religion It is
all little you know and it takes a little soul to keep alive in
it I craved it once myself and it took six years of artifice to
teach me that I loved a plain truth better than a pretty lie

He had been looking at the strong white hand lying in her lap
and now with a laugh he held out his own bronzed and roughened
one

There is the difference he said do you see it

A wave of sympathy swept over her expressive face and with one
of her impulsive gestures which seemed always to convey some
spiritual significance she touched his outstretched palm with
her fingers How full of meaning it is she replied for it
tells of quiet days in the fields and of a courage that has not
faltered before the thing it hates When I look at it it makes me
feel very humbleand yet very proud too that some day I may be
your friend

He shook his head with his eyes on the sun which was slowly
setting

That is out of the question he answered You cannot be my
friend except for this single day If I meet you tomorrow I
shall not know you

Because I am a Fletcher she asked wondering

Because you are a Fletcher and because you would find me worse
than a Fletcher

Riddles riddles she protested laughing and I was always
dull at guessingbut I may as well warn you now that I have come
home determined to make a friend of every mortal in the county
man and beast

Youll do it he answered seriously Im the only thing about
here that will resist you Youll be everybodys friend but
mine

She caught and held his gaze Let us see she responded
quietly

For a time they were silent and spreading out her skirt she
made a place for the dog upon it The noise of the heavy wheels
on the rocky bed of the road grew suddenly louder in his ears
and he realised with a pang that every jolt of the cart carried
him nearer the end With the thought there came to him a wish
that life might pause at the instantthat the earth might be
arrested in its passage and leave him forever aware of the warm
contact that thrilled through him They had already passed
Weatherbys lane and presently the chimneys of Blake Hall
appeared above the distant trees When they reached the abandoned
icepond Christopher spoke with an attempted carelessness

It would perhaps be better for you to walk the rest of the way
he said Trouble might be made in the beginning if your
grandfather were to know that I brought you over

Youre right I think she said and rising as the cart
stopped she followed him down into the road Then with a word or
two of thanks she smiled brightly and calling the dog passed
rapidly into the twilight which stretched between him and a
single shining window that was visible in the Hall

After she had quite disappeared he still stood motionless by the
icepond staring into the dusk that had swallowed her up from
his gaze So long did he remain there that at last the oxen tired
of waiting and began to move slowly on along the sunken road
Then starting abruptly from his meditation he picked up the
ropes that trailed before him on the ground and fell into his
accustomed walk beside the cart At the moment it seemed to him
that his whole life was shattered into pieces by the event of a
single instant Something stronger than himself had shaken the
foundations of his nature and he was not the man that he had
been before He was like one born blind who when his eyes are
opened is ignorant that the light which dazzles him is merely
the shining of the sun

When he came into the house after putting up the oxen Cynthia
commented upon the dazed look that he wore

You must have fallen asleep on the way home she remarked

It is the glare of the lamp he answered I have just come out
of the darkness and before sitting down to his supper he
opened the door and listened for the sound of his mothers voice

She is asleep then he said coming back again Has she
recognised either of you today

No she wanders again The present is nothing to her any
longerit is all blotted out with everything that Fletcher told
her She asks for father constantly and the only thing that
interested her was when Jim went in and talked to her about
farming She is quite rational except that she has entirely
forgotten the last twenty years and just before falling asleep
she laughed heartily over some old stories of Grandpa Bolivars

Then I may see her for a minute

If you wish ityes

Passing along the hall he entered the little chamber where the
old lady lay asleep in her tester bed Her fine white hair was
brushed over the pillow and her drawn and yellowed face wore a
placid and childlike look As he paused beside her a faint smile
flickered about her mouth and her delicate hand trembled slightly
upon the counterpane Her dreams had evidently brought her
happiness and as he stood looking down upon her the wish entered
his heart that he might change his young life for her old one
that he might become in her place half dead and done with all
that the future could bring of either joy or grief



CHAPTER II Maria Returns to the Hall

Through the grove of oaks a single lighted window glimmered now
red now yellow as lamplight struggled with firelight inside
and Maria walking rapidly through the dark felt that the
comfortable warmth shining on the panes was her first welcome
home The night had grown chilly and she gathered her wraps
closely together as she hastened along the gravelled drive and
ran up the broad stone steps to the closed door There was no
answer to her knock and finding that the big silver handle of
the door turned easily she entered the hall and passed
cautiously through the dusk that enveloped the great staircase
Her foot was on the first step when a stream of light issued
suddenly from the diningroom and turning she stood for an
instant hesitating upon the threshold A lamp burned dimly in the
center of the old mahogany table where a scant supper for two
had been hastily laid In the fireplace a single hickory log sent
out a shower of fine sparks which hovered a moment in the air
before they were sucked up by the big stone chimney The room was
just as Maria had left it six years before and yet in some
unaccountable fashion it seemed to have lost the dignity which
she remembered as its one redeeming feature Nothing was changed
that she could seethe furniture stood in the same places the
same hard engravings hung on the discoloured wallsbut as she
glanced wonderingly about her she was aware of a shock greater
than the one she had nerved herself to withstand It was after
all the atmosphere that depressed her she concluded with her
next thoughtthe general air of slovenly unrefinement revealed
in the details of the room and of the carelessly laid table

While she still hesitated uncertainly on the threshold the
pantry door opened noiselessly and Miss Saidie appeared carrying
a glass dish filled with preserved watermelon rind At sight of
Maria she gave a start and a little scream and the dish fell
from her hands and crashed upon the floor

Sakes alive Is that you Maria

Hastily crossing the room Maria caught the little woman in her
arms and kissed her twice

Why you poor thing Ive frightened you to death she said
with a laugh

You did give me a turn thats so replied Miss Saidie as she
wiped the moisture from her crimson face Its been so long
since anybodys come here that Malindyshes the only servant
weve got nowwas actually afraid to answer your knock Then
when I came in and saw you standing by the door I declare it
almost took my breath clean away I thought for a moment you were
a ghost you looked so dead white in that long black dress

Oh Im flesh and blood never fear Maria assured her Much
more flesh and blood too than I was when I went awaybut Ive
made you spill all your preserves What a shame

Miss Saidie glanced down a little nervously I must wipe it up
before Brother Bill comes in she said it frets him so to see
a waste

Picking up a dustcloth she had left on a chair she got down on
her knees and began mopping up the sticky syrup which trickled
along the floor He hates so to throw away anything she
pursued panting softly from her exertions that if he were to
see this I believe it would upset him for a week Oh he didnt
use to be like that I know she added meeting Marias amazed
look and it does seem strange for Im sure he gets richer and
richer every daybut its the gospel truth that every cent he
makes he hugs closer than he did the last I declare Ive seen
him haggle for an hour over the price of salt and it turns him
positively sick to see anything but specked potatoes on the
table He kinder thinks his money is all hes got I reckon so
he holds on to it like grim death

But it isnt all he has Wheres Will

Miss Saidie shook her head with a glance in the direction of the
door

Dont mention him if you want any peace she said rising with
difficulty to her feet Your grandpa has never so much as laid
eyes on him sence he gave him that little wornout place side by
side with Sol Peterkinand told him hed shoot him if he ever
caught sight of him at the Hall Youve come home to awful worry
thars no doubt of it Maria

Oh oh oh sighed Maria and tossing her hat upon the sofa
pressed her fingers on her temples With the firelight thrown
full on the ivory pallor of her face the effect she produced was
almost unreal in its intensity of black and whitean absence of
colour which had in it all the warmth and the animation we are
used to associate with brilliant hues A peculiar mellowness of
temperament the expression of a passionate nature confirmed in
sympathy shone in the softened fervour of her look as she bent
her eyes thoughtfully upon the flames

Something must be done for Will she said turning presently
This cant go on another day

Miss Saidie caught her breath sharply and hastened to the head
of the table as Fletchers heavy footsteps crossed the hall

For heavens sake be careful she whispered warningly jerking
her head nervously from side to side

Fletcher entered with a black look slamming the door heavily
behind him then suddenly catching sight of Maria he stopped
short on the threshold and stared at her with hanging jaws

Ill be blessed if it aint Maria he broke out at last

Maria went toward him and held out her cheek for his kiss

Ive surprised you almost as much as I did Aunt Saidie she
said with her cheerful laugh which floated a little strangely
on the sullen atmosphere

Catching her by the shoulder Fletcher drew her into the circle
of the lamplight where he stood regarding her in gloomy silence

Youve filled out considerable he remarked as he released her
at the end of his long scrutiny But thar was room for it
heaven knows Youll never be the sort that a man smacks his lips
over I reckon but youre a plum sight better looking than you
were when you went away

Maria winced quickly as if he had struck her then regaining her
composure almost instantly she drew back her chair with a casual
retort

But I didnt come home to set the county afire she said Why
Aunt Saidie what queer coarse china Whats become of the
whiteandgold set I used to like

A purple flush mounted slowly to Miss Saidies forehead

I was afraid it would chip so I packed it away she explained
Me and Brother Bill aint used to any better than this so we
dont notice Things will have to be mighty fine now I reckon
since youve got back You were always particular about looks I
remember

Was I asked Maria curiously glancing down into the plate
before her For the last few years she had schooled herself to
despise what she called the silly luxuries of living and yet
the heavy white cup which Miss Saidie handed her and the sound
of Fletcher drinking his coffee aroused in her the old poignant
disgust

I dont think Im over particular now she added pleasantly
but we may as well get out the other china tomorrow I think

You wont find many fancy ways hereeh Saidie inquired
Fletcher with a chuckle Thars been a precious waste of
victuals on this place but its got to stop I aint so sure you
did a wise thing in coming back he finished abruptly turning
his bloodshot eyes on his granddaughter

You arent Well I am laughed Maria and I promise you that
you shant find me troublesome except in the matter of china

Then you must have changed your skin I reckon

Changed Why I have of course Six years isnt a day you
know and Ive been in many places Then as a hint of interest
awoke in his eyes she talked on rapidly describing her years
abroad and the strange cities in which she had lived Before she
had finished Fletcher had pushed his plate away and sat
listening with the ghost of a smile upon his face

Well youll do I reckon he said at the end and pushing
back his chair he rose from his place and stamped out into the
hall

When he had gone into his sittingroom and closed the door behind
him Miss Saidie nodded smilingly as she measured out the
servants sugar in a cracked saucer Hes brighter than Ive
seen him for days she said and now if you want to go
upstairs Malindy has jest lighted your fire She had to carry
the wood up while we were at supper so Brother Bill wouldnt see
it He hates even to burn a log though they are strewn round
loose all over the place

Maria was feeding Agag on the hearth and she waited until he
had finished before she took up her hat and wraps and went toward
the door Oh you neednt bother to light me she said waving
Miss Saidie back when she would have followed Why I could find
my way over this house at midnight without a candle Then with
a cheerful Goodnight she called Agag and went up the dusky
staircase

A wood fire was burning in her room and she stood for a moment
looking pensively into the flames a faint smile sketched about
her mouth Then throwing off her black dress in the desire for
freedom she clasped her hands above her head and paced slowly up
and down the shadowy length of the room In the flowing measure
of her walk in the free almost defiant movement of her
upraised arms and in the ample lines of her throat and bosom
which melted gradually into the low curves of her hips she might
have stood for an incarnation of vital force One felt
instinctively that her personality would be active rather than
passivethat the events which she attracted to herself would be
profoundly emotional in their fulfilment

Notwithstanding the depressing hour she had just passed and the
old vulgarity which had shocked her with a new violence she was
conscious moving to and fro in the shadows of a strange
happinessof a warmth of feeling which pervaded her from head to
foot which fluttered in her temples and burned like firelight in
her open palms The place was home to her she realised at last
and the surroundings of her married lifethe foreign towns and
the enchanting Italian sceneryshowed in her memory with a
distant and alien beauty Here was what she loved for here was
her right her heritagethe desolate red roads the luxuriant
tobacco fields the primitive and ignorant people In her heart
there was no regret for any past that she had known for over the
wild country stretching about her now there hung a romantic and
mysterious haze

A little later she was aroused from her reverie by Miss Saidie
who came in with a lighted lamp in her hand

Dont you need a light Maria I never could abide to sit in the
dark

Oh yes bring it in There put it on the bureau and sit down
by the fire for I want to talk to you No Im not a bit tired
I am only trying to fit myself again in this room Why I dont
believe youve changed a pin in the pincushion since I went
away

Miss Saidie dusted the top of the bureau with her apron before
she placed the tall glass lamp upon it

Thar warnt anybody to stay in it she answered as she sat
down in a deep cretonnecovered chair and pushed back the
hickory log with her foot I declare Maria I dont see what
you want to traipse around with that little poorfolksy yaller
dog for He puts me in mind of the one that old blind nigger up
the road used to have

Does he asked Maria absently in the voice of one whose
thoughts are hopelessly astray

She was standing by the window holding aside the curtain of
flowered chintz and after a moment she added curiously Theres
a light in the fields Aunt Saidie What does it mean

Crossing the room Miss Saidie followed the gesture with which
Maria pointed into the night

Thats on the Blake place she said it must be Mr
Christopher moving about with his lantern

You call him Mr Christopher

Oh it slipped out His fathers name was Christopher before
him and I used to open the gate for him when I was a child Many
and many a time the old gentlemans given me candy out of his
pocket or a quarter to buy a present and one Christmas he
brought me a real wax doll from the city He wasnt old then I
can tell you and he was as handsome as if he had stepped out of
a fashion plate Why young Mr Christopher cant hold a candle
to him for looks

He was a gentleman then I mean the old man

Who Mr Christophers father I dont reckon thar was a freer
or a finer between here and London

Marias gaze was still on the point of light which twinkled
faintly here and there in the distant field

Then how in heavens name did he come to this she asked in
a voice that was hardly louder than a whisper

I never knew I never knew protested Miss Saidie going back
to her chair beside the hearth Brother Bill and he hate each
other worse than death and it was Wills fancy for Mr
Christopher that brought on this awful trouble For a time I
declare it looked as if the boy was really bewitched and they
were together morning noon and night Your grandpa never got
over it and I believe he blames Mr Christopher for every last
thing thats happenedMolly Peterkin and all

Molly Peterkin repeated Maria inquiringly Why how absurd
And after all what is the matter with the girl Dropping the
curtain she came over to the fire and sat listening attentively
while Miss Saidie told in spasmodic jerks and pauses the
foolish story of Wills marriage

Your grandpa will never forgive himnever never He has turned
him out for good and all and he talks now of leaving every cent
of his money to foreign missions

Well well see said Maria soothingly Ill go over there to
morrow and talk with Will and then Ill try to bring grandfather
to some kind of reason He cant let them starve rich as he is
theres no sense in thatand if the worst comes I can at least
share the little I have with them It may supply them with bread
if Molly will undertake to churn her own butter

Then your money went too

The greater part of it Jack was fond of wild schemes you know
I left it in his hands She had pronounced the dead mans name
so composedly that Miss Saidie after an instants hesitation
brought herself to an allusion to the girls loss

How you must miss him dear she ventured timidly even if he
wasnt everything he should have been to you he was still your
husband

Yes he was my husband assented Maria quietly

You were so brave and so patient and you stuck by him to the
last as a wife ought to do Then thars not even a child left to
you now

Maria turned slowly toward her and then looked away again into
the fire The charred end of a lightwood knot had fallen on the
stones and picking it up she threw it back into the flames
For a year before his death his mind was quite gone she said
in a voice that quivered slightly he had to be taken to an
asylum but I went with him and nursed him till he died There
were times when he would allow no one else to enter his room or
even bring him his meals I have sat by him for two days and
nights without sleeping and though he did not recognise me he
would not let me stir from my place

And yet he treated you very badlyeven his family said so

That is all over now and we were both to blame I owed him
reparation and I made it thank God at the last

As she raised her bare arms to the cushioned back of her chair
Miss Saidie caught a glimpse of a deep white scar which ran in a
jagged line above her elbow

Oh it is nothing nothing said Maria hastily clasping her
hands again upon her knees That part of my life is over and
done with and may rest in peace I forgave him then and he
forgives me now One always forgives when one understands you
know and we both understand todayhe no less than I The chief
thing was that we made a huge irretrievable mistakethe mistake
that two people make when they think that love can be coddled and
nursed like a domestic petwhen they forget that it goes wild
and free and comes at no mans call Folly like that is its own
punishment I suppose

My dear my dear gasped Miss Saidie in awestricken sympathy
before the wild remorse in Marias voice

I did my duty as you call it I even clung to it desperately
and much as I hated it I never rebelled for a single instant
The nearest I came to loving him I think was when after our
terrible life together he lay helpless for a year and I was with
him day and night If I could have given him my strength then
brain and body I would have done it gladly and that agonised
compassion was the strongest feeling I ever had for him She
broke off for a long breath and sat looking earnestly at the
amazed little woman across from her You could never
understand she exclaimed impetuously but I must tell youI
must tell you because I cant live with you day after day and
know that there is an old dead lie between us I hate lies I
have had so many of them and I shall speak the truth hereafter
no matter what comes of it Anything is better than a long
wearing falsehood or than those hideous little shams that we
were always afraid to touch for fear they would melt and show us
our own nakedness That is what I loathe about my life and that
is what Ive done with now forever I am myself now for the first
time since I was born and at last I shall let my own nature
teach me how to live

Her intense pallor was illumined suddenly by a white flame
whether from the leaping of some inner emotion or from the
sinking firelight which blazed up fitfully Miss Saidie could not
tell As she turned her head with an impatient movement her black
hair slipped its heavy coil and spread in a shadowy mass upon her
bared shoulders

Im sure I dont know how it is said Miss Saidie wiping her
eyes But I cant see that it makes any difference whether you
were what they call in love or not so long as you were a good
wellbehaved wife I dont think a man troubles himself much
about a womans heart after hes put his wedding ring on her
finger and though I know of course that thars a lot of
nonsense spoken in courtship it seems to me they mostly take it
out in talking The wives that Ive seen are generally as anxious
about thar setting hens as they are about thar husbands hearts
and I reckon things are mighty near the same the world over

Without noticing her Maria went on feverishly speaking so low
at times that the other almost lost the words

It is such a relief to let it all out she said with a long
sighing breath and oh if I had loved him it would have been so
differentso different Then I might have saved him for what
evil is strong enough to contend against a love which would have
borne all things have covered all things

Rising from her chair she walked rapidly up and down and
pausing at last beside the window lifted the curtain and looked
out into the night

I might have saved him I know it now she repeated slowly or
had it been otherwise even in madness I would not have loosened
my arms and my service would have been the one passionate
delight left in my life They could never have torn him from my
bosom then and yet as it wasas it was She turned quickly
and coming back laid her hand on Miss Saidies arm It is such
a comfort to talk dear Aunt Saidie she added even though you
dont understand half that I say But you are goodso good and
now if youll lend me a nightgown Ill go to bed and sleep until
my trunks come in the morning Her voice had regained its old
composure and Miss Saidie looking back as she went for the
gown saw that she had begun quietly to braid her hair



CHAPTER III The Day Afterward

When Maria awoke the sun was full in her eyes and somewhere on
the lawn outside the first bluebird was whistling With a start
she sprang out of bed and dressed quickly by the wood fire which
Malindy had lighted Then before going downstairs she raised
the window and leaned out into the freshness of the morning
where a white mist glimmered in the hollows of the March
landscape In the distance she saw the smoking chimneys of the
Blake cottage very faint among the leafless trees and nearer at
hand men were moving back and forth in her grandfathers fields
Six years ago she would have found little beauty in so grave and
colourless a scene but today as she looked upon it a peace such
as she had never known possessed her thoughts The wisdom of
experience was hers now and with it she had gained something of
the deeper insight into nature which comes to the soul that is
reconciled with the unknown laws which it obeys

Going down a few moments later she found that breakfast was
already over and that Miss Saidie was washing the tea things at
the head of the bared table

Why it seems but a moment since I fell asleep said Maria as
she drew back her chair How long has grandfather been up

Since before daybreak He is just starting to town and hes in
a terrible temper because the last batch of butter aint up to
the mark he says Im sure I dont see why it aint for I
worked every pound of it with my own handsbut thar aint no
rule for pleasing men and never will be till God Almighty sets
the universe rolling upside down Thats the wagon you hear now
Thank heaven he wont be back till after dark

With a gesture of relief Maria applied herself to the buttered
waffles before her prepared evidently in her honour and then
after a short silence in which she appeared to weigh carefully
her unuttered words she announced her intention of paying
immediately her visit to Will and Molly

Oh you cant you cant groaned Miss Saidie nervously
mopping out the inside of a cup For heavens sake dont raise
another cloud of dust jest as were beginning to see clear
again

Now dont tell me I cant when I must responded Maria pushing
away her plate and rising from the table theres no such word
as cant when one has to you know Ill be back in two hours
at the most and oh with so much to tell you

After tying on her hat in the hall she looked in again to
lighten Miss Saidies foreboding by a tempting bait of news but
when she had descended the steps and walked slowly along the
drive under the oaks the assumed brightness of her look faded as
rapidly as the morning sunshine on the clay road before her It
was almost with dismay that she found herself covering the ground
between the Hall and Wills home and saw the shaded lane
stretching to the little farm adjoining Sol Peterkins

As she passed the store Mrs Spade who was selling white china
buttons to Eliza Field leaned over the counter and stared in
amazement through the open window

Bless my soul an body if thar aint old Fletchers
granddaughter come back she exclaimedholdin her head as
high as ever jest as if her husband hadnt beat her black an
blue Well well times have slid down hill sence I was a gal
an the women of today aint got the modesty they used to be
born with Why I remember the time when old Mrs Beale in the
next county used to go to bed for shame with a mustard plaster
every time her husband took a drop too much which he did every
blessed Saturday that he lived It tided him over the Sabbath
mighty well he used to say for he never could abide the sermons
of Mr Grant

Eliza dropped the buttons she had picked up and turned craning
her neck in the direction of Marias vanishing figure

What on earth has she gone down Sol Peterkins lane for she
inquired suspiciously

The Lord knows if its to visit her brother I may say its a
long ways mon Id do

She was always a queer gal even befo her marriageso strange
an faraway lookin that I declar it used to scare me half to
death to meet her all alone at dusk I never could help feelin
that she could bewitch a body if she wanted to with those
solemn black eyes

She aint bewitched me returned Mrs Spade decisively an
whats mo shes had too many misfortune come to her to make me
believe she aint done somethin to deserve em Thars mighty
few folks gets worse than they deserve in this world an when
you see a whole flock of troubles settle on a persons head you
may rest right sartain thars a long score of misbehaviours up
agin em Yes maam when I hear of a big misfortune happenin
to anybody that I know the first question that pops into my head
is I wonder if theyve broke the sixth this time or jest the
common seventh The best rule to follow accordin to my way of
thinkin is to make up yo mind right firm that no matter what
evil falls upon a person it aint nearly so bad as the good Lord
ought to have made it

Thats a real pious way of lookin at things I reckon sighed
Eliza deferentially as she fished five cents from the deep
pocket of her purple calico and slapped it down upon the counter
but we aint all such good churchgoers as you the mos the
pity

Oh Im moral an I make no secret of it replied Mrs Spade
Its writ plain all over me an it has been ever sence the day
that I was born Thats as moral lookin a baby as ever I saw
was what Doctor Pierson said to ma when I want mon two hours
old It was so then an its been so ever sence Virtue may not
take the place of beaux my po ma used to say but it will
ease her along mighty well without emYes the buttons are
five cents To be sure Ill watch out and let you hear if she
comes this way again

Maria meanwhile happily unconscious of the judgment of her
neighbours walked thoughtfully along the lane until she came in
sight of the small tumbleddown cottage which had been Fletchers
wedding gift to his grandson A man in blue jean clothes was
ploughing the field on the left of the road and it was only when
something vaguely familiar in his dejected attitude caused her to
turn for a second glance that she realised with a pang that he
was Will

At her startled cry he looked up from the horses he was driving
and then letting the ropes fall came slowly toward her across
the faint purple furrows All the boyish jauntiness she
remembered was gone from his appearance his reversion to the
family type had been complete and it came to her with a shock
that held her motionless that he stood today where her
grandfather had stood fifty years before

Will she gasped with an impulsive motherly movement of her
arms Rejecting her caress with an impatient shrug he stood
kicking nervously at a clod of earth his eyes wavering in a
dispirited survey of her face

Well it seems that we have both made a blamed mess of things
he said at last

Maria shook her head smiling hopefully Not too bad a mess to
straighten out dear she answered We must set to work at once
and begin to mend matters Ah if you had only written me how
things were

What was the use asked Will doggedly It was all grandpahe
turned out the devil himself and there was no putting up with
him Hell live forever too thats the worst of it

But you did anger him very much Willand you might so easily
have waited Surely you were both young enough

Oh it wasnt all about Molly you know when it comes to that
Long before I married he had made my life a burden to me It all
began with his insane jealousy of Christopher Blake

Of Christopher Blake repeated Maria and fell a step away from
him

Blake has been a deuced good friend to me insisted Will
thats what the old man hateswhat hes hated steadily all
along The whole trouble started when I wouldnt choose my
friends to please him and when at last I undertook to pick out
my own wife there was hell to pay

Marias gaze wandered inquiringly in the direction of the house
which had a disordered and thriftless air

Is she here she asked not without a slight nervousness in her
voice

Will followed her glance and taking off his big straw hat
pulled at the shoestring tied tightly around the crown

Not now but youll see her some day when shes dressed up and
I tell you shell be worth your looking at All she needs is a
little money to turn her into the most tearing beauty you ever
saw

And shes not at home

Not now he replied impatiently her mother has just come over
and taken her off I say Maria he lowered his voice and an
eager look came into his irresolute face which already showed
the effects of heavy drinking this cant keep up you know it
really cant We must have money for theres a child coming in
the autumn

A child exclaimed Maria startled Oh Will Will She
glanced round again at the barren landscape and the squalid
little house then something must be done at oncetheres no
time to lose Ill speak to grandfather about it this very
night

At least theres no harm in trying said Will catching
desperately at the suggestion Even if you dont make things
better theres a kind of comfort in the thought that you cant
make them worse Were at the bottom of the hill already So if
you dont pull us up at least you wont push us any farther
down

Oh Ill pull you up never fear but you must give me time

Your own affairs are in rather a muddle I reckon by now

Hopeless it seems but Ill share with you the few hundreds I
still have I brought this today thinking you might be in
immediate need

As she drew the little roll of bills from her pocket Will
reached out eagerly and seizing it from her counted it
greedily in her presence Well youre a downright brick
Maria he remarked as he thrust it hastily into his shirt

Disappointment had chilled Marias enthusiasm a little but the
next instant she dismissed the feeling as ungenerous and slipped
her hand affectionately through his arm as he walked back with
her into the road

I wish I could see Molly she said again her eyes on the
house where she caught a glimpse of a bright head withdrawn from
one of the windows

She is over at her mothers I told you returned Will
irritably and then stooping to kiss her hurriedly he added in
a persuasive voice Bring the old man to reason Maria its
life or death remember

Ill do my best Will Ill go on my knees to him tonight

Does he dislike you as much as ever

No he rather fancies me I think Last evening he grew almost
amiable and this morning Aunt Saidie told me he left me a pound
of fresh butter from the market jar If you only knew how fond
hes grown of his money you would realise what it means

Well keep it up for Gods sake Humour him for all hes worth
Coddle and coax him into doing something for us or dying and
leaving us his money

Marias face grew grave Thats the serious part Will he talks
of leaving every penny he has to foreign missions

The devil cried Will furiously If he does I hope hell land
in hell Dont let him Maria It all rests with you Why if he
did youd starve along with us wouldnt you

Oh you neednt think of meI could always teach you know and
a little money buys a great deal of happiness with me I have
learned that great wealth is almost as much of an evil as great
poverty

Id take the risk of it every time and he is beastly rich
isnt he Maria

One of the very richest men in the State they told me at the
crossroads

Yet he has the insolence to cut me off without a dollar Look at
this peteredout little farm hes given me Why it doesnt bring
in enough to feed a darkey

Well hope for better things dear but you must learn to be
patientvery patient His anger has been smothered so long that
it has grown almost as settled as hate Aunt Saidie doesnt dare
mention your name to him and she tells me that if I so much as
speak of you hell turn me out of doors

Then its even worse than I thought

Perhaps I cant say for I havent approached the subject even
remotely as yet Keep your courage however and I promise you to
do my best

She kissed him again and then turning her face homeward
started at a rapid walk down the lane The interview with Will
had disturbed her more than she liked to admit and it was with a
positive throb of pain that she forced herself at last to compare
the boy of five years ago with the broken and dispirited man from
whom she had just parted Was this tragedy the end of the young
ambition which Fletcher had nursed so fondly thisa nervous
overworked tobaccogrower with bloodshot eyes and features
already inflamed by reckless drinking The tears sprang to her
lashes and throwing up her hands with a pathetic gesture of
protest she hastened on homeward as if to escape the terror that
pursued her

She had turned from the lane into the main road and was just
approaching the great chestnuts which grew near the abandoned
icepond when looking up suddenly at the call of a bird above
her head she saw Christopher Blake standing beside the rail
fence and watching her with a strong and steady gaze
Involuntarily she slackened her pace and waited smiling for him
to cross the fence but to her amazement after an instant in
which his eyes held her as if rooted to the spot he turned
hastily away and walked rapidly in the opposite direction For a
breath she stood motionless gazing blankly into space then as
she went on again she knew that she carried with her not the
wonder at his sudden flight but the clear memory of that one
moments look into his eyes A century of experience with its
tears and its laughter its joy and its anguish its desire and
its fulfilment seemed crowded into the single instant that held
her immovable in the road



CHAPTER IV The Meeting in the Night

When Christopher turned so abruptly from Marias gaze he was
conscious only of a desperate impulse of flight At the instant
his strength seemed to fail him utterly and he realised that for
the first time in his life he feared to trust himself to face the
imminent moment His one thought was to escape quickly from her
presence and in the suddenness of his retreat he did not weigh
the possible effect upon her of his rudeness A little later
however when he had put the field between him and her haunting
eyes he found himself returning with remorse to his imaginings
of what her scattered impressions must have been

Between regret and perplexity the day dragged through and he met
his mothers exacting humours and Cynthias wistful inquiries
with a curious detachment of mind He had reached that middle
state of any powerful emotion when even the external objects
among which one moves seem affected by the inward struggle
between reason and desirethe field in which he worked the
distant landscape the familiar faces in the house and those
frail pathetic gestures of his mothers hands all expressed in
outward forms something of the passion which he felt stirring in
his own breast It was in his nature to dare risks blindlyto
hesitate at no experience offered him in his narrow life and
there were moments during this long day when he found himself
questioning if one might not after all plunge headlong into the
impossible

As he rose from the supper table where he had pushed his
untasted food impatiently away he remembered that he had
promised in the morning to meet Will Fletcher at the store and
lighting his lantern he started out to keep the appointment he
had almost forgotten He found Will overflowing with his domestic
troubles and it was after ten oclock before they both came out
upon the road and turned into opposite ways at the beginning of
Sol Peterkins lane

Ill help you with the ploughing of course Christopher said
as they lingered together a moment before parting make your
mind quite easy about that Ill be over at sunrise on Monday and
put in a whole days job

Then as he fell back into his own road he found something like
satisfaction in the prospect of driving Will Fletchers plough
The easy indifference with which he was accustomed to lend a hand
in a neighbours difficulty had always marked his association
with the man whose ruin he still assured himself he had
wrought

It was a dark moonless night with only a faint nebulous
whiteness where the clouded stars shone overhead His lantern
swinging lightly from his hand cast a shining yellow circle on
the ground before him and it was by this illumination that he
saw presently as he neared the sunken road into which he was
about to turn a portion of the shadow by the icepond detach
itself from the surrounding blackness and drift rapidly to meet
him In his first start of surprise he raised the lantern
quickly above his head and waited breathlessly while the
advancing shape assumed gradually a womans form The old ghost
stories of his childhood thronged confusedly into his brain and
then before the thrilling certainty of the figure before him he
uttered a single joyous exclamation

You

The light flashed full upon Marias face which gave back to him
a white and tired look Her eyes were heavy and there was a
strange solemnity about themsomething that appealed vaguely to
his religious instinct

What in heavens name has happened he asked and his voice
escaped his control and trembled with emotion

With a tired little laugh she screened her eyes from the
lantern

I had a talk with grandfather about Will she answered and he
got so angry that he locked me out of doors He had had a
worrying day in town and I think he hardly knew what he was
doingbut he has put up the bars and turned out the lights and
theres really no way of getting in

He thought for a moment Will you go on to your brothers or is
it too far

At first I started there but that must have been hours ago and
it was so dark I got lost by the icepond After all it would
only make matters worse if I saw Will again so the question is
Where am I to sleep

At Tom Spades thenor he hesitated an instant if you
care to come to us my sister will gladly find room for you

She shook her head No no you are very kind but I cant do
that It is best that I shouldnt leave the place perhaps and
when the servant comes over at sunrise I can slip up into my
room If youll lend me your lantern Ill make myself some kind
of a bed in the barn Fortunately grandfather forgot to lock the
door

In the barn he echoed surprised

Oh I went there first but after I lay down I suddenly
remembered the mice and got up and came away Im mortally afraid
of mice in the dark but your lantern will keep them off will it
not

She smiled at him from the shining circle which surrounded her
like a halo and for a moment he forgot her words in the
wonderful sense of her nearness Around them the night stretched
like a cloak enclosing them in an emotional intimacy which had
all the warmth of a caress As she leaned back against the body
of a tree and he drew forward that he might hold the lantern
above her head the situation was resolved in spite of the
effort that he made into the eternal problem of the man and the
woman He was aware that his blood worked rapidly in his veins
and as her glance reached upward from the light to meet his in
the shadow he realised with the swiftness of intuition that in
her also the appeal of the silence was faced with a struggle
They would ignore it he knew and yet it shone in their eyes
quivered in their voices and trembled in their divided hands
and to them both its presence was alive and evident in the space
between them He saw her bosom rise and fall her lips part
slightly and a tremor disturb the high serenity of her
selfcontrol and there came to him the memory of their first
meeting at the crossroads and of the mystery and the rapture of
his boyish love He had found her then the lady of his dreams
and now after all the violence of his revolt against her she
was still to him as he had first seen herthe woman whose soul
looked at him from her face

For a breathless momentfor a single heartbeatit seemed to
him that he had but to lean down and gather her eyes and lips and
hands to his embrace to feel her awaken to life within his arms
and her warm blood leap up beneath his mouth Then the madness
left him as suddenly as it had come and she grew strangely
white and distant and almost unreal in the spiritual beauty of
her look He caught his breath sharply and lowered his gaze to
the yellow circle that trembled on the ground

But you will be afraid even with the light he said in a voice
which had grown almost expressionless

As if awaking suddenly from sleep she passed her hand slowly
across her eyes

No I shall not be afraid with the light she answered and
moved out into the road

Then let me hold it for youthe hill is very rocky

She assented silently and quickened her steps down the long
incline then as she stumbled in the darkness he threw the
lantern over upon her side If you will lean on me I think I can
steady you he suggested waiting until she turned and laid her
hand upon his arm Thats better now go slowly and leave the
road to me How in thunder did you come over it in the pitch
dark

I fell several times she replied with a little unsteady
laugh and my feet are oh so hurt and bruised Tomorrow I shall
go on crutches

A bad nights work then

But not so bad as it might have been she added cheerfully

You mean if I had not found you it would have been worse Well
Im glad that much good has come out of it I have spared you a
coldso that goes down to my credit otherwiseBut what
difference does it make he finished impatiently We must have
met sooner or later even if I had run across the world instead of
merely across a tobacco field After all the world is no bigger
than a tobacco field when it comes to destiny

To destiny she looked up startled Then there are fatalists
even among tobaccogrowers

He met her question with a laugh But I wasnt always a tobacco
grower and there were poets before Homer who is about the only
one Ive ever read Its true Ive tried to lose the little
education I ever hadthat Ive done my best to come down to the
level of my own cattle but Im not an ox after all except in
strength and one has plenty of time to think when one works in
the field all day Why the fancies Ive had would positively
turn your head

Fanciesabout what

About life and death and the things one wants and can never get
I dream dreams and plot unimaginable evil

Not evil she protested

Whole crops of it and harvest them too

But why

For pure pleasurefor sheer beastly love of the devilment I
cant do

She shook her head treating his words as a jest

There was never evil that held its head so high

Thats pride you know

Nor that wore so frank a face

And thats hypocrisy

Nor that dared to be so rude

He caught up her laugh

You have me there I grant you What a brute I must have seemed
this morning

You were certainly not a Chesterfieldnor a Bolivar Blake

With a start he looked down upon her Then you too are aware
of the old chap he asked

Of Bolivar Blakewhy who isnt I used to be taught one of his
maxims as a childIf you cant tell a polite lie dont tell
any

Good manners but rather bad morality eh he inquired

Unfortunately the two things seem to run together she
replied which encourages me to hope that you will prove to be a
pattern of virtue

Dont hope too hard I may merely have lost the one trait
without developing the other

At least it does no harm to believe the best she returned in
the same careless tone Ahead of them where the great oaks were
massed darkly against the sky he saw the steep road splotched
into the surrounding blackness Her soft breathing came to him
from the obscurity at his side and he felt his arm burn beneath
the light pressure of her hand For the first time in his lonely
and isolated life he knew the quickened emotion the fulness of
experience which came to him with the touch of the woman whom
he still told himself he could never love Not to love her had
been so long for him a point of pride as well as of honour that
even while the wonderful glow pervaded his thoughts while his
pulses drummed madly in his temples he held himself doggedly to
the illusion that the appeal she made would vanish with the
morning It was a delirium of the senses he still reasoned and
knew even as the lie was spoken that the charm which drew him to
her was above all things the spirit speaking through the flesh

I fear I have been a great bother to you said Maria after a
moment but you will probably solace yourself with the
reflection that destiny would have prepared an equal nuisance had
you gone along another road

Perhaps he answered smiling but philosophy sometimes fails
a body doesnt it

It may be I knew a man once who said he leaned upon two
crutches philosophy and religion When one broke under him he
threw his whole weight on the otherand lo that gave way

Then he went down I suppose

I never heard the endbut if it wasnt quite so dark you would
find me really covered with confusion I have not only brought
you a good mile out of your road but I am now prepared to rob
you of your light Can you possibly find your way home in the
dark

As she looked up the lantern shone in his face and she saw that
he wore a whimsical smile

I have been in the dark all my life he answered until to
night

Until tonight

Until nowthis very minute For the first time for ten years I
begin to see my road at this instantto see where I have been
walking all along

And where did it lead you

He laughed at the seriousness in her voice

Through a muckheapin the steps of my own cattle I am sunk
over the neck in it already

Her tone caught the lightness of his and carried it off with
gaiety

But there is a way out Have you found it

There is none Ive wallowed so long in the filth that it has
covered me

Surely it will rub off she said

For a moment the lanterns flash rested upon his brow and eyes
relieving them against the obscurity which still enveloped his
mouth

The highbred lines of his profile stood out clear and fine as
those of an ivory carving and their very beauty saddened the
look she turned upon him Then the light fell suddenly lower and
revealed the coarsened jaw with the almost insolent strength of
the closed lips The whole effect was one of reckless power and
she caught her breath with the thought that so compelling a force
might serve equally the agencies of good or evil

They had reached the lawn and as he responded to her hurried
gesture of silence they passed the house quickly and entered the
great open door of the barn Here he hung the lantern from a
nail and then pulling down some straw from a pile in one
corner arranged it into the rude likeness of a pallet

I dont think the mice will trouble you he said at last as he
turned to go but if they dowhy just call out and Ill come
to slaughter

You wont go home then she asked amazed

He nodded carelessly

Not till daybreak Remember if you feel frightened that Im
within earshot

Then before she could protest or detain him for an explanation
he turned from her and went out into the darkness



CHAPTER V Maria Stands on Christophers Ground

A broad yellow beam sliding under the door brought Maria into
sudden consciousness and rising hastily from the straw where
her figure had shaped an almost perfect outline she crossed the
dusky floor smelling of trodden grain and went out into the early
sunshine which slanted over the gray fields A man trundling a
wheelbarrow from the market garden and a milkmaid crossing the
lawn with a bucket of fresh milk were the only moving figures in
the landscape and after a single hurried glance about her she
followed the straight road to the house and entered the rear
door which Malindy had unlocked

Meeting Fletcher a little later at breakfast she found to her
surprise that he accepted her presence without question and made
absolutely no allusion to the heated conversation of the evening
before He looked sullen and dirty as if he had slept all night
in his clothes and he responded to Marias few goodhumoured
remarks with a single abrupt nod over his coffeecup As she
watched him a feeling of pity for his loneliness moved her heart
and when he rose hastily at last and strode out into the hall she
followed him and spoke gently while he paused to take down his
hat from one of the old antlers near the door

If I could only be of some use to you grandfather she said
are you sure there is nothing I can do

With his hand still outstretched he hesitated an instant and
stood looking down upon her his heavy features wrinkling into a
grin

Ive nothing against you as a woman he responded but when
you set up and begin to charge like a judge Ill be hanged if I
can stand you

Then I wont charge any more I only want to help you and to do
what is best If you would but let me make myself of some
account

He laughed not unkindly and flecked with his stubby forefinger
at some crumbs which had lodged in the folds of his cravat

Then I reckon youd better mix a batch of dough and feed the
turkeys he replied and touching her shoulder with his hat
brim he went hurriedly out of doors

When he had disappeared beyond the last clump of shrubbery
bordering the drive she remembered the lantern she had left
hanging in the barn and going to look for it carried it
upstairs to her room In the afternoon however it occurred to
her that Christopher would probably need the light by evening
and swinging the handle over her arm she set out across the
newly ploughed fields toward the Blake cottage The stubborn
rustic pride which would keep him from returning to the Hall
aroused in her a frank almost tender amusement She had long ago
wearied of the trivial worldliness of life in the last few years
the shallowness of passion had seemed its crowning insult and
over the absolute sincerity of her own nature the primal emotion
she had heard in Christophers voice exerted a compelling charm
The makeshift of a conventional marriage had failed her utterly
her soul had rejected the womans usual cheap compromise with
externals and in her almost puritan scorn of the vanities by
which she was surrounded she had attained the moral elevation
which comes to those who live by an inner standard of purity
rather than by outward forms In the largeness of her nature
there had been small room for regret or for wasted passion and
until her meeting with Christopher on the day of her homecoming
he had existed in her imagination only as a bright and impossible
memory Now as she went rapidly forward along the little path
that edged the field she found herself wondering if after all
she had worn unconsciously his ideal as an armour against the
petty temptations and the sudden melancholies of the last six
years

As she neared the fence that divided the two farms she saw him
walking slowly along a newly turned furrow and when he looked up
she lifted the lantern and waved it in the air Quickening his
steps he swung himself over the rail fence with a single bound
and came to where she stood amid a dried fringe of last summers
yarrow

So you are none the worse for the night in the barn he asked
anxiously

Why I dreamed the most beautiful dreams she replied and I
had the most perfect sleep in the world

Then the mice kept away

At least they didnt wake me

I stayed within call until sunrise he said quietly You were
not afraid

Her rare smile shone suddenly upon him illumining the delicate
pallor of her face I knew that you were there she answered

For a moment he gazed steadily into her eyes then with a
decisive movement he took the lantern from her hand and turned as
though about to go back to his work

It was very kind of you to bring this over he said pausing
beside the fence

Kind Why what did you expect I knew it might hang there
forever but you would not come for it

No I should not have come for it he replied swinging the
lantern against the rails with such force that the glass
shattered and fell in pieces to the ground

Why what a shame said Maria and it is all my fault

A smile was on his face as he looked at her

You are rightit is all your fault he repeated while his
gaze dropped to the level of her lips and hung there for a
breathless instant

With an effort she broke the spell which had fallen over her
and turning from him pointed to the old Blake graveyard on the
little hill

Those black cedars have tempted me for days she said Will
you tell me what dust they guard so faithfully

He followed her gesture with a frown

I will show you if you like he answered It is the only spot
on earth where I may offer you hospitality

Your people are buried there

For two hundred years Will you come

While she hesitated he tossed the lantern over into his field
and came closer to her side Come he repeated gently and at
his voice a faint flush spread slowly from her throat to the
loosened hair upon her forehead The steady glow gave her face a
light a radiance that he had never seen there until today

Yes I will come if you wish it she responded quietly

Together they went slowly up the low brown incline over the
clods of upturned earth When they reached the brickedup wall
which had crumbled away in places he climbed over into the bed
of periwinkle and then held out his hands to assist her in
descending Here step into that hollow he said and dont
jump till I tell you Ah thats it now Im ready

At his words she made a sudden spring forward her dress caught
on the wall and she slipped lightly into his outstretched arms
For the half of a second he held her against his breast then as
she released herself he drew back and lifted his eves to meet
the serene composure of her expression He was conscious that his
own face flamed red hot but to all outward seeming she had not
noticed the incident which had so moved him The calm distinction
of her bearing struck him as forcibly as it had done at their
first meeting What a solemn place she said lowering her
voice as she looked about her

For answer he drew aside the screening boughs of a cedar and
motioned to the discoloured marble slabs strewn thickly under the
trees

Here are my people he returned gravely And here is my
ground

Pausing she glanced down on his fathers grave reading with
difficulty the inscription beneath the dry dust from the cedars

He lived to be very old she said after a moment

Seventy years He lived exactly ten years too long

Too long

Those last ten years wrecked him Had he died at sixty he would
have died happy

He turned from her throwing himself upon the carpet of
periwinkle and coming to where he lay she sat down on a granite
slab at his side

One must believe that there is a purpose in it she responded
raising a handful of fine dust and sifting it through her
fingers or one would go mad over the mystery of things

Well I dare say the purpose was to make me a tobaccogrower
he replied grimly and if so it has fulfilled itself in a
precious way Why theres never been a time since I was ten
years old when I wouldnt have changed places and said thank
you too with any one of those old fellows over there They
were jolly chaps I tell you and led jolly lives It used to be
said of them that they never won a penny nor missed a kiss

Nor learned a lesson evidently Well may they rest in peace
but Im not sure that their wisdom would carry far There are
better things than gaming and kissing when all is said

Better things Perhaps

Have you not found them

Not yet but then I cant judge anything except tobacco you
know

For a long pause she looked down into his upturned face

After all it isnt the way we live nor the work we do that
matters she said slowly but the ideal we put into it Is
there any work too sordid too prosaic to yield a return of
beauty

Do you think so he asked and glanced down the hill to his
ploughshare lying in the rippedup field But it is not beauty
that some of us want you seeits success action happiness
call it what you will

Surely they are not the same I have known many successful
people and the only three perfectly happy ones I ever met were
what the world calls failures

Failures he echoed and remembered Tucker

Her face softened and she looked beyond him to the blue sky
shining through the interlacing branches of bared trees

Two were women she pursued clasping and unclasping the quiet
hands in her lap and one was a Catholic priest who had been
reared in a foundling asylum and educated by charity When I knew
him he was on his way to a leper island in the South Seas where
he would be buried alive for the remainder of his life All he
had was an ideal but it flooded his soul with light Another was
a Russian Nihilist a girl in years and yet an atheist and a
revolutionist in thought and her unbelief was in its way as
beautiful as the religion of my priest To return to Russia meant
death she knew and yet she went back devoted and exalted to
lay down her life for an illusion So it seems when one looks
about the world that faith and doubt are dry and inanimate forms
until we pour forth our hearts blood which vivifies them

She fell silent and he started and touched softly the hem of her
black skirt

And the other he asked

The other had a stranger and a longer story but if you will
listen Ill tell it to you She was an Italian of a very old and
proud family and as she possessed rare loveliness and charm a
marriage was arranged for her with a wealthy nobleman who had
fallen in love with her before she left her convent She was a
rebellious soul it seems for the day before her wedding just
after she had patiently tried on her veil and orange blossoms
she slipped into the dress of her waitingmaid and ran off with a
musicteachera beggarly fanatic they told mea man of red
republican views who put dangerous ideas into the heads of the
peasantry From that moment they said her life was over her
family shut their doors upon her and she fell finally so low as
to be seen one evening singing in the public streets Her story
touched me when I heard it it seemed a pitiable thing that a
woman should be wrecked so hopelessly by a single moment of
mistaken courage and after months of searching I at last found
the place she lived in and went one May evening up the long
winding staircase to her apartmenttwo clean plain rooms which
looked on a little balcony where there were pots of sweet basil
and many pigeons At my knock the door opened and I knew her at
once in the beautiful white face and hands of the woman who stood
a little back in the shadow Her forty years had not coarsened
her as they do most Italian women and her eyes still held the
unshaken confidence of extreme youth Her husband was sleeping in
the next room she said he had but a few days more to live and
he had been steadily dying for a year Then at my gesture of
sympathy she shook her head and smiled

I have had twenty years she said and I have been perfectly
happy Think of that when so many women die without having even a
single day of life Why but for the one instant of courage that
saved me I myself might have known the world only as a vegetable
knows the garden in which it fattens My soul has lived and
though I have been hungry and cold and poorly clad I have never
sunk to the level of what they would have made me He is a
dreamer she finished gently and though his dreams were
nourished upon air and never came true except in our thoughts
still they have touched even the most common things with beauty
While she talked he awoke and called her and we went in to see
him He complained a little fretfully that his feet were cold
and she knelt down and warmed them in the shawl upon her bosom
The mark of death was on him and I doubt if even in the fulness
of his strength he were worthy of the passion he inspiredbut
that after all makes little difference It was a great love
which is the next best thing to a great faith

As she ended he raised his eyes slowly catching the fervour of
her glance

It was more than thatit was a great deliverance he said

Then as she rose he followed her from the graveyard and they
descended the low brown hill together



CHAPTER VI The Growing Light

By the end of the week a long rain had set in and while it
lasted Christopher took down the tobacco hanging in the roof of
the log barn and laid it in smooth piles pressed down by boards
on the ground The tobacco was still soft from the moist season
when Jim Weatherby who had sold his earlier in the year came
over to help pack the large casks for market bringing at the
same time a piece of news concerning Bill Fletcher

It seems Will met the old man somewhere on the road and they
came to downright blows he said Fletcher broke a hickory
stick over the boys shoulders

Christopher carefully sorted a pile of plants and then
selecting the finest six leaves wrapped them together by means
of a smaller one which he twisted tightly about the stems

Ah is that so he returned with a troubled look

Its a pretty kettle of fish sure enough pursued Jim Of
course Will has made a fool of himself and gone to the dogs and
all that but I must say it does seem a shame when you think
that old Fletcher cant take his money with him to the next
world As for pure stinginess I dont believe hed find his
match if he scoured the country Why they say his granddaughter
barely gets enough to eat Look here What are you putting in
that bad leaf for Its wormeaten all over

So it is admitted Christopher examining it with a laugh My
eyesight must be failing me But what good under heaven does his
money do Fletcher after all

Oh hes saving it up to leave to foreign missions Tom Spade
says Mr Carraway is coming down next week to draw up a new
will

And his grandchildren come in for nothing

It looks that waybut you cant see through Bill Fletcher so
nobody knows The funny part is that he has taken rather a liking
to Mrs Wyndham I hear and she has even persuaded him to raise
the wages of his hands Its a pity she cant patch up a peace
with Willthe quarrel seems to distress her very much

You have seen her then

Yesterday for a minute She stopped me near the store and asked
for news of Will There was nothing I could tell her except that
they dragged along somehow with Sol Peterkins help Thats a
fine woman Fletcher or no Fletcher

Well she cant help thatits merely a question of name
Theres Cynthia calling us to dinner Well have to fill the
hogsheads later on

But when the meal was over and he was returning to his work
Cynthia followed him with a message from his mother

She has asked for you all the morning Christopher theres
something on her mind though she seems quite herself and in a
very lively humour It is impossible to get her away from the
subject of marriageshe harps on it continually

He had turned to enter the house at her first words but now his
face clouded and he hung back before the door

Do you think Id better go in he asked hesitating

Theres no getting out of it without making her feel neglected
and perhaps your visit may divert her thoughts Im sure I dont
see what she has left to say on the subject

All right Ill go he said cheerfully but for heavens sake
help me drum up some fresh topics

Mrs Blake was sitting up in bed sipping a glass of port wine
and at Christophers step she turned her groping gaze helplessly
in his direction

What a heavy tramp you have my son you must be almost as large
as your father

Crossing the room as lightly as his rude boots permitted
Christopher stooped to kiss the cheek she held toward him The
old lady had wasted gradually to the shadow of herself and the
firelight from the hearth shone through the unearthly pallor of
her face and hands Her beautiful white hair was still arranged
over a high cushion in an elaborate fashion and her gown of
fine embroidered linen was pinned together with a delicate cameo
brooch

I have been talking very seriously to Lila she began at once
as he sat down by the bedside My age is great you know and it
is hardly probable that the good Lord will see fit to leave me
much longer to enjoy the pleasures of this world Now what
troubles me more than all else is that I am to die feeling that
the family will pass utterly away Is it possible that both Lila
and yourself persist in your absurd and selfish determination to
remain unmarried

Oh mother mother groaned Lila from the fireplace

You neednt interrupt me Lila you know quite well that a
family is looked at askance when all of its members remain
single Surely one old maidand I am quite reconciled to poor
Cynthias spinsterhoodis enough to leaven things as your
father used to say

Her memory slipped from her for a moment she caught at it
painfully and a peevish expression crossed her face

What was I saying Lila I grow so forgetful

About father dear

No no I remember nowit was about your marrying Well well
as I said before I fear your attitude is the result of some
sentimental fancies you have found in books My child there was
never a book yet that held a sensible view of love and I hope
you will pay no attention to what they say As for waiting until
you cant live without a man before you marry himtuttut the
only necessary question is to ascertain if you can possibly live
with him There is a great deal of sentiment talked in life my
dear and very little livedand my experience of the world has
shown me that one man is likely to make quite as good a husband
as anotherprovided he remains a gentleman and you dont expect
him to become a saint Ive had a long marriage my children and
a happy one Your father fell in love with me at his first
glance and he did not hate me at his last though the period
covered an association of thirty years We were an ideal couple
all things considered and he was a very devoted husband but to
this day I have not ceased to be thankful that he was never
placed in the position where he had to choose between me and his
dinner Honestly I may as well confess among us three it makes
me nervous when I think of the result of such a pass

Oh mother protested Lila reproachfully if I listened to you
I should never want to marry any man

Im sure I dont see why my dear I have always urged it as a
duty not advised it as a pleasure As far as that goes I hold
to this day the highest opinion of matrimony and of men though I
admit when I consider the attention they require I sometimes
feel that women might select a better object When the last word
is said a man is not half so satisfactory a domestic pet as a
cat and far less neat in his habits Your poor father would
throw his cigar ashes on the floor to the day of his death and I
could never persuade him to use an ashtray though I gave him
one regularly every Christmas that he lived Do you smoke cigars
Christopher I detect a strong odour of tobacco about you and I
hope you havent let Tucker persuade you into using anything so
vulgar as a pipe The worst effect of a war I am inclined to
believe is the excuse it offers every man who fought in it to
fall into bad habits

Oh its Uncle Tuckers pipe you smell replied Christopher
with a laugh as he rose from his chair I detest the stuff and
always did

I suppose I ought to be thankful for it said Mrs Blake
detaining him by a gesture but I cant help recalling a speech
of Micajah Blairs who said that a woman who didnt flirt and a
man who didnt smoke were unsexed creatures It is a commendable
eccentricity I suppose but an eccentricity good or bad is
equally to be deplored Your grandfather always said that the man
who was better than his neighbours was quite as unfortunate as
the man who was worse Who knows but that your dislike of tobacco
and your aversion to marriage may result from the same peculiar
quirk in your brain

Well its there and I cant alter it even to please you
mother declared Christopher from the door Ive set my face
square against them both and there it stands

He went out laughing and Mrs Blake resigned herself with a sigh
to her old port

The rain fell heavily whipping up foaming puddles in the muddy
road and beating down the old rosebushes in the yard

As Christopher paused for a moment in the doorway before going to
the barn he drew with delight the taste of the dampness into his
mouth and the odour of the moist earth into his nostrils The
world had taken on a new and appealing beauty and yet the
colourless landscape was touched with a sadness which he had
never seen in external things until today

His ears were now opened suddenly his eyes unbandaged and he
heard the rhythmical fall of the rain and saw the charm of the
brown fields with a vividness that he had never found in his
enjoyment of a summers day Human life also moved him to
responsive sympathy and he felt a great aching tenderness for
his blind mother and for his sisters with their narrowed and
empty lives His own share in the world he realised was but
that of a small insignificant failure he had been crushed down
like a weed in his tobacco field and for a new springingup he
found neither place nor purpose The facts of his own life were
not altered by so much as a shadow yet on the outside life that
was not his own he beheld a wonderful illumination

His powerful figure filled the doorway and Cynthia coming up
behind him raised herself on tiptoe to touch his bared head

Your hair is quite wet Christopher be sure to put on your hat
and fasten the oilcloth over your shoulders when you go back to
the barn You are so reckless that you make me uneasy Why the
rain has soaked entirely through your shirt

Oh Im a pine knot you neednt worry

She sighed impatiently and went back to the kitchen while his
gaze travelled slowly along the wet gray road to the abandoned
icepond and he thought of his meeting with Maria in the
darkness and of the light of the lantern shining on her face He
remembered her white hands against her black dress her fervent
eyes under the grave pallor of her brow her passionate kind
voice and her mouth with the faint smile which seemed never to
fade utterly away Love which is revealed usually as a pleasant
disturbing sentiment resulting from the ordinary purposes of
life had come to him in the form of a great regenerating force
destroying but that it might rebuild anew



CHAPTER VII In Which Carraway Speaks the Truth to Maria

During the first week in April Carraway appeared at the Hall in
answer to an urgent request from Fletcher that he should without
delay put the new will into proper form

On the morning after his arrival Carraway had a long
conversation with the old man in his sittingroom and when it
was over he came out with an anxious frown upon his brow and went
upstairs to the library which Maria had fitted up in the spare
room next her chamber It was the pleasantest spot in the house
he had concluded last evening and the impression returned to him
as he entered now and saw the light from the wood fire falling on
the shining floor which reflected the stately old furniture and
the cushions and the window curtains of faded green Books were
everywhere and he noticed at once that they were not the kind
read by the women whom he knewbig leather volumes on
philosophy yellowcovered French novels and curled edges of
what he took to be the classic poets It was almost with relief
that he noticed a dainty feminine touch here and therea work
bag of flowered silk upon the sofa a bowl of crocuses among the
papers on the old mahogany desk and clinging to each bit of
wellworn drapery in the room a faint and delicate fragrance

Maria was lying drowsily in a low chair before the fire and as
he entered she looked up with a smile and motioned to a
comfortable seat across the hearth A book was on her knees but
she had not been reading for her fingers were playing carelessly
with the uncut leaves Against her soft black dress the whiteness
of her face and hands showed almost too intense a contrast and
yet there was no hint of fragility in her appearance From head
to foot she was abounding with energy throbbing with life and
though Carraway would still perhaps have hesitated to call her
beautiful his eyes dwelt with pleasure on the noble lines of her
relaxed figure Better than beauty he admitted the moment
afterward was the charm that shone for him in her wonderfully
expressive facea face over which the experiences of many lives
seemed to ripple faintly in what was hardly more than the shadow
of a smile She had loved and suffered he thought with his gaze
upon her and from both love and suffering she had gained that
fulness of nature which is the greatest good that either has to
yield

So it is serious she said anxiously as he sat down

I fear soat least where your brother is concerned I cant
say just what the terms of the will are of course but he made
no secret at breakfast of his determination to leave half of his
propertywhich the result of recent investments has made very
largeto the cause of foreign missions

Yes he has told me about it

Then theres nothing more to be said unless you can persuade
him for your brothers sake to destroy the will when his anger
has blown over I used every argument I could think of but he
simply wouldnt listen to meswept my advice aside as if it was
so much wasted breath

He paused as Maria bent her ear attentively

He is coming upstairs now she exclaimed amazed

There was a heavy tread on the staircase and a little later
Fletcher came in and turned to close the door carefully behind
him He had recovered for a moment his air of bluff goodhumour
and his face crinkled into a ruddy smile

So youre hatching schemes between you I reckon he observed
and crossing to the hearth pushed back a log with the toe of
his heavy boot

It looks that way certainly replied Carraway with his
pleasant laugh But I must confess that I was doing nothing more
interesting than admiring Mrs Wyndhams taste in books

Fletcher glanced round indifferently

Well I havent any secrets he pursued still under the
pressure of the thought which had urged him upstairs and as far
as that goes I can tear up that piece of paper and have it done
with any day I please

So I had the honour to advise remarked Carraway

Thats neither here nor thar I reckonits made now and so
its likely to stand until I die though I dont doubt youll
twist and split it then as much as you can However I reckon the
foreign missions will look arter the part that goes to them and
if Marias got the sense I credit her with shell look arter
hers

After mine exclaimed Maria lifting her head to return his
gaze Why I thought you gave me my share when I married

So I didso I did and you let it slip like water through your
fingers but youve grown up I reckon sence you were such a
fool as to have your head turned by Wyndham and if you dont
hold on to this tighter than you did to the last you deserve to
lose it thats all Youre a good womanI aint lived a month
in the house with you and not found that outbut if you hadnt
had something more than goodness inside your head you wouldnt
have got so much as a cent out of me again Saidies a good woman
and a blamed fool too but youre different youve got a
backbone in your body and Ill be hanged if that aint why Im
leaving the Hall to you

The Hall echoed Maria rising impulsively from her chair and
facing him upon the hearthrug

The Hall and Saidie and the whole lot returned Fletcher
chuckling and I may as well tell you now that for all your
spendthrift notions about wages youre the only woman I ever saw
who was fit to own a foot of land But I like the quiet way you
manage things somehow and bless my soul if you were a man Id
leave you the whole business and let the missions hang

Theres time yet observed Carraway beneath his breath

No no its settled now returned Fletcher and shell have
more than she can handle as it is Most likely shell marry
again being a woman and a man will be master here arter all
If you do he added turning angrily upon his granddaughter
for heavens sakes dont let it be another precious scamp like
your first

With a shiver Maria caught her breath and bent toward him with an
appealing gesture of her arms

But you must not do it grandfather it isnt right The place
was never meant to belong to me

Well it belongs to me I reckon and confound your silly
puritanical fancies Ill leave it where I please retorted
Fletcher and strode from the room

Throwing herself back into her chair Maria lay for a time
looking thoughtfully at the hickory log which crumbled and threw
out a shower of red sparks Her face was grave but there was no
hint of indecision upon it and it struck Carraway very forcibly
at the instant that she knew her own mind quite clearly and
distinctly upon this as upon most other matters

It may surprise you she said presently speaking with sudden
passion but by right the Hall ought not to be mine and I do
not want it I have never loved it because it has never for a
moment seemed home to me and our people have always appeared
strangers upon the land How we came here I do not know but it
has not suited us and we have only disfigured a beauty into
which we did not fit Its very age is a reproach to us for it
shows off our newnessour lack of any past that we may call our
own Will might feel himself master here but I cannot

Carraway took off his glasses and rubbed patiently at the ridge
they had drawn across his nose

And yet why not he asked The place has been in your
grandfathers possession now for more than twenty years

For more than twenty years repeated Maria scornfully and
before that the Blakes lived herehow long

He met her question squarely For more than two hundred

Without shifting her steady gaze which she turned upon his face
she leaned forward clasping her hands loosely upon the knees

There are things that I want to know Mr Carraway she said
many things and I believe that you can tell me Most of all I
want to know why we ever came to Blake Hall Why the Blakes ever
left it And above all why they have hated us so heartily and
so long

She paused and sat motionless while she hung with suspended
breath upon his reply

For a moment the lawyer hesitated nervously twirling his glasses
between his thumb and forefinger then he slowly shook his head
and looked from her to the fire

Twenty years are not as a day despite your scorn my dear young
lady and many facts become overlaid with fiction in a shorter
time

But you know somethingand you believe still more

God forbid that I should convert you to any belief of mine

She put out a protesting hand her eyes still gravely insistent
Tell me allI demand it It is my right you must see that

A right to demolish sand housesto scatter old dust

A right to hear the truth Surely you will not withhold it from
me

I dont know the truth so I cant enlighten you I know only
the stories of both sides and they resemble each other merely in
that they both center about the same point of interest

Then you will tell them to meyou must she said earnestly
Tell me first word for word all that the Blakes believe of
us

With a laugh he put on his glasses that he might bring her
troubled face the more clearly before him

A high spirit of impartiality I admit he observed

That I should want to hear the other side

That being a woman you should take for granted the existence
of the other side

She shook her head impatiently You cant evade me by airing
camphorscented views of my sex she returned What I wish to
knowand I still stick to my point you seeis the very thing
you are so carefully holding back

I am holding back nothing on my honour he assured her If
you want the impression which still exists in the countyonly an
impressionI must make plain to you at the start for the events
happened when the State was in the throes of reconstruction when
each man was busy rebuilding his own fortunes and when tragedies
occurred without notice and were hushed up without remarkif
you want merely an impression I repeat then you may have it my
dear lady straight from the shoulder

Well her voice rose inquiringly for he had paused

There is really nothing definite known of the affair he
resumed after a moment even the papers which would have thrown
light into the darkness were destroyedburned it is said in an
old office which the Federal soldiers fired It is all mystery
grim mystery and surmise and when there is no chance of either
proving or disproving a case I dare say one mans word answers
quite as well as anothers At all events we have your
grandfathers testimony as chief actor and eyewitness against
the inherited convictions of our somewhat Homeric young
neighbour For eighteen years before the war Mr Fletcher was
sole agenta queer selection certainlyfor old Mr Blake who
was known to have grown very careless in the confidence he
placed When the crash came about three years after the war the
old gentlemans mind was much enfeebled and it was generally
rumoured that his children were kept in ignorance that the place
was passing from them until it was auctioned off over their heads
and Mr Fletcher became the purchaser How this was of course I
do not pretend to say but when the Hall finally went for the
absurd sum of seven thousand dollars life was at best a hard
struggle in the State and I imagine there was less surprise at
the sacrifice of the place than at the fact that your grandfather
should have been able to put down the ready money The making of
a fortune is always I suppose more inexplicable than the losing
of one The Blakes had always been accounted people of great
wealth and wastefulness but within five years from the close of
the war they had sunk to the position in which you find them now
a change I dare say from which it is natural much lingering
bitterness should result The old man died almost penniless and
his children were left to struggle on from day to day as best
they could It is a sad tale and I do not wonder that it moves
you he finished slowly and looked down to wipe his glasses

And grandfather asked the girl quietly Her gaze had not
wavered from his face but her eyes shone luminous through the
tears which filled them

He became rich as suddenly as the Blakes became poor Where his
money came from no one asked and no one cared except the Blakes
who were helpless They made some small attempts at law suits I
believe but Christopher was only a child then and there was
nobody with the spirit to push the case Then money was needed
and they were quite impoverished

Maria threw out her hands with a gesture of revolt

Oh it is a terrible story she said a terrible story

It is an old one and belongs to terrible times You have drawn
it from me for your own purpose and be that as it may I have
always believed in giving a straight answer to a straight
question Now such things would be impossible he added
cheerfully then I fear they were but too probable

In your heart you believe that it is true He did not flinch
from his response In my heart I believe that there is more in
it than a lie

Rising from her chair she turned from him and walked rapidly up
and down the room through the firelight which shimmered over the
polished floor Once she stopped by the window and drawing the
curtains aside looked out upon the April sunshine and upon the
young green leaves which tinted the distant woods Then coming
back to the hearthrug she stood gazing down upon him with a
serene and resolute expression

I am glad now that the Hall will be mine she said glad even
that it wasnt left to Will for who knows how he would have
looked at it There is but one thing to be done you must see
that yourself At grandfathers death the place must go back to
its rightful owners

To its rightful owners he repeated in amazement and rose to
his feet

To the Blakes Oh dont you see itcant you see that there is
nothing else to do in common honesty

He shook his head smiling

It is very beautiful my child but is it reasonable after
all he asked

Reasonable The fine scorn he had heard before in her voice
thrilled her from head to foot Shall I stop to ask what is
reasonable before doing what is right

Without looking at her he drew a handkerchief from his pocket
and shook it slowly out from its folds

Well Im not sure that you shouldnt he rejoined

Then I shant be reasonable Ill be wise she said for
surely if there is any wisdom upon earth it is simply to do
right It may be many years off and I may be an old woman but
when the Hall comes to me at grandfathers death I shall return
it to the Blakes

In the silence which followed he found himself looking into her
ardent face with a wonder not unmixed with awe To his rather
cynical view of the Fletchers such an outburst came as little
less than a veritable thunderclap and for the first time in his
life he felt a need to modify his conservative theories as to the
necessity of blue blood to nourish high ideals Maria indeed
seemed to him as she stood there drawn fine and strong against
the curtains of faded green to hold about her something better
than that aroma of the past which he had felt to be the intimate
charm of all exquisite things and it was at the moment the very
light and promise of the future which he saw in the broad
intelligence of her brow Was it possible after all he
questioned that out of the tragic wreck of old claims and old
customs which he had witnessed there should spring creatures of
even finer fiber than those who had gone before

So this is your last word he inquired helplessly

My last word to youyes In a moment I am going out to see the
Blakesto make them understand

He put out his hand as if to detain her by a feeble pull at her
skirt At least you will sleep a night upon your resolution

How can my sleeping alter things My waking may

And you will sweep the claims of twenty years aside in an hour

They are swept aside by the claims of two hundred

With a courteous gesture he bent over her hand and raised it
gravely to his lips

My dear young friend you are very lovely and very
unreasonable he said



CHAPTER VIII  Between Maria and Christopher

A little later Maria with a white scarf thrown over her head
came out of the Hall and passed swiftly along the road under the
young green leaves which were putting out on the trees When she
reached the whitewashed gate before the Blake cottage she saw
Christopher ploughing in the field on the left of the house and
turning into the little path which trailed through the tall weeds
beside the worm fence she crossed the yard and stood
hesitating at the beginning of the open furrow he had left behind
him His gaze was bent upon the horses and for a moment she
watched him in attentive silence her eyes dwelling on his
massive figure which cast a gigantic blueblack shadow across
the April sunbeams She saw him at the instant with a
distinctness a clearness of perception that she had never been
conscious of until today as if each trivial detail in his
appearance was magnified by the pale yellow sunshine through
which she looked upon it The abundant wheatenbrown hair waving
from the moist circle drawn by the hat he had thrown aside the
strong masculine profile burned to a faint terracotta shade from
wind and sun and the powerful hands knotted and roughened by
heavy labour all stood out vividly in the mental image which
remained with her when she lowered her eyes

Aroused by a sound from the house he looked up and saw her
standing on the edge of the ploughed field her lace scarf blown
softly in the April wind After a single minute of breathless
surprise he tossed the long ropes on the ground and leaving the
plough came rapidly across the loose clods of upturned earth

Did you come because I was thinking of you he asked simply
with the natural directness which had appealed so strongly to her
fearless nature

Were you thinking of me her faint smile shone on him for an
instant and were your thoughts as grave I wonder as my reason
for coming

So you have a reason then

Did you think I should dare to come without one

The light wind caught her scarf blowing the long ends about her
head From the frame of soft white lace her eyes looked dark and
solemn and very distant

I had hoped that you had no other reason than kindness He had
lost entirely the rustic restraint he had once felt in her
presence and as he stood there in his clothes of dull blue
jean it was easy to believe in the gallant generations at his
back Was the fret of their gay adventures in his blood she
wondered

You will see the kindness in my reason I hope she answered
quietly while the glow of her sudden resolution illumined her
face and at least you will admit the justicethough belated

He drew a step nearer And it concerns youand me he asked

It concerns youoh yes yes and me also though very
slightly I have just learnedjust a moment agowhat you must
have thought I knew all along

As he fell back she saw that he paled slowly beneath his sunburn

You have just learnedwhat he demanded

The truth she replied as much of the truth as one may learn
in an hour how it came that you are here and I am thereat the
Hall

At the Hall he repeated and there was relief in the quick
breath he drew I had forgotten the Hall

Forgotten it Why I thought it was your dream your longing
your one great memory

Smiling into her eyes he shook his head twice before he
answered

It was all thatonce

Then it is not so now she asked disappointed and what I
have to tell you will lose half its value

So it is about the Hall

With one hand she held back the fluttering lace upon her bosom
while lifting the other she pointed across the ploughed fields to
the old gray chimneys huddled amid the budding oaks

Does it not make you homesick to stand here and look at it she
asked Think For more than two hundred years your people lived
there and there is not a room within the house nor a spot upon
the land that does not hold some sacred association for those of
your name Startled by the passion in her words he turned from
the Hall at which he had been gazing

What do you mean  he demanded imperatively What do you wish
to say

Look at the Hall and not at me while I tell you It is thisnow
listen and do not turn from it for an instant Blake HallI have
just found it outwill come to me at grandfathers death and
when it doeswhen it does I shall return it to your familythe
whole of it every lovely acre Oh dont look at melook at the
Hall

But he looked neither at her nor at the Hall for his gaze
dropped to the ground and hung blankly upon a clod of dry brown
earth She saw him grow pale to the lips and dark blue circles
come out slowly about his eyes

It is but common justice you see that she urged

At this he raised his head and returned her look

And what of Will he asked

Her surprise showed in her face and at sight of it he repeated
his question with a stubborn insistence But what of Will What
has been done for Will

Oh I dont know I dont know The break is past mending But
it is not of him that I must speak to you nowit is of yourself
Dont you see that the terrible injustice has bowed me to the
earth What am I better than a dependenta charity ward who has
lived for years upon your money My very education my little
culture the refinements you see in methese even I have no real
right to for they belong to your family While you have worked
as a labourer in the field I have been busy squandering the
wealth which was not mine

His face grew gentle as he looked at her

If the Blake money has made you what you are then it has not
been utterly wasted he replied

Oh you dont understandyou dont understand she repeated
pressing her hands upon her bosom as if to quiet her fluttering
breath You have suffered from it all along but it is I who
suffer most todaywho suffer most because I am upon the side of
the injustice I can have no peace until you tell me that I may
still do my poor best to make amendsthat when your home is mine
you will let me give it back to you

It is too late he answered with bitter humour You cant put
a fieldhand in a fine house and make him a gentleman It is too
late to undo what was done twenty years ago The place can never
be mine againI have even ceased to want it Give it to Will

I couldnt if I wanted to she replied but I dont want toI
dont want to It must go back to you and to your sisters Do you
think I could ever be owner of it now Even if it comes to me
when I am an old woman I shall always feel myself a stranger in
the house though I should live there day and night for fifty
years No no it is impossible that I should ever keep it for an
instant It must go back to you and to the Blakes who come after
you

There will be no Blakes after me he answered I am the last

Then promise me that if the Hall is ever mine you will take it

From you No not unless I took it to hand on to your brother
It is an old score that you have brought upone that lasted
twenty years before it was settled It is too late to stir up
matters now

It is not too late she said earnestly It is never too late
to try to undo a wrong

The wrong was not yours it must never touch you he replied
If my life was as clean as yours it would perhaps not be too
late for me either Ten years ago I might have felt differently
about it but not now

He broke off hurriedly and Maria with a hopeless gesture
turned back into the path

Then I shall appeal to your sisters when the time comes she
responded quietly

Catching the loose ends of her scarf he drew her slowly around
until she met his eyes And I have said nothing to youto you
he began in a constrained voice which he tried in vain to
steady because it is so hard to say anything and not say too
much This at least you must knowthat I am your servant now
and shall be all my life

She smiled sadly looking down at the scarf which was crushed in
his hands

And yet you will not grant the wish of my heart she said

How could I Put me back in the Hall and I should be as
ignorant and as coarse as I am out here A labourer is all I am
and all I am fit to be I once had a rather bookish ambition you
know but that is overI wanted to read Greek and translate The
Iliad and all thatand yet today I doubt if I could write a
decent letter to save my soul Its partly my fault of course
but you cant know you could never knowthe abject bitterness
and despair of those years when I tried to sink myself to the
level of the brutestried to forget that I was any better than
the oxen I drove No theres no pulling me up again such things
arent lived over and Im down for good

Her tears which she had held back broke forth at his words and
he saw them fall upon her bosom where her hands were still
tightly clasped

And it is all our fault she said brokenly

Not yours surely

It is not too late she went on passionately laying her hand
upon his arm and looking up at him with a misty brightness Oh
if you would let me make amendslet me help you

Is there any help he asked with his eyes on the hand upon his
arm

If you will let me I will find it We will take up your study
where you broke it offwe will come up step by step even to
Homer if you like I am fond of books you know and I have had
my fancy for Greek too Oh it will be so easyso easy and
when the time comes for you to go back to the Hall I shall have
made you the most learned Blake of the whole line

He bent quickly and kissed the hand which trembled on his sleeve

Make of me what you please he said I am at your service

For the second time he saw the wonderful lightthe fervour
illumine her face and then fade slowly leaving a still soft
radiance of expression

Then I may teach you all that you havent learned she said
with a happy little laugh How fortunate that I should have been
born a bookworm Shall we begin with Greek

He smiled No lets start with Englishand start low

Then well do both but where shall it be Not at the Hall

Hardly Theres a bench though down by the poplar spring that
looks as if it were meant to be in school Do you know the place
Its in my pasture by the meadow brook

I can find it and Ill bring the books tomorrow at this hour
Will you come

Tomorrowand every day

Every day

For an instant he looked at her in perplexity I may as well
tell you he said at last that Im one of the very biggest
rascals on Gods earth Im not worth all this you know thats
honest

And so are you she called back gaily as she turned from him
and went rapidly along the little path



CHAPTER IX Christopher Faces Himself

When she had gone through the gate and across the little patch of
trodden grass into the sunken road Christopher took up the ropes
and with a quick jerk of the buried ploughshare began his
plodding walk over the turnedup sod The furrow was short but
when he reached the end of it he paused from sheer exhaustion and
stood wiping the heavy moisture from his brow The scene through
which he had just passed had left him quivering in every nerve
as if he had been engaged in some terrible struggle against
physical odds All at once he became aware that the afternoon was
too oppressive for field work and unhitching the horses from
the plough he led them slowly back to the stable beyond the
house As he went it seemed to him that he had grown middleaged
within the hour his youth had departed as mysteriously as his
strength

A little later Tucker who was sitting on the end of a big log
at the woodpile looked up in surprise from the anthill he was
watching

Quit work early eh Christopher

Yes Ive given out replied Christopher stopping beside him
and picking up the axe which lay in a scattered pile of chips
Its the spring weather I reckon but Im not fit for a tougher
job than chopping wood

Well Id leave that off just now if I were you

Raising the axe Christopher swung it lightly over his shoulder
then lowering it with a nerveless movement he tossed it
impatiently on the ground

A queer thing happened just now Uncle Tucker he said a
thing youll hardly believe even when I tell you I had a visit
from Mrs Wyndham and she came to say he stammered and broke
off abruptly

Mrs Wyndham repeated Tucker Shes Bill Fletchers
granddaughter isnt she

Maria Fletcheryou may have seen her when she lived here five
or six years ago

Tucker shook his head

Bless your heart my boy I havent seen a woman except Lucy and
the girls for twentyfive years But why did she come I wonder

Thats the strange part and you wont understand it until you
see her She came because she had just heardsome one had told
herabout Fletchers old rascality

You dont say so exclaimed Tucker beneath his breath He gave
a long whistle and sat smiling at the little red anthill And
did she actually proffer an apology he inquired

An amendment rather The Hall will come to her at Fletchers
death and she walked over to say quite coolly that she wanted to
give it back to us Think of that To part with such a home for
the sake of mere right and justice

It is something to think about assented Tucker and to think
hard about tooand yet I cut my teeth on the theory that women
have no sense of honour Now that is pure foolish straitlaced
honour and nothing else

Nothing else repeated Christopher softly and if youll
believe it she criedshe really cried when I told her I
couldnt take it Oh shes wonderful he burst out suddenly
all his awkward reserve dropping from him You cant be with her
ten minutes without feeling how good she isgood all through
with a big goodness that isnt in the least like the little
prudishness of other women

He checked himself hastily but not before Tucker had glanced up
with his pleasant smile

Well my boy I dont misunderstand you I never knew a man yet
to begin a love affair with a panegyric on virtue Shes an
estimable woman I dare say and I presume shes plain

Plain gasped Christopher Why shes beautifulat least you
think so when you see her smile

So she smiled through her tears eh

Christopher started angrily Can you sit there on that log and
laugh at such a thing he demanded

Come come protested Tucker an honest laugh never turned a
sweet deed sour since the world beganand that was more than
sweet it was fine Id like to know that woman Christopher

You could never know herno man could Shes all clear and
bright on the surface but all mystery beneath

Ah thats it you see there was never a fascinating woman yet
who was easy to understand Wasnt it that shrewd old gallant
Bolivar Blake who said that in love an ounce of mystery was
worth a pound of morality

Its like him he said a lot of nonsense commented
Christopher But to think he added after a moment that she
should be Bill Fletchers granddaughter

Well I knew her mother returned Tucker and she was as
honest Godfearing a body as ever trod this earth She stood out
against Fletcher to the last you know and worked hard for her
living while that scamp her husband drank them both to death
There are some people who are born with a downright genius for
honesty and this girl may be one of them

I dont knowI dont know said Christopher in a voice which
had grown spiritless Then after an instant in which he stared
blankly down at Tuckers anthill he turned hurriedly away and
followed the little straggling path to the barn door

From the restlessness that pricked in his limbs there was no
escape and after entering the barn he came out again and went
down into the pasture to the long bench beside the poplar spring
Here while the faint shadows of the young leaves played over
him he sat with his head bent forward and his hands dropped
listlessly between his knees

Around him there was the tender green of the spring meadows
divided by a little brook where the willows shone pure silver
under the April wind Near at hand a catbird sang in short
tripping notes and in the clump of briars by the spring a rabbit
sat alert for the first sound So motionless was Christopher that
he seemed sitting there by the pale gray body of a poplar
almost to become a part of the tree against which he leanedto
lose for the time at least his share in the moving animal life
around him

At first there was mere blankness in his mindan absence of
light and colour in which his thoughts were suddenly blotted out
then as the wind raised the hair upon his brow he lifted his
eyes from the ground and with the movement it seemed as if his
life ran backward to its beginning and he saw himself not as he
was today but as he might have been in a period of time which
had no being

Before him were his knotted and blistered hands his long limbs
outstretched in their coarse clothes but in the vision beyond
the little spring he walked proudly with his rightful heritage
upon hima Blake by force of blood and circumstance The world
lay before himbright alluring a thing of enchanting promise
and it was as if he looked for the first time upon the
possibilities contained in this life upon the earth For an
instant the glow lastedthe beauty dwelt upon the vision and he
beheld clear and radiant the happiness which might have been
his own then it grew dark again and he faced the brutal truth
in all its nakedness he knew himself for what he wasa man
debased by ignorance and passion to the level of the beasts He
had sold his birthright for a requital which had sickened him
even in the moment of fulfilment

To do him justice now that the time had come for an
acknowledgment he felt no temptation to evade the judgment of his
own mind nor to cheat himself with the belief that the boy was
marked for ruin before he saw himthat Will had worked out in
vicious weakness his own end It was not the weakness after
all that he had played uponit was rather the excitable passion
and the whimpering fears of the hereditary drunkard He
remembered now the long days that he had given to his revenge
the nights when he had tossed sleepless while he planned a
widening of the breach with Fletcher That at least was his
work and his alonethe bitter hatred more cruel than death
with which the two now stood apart and snarled It was a human
life that he had taken in his handhe saw that now in his first
moment of awakeninga life that he had destroyed as deliberately
as if he had struck it dead before him Day by day step by step
silent unswerving devilish he had kept about his purpose and
now at the last he had only to sit still and watch his triumph

With a sob he bowed his head in his clasped hands and so shut
out the light



CHAPTER X By the Poplar Spring

The next day he watched for her anxiously until she appeared over
the low brow of the hill her arms filled with books and Agag
trotting at her side As she descended slowly into the broad
ravine where he awaited her under six great poplars that
surrounded the little spring he saw that she wore a dress of
some soft creamy stuff and a large white hat that shaded her
brow and eyes She looked younger he noticed than she had done
in her black gown and he recalled while she neared him the
afternoon more than six years before when she had come suddenly
upon him while he worked in his tobacco

So you are present at the rollcall she said laughing as she
sat down on the bench beside him and spread out the books that
she had brought

Why Ive been sitting here for half an hour he answered

What a shamethats a whole furrow unploughed isnt it

Several of them but Im not counting furrows now Im getting
ready to appall you by my ignorance He spoke with a determined
reckless gaiety that lent a peculiar animation to his face

If you are waiting for that you are going to be disappointed
she replied smiling for Ive put my heart into the work and I
was born and patterned for a teacher I always knew it Were
going to do English literature and a first book in Latin

Are we He picked up the Latin grammar and ran his fingers
lightly through the pages I went a little way in this once he
said I got as far as omnia vincit amor and stopped Tobacco
conquered me instead

She caught up his gay laugh Well well try it over again she
returned and held out the book

An hour later when the first lesson was over and he had gone
back to his work he carried with him a wonderful exhilarationa
feeling as if he had with a sudden effort burst the bonds that
had held him to the earth By the next day the elation vanished
and a great heaviness came in its place but for a single
afternoon he had known what it was to thrill in every fiber with
a powerful and pure emotionan emotion beside which all the
cheap sensations of his life showed stale and colourless While
the strangeness of this mood was still upon him he chanced upon
Lila and Jim Weatherby standing together by the gate in the gray
dusk and when presently the girl came back alone across the yard
he laid his hand upon her arm and drew her over to Tuckers bench
beside the rosebush

Lila Ive changed my mind about it all he said

About what dear

About Jim and you We were all wrongall of us except Uncle
Tuckerwrong from the very start You musnt mind mother you
musnt mind anybody Marry Jim and be happy if he can make you
so

Oh Christopher gasped Lila with a long breath lifting her
lovely pensive face Oh Christopher

Dont wait dont put it off dont listen to any of us he
urged impatiently Good God If you love him as you say you do
why have you let all these years slip away

But you thought it was best Christopher You told me so

Best Theres nothing best except to be happy if you get the
chance

He wants me to marry him now said Lila lowering her voice
Mother will never know he thinks her mind grows so feeble he
wants me to marry him without any getting readyafter church one
Sunday morning

Putting his arm about her Christopher held her for a moment
against his side Then do it he said gravely as he stooped
and kissed her

And several weeks later on a bright first Sunday in May Lila
was married after morning services in the little country
church and Christopher watched her almost eagerly as she walked
home across the broad meadows powdered white with daisies To the
reproachful countenance which Cynthia presented to him upon his
return to the house he gave back a careless and defiant smile

So its all over he announced gaily and Lilas married at
last

Then youre satisfied I hope rejoined Cynthia grimly now
that youve dragged us down to the level of the Weatherbys and
the Fletchers Theres nothing more to be said about it I
suppose and you may as well come in to dinner

She held herself stiffly aloof from the subject with her head
flung back and her chin expressing an indignant protest There
was a kind of rebellious scorn in the way in which she carved the
shoulder of bacon and poured the coffee

Good Lord Its such a little thing to make a fuss about said
Tucker when you remember my dear that our levels arent any
bigger than chalk lines in the eyes of God Almighty

Cynthia regarded him with squinting displeasure

Oh of course you have no family pride she returned but I
had thought there was a little left in Christopher

Christopher shook his head smiling indifferently Not enough to
want blood sacrifices he responded and fell into a detached
and thoughtful silence The vision of Lila in her radiant
happiness remained with him like a picture that one has beheld by
some rare chance in a vivid and lovely light and it was still
before him when he left the house presently and strolled slowly
down to meet Maria by the poplar spring

The bloom of the meadows filled his nostrils with a delicate
fragrance and from the bough of an old appletree in the orchard
he heard the low afternoon murmurs of a solitary thrush May was
on the earth and it had entered into him as into the piping
birds and the spreading trees It was at last good to be alive
to breathe the warm sweet air and to watch the sunshine
slanting on the low green hill So closely akin were his moods
to those of the changing seasons that at the instant he seemed
to feel the current of his being flow from the earth beneath his
feetas if his physical nature drew strength and nourishment
from that genial and abundant source

When he reached the spring he saw Maria appear on the brow of the
hill and with a quick joyous bound his heart leaped up to meet
her As she came toward him her white dress swept the tall grass
from her feet and her shadow flew like a winged creature
straight before her There was a vivid softness in her facea
look at once bright and wistfulwhich moved him with a new and
strange tenderness

I was a little late she explained as they met before the long
bench and she laid her books upon it and I am very warm May I
have a drink

From a bramble cup

How else She took off her hat and tossed it on the grass at
her feet then going to the spring she waited while he plucked
a leaf from the bramble and bent it into shape When he filled it
and held it out she placed her lips to the edge of the leaf and
looked up at him with smiling eyes while she drank slowly from
his hand

It holds only a drop but how delicious she said seating
herself again upon the bench and leaning back against the great
body of a poplar Then her eyes fell upon his clothes Why how
very much dressed you look she added

Oh theres a reason besides SundayIve just come from a
wedding Lila has married after twelve years of waiting

Your pretty sister And to whom

To Jim Weatherbyold Jacobs son you know Now dont tell me
that you disapprove I count on your good sense to see the wisdom
of it

So it is your pretty sister she said slowly the woman I
passed in the road the other day and held my breath as I did
before Botticellis Venus

Is that so Well she doesnt know much about pictures nor does
Jim She has thrown herself away Cynthia says but what could
she have waited for after all Nothing had ever come to her and
she had lived thirty years Besides she will be very happy and
thats a good deal isnt it

Its everything said Maria quietly looking down into her lap

Everything And if you had been born in her place

I am not in her place and never could be but six years ago if
I had been told that I must live here all my life I think I
should have fretted myself to death that would have happened six
years ago for I was born with a great aching for life and I
thought then that one could live only in the big outside world

And now he questioned for she paused and sat smiling gravely
at the book she held

Now I know that the fulness of life does not come from the
things outside of us and that we ourselves must create the
beauty in which we live Oh I have learned so much from misery
she went on softly and worst of all I have learned what it is
to starve for bread in the midst of sugarplums

And it was worth learning

The knowledge that I gained Oh yes yes for it taught me how
to be happy I went down into hell she said passionately and
I came outclean I saw evil such as I had never heard of I
went close to it I even touched it but I always kept my soul
very far away and I was like a person in a dream The more I saw
of sin and ugliness the more I dreamed of peace and beauty I
builded me my own refuge I fed on my own strength day and night
and I am what I am

The loveliest woman on Gods earth he said

You do not know me she answered and opened the book before
her It was the story of the Holy Grail she added and we
left off here Oh those brave days of King Arthur It was always
May then

He touched the page lightly with a long blade of grass

Read yourselfthis once he pleaded and let me listen

Leaning a little forward she looked down and slowly turned the
pages her head bent over the book her long lashes shading the
faint flush in her cheeks Over her white dress fell a delicate
lacework from the young poplar leaves flecked here and there
with pale drops of sunshine which filtered through the thickly
clustered boughs When the wind passed in the high treetops the
shadows soft and fine as cobweb rippled over her dress and a
loose strand of her dark hair waved gently about her ear The
lifethe throbbing vitality withinher seemed to vivify the
very air she breathed and he felt all at once that the glad
thrill which stirred his blood was but a response to the fervent
spirit which spoke in her voice

For it giveth unto all lovers courage that lusty month of May
she read in something to constrain him to some manner of thing
more in that month than in any other monthfor then all herbs
and trees renew a man and woman and in likewise lovers call
again to mind old gentleness and old service and many kind deeds
that were forgotten by negligence

The words went like wine to his head and he saw her shadowy
figure recede and dissolve suddenly as in a mist A lump rose in
his throat his heart leaped and he felt his pulses beating
madly in his temples He drew back closing his eves to shut out
her face but the next instant as she stirred slightly to hold
down the rippling leaves he bent forward and laid his hand upon
the one that held the open book

Her voice fluttered into silence and raising her head she
looked up in tremulous surprise He saw her face pale slowly her
lids quiver and droop above her shining eyes and her teeth gleam
milk white between her parted lips A tremor of alarm ran through
her and she made a swift movement to escape then lifting her
eyes again she looked full into his own and stooping quickly
he kissed her on the mouth

An instant afterward the book fell to the ground and he rose to
his feet and stood trembling against the body of the poplar

Forgive me he said forgive meI have ruined it

Standing beside the bench she watched him with a still grave
gentleness before which his gaze dropped slowly to the ground

Yes you have ruined this she answered smiling but Latin is
still left

Its no use he went on breathlessly I cant do it its no
use

His eyes sought hers and held them while he made a single step
forward then turning quickly away he went from her across the
meadow to the distant wood



BOOK FIVE The Ancient Law


CHAPTER I Christopher Seeks an Escape

A clump of brambles caught at his feet and stumbling like a
drunken man he threw himself at full length upon the ground
pressing his forehead on the young green thorns A century
seemed to have passed since his flight from the poplar spring
and yet the soft afternoon sunshine was still about him and the
low murmurs of the thrush still floated from the old appletree
All the violence of his undisciplined nature had rushed into
revolt against the surrender which he felt must come and he was
conscious at the instant that he hated only a little less
supremely than he loved In the end the greater passion would
triumph over him he knew but as he lay there face downward upon
the earth the last evil instincts of his revenge battled against
the remorse which had driven him from Marias presence He saw
himself clearly for what he was he had learned at last to call
his sin by its right name and yet he felt that somewhere in the
depths of his being he had not ceased to love the evil that he
had done He hated Fletcher he told himself as righteously as
ever but between himself and the face of his enemy a veil had
fallenthe old wrong no longer stood out in a blaze of light A
womans smile divided him like a drawn sword from his brutal
past and he had lost the reckless courage with which he once
might have flung himself upon destruction

Rising presently he crossed the meadow and went slowly back to
his work in the stables keeping his thoughts with an effort upon
his accustomed tasks A great weariness for the endless daily
round of shall things was upon him and he felt all at once that
the emotion struggling within his heart must burst forth at last
and pervade the visible world He was conscious of an impulse to
sing to laugh to talk in broken sentences to himself and any
utterance however slight and meaningless seemed to relieve in a
measure the nervous tension of his thoughts

In one instant there entered into him a desperate determination
to play the traitorto desert his post and strike out boldly and
alone into the world And with the next breath he saw himself
living to old age as he had lived from boyhoodwithin reach of
Marias hand meeting her fervent eyes and yet separated from
her by a distance greater than God or man could bridge With the
thought of her he saw again her faint smile which lingered always
about her mouth and his blood stirred at the memory of the kiss
which she had neither resisted nor returned

Cynthia searching for him a few minutes later found him leaning
idly against the mares stall looking down upon a halffinished
nest which a housewren had begun to build upon his currycomb

Its a pity to disturb that Tucker would say he observed
motioning toward the few wisps of straw on the ledge

Oh she can start it somewhere else replied Cynthia
indifferently They have sent for you from the store
Christopherits something about one of the servants I believe
Theyre always getting into trouble and wanting you to pull them
out The descendants of the old Blake slaves were still spoken
of by Cynthia as the servants though they had been free men
and women for almost thirty years

Christopher started from his abstraction and turned toward her
with a gesture of annoyance

Well Ill have to go down I suppose he said Has mother
asked for me today

Only for Jim againits always Jim now I declare I believe we
might all move away and shed never know the difference so long
as he was left She forgets us entirely sometimes and fancies
that father is alive again

Its a good thing Jim amuses her at any rate

An expression of anger drew Cynthias brows together Oh I dare
say but it does seem hard that she should have grown to dislike
me after all Ive done for her There are times when she wont
let me even come in the roomwhen shes not herself you know

Her words were swallowed in a sob and he stood staring at her in
an amazement too sudden to be mixed with pity

And you have given up your whole life to her he exclaimed
appalled by the injustice of the god of sacrifice

Cynthia put up one knotted hand and stroked back the thin hair
upon her temples It was all I had to give she answered and
went out into the yard

He let her go from him without replying and before her pathetic
figure had reached the house she was blotted entirely from his
thoughts for it was a part of the tragedy of her unselfishness
that she had never existed as a distinct personality even in the
minds of those who knew and loved her

When presently he passed through the yard on his way to the
store he saw her taking in the dried clothes from the old
lilacbushes and called back carelessly that he would be home to
supper Then forgetting her lesser miseries in his own greater
one he fell into his troubled brooding as he swung rapidly along
the road

At the store the usual group of loungers welcomed him and among
them he saw to his surprise the cheerful face of Jim Weatherby a
little clouded by the important news he was evidently seeking to
hold back

I tried to keep them from sending for you Christopher the
young man explained It is no business of yoursthat is what I
said

Well it seems that every thriftless nigger in the county thinks
hes got a claim upon you sho enough put in Tom Spade It
warnt mon last week that I had a letter from the grandson of
yo pas old blacksmith Buck sayin he was to hang in
Philadelphia for somebodys murder an that I must tell Marse
Christopher to come an git him off Thars a good six hunnard of
em black an yaller an its God Amighty or Marse Christopher
to em every one

What is it now asked Christopher a little wearily taking off
his hat and running his hand through his thick fair hair If
anybodys been stealing chickens theyve got to take the
consequences

Oh its not chicken stealin this time its a blamed sight
worse They want you to send somebody over to Uncle Isamsyou
remember his little cabin five miles off in Alorses woodsto
help him bury his children who have died of smallpox There are
four of em dead it seems an the rest are all down with the
disease Thars not a morsel of food in the house an not a
livin nigger will go nigh em

Uncle Isam repeated Christopher as if trying to recall the
name Why I havent laid eyes upon the man for years

Very likely but hes sent you a message by a boy who was
gathering pine knots at the foot of his hill He was to tell
Marse Christopher that he had had nothing to eat for two whole
days an his children were unburied Then the boy got scared an
scampered off an that was all

Christophers laugh sounded rather brutal

So he used to belong to us did he he inquired

He was yo pas own coachman I recollect him plain as day
answered Tom I warnt mon a child then an he used to flick
his whip at my bare legs whenever he passed me in the road

Well what is to be done asked Christopher turning suddenly
upon him

The Lord He knows suh Thars not a nigger as will go nigh him
an Im not blamin em not I Jims filled his cart with food
an hes goin to dump the things out at the foot of the hill
then maybe Uncle Isam can crawl down an drag em back His
wifes down with it too they say She was workin here not mon
six months ago but she left her place of a sudden an went back
again

Christopher glanced carelessly at the little cart waiting in the
road and then throwing off his coat tossed it on the seat

Ill trouble you to lend me your overalls Tom he said and
you can send a boy up to the house and get mine in exchange Put
what medicines you have in the cart Ill take them over to the
old fool

Good Lord said Tom and mechanically got out of his blue jean
clothes

Now dont be a downright ass Christopher put in Jim
Weatherby Youve got your mother on your hands you know and
what under heaven have you to do with Uncle Isam I knew some
foolishness would most likely come of it if they sent up for
you

Oh he used to belong to us you see explained Christopher
carelessly

And hes been an ungrateful thriftless free Negro for nearly
thirty years

Thats just itfor not quite thirty years Look here if youll
drive me over in the cart and leave the things at the foot of the
hill Ill be obliged to you Ill probably have to stay out a
couple of weeksuntil theres no danger of my bringing back the
diseaseso Ill wear Toms overalls and leave my clothes
somewhere in the woods Oh Ill take care of course Im no
fool

Youre surer of that than I am returned Jim thinking of Lila
I cant help feeling that theres some truth in fathers saying
that a man cant be a hero without being a bit of a fool as well
For Gods sake dont Christopher You have no right

No I have no right repeated Christopher as he got into the
cart and took up the hanging reins A sudden animation had leaped
into his face and his eyes were shining It was the old love of a
risk for the sake of the risk which to Tucker had always seemed
to lack the moral elements of true courage and the careless
gaiety with which he spoke robbed the situation of its underlying
somber horror

Jim swung himself angrily upon the seat and touched the horse
lightly with the whip And theres your mother sitting at
homeand Cynthiaand Lila he said

Christopher turned on him a face in whose expression he found a
mystery that he could not solve

I cant help it Jim to save my life I cant he answered It
isnt anything heroic you know that as well as I I dont care a
straw for Uncle Isam and his children but if I didnt go up
there and bury those dead darkies Id never have a moments
peace Ive been everything but a skulking coward and I cant
turn out to be that at the end Its the way Im made

Well I dare say were made different responded Jim rather
dryly for it was his wedding day and he was going farther from
his bride But for my part I cant help thinking of that poor
blind old lady and how helpless they all are Yes were made
different I reckon thats what it means

The cart jogged on slowly through the fading sunshine and when
at last it came to the foot of the hill where Uncle Isam lived
Christopher got out and shouldered a bag of meal

Youll run the place I know and look after mother while Im
away he said

Oh I suppose Ill have to returned Jim and then his ill
humour vanished and he smiled and held out his hand Goodby
old man God bless you he said heartily

Sitting there in the road he watched Christopher pass out of
sight under the green leaves stooping slightly beneath the bag
of meal and whistling a merry scrap of an old song At the
instant it came to Jim with the force of a blow that this was the
first cheerful sound he had heard from him for weeks and still
pondering he turned the horses head and drove slowly home to
his own happiness



CHAPTER II The Measure of Maria

When two weeks later Christopher reached home again he was met
by Tuckers gentle banter and Lilas look of passionate reproach

Oh dear you might have died breathed the girl with a
shudder

Christopher laughed

So might Uncle Tucker when he went into the war was his
retort He was a little thinner a little graver and the sunburn
upon his face had faded to a paler shade After the short absence
his powerful figure struck them as almost gigantic physically
he had never appeared more impressive than he did standing there
in the sunlight that filled the kitchen doorway

But that was different protested Lila flushing and this
thiswhy you hardly knew Uncle Isam when you passed him in the
road

And half the time forgot to speak to him added Tucker
laughing His eyes were on the young mans figure and they grew
a little wistful as they always did in the presence of perfect
masculine strength Well Im glad your search for adventures
didnt end in disaster he added pleasantly

To Christophers surprise Cynthia was the single member of the
family who showed a sympathy with his reckless knight errantry
There was nothing else for you to do of course she said in a
resolute voice lifting her worn face where the lines had
deepened in his absence he used to be fathers coachman before
the war

She had gone from the kitchen as she spoke and Christopher
following her threw an anxious glance along the little platform
to the closed door of the house

And mother Cynthia he asked quickly

Her mind still wanders but at times she seems to come back to
herself for a little while and only this morning she awoke from
a nap and asked for you quite clearly We told her you had gone
hunting

May I see her now Who is with her

Jim He has been so good

The admission was wrung shortly from her rigid honesty and there
was no visible softening of her grim reserve when entering the
house with Christopher she found herself presently beside Jim
Weatherby who was chatting merrily in Mrs Blakes room

The old lady shrivelled and faded as the dried goldenrod which
filled the great jars on the hearth lay half hidden among the
pillows in her high white bed her vacant eyes fixed upon the
sunshine which fell through the little window At Christophers
step her memory flickered back for an instant and the change
showed in the sudden animation of her glance

I was dreaming of your father my son and you have his voice

I am like him in other ways I hope mother

If I could only see you Christopherit is so hard to remember
You had golden curls and wore a white pinafore I trimmed it with
the embroidery from my last set of petticoats And your hands
were dimpled all over you would suck your thumb there was no
breaking you though I wrapped it in a rag soaked in quinine

That was almost thirty years ago mother broke in Cynthia
catching her breath sharply He is a man now and bigoh so
bigand his hair has grown a little darker

I know Cynthia I know returned Mrs Blake with a peevish
movement of her thin hand but you wont let me remember I am
trying to remember She fell to whimpering like a hurt child
and then growing suddenly quiet reached out until she touched
Christophers head Youre a man I know she said older than
your father was when his first child was born There have been
two crosses in my life Christophermy blindness and my never
having heard the voices of my grandchildren playing in the house
Such a roomy old house too with so much space for them to fill
with cheerful noise I always liked noise you know it tells of
life and never disturbs me so long as it is pleasant What I
hate is the empty silence that reminds one of the grave

She was quite herself now and bending over he kissed the hand
upon the counterpane

Oh mother mother if I could only have made you happy

And you couldnt Christopher

I couldnt marry dear I couldnt

There was no one you meanno woman whom you could have loved
and who would have given you children Surely there are still
good and gentle women left in the world

There was none for me

She sighed hopelessly

You have nevernever had a low fancy Christopher

Never mother

Thank God it is one thing I could not forgive A gentleman may
have his follies your father used to say but he must never
stoop for them Let him keep to his own level even in his
indiscretions Ah your father had his faults my son but he
never forgot for one instant in his life that he was born a
gentleman He was a good husband too a good husband and I was
married to him for nearly forty years The greatest trial of my
marriage was that he would throw his cigar ashes on the floor
Women think so much of little things you know and Ive always
felt that I should have been a happier woman if he had learned to
use an ashtray But he never wouldhe never would though I
gave him one every Christmas for almost forty years

Falling silent her hands played fitfully upon the counterpane
and when next she spoke the present had slipped from her and her
thoughts had gone back to her early triumphs

She wandered aimlessly and waveringly on in a feeble vacancy and
Christopher after watching her for an agonised moment left the
room and went out into the fresh air of the yard He could always
escape by flight from the slow deathbed it was Cynthia who
faced hourly the final tragedy of a long and happy life

The thought of Will had oppressed him like a nightmare for the
last two weeks and it was almost unconsciously that he tuned now
in the direction of the store and passed presently into the
shaded lane leading to Sol Peterkins His mood was heavy upon
him and so deep was the abstraction in which he walked that it
was only when he heard his name called softly from a little
distance that he looked up to find Maria Fletcher approaching him
over the pale gray shadows in the road Her eyes were luminous
and she stretched her hand toward him in a happy gesture

Oh if you only knew how wonderful I think you she cried
impulsively

He held her hand an instant and then letting it fall withdrew
his gaze slowly from her exalted look The pure heights of her
fervour were beyond the reach of his more earthly level and as
he turned from her some old words of her own were respoken in his
ears Faith and doubt are mere empty forms until we pour out the
hearts blood that vivifies them It was her hearts blood that
she had put into her dreams and it was this he told himself
that gave her mystic visions their illusive appearance of
reality Beauty enveloped her as an atmosphere it softened her
sternest sacrifice it coloured her barest outlook it
transformed daily the common road in which she walked and hourly
it sustained and nourished her as it nourished poor crippled
Tucker on his old pine bench The eye of the spirit was
theirsthis Christopher had learned at last and he had learned
also that for him there still remained only the weak blurred
vision of the flesh

You make me feel the veriest hypocrite he said at the end of
the long pause

She shook her head And that you are surely not

So you still believe in me

Its not beliefI KNOW in you

Well dont praise me dont admire me dont pretend for Gods
sake that Im anything better than the brute you see

I dont pretend anything better she protested and when you
talk like this it only makes me feel the more keenly your
wonderful courage

I havent any he burst out almost angrily Not an atom do
you hear Whatever I may appear on top at bottom I am a great
skulking coward and nothing more Why I couldnt even stay and
take my punishment the other day I sneaked off like a hound

Your punishment she faltered and he saw her lashes tremble

For the other dayfor the afternoon by the poplar spring Ive
been wanting to beg your pardon on my knees

Her lashes were raised steadily and she regarded him gravely
while a slight frown gathered her dark brows She was still
humanly feminine enough to find the apology harder to forgive
than the offense

Oh I had forgotten she said a little coldly So that was
after all why you ran away

It was not the only reason

And the other

He closed his eyes suddenly and drew back

I ran away because I knew if I stayed I should do it again
within two seconds he replied

A little blue flower was growing in the red clay wheelrut at her
feet and stooping she caressed it gently without plucking it

It was very foolish she said in a quiet voice but I had
forgotten it and you should have let it rest Afterward you did
such a brave splendid thing

I did nothing but run from you he persisted losing his head
If I hadnt gone to Uncle Isam Id have done something equally
reckless in a different way I wanted to get away from youto
escape you but I couldntI couldnt You were with me always
night and day in those Godforsaken woods I never lost you for
one instant never I tried to but I couldnt

You couldnt she repeated and rising faced him calmly Then
before the look in his eyes her own wavered and fell slowly to
the ground and he saw her quiver and grow white as if a rough
wind blew over her With an effort he steadied himself and turned
away

There is but one thing to do he said holding his breath in
the pause its a long story but if you will listen
patientlyand it is very longI will tell you all Following
him she crossed the carpet of pine needles and sat down upon the
end of a fallen log

Tell me nothing that you do not care to she answered and sat
waiting

It began long ago when we were both little children he went
on and then going back from her into the lane he stood staring
down upon the little blue flower blooming in the wheelrut She
saw his shadow stretching across the road blurred into the pale
dusk of the wood uncertain somber gigantic in its outline His
hat was lying on the ground at her feet and lifting it she ran
her fingers idly along the brim

For a time the silence lasted then coming back to her he sat
down on the log and dropped his clasped hands between his knees
She heard his heavy breathing and something in the sound drew
her toward him with a sympathetic movement

Ah dont tell me dont tell me she entreated

You must listen patiently he returned without looking at her
and not interruptabove all not interrupt

She bent her head I will not speak a word nor move a finger
until the end she promised and leaning a little forward with
his eyes on the ground and his hands hanging listlessly between
his knees he began his story

The air was so still that his voice sounded strangely harsh in
the silence but presently she heard the soughing of the pine
trees far up above and while it lasted it deadened the jarring
discord of the human tones She sat quite motionless upon the
log not lifting a finger nor speaking a word as she had
promised and her gaze was fixed steadily upon a bit of dried
fern growing between the roots of a dead tree

It went on so for five years he slowly finished and it was
from beginning to end deliberate devilish revenge I meant from
the first to make him what he is today I meant to make him hate
his grandfather as he doesI meant to make him the hopeless
drunkard that he is It is all my workevery bit of itas you
see it now

He paused but her eyes clung to the withered fern and so quiet
was her figure that it seemed as if she had not drawn breath
since he began Her faint smile was still sketched about the
corners of her mouth and her fingers were closed upon the brim
of his harvest hat

For five years I was like that he went on again I did not
know I did not careI wanted to be a beast Then you came and
it was different

For the first time she turned and looked at him

And it was different she repeated beneath her breath

Oh theres nothing to say that will make things better I know
that If you had not come I should never have known myself nor
what I had been It was like a thunderclapthe whole thing it
shook me off my feet before I saw what it meantbefore I would
acknowledge even to myself that

That she questioned in a whisper for he had bitten back the
words

That I love you

As he spoke she slipped suddenly to her knees and lay with her
face hidden on the old log while her smothered sobs ran in long
shudders through her body A murmur reached him presently and it
seemed to him that she was praying softly in her clasped hands
but when in a new horror of himself he made a movement to rise
and slip away she looked up and gently touched him detainingly
on the arm

Oh how unhappyhow unhappy you have been she said

It is not that I mind he answered If I could take all the
misery of it I shouldnt care but I have made you suffer and
for the sin that is mine alone

For a moment she was silent breathing quickly between parted
lips then turning with an impulsive gesture she laid her cheek
upon the hand hanging at his side

Not yours alone she said softly for it has become mine
too

Before the wonder of her words he stared at her with dazed eyes
while their meaning shook him slowly to his senses

Maria he called out sharply in the voice of one who speaks
from a distance

She met his appeal with a swift outward movement of her arms
and bending over laid her hands gently upon his head

Mine too Christophermine too she repeated for I take
the blame of it and I will share in the atonement My dear my
dear is love so slight a thing that it would share the joy and
leave the sorrowthat it would take the good and reject the
evil Why it is all mine All All What you have been I was
also what I am today you will be I have been yours since the
first instant you looked upon me

With a sob he caught her hands and crushed them in his own

Then this is love Maria

It has been lovealways

From the firstas with me

As with you Beloved there is not a wrong on this earth that
could come between us now for there is no room in my heart where
it might enter There can be no sin against love which love does
not acknowledge

Falling apart their hands dropped before them and they stood
looking at each other in a silence that went deeper than words
She felt his gaze enveloping her in warmth from head to foot but
he still made no movement to draw nearer for there are moments
when the touch of the flesh grows meaningless before the mute
appeal of the spirit In that one speechless instant there passed
between them the pledges and the explanations of years

Suddenly the light flamed in his face and opening his arms he
made a single step toward her but melting into tears she turned
from him and ran out into the road



CHAPTER III Wills Ruin

Blinded by tears she went swiftly back along the road into the
shadows which thickened beyond the first short bend Will must be
saved at any cost by any sacrifice she told herself with
passionate insistence He must be saved though she gave up her
whole life to the work of his redemption though she must stand
daily and hourly guard against his weakness He must be saved
not for his own sake alone but because it was the one way in
which she might work out Christophers salvation As she went on
scheme after scheme beckoned and repelled her plan after plan
was caught at only to be rejected and it was at last with a
sinking heart though still full of high resolves that she
turned from the lane into a strip of corduroy road and so came
quickly to the barren little farm adjoining Sol Peterkins

Will was sitting idly on an overturned wheelbarrow beside the
woodpile and as she approached him she assumed with an effort a
face of cheerful courage

Oh Will I thought youd gone to work You promised me

Well I havent and theres an end of it he returned
irritably chewing hard on a chip he had picked up from the
ground and whats more I shant go till I see the use Its
killing me by inches I tell you Im not strong enough to stand a
life like this Drudge drudge drudge theres nothing else
except the little spirit I get from drink

And that ruins you Oh dont dont Ill go on my knees to
you Ill work for you like a servant day and night Ill sell my
very clothes to help you if youll only promise me never to
drink again

You a servant said Will and laughed shortly while he looked
her over with raised eyebrows Why your stockings would keep me
in cigarettes for a week

A flush crossed Marias face and she glanced down guiltily
letting her black skirt fall above the lace upon her petticoat
I have bought nothing since coming home she responded
presently with quiet dignity these belong with my old
luxuries to a past life There were a great many of them and it
will fortunately take me a long time to wear them out

Oh I dont begrudge them returned Will a little ashamed of
his show of temper fine clothes suit you and I hope you will
squeeze them out of grandpa all you can Its as good a way for
him to spend his money as any other and it doesnt hurt me so
long as hell never let me see the colour of a cent

But your promise dear Will you promise me

He lifted his sullen face toward her kind eyes then turning
away kicked listlessly at the rotting chips

Whats the use in promising I wouldnt keep it he replied
Why there are times when but for whisky Id go mad Its the
life I tell you thats killing me not drink If things were
different I shouldnt crave itI shouldnt miss it even Why
for three months after I married Molly I didnt touch a single
drop and Id have kept it up too except for grandpas
devilment Its his fault he drove me back to it as clear as
day

His weak mouth quivered and he sucked in his breath in the way
he had inherited from Fletcher The deep flush across his face
faded slowly and dropping his restless bloodshot eyes he dug
his foot into the mould with spasmodic twitches of his body His
clothes appeared to have been flung upon him and his cravat and
loosened collar betrayed the lack of neatness which had always
repelled Maria so strongly in her grandfather As she watched him
she wondered with a pang that she had never noticed until today
the resemblance he bore to the old man at the Hall

But one must be patient Will she said helplessly after a
moments thought theres always hope of a mendingand as far
as that goes grandfather may relent tomorrow

Relent Pshaw Id like to see him do it this side of hell Let
him die thats all I ask of him His room is a long sight better
than his company and you may tell him I said so

What good would come of that

I dont want any good to come of it Why should I Hes brought
me to this pass with his own hand

But surely it was partly your fault He loved you once

Nonsense He wanted a dog to badger that was all Christopher
Blake said so

Christopher Blake Oh Will Will if you could only
understand

She turned hopelessly away from him and looked with despairing
eyes over the ploughed fields which blushed faintly in the
sunshine

So your spring ploughing is all done she said at last
desisting from her attempt to soften his sullen obduracy and
you have been working harder than I knew

Oh its not I returned Will promptly his face clearing for
the first time Its all Christophers work he ploughed that
field just before he went away Do you see that new cover over
the well He knocked that up the last morning he was here and
made those steps before the front door at the same time Now
hes the kind of friend worth having and no mistake But for him
Id have landed in the poorhouse long ago

Marias gaze left the field and returned to Wills face where it
lingered wistfully

Have you ever heard what it was all about Will she asked
the old trouble between him and grandfather

Some silly property right I believe I cant remember Did you
ever see anybody yet with whom grandpa was on decent terms

He used to be with you Will

Only so long as I wore short breeches and he could whack me over
the head whenever he had a mind to I tell you Id rather try to
get along with Beelzebub himself

Have you ever tried peacemaking in earnest I wonder

Twirling a chip between his thumb and forefinger he flirted it
angrily at a solitary hen scratching in the mould

Why shortly after my marriage I went over there and positively
wiped up the floor with myself I offered him everything under
heaven in the shape of good behaviour and by Jove I meant it
too Id have stopped drinking then Id even have given up
Christopher Blake

Did you tell him that

Did I ever tell a thunderstorm Id run indoors It was enough to
get away with a whole skinhe left me little more And the day
afterward by the way he sent me the deeds to this rotten farm
and warned me that hed shoot me down if I ever set foot at the
Hall

And there has been no softeningno wavering since

Will shook his head with a brutal laugh Oh you heard of our
meeting in the road and what came of it I told him I was
starving he answered that he wasnt responsible for all the
worthless paupers in the county Then I cursed him and he broke
his stick on my shoulders I say Maria he wound up
desperately do you think hell live forever

She kept her eyes upon him without answering fearing to tell him
that by the terms of the new will he could never come into his
share of Fletchers wealth

Has he ever seen Molly she asked suddenly while an
unreasonable hope shot through her heart Does he know about the
child

He may have seen herI dont know but shes not so much to
look at now shes gone all to pieces under this awful worry It
isnt my fault God knows but she expected different things when
she married me She thought wed live somewhere in the city and
that shed have pretty clothes to wear

I was thinking that when the child came he might forgive you
broke in Maria almost cheerfully

And in the meantime were to die like rats Oh theres no use
talking its got to end one way or another Theres not a cent
in the house nor a decent scrap of food and Molly is having to
see the doctor every day I declare its enough to drive me
clean to desperation

And what good would that do Molly or yourself Be a man Will
and dont let a woman hear you whine Now Im going in to see
her and Ill stay to help her about supper

She nodded brightly and opening the little door of the house
passed into the single lower room which served as kitchen and
diningroom in one Beyond the disorderly table from which the
remains of dinner had not yet been cleared away Molly was lying
on a hard wooden lounge covered with strips of faded calico Her
abundant flaxen hair hung in lusterless masses upon her
shoulders and the soiled cotton wrapper she wore was torn open
at the throat as if she had clutched it in a passion of childish
petulance At Marias entrance she started and looked up angrily
from her dejected attitude

I cant see any visitorsIm not fit she cried

Marie drew forward a broken splitbottomed chair and sat down
beside the lounge

Im not a visitor Molly she answered and Ive come to see
if I cant make you a little easier Wont you let me fix you
comfortably Why you poor child your hands are as hot as fire

Im hot all over returned Molly peevishly and Im sickIm
as sick as I can be Will wont believe it but the doctor says
so

Will does believe it and it worries him terribly Here sit up
and let me bathe your face and hands in cold water Doesnt that
feel better

A little admitted Molly when Maria had found a towel and
dried her hands

And now Im going to comb the tangles out of your hair What
lovely hair It is the colour of ripe corn

A pleased flush brightened Mollys face and she resigned herself
easily to Marias willing services Theres a comb over there on
that shelf under the mirror she said Will broke half the
teeth out of it the other day and it pulls my hair out when I
use it

Then Ill bring you one of mine You must be careful of these
curls Theyre too pretty to treat roughly Do I hurt you

As she spoke a bright strand of the girls hair twisted about
one of her rings and after hesitating an instant she drew the
circle from her finger and laid it in Mollys lap

There I havent any money so thats to buy you medicine and
food she said It cost a good deal once I fancy

Diamonds gasped Molly with a cry of rapture

Her hand closed over the ring with a frantic clutch then
slipping it on she lay watching the stone sparkle in the last
sunbeams A colour had bloomed suddenly in her face and her eyes
shone with a light as brilliant as that of the jewel at which she
gazed

And you hadothers she asked in a kind of sacred awe

A great many oncea necklace and rings and brooches and a
silly tiara that made me look a fright I never cared for them
after the novelty of owning them wore off They are evil things
it seems to me and should never be the gifts of love for each
one of those foolish stones stands for greed and pride and
selfishness and maybe crime That was my way of looking at them
of course and whenever I wore my necklace I used to feel like
asking pardon of every beggar that I passed One link in this
chain might make a man of you was what I wanted to saybut I
never did Well they are almost all gone now some I sold and
some I gave away This one will buy you medicine I hope and
then it will give me more happiness than it has ever done
before

Oh it is beautiful beautiful sighed Molly beneath her
breath and then went to the little cracked mirror in the corner
and held the diamond first to her ear and then against her hair
They suit me she said at last opening the bosom of her
wrapper and trying it on her pretty throat they would make me
look so splendid Oh if Id only had a lover who could give me
things like this

Maria watching her felt her heart contract suddenly with a pang
of remembrance Jewels had been the one thing which Jack Wyndham
had given her for of the finer gifts of the spirit he had been
beggared long before she knew him In the first months of his
infatuation he had showered her with diamonds and she had grown
presently to see a winking mockery in each bauble that he tossed
her Before the first year was ended she had felt her pride
broken by the oppressiveness of the jewels that bedecked her
body like the mystic princess who was killed at last by the
material weight of the golden crown upon her brow

They could never make you happy Molly How could they Come
back and lie down and let me put the ring away Perhaps Id
better take it to town myself But Molly would not open her
closed hand on which the diamond shone and long after Maria had
cooked supper and gone back to the Hall the girl lay motionless
holding the ring against the light When Will came in from
milking she showed it to him with a burst of joy

Look Oh look Isnt it like the sun

He eyed it critically

By Jove It must have cost cool hundreds Ill take it to town
tomorrow and bring back the things you need It will get the
baby clothes too so you wont have to bother about the sewing

You shant You shant cried Molly in a passion of sobs Its
mine She gave it to me and you shant take it away I dont
want the medicine it never does me any good and I can make the
baby clothes out of my old things Ill never never give it up

For an instant Will stared at her as if she had lost her senses

Well she was a fool to let you get it he said as he flung
himself out of the room



CHAPTER IV In Which Mrs Blakes Eyes are Opened

Before the beauty of Marias high magnanimity Christopher had
felt himself thrust further into the abasement of his
selfcontempt Had she met his confession with reproach with
righteous aversion with the horror he had half expected it is
possible that his heart might have recoiled into a last
expression of defiance But there had been none of these things
In his memory her face shone moonlike from its cloud of dark
hair and he saw upon it only the look of a great and sorrowful
passion His wretchedness had drawn her closer not put her
further away and he had felt the quiet of her tolerance not less
gratefully than he had felt the fervour of her love Her
forgiveness had been of the grandeur of her own nature and its
height and breadth had appealed even apart from her emotion to
a mind that was accustomed to dwell daily on long reaches of
unbroken space He had been bred on large things from his
birthlarge horizons large stretches of field and sky large
impulses and large powers of hating and he found now that a
womans presence filled to overflowing the empty vastness of his
moods

Reaching the yard he saw Tucker sitting placidly on his bench
and crossing the long grass he flung himself down beside him
with a sigh of pleasure in the beauty of the scene

Youre right Uncle Tucker its all wonderful I never saw such
a sunset in my life

Ah but you havent seen it yet said Tucker Ive been
looking at it since it first caught that pile of clouds and it
grows more splendid every instant Im not an overreligious body
I reckon and Ive always held that the best compliment you can
pay God Almighty is to let Him go His own gait and quit advising
Him but I declare as I sat here just now I couldnt help being
impertinent enough to pray that I might live to see another

Well its a firstrate one thats so It seems to shake a body
out of the muck somehow

I shouldnt wonder if it did and thats what I told two young
fools who were up here just now asking me to patch up their first
married quarrel For heavens sake stop playing with mud and
sit down and watch that sunset I said to em and if youll
believe it the girl actually dropped her jaws and replied she
had to hurry back to shell her beans while the light lasted
Beans Why theyll make beans enough of their marriage and so I
told em

Tapping his crutch gently on the ground he paused and sat
smiling broadly at the sunset

For a time Christopher watched with him while the gold
andcrimson glory flamed beyond the twisted boughs of the old
pine then turning his troubled face on Tuckers cheerful one
he asked deliberately

Do you sometimes regret that you never married Uncle Tucker

Regret repeated Tucker softly Why no I havent time for
ittheres too much else to think about Regret is a dangerous
thing my boy you let a little one no bigger than a mustard seed
into your heart and before you know it youve hatched out a
whole brood Why if I began to regret that heaven knows where I
should stop Id regret my leg and arm next the pictures I might
have painted and the four years war which we might have won
No no Id change nothing I tell younot a day not an hour
not a single sin nor a single virtue Theyre all woven into the
pattern of the whole and I reckon the Lord knew the figure He
had in mind

Well Id like to pull a thread or two out of it returned
Christopher moodily squinting his eyes at the approaching form
of Susan Spade who came from the afterglow through the
whitewashed gate Why whats bringing her I wonder he asked
with evident displeasure

To this inquiry Susan herself presently made answer as she walked
with her determined tread across the little yard

Ive a bit of news for you Mr Christopher an I reckon youd
ruther have it from my mouth than from Bill Fletchers His
backs up agin the Lord knows why an hes gone an moved his
pasture fence so as to take in yo old field that lies beside it
He swars its his too but Toms ready to match him with a
bigger oath that its yours an always has been

Of course its mine said Christopher coolly The meadow brook
marks the boundary and the field is on this side I can prove it
by Tom or Jacob Weatherby tomorrow

Well hes took it  rejoined Mrs Spade flatly

He wont keep it long I reckon maam said Tucker in his
pleasant manner and I must say it seems to me that Bill
Fletcher is straining at a gnat Why he has near two thousand
acres hasnt he And what under heaven does he want with that
old field the sheep have nibbled bare Theres no sense in it

It aint sense its nature returned Mrs Spade sitting
squarely down on the bench from which Christopher had risen an
thats what Ive had agin men folks from the startthars too
much natur in em You kin skeer it out of a woman an you kin
beat it out of a dog an tharre times when you kin even spank
it out of a baby but if you oust it from a man thar aint
nothin but skin an bones left behind An naturs a ticklish
thing to handle without gloves bless yo soul suh Its like a
hive of bees you give it a little poke to start it an the
first thing you know its swarmin all over both yo hands Its
a skeery thing suh an Bill Fletchers got his share of it
shos youre born

It has its way with him pretty thoroughly I think responded
Tucker chuckling but if I were you Christopher Id stick up
for my rights in that old field Bill Fletcher may need exercise
but theres no reason he should get it by trampling over you

Oh Ill throw his fence down never fear answered Christopher
indifferently He knew it I dare say when he put it up

Its a fuss he wants suh an nothing else declared Mrs
Spade smoothing down the starched fold of her gingham apron
an if he doesnt git it po creetur hes goin to be laid up
in bed befo the week is out Hes bilin hot inside I can see
that in his face an if the steam dont work out one way it will
another When a man aint got a wife or child to nag at hes
mighty sho to turn right round an begin naggin at his
neighbours an thats why its the bounden duty of every decent
woman to marry an save the peace Why if Tom hadnt had me to
worry on I reckon hed be the biggest blusterer in this county
or the next

Leaving her still talking Christopher went from her into the
house where he lingered an instant with drawn breath before his
mothers door The old lady was sleeping tranquilly and
treading softly in his heavy boots he passed out to the friendly
faces of the horses and the cool dusk of the stable

As the days went on drawing gradually toward summer Mrs
Blakes life began peacefully to flicker out like a candle that
has burned into the socket There were hours when her mind was
quite clear and at such times she would talk unceasingly in her
old sprightly fashion with her animated gestures and her arch
and fascinating smile But following these sanguine periods there
would come whole days when she lay unconscious and barely taking
breath while her features grew sharp and wan under the pallid
skin

It was when she had just passed through one of these states that
Lila came out on a Sunday afternoon to find Christopher at the
woodpile and told him with a burst of tears that she thought
the end had come

Shes quite herself and wants us all she said sobbing And
shes even asked for the house servants every onefor Phyllis
and Tobias and so many of them who have been away for years
Its just as if she knew that she was dying and wanted to say
goodby

Throwing the axe hurriedly aside Christopher followed her into
the house and then entering the old ladys room stopped short
beside the threshold in a grief that was not unmixed with wonder

The sunshine fell straight through the window on the high white
pillows and among them Mrs Blake was sitting rigidly her blind
eyes sparkling with the last fitful return of her intelligence
She was speaking as he entered in a natural and lively tone
which brought back to him his earliest memories of her engaging
brightness

Are the servants all there Cynthia Then let them come and
stand inside the doora few at a time

They are here mother replied Cynthia choking and
Christopher glancing round saw several decrepit Negroes leaning
against the wallUncle Boaz Docia pressing her weak heart
and bleareyed Aunt Polly already in her dotage

I wish to tell you goodby while my mind is clear pursued the
old lady in her high sweet voice You have been good servants
to me for a long time and I hope you will live many years to
serve my children as faithfully Always remember Christopheris
Christopher there

I am here dear mother

Always remember that a mans first duty is to his wife and
children and his second to his slaves The Lord has placed them
in your hands and you must answer to Him how you fulfill the
trust And now Boazwhere is Boaz

Im yer ole miss Im right yer

You may shake my hand Boaz for it is a long goodby Ive
always promised you your freedom and I havent forgotten it
though you asked for it almost fifty years ago You did something
that I praised you forI cant quite remember what it wasand
when I asked you what you would like as a reward you answered
Dont give me nothin now ole miss but let the gift grow and
set me free when you come to die It is a long time Boaz fifty
years but I give you your freedom now as I promised though it
is very foolish of you to want it and Im sure youll find it
nothing but a burden and a trouble Christopher will you
remember that Boaz is free

Christopher crossed the room and catching her hands in his own
sought to force her back upon the pillows but with an effort
that showed in every tense line of her face she pushed him from
her and sat erect and unsupported

Let me dismiss them first she said with her stately manner
Goodby Phyllis and Pollyandandall the rest of you You
may go now I am a little tired and I will lie down

Cynthia put the weeping servants from the room and filling a
glass with brandy held it with a shaking hand to her mothers
lips

Take this dear and lie down she said

Mrs Blake sipped the brandy obediently but as she felt her
strength revive from the strong spirit the animation reawoke in
her face and turning toward Christopher she stretched out her
hand with an appealing gesture

There is so much to say and I havent the space to say it in my
son There is so much advice I want to give you but the time is
short

I understand mother I understand Dont let it trouble you

I have had a fortunate life my child resumed the old lady
waving him to silence with a gesture in which there was still a
feeble sprightliness and when one has lived happily far into
the seventies one learns a great deal of wisdom and there is
much good advice that one ought to leave behind You have been an
affectionate son to me Christopher and I have not yet given up
the hope that you may live to be a worthy husband to another
woman If you do marryand God grant that you mayremember that
the chief consideration should be family connection and the next
personal attractiveness Wealth counts for very little beside
good birth and after this I regard a small foot and hand as most
essential They have always been a mark of our breeding
Christopher and I should not like the family to lose through you
one of its most distinguished characteristics

It is not likely I shall marry mother I was cut out for
different ends

One never knows my son and at least I am only doing my duty in
speaking to you thus I am a very old woman and I am not afraid
to die for I have never to my knowledge done anything that was
unbecoming in a lady Remember to be a gentleman and you will
find that that embraces all morality and a good deal of
religion

He kissed her hand watching anxiously the mounting excitement in
her face

And if you do marry Christopher she went on harping fitfully
on her favourite string remember that keeping in love is as
much the profession for a man as it is the art for a woman and
that love feeds on little delicacies rather than on meat and
drink Dont forget the little things dear and the big ones
will take care of themselves I have seen much of men and manners
in my life and they have taught me that it is the small
failings not the big faults which are deadliest to love Why
Ive seen a romantic passion survive shame and treachery and
even blows and another wither out of existence before the first
touch of bad breeding A mans table manners are a part of his
morality your Greatgrandfather Bolivar used to say

She laughed softly while her hand played with the white fringe on
the counterpane

I can recall now the sympathy I felt for Matty Gordon she
pursued a great belle and beauty who ran off and married that
scamp Aleck Douglas He turned into a perfect rascal they said
though I must admit that he made a very amiable husband and
never stinted her even if he stole from other people Well she
stuck to him through good and evil report and was really from
all appearances a most contented woman When he died at last
people said that it was just in time to escape the penitentiary
but to see Matty you would have thought she had lost nothing
short of pure perfection Poor old Bishop Deane who always would
speak his mind in the pulpit or out of it went to call on her
he told me and took occasion to reprove her for such excessive
grief over so unworthy an object He was not an upright man
Matty and you know it he began quite boldly he was a
libertine and a gambler and an open scoffer at religion But
Matty went on sobbing harder than ever and at last getting
angry he said sternly And more than this maam he was as
you know a faithless and disloyal husband Then the poor girl
drew out a pocket handkerchief with a threeinch black border and
mopped her pretty blue eyes Ah but Bishop I had so much to
be thankful for she said He never chewed tobacco Well
well she may have been a fool as the Bishop insisted but he
was a man in spite of his cloth and could never learn to
understand a womans sensibilities

She finished and turning touched him gently on the hand

It is the little things that count in marriage Christopher
and after a moment she added thoughtfully Promise me that you
will always use an ashtray

Anything dear mother I promise anything

With a contented sigh she closed her eyes and still holding his
hand fell into a broken and troubled sleep from which she awoke
presently in a gentle delirium Her lost youth had returned to
her and with it something of her old gaiety of manner Suddenly
he felt a strange thrill pass through her and raising herself
with a last great endeavour she sat erect staring into the blue
sky that showed through the window

I am engaged for this set sir she said in her winning voice
while a girlish smile transfigured her wan face but if it
pleases you you may put your name down for the next

Rising he bent quickly over her but before he touched her she
had fallen back upon the pillows and lay with her arch smile
frozen upon her face



CHAPTER V Christopher Plants by Moonlight

At midnight they left him to watch alone in her chamber and
while he sat in the shadow beside the tester bed his thoughts
encircled the still form on the white counterpane On the mantel
two candles burned dimly and the melted tallow dripped slowly
down into the tall brass candlesticks The dimity curtains of the
bed fluttered softly in the breeze that blew through the open
window and in his nostrils there was the scent of the single
rose standing in a glass vase upon the table Tucker had brought
her the rose that morning and she had held it for a pleased
moment in her trembling fingers Everything in the room around
him was ready for her useher nightcap lay on the bureau and in
the china tray beside it he saw her brush and comb in which a
long strand of white hair was still twisted On her hands folded
quietly upon her breast he caught the flash of Docias piece of
purple glass and he remembered with a throb of pain that she had
asked that her betrothal ring might be buried with her

Well she knows all now he thought in bitterness She knows
the theft of the diamond and the deception that lasted nearly
thirty years In the midst of his sorrow a sudden shame
possessed him and he felt all at once that his heart was pierced
by the unearthly keenness of the dead eyes She knows all now
he repeated and there was a passionate defiance in his
acknowledgment She knows all that I have hidden from her as
well as much that has been hidden from me Her blind eyes are
open and she sees at last my failure and my sin and the agony
that I have known For years I have shielded her but she cannot
shield me now for all her wider vision She can avert my fate no
more than I could hold her back from hers We are each
aloneshe and I and Maria and the boy whom I have ruinedand
there is no love that can keep a man from living and dying to
himself

It seemed to him sitting there in the shadow that he felt as he
had felt before in grave momentsthe revolutions of the wheel on
which he was bound And with that strange mystic insight which
comes to those who lead brooding and isolated lives close to
Nature he asked himself if after all these things had not had
their beginning in the dawn of his existence so many million
years ago Has it not all happened before as it happens nowmy
shame and my degradation the kiss I placed on Marias lips and
the watch I keep by the deathbed of my mother It is all familiar
to me and when the end comes that will be familiar too

A night moth entered wheeling in dizzy circles about the candle
but when it went so near as to scorch its wings he caught it
gently in his hollowed palms and released it into the darkness of
the yard As he leaned out he saw the light shining clear in
Marias window and while he gazed upon it he felt a curious
kinship with the moth that had flown in from the night and
hovered about the flame

As the days went on the emptiness in the house became to him
like that of the grave and he learned presently that the peevish
and exacting old lady who had not stirred for years from her
sickbed had left a vacancy larger than all the rest of them
could fill Cynthia who had borne most of the burden began now
to bear in its place the heavier share of the loss Released
from her daily sacrifice and her patient drudgery she looked
about her with dazed eyes like one whose future has been
suddenly swept away There was nothing for her to do any longer
no risings in the gray dawn to prepare the days stealthy work
no running on aching feet to answer unreasonable complaints no
numberless small lies to plan in secret no stinting of herself
that her mother might have her little luxuries Her work was
over and she pined away in the first freedom of her life The
very fact that deception was no longer necessary seemed to sweep
her accustomed moorings from beneath her feet She had lied so
long that lying had become at last a second nature to her and to
her surprise she found almost an indecency in the aspect of the
naked truth

I dont know how it is Uncle Tucker she said one day toward
the end of June when the deadly drought which had kept back the
transplanting of the tobacco had ended in three days of heavy
rainI dont know how it is but the thing I miss mostand I
miss her every minuteis the lying I had to do It gave me
something to think about somehow I used to stay awake at night
and plan all sorts of pleasant lies that I could tell about the
house and the garden and the way the war ended and the
Presidents of the ConfederacyI made up all their namesand the
fuss with which each one was inaugurated and the dresses their
wives and daughters wore Its all so dull when you have to stop
pretending and begin to face things just as they are Ive lied
for almost thirty years and I reckon Ive lost my taste for the
truth

Well it will come back dear responded Tucker reassuringly
but I think you need a change if a woman ever did What about
that week youre to spend with the Weatherbys

Im going tomorrow answered Cynthia shortly Lila is sick
with a cold and wants me but how you and Christopher will manage
to get on is more than I can say

Oh well worry along with Docia never fear replied Tucker
hobbling into his seat at the supper table as Christopher came
in from the woods with the heavy moisture dripping from his
clothes

Its cleared off fine and theres to be a full moon tonight
said the young man hanging up his hat If the rain had come a
week later the tobacco would have been ruined Ive just been
taking it up out of the plantbed

Youll begin setting it out tomorrow I reckon then observed
Tucker watching Cynthia as she cut up his food

Oh Im afraid to waitthe ground dries so quickly Jacob
Weatherby is going to set his out tonight and I think Ill do
the same Theres a fine moon and I shouldnt wonder if every
farmer in the county was in the fields till daybreak

He ate his supper hurriedly and then taking down his hat went
out to resume his work At the door he had left his big split
basket of plants and slipping his arm through the handle he
crossed the yard in the direction of the field As he turned into
the little path which trailed in wet grass along the worm
fence Jacob Weatherby came stepping briskly through the mud in
the road and stopped to ask him if he had got his ground ready
for the setting out Ive been lookin for hands myself added
the old man in his cheery voice for I could find work for a
dozen men tonight but to save my life I cant scrape up moren
a nigger here an thar Bill Fletcher has been out ahead of me
it seems

Well Ill be able to help you tomorrow I think answered
Christopher I hope to get my own work done tonight Then he
asked with a trifling hesitation How is Lilas cold

A sudden light broke over old Jacobs face and he nodded in his
genial fashion

Ah bless her pretty eyes I sometimes think shes too good to
put her foot down on this here common earth he said an to
think that only this mornin she was wantin to help Sarah wipe
the dishes Why I reckon Sarah would ruther work her fingers to
the bone than have that gal take a single dishcloth in her hand
Oh we know how to value her Mr Christopher never fear Her
words law in our house and always will be

He passed on with his hearty chuckle and Christopher followed
the wet path and began planting his tobacco plants in the small
holes he bored in the moist earth

It was the most solemn hour of day when the division between
light and darkness seems less a gradation than a sudden blur A
faint yellow line still lingered across the western horizon and
against it the belt of pines rose like an advancing army The
wind which blew toward him from the woods filled his nostrils
with a spicy tang

Slowly the moon rose higher flooding the hollows and the low
green hills with light In the outlying fields around the Hall he
saw Fletchers planters at work in the tobacco each man so
closely followed by his shadow that it was impossible at a little
distance to distinguish the living labourer from his airy double
All the harsh irregularities of the landscape were submerged in a
general softness of tone and the shapes of hill and meadow of
road and tree of shrub and rock were dissolved in a magical and
enchanting beauty

Several hours had passed and he had stopped to rest a moment
from his planting when Maria came in the moonlight along the
road and paused breathlessly to lean upon the fence beneath the
locust tree

It is the first time Ive been out for two weeks she said
panting softly I twisted my ankle and the worst part was that
I didnt even dare to send you word What must you have thought

No harm of you he answered and threw down the fencerails
that she might cross Come over to me Maria

Putting her hands in his she passed over the lowered fence and
then stood at arms length looking into his face which the
moonlight had softened to a beauty that brought to her mind a
carving in old ivory

I still limp a little she went on smiling and I had to
steal out like a thief and run through the shadows To find me
with you would be the death of grandfather I believe Something
has occurred to put him in a fresh rage with you

It was the field by the pasture he told her frankly You know
it belongs to me and pure justice made me throw down his fence
but if you wish it I will put it up again Ill do anything you
wish

She thought for a moment with that complete detachment of
judgment from emotion which is so rarely a part of a womans
intellect

No no she said it is right that you should take it down I
would not have you submit to any further injustice not even a
little one like that

And this will go on forever Oh Maria how will it end

We must wait and hope dear you see that

I see nothing but that I love you and am most miserable he
answered desperately

A smile curved her lips Oh blind and faithless I see only
you

He was still holding her hands but dropping them as she spoke
he threw his arms wide open and stood waiting

Then come to me my dearest come to me

His voice rang out in command rather than entreaty and he stood
smiling gravely as hesitating a breathless instant she regarded
him with eyes that struggled to be calm Then slowly the radiance
which was less the warmth of colour than of expression flooded
her face and she bent toward him as if impelled by some strong
outside force The next moment the storm swept her roughly from
her feet and crushed back her pleading hands upon her bosom
bewildered flushed and trembling she lay upon his breast while
their lips clung together Oh my friend my lover she
murmured faintly

He felt her resistance dissolve within his arms and it was a
part of the tragedy of their love that there should come to him
no surprise when he found her mouth salt from her tears The
shadow of a great evil of a secret anguish still divided them
and it was this that gave to their embraces the sorrowful passion
which he drew from her despairing kiss

You cannot love me Maria How can it be true

Releasing herself she put her hand upon his lips to silence him

You have made your confession she said earnestly with the
serene dignity which had impressed him in the first moment of
their meeting and now I will make mine You must not stop me
you must not look at me until I finish Promise

I promise to keep silent he answered with his gaze upon her

She drew away from him keeping her eyes full on his and holding
him at arms length with the tips of her fingers He felt that
she was still shaken by his embracethat she was still in a
quiver from his kisses but to all outward seeming she had
regained the noble composure of her bearing

No no Ah listen my friend and do not touch me What I must
tell you is this and you must hear me patiently to the end I
have loved you alwaysfrom the first day since the beginning
There has never been any one else and there has never been a
moment in my life when I would not have followed you had you
lifted a finger anywhere At first I did not knowI did not
believe it It was but a passing fancy I thought that you had
murdered I taught myself to believe that I was cold inhuman
because I did not warm to other men Oh I did not know then that
I was not stone but ice which would melt at the first touch of
the true flame 

Maria he burst out in a cry of anguish

Hush Hush Remember your promise It was not until afterward
she went on in the same quiet voice it was not until my
marriagenot until my soul shuddered back from his embraces and
I dreamed of you that I began to seeto understand

Oh Maria my beloved if I had known

She still held him from her with her outstretched arm

It was the knowledge of this that made me feel that I had
wronged himthat I had defrauded him of the soul of love and
given him only the poor flesh It was this that held me to him
all those wretched yearsthat kept me with him till the end
even through his madness At last I buried your memory told
myself that I had forgotten

We will let the world go dearest he said passionately Come
to me

But she shook her head and still smiling held him at a
distance

It will never go she answered for it is not the worlds way
But whatever comes to us there is one thing you must
rememberthat you must never forget for one instant while you
live In good or evil in life or death there is no height so
high nor any depth so low that I will not follow you

Then waving him from her with a decisive gesture she turned from
him and went swiftly home across the moonlit fields



CHAPTER VI Treats of the Tragedy Which Wears a Comic Mask

As she hastened on Christophers presence was still with
herhis arm still enveloped her his voice still spoke in her
ears and so rapt was the ecstasy in which she moved that it was
with a positive shock that she found herself presently before the
little area which led into the brick kitchen in the basement of
the Hall Here from the darkness her name was spoken in a stifled
voice while a hand reached out and clutched her by the shoulder

I say Maria Ive been waiting hours to speak to you

Forcing back the cry upon her lips she opened the door and stole
softly into the kitchen Then turning she faced Will with a
frightened gesture

How recklesshow very reckless she exclaimed in a whisper

He closed the door that led up into the house and coming over to
the stove where the remains of a fire still smouldered in a deep
red glow stood looking at her with nervous twitches of his
reddened eyelids There was a wildness in his face before which
she fell back appalled and his whole appearance from the damp
hair lying in streaks upon his forehead to his restless feet
which he shuffled continually as he talked betrayed an agitation
so extreme as to cause her a renewed pang of foreboding

Oh Will you have been drinking again she said in the same
frightened whisper

And why not he demanded throwing out his words between thick
breaths What business is it of yours or of anybody elses if I
have been A pretty sister you arearent youto let a fellow
rot away on a tobacco farm while you wear diamonds on your
fingers

She looked at him steadily for a moment and his shifting glance
fell slowly to the floor

If you are in any fresh trouble you may as well tell me at
once she said It is a mere waste of time and breath to
reproach me You cant possibly make me angry tonight for I
wear an armour of which you do not dream and so little a thing
as abuse does not even touch me Besides grandfather may hear us
and come down at any moment So speak quickly

Her coolness sobered him instantly as if a splash of icewater
had been thrown into his face and his tone lost its
aggressiveness and sank into a whimpering complaint

It was the same old thing he went on only worse and worse
Molly had been ill again and the doctor ordered medicine he
couldnt buy Yes he had tried to take the diamond from her but
she flew into hysterics at the mere mention of selling it Once
he had dragged it off her finger and had given it back again
because her wildness frightened him Why on earth did you ever
let her have it he finished querulously

Well I never imagined she would be quite so silly returned
Maria distressed by what she heard But it may be that jewels
are really her passion and the bravest of us I suppose are
those who sacrifice most for their dearest desire I really dont
see what is to be done Will I havent any money and I dont
dare ask grandfather for he makes me keep a strict account of
every cent I spend Only yesterday he told me he couldnt allow
me but two postage stamps a week and yet I believe that he is
worth considerably more than half a million dollars Sometimes I
think it is nothing short of pure insanity he grows so miserly
about little things Aunt Saidie and I have both noticed that he
would rather spend a hundred dollarsthough it is like drawing
out an eyetooththan keep a pound of fresh butter from the
market

And yet he likes you

Oh he tolerates me as far as that goes but I dont believe he
likes anything on earth except his money Its his great passion
just as Mollys love of jewelry is hers There is something so
tremendous about it that one cant help respect it As for me he
only bears with my presence so long as I ask him for absolutely
nothing He knows I have my little property and we had a
dreadful scene when I refused to let him keep my checkbook I
gave you all the interest of the last six months you know and
the other isnt due until November If he finds out that it goes
to you heaven help us

And theres not the faintest hope of his coming to his senses
Have you spoken of me again

Ive mentioned your name twice that was all He rose and
stamped out of the room and didnt speak for days Aunt Saidie
and I have planned to bring the baby over when it comes That may
soften himespecially if it should be a boy

Oh the bottom will drop out of things by that time he
returned savagely tearing pieces of straw from his worn
hatbrim If this keeps up much longer Maria I warn you now
Ill run away Ill go off some day on a freight train and hide
my head until he dies then Ill come back to enjoy his precious
money

She sighed thinking hopelessly of the altered will

And Molly she questioned for lack of a more effectual
argument

I cant stop to think of Molly it drives me mad What use am I
to her anyway Id like to know Shed be quite as well off
without me for we do nothing but quarrel now night and day and
yet I love herI love her awfully he added in a drunken
whimper

Oh Will Will be a man for her sake

I cant I cant he protested his voice rising in anger I
cant stand the squalor of this life its killing me Why look
at the way I was brought up never stopping an instant to ask
whether I could have a thing I wanted He had no right to
accustom me to luxuries till I couldnt do without them and then
throw me out upon the world like this

Hush Hush Your voice is too loud It will bring him down

Ill be hanged if I care he retorted but involuntarily he
lowered his tone

You mustnt stay here five minutes longer urged Maria Ill
give you a diamond brooch I still have left and you may take it
to town yourself and sell it Only promise me on your honour that
you will spend the money on the things Molly needs

Oh I promise he replied roughly Where is it

In my room I must get it now Be perfectly quiet until I
return

Opening the door and closing it carefully behind her she stole
noiselessly up the dark staircase while Will twitching
nervously paced restlessly up and down the brick floor A pile
of walnuts which Miss Saidie had been shelling for cake lay on
the hearth and picking up the heavy old hammer she had used he
cracked a nut and ate it hurriedly Hungry as he wasfor he had
not been home to supperhe found difficulty in swallowing and
laying the hammer down upon the bricks he rose and stood waiting
beside the stove Though the night was warm a shiver ran
suddenly through him and stirring the fading embers with a
splinter of resinous pine he held out his shaking hands to the
blaze

In a moment Maria entered and handed him the brooch in a little
box

Try to keep up courage Will she said pushing him into the
area under the back steps and above all things do not come
here again It is so unsafe

He promised lightly that he would not and then told her goodby
with an affectionate pat upon the arm

Well you are a bully good chap after all he added as he
stepped out into the night

For a while Maria stood looking after him across the moonlit
fields and then even as she turned to enter the house the last
troubled hour was blotted from her consciousness and she lived
over again the moment of Christophers embrace With that
peculiar power to revive and hold within the memory an instants
emotion which is possessed by ardent and imaginative women she
experienced again all the throbbing exhilaration all the fulness
of being which had seemed to crowd the heartbeats of so many
ordinary years into the single minute that was packed with life
That minute was hers now for all time it was a possession of
which no material loss no untoward fate could defraud her and
as she felt her steps softly up the dark staircase it seemed to
her that she saw her way by the light of the lamp that was
burning in her bosom

To her surprise as she reached the diningroom a candle was
thrust out before her and illuminated by the trembling flame
she saw the face of Fletcher hairy bloated sinister with the
shadow of evil impulses worked into the mouth and eyes For a
moment he wagged at her in silence and in the flickering
radiance she saw each swollen vein each gloomy furrow with
exaggerated distinctness He reminded her vaguely of some hideous
gargoyle she had seen hanging from an early Gothic cathedral

So youve taken to gallivanting like the rest he observed
with coarse pleasantry Id thought you were a staid and
soberminded woman for your years but it seems that you are of a
bunch with all the others

Ive been out in the moonlight answered Maria while a
sensation of sickness stole over her

It is as bright as day but I thought you were in bed long ago

Thars not much sleep for me during tobacco planting I kin tell
you rejoined Fletcher but as for you I reckon thars more
beneath your words than you like to own to Youve been over to
see that young scamp aint you

I saw him but I did not go out for that purpose

Its the truth I reckon for Ive never known you to lie and
Ill be hanged if it aint that I like about you after all
Youre the only person I kin spot man or woman who speaks the
truth jest for the darn love of it

And yet I lived a lie for five years returned Maria quietly

Maybe so maybe so but it set on you like the burr on a
chestnut somehow and when it rolled off thar you were as clean
as ever Well youre an honest and spunky woman and I cant
help your traipsing over thar even if I wanted to But thars one
thing I tell you now right flatif that young rascal wants to
keep a whole skin hed better stay off this place Id shoot him
down as soon as I would a sheepkilling hound

Oh he wont come here said Maria faintly and going into the
diningroom she dropped into a chair and lay with her arms
outstretched upon the table The second shock to her emotional
ecstasy had been too much and the furniture and Fletchers face
and the glare of the candle all spun before her in a sickening
confusion

After looking at her anxiously an instant Fletcher poured out a
glass of water and begged her to take a swallow Thar thar I
didnt mean to skeer you he said kindly You mustnt mind my
roughandready ways for Im a plain man God knows If you are
sure you feel fainty he added Ill git you a sip of whisky
but its a pity to waste it unless you have a turn

Oh Im all right answered Maria sitting up and returning
his inquiring gaze with a shake of the head My ankle is still
weak you know and I felt a sudden twinge from standing on it
What were you looking for at this hour

Well Ive been out in the air sense supper and I feel kind of
gone I thought Id like a bite of somethingmaybe a scrap of
that cold jowl we had for dinner But I cant find it Do you
reckon Saidie is such a blamed fool as to throw the scraps away

Theres Malindy you know she must eat

Id like to see one nigger eat up half a jowl grumbled
Fletcher rooting among the dishes in the sideboard Thar was a
good big hunk of it left for you didnt touch it You dont seem
to thrive on our victuals he added bluntly turning to peer
into her face

Im a small eater it makes little difference

Well we mustnt starve you he said as he went back to his
search and if its a matter of a pound of fresh butter or a
spring chicken even I wont let it stand in your way Why
whats this I wonder

Ripping out an oath with an angry snort he drew forth Miss
Saidies walnut cake and held it squarely before the candle I
declar if she aint been making walnut cake agin and I told her
last week I want going to have her wasting all my eggs Look at
it will you If shes beat up one egg in that cake shes beat up
a dozen to say nothing of the sugar

Dont scold her grandfather She has a sweet tooth you know
and its so hard for her not to make desserts

Pish Tush I dont reckon her tooths any sweeter than mine
Ive a powerful taste for trash myself and always had since the
time I overate ripe honeyshucks when I was six months old but
the taste dont make me throw away good money Ill have no more
of this I tell you and Ive said my say She can bake a bit of
cake once a week if shell stint herself to an egg or two but
when it comes to mixing up a dozen at a time Ill be darned if
Ill allow it

Lifting the plate in one hand he stood surveying the big cake
with disapproving yet admiring eyes It would serve her right if
I was to eat up every precious crumb he remarked at last

Suppose you try it suggested Maria pleasantly It would
please Aunt Saidie

It aint to please her sourly responded Fletcher as he drove
the knife with a lunge into the yellow loaf Shes a thriftless
noaccount housekeeper and Ill tell her so tomorrow

Still holding the knife in his clenched fist he sat munching the
cake with a relish which brought a smile to Marias tired eves

Yes Ive a powerful sweet tooth myself he added as he cut
another slice



CHAPTER VII Will Faces Desperation and Stands at Bay

Rising at daybreak next morning Wills eyes lighted in his first
glance from the window on Christophers blueclad figure
commanding the ploughed field on the left of the house In the
distance towered the black pines and against them the solitary
worker was relieved in the slanting sunbeams which seemed to
arrest and hold his majestic outline The split basket of plants
was on his arm and he was busily engaged in setting out Wills
neglected crop of tobacco

Leaving Molly still asleep Will dressed himself hurriedly and
putting the diamond brooch in his pocket ran out to where
Christopher was standing midway of the bare field

So youre doing my work again he said not ungratefully

If I didnt Id like to know who would responded Christopher
with rough kindliness as he dropped a wilted plant into a hole
Youre up early this morning Where are you off to

Will drew the brooch from his pocket and held it up with a laugh

Maria gave me this he explained and Im going to town to
turn it into money

Well Ill keep an eye on the place while you are away
returned Christopher without looking at the trinket Go about
your business and for heavens sake dont stop to drink Some
men can stand liquor you cant It makes a beast of you

And not of you eh

It never gets the chance I know when to stop Thats the
difference between us

Of course thats the difference rejoined Will a little
doggedly I never know when to stop about anything Ill be
hanged if I do Its my cursed luck to go at a headlong gait

And some day youll get your neck broken Well be off now or
youll most likely miss the stage

He turned away to sort the young plants in his basket while Will
started at a brisk pace for the crossroads

The planting was tedious work and it was almost evening before
Christopher reached the end of the field and started home along
the little winding lane He had eaten a scant dinner with Molly
who had worried him by tearful complaints across the turnip
salad She had never looked prettier than in her thin white
blouse with her disordered curls shadowing her blue eyes and he
had never found her more frankly selfish Her shallowrooted
nature awakened in him a feeling that was akin to repulsion and
he saw in imagination the gallant resolution with which Maria
would have battled against such sordid miseries At the first
touch of her heroic spirit they would have been sordid no longer
for into the most squalid suffering her golden nature would have
shed something of its sunshine Beauty would have surrounded her
in Wills cabin as surely as in Blake Hall And with the thought
there came to him the knowledge wrung from experience that
there are souls which do not yield to events but bend and shape
them into the likeness of themselves No favouring circumstance
could have evolved Maria out of Molly nor could any crushing one
have formed Molly from Marias substance The two women were as
far asunder as the poles united only by a certain softness of
sex he found in them both

The sun had dropped behind the pines and a gray mist was floating
slowly across the level landscape The fields were still in
daylight while dusk already enshrouded the leafy road and it
was from out the gloom that obscured the first short bend that he
saw presently emerge the figure of a man who appeared to walk
unsteadily and with an effort

For an instant Christopher stopped short in the lane then he
went forward at a single impetuous stride

Will he cried in a voice of thunder

Will looked up with dazed eyes and seeing who had called him
burst into a loud and boisterous laugh

So youll begin with your darn preaching he remarked gaping

For reply Christopher reached out and seizing him by the
shoulder shook him roughly to his senses

Whats the meaning of this tomfoolery he demanded Do you
mean to say youve made a beast of yourself after all

Partly sobered by the shock Will gazed back at him with a dogged
misery which gave his face the colour of extreme old age

Im not so drunk as I look he responded bitterly I wish to
Heaven I were There are worse things than being drunk though
you wont believe it I say he added in a sudden hysterical
exclamation youre the only friend I have on earth

Nonsense What have you been doing

Oh I couldnt help itit wasnt my fault Ill be blamed if it
was I did sell the breastpin and get the money and wrapped it
in the list of things that Molly wanted I put them in my
pocket he finished touching his coat the money and the list
together

And where is it

For a moment Will did not reply but stood shaking like a blade
of grass in a high wind Then removing his hat he mopped feebly
at the beads of sweat upon his forehead His eyes had the dumb
appeal of a frightened animals I havent had a morsel all
day he whimpered and the effect of the whisky has all worn
off

Speak up man said Christopher kindly I cant eat you

Oh its not you returned Will desperately its Molly Im
afraid to go home and look Molly in the face

Pish She doesnt bite

She does worse she cries

Then for Gods sake out with the trouble urged Christopher
losing patience Youve lost the money I take it but how

There was a fair groaned Will his voice breaking I met Fred
Turner and a strange man who owned horses and they asked me to
come and watch the racing Then we had drinks and began to bet
and somehow I always lost after the first time Before I knew it
the money was all gone every single cent and I owed Fred Turner
a hundred and fifty dollars

Christophers gaze travelled slowly up and down the slight figure
before him and he swore softly beneath his breath

Well you have made a mess of it he exclaimed with a laugh

I knew youd say so and youre the only friend I have on earth
As for Mollyoh Im afraid to go home thats all Do you know
Ive half a mind to run away for good

Pshaw Accidents will happen and theres nothing in all this to
take the pluck out of a man Ive been through worse things
myself

But Fred Turner groaned Will I promised him Id pay him in
two days

Then youll do it Ill undertake to see to that

You exclaimed the other with so abject a reliance upon the
spoken word that it brought a laugh from Christophers lips How
will you manage it

Oh somehowmortgage the farm I reckon At any rate in two
days you shall be clear of your debt to Fred Turner theres my
word All I hope is that youll learn a lesson from the fright

Oh I will I will and by Jove you are a bully chap

Then go home and make your peace with Molly Mind you if you
get in liquor again I warn you I wont lift a hand

With a last cheery good night he swung on along the road
dismissing the thought of Will to invoke that of Maria and
meeting again in fancy the rich promise of her upturned lips
Body and soul she was his now flame and clay true brain and
true heart I will follow you for the lifting of a finger
anywhere she had said and the words reeled madly in his
thoughts Her impassioned look returned to him and he closed his
eyes as a man does in the face of an emotion which proclaims him
craven

When Christophers footsteps had faded in the distance Will who
had been looking wistfully after him shook together his
dissolving courage and started with a strengthened purpose to
bear the bad news to Molly A light streamed through the broken
shutters of her window and when he laid his hand upon the door
it shot open and she stood before him

So youre back at last she said sharply and late again

I couldnt help it he answered with assumed indifference
entering and passing quickly under the fire of her questioning
look I was kept

What kept you

Oh business

Id like to know what business you have she retorted
querulously and a minute later Have you brought the medicine

He went over to the table and stood looking gloomily down upon
the scattered remains of supper upon the sloppy oilcloth the
cracked earthenware teapot and the plate half filled with soppy
bread Give me something to eat Im almost starved he
pleaded

A flash shot from her blue eyes while the anger he had feared
worked threateningly in the features of her pretty face There
was no temperateness about Molly she was all storm or sunshine
he had once said in the poetic days of courtship

If youve brought the things where are they she demanded
driving him squarely into a corner from which there was no escape
by subterfuge

A sullen defiance showed in his aspect and he turned upon her
with a muttered curse I havent them if you want the truth
he snarled I meant to buy them but Fred Turner got me to
drinking and we bet on the races I lost the money

To Fred Turner cried Molly Oh you fool

He made an angry movement toward her then checking himself
laughed bitterly

Youre as bad as grandfather he said and its like jumping
from the fryingpan into the fire Ill be hanged if I knew you
were a shrew when I married you

Mollys eyes fairly blazed and as she shook her head with an
enraged gesture her hair tumbling upon her shoulders flooded
her with light Even in the midst of his fury his ready senses
responded to the appeal of her dishevelled loveliness

And Ill beanything if I knew you were a drunkard she
retorted pressing her hand upon her panting breast

Well you ought to have known it he sneered for I was one
Christopher Blake could have told you so But if I remember
rightly you werent so precious particular at the time You were
glad enough to get anybody as it happened

Howhow dare you wailed Molly in the helplessness of her
rage and throwing herself upon the lounge she beat her hands
upon the wooden sides and burst into despairing sobs Why oh
why did I marry you she moaned between choking gasps

Some said it was because Fred Turner threw you over returned
Will savagely and having hurled his last envenomed dart he
seized his hat and rushed out into the night

The scene had worked like madness on his nerves and in the
darkness of the lane where the trees kept out the moonbeams he
still saw the flickering lights that he had left behind him in
the room He had eaten nothing all day and his empty stomach
oppressed him with a sensation of nausea His head spun like a
top and as he walked the road rocked in long seesaws beneath his
feet Yet his one craving was for drink drink more drink

Running rather than walking he reached the store at last and
went back to the little smoky room where Tom Spade was drawing
beer from the big keg in one corner

Give me something to eat Tom Im starving he said and
whisky I must have whisky or Ill die

Its my belief that youll die if you do have it responded
Tom As for bread and meat however Susan will give you a bite
an welcome Nevertheless he poured out the whisky and
leaving it upon one of the dirty tables went hastily out in
search of Mrs Spade

Lifting the glass with a shaking hand Will drained it at a
single swallow feeling his depleted courage revive as the raw
spirit burned his throat A sudden heat invaded him his eyes saw
clearer and the tips of his fingers were endowed with a new
quality of touch As his hands travelled slowly over his face he
became aware that he was looking through his finger ends and he
noted distinctly his haggard features and the short growth of
beard which made him appear jaded and unwashed Then almost
instantly the quickness died out of his perception and he felt
the old numbness creeping back

Another glassI must have another glass he called out
irritably to the empty room His hands hung stone dead again at
his sides and his head dropped limply forward upon his breast
He had forgotten his quarrel with Molly he had forgotten
everything except his own miserable bodily condition

When Susan Spade came in with a plate of bread and ham he roused
himself with a nervous start and inhaled quickly the strong odour
of the meat endeavouring through the sense of smell to reawaken
the pang of hunger he had felt earlier in the evening But in
place of the gnawing emptiness there had come now a deadly
nausea and after the first mouthful or two he pushed the food
away and called hoarsely for more whisky His head ached in loud
reverberating throbs and a queer fancy possessed him that the
sound must be as audible to others as to himself With the
thought he glanced about suspiciously but Tom Spade was
stopping the keg that he had tapped and Susan was wiping off the
table with energetic sweeps of her checked apron Relieved by
their impassiveness he braced himself with the determination to
drink to the deadline of unconsciousness and then lie down
somewhere in the darkness to sleep off the effects

Whiskygive me more whisky he repeated angrily

But Mrs Spade true to her nature saw fit to intervene between
him and destruction

Not another drop Mr Will she said decisively Not another
drop shall you have in this room if its the last mortal word I
speak An if youd had me by you in the beginning Im not
afeard to say things would have held up a long sight sooner than
this

Dont you see Im in downright agony groaned Will rapping the
glass upon the table My head is splitting I tell you and I
must have it

Not another drop suh replied Mrs Spade with adamantine
firmness of tone I aint a weak woman thank the Lord an as
far as that goes you might split to pieces inside and out right
here befo my eyes an I wouldnt be a party to sendin you a
step nearer damnation I aint afeard of seein folks suffer Tom
will tell you that

That she aint suh agreed Tom with pride If I do say it who
shouldnt thar never was a woman who could stand mo pain in
other people than can Susan Mo than that Mr Will shes
right though Id be sayin so even if she wasntseein that
the only rule for makin a woman think yo way is always to think
hers But shes right and thats the truth Youve had too
much

Oh youre driving me mad between you cried Will in
desperation Im in awful trouble and theres nothing under
heaven will make me forget it except drink One glass morejust
one That cant hurt me

May he have one glass Susan asked Tom appealing to his wife

Not another drop suh returned Mrs Spade immovable as a
rock

Not another drop she says repeated the big storekeeper in a
sinking voice Then he laid his hand sympathetically on Wills
shoulder To be sure I know youre in trouble he said an
Ill swear its an outanout shame I dont care who hears me
Yes Ill stand to it in the very face of Bill Fletcher himself

Oh hes a devil cried Will stung by the name he hated

I aint sayin youve been all you should have been pursued
Tom in his friendly tones but as I told Susan yestiddy a body
cant sow wild oats in one generation without havin a volunteer
crop spring up in the next Now yo wild oats were sown long
befo you were born Aint that so Susan

Mrs Spade planted her hands squarely upon her hips and stood her
ground with a solidity which was as impressive in its way as
dignity

Ive spoken my mind to Bill Fletcher she said an Ill speak
it again Hows that boy goin to live suh Thats what I
asked an twas after he told me to shut my mouth that it was
Right or wrong thats what I told him Youve gone an made the
meanest will this county has ever seen

What cried Will springing to his feet while the room whirled
round him

Thar thar Susan youve talked too much interposed Tom a
little frightened What she means is just some foolishness yo
grandpas been lettin out he added but hell live long
enough yet to change his mind an his will too

What is it about Speak louder will you My ears buzz so I
cant hear thunder

Tom coughed reproachfully at Susan

Well he was talkin down here last night about havin changed
his will he said apologetically Hes tied it up it seems so
you cant get it an hes gone an left the bulk of it to Mrs
Wyndham

To Maria repeated Will and saw scarlet

Thats what he says but hell last to change his mind yet
never fear Anger doesnt live as long as a maneh Susan

But Will had risen and was walking quite steadily toward the
door His face was dead white and there were deep blue circles
about his eyes which sparkled brilliantly When he turned for a
moment before going out he sucked in his under lip with a
hissing sound

So this was Marias trick all along he said hoarsely



CHAPTER VIII How Christopher Comes Into His Revenge

So this was Marias trick all along he repeated as he lurched
out into the road This was what she had schemed for from the
beginningthis was what her palavering and her protestations
meant Oh it had been a deep game from the first only he had
been too much of a blind fool to see the truth A hundred facts
arose to drive in the discovery a hundred trivial details now
bristled with importance Why had she been so willingso eager
evento give away her little property unless she intended to
divert him with the crumbs while she reached for the whole loaf
Why again had she shrunk so from mentioning him to his
grandfather And why still further had she always fearfully
postponed a meeting between the two He remembered suddenly that
she had once drawn Molly behind the trees when the old man passed
along the road Poor defrauded Molly Forgetting his bitter
quarrel with her he was ready to fall upon her neck in maudlin
sympathy

Yes it was all plain nowas clear as day He saw one by one
each devilish move that she had made and he meant to pay her
back for all before the night was over He would tell her what he
thought of her freely fully in words that she would never
forget The names that he would use the curses he would utter
spun deliriously in his head and as he went on he found himself
speaking his phrases aloud to the darkness trying upon the
silence the effect of each blighting sentence

The lights of the Hall twinkled presently among the trees and
crossing the lawn he crept into the little area under the back
steps If Maria was not in the kitchen the servant would be he
argued and he would send up a peremptory summons which would
bring her down upon the instant It was not late enough for her
to be in bed at least and he chuckled over the thought of the
sleepless night which she would spend

Pushing back the door cautiously on its old rusty hinges he
entered on tiptoe and glanced suspiciously around The room was
empty but a lamp with a smoked chimney burned upon the table
and there were the glimmering embers of a wood fire in the stove
It was just as he had left it the evening before and this
aroused in him a feeling of surprise so long a stretch appeared
to cover the last twentyfour hours The same basket of chicken
feathers was in the sagging splitbottomed chair the same pile
of black walnuts lay on the hearth and the rusted hammer was
still lying where he had dropped it upon the bricks Even the
smell was the samea mixture of baked bread and burned feathers

Going to the door that led into the house he opened it and
looked up the dark staircase then a sound reached him from the
diningroom and with nervous shiver he turned away and came back
to the stove A dread paralysed him lest the meeting with Maria
should be delayed until his courage oozed out of him and to
nerve himself for the encounter he summoned to mind all the
evidence which gathered in a cloud of witnesses to prove her
treachery Once it occurred to him that after a few minutes of
waiting he might tighten the screw upon his nerves and so pluck
up the audacity if not the resolution to ascend the stair
boldly and denounce her in the presence of his grandfather But
the memory of Fletchers face wagged before him and quaking
with terror he huddled with open palms above the stove Then
pacing slowly up and down the room he set to work frantically to
lash himself into the drunken bravado which he miscalled courage

Of a sudden his hunger assailed him violent convulsive and
going over to the tin safe he rummaged among the cold scraps he
found there devouring greedily the food which lead been set by
for the hounds A bottle of Miss Saidies raspberry vinegar was
hidden in one corner and he tore the paper label from the cork
and drank like a man who perishes from thirst His energy which
had evaporated from fatigue and hunger surged back in spasms of
anger and as he turned away invigorated from the safe he
realised as he had never done before the full measure of his rage
against Maria At the moment had she come in upon him he felt
that he could have struck her in the face

But she did not come and the slow minutes fretted him in their
passage A flame shot up in the stove and catching a knot of
resinous pine burned steadily licking patiently about the
fading embers The air became charged again with the odour of
burned feathers and he saw that a handful with the dried blood
of the fowl still adhering to them had been scattered upon the
ashes As he idly noted the colours of red and black he
remembered with bitterness that he had raised gamecocks once
when he was a boy at the Hall and that Maria had smashed a
nestful of his eggs in a fit of passion The incident swelled to
enormous proportions in his thoughts and he determined that he
would remind her of it in the interview that was before them

The door into the house creaked suddenly behind him he wheeled
about nervously and then stood with hanging jaws staring into
the face of Fletcher

So it is you is it said the old man raising the stick he
carried So it is you as I suspectedyou darn rascal

But the power of speech had departed from Will in the presence
that he dreaded and he stood clutching tightly to his harvest
hat and shaking his head as if to deny the obvious fact of his
own identity

I thought it was you pursued Fletcher licking his dry lips
I heard a noise and I picked up my stick thinking it was you
Ill have no thieving beggars on my place I tell you so the
quicker you git off the better When were you here last Id like
to know

Yesterday answered Will speaking the truth from sheer
physical inability to frame a lie I came to see Maria Shes
cheated meshes cheated me all along

Then she lied said Fletcher softly Then she lied and I
didnt know it

Shes cheated me insisted Will hoarsely Its been all a
scheme of hers from the very beginning Shes cheated me about
the will grandpa I swear she has

Eh Whats that responded the old man shaking back his heavy
eyebrows Say your say right now for in five minutes you go off
this place with every hound in the pack yelping at your heels
Ill not have you hereIll not have you here

The words ended in a snarl and a fleck of foam dropped on his
gray beard

But it was all Marias doing urged Will passionately She has
been against me from the first I see that now Shes plotted to
oust me from the very start

Well she might have spared herself the trouble was Fletchers
sharp rejoinder

Let me explainlet me explain pleaded the other in a
desperate effort to gain time just a word or twoI only want a
word

But when his grandfather drew back and stood glowering upon him
in silence the speech he had wished to utter withered upon his
lips blighted by a panic terror and he stood mumbling
incoherently beneath his breath

Give me a worda word is all I want he reiterated wildly

Then out with your damned word and begone roared Fletcher

Wills eyes travelled helplessly around the room seeking in vain
some inspiration from the objects his gaze encountered The tin
safe the basket of feathers the pile of walnuts on the hearth
each arrested his wandering attention for an instant and he
beheld all the details with amazing vividness

A mouse came out into the room gliding like a shadow along the
wall to the pile of walnuts and his eyes followed it as if drawn
by an invisible thread

Its Mariaits all Maria he stuttered and could think of
nothing further His brain seemed suddenly paralysed and he
found himself tugging hopelessly at the most commonplace word
which would not come All his swaggering bravado had scampered
off at the first wag of the old mans head

If thats what youve got to say you might as well be gone
returned Fletcher moving toward him I warn you now that the
next time I find you here you wont git off so easy Maria or no
Maria you aint goin to lounge about this place so long as my
name is Bill Fletcher The farther you keep yourself and your
yallerheaded huzzy out of my sight the better Thar now be off
or youll git a licking

But I tell you Marias cheated meshes cheated me returned
Will his voice rising shrilly as he was goaded into revolt
Shes been scheming to get the place all along thats her
trick

Pish Tush responded Fletcher Are you going or are you not

Wills eyes burned like coals and an observer noting the two
men as they stood glaring at each other would have been struck
by their resemblance in attitude and expression rather than in
feature Both leaned slightly forward with their chins thrust
out and their jaws dropped and there was a ceaseless twitching
of the small muscles in both faces The beast in each had sprung
violently to the surface and recognised the likeness at which he
snarled

Youve left me to starve cried Will strangling a sob of
anger Its not fair You have no right The money ought to be
mineI swear it ought

Oh it ought ought it sneered the old man with an ugly
laugh

At the sound of the laugh Will shrank back and shivered as if
from the stroke of a whip The spirit of rage worked in his blood
like the spirit of drink and he felt his disordered nerves
respond in a sudden frenzy

It ought to be mine you devil and you know it he cried

I do do I retorted Fletcher still cackling Well jest grin
at me a minute longer like that brazen wench your mother and Ill
lay my stick across your shoulders for good and all As for my
money its mine I reckon and living or dead Ill look to it
that not one red cent gits to you Blast you Stop your
grinning

He raised the stick and made a long swerve sideways but the
other picking up the hammer from the hearth jerked it above his
head and stood braced for the assault In the silence of the room
Will heard the thumping of his own heart and the sound inspired
him like the drums of battle He was in a quiver from head to
foot but it was a quiver of rage not of fear and a glow of
pride possessed him that he could lift his eyes and look Fletcher
squarely in the face

Youre a devila devil a devil he cried shrilly sticking
out his tongue like a pert and vulgar little boy Christopher
Blake was rightyoure a devil

As the name struck him between the eyes the old man lurched back
against the stove then recovering himself he made a swift
movement forward and brought his stick down with all his force on
the boys shoulder

Take that you lying varmint he shouted choking

The next instant his weapon had dropped from his hand and he
reached out blindly grappling with the air for Will had turned
upon him with the spring of a wild beast and sent the hammer
crushing into his temple

There was a muffled thud and Fletcher went down in a huddled
heap
upon the floor while the other stood over him in the weakness
which had succeeded his drunken frenzy

I told you to let me alone I told you Id do it said Will
doggedly and a moment later I told you Id do it

The hammer was still in his hand and lifting it he examined it
with a morbid curiosity A red fleck stained the iron and
glancing down he saw that there was a splotch of blood on
Fletchers temple I told him Id do it he repeated speaking
this time to himself

Then instantly the silence in the room stopped his heartbeats and
set him quaking in a superstitious terror through every fiber He
heard the stir of the mouse in the pile of walnuts the hissing
of the flame above the embers and the sudden breaking of the
smoked chimney of the lamp Then as he leaned down he heard
something elsethe steady ticking of the big silver watch in
Fletchers pocket

A horror of great darkness fell over him and turning he reeled
like a drunken man out into the night



CHAPTER IX The Fulfilling of the Law

Christopher had helped Tucker upstairs to bed and had gone into
his own room to undress when a sharp and persistent rattle upon
the closed shutters brought him in alarm to his feet Looking
out he saw a mans figure outlined in the moonlight on the walk
and at once taking it to be Will he ran hastily down and
unbarred the door

Come in quietly he said Uncle Tucker is asleep upstairs
What in thunder is the trouble now

Stepping back he led the way into what so short a time ago had
been Mrs Blakes parlour and then pausing in the center of the
floor stood waiting with knitted brows for an explanation of the
visit But Will who had shrunk dazzled from the flash of the
lamp now lingered to put up the bar with shaking hands

For Gods sake what is it questioned Christopher and a start
shook through him at sight of the others face Have you had a
fit

Closing the parlour door behind him Will crossed the room and
caught at the mantel for support I told you Id do it some
dayI told you Id do it he said incoherently in a frantic
effort to shift the burden of responsibility upon stronger
shoulders

You might have known all along that Id do it some day

Do what demanded Christopher while he felt the current of his
blood grow weak Out with it now Speak up Youre as white as
a sheet

He struck mehe struck me first The bruise is here resumed
Will in the same eager attempt at self justification Then I
hit him on the head with a hammer and his skull gave way I
didnt hit hard I swear it was a little blow but hes dead I
left him stone dead in the kitchen 

My God man exclaimed Christopher and touched him on the
shoulder

With a groan Will put up his hands and covered his bloodshot
eyes I didnt mean to do itI swear I didnt he protested
Whod have thought his head would crush in like that at the
first little blowjust a tap with an old hammer Why it would
hardly have cracked a walnut And what was the hammer doing
there anyway They have no business to leave such things lying
about on the hearth It was all their faultthey ought to have
put the hammer away

A convulsive shudder ran through him ending in his hands and
feet which jerked wildly His face was gray and oldso old that
he might have been taken at the first glance for a man of
eighty and in the intervals between his words he sucked in his
breath with a hissing noise Meeting Christophers look he broke
into a spasm of frightened sobs whimpering like a child that has
been whipped

I told you not to drink again said Christopher sharply as he
struggled to collect his thoughts I told you liquor would make
a beast of you

Ill never touch another drop I swear Ill never touch another
drop groaned Will still sobbing I didnt mean to kill him I
tell you It wasnt as if I really meant to kill him you see
that It was all the fault of that accursed hammer they left
lying on the hearth A man must have a lot of courage to murder
anybodymustnt he he added with a feeble smile and Im a
cowardyou know Ive always been a coward havent Ihavent
I he persisted and Christopher nodded an agreement

You see I wasnt to blame after all but he flew into such a
ragehe always flew into a rage when he heard your name

So you brought my name in asked Christopher carelessly

Oh it was that that did it it was your name replied Will
breathlessly I told him you said he was a devilyou did say
so you know Christopher Blake was right he called you a
devil that was it Then he ran at me with his stick and I
jerked up the hammer and Oh my God they mustnt hang me

Nonsense retorted Christopher roughly for the other had
dropped upon the floor and was grovelling in drunken hysterics at
his feet It makes me sick to see a man act like an ass

Get me out of this and Ill never touch a drop moaned Will
Take me away from herehide me anywhere Ill go anywhere Ill
promise anything only they mustnt find me If they find me Ill
go madIll go mad in gaol

Shut up rejoined Christopher listening with irritation to the
sound of the others hissing breath Stop your infernal racket a
minute and let me think Here get up Are you too drunk to stand
on your feet

Im soberIm perfectly sober protested Will and rising
obediently he stood clutching at the chimneypiece Get me out
of thisonly get me out of this he repeated with a desperate
reliance on the others power to avert the consequences of his
deed Ive always been a good friend to you he went on
passionately The quarrel first started about you and I stood
up for you to the last I never let him say anything against
youI never did

Im much obliged to you returned Christopher and felt that he
might as well have wasted his irony on a beaten hound Turning
away from the wild entreaty of Wills eyes he walked slowly up
and down the room taking care to step lightly lest the boards
should creak and awaken Tucker

The parlour was just as Mrs Blake had left it her highbacked
Elizabethan chair filled with cushions stood on the hearth the
dried grasses in the two tall vases shed their ashy pollen down
upon the bricks Even the yellow cat grown old and sluggish
dozed in her favourite spot beside the embroidered ottoman

On the whitewashed walls the old Blake portraits still presided
and he found for the first time an artless humour in the
formality of the ancestral attitudein the splendid pose which
they had handed down like an heirloom through the centuries
Among them he saw the comely highcoloured features of that
gallant cynic Bolivar the man who had stamped his beauty upon
threegenerations and his gaze lingered with a gentle ridicule on
the blithe candour in the eyes and the characteristic touch of
brutality about the mouth Then he passed to his father portly
impressive a high liver a generous young blood and then to the
classic SaintMemin profile of Aunt Susannah limned delicately
against a background of faded pink And from her he went on to
his mothers portrait painted in shimmering brocade under rose
garlands held by smiling Loves

He looked at them all steadily for a while seeking from the
changeless lips of each an answer to the question which he felt
knocking at his own heart In every limb in every feature in
every fiber he was plainly born to be one of themselves and yet
from their elegant remoteness they stared down upon the rustic
labourer who was their descendant Degraded coarsened
disinherited the last Blake stood before them with his poverty
and ignorance illumined only at long intervals by the flame of a
soul which though darkened was still unquenched

The night dragged slowly on while he paced the floor with his
thoughts and Will moaned and tossed a shivering heap upon the
sofa

Stop your everlasting cackle Christopher had once shouted
angrily forgetting Tucker and for the space of a few minutes
the other had lain silent choking back the strangling sobs But
presently the shattered nerves revolted against restraint and
Will burst out afresh into wild crying The yellow cat grown
suddenly restless crossed the room and jumped upon the sofa
where she stood clawing at the cover and he clung to her with a
pathetic recognition of dumb sympathythe sympathy which he
could not wring from the careless indifference of Christophers
look

Speak to mesay something he pleaded at last stretching out
his hands If this keeps up Ill go mad before morning

At this Christopher came toward him and stopping in his walk
frowned down upon the sofa

You deserve everything youd get he said angrily Youre as
big a fool as ever trod this earth and theres no reason under
heaven why I should lift my hand to help you Theres no reason
theres no reason he repeated in furious tones

But youll do ityoull get me out of it cried Will grasping
the others knees

And two weeks later youd be in another scrape

Not a single dropIll never touch a drop again Before God I
swear it

Pshaw Ive heard that oath before

Strangling a scream Will caught him by the arm dragging himself
slowly into a sitting posture Ill hang myself if you let them
get me he urged hysterically  Ill hang myself in gaol rather
than let them do it I cant face it all I cantI cant It
isnt grandpa I mind Im not afraid of him He was a devil But
its the restthe rest

Roughly shaking him off Christopher left him huddled upon the
floor and resumed his steady walk up and down the room In his
ears the incoherent phrases grew presently fainter and after a
time he lost entirely their frenzied drift A little blowjust
a little blow ended finally in muffled sounds of weeping

The habit of outward composure which always came to him in
moments of swift experience possessed him so perfectly now that
Will lifting miserable eyes to his face lowered them appalled
by its unfeeling gravity

Ive been a good friend to youa deuced good friend to you
urged the younger man in a last passionate appeal for the aid
whose direction he had not yet defined

What is this thought which I cannot get rid of asked
Christopher moodily of himself And what business is it of mine
anyway What am I to the boy or the boy to me But even with the
words he remembered the morning more than five years ago when he
had gone out to the gate with his bird gun on his shoulder and
found Will Fletcher and the spotted foxhound puppies awaiting him
in the road He saw again the boys face with the sunlight full
upon iteager alert a little petulant full of good impulses
readily turned adrift There had been no evil upon it thenonly
weakness and a pathetic absence of determination His own
damnable intention was thrust back upon him and he heard again
the words of Carraway which had reechoed in his thoughts The
way to touch the man then is through the boy So it was the
way after all 

He almost laughed aloud at his prophetic insight He had touched
the man vitally enough at last and it was through the boy He
had murdered Bill Fletcher and he had done it through the only
thing Bill Fletcher had ever loved From this he returned again
to the memory of the deliberate purpose of that dayto the
ribald jests the coarse profanities the brutal oaths Then to
the night when he had forced the first drink down Wills throat
and so on through the five years of his revenge to the present
moment Well his triumph had come at last the summit was put
upon his lifes work and he washe must becontent

Will raised his head and looked at him in reviving hope

Youre the only friend I have on earth he muttered between his
teeth

The first streak of dawn entered suddenly flooding the room with
a thin gray light in which the familiar objects appeared robbed
of all atmospheric values With a last feeble flicker the lamp
shot up and went out and the ashen wash of daybreak seemed the
fit medium for the crude ugliness of life

Towering almost grotesquely in the pallid dawn Christopher came
and leaned above the sofa to which Will had dragged himself
again

You must get out of this he said and quickly for weve
wasted the whole night wrangling Have you any money

Will fumbled in his pocket and brought out a few cents which he
held in his open palm while the other unlocked the drawer of the
old secretary and handed him a roll of banknotes

Take this and buy a ticket somewhere Its the money I scraped
up to pay Fred Turner

To pay Fred Turner echoed Will as if in that lay the
significance of the remark

Take it and buy a ticket and when you get where youre going
sit still and keep your mouth shut If you wear a bold face you
will go scotfree remember that but everything depends upon
your keeping a stiff front And now gothrough the back door and
past the kitchen to the piece of woods beyond the pasture Cut
through them to Tanners Station and take the train there mind
for the North

With a short laugh he held out his big knotted hand

Goodby he said  and dont be a damned fool

Goodby answered Will clinging desperately to his
outstretched arm Then an ashen pallor overspread his face and
he slunk nervously toward the kitchen for there was the sound of
footsteps on the little porch outside followed by a brisk rap on
the front door

Go whispered Christopher hardly taking breath and he stood
waiting while Will ran along the wooden platform and past the
stable toward the pasture

The rap came again and he turned quickly Quit your racket and
let me get on my clothes he shouted and hesitated a little
longer

As he stood alone there in the center of the room his eyes
traversing the walls fell on the portrait of Bolivar Blake and
with one of the fantastic tricks of memory there shot into his
head the dying phrase of that gay sinner I may not sit with the
saints but I shall stand among the gentlemen

Precious old ass he muttered and unbarred the door

As he flung it open the first rays of sunlight splashed across
the threshold and he was conscious all at once of a strange
exhilaration as if he were breasting one of the big waves of
life

This is a pretty way to wake up a fellow who has been planting
tobacco till hes stiff he grumbled Is that you Tom He
glanced carelessly round nodding with a kind of friendly
condescension to each man of the little group How are you
Matthew Hello Fred

Tom drew back coughing and scraped the heel of his boot on the
topmost step

We didnt mean to git you out of bed Mr Christopher he
explained apologetically but the truth is we want Will Fletcher
an he aint at home The old mans murdered suh

Murdered is he exclaimed Christopher with a long whistle
and you want Will Fletcherwhich shows what a very pretty
sheriff you would make Well if youre so strong on his scent
that you cant turn aside most likely youll find him sleeping
off his drunk under my haystack But if youre looking for the
man who killed Bill Fletcher then thats a different matter
he added taking down his hat and I reckon boys Im about
ready to come along



CHAPTER X The Wheel of Life

Throughout the trial he wore the sullen reserve which closed over
him like a visor when he approached one of the crises of life He
had made his confession and he stood to it I killed Bill
Fletcher he gave out flatly enough What he could not give was
an explanation of his unaccountable presence at the Hall so
nearly upon midnight When the question was first put to him he
sneered and shrugged his shoulders with the hereditary gesture of
the Blakes Why was he there Well why wasnt he there That
was all And Carraway who had stood by his side since the day of
the arrest retired at last before an attitude which he
characterised as one of defiant arrogance

It was this attitude people said presently rather than the
murder of Bill Fletcher which brought him the sentence he heard
with so insolent an indifference

Five years wasnt much for killin a man maybe Tom Spade
observed but it was a good deal when you come to think of it
for a Blake to pay jest for gettin even with a Fletcher Why he
might have brained Bill Fletcher an welcome the storekeeper
added a little wistfully if only he hadnt put on such a nasty
manner afterward

But it was behind this impregnable reserve that Christopher
retreated as into a walled fortress There had been no sentiment
in his act he told himself he had not even felt the romantic
fervour of the sacrifice A certain staunch justice was all he
saw in it relieved doubtless by a share of his hereditary love
of desperate hopesof the hotheaded clinging to that last
shifting foothold on which a man might still make his fight
against the power of circumstance And so with that strange
mixture of rustic crudeness and aristocratic arrogance he turned
his face from his friends and went stubbornly through the
crossquestioning of the court

From first to last he had not wavered in his refusal to see
Maria and there had been an angry vehemence in the resistance he
had made to her passionate entreaty for a meeting When by the
early autumn he went from the little town gaol to serve his five
years in the State prison his most vivid memory of her was as
she looked with the moonlight on her face in the open field As
the months went on this gradually grew remote and dim in his
remembrance like a bright star over which the clouds thicken
and his thoughts declined almost without an upward inspiration
upon the brutal level of his daily life Mere physical disgust
was his first violent recoil from what had seemed a curious
deadness of his whole nature and the awakening of the senses
preceded by many months the final resurrection of the more
spiritual emotions The sources of health were still abundant in
him he admitted if the vile air the fetid smells the
closeness as of huddled animals the filth the obscenity the
insufferable bestial humanity could arouse in him a bodily nausea
so nearly resembling disease There were moments when he felt
capable of any crime from sheer frenzied loathing of his
surroundingswhen for the sake of the clean space of the tobacco
fields and the pure water of the little spring he would have
murdered Bill Fletcher a dozen times As for the old mans death
in itself it had never caused him so much as a quiver of the
conscience Bill Fletcher deserved to die and the world was well
rid of himthat was all

But his own misery This was with him always and there was no
escape from the moral wretchedness which seemed to follow so
closely upon crime Fresh from the open country and the keen
winds that blow over level spaces he seemed mentally and
physically to wither in the change of airto shrink slowly to
the perishing root like a plant that has been brought from a
rich meadow to the aridity of the closepacked city And with
the growing of this strange form of homesickness he would be
driven at times into an almost delirious cruelty toward those
who were weaker than himself for there were summer nights when
he would brutally knock smaller men from the single window of the
cell and cling panting for breath to the iron bars As the year
went on his grim silence too became for those around him as
the inevitable shadow of the prison and he went about his daily
work in a churlish loneliness which caused even the convicts
among whom he lived to shrink back from his presence

Then with the closing of the second winter his superb physical
strength snapped suddenly like a cord that has stood too tight a
strain and for weeks he lingered between life and death in the
hospital into which he was carried while yet unconscious With
his returning health when the abatement of the fever left him
strangely shaken and the unearthly pallor still clung to his face
and hands he awoke for the first time to a knowledge that his
illness had altered for the period of his convalescence at least
the vision through which he had grown to regard the world

A change had come to him in that mysterious borderland so near
the grave and the bare places in his soul had burst suddenly
into fulfilment Sitting one Sunday morning in the open court of
the prison with his thin white hands hanging between his knees
and his head cropped now of its thick fair hair raised to the
sunshine it seemed to him that like Tucker on the old bench he
had learned at last how to be happy The warm sun in his face
the blue sky straight overhead the spouting fountain from which
a sparrow drank produced in him a recognition wholly
passionless of the abundant physical beauty of the earthof a
beauty in the blue sky and in the clear sunshine falling upon the
prison court

A month ago he had wondered almost hopefully if his was to be one
of those pathetic sunken graves marked for so brief a time by
wooden headboards the graves of the men who had died within the
wallsand now there pulsed through him sitting there alone a
quiet satisfaction in the thought that he might still breathe the
air and look into mens faces and see the blue sky overhead The
sky in itself That was enough to fill ones memory to
overflowing Tucker had said

A tall lean convict newly released from the hospital crossed
the court at a stumbling pace and stood for a moment at his side

I reckon youre hankerin he remarked I was sent down here
from the mountains an I hanker terrible for the sight of the
old Humpback Knob

And Id like to see a level sweephardly a hill just a clean
stretch for the wind to blow over the tobacco

Youre from the tobaccy belt then aint you What are you here
for

Killing a man And you

Killin two

He limped off at his feeble step and Christopher rubbed his
hands in the warm sunshine and wondered how it would feel to bask
on one of the old logs by the roadside

That afternoon Jim Weatherby came to see him bringing the news
that Lilas baby had come and that she had named it Christopher
Its the living image of you she says he added smiling but
I confess I cant quite see it The funny part is you know that
Cynthia is just as crazy about it as Lila is and she looks ten
years younger since the little chap came

And Uncle Tucker

His old wounds trouble him but he sent you word he was waiting
to go till you came back again

A blur swam before Christophers eyes and he saw in fancy the
old soldier waiting for him on the bench beside the damask
rosebush

And the othersand Maria Wyndham he asked swallowing the
lump in his throat

Jim reached out and laid his hand on the broad stripes across the
others shoulder

She was with Mr Tucker when he said that he replied they
are always together now and she added Tell him we shall wait
together till he comes

The tears which had blinded Christophers eyes fell down upon his
clasped hands

My God Let me live to go back he cried out in his weakness

From this time the element of hope entered into his life and
like its shadow there came the brooding fear that he should not
live to see the year of his release With his declining health he
had been given lighter work in the prison factory but the small
tasks seemed to him heavier than the large ones he remembered
There was no disease the physician in the hospital assured him
it was only his unusual form of homesickness feeding upon his
weakened frame Let him return once more to the outdoor life and
the fresh air of the tobacco fields and within six months his old
physical hardihood would revive

It was noticeable at this time that the quiet tolerance which had
grown upon him in his convalescence drew to him the sympathy
which he had at first repulsed The interest awakened in the
beginning by some rare force of attraction in his mere bodily
presence became now when he had fallen away to what seemed the
shadow of himself a friendly and almost affectionate curiosity
concerning his earlier history With this there grew slowly a
rough companionship between him and the men among whom he lived
and he found presently to his surprise that there was hardly one
of them but had some soft spot in his charactersome particular
virtue which was still alive The knowledge of good and evil
thrust upon him in these months was not without effect in
developing a certain largeness of outlook upon humanitya kind
of generous philosophy which remained with him afterward in the
form of a peculiar mellowness of temperament

The autumn of his third year was already closing when being sent
for one morning from the office of the superintendent he went in
to find Cynthia awaiting him with his pardon in her hand Ive
come for you Christopher she said weeping at sight of his
wasted figure The whole county has been working to get you out
and you are free at last

Free at last he repeated mechanically and was conscious of a
disappointment in the fact that he experienced no elation with
the words What was this freedom that had meant so much to him a
month ago

Somebody in Europe wrote back to Maria she added while her
dry sobs rattled in her bosom that the boy had confessed it to
a priest who made him write it home Oh Christopher
Christopher I cant understand

No you cant understand returned Christopher shaking his
head They would not understand he knew none of themneither
the world nor Cynthia nor his mother who was dead nor Maria
who was living They would not understand and even to himself
the mystery was still unsolved He had acted according to the law
of his own nature this was all that was clear to him and the
destiny of character had controlled him from the beginning The
wheel had turned and he with it and being as blind as fate
itself he could see nothing further

Back once more in the familiar country fresh from the strong
grasp of friendly hands and driving at sunset along the red road
beneath halfbared honeylocusts he was conscious with a dull
throb of regret that the placid contentment he felt creeping
over him failed in emotional resemblance to the happiness he had
associated with his return Had the sap really gone dry within
him and would he go on forever with this curious numbness at his
heart

Maria wanted you to go straight to the Hall said Cynthia
turning suddenly but I told her Id better take you home and
put you to bed at once It was she who went to the Governor and
got your pardon she added after a moment but when I begged
her to come with me to take it to you she would not do it She
would not see you until you were back in your own place she
said

He smiled faintly and leaning back among the rugs Cynthia had
brought watched the white mist creeping over the ploughed
fields The thought of Maria no longer stirred his pulses and
when presently they reached the whitewashed cottage and he sat
with Tucker before the wood fire in his mothers parlour he
found himself gazing with a dull impersonal curiosity at the
portraits smiling so coldly down upon the hearth The memory of
his mother left him as immovable as did the many trivial
associations which thronged through his brain at sight of the
room which had been hers A little later lying in her tester
bed the fall of the acorns on the shingled roof above sent him
into a profound and untroubled sleep

With the first sunlight he awoke and noiselessly slipping into
his clothes went out for a daylight view of the country which
had dwelt for so long a happy vision in his thoughts The dew was
thick on the grass and crossing to the old bench he sat down
in the pale sunshine beside the damask rosebush on which a
single flower blossomed out of season Beyond the cedars in the
graveyard the sunrise flamed golden upon a violet background and
across the field of lifeeverlasting there ran a sparkling path of
fire The air was strong with autumn scents and as he drank it
in with deep drafts it seemed to him that he began to breathe
anew the spirit of life With a single bound of the heart the
sense of freedom came to him and with it the happiness that he
had missed the evening before pulsed through his veins Much yet
remained to himthe earth with its untold miracles the sky with
its infinity of space his own souland Maria

With her name he sprang to his feet in the ardour of his
impatience and it was then that looking up he saw her coming
to him across the sunbeams
