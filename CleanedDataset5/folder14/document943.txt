MISALLIANCE


_Johnny Tarleton an ordinary young business man of thirty or less is
taking his weekly Friday to Tuesday in the house of his father John
Tarleton who has made a great deal of money out of Tarletons
Underwear The house is in Surrey on the slope of Hindhead and
Johnny reclining novel in hand in a swinging chair with a little
awning above it is enshrined in a spacious half hemisphere of glass
which forms a pavilion commanding the garden and beyond it a barren
but lovely landscape of hill profile with fir trees commons of
bracken and gorse and wonderful cloud pictures_

_The glass pavilion springs from a bridgelike arch in the wall of the
house through which one comes into a big hall with tiled flooring
which suggests that the proprietors notion of domestic luxury is
founded on the lounges of weekend hotels The arch is not quite in
the centre of the wall There is more wall to its right than to its
left and this space is occupied by a hat rack and umbrella stand in
which tennis rackets white parasols caps Panama hats and other
summery articles are bestowed Just through the arch at this corner
stands a new portable Turkish bath recently unpacked with its crate
beside it and on the crate the drawn nails and the hammer used in
unpacking Near the crate are open boxes of garden games bowls and
croquet Nearly in the middle of the glass wall of the pavilion is a
door giving on the garden with a couple of steps to surmount the
hotwater pipes which skirt the glass At intervals round the
pavilion are marble pillars with specimens of Viennese pottery on
them very flamboyant in colour and florid in design Between them
are folded garden chairs flung anyhow against the pipes In the side
walls are two doors one near the hat stand leading to the interior
of the house the other on the opposite side and at the other end
leading to the vestibule_

_There is no solid furniture except a sideboard which stands against
the wall between the vestibule door and the pavilion a small writing
table with a blotter a rack for telegram forms and stationery and a
wastepaper basket standing out in the hall near the sideboard and a
ladys worktable with two chairs at it towards the other side of the
lounge The writing table has also two chairs at it On the
sideboard there is a tantalus liqueur bottles a syphon a glass jug
of lemonade tumblers and every convenience for casual drinking
Also a plate of sponge cakes and a highly ornate punchbowl in the
same style as the keramic display in the pavilion Wicker chairs and
little bamboo tables with ash trays and boxes of matches on them are
scattered in all directions In the pavilion which is flooded with
sunshine is the elaborate patent swing seat and awning in which
Johnny reclines with his novel There are two wicker chairs right and
left of him_

_Bentley Summerhays one of those smallish thinskinned youths who
from 17 to 70 retain unaltered the mental airs of the later and the
physical appearance of the earlier age appears in the garden and
comes through the glass door into the pavilion He is unmistakably a
grade above Johnny socially and though he looks sensitive enough his
assurance and his high voice are a little exasperating_

JOHNNY Hallo Wheres your luggage

BENTLEY I left it at the station Ive walked up from Haslemere
_He goes to the hat stand and hangs up his hat_

JOHNNY _shortly_ Oh And whos to fetch it

BENTLEY Dont know Dont care Providence probably If not your
mother will have it fetched

JOHNNY Not her business exactly is it

BENTLEY _returning to the pavilion_ Of course not Thats why one
loves her for doing it Look here chuck away your silly weekend
novel and talk to a chap After a week in that filthy office my
brain is simply bluemouldy Lets argue about something intellectual
_He throws himself into the wicker chair on Johnnys right_

JOHNNY _straightening up in the swing with a yell of protest_ No
Now seriously Bunny Ive come down here to have a pleasant weekend
and Im not going to stand your confounded arguments If you want to
argue get out of this and go over to the Congregationalist
ministers Hes a nailer at arguing He likes it

BENTLEY You cant argue with a person when his livelihood depends on
his not letting you convert him And would you mind not calling me
Bunny My name is Bentley Summerhays which you please

JOHNNY Whats the matter with Bunny

BENTLEY It puts me in a false position Have you ever considered
the fact that I was an afterthought

JOHNNY An afterthought What do you mean by that

BENTLEY I

JOHNNY No stop I dont want to know Its only a dodge to start
an argument

BENTLEY Dont be afraid it wont overtax your brain My father was
44 when I was born My mother was 41 There was twelve years between
me and the next eldest I was unexpected I was probably
unintentional My brothers and sisters are not the least like me
Theyre the regular thing that you always get in the first batch from
young parents quite pleasant ordinary dotheregularthing sort
all body and no brains like you

JOHNNY Thank you

BENTLEY Dont mention it old chap Now Im different By the time
I was born the old couple knew something So I came out all brains
and no more body than is absolutely necessary I am really a good
deal older than you though you were born ten years sooner Everybody
feels that when they hear us talk consequently though its quite
natural to hear me calling you Johnny it sounds ridiculous and
unbecoming for you to call me Bunny _He rises_

JOHNNY Does it by George You stop me doing it if you can thats
all

BENTLEY If you go on doing it after Ive asked you not youll feel an
awful swine _He strolls away carelessly to the sideboard with his
eye on the sponge cakes_ At least I should but I suppose youre not
so particular

JOHNNY _rising vengefully and following Bentley who is forced to
turn and listen_ Ill tell you what it is my boy you want a good
talking to and Im going to give it to you If you think that
because your fathers a KCB and you want to marry my sister you
can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like youre
mistaken Let me tell you that except Hypatia not one person in this
house is in favor of her marrying you and I dont believe shes happy
about it herself The match isnt settled yet dont forget that
Youre on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his
daughter money for an idle man to live on her Youre on trial here
because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the
house before she marries him Thats been going on for two months now
and whats the result Youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the
office and youre getting yourself thoroughly disliked here all
through your bad manners and your conceit and the damned impudence
you think clever

BENTLEY _deeply wounded and trying hard to control himself_ Thats
enough thank you You dont suppose I hope that I should have come
down if I had known that that was how you felt about me _He makes
for the vestibule door_

JOHNNY _collaring him_ No you dont run away Im going to
have this out with you Sit down dy hear _Bentley attempts to
go with dignity Johnny slings him into a chair at the writing table
where he sits bitterly humiliated but afraid to speak lest he should
burst into tears_ Thats the advantage of having more body than
brains you see it enables me to teach you manners and Im going to
do it too Youre a spoilt young pup and you need a jolly good
licking And if youre not careful youll get it Ill see to that
next time you call me a swine

BENTLEY I didnt call you a swine But _bursting into a fury of
tears_ you are a swine youre a beast youre a brute youre a
cad youre a liar youre a bully I should like to wring your
damned neck for you

JOHNNY _with a derisive laugh_ Try it my son _Bentley gives
an inarticulate sob of rage_ Fighting isnt in your line Youre too
small and youre too childish I always suspected that your cleverness
wouldnt come to very much when it was brought up against something
solid some decent chaps fist for instance

BENTLEY I hope your beastly fist may come up against a mad bull or a
prizefighters nose or something solider than me I dont care about
your fist but if everybody here dislikes me _he is checked by a
sob_ Well I dont care _Trying to recover himself_ Im sorry I
intruded I didnt know _Breaking down again_ Oh you beast you
pig Swine swine swine swine swine Now

JOHNNY All right my lad all right Sling your mud as hard as you
please it wont stick to me What I want to know is this How is it
that your father who I suppose is the strongest man England has
produced in our time

BENTLEY You got that out of your halfpenny paper A lot you know
about him

JOHNNY I dont set up to be able to do anything but admire him and
appreciate him and be proud of him as an Englishman If it wasnt for
my respect for him I wouldnt have stood your cheek for two days let
alone two months But what I cant understand is why he didnt lick it
out of you when you were a kid For twentyfive years he kept a place
twice as big as England in order a place full of seditious
coffeecolored heathens and pestilential white agitators in the middle
of a lot of savage tribes And yet he couldnt keep you in order I
dont set up to be half the man your father undoubtedly is but by
George its lucky for you you were not my son I dont hold with my
own fathers views about corporal punishment being wrong Its
necessary for some people and Id have tried it on you until you
first learnt to howl and then to behave yourself

BENTLEY _contemptuously_ Yes behavior wouldnt come naturally to
your son would it

JOHNNY _stung into sudden violence_ Now you keep a civil tongue
in your head Ill stand none of your snobbery Im just as proud of
Tarletons Underwear as you are of your fathers title and his KCB
and all the rest of it My father began in a little hole of a shop in
Leeds no bigger than our pantry down the passage there He

BENTLEY Oh yes I know Ive read it The Romance of Business or
The Story of Tarletons Underwear Please Take One I took one the
day after I first met Hypatia I went and bought half a dozen
unshrinkable vests for her sake

JOHNNY Well did they shrink

BENTLEY Oh dont be a fool

JOHNNY Never mind whether Im a fool or not Did they shrink
Thats the point Were they worth the money

BENTLEY I couldnt wear them do you think my skins as thick as
your customers hides Id as soon have dressed myself in a nutmeg
grater

JOHNNY Pity your father didnt give your thin skin a jolly good
lacing with a cane

BENTLEY Pity you havnt got more than one idea If you want to know
they did try that on me once when I was a small kid A silly
governess did it I yelled fit to bring down the house and went into
convulsions and brain fever and that sort of thing for three weeks
So the old girl got the sack and serve her right After that I was
let do what I like My father didnt want me to grow up a
brokenspirited spaniel which is your idea of a man I suppose

JOHNNY Jolly good thing for you that my father made you come into
the office and shew what you were made of And it didnt come to much
let me tell you that When the Governor asked me where I thought we
ought to put you I said Make him the Office Boy The Governor
said you were too green And so you were

BENTLEY I daresay So would you be pretty green if you were shoved
into my fathers set I picked up your silly business in a fortnight
Youve been at it ten years and you havnt picked it up yet

JOHNNY Dont talk rot child You know you simply make me pity you

BENTLEY Romance of Business indeed The real romance of
Tarletons business is the story that you understand anything about
it You never could explain any mortal thing about it to me when I
asked you See what was done the last time that was the beginning
and the end of your wisdom Youre nothing but a turnspit

JOHNNY A what

BENTLEY A turnspit If your father hadnt made a roasting jack for
you to turn youd be earning twentyfour shillings a week behind a
counter

JOHNNY If you dont take that back and apologize for your bad
manners Ill give you as good a hiding as ever

BENTLEY Help Johnnys beating me Oh Murder _He throws
himself on the ground uttering piercing yells_

JOHNNY Dont be a fool Stop that noise will you Im not going to
touch you Shsh

_Hypatia rushes in through the inner door followed by Mrs Tarleton
and throws herself on her knees by Bentley Mrs Tarleton whose knees
are stiffer bends over him and tries to lift him Mrs Tarleton is a
shrewd and motherly old lady who has been pretty in her time and is
still very pleasant and likeable and unaffected Hypatia is a typical
English girl of a sort never called typical that is she has an
opaque white skin black hair large dark eyes with black brows and
lashes curved lips swift glances and movements that flash out of a
waiting stillness boundless energy and audacity held in leash_

HYPATIA _pouncing on Bentley with no very gentle hand_ Bentley
whats the matter Dont cry like that whats the use Whats
happened

MRS TARLETON Are you ill child _They get him up_ There there
pet Its all right dont cry _they put him into a chair_ there
there there Johnny will go for the doctor and hell give you
something nice to make it well

HYPATIA What has happened Johnny

MRS TARLETON Was it a wasp

BENTLEY _impatiently_ Wasp be dashed

MRS TARLETON Oh Bunny that was a naughty word

BENTLEY Yes I know I beg your pardon _He rises and extricates
himself from them_ Thats all right Johnny frightened me You know
how easy it is to hurt me and Im too small to defend myself against
Johnny

MRS TARLETON Johnny how often have I told you that you must not
bully the little ones I thought youd outgrown all that

HYPATIA _angrily_ I do declare mamma that Johnnys brutality
makes it impossible to live in the house with him

JOHNNY _deeply hurt_ Its twentyseven years mother since you
had that row with me for licking Robert and giving Hypatia a black eye
because she bit me I promised you then that Id never raise my hand
to one of them again and Ive never broken my word And now because
this young whelp begins to cry out before hes hurt you treat me as
if I were a brute and a savage

MRS TARLETON No dear not a savage but you know you must not call
our visitor naughty names

BENTLEY Oh let him alone

JOHNNY _fiercely_ Dont you interfere between my mother and me
dy hear

HYPATIA Johnnys lost his temper mother Wed better go Come
Bentley

MRS TARLETON Yes that will be best _To Bentley_ Johnny doesnt
mean any harm dear hell be himself presently Come

_The two ladies go out through the inner door with Bentley who turns
at the door to grin at Johnny as he goes out_

_Johnny left alone clenches his fists and grinds his teeth but can
find no relief in that way for his rage After choking and stamping
for a moment he makes for the vestibule door It opens before he
reaches it and Lord Summerhays comes in Johnny glares at him
speechless Lord Summerhays takes in the situation and quickly takes
the punchbowl from the sideboard and offers it to Johnny_

LORD SUMMERHAYS Smash it Dont hesitate its an ugly thing
Smash it hard _Johnny with a stifled yell dashes it in pieces
and then sits down and mops his brow_ Feel better now _Johnny
nods_ I know only one person alive who could drive me to the point
of having either to break china or commit murder and that person is
my son Bentley Was it he _Johnny nods again not yet able to
speak_ As the car stopped I heard a yell which is only too familiar
to me It generally means that some infuriated person is trying to
thrash Bentley Nobody has ever succeeded though almost everybody
has tried _He seats himself comfortably close to the writing table
and sets to work to collect the fragments of the punchbowl in the
wastepaper basket whilst Johnny with diminishing difficulty collects
himself_ Bentley is a problem which I confess I have never been
able to solve He was born to be a great success at the age of fifty
Most Englishmen of his class seem to be born to be great successes at
the age of twentyfour at most The domestic problem for me is how to
endure Bentley until he is fifty The problem for the nation is how
to get itself governed by men whose growth is arrested when they are
little more than college lads Bentley doesnt really mean to be
offensive You can always make him cry by telling him you dont like
him Only he cries so loud that the experiment should be made in the
open air in the middle of Salisbury Plain if possible He has a
hard and penetrating intellect and a remarkable power of looking facts
in the face but unfortunately being very young he has no idea of
how very little of that sort of thing most of us can stand On the
other hand he is frightfully sensitive and even affectionate so that
he probably gets as much as he gives in the way of hurt feelings
Youll excuse me rambling on like this about my son

JOHNNY _who has pulled himself together_ You did it on purpose
I wasnt quite myself I needed a moment to pull round thank you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Not at all Is your father at home

JOHNNY No hes opening one of his free libraries Thats another
nice little penny gone Hes mad on reading He promised another
free library last week Its ruinous Itll hit you as well as me
when Bunny marries Hypatia When all Hypatias money is thrown away
on libraries where will Bunny come in Cant you stop him

LORD SUMMERHAYS Im afraid not Hes a perfect whirlwind
Indefatigable at public work Wonderful man I think

JOHNNY Oh public work He does too much of it Its really a sort
of laziness getting away from your own serious business to amuse
yourself with other peoples Mind I dont say there isnt another
side to it It has its value as an advertisement It makes useful
acquaintances and leads to valuable business connections But it
takes his mind off the main chance and he overdoes it

LORD SUMMERHAYS The danger of public business is that it never ends
A man may kill himself at it

JOHNNY Or he can spend more on it than it brings him in thats how
I look at it What I say is that everybodys business is nobodys
business I hope Im not a hard man nor a narrow man nor unwilling
to pay reasonable taxes and subscribe in reason to deserving
charities and even serve on a jury in my turn and no man can say I
ever refused to help a friend out of a difficulty when he was worth
helping But when you ask me to go beyond that I tell you frankly I
dont see it I never did see it even when I was only a boy and had
to pretend to take in all the ideas the Governor fed me up with I
didnt see it and I dont see it

LORD SUMMERHAYS There is certainly no business reason why you should
take more than your share of the worlds work

JOHNNY So I say Its really a great encouragement to me to find
you agree with me For of course if nobody agrees with you how are
you to know that youre not a fool

LORD SUMMERHAYS Quite so

JOHNNY I wish youd talk to him about it Its no use my saying
anything Im a child to him still I have no influence Besides
you know how to handle men See how you handled me when I was making
a fool of myself about Bunny

LORD SUMMERHAYS Not at all

JOHNNY Oh yes I was I know I was Well if my blessed father had
come in hed have told me to control myself As if I was losing my
temper on purpose

_Bentley returns newly washed He beams when he sees his father and
comes affectionately behind him and pats him on the shoulders_

BENTLEY Hello commander have you come Ive been making a filthy
silly ass of myself here Im awfully sorry Johnny old chap I beg
your pardon Why dont you kick me when I go on like that

LORD SUMMERHAYS As we came through Godalming I thought I heard some
yelling

BENTLEY I should think you did Johnny was rather rough on me
though He told me nobody here liked me and I was silly enough to
believe him

LORD SUMMERHAYS And all the women have been kissing you and pitying
you ever since to stop your crying I suppose Baby

BENTLEY I did cry But I always feel good after crying it
relieves my wretched nerves I feel perfectly jolly now

LORD SUMMERHAYS Not at all ashamed of yourself for instance

BENTLEY If I started being ashamed of myself I shouldnt have time
for anything else all my life I say I feel very fit and spry
Lets all go down and meet the Grand Cham _He goes to the hatstand
and takes down his hat_

LORD SUMMERHAYS Does Mr Tarleton like to be called the Grand Cham
do you think Bentley

BENTLEY Well he thinks hes too modest for it He calls himself
Plain John But you cant call him that in his own office besides
it doesnt suit him its not flamboyant enough

JOHNNY Flam what

BENTLEY Flamboyant Lets go and meet him Hes telephoned from
Guildford to say hes on the road The dear old son is always
telephoning or telegraphing he thinks hes hustling along like
anything when hes only sending unnecessary messages

LORD SUMMERHAYS Thank you I should prefer a quiet afternoon

BENTLEY Right O I shant press Johnny hes had enough of me for
one weekend _He goes out through the pavilion into the grounds_

JOHNNY Not a bad idea that

LORD SUMMERHAYS What

JOHNNY Going to meet the Governor You know you wouldnt think it
but the Governor likes Bunny rather And Bunny is cultivating it I
shouldnt be surprised if he thought he could squeeze me out one of
these days

LORD SUMMERHAYS You dont say so Young rascal I want to consult
you about him if you dont mind Shall we stroll over to the Gibbet
Bentley is too fast for me as a walking companion but I should like a
short turn

JOHNNY _rising eagerly highly flattered_ Right you are Thatll
suit me down to the ground _He takes a Panama and stick from the
hat stand_

_Mrs Tarleton and Hypatia come back just as the two men are going out
Hypatia salutes Summerhays from a distance with an enigmatic lift of
her eyelids in his direction and a demure nod before she sits down at
the worktable and busies herself with her needle Mrs Tarleton
hospitably fussy goes over to him_

MRS TARLETON Oh Lord Summerhays I didnt know you were here Wont
you have some tea

LORD SUMMERHAYS No thank you Im not allowed tea And Im
ashamed to say Ive knocked over your beautiful punchbowl You must
let me replace it

MRS TARLETON Oh it doesnt matter Im only too glad to be rid of
it The shopman told me it was in the best taste but when my poor
old nurse Martha got cataract Bunny said it was a merciful provision
of Nature to prevent her seeing our china

LORD SUMMERHAYS _gravely_ That was exceedingly rude of Bentley
Mrs Tarleton I hope you told him so

MRS TARLETON Oh bless you I dont care what he says so long as he
says it to me and not before visitors

JOHNNY Were going out for a stroll mother

MRS TARLETON All right dont let us keep you Never mind about
that crock Ill get the girl to come and take the pieces away
_Recollecting herself_ There Ive done it again

JOHNNY Done what

MRS TARLETON Called her the girl You know Lord Summerhays its a
funny thing but now Im getting old Im dropping back into all the
ways John and I had when we had barely a hundred a year You should
have known me when I was forty I talked like a duchess and if
Johnny or Hypatia let slip a word that was like old times I was down
on them like anything And now Im beginning to do it myself at every
turn

LORD SUMMERHAYS There comes a time when all that seems to matter so
little Even queens drop the mask when they reach our time of life

MRS TARLETON Let you alone for giving a thing a pretty turn Youre
a humbug you know Lord Summerhays John doesnt know it and Johnny
doesnt know it but you and I know it dont we Now thats something
that even you cant answer so be off with you for your walk without
another word

_Lord Summerhays smiles bows and goes out through the vestibule
door followed by Johnny Mrs Tarleton sits down at the worktable and
takes out her darning materials and one of her husbands socks
Hypatia is at the other side of the table on her mothers right
They chat as they work_

HYPATIA I wonder whether they laugh at us when they are by
themselves

MRS TARLETON Who

HYPATIA Bentley and his father and all the toffs in their set

MRS TARLETON Oh thats only their way I used to think that the
aristocracy were a nasty sneering lot and that they were laughing at
me and John Theyre always giggling and pretending not to care much
about anything But you get used to it theyre the same to one
another and to everybody Besides what does it matter what they
think Its far worse when theyre civil because that always means
that they want you to lend them money and you must never do that
Hypatia because they never pay How can they They dont make
anything you see Of course if you can make up your mind to regard
it as a gift thats different but then they generally ask you again
and you may as well say no first as last You neednt be afraid of the
aristocracy dear theyre only human creatures like ourselves after
all and youll hold your own with them easy enough

HYPATIA Oh Im not a bit afraid of them I assure you

MRS TARLETON Well no not afraid of them exactly but youve got to
pick up their ways You know dear I never quite agreed with your
fathers notion of keeping clear of them and sending you to a school
that was so expensive that they couldnt afford to send their daughters
there so that all the girls belonged to big business families like
ourselves It takes all sorts to make a world and I wanted you to
see a little of all sorts When you marry Bunny and go among the
women of his fathers set theyll shock you at first

HYPATIA _incredulously_ How

MRS TARLETON Well the things they talk about

HYPATIA Oh scandalmongering

MRS TARLETON Oh no we all do that thats only human nature But
you know theyve no notion of decency I shall never forget the first
day I spent with a marchioness two duchesses and no end of Ladies
This and That Of course it was only a committee theyd put me on to
get a big subscription out of John Id never heard such talk in my
life The things they mentioned And it was the marchioness that
started it

HYPATIA What sort of things

MRS TARLETON Drainage Shed tried three systems in her castle
and she was going to do away with them all and try another I didnt
know which way to look when she began talking about it I thought
theyd all have got up and gone out of the room But not a bit of it
if you please They were all just as bad as she They all had
systems and each of them swore by her own system I sat there with
my cheeks burning until one of the duchesses thinking I looked out of
it I suppose asked me what system I had I said I was sure I knew
nothing about such things and hadnt we better change the subject
Then the fat was in the fire I can tell you There was a regular
terror of a countess with an anaerobic system and she told me
downright brutally that Id better learn something about them before
my children died of diphtheria That was just two months after Id
buried poor little Bobby and that was the very thing he died of poor
little lamb I burst out crying I couldnt help it It was as good
as telling me Id killed my own child I had to go away but before I
was out of the door one of the duchessesquite a young womanbegan
talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to
live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly And me listening
to her that had never dared to think that a duchess could have
anything so common as an inside I shouldnt have minded if it had
been childrens insides we have to talk about them But grownup
people I was glad to get away that time

HYPATIA There was a physiology and hygiene class started at school
but of course none of our girls were let attend it

MRS TARLETON If it had been an aristocratic school plenty would have
attended it Thats what theyre like theyve nasty minds With
really nice good women a thing is either decent or indecent and if
its indecent we just dont mention it or pretend to know about it
and theres an end of it But all the aristocracy cares about is
whether it can get any good out of the thing Theyre what Johnny
calls cynicallike And of course nobody can say a word to them for
it Theyre so high up that they can do and say what they like

HYPATIA Well I think they might leave the drains to their husbands
I shouldnt think much of a man that left such things to me

MRS TARLETON Oh dont think that dear whatever you do I never
let on about it to you but its me that takes care of the drainage
here After what that countess said to me I wasnt going to lose
another child or trust John And I dont want my grandchildren to die
any more than my children

HYPATIA Do you think Bentley will ever be as big a man as his
father I dont mean clever I mean big and strong

MRS TARLETON Not he Hes overbred like one of those expensive
little dogs I like a bit of a mongrel myself whether its a man or
a dog theyre the best for everyday But we all have our tastes
whats one womans meat is another womans poison Bunnys a dear
little fellow but I never could have fancied him for a husband when I
was your age

HYPATIA Yes but he has some brains Hes not like all the rest
One cant have everything

MRS TARLETON Oh youre quite right dear quite right Its a
great thing to have brains look what its done for your father
Thats the reason I never said a word when you jilted poor Jerry
Mackintosh

HYPATIA _excusing herself_ I really couldnt stick it out with
Jerry mother I know you liked him and nobody can deny that hes a
splendid animal

MRS TARLETON _shocked_ Hypatia How can you The things that
girls say nowadays

HYPATIA Well what else can you call him If Id been deaf or hed
been dumb I could have married him But living with father Ive got
accustomed to cleverness Jerry would drive me mad you know very
well hes a fool even Johnny thinks him a fool

MRS TARLETON _up in arms at once in defence of her boy_ Now dont
begin about my Johnny You know it annoys me Johnnys as clever as
anybody else in his own way I dont say hes as clever as you in some
ways but hes a man at all events and not a little squit of a thing
like your Bunny

HYPATIA Oh I say nothing against your darling we all know
Johnnys perfection

MRS TARLETON Dont be cross dearie You let Johnny alone and Ill
let Bunny alone Im just as bad as you There

HYPATIA Oh I dont mind your saying that about Bentley Its true
He is a little squit of a thing I wish he wasnt But who else is
there Think of all the other chances Ive had Not one of them has
as much brains in his whole body as Bentley has in his little finger
Besides theyve no distinction Its as much as I can do to tell one
from the other They wouldnt even have money if they werent the sons
of their fathers like Johnny Whats a girl to do I never met
anybody like Bentley before He may be small but hes the best of the
bunch you cant deny that

MRS TARLETON _with a sigh_ Well my pet if you fancy him theres
no more to be said

_A pause follows this remark the two women sewing silently_

HYPATIA Mother do you think marriage is as much a question of
fancy as it used to be in your time and fathers

MRS TARLETON Oh it wasnt much fancy with me dear your father
just wouldnt take no for an answer and I was only too glad to be his
wife instead of his shopgirl Still its curious but I had more
choice than you in a way because you see I was poor and there are
so many more poor men than rich ones that I might have had more of a
pick as you might say if John hadnt suited me

HYPATIA I can imagine all sorts of men I could fall in love with
but I never seem to meet them The real ones are too small like
Bunny or too silly like Jerry Of course one can get into a state
about any man fall in love with him if you like to call it that
But who would risk marrying a man for love _I_ shouldnt I remember
three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never
marry was the man you were in love with because it would make a
perfect slave of you Theres a sort of instinct against it I think
thats just as strong as the other instinct One of them to my
certain knowledge refused a man she was in love with and married
another who was in love with her and it turned out very well

MRS TARLETON Does all that mean that youre not in love with Bunny

HYPATIA Oh how could anybody be in love with Bunny I like him to
kiss me just as I like a baby to kiss me Im fond of him and he
never bores me and I see that hes very clever but Im not what you
call gone about him if thats what you mean

MRS TARLETON Then why need you marry him

HYPATIA What better can I do I must marry somebody I suppose
Ive realized that since I was twentythree I always used to take it
as a matter of course that I should be married before I was twenty

BENTLEYS VOICE _in the garden_ Youve got to keep yourself fresh
to look at these things with an open mind

JOHN TARLETONS VOICE Quite right quite right I always say so

MRS TARLETON Theres your father and Bunny with him

BENTLEY Keep young Keep your eye on me Thats the tip for you

_Bentley and Mr Tarleton an immense and genial veteran of trade come
into view and enter the pavilion_

JOHN TARLETON You think youre young do you You think Im old
_energetically shaking off his motoring coat and hanging it up with
his cap_

BENTLEY _helping him with the coat_ Of course youre old Look at
your face and look at mine What you call your youth is nothing but
your levity Why do we get on so well together Because Im a young
cub and youre an old josser _He throws a cushion at Hypatias feet
and sits down on it with his back against her knees_

TARLETON Old Thats all you know about it my lad How do Patsy
_Hypatia kisses him_ How is my Chickabiddy _He kisses Mrs
Tarletons hand and poses expansively in the middle of the picture_
Look at me Look at these wrinkles these gray hairs this repulsive
mask that you call old age What is it _Vehemently_ I ask you
what is it

BENTLEY Jolly nice and venerable old man Dont be discouraged

TARLETON Nice Not a bit of it Venerable Venerable be blowed
Read your Darwin my boy Read your Weismann _He goes to the
sideboard for a drink of lemonade_

MRS TARLETON For shame John Tell him to read his Bible

TARLETON _manipulating the syphon_ Whats the use of telling
children to read the Bible when you know they wont I was kept away
from the Bible for forty years by being told to read it when I was
young Then I picked it up one evening in a hotel in Sunderland when
I had left all my papers in the train and I found it wasnt half bad
_He drinks and puts down the glass with a smack of enjoyment_
Better than most halfpenny papers anyhow if only you could make
people believe it _He sits down by the writingtable near his
wife_ But if you want to understand old age scientifically read
Darwin and Weismann Of course if you want to understand it
romantically read about Solomon

MRS TARLETON Have you had tea John

TARLETON Yes Dont interrupt me when Im improving the boys mind
Where was I This repulsive maskYes _Explosively_ What is
death

MRS TARLETON John

HYPATIA Death is a rather unpleasant subject papa

TARLETON Not a bit Not scientifically Scientifically its a
delightful subject You think deaths natural Well it isnt You
read Weismann There wasnt any death to start with You go look in
any ditch outside and youll find swimming about there as fresh as
paint some of the identical little live cells that Adam christened in
the Garden of Eden But if big things like us didnt die wed crowd
one another off the face of the globe Nothing survived sir except
the sort of people that had the sense and good manners to die and make
room for the fresh supplies And so death was introduced by Natural
Selection You get it out of your head my lad that Im going to die
because Im wearing out or decaying Theres no such thing as decay to
a vital man I shall clear out but I shant decay

BENTLEY And what about the wrinkles and the almond tree and the
grasshopper that becomes a burden and the desire that fails

TARLETON Does it by George No sir it spiritualizes As to
your grasshopper I can carry an elephant

MRS TARLETON You do say such things Bunny What does he mean by
the almond tree

TARLETON He means my white hairs the repulsive mask That my
boy is another invention of Natural Selection to disgust young women
with me and give the lads a turn

MRS TARLETON John I wont have it Thats a forbidden subject

TARLETON They talk of the wickedness and vanity of women painting
their faces and wearing auburn wigs at fifty But why shouldnt they
Why should a woman allow Nature to put a false mask of age on her when
she knows that shes as young as ever Why should she look in the
glass and see a wrinkled lie when a touch of fine art will shew her a
glorious truth The wrinkles are a dodge to repel young men Suppose
she doesnt want to repel young men Suppose she likes them

MRS TARLETON Bunny take Hypatia out into the grounds for a walk
theres a good boy John has got one of his naughty fits this evening

HYPATIA Oh never mind me Im used to him

BENTLEY Im not I never heard such conversation I cant believe
my ears And mind you this is the man who objected to my marrying
his daughter on the ground that a marriage between a member of the
great and good middle class with one of the vicious and corrupt
aristocracy would be a misalliance A misalliance if you please
This is the man Ive adopted as a father

TARLETON Eh Whats that Adopted me as a father have you

BENTLEY Yes Thats an idea of mine I knew a chap named Joey
Percival at Oxford you know I was two months at Balliol before I was
sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college
what I jolly well thought of him He would have been glad to have me
back too at the end of six months but I wouldnt go I just let him
want and serve him right Well Joey was a most awfully clever
fellow and so nice I asked him what made such a difference between
him and all the other pupsthey were pups if you like He told me
it was very simple they had only one father apiece and he had
three

MRS TARLETON Dont talk nonsense child How could that be

BENTLEY Oh very simple His father

TARLETON Which father

BENTLEY The first one the regulation natural chap He kept a tame
philosopher in the house a sort of Coleridge or Herbert Spencer kind
of card you know That was the second father Then his mother was
an Italian princess and she had an Italian priest always about He
was supposed to take charge of her conscience but from what I could
make out she jolly well took charge of his The whole three of them
took charge of Joeys conscience He used to hear them arguing like
mad about everything You see the philosopher was a freethinker and
always believed the latest thing The priest didnt believe anything
because it was sure to get him into trouble with someone or another
And the natural father kept an open mind and believed whatever paid
him best Between the lot of them Joey got cultivated no end He
said if he could only have had three mothers as well hed have backed
himself against Napoleon

TARLETON _impressed_ Thats an idea Thats a most interesting
idea a most important idea

MRS TARLETON You always were one for ideas John

TARLETON Youre right Chickabiddy What do I tell Johnny when he
brags about Tarletons Underwear Its not the underwear The
underwear be hanged Anybody can make underwear Anybody can sell
underwear Tarletons Ideas thats whats done it Ive often thought
of putting that up over the shop

BENTLEY Take me into partnership when you do old man Im wasted
on the underwear but I shall come in strong on the ideas

TARLETON You be a good boy and perhaps I will

MRS TARLETON _scenting a plot against her beloved Johnny_ Now
John you promised

TARLETON Yes yes All right Chickabiddy dont fuss Your
precious Johnny shant be interfered with _Bouncing up too
energetic to sit still_ But Im getting sick of that old shop
Thirtyfive years Ive had of it same blessed old stairs to go up and
down every day same old lot same old game sorry I ever started
it now Ill chuck it and try something else something that will
give a scope to all my faculties

HYPATIA Theres money in underwear theres none in wildcat ideas

TARLETON Theres money in me madam no matter what I go into

MRS TARLETON Dont boast John Dont tempt Providence

TARLETON Rats You dont understand Providence Providence likes to
be tempted Thats the secret of the successful man Read Browning
Natural theology on an island eh Caliban was afraid to tempt
Providence that was why he was never able to get even with Prospero
What did Prospero do Prospero didnt even tempt Providence he was
Providence Thats one of Tarletons ideas and dont you forget it

BENTLEY You are full of beef today old man

TARLETON Beef be blowed Joy of life Read Ibsen _He goes into
the pavilion to relieve his restlessness and stares out with his
hands thrust deep in his pockets_

HYPATIA _thoughtful_ Bentley couldnt you invite your friend Mr
Percival down here

BENTLEY Not if I know it Youd throw me over the moment you set
eyes on him

MRS TARLETON Oh Bunny For shame

BENTLEY Well whod marry me dyou suppose if they could get my
brains with a fullsized body No thank you I shall take jolly
good care to keep Joey out of this until Hypatia is past praying for

_Johnny and Lord Summerhays return through the pavilion from their
stroll_

TARLETON Welcome welcome Why have you stayed away so long

LORD SUMMERHAYS _shaking hands_ Yes I should have come sooner
But Im still rather lost in England _Johnny takes his hat and
hangs it up beside his own_ Thank you _Johnny returns to his
swing and his novel Lord Summerhays comes to the writing table_
The fact is that as Ive nothing to do I never have time to go
anywhere _He sits down next Mrs Tarleton_

TARLETON _following him and sitting down on his left_ Paradox
paradox Good Paradoxes are the only truths Read Chesterton But
theres lots for you to do here You have a genius for government
You learnt your job out there in Jinghiskahn Well we want to be
governed here in England Govern us

LORD SUMMERHAYS Ah yes my friend but in Jinghiskahn you have to
govern the right way If you dont you go under and come home Here
everything has to be done the wrong way to suit governors who
understand nothing but partridge shooting our English native princes
in fact and voters who dont know what theyre voting about I dont
understand these democratic games and Im afraid Im too old to
learn What can I do but sit in the window of my club which consists
mostly of retired Indian Civil servants We look on at the muddle and
the folly and amateurishness and we ask each other where a single
fortnight of it would have landed us

TARLETON Very true Still Democracys all right you know Read
Mill Read Jefferson

LORD SUMMERHAYS Yes Democracy reads well but it doesnt act well
like some peoples plays No no my friend Tarleton to make
Democracy work you need an aristocratic democracy To make
Aristocracy work you need a democratic aristocracy Youve got
neither and theres an end of it

TARLETON Still you know the superman may come The supermans an
idea I believe in ideas Read Whatshisname

LORD SUMMERHAYS Reading is a dangerous amusement Tarleton I wish
I could persuade your free library people of that

TARLETON Why man its the beginning of education

LORD SUMMERHAYS On the contrary its the end of it How can you
dare teach a man to read until youve taught him everything else first

JOHNNY _intercepting his fathers reply by coming out of the swing
and taking the floor_ Leave it at that Thats good sense Anybody
on for a game of tennis

BENTLEY Oh lets have some more improving conversation Wouldnt you
rather Johnny

JOHNNY If you ask me no

TARLETON Johnny you dont cultivate your mind You dont read

JOHNNY _coming between his mother and Lord Summerhays book in
hand_ Yes I do I bet you what you like that page for page I read
more than you though I dont talk about it so much Only I dont read
the same books I like a book with a plot in it You like a book
with nothing in it but some idea that the chap that writes it keeps
worrying like a cat chasing its own tail I can stand a little of
it just as I can stand watching the cat for two minutes say when
Ive nothing better to do But a man soon gets fed up with that sort
of thing The fact is you look on an author as a sort of god _I_
look on him as a man that I pay to do a certain thing for me I pay
him to amuse me and to take me out of myself and make me forget

TARLETON No Wrong principle You want to remember Read Kipling
Lest we forget

JOHNNY If Kipling wants to remember let him remember If he had to
run Tarletons Underwear hed be jolly glad to forget As he has a
much softer job and wants to keep himself before the public his cry
is Dont you forget the sort of things Im rather clever at writing
about Well I dont blame him its his business I should do the
same in his place But what he wants and what I want are two
different things I want to forget and I pay another man to make me
forget If I buy a book or go to the theatre I want to forget the
shop and forget myself from the moment I go in to the moment I come
out Thats what I pay my money for And if I find that the authors
simply getting at me the whole time I consider that hes obtained my
money under false pretences Im not a morbid crank Im a natural
man and as such I dont like being got at If a man in my
employment did it I should sack him If a member of my club did it
I should cut him If he went too far with it I should bring his
conduct before the committee I might even punch his head if it came
to that Well who and what is an author that he should be privileged
to take liberties that are not allowed to other men

MRS TARLETON You see John What have I always told you Johnny
has as much to say for himself as anybody when he likes

JOHNNY Im no fool mother whatever some people may fancy I dont
set up to have as many ideas as the Governor but what ideas I have
are consecutive at all events I can think as well as talk

BENTLEY _to Tarleton chuckling_ Had you there old man hadnt
he You are rather all over the shop with your ideas aint you

JOHNNY _handsomely_ Im not saying anything against you
Governor But I do say that the time has come for sane healthy
unpretending men like me to make a stand against this conspiracy of
the writing and talking and artistic lot to put us in the back row
It isnt a fact that were inferior to them its a putup job and
its they that have put the job up Its we that run the country for
them and all the thanks we get is to be told were Philistines and
vulgar tradesmen and sordid city men and so forth and that theyre all
angels of light and leading The time has come to assert ourselves
and put a stop to their stuckup nonsense Perhaps if we had nothing
better to do than talking or writing we could do it better than they
Anyhow theyre the failures and refuse of business hardly a man of
them that didnt begin in an office and were the successes of it
Thank God I havnt failed yet at anything and I dont believe I should
fail at literature if it would pay me to turn my hand to it

BENTLEY Hear hear

MRS TARLETON Fancy you writing a book Johnny Do you think he
could Lord Summerhays

LORD SUMMERHAYS Why not As a matter of fact all the really
prosperous authors I have met since my return to England have been
very like him

TARLETON _again impressed_ Thats an idea Thats a new idea I
believe I ought to have made Johnny an author Ive never said so
before for fear of hurting his feelings because after all the lad
cant help it but Ive never thought Johnny worth tuppence as a man of
business

JOHNNY _sarcastic_ Oh You think youve always kept that to
yourself do you Governor I know your opinion of me as well as you
know it yourself It takes one man of business to appreciate another
and you arnt and you never have been a real man of business I know
where Tarletons would have been three of four times if it hadnt been
for me _With a snort and a nod to emphasize the implied warning he
retreats to the Turkish bath and lolls against it with an air of
goodhumoured indifference_

TARLETON Well who denies it Youre quite right my boy I dont
mind confessing to you all that the circumstances that condemned me to
keep a shop are the biggest tragedy in modern life I ought to have
been a writer Im essentially a man of ideas When I was a young
man I sometimes used to pray that I might fail so that I should be
justified in giving up business and doing something something
firstclass But it was no good I couldnt fail I said to myself
that if I could only once go to my Chickabiddy here and shew her a
chartered accountants statement proving that Id made 20 pounds less
than last year I could ask her to let me chance Johnnys and
Hypatias future by going into literature But it was no good First
it was 250 pounds more than last year Then it was 700 pounds Then
it was 2000 pounds Then I saw it was no use Prometheus was chained
to his rock read Shelley read Mrs Browning Well well it was
not to be _He rises solemnly_ Lord Summerhays I ask you to
excuse me for a few moments There are times when a man needs to
meditate in solitude on his destiny A chord is touched and he sees
the drama of his life as a spectator sees a play Laugh if you feel
inclined no man sees the comic side of it more than I In the
theatre of life everyone may be amused except the actor
_Brightening_ Theres an idea in this an idea for a picture What
a pity young Bentley is not a painter Tarleton meditating on his
destiny Not in a toga Not in the trappings of the tragedian or the
philosopher In plain coat and trousers a man like any other man
And beneath that coat and trousers a human soul Tarletons
Underwear _He goes out gravely into the vestibule_

MRS TARLETON _fondly_ I suppose its a wifes partiality Lord
Summerhays but I do think John is really great Im sure he was
meant to be a king My father looked down on John because he was a
rate collector and John kept a shop It hurt his pride to have to
borrow money so often from John and he used to console himself by
saying After all hes only a linendraper But at last one day he
said to me John is a king

BENTLEY How much did he borrow on that occasion

LORD SUMMERHAYS _sharply_ Bentley

MRS TARLETON Oh dont scold the child hed have to say something
like that if it was to be his last word on earth Besides hes quite
right my poor father had asked for his usual five pounds and John
gave him a hundred in his big way Just like a king

LORD SUMMERHAYS Not at all I had five kings to manage in
Jinghiskahn and I think you do your husband some injustice Mrs
Tarleton They pretended to like me because I kept their brothers
from murdering them but I didnt like them And I like Tarleton

MRS TARLETON Everybody does I really must go and make the cook do
him a Welsh rabbit He expects one on special occasions _She goes
to the inner door_ Johnny when he comes back ask him where were
to put that new Turkish bath Turkish baths are his latest _She
goes out_

JOHNNY _coming forward again_ Now that the Governor has given
himself away and the old ladys gone Ill tell you something Lord
Summerhays If you study men whove made an enormous pile in business
without being keen on money youll find that they all have a slate
off The Governors a wonderful man but hes not quite all there you
know If you notice hes different from me and whatever my failings
may be Im a sane man Erratic thats what he is And the danger
is that some day hell give the whole show away

LORD SUMMERHAYS Giving the show away is a method like any other
method Keeping it to yourself is only another method I should keep
an open mind about it

JOHNNY Has it ever occurred to you that a man with an open mind must
be a bit of a scoundrel If you ask me I like a man who makes up his
mind once for all as to whats right and whats wrong and then sticks to
it At all events you know where to have him

LORD SUMMERHAYS That may not be his object

BENTLEY He may want to have you old chap

JOHNNY Well let him If a member of my club wants to steal my
umbrella he knows where to find it If a man put up for the club who
had an open mind on the subject of property in umbrellas I should
blackball him An open mind is all very well in clever talkytalky
but in conduct and in business give me solid ground

LORD SUMMERHAYS Yes the quicksands make life difficult Still
there they are Its no use pretending theyre rocks

JOHNNY I dont know You can draw a line and make other chaps toe
it Thats what I call morality

LORD SUMMERHAYS Very true But you dont make any progress when
youre toeing a line

HYPATIA _suddenly as if she could bear no more of it_ Bentley
do go and play tennis with Johnny You must take exercise

LORD SUMMERHAYS Do my boy do _To Johnny_ Take him out and
make him skip about

BENTLEY _rising reluctantly_ I promised you two inches more round
my chest this summer I tried exercises with an indiarubber expander
but I wasnt strong enough instead of my expanding it it crumpled me
up Come along Johnny

JOHNNY Do you no end of good young chap _He goes out with
Bentley through the pavilion_

_Hypatia throws aside her work with an enormous sigh of relief_

LORD SUMMERHAYS At last

HYPATIA At last Oh if I might only have a holiday in an asylum
for the dumb How I envy the animals They cant talk If Johnny
could only put back his ears or wag his tail instead of laying down
the law how much better it would be We should know when he was
cross and when he was pleased and thats all we know now with all his
talk It never stops talk talk talk talk Thats my life All
the day I listen to mamma talking at dinner I listen to papa talking
and when papa stops for breath I listen to Johnny talking

LORD SUMMERHAYS You make me feel very guilty I talk too Im
afraid

HYPATIA Oh I dont mind that because your talk is a novelty But
it must have been dreadful for your daughters

LORD SUMMERHAYS I suppose so

HYPATIA If parents would only realize how they bore their children
Three or four times in the last half hour Ive been on the point of
screaming

LORD SUMMERHAYS Were we very dull

HYPATIA Not at all you were very clever Thats whats so hard to
bear because it makes it so difficult to avoid listening You see
Im young and I do so want something to happen My mother tells me
that when Im her age I shall be only too glad that nothings
happened but Im not her age so what good is that to me Theres my
father in the garden meditating on his destiny All very well for
him hes had a destiny to meditate on but I havnt had any destiny
yet Everythings happened to him nothings happened to me Thats
why this unending talk is so maddeningly uninteresting to me

LORD SUMMERHAYS It would be worse if we sat in silence

HYPATIA No it wouldnt If you all sat in silence as if you were
waiting for something to happen then there would be hope even if
nothing did happen But this eternal cackle cackle cackle about
things in general is only fit for old old OLD people I suppose it
means something to them theyve had their fling All I listen for is
some sign of it ending in something but just when it seems to be
coming to a point Johnny or papa just starts another hare and it all
begins over again and I realize that its never going to lead
anywhere and never going to stop Thats when I want to scream I
wonder how you can stand it

LORD SUMMERHAYS Well Im old and garrulous myself you see
Besides Im not here of my own free will exactly I came because
you ordered me to come

HYPATIA Didnt you want to come

LORD SUMMERHAYS My dear after thirty years of managing other
peoples business men lose the habit of considering what they want or
dont want

HYPATIA Oh dont begin to talk about what men do and about thirty
years experience If you cant get off that subject youd better send
for Johnny and papa and begin it all over again

LORD SUMMERHAYS Im sorry I beg your pardon

HYPATIA I asked you didnt you want to come

LORD SUMMERHAYS I did not stop to consider whether I wanted or not
because when I read your letter I knew I had to come

HYPATIA Why

LORD SUMMERHAYS Oh come Miss Tarleton Really really Dont force
me to call you a blackmailer to your face You have me in your power
and I do what you tell me very obediently Dont ask me to pretend I
do it of my own free will

HYPATIA I dont know what a blackmailer is I havnt even that much
experience

LORD SUMMERHAYS A blackmailer my dear young lady is a person who
knows a disgraceful secret in the life of another person and extorts
money from that other person by threatening to make his secret public
unless the money is paid

HYPATIA I havnt asked you for money

LORD SUMMERHAYS No but you asked me to come down here and talk to
you and you mentioned casually that if I didnt youd have nobody to
talk about me to but Bentley That was a threat was it not

HYPATIA Well I wanted you to come

LORD SUMMERHAYS In spite of my age and my unfortunate talkativeness

HYPATIA I like talking to you I can let myself go with you I can
say things to you I cant say to other people

LORD SUMMERHAYS I wonder why

HYPATIA Well you are the only really clever grownup highclass
experienced man I know who has given himself away to me by making an
utter fool of himself with me You cant wrap yourself up in your toga
after that You cant give yourself airs with me

LORD SUMMERHAYS You mean you can tell Bentley about me if I do

HYPATIA Even if there wasnt any Bentley even if you didnt care
and I really dont see why you should care so much still we never
could be on conventional terms with one another again Besides Ive
got a feeling for you almost a ghastly sort of love for you

LORD SUMMERHAYS _shrinking_ I beg youno please

HYPATIA Oh its nothing at all flattering and of course nothing
wrong as I suppose youd call it

LORD SUMMERHAYS Please believe that I know that When men of my
age

HYPATIA _impatiently_ Oh do talk about yourself when you mean
yourself and not about men of your age

LORD SUMMERHAYS Ill put it as bluntly as I can When as you say
I made an utter fool of myself believe me I made a poetic fool of
myself I was seduced not by appetites which thank Heaven Ive long
outlived not even by the desire of second childhood for a child
companion but by the innocent impulse to place the delicacy and
wisdom and spirituality of my age at the affectionate service of your
youth for a few years at the end of which you would be a grown
strong formedwidow Alas my dear the delicacy of age reckoned
as usual without the derision and cruelty of youth You told me that
you didnt want to be an old mans nurse and that you didnt want to
have undersized children like Bentley It served me right I dont
reproach you I was an old fool But how you can imagine after
that that I can suspect you of the smallest feeling for me except the
inevitable feeling of early youth for late age or imagine that I have
any feeling for you except one of shrinking humiliation I cant
understand

HYPATIA I dont blame you for falling in love with me I shall be
grateful to you all my life for it because that was the first time
that anything really interesting happened to me

LORD SUMMERHAYS Do you mean to tell me that nothing of that kind had
ever happened before that no man had ever

HYPATIA Oh lots Thats part of the routine of life here the very
dullest part of it The young man who comes acourting is as familiar
an incident in my life as coffee for breakfast Of course hes too
much of a gentleman to misbehave himself and Im too much of a lady
to let him and hes shy and sheepish and Im correct and
selfpossessed and at last when I can bear it no longer I either
frighten him off or give him a chance of proposing just to see how
hell do it and refuse him because he does it in the same silly way
as all the rest You dont call that an event in ones life do you
With you it was different I should as soon have expected the North
Pole to fall in love with me as you You know Im only a
linendrapers daughter when alls said I was afraid of you you a
great man a lord and older than my father And then what a
situation it was Just think of it I was engaged to your son and
you knew nothing about it He was afraid to tell you he brought you
down here because he thought if he could throw us together I could get
round you because I was such a ripping girl We arranged it all he
and I We got Papa and Mamma and Johnny out of the way splendidly
and then Bentley took himself off and left usyou and meto take a
walk through the heather and admire the scenery of Hindhead You
never dreamt that it was all a plan that what made me so nice was
the way I was playing up to my destiny as the sweet girl that was to
make your boy happy And then and then _She rises to dance and
clap her hands in her glee_

LORD SUMMERHAYS _shuddering_ Stop stop Can no woman understand
a mans delicacy

HYPATIA _revelling in the recollection_ And thenha hayou
proposed You A father For your sons girl

LORD SUMMERHAYS Stop I tell you Dont profane what you dont
understand

HYPATIA That was something happening at last with a vengeance It
was splendid It was my first peep behind the scenes If Id been
seventeen I should have fallen in love with you Even as it is I
feel quite differently towards you from what I do towards other old
men So _offering her hand_ you may kiss my hand if that will be
any fun for you

LORD SUMMERHAYS _rising and recoiling to the table deeply
revolted_ No no no How dare you _She laughs mischievously_
How callous youth is How coarse How cynical How ruthlessly
cruel

HYPATIA Stuff Its only that youre tired of a great many things
Ive never tried

LORD SUMMERHAYS Its not alone that Ive not forgotten the
brutality of my own boyhood But do try to learn glorious young
beast that you are that age is squeamish sentimental fastidious
If you cant understand my holier feelings at least you know the
bodily infirmities of the old You know that I darent eat all the
rich things you gobble up at every meal that I cant bear the noise
and racket and clatter that affect you no more than they affect a
stone Well my soul is like that too Spare it be gentle with it
_he involuntarily puts out his hands to plead she takes them with a
laugh_ If you could possibly think of me as half an angel and half
an invalid we should get on much better together

HYPATIA We get on very well I think Nobody else ever called me a
glorious young beast I like that Glorious young beast expresses
exactly what I like to be

LORD SUMMERHAYS _extricating his hands and sitting down_ Where on
earth did you get these morbid tastes You seem to have been well
brought up in a normal healthy respectable middleclass family
Yet you go on like the most unwholesome product of the rankest
Bohemianism

HYPATIA Thats just it Im fed up with

LORD SUMMERHAYS Horrible expression Dont

HYPATIA Oh I daresay its vulgar but theres no other word for it
Im fed up with nice things with respectability with propriety
When a woman has nothing to do money and respectability mean that
nothing is ever allowed to happen to her I dont want to be good and
I dont want to be bad I just dont want to be bothered about either
good or bad I want to be an active verb

LORD SUMMERHAYS An active verb Oh I see An active verb
signifies to be to do or to suffer

HYPATIA Just so how clever of you I want to be I want to do
and Im game to suffer if it costs that But stick here doing nothing
but being good and nice and ladylike I simply wont Stay down here
with us for a week and Ill shew you what it means shew it to you
going on day after day year after year lifetime after lifetime

LORD SUMMERHAYS Shew me what

HYPATIA Girls withering into ladies Ladies withering into old
maids Nursing old women Running errands for old men Good for
nothing else at last Oh you cant imagine the fiendish selfishness
of the old people and the maudlin sacrifice of the young
Its more unbearable than any poverty more horrible than any
regularrightdown wickedness Oh home home parents family duty
how I loathe them How Id like to see them all blown to bits The
poor escape The wicked escape Well I cant be poor were rolling
in money its no use pretending were not But I can be wicked and
Im quite prepared to be

LORD SUMMERHAYS You think that easy

HYPATIA Well isnt it Being a man you ought to know

LORD SUMMERHAYS It requires some natural talent which can no doubt
be cultivated Its not really easy to be anything out of the common

HYPATIA Anyhow I mean to make a fight for living

LORD SUMMERHAYS Living your own life I believe the Suffragist
phrase is

HYPATIA Living any life Living instead of withering without even
a gardener to snip you off when youre rotten

LORD SUMMERHAYS Ive lived an active life but Ive withered all the
same

HYPATIA No youve worn out thats quite different And youve some
life in you yet or you wouldnt have fallen in love with me You can
never imagine how delighted I was to find that instead of being the
correct sort of big panjandrum you were supposed to be you were
really an old rip like papa

LORD SUMMERHAYS No no not about your father I really cant bear
it And if you must say these terrible things these heartwounding
shameful things at least find something prettier to call me than an
old rip

HYPATIA Well what would you call a man proposing to a girl who
might be

LORD SUMMERHAYS His daughter yes I know

HYPATIA I was going to say his granddaughter

LORD SUMMERHAYS You always have one more blow to get in

HYPATIA Youre too sensitive Did you ever make mud pies when you
were a kidbeg pardon a child

LORD SUMMERHAYS I hope not

HYPATIA Its a dirty job but Johnny and I were vulgar enough to
like it I like young people because theyre not too afraid of dirt to
live Ive grown out of the mud pies but I like slang and I like
bustling you up by saying things that shock you and Id rather put up
with swearing and smoking than with dull respectability and there are
lots of things that would just shrivel you up that I think rather
jolly Now

LORD SUMMERHAYS Ive not the slightest doubt of it Dont insist

HYPATIA Its not your ideal is it

LORD SUMMERHAYS No

HYPATIA Shall I tell you why Your ideal is an old woman I
daresay shes got a young face but shes an old woman Old old old
Squeamish Cant stand up to things Cant enjoy things not real
things Always on the shrink

LORD SUMMERHAYS On the shrink Detestable expression

HYPATIA Bah you cant stand even a little thing like that What
good are you Oh what good are you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Dont ask me I dont know I dont know

_Tarleton returns from the vestibule Hypatia sits down demurely_

HYPATIA Well papa have you meditated on your destiny

TARLETON _puzzled_ What Oh my destiny Gad I forgot all
about it Jock started a rabbit and put it clean out of my head
Besides why should I give way to morbid introspection Its a sign
of madness Read Lombroso _To Lord Summerhays_ Well Summerhays
has my little girl been entertaining you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Yes She is a wonderful entertainer

TARLETON I think my idea of bringing up a young girl has been rather
a success Dont you listen to this Patsy it might make you
conceited Shes never been treated like a child I always said the
same thing to her mother Let her read what she likes Let her do
what she likes Let her go where she likes Eh Patsy

HYPATIA Oh yes if there had only been anything for me to do any
place for me to go anything I wanted to read

TARLETON There you see Shes not satisfied Restless Wants
things to happen Wants adventures to drop out of the sky

HYPATIA _gathering up her work_ If youre going to talk about me
and my education Im off

TARLETON Well well off with you _To Lord Summerhays_ Shes
active like me She actually wanted me to put her into the shop

HYPATIA Well they tell me that the girls there have adventures
sometimes _She goes out through the inner door_

TARLETON She had me there though she doesnt know it poor innocent
lamb Public scandal exaggerates enormously of course but moralize
as you will superabundant vitality is a physical fact that cant be
talked away _He sits down between the writing table and the
sideboard_ Difficult question this of bringing up children
Between ourselves it has beaten me I never was so surprised in my
life as when I came to know Johnny as a man of business and found out
what he was really like How did you manage with your sons

LORD SUMMERHAYS Well I really hadnt time to be a father thats the
plain truth of the matter Their poor dear mother did the usual thing
while they were with us Then of course Harrow Cambridge the usual
routine of their class I saw very little of them and thought very
little about them how could I with a whole province on my hands
They and I areacquaintances Not perhaps quite ordinary
acquaintances theres a sort oferI should almost call it a sort
of remorse about the way we shake hands when we do shake hands which
means I suppose that were sorry we dont care more for one another
and Im afraid we dont meet oftener than we can help We put each
other too much out of countenance Its really a very difficult
relation To my mind not altogether a natural one

TARLETON _impressed as usual_ Thats an idea certainly I dont
think anybody has ever written about that

LORD SUMMERHAYS Bentley is the only one who was really my son in any
serious sense He was completely spoilt When he was sent to a
preparatory school he simply yelled until he was sent home Harrow
was out of the question but we managed to tutor him into Cambridge
No use he was sent down By that time my work was over and I saw a
good deal of him But I could do nothing with himexcept look on I
should have thought your case was quite different You keep up the
middleclass tradition the day school and the business training
instead of the university I believe in the day school part of it
At all events you know your own children

TARLETON Do you Im not so sure of it Fact is my dear
Summerhays once childhood is over once the little animal has got
past the stage at which it acquires what you might call a sense of
decency its all up with the relation between parent and child You
cant get over the fearful shyness of it

LORD SUMMERHAYS Shyness

TARLETON Yes shyness Read Dickens

LORD SUMMERHAYS _surprised_ Dickens Of all authors Charles
Dickens Are you serious

TARLETON I dont mean his books Read his letters to his family
Read any mans letters to his children Theyre not human Theyre not
about himself or themselves Theyre about hotels scenery about the
weather about getting wet and losing the train and what he saw on the
road and all that Not a word about himself Forced Shy Duty
letters All fit to be published that says everything I tell you
theres a wall ten feet thick and ten miles high between parent and
child I know what Im talking about Ive girls in my employment
girls and young men I had ideas on the subject I used to go to the
parents and tell them not to let their children go out into the world
without instruction in the dangers and temptations they were going to
be thrown into What did every one of the mothers say to me Oh
sir how could I speak of such things to my own daughter The men
said I was quite right but they didnt do it any more than Id been
able to do it myself to Johnny I had to leave books in his way and
I felt just awful when I did it Believe me Summerhays the relation
between the young and the old should be an innocent relation It
should be something they could talk about Well the relation between
parent and child may be an affectionate relation It may be a useful
relation It may be a necessary relation But it can never be an
innocent relation Youd die rather than allude to it Depend on it
in a thousand years itll be considered bad form to know who your
father and mother are Embarrassing Better hand Bentley over to me
I can look him in the face and talk to him as man to man You can
have Johnny

LORD SUMMERHAYS Thank you Ive lived so long in a country where a
man may have fifty sons who are no more to him than a regiment of
soldiers that Im afraid Ive lost the English feeling about it

TARLETON _restless again_ You mean Jinghiskahn Ah yes Good
thing the empire Educates us Opens our minds Knocks the Bible
out of us And civilizes the other chaps

LORD SUMMERHAYS Yes it civilizes them And it uncivilizes us
Their gain Our loss Tarleton believe me our loss

TARLETON Well why not Averages out the human race Makes the
nigger half an Englishman Makes the Englishman half a nigger

LORD SUMMERHAYS Speaking as the unfortunate Englishman in question
I dont like the process If I had my life to live over again Id
stay at home and supercivilize myself

TARLETON Nonsense dont be selfish Think how youve improved the
other chaps Look at the Spanish empire Bad job for Spain but
splendid for South America Look at what the Romans did for Britain
They burst up and had to clear out but think of all they taught us
They were the making of us I believe there was a Roman camp on
Hindhead Ill shew it to you tomorrow Thats the good side of
Imperialism its unselfish I despise the Little Englanders
theyre always thinking about England Smallminded Im for the
Parliament of man the federation of the world Read Tennyson _He
settles down again_ Then theres the great food question

LORD SUMMERHAYS _apprehensively_ Need we go into that this
afternoon

TARLETON No but I wish youd tell the Chickabiddy that the
Jinghiskahns eat no end of toasted cheese and that its the secret of
their amazing health and long life

LORD SUMMERHAYS Unfortunately they are neither healthy nor long
lived And they dont eat toasted cheese

TARLETON There you are They would be if they ate it Anyhow
say what you like provided the moral is a Welsh rabbit for my supper

LORD SUMMERHAYS British morality in a nutshell

TARLETON _hugely amused_ Yes Ha ha Awful hypocrites aint we

_They are interrupted by excited cries from the grounds_

HYPATIA  Papa Mamma Come out as fast as you can
  Quick Quick
 
BENTLEY  Hello governor Come out An aeroplane
  Look look

TARLETON _starting up_ Aeroplane Did he say an aeroplane

LORD SUMMERHAYS Aeroplane _A shadow falls on the pavilion and
some of the glass at the top is shattered and falls on the floor_

_Tarleton and Lord Summerhays rush out through the pavilion into the
garden_

HYPATIA  Take care Take care of the chimney
 
BENTLEY  Come this side its coming right
  where youre standing
 
TARLETON  Hallo where the devil are you
  coming youll have my roof off
 
LORD SUMMERHAYS Hes lost control

MRS TARLETON Look look Hypatia There are two people in it

BENTLEY Theyve cleared it Well steered

TARLETON  Yes but theyre coming slam into the greenhouse
 
LORD SUMMERHAYS Look out for the glass
 
MRS TARLETON  Theyll break all the glass Theyll
  spoil all the grapes
 
BENTLEY  Mind where youre coming Hell
  save it No theyre down

_An appalling crash of breaking glass is heard Everybody shrieks_

MRS TARLETON  Oh are they killed John are they killed
 
LORD SUMMERHAYS Are you hurt Is anything broken Can you stand
 
HYPATIA  Oh you must be hurt Are you sure Shall I get
  you some water Or some wine
 
TARLETON  Are you all right Sure you wont have some
  brandy just to take off the shock

THE AVIATOR No thank you Quite right Not a scratch I assure
you Im all right

BENTLEY What luck And what a smash You are a lucky chap I can
tell you

_The Aviator and Tarleton come in through the pavilion followed by
Lord Summerhays and Bentley the Aviator on Tarletons right Bentley
passes the Aviator and turns to have an admiring look at him Lord
Summerhays overtakes Tarleton less pointedly on the opposite side with
the same object_

THE AVIATOR Im really very sorry Im afraid Ive knocked your
vinery into a cocked hat _Effusively_ You dont mind do you

TARLETON Not a bit Come in and have some tea Stay to dinner
Stay over the weekend All my life Ive wanted to fly

THE AVIATOR _taking off his goggles_ Youre really more than kind

BENTLEY Why its Joey Percival

PERCIVAL Hallo Ben That you

TARLETON What The man with three fathers

PERCIVAL Oh has Ben been talking about me

TARLETON Consider yourself as one of the familyif you will do me
the honor And your friend too Wheres your friend

PERCIVAL Oh by the way before he comes in let me explain I
dont know him

TARLETON Eh

PERCIVAL Havnt even looked at him Im trying to make a club record
with a passenger The club supplied the passenger He just got in
and Ive been too busy handling the aeroplane to look at him I havnt
said a word to him and I cant answer for him socially but hes an
ideal passenger for a flyer He saved me from a smash

LORD SUMMERHAYS I saw it It was extraordinary When you were
thrown out he held on to the top bar with one hand You came past him
in the air going straight for the glass He caught you and turned
you off into the flower bed and then lighted beside you like a bird

PERCIVAL How he kept his head I cant imagine Frankly _I_ didnt

_The Passenger also begoggled comes in through the pavilion with
Johnny and the two ladies The Passenger comes between Percival and
Tarleton Mrs Tarleton between Lord Summerhays and her husband
Hypatia between Percival and Bentley and Johnny to Bentleys right_

TARLETON Just discussing your prowess my dear sir Magnificent
Youll stay to dinner Youll stay the night Stay over the week The
Chickabiddy will be delighted

MRS TARLETON Wont you take off your goggles and have some tea

_The Passenger begins to remove the goggles_

TARLETON Do Have a wash Johnny take the gentleman to your
room Ill look after Mr Percival They must

_By this time the passenger has got the goggles off and stands
revealed as a remarkably goodlooking woman_

MRS TARLETON  Well I never 
  
BENTLEY  _in a whisper_ Oh I say 
  
JOHNNY  By George 
   _All
LORD SUMMERHAYS A lady  to
   gether_
HYPATIA  A woman 
  
TARLETON  _to Percival_ You never told me 
  
PERCIVAL  I hadnt the least idea 

_An embarrassed pause_

PERCIVAL I assure you if Id had the faintest notion that my
passenger was a lady I shouldnt have left you to shift for yourself in
that selfish way

LORD SUMMERHAYS The lady seems to have shifted for both very
effectually sir

PERCIVAL Saved my life I admit it most gratefully

TARLETON I must apologize madam for having offered you the
civilities appropriate to the opposite sex And yet why opposite
We are all human males and females of the same species When the
dress is the same the distinction vanishes Im proud to receive in
my house a lady of evident refinement and distinction Allow me to
introduce myself Tarleton John Tarleton _seeing conjecture in the
passengers eye_yes yes Tarletons Underwear My wife Mrs
Tarleton youll excuse me for having in what I had taken to be a
confidence between man and man alluded to her as the Chickabiddy My
daughter Hypatia who has always wanted some adventure to drop out of
the sky and is now I hope satisfied at last Lord Summerhays a
man known wherever the British flag waves His son Bentley engaged
to Hypatia Mr Joseph Percival the promising son of three highly
intellectual fathers

HYPATIA _startled_ Bentleys friend _Bentley nods_

TARLETON _continuing to the passenger_ May I now ask to be
allowed the pleasure of knowing your name

THE PASSENGER My name is Lina Szczepanowska _pronouncing it
ShChepanovska_

PERCIVAL Sh I beg your pardon

LINA Szczepanowska

PERCIVAL _dubiously_ Thank you

TARLETON _very politely_ Would you mind saying it again

LINA Say fish

TARLETON Fish

LINA Say church

TARLETON Church

LINA Say fish church

TARLETON _remonstrating_ But its not good sense

LINA _inexorable_ Say fish church

TARLETON Fish church

LINA Again

TARLETON No but_resigning himself_ fish church

LINA Now say Szczepanowska

TARLETON Szczepanowska Got it by Gad _A sibilant whispering
becomes audible they are all saying Shch to themselves_
Szczepanowska Not an English name is it

LINA Polish Im a Pole

TARLETON Ah yes Interesting nation Lucky people to get the
government of their country taken off their hands Nothing to do but
cultivate themselves Same as we took Gibraltar off the hands of the
Spaniards Saves the Spanish taxpayer Jolly good thing for us if
the Germans took Portsmouth Sit down wont you

_The group breaks up Johnny and Bentley hurry to the pavilion and
fetch the two wicker chairs Johnny gives his to Lina Hypatia and
Percival take the chairs at the worktable Lord Summerhays gives the
chair at the vestibule end of the writing table to Mrs Tarleton and
Bentley replaces it with a wicker chair which Lord Summerhays takes
Johnny remains standing behind the worktable Bentley behind his
father_

MRS TARLETON _to Lina_ Have some tea now wont you

LINA I never drink tea

TARLETON _sitting down at the end of the writing table nearest
Lina_ Bad thing to aeroplane on I should imagine Too jumpy Been
up much

LINA Not in an aeroplane Ive parachuted but thats childs play

MRS TARLETON But arnt you very foolish to run such a dreadful risk

LINA You cant live without running risks

MRS TARLETON Oh what a thing to say Didnt you know you might have
been killed

LINA That was why I went up

HYPATIA Of course Cant you understand the fascination of the
thing the novelty the daring the sense of something happening

LINA Oh no Its too tame a business for that I went up for
family reasons

TARLETON Eh What Family reasons

MRS TARLETON I hope it wasnt to spite your mother

PERCIVAL _quickly_ Or your husband

LINA Im not married And why should I want to spite my mother

HYPATIA _aside to Percival_ That was clever of you Mr Percival

PERCIVAL What

HYPATIA To find out

TARLETON Im in a difficulty I cant understand a lady going up in
an aeroplane for family reasons Its rude to be curious and ask
questions but then its inhuman to be indifferent as if you didnt
care

LINA Ill tell you with pleasure For the last hundred and fifty
years not a single day has passed without some member of my family
risking his lifeor her life Its a point of honor with us to keep
up that tradition Usually several of us do it but it happens that
just at this moment it is being kept up by one of my brothers only
Early this morning I got a telegram from him to say that there had
been a fire and that he could do nothing for the rest of the week
Fortunately I had an invitation from the Aerial League to see this
gentleman try to break the passenger record I appealed to the
President of the League to let me save the honor of my family He
arranged it for me

TARLETON Oh I must be dreaming This is stark raving nonsense

LINA _quietly_ You are quite awake sir

JOHNNY We cant all be dreaming the same thing Governor

TARLETON Of course not you duffer but then Im dreaming you as
well as the lady

MRS TARLETON Dont be silly John The lady is only joking Im
sure _To Lina_ I suppose your luggage is in the aeroplane

PERCIVAL Luggage was out of the question If I stay to dinner Im
afraid I cant change unless youll lend me some clothes

MRS TARLETON Do you mean neither of you

PERCIVAL Im afraid so

MRS TARLETON Oh well never mind Hypatia will lend the lady a
gown

LINA Thank you Im quite comfortable as I am I am not accustomed
to gowns they hamper me and make me feel ridiculous so if you dont
mind I shall not change

MRS TARLETON Well Im beginning to think Im doing a bit of
dreaming myself

HYPATIA _impatiently_ Oh its all right mamma Johnny look
after Mr Percival _To Lina rising_ Come with me

_Lina follows her to the inner door They all rise_

JOHNNY _to Percival_ Ill shew you

PERCIVAL Thank you

_Lina goes out with Hypatia and Percival with Johnny_

MRS TARLETON Well this is a nice thing to happen And look at the
greenhouse Itll cost thirty pounds to mend it People have no right
to do such things And you invited them to dinner too What sort of
woman is that to have in our house when you know that all Hindhead
will be calling on us to see that aeroplane Bunny come with me and
help me to get all the people out of the grounds I declare they came
running as if theyd sprung up out of the earth _she makes for the
inner door_

TARLETON No dont you trouble Chickabiddy Ill tackle em

MRS TARLETON Indeed youll do nothing of the kind youll stay here
quietly with Lord Summerhays Youd invite them all to dinner Come
Bunny _She goes out followed by Bentley Lord Summerhays sits
down again_

TARLETON Singularly beautiful woman Summerhays What do you make of
her She must be a princess Whats this family of warriors and
statesmen that risk their lives every day

LORD SUMMERHAYS They are evidently not warriors and statesmen or
they wouldnt do that

TARLETON Well then who the devil are they

LORD SUMMERHAYS I think I know The last time I saw that lady she
did something I should not have thought possible

TARLETON What was that

LORD SUMMERHAYS Well she walked backwards along a taut wire without
a balancing pole and turned a somersault in the middle I remember
that her name was Lina and that the other name was foreign though I
dont recollect it

TARLETON Szcz You couldnt have forgotten that if youd heard it

LORD SUMMERHAYS I didnt hear it I only saw it on a program But
its clear shes an acrobat It explains how she saved Percival And
it accounts for her family pride

TARLETON An acrobat eh Good good good Summerhays that
brings her within reach Thats better than a princess I steeled
this evergreen heart of mine when I thought she was a princess Now I
shall let it be touched She is accessible Good

LORD SUMMERHAYS I hope you are not serious Remember you have a
family You have a position You are not in your first youth

TARLETON No matter

 Theres magic in the night
 When the heart is young

My heart is young Besides Im a married man not a widower like
you A married man can do anything he likes if his wife dont mind A
widower cant be too careful Not that I would have you think me an
unprincipled man or a bad husband Im not But Ive a superabundance
of vitality Read Pepys Diary

LORD SUMMERHAYS The woman is your guest Tarleton

TARLETON Well is she A woman I bring into my house is my guest
A woman you bring into my house is my guest But a woman who drops
bang down out of the sky into my greenhouse and smashes every blessed
pane of glass in it must take her chance

LORD SUMMERHAYS Still you know that my name must not be associated
with any scandal Youll be careful wont you

TARLETON Oh Lord yes Yes yes yes yes yes I was only joking
of course

_Mrs Tarleton comes back through the inner door_

MRS TARLETON Well I never John I dont think that young womans
right in her head Do you know what shes just asked for

TARLETON Champagne

MRS TARLETON No She wants a Bible and six oranges

TARLETON What

MRS TARLETON A Bible and six oranges

TARLETON I understand the oranges shes doing an orange cure of
some sort But what on earth does she want the Bible for

MRS TARLETON Im sure I cant imagine She cant be right in her
head

LORD SUMMERHAYS Perhaps she wants to read it

MRS TARLETON But why should she on a weekday at all events What
would you advise me to do Lord Summerhays

LORD SUMMERHAYS Well is there a Bible in the house

TARLETON Stacks of em Theres the family Bible and the Dore Bible
and the parallel revised version Bible and the Doves Press Bible and
Johnnys Bible and Bobbys Bible and Patsys Bible and the
Chickabiddys Bible and my Bible and I daresay the servants could
raise a few more between them Let her have the lot

MRS TARLETON Dont talk like that before Lord Summerhays John

LORD SUMMERHAYS It doesnt matter Mrs Tarleton in Jinghiskahn it
was a punishable offence to expose a Bible for sale The empire has
no religion

_Lina comes in She has left her cap in Hypatias room She stops on
the landing just inside the door and speaks over the handrail_

LINA Oh Mrs Tarleton shall I be making myself very troublesome if
I ask for a musicstand in my room as well

TARLETON Not at all You can have the piano if you like Or the
gramophone Have the gramophone

LINA No thank you no music

MRS TARLETON _going to the steps_ Do you think its good for you
to eat so many oranges Arnt you afraid of getting jaundice

LINA _coming down_ Not in the least But billiard balls will do
quite as well

MRS TARLETON But you cant eat billiard balls child

TARLETON Get em Chickabiddy I understand _He imitates a
juggler tossing up balls_ Eh

LINA _going to him past his wife_ Just so

TARLETON Billiard balls and cues Plates knives and forks Two
paraffin lamps and a hatstand

LINA No that is popular lowclass business In our family we
touch nothing but classical work Anybody can do lamps and hatstands
_I_ can do silver bullets That is really hard _She passes on to
Lord Summerhays and looks gravely down at him as he sits by the
writing table_

MRS TARLETON Well Im sure I dont know what youre talking about
and I only hope you know yourselves However you shall have what you
want of course _She goes up the steps and leaves the room_

LORD SUMMERHAYS Will you forgive my curiosity What is the Bible
for

LINA To quiet my soul

LORD SUMMERHAYS _with a sigh_ Ah yes yes It no longer quiets
mine I am sorry to say

LINA That is because you do not know how to read it Put it up
before you on a stand and open it at the Psalms When you can read
them and understand them quite quietly and happily and keep six
balls in the air all the time you are in perfect condition and youll
never make a mistake that evening If you find you cant do that then
go and pray until you can And be very careful that evening

LORD SUMMERHAYS Is that the usual form of test in your profession

LINA Nothing that we Szczepanowskis do is usual my lord

LORD SUMMERHAYS Are you all so wonderful

LINA It is our profession to be wonderful

LORD SUMMERHAYS Do you never condescend to do as common people do
For instance do you not pray as common people pray

LINA Common people do not pray my lord they only beg

LORD SUMMERHAYS You never ask for anything

LINA No

LORD SUMMERHAYS Then why do you pray

LINA To remind myself that I have a soul

TARLETON _walking about_ True Fine Good Beautiful All
this damned materialism what good is it to anybody Ive got a soul
dont tell me I havnt Cut me up and you cant find it Cut up a steam
engine and you cant find the steam But by George it makes the
engine go Say what you will Summerhays the divine spark is a fact

LORD SUMMERHAYS Have I denied it

TARLETON Our whole civilization is a denial of it Read Walt
Whitman

LORD SUMMERHAYS I shall go to the billiard room and get the balls
for you

LINA Thank you

_Lord Summerhays goes out through the vestibule door_

TARLETON _going to her_ Listen to me _She turns quickly_
What you said just now was beautiful You touch chords You appeal
to the poetry in a man You inspire him Come now Youre a woman of
the world youre independent you must have driven lots of men
crazy You know the sort of man I am dont you See through me at a
glance eh

LINA Yes _She sits down quietly in the chair Lord Summerhays has
just left_

TARLETON Good Well do you like me Dont misunderstand me Im
perfectly aware that youre not going to fall in love at first sight
with a ridiculous old shopkeeper I cant help that ridiculous old
shopkeeper I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or
not I have to pay for his clothes though I hate the cut of them
especially the waistcoat I have to look at him in the glass while
Im shaving I loathe him because hes a living lie My souls not
like that its like yours I want to make a fool of myself About
you Will you let me

LINA _very calm_ How much will you pay

TARLETON Nothing But Ill throw as many sovereigns as you like
into the sea to shew you that Im in earnest

LINA Are those your usual terms

TARLETON No I never made that bid before

LINA _producing a dainty little book and preparing to write in it_
What did you say your name was

TARLETON John Tarleton The great John Tarleton of Tarletons
Underwear

LINA _writing_ Tarleton Er _She looks up at him
inquiringly_

TARLETON _promptly_ Fiftyeight

LINA Thank you I keep a list of all my offers I like to know
what Im considered worth

TARLETON Let me look

LINA _offering the book to him_ Its in Polish

TARLETON Thats no good Is mine the lowest offer

LINA No the highest

TARLETON What do most of them come to Diamonds Motor cars
Furs Villa at Monte Carlo

LINA Oh yes all that And sometimes the devotion of a lifetime

TARLETON Fancy that A young man offering a woman his old age as a
temptation

LINA By the way you did not say how long

TARLETON Until you get tired of me

LINA Or until you get tired of me

TARLETON I never get tired I never go on long enough for that
But when it becomes so grand so inspiring that I feel that everything
must be an anticlimax after that then I run away

LINA Does she let you go without a struggle

TARLETON Yes Glad to get rid of me When love takes a man as it
takes mewhen it makes him greatit frightens a woman

LINA The lady here is your wife isnt she Dont you care for her

TARLETON Yes And mind she comes first always I reserve her
dignity even when I sacrifice my own Youll respect that point of
honor wont you

LINA Only a point of honor

TARLETON _impulsively_ No by God a point of affection as well

LINA _smiling pleased with him_ Shake hands old pal _she rises
and offers him her hand frankly_

TARLETON _giving his hand rather dolefully_ Thanks That means
no doesnt it

LINA It means something that will last longer than yes I like you
I admit you to my friendship What a pity you were not trained when
you were young Youd be young still

TARLETON I suppose to an athlete like you Im pretty awful eh

LINA Shocking

TARLETON Too much crumb Wrinkles Yellow patches that wont come
off Short wind I know Im ashamed of myself I could do nothing
on the high rope

LINA Oh yes I could put you in a wheelbarrow and run you along
two hundred feet up

TARLETON _shuddering_ Ugh Well Id do even that for you Read
The Master Builder

LINA Have you learnt everything from books

TARLETON Well have you learnt everything from the flying trapeze

LINA On the flying trapeze there is often another woman and her
life is in your hands every night and your life in hers

TARLETON Lina Im going to make a fool of myself Im going to
cry _he crumples into the nearest chair_

LINA Pray instead dont cry Why should you cry Youre not the
first Ive said no to

TARLETON If you had said yes should I have been the first then

LINA What right have you to ask Have I asked am _I_ the first

TARLETON Youre right a vulgar question To a man like me
everybody is the first Life renews itself

LINA The youngest child is the sweetest

TARLETON Dont probe too deep Lina It hurts

LINA You must get out of the habit of thinking that these things
matter so much Its linendraperish

TARLETON Youre quite right Ive often said so All the same it
does matter for I want to cry _He buries his face in his arms on
the worktable and sobs_

LINA _going to him_ O la la _She slaps him vigorously but not
unkindly on the shoulder_ Courage old pal courage Have you a
gymnasium here

TARLETON Theres a trapeze and bars and things in the billiard room

LINA Come You need a few exercises Ill teach you how to stop
crying _She takes his arm and leads him off into the vestibule_

_A young man cheaply dressed and strange in manner appears in the
garden steals to the pavilion door and looks in Seeing that there
is nobody he enters cautiously until he has come far enough to see
into the hatstand corner He draws a revolver and examines it
apparently to make sure that it is loaded Then his attention is
caught by the Turkish bath He looks down the lunette and opens the
panels_

HYPATIA _calling in the garden_ Mr Percival Mr Percival Where
are you

_The young man makes for the door but sees Percival coming He turns
and bolts into the Turkish bath which he closes upon himself just in
time to escape being caught by Percival who runs in through the
pavilion bareheaded He also it appears is in search of a
hidingplace for he stops and turns between the two tables to take a
survey of the room then runs into the corner between the end of the
sideboard and the wall Hypatia excited mischievous her eyes
glowing runs in precisely on his trail turns at the same spot and
discovers him just as he makes a dash for the pavilion door She
flies back and intercepts him_

HYPATIA Aha arnt you glad Ive caught you

PERCIVAL _illhumoredly turning away from her and coming towards the
writing table_ No Im not Confound it what sort of girl are you
What sort of house is this Must I throw all good manners to the
winds

HYPATIA _following him_ Do do do do do This is the house of
a respectable shopkeeper enormously rich This is the respectable
shopkeepers daughter tired of good manners _Slipping her left
hand into his right_ Come handsome young man and play with the
respectable shopkeepers daughter

PERCIVAL _withdrawing quickly from her touch_ No no dont you
know you mustnt go on like this with a perfect stranger

HYPATIA Dropped down from the sky Dont you know that you must
always go on like this when you get the chance You must come to the
top of the hill and chase me through the bracken You may kiss me if
you catch me

PERCIVAL I shall do nothing of the sort

HYPATIA Yes you will you cant help yourself Come along _She
seizes his sleeve_ Fool fool come along Dont you want to

PERCIVAL No certainly not I should never be forgiven if I did
it

HYPATIA Youll never forgive yourself if you dont

PERCIVAL Nonsense Youre engaged to Ben Bens my friend What do
you take me for

HYPATIA Bens old Ben was born old Theyre all old here except
you and me and the manwoman or womanman or whatever you call her
that came with you They never do anything they only discuss
whether what other people do is right Come and give them something
to discuss

PERCIVAL I will do nothing incorrect

HYPATIA Oh dont be afraid little boy youll get nothing but a
kiss and Ill fight like the devil to keep you from getting that
But we must play on the hill and race through the heather

PERCIVAL Why

HYPATIA Because we want to handsome young man

PERCIVAL But if everybody went on in this way

HYPATIA How happy oh how happy the world would be

PERCIVAL But the consequences may be serious

HYPATIA Nothing is worth doing unless the consequences may be
serious My father says so and Im my fathers daughter

PERCIVAL Im the son of three fathers I mistrust these wild
impulses

HYPATIA Take care Youre letting the moment slip I feel the first
chill of the wave of prudence Save me

PERCIVAL Really Miss Tarleton _she strikes him across the face_
Damn you _Recovering himself horrified at his lapse_ I beg
your pardon but since weve both forgotten ourselves youll please
allow me to leave the house _He turns towards the inner door
having left his cap in the bedroom_

HYPATIA _standing in his way_ Are you ashamed of having said
Damn you to me

PERCIVAL I had no right to say it Im very much ashamed of it I
have already begged your pardon

HYPATIA And youre not ashamed of having said Really Miss
Tarleton

PERCIVAL Why should I

HYPATIA O man man mean stupid cowardly selfish masculine male
man You ought to have been a governess I was expelled from school
for saying that the very next person that said Really Miss
Tarleton to me I would strike her across the face You were the
next

PERCIVAL I had no intention of being offensive Surely there is
nothing that can wound any lady in_He hesitates not quite
convinced_ At leasterI really didnt mean to be disagreeable

HYPATIA Liar

PERCIVAL Of course if youre going to insult me I am quite helpless
Youre a woman you can say what you like

HYPATIA And you can only say what you dare Poor wretch it isnt
much _He bites his lip and sits down very much annoyed_
Really Mr Percival You sit down in the presence of a lady and leave
her standing _He rises hastily_ Ha ha Really Mr Percival
Oh really really really really really Mr Percival How do you
like it Wouldnt you rather I damned you

PERCIVAL Miss Tarleton

HYPATIA _caressingly_ Hypatia Joey Patsy if you like

PERCIVAL Look here this is no good You want to do what you like

HYPATIA Dont you

PERCIVAL No Ive been too well brought up Ive argued all through
this thing and I tell you Im not prepared to cast off the social
bond Its like a corset its a support to the figure even if it
does squeeze and deform it a bit I want to be free

HYPATIA Well Im tempting you to be free

PERCIVAL Not at all Freedom my good girl means being able to
count on how other people will behave If every man who dislikes me
is to throw a handful of mud in my face and every woman who likes me
is to behave like Potiphars wife then I shall be a slave the slave
of uncertainty the slave of fear the worst of all slaveries How
would you like it if every laborer you met in the road were to make
love to you No Give me the blessed protection of a good stiff
conventionality among thoroughly wellbrought up ladies and gentlemen

HYPATIA Another talker Men like conventions because men made them
I didnt make them I dont like them I wont keep them Now what
will you do

PERCIVAL Bolt _He runs out through the pavilion_

HYPATIA Ill catch you _She dashes off in pursuit_

_During this conversation the head of the scandalized man in the
Turkish bath has repeatedly risen from the lunette with a strong
expression of moral shock It vanishes abruptly as the two turn
towards it in their flight At the same moment Tarleton comes back
through the vestibule door exhausted by severe and unaccustomed
exercise_

TARLETON _looking after the flying figures with amazement_ Hallo
Patsy whats up Another aeroplane _They are far too preoccupied
to hear him and he is left staring after them as they rush away
through the garden He goes to the pavilion door and looks up but
the heavens are empty His exhaustion disables him from further
inquiry He dabs his brow with his handkerchief and walks stiffly to
the nearest convenient support which happens to be the Turkish bath
He props himself upon it with his elbow and covers his eyes with his
hand for a moment After a few sighing breaths he feels a little
better and uncovers his eyes The mans head rises from the lunette
a few inches from his nose He recoils from the bath with a violent
start_ Oh Lord My brains gone _Calling piteously_
Chickabiddy _He staggers down to the writing table_

THE MAN _coming out of the bath pistol in hand_ Another sound
and youre a dead man

TARLETON _braced_ Am I Well youre a live one thats one
comfort I thought you were a ghost _He sits down quite
undisturbed by the pistol_ Who are you and what the devil were you
doing in my new Turkish bath

THE MAN _with tragic intensity_ I am the son of Lucinda Titmus

TARLETON _the name conveying nothing to him_ Indeed And how is
she Quite well I hope eh

THE MAN She is dead Dead my God and youre alive

TARLETON _unimpressed by the tragedy but sympathetic_ Oh Lost
your mother Thats sad Im sorry But we cant all have the luck to
survive our mothers and be nursed out of the world by the hands that
nursed us into it

THE MAN Much you care damn you

TARLETON Oh dont cut up rough Face it like a man You see I
didnt know your mother but Ive no doubt she was an excellent woman

THE MAN Not know her Do you dare to stand there by her open grave
and deny that you knew her

TARLETON _trying to recollect_ What did you say her name was

THE MAN Lucinda Titmus

TARLETON Well I ought to remember a rum name like that if I ever
heard it But I dont Have you a photograph or anything

THE MAN Forgotten even the name of your victim

TARLETON Oh she was my victim was she

THE MAN She was And you shall see her face again before you die
dead as she is I have a photograph

TARLETON Good

THE MAN Ive two photographs

TARLETON Still better Treasure the mothers pictures Good boy

THE MAN One of them as you knew her The other as she became when
you flung her aside and she withered into an old woman

TARLETON Shed have done that anyhow my lad We all grow old
Look at me _Seeing that the man is embarrassed by his pistol in
fumbling for the photographs with his left hand in his breast pocket_
Let me hold the gun for you

THE MAN _retreating to the worktable_ Stand back Do you take me
for a fool

TARLETON Well youre a little upset naturally It does you credit

THE MAN Look here upon this picture and on this _He holds out
the two photographs like a hand at cards and points to them with the
pistol_

TARLETON Good Read Shakespear he has a word for every occasion
_He takes the photographs one in each hand and looks from one to
the other pleased and interested but without any sign of
recognition_ What a pretty girl Very pretty I can imagine myself
falling in love with her when I was your age I wasnt a badlooking
young fellow myself in those days _Looking at the other_ Curious
that we should both have gone the same way

THE MAN You and she the same way What do you mean

TARLETON Both got stout I mean

THE MAN Would you have had her deny herself food

TARLETON No it wouldnt have been any use Its constitutional
No matter how little you eat you put on flesh if youre made that way
_He resumes his study of the earlier photograph_

THE MAN Is that all the feeling that rises in you at the sight of
the face you once knew so well

TARLETON _too much absorbed in the portrait to heed him_ Funny
that I cant remember Let this be a lesson to you young man I
could go into court tomorrow and swear I never saw that face before in
my life if it wasnt for that brooch _pointing to the photograph_
Have you got that brooch by the way _The man again resorts to his
breast pocket_ You seem to carry the whole family property in that
pocket

THE MAN _producing a brooch_ Here it is to prove my bona fides

TARLETON _pensively putting the photographs on the table and taking
the brooch_ I bought that brooch in Cheapside from a man with a
yellow wig and a cast in his left eye Ive never set eyes on him from
that day to this And yet I remember that man and I cant remember
your mother

THE MAN Monster Without conscience without even memory You left
her to her shame

TARLETON _throwing the brooch on the table and rising pepperily_
Come come young man none of that Respect the romance of your
mothers youth Dont you start throwing stones at her I dont recall
her features just at this moment but Ive no doubt she was kind to me
and we were happy together If you have a word to say against her
take yourself out of my house and say it elsewhere

THE MAN What sort of a joker are you Are you trying to put me in
the wrong when you have to answer to me for a crime that would make
every honest man spit at you as you passed in the street if I were to
make it known

TARLETON You read a good deal dont you

THE MAN What if I do What has that to do with your infamy and my
mothers doom

TARLETON There you see Doom Thats not good sense but its
literature Now it happens that Im a tremendous reader always was
When I was your age I read books of that sort by the bushel the Doom
sort you know Its odd isnt it that you and I should be like one
another in that respect Can you account for it in any way

THE MAN No What are you driving at

TARLETON Well do you know who your father was

THE MAN I see what you mean now You dare set up to be my father
Thank heaven Ive not a drop of your vile blood in my veins

TARLETON _sitting down again with a shrug_ Well if you wont be
civil theres no pleasure in talking to you is there What do you
want Money

THE MAN How dare you insult me

TARLETON Well what do you want

THE MAN Justice

TARLETON Youre quite sure thats all

THE MAN Its enough for me

TARLETON A modest sort of demand isnt it Nobody ever had it since
the world began fortunately for themselves but you must have it
must you Well youve come to the wrong shop for it youll get no
justice here we dont keep it Human nature is what we stock

THE MAN Human nature Debauchery gluttony selfishness robbery of
the poor Is that what you call human nature

TARLETON No thats what you call it Come my lad Whats the
matter with you You dont look starved and youve a decent suit of
clothes

THE MAN Fortytwo shillings

TARLETON They can do you a very decent suit for fortytwo shillings
Have you paid for it

THE MAN Do you take me for a thief And do you suppose I can get
credit like you

TARLETON Then you were able to lay your hand on fortytwo shillings
Judging from your conversational style I should think you must spend
at least a shilling a week on romantic literature

THE MAN Where would I get a shilling a week to spend on books when I
can hardly keep myself decent I get books at the Free Library

TARLETON _springing to his feet_ What

THE MAN _recoiling before his vehemence_ The Free Library
Theres no harm in that

TARLETON Ingrate I supply you with free books and the use you
make of them is to persuade yourself that its a fine thing to shoot
me _He throws himself doggedly back into his chair_ Ill never
give another penny to a Free Library

THE MAN Youll never give another penny to anything This is the
end for you and me

TARLETON Pooh Come come man talk business Whats wrong Are
you out of employment

THE MAN No This is my Saturday afternoon Dont flatter yourself
that Im a loafer or a criminal Im a cashier and I defy you to say
that my cash has ever been a farthing wrong Ive a right to call you
to account because my hands are clean

TARLETON Well call away What have I to account for Had you a
hard time with your mother Why didnt she ask me for money

THE MAN Shed have died first Besides who wanted your money Do
you suppose we lived in the gutter My father maynt have been in as
large a way as you but he was better connected and his shop was as
respectable as yours

TARLETON I suppose your mother brought him a little capital

THE MAN I dont know Whats that got to do with you

TARLETON Well you say she and I knew one another and parted She
must have had something off me then you know One doesnt get out of
these things for nothing Hang it young man do you suppose Ive no
heart Of course she had her due and she found a husband with it
and set him up in business with it and brought you up respectably so
what the devil have you to complain of

THE MAN Are women to be ruined with impunity

TARLETON I havnt ruined any woman that Im aware of Ive been the
making of you and your mother

THE MAN Oh Im a fool to listen to you and argue with you I came
here to kill you and then kill myself

TARLETON Begin with yourself if you dont mind Ive a good deal of
business to do still before I die Havnt you

THE MAN No Thats just it Ive no business to do Do you know
what my life is I spend my days from nine to sixnine hours of
daylight and fresh airin a stuffy little den counting another mans
money Ive an intellect a mind and a brain and a soul and the use
he makes of them is to fix them on his tuppences and his
eighteenpences and his two pound seventeen and tenpences and see how
much they come to at the end of the day and take care that no one
steals them I enter and enter and add and add and take money and
give change and fill cheques and stamp receipts and not a penny of
that money is my own not one of those transactions has the smallest
interest for me or anyone else in the world but him and even he
couldnt stand it if he had to do it all himself And Im envied
aye envied for the variety and liveliness of my job by the poor
devil of a bookkeeper that has to copy all my entries over again
Fifty thousand entries a year that poor wretch makes and not ten out
of the fifty thousand ever has to be referred to again and when all
the figures are counted up and the balance sheet made out the boss
isnt a penny the richer than hed be if bookkeeping had never been
invented Of all the damnable waste of human life that ever was
invented clerking is the very worst

TARLETON Why not join the territorials

THE MAN Because I shouldnt be let He hasnt even the sense to see
that it would pay him to get some cheap soldiering out of me How can
a man tied to a desk from nine to six be anythingbe even a man let
alone a soldier But Ill teach him and you a lesson Ive had enough
of living a dogs life and despising myself for it Ive had enough of
being talked down to by hogs like you and wearing my life out for a
salary that wouldnt keep you in cigars Youll never believe that a
clerks a man until one of us makes an example of one of you

TARLETON Despotism tempered by assassination eh

THE MAN Yes Thats what they do in Russia Well a business office
is Russia as far as the clerks are concerned So dont you take it so
coolly You think Im not going to do it but I am

TARLETON _rising and facing him_ Come now as man to man Its
not my fault that youre poorer than I am and its not your fault that
Im richer than you And if you could undo all that passed between me
and your mother you wouldnt undo it and neither would she But
youre sick of your slavery and you want to be the hero of a romance
and to get into the papers Eh A son revenges his mothers shame
Villain weltering in his gore Mother look down from heaven and
receive your unhappy sons last sigh

THE MAN Oh rot do you think I read novelettes And do you suppose
I believe such superstitions as heaven I go to church because the
boss told me Id get the sack if I didnt Free England Ha _Lina
appears at the pavilion door and comes swiftly and noiselessly
forward on seeing the man with a pistol in his hand_

TARLETON Youre afraid of getting the sack but youre not afraid to
shoot yourself

THE MAN Damn you youre trying to keep me talking until somebody
comes _He raises the pistol desperately but not very resolutely_

LINA _at his right elbow_ Somebody has come

THE MAN _turning on her_ Stand off Ill shoot you if you lay a
hand on me I will by God

LINA You cant cover me with that pistol Try

_He tries presenting the pistol at her face She moves round him in
the opposite direction to the hands of a clock with a light dancing
step He finds it impossible to cover her with the pistol she is
always too far to his left Tarleton behind him grips his wrist and
drags his arm straight up so that the pistol points to the ceiling
As he tries to turn on his assailant Lina grips his other wrist_

LINA Please stop I cant bear to twist anyones wrist but I must
if you dont let the pistol go

THE MAN _letting Tarleton take it from him_ All right Im done
Couldnt even do that job decently Thats a clerk all over Very
well send for your damned police and make an end of it Im
accustomed to prison from nine to six I daresay I can stand it from
six to nine as well

TARLETON Dont swear Thats a lady _He throws the pistol on the
writing table_

THE MAN _looking at Lina in amazement_ Beaten by a female It
needed only this _He collapses in the chair near the worktable and
hides his face They cannot help pitying him_

LINA Old pal dont call the police Lend him a bicycle and let him
get away

THE MAN I cant ride a bicycle I never could afford one Im not
even that much good

TARLETON If I gave you a hundred pound note now to go and have a
good spree with I wonder would you know how to set about it Do you
ever take a holiday

THE MAN Take I got four days last August

TARLETON What did you do

THE MAN I did a cheap trip to Folkestone I spent sevenpence on
dropping pennies into silly automatic machines and peepshows of rowdy
girls having a jolly time I spent a penny on the lift and fourpence
on refreshments That cleaned me out The rest of the time I was so
miserable that I was glad to get back to the office Now you know

LINA Come to the gymnasium Ill teach you how to make a man of
yourself _The man is about to rise irresolutely from the mere
habit of doing what he is told when Tarleton stops him_

TARLETON Young man dont Youve tried to shoot me but Im not
vindictive I draw the line at putting a man on the rack If you
want every joint in your body stretched until its an agony to
liveuntil you have an unnatural feeling that all your muscles are
singing and laughing with painthen go to the gymnasium with that
lady But youll be more comfortable in jail

LINA _greatly amused_ Was that why you went away old pal Was
that the telegram you said you had forgotten to send

_Mrs Tarleton comes in hastily through the inner door_

MRS TARLETON _on the steps_ Is anything the matter John Nurse
says she heard you calling me a quarter of an hour ago and that your
voice sounded as if you were ill _She comes between Tarleton and
the man_ Is anything the matter

TARLETON This is the son of an old friend of mine MrerMr
Gunner _To the man who rises awkwardly_ My wife

MRS TARLETON Good evening to you

GUNNER Er _He is too nervous to speak and makes a shambling
bow_

_Bentley looks in at the pavilion door very peevish and too
preoccupied with his own affairs to pay any attention to those of the
company_

BENTLEY I say has anybody seen Hypatia She promised to come out
with me and I cant find her anywhere And wheres Joey

GUNNER _suddenly breaking out aggressively being incapable of any
middle way between submissiveness and violence_ _I_ can tell you
where Hypatia is I can tell you where Joey is And I say its a
scandal and an infamy If people only knew what goes on in this
socalled respectable house it would be put a stop to These are the
morals of our pious capitalist class This is your rotten
bourgeoisie This

MRS TARLETON Dont you dare use such language in company I wont
allow it

TARLETON All right Chickabiddy its not bad language its only
Socialism

MRS TARLETON Well I wont have any Socialism in my house

TARLETON _to Gunner_ You hear what Mrs Tarleton says Well in
this house everybody does what she says or out they go

GUNNER Do you suppose I want to stay Do you think I would breathe
this polluted atmosphere a moment longer than I could help

BENTLEY _running forward between Lina and Gunner_ But what did
you mean by what you said about Miss Tarleton and Mr Percival you
beastly rotter you

GUNNER _to Tarleton_ Oh is Hypatia your daughter And Joey is
Mister Percival is he One of your set I suppose One of the smart
set One of the bridgeplaying eightyhorsepower weekender set
One of the johnnies I slave for Well Joey has more decency than
your daughter anyhow The women are the worst I never believed it
til I saw it with my own eyes Well it wont last for ever The
writing is on the wall Rome fell Babylon fell Hindheads turn
will come

MRS TARLETON _naively looking at the wall for the writing_
Whatever are you talking about young man

GUNNER I know what Im talking about I went into that Turkish bath
a boy I came out a man

MRS TARLETON Good gracious hes mad _To Lina_ Did John make him
take a Turkish bath

LINA No He doesnt need Turkish baths he needs to put on a little
flesh I dont understand what its all about I found him trying to
shoot Mr Tarleton

MRS TARLETON _with a scream_ Oh and John encouraging him Ill
be bound Bunny you go for the police _To Gunner_ Ill teach
you to come into my house and shoot my husband

GUNNER Teach away I never asked to be let off Im ashamed to be
free instead of taking my part with the rest Womenbeautiful women
of noble birthare going to prison for their opinions Girl students
in Russia go to the gallows let themselves be cut in pieces with the
knout or driven through the frozen snows of Siberia sooner than
stand looking on tamely at the world being made a hell for the toiling
millions If you were not all skunks and cowards youd be suffering
with them instead of battening here on the plunder of the poor

MRS TARLETON _much vexed_ Oh did you ever hear such silly
nonsense Bunny go and tell the gardener to send over one of his
men to Grayshott for the police

GUNNER Ill go with him I intend to give myself up Im going to
expose what Ive seen here no matter what the consequences may be to
my miserable self

TARLETON Stop You stay where you are Ben Chickabiddy youve
never had the police in If you had youd not be in a hurry to have
them in again Now young man cut the cackle and tell us as short
as you can what did you see

GUNNER I cant tell you in the presence of ladies

MRS TARLETON Oh you are tiresome As if it mattered to anyone what
you saw Me A married woman that might be your mother _To Lina_
And Im sure youre not particular if youll excuse my saying so

TARLETON Out with it What did you see

GUNNER I saw your daughter with my own eyesoh well never mind
what I saw

BENTLEY _almost crying with anxiety_ You beastly rotter Ill get
Joey to give you such a hiding

TARLETON You cant leave it at that you know What did you see my
daughter doing

GUNNER After all why shouldnt she do it The Russian students do
it Women should be as free as men Im a fool Im so full of your
bourgeois morality that I let myself be shocked by the application of
my own revolutionary principles If she likes the man why shouldnt
she tell him so

MRS TARLETON I do wonder at you John letting him talk like this
before everybody _Turning rather tartly to Lina_ Would you mind
going away to the drawingroom just for a few minutes Miss
Chipenoska This is a private family matter if you dont mind

LINA I should have gone before Mrs Tarleton if there had been
anyone to protect Mr Tarleton and the young gentleman

TARLETON Youre quite right Miss Lina you must stand by I could
have tackled him this morning but since you put me through those
exercises Id rather die than even shake hands with a man much less
fight him

GUNNER Its all of a piece here The men effeminate the women
unsexed

TARLETON Dont begin again old chap Keep it for Trafalgar Square

HYPATIAS VOICE OUTSIDE No no _She breaks off in a stifled half
laugh half scream and is seen darting across the garden with
Percival in hot pursuit Immediately afterwards she appears again
and runs into the pavilion Finding it full of people including a
stranger she stops but Percival flushed and reckless rushes in and
seizes her before he too realizes that they are not alone He
releases her in confusion_

_Dead silence They are all afraid to look at one another except Mrs
Tarleton who stares sternly at Hypatia Hypatia is the first to
recover her presence of mind_

HYPATIA Excuse me rushing in like this Mr Percival has been
chasing me down the hill

GUNNER Who chased him up it Dont be ashamed Be fearless Be
truthful

TARLETON Gunner will you go to Paris for a fortnight Ill pay
your expenses

HYPATIA What do you mean

GUNNER There was a silent witness in the Turkish bath

TARLETON I found him hiding there Whatever went on here he saw
and heard Thats what he means

PERCIVAL _sternly approaching Gunner and speaking with deep but
contained indignation_ Am I to understand you as daring to put
forward the monstrous and blackguardly lie that this lady behaved
improperly in my presence

GUNNER _turning white_ You know what I saw and heard

_Hypatia with a gleam of triumph in her eyes slips noiselessly into
the swing chair and watches Percival and Gunner swinging slightly
but otherwise motionless_

PERCIVAL I hope it is not necessary for me to assure you all that
there is not one word of truthnot one grain of substancein this
rascally calumny which no man with a spark of decent feeling would
have uttered even if he had been ignorant enough to believe it Miss
Tarletons conduct since I have had the honor of knowing her has
been I need hardly say in every respect beyond reproach _To
Gunner_ As for you sir youll have the goodness to come out with me
immediately I have some business with you which cant be settled in
Mrs Tarletons presence or in her house

GUNNER _painfully frightened_ Why should I go out with you

PERCIVAL Because I intend that you shall

GUNNER I wont be bullied by you _Percival makes a threatening
step towards him_ Police _He tries to bolt but Percival seizes
him_ Leave me go will you What right have you to lay hands on
me

TARLETON Let him run for it Mr Percival Hes very poor company
We shall be well rid of him Let him go

PERCIVAL Not until he has taken back and made the fullest apology
for the abominable lie he has told He shall do that or he shall
defend himself as best he can against the most thorough thrashing Im
capable of giving him _Releasing Gunner but facing him ominously_
Take your choice Which is it to be

GUNNER Give me a fair chance Go and stick at a desk from nine to
six for a month and let me have your grub and your sport and your
lessons in boxing and Ill fight you fast enough You know Im no
good or you darent bully me like this

PERCIVAL You should have thought of that before you attacked a lady
with a dastardly slander Im waiting for your decision Im rather
in a hurry please

GUNNER I never said anything against the lady

MRS TARLETON  Oh listen to that
 
BENTLEY  What a liar
 
HYPATIA  Oh
 
TARLETON  Oh come

PERCIVAL Well have it in writing if you dont mind _Pointing to
the writing table_ Sit down and take that pen in your hand
_Gunner looks irresolutely a little way round then obeys_ Now
write I whatever your name is

GUNNER _after a vain attempt_ I cant My hands shaking too much
You see its no use Im doing my best I cant

PERCIVAL Mr Summerhays will write it you can sign it

BENTLEY _insolently to Gunner_ Get up _Gunner obeys and
Bentley shouldering him aside towards Percival takes his place and
prepares to write_

PERCIVAL Whats your name

GUNNER John Brown

TARLETON Oh come Couldnt you make it Horace Smith or Algernon
Robinson

GUNNER _agitatedly_ But my name is John Brown There are really
John Browns How can I help it if my names a common one

BENTLEY Shew us a letter addressed to you

GUNNER How can I I never get any letters Im only a clerk I
can shew you J B on my handkerchief _He takes out a not very
clean one_

BENTLEY _with disgust_ Oh put it up again Let it go at John
Brown

PERCIVAL Where do you live

GUNNER 4 Chesterfield Parade Kentish Town NW

PERCIVAL _dictating_ I John Brown of 4 Chesterfield Parade
Kentish Town do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st May 1909
I _To Tarleton_ What did he do exactly

TARLETON _dictating_ I trespassed on the land of John Tarleton
at Hindhead and effected an unlawful entry into his house where I
secreted myself in a portable Turkish bath

BENTLEY Go slow old man Just a moment Turkish bathyes

TARLETON _continuing_ with a pistol with which I threatened to
take the life of the said John Tarleton

MRS TARLETON Oh John You might have been killed

TARLETON and was prevented from doing so only by the timely
arrival of the celebrated Miss Lina Szczepanowska

MRS TARLETON Is she celebrated _Apologetically_ I never
dreamt

BENTLEY Look here Im awfully sorry but I cant spell
Szczepanowska

PERCIVAL I think its S z c z _Lina gives him her
visitingcard_ Thank you _He throws it on Bentleys blotter_

BENTLEY Thanks awfully _He writes the name_

TARLETON _to Percival_ Now its your turn

PERCIVAL _dictating_ I further confess that I was guilty of
uttering an abominable calumny concerning Miss Hypatia Tarleton for
which there was not a shred of foundation

_Impressive silence whilst Bentley writes_

BENTLEY foundation

PERCIVAL I apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my
conduct _he waits for Bentley to write_

BENTLEY conduct

PERCIVAL and I promise Mr Tarleton not to repeat it and to amend
my life

BENTLEY amend my life

PERCIVAL and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness
in giving me another chance

BENTLEY another chance

PERCIVAL and refraining from delivering me up to the punishment I
so richly deserve

BENTLEY richly deserve

PERCIVAL _to Hypatia_ Does that satisfy you Miss Tarleton

HYPATIA Yes that will teach him to tell lies next time

BENTLEY _rising to make place for Gunner and handing him the pen_
You mean it will teach him to tell the truth next time

TARLETON Ahem Do you Patsy

PERCIVAL Be good enough to sign _Gunner sits down helplessly and
dips the pen in the ink_ I hope what you are signing is no mere
form of words to you and that you not only say you are sorry but
that you are sorry

_Lord Summerhays and Johnny come in through the pavilion door_

MRS TARLETON Stop Mr Percival I think on Hypatias account
Lord Summerhays ought to be told about this

_Lord Summerhays wondering what the matter is comes forward between
Percival and Lina Johnny stops beside Hypatia_

PERCIVAL Certainly

TARLETON _uneasily_ Take my advice and cut it short Get rid of
him

MRS TARLETON Hypatia ought to have her character cleared

TARLETON You let well alone Chickabiddy Most of our characters
will bear a little careful dusting but they wont bear scouring
Patsy is jolly well out of it What does it matter anyhow

PERCIVAL Mr Tarleton we have already said either too much or not
enough Lord Summerhays will you be kind enough to witness the
declaration this man has just signed

GUNNER I havnt yet Am I to sign now

PERCIVAL Of course _Gunner who is now incapable of doing
anything on his own initiative signs_ Now stand up and read your
declaration to this gentleman _Gunner makes a vague movement and
looks stupidly round Percival adds peremptorily_ Now please

GUNNER _rising apprehensively and reading in a hardly audible voice
like a very sick man_ I John Brown of 4 Chesterfield Parade
Kentish Town do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st May 1909
I trespassed on the land of John Tarleton at Hindhead and effected an
unlawful entry into his house where I secreted myself in a portable
Turkish bath with a pistol with which I threatened to take the life
of the said John Tarleton and was prevented from doing so only by the
timely arrival of the celebrated Miss Lena ShShsheepanossika I
further confess that I was guilty of uttering an abominable calumny
concerning Miss Hypatia Tarleton for which there was not a shred of
foundation I apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my
conduct and I promise Mr Tarleton not to repeat it and to amend my
life and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness in
giving me another chance and refraining from delivering me up to the
punishment I so richly deserve

_A short and painful silence follows Then Percival speaks_

PERCIVAL Do you consider that sufficient Lord Summerhays

LORD SUMMERHAYS Oh quite quite

PERCIVAL _to Hypatia_ Lord Summerhays would probably like to hear
you say that you are satisfied Miss Tarleton

HYPATIA _coming out of the swing and advancing between Percival
and Lord Summerhays_ I must say that you have behaved like a perfect
gentleman Mr Percival

PERCIVAL _first bowing to Hypatia and then turning with cold
contempt to Gunner who is standing helpless_ We need not trouble
you any further _Gunner turns vaguely towards the pavilion_

JOHNNY _with less refined offensiveness pointing to the pavilion_
Thats your way The gardener will shew you the shortest way into the
road Go the shortest way

GUNNER _oppressed and disconcerted hardly knows how to get out of
the room_ Yes sir I _He turns again appealing to Tarleton_
Maynt I have my mothers photographs back again _Mrs Tarleton
pricks up her ears_

TARLETON Eh What Oh the photographs Yes yes yes take
them _Gunner takes them from the table and is creeping away when
Mrs Tarleton puts out her hand and stops him_

MRS TARLETON Whats this John What were you doing with his
mothers photographs

TARLETON Nothing nothing Never mind Chickabiddy its all
right

MRS TARLETON _snatching the photographs from Gunners irresolute
fingers and recognizing them at a glance_ Lucy Titmus Oh John
John

TARLETON _grimly to Gunner_ Young man youre a fool but youve
just put the lid on this job in a masterly manner I knew you would
I told you all to let well alone You wouldnt and now you must take
the consequencesor rather _I_ must take them

MRS TARLETON _to Gunner_ Are you Lucys son

GUNNER Yes

MRS TARLETON And why didnt you come to me I didnt turn my back on
your mother when she came to me in her trouble Didnt you know that

GUNNER No She never talked to me about anything

TARLETON How could she talk to her own son Shy Summerhays shy
Parent and child Shy _He sits down at the end of the writing
table nearest the sideboard like a man resigned to anything that fate
may have in store for him_

MRS TARLETON Then how did you find out

GUNNER From her papers after she died

MRS TARLETON _shocked_ Is Lucy dead And I never knew _With
an effusion of tenderness_ And you here being treated like that
poor orphan with nobody to take your part Tear up that foolish
paper child and sit down and make friends with me

JOHNNY  Hallo mother this is all very well you know
 
PERCIVAL  But may I point out Mrs Tarleton that
 
BENTLEY  Do you mean that after what he said of
 
HYPATIA  Oh look here mamma this is really

MRS TARLETON Will you please speak one at a time

_Silence_

PERCIVAL _in a very gentlemanly manner_ Will you allow me to remind
you Mrs Tarleton that this man has uttered a most serious and
disgraceful falsehood concerning Miss Tarleton and myself

MRS TARLETON I dont believe a word of it If the poor lad was there
in the Turkish bath who has a better right to say what was going on
here than he has You ought to be ashamed of yourself Patsy and so
ought you too Mr Percival for encouraging her _Hypatia retreats
to the pavilion and exchanges grimaces with Johnny shamelessly
enjoying Percivals sudden reverse They know their mother_

PERCIVAL _gasping_ Mrs Tarleton I give you my word of honor

MRS TARLETON Oh go along with you and your word of honor Do you
think Im a fool I wonder you can look the lad in the face after
bullying him and making him sign those wicked lies and all the time
you carrying on with my daughter before youd been half an hour in my
house Fie for shame

PERCIVAL Lord Summerhays I appeal to you Have I done the correct
thing or not

LORD SUMMERHAYS Youve done your best Mr Percival But the correct
thing depends for its success on everybody playing the game very
strictly As a singlehanded game its impossible

BENTLEY _suddenly breaking out lamentably_ Joey have you taken
Hypatia away from me

LORD SUMMERHAYS _severely_ Bentley Bentley Control yourself
sir

TARLETON Come Mr Percival the shutters are up on the gentlemanly
business Try the truth

PERCIVAL I am in a wretched position If I tell the truth nobody
will believe me

TARLETON Oh yes they will The truth makes everybody believe it

PERCIVAL It also makes everybody pretend not to believe it Mrs
Tarleton youre not playing the game

MRS TARLETON I dont think youve behaved at all nicely Mr Percival

BENTLEY I wouldnt have played you such a dirty trick Joey
_Struggling with a sob_ You beast

LORD SUMMERHAYS Bentley you must control yourself Let me say at
the same time Mr Percival that my son seems to have been mistaken in
regarding you either as his friend or as a gentleman

PERCIVAL Miss Tarleton Im suffering this for your sake I ask
you just to say that I am not to blame Just that and nothing more

HYPATIA _gloating mischievously over his distress_ You chased me
through the heather and kissed me You shouldnt have done that if you
were not in earnest

PERCIVAL Oh this is really the limit _Turning desperately to
Gunner_ Sir I appeal to you As a gentleman as a man of honor
as a man bound to stand by another man You were in that Turkish
bath You saw how it began Could any man have behaved more
correctly than I did Is there a shadow of foundation for the
accusations brought against me

GUNNER _sorely perplexed_ Well what do you want me to say

JOHNNY He has said what he had to say already hasnt he Read that
paper

GUNNER When I tell the truth you make me go back on it And now
you want me to go back on myself What is a man to do

PERCIVAL _patiently_ Please try to get your mind clear Mr Brown
I pointed out to you that you could not as a gentleman disparage a
ladys character You agree with me I hope

GUNNER Yes that sounds all right

PERCIVAL But youre also bound to tell the truth Surely youll not
deny that

GUNNER Whos denying it I say nothing against it

PERCIVAL Of course not Well I ask you to tell the truth simply
and unaffectedly Did you witness any improper conduct on my part
when you were in the bath

GUNNER No sir

JOHNNY  Then what do you mean by saying that
 
HYPATIA  Do you mean to say that I
 
BENTLEY  Oh you are a rotter Youre afraid

TARLETON _rising_ Stop _Silence_ Leave it at that Enough
said You keep quiet Johnny Mr Percival youre whitewashed So
are you Patsy Honors are easy Lets drop the subject The next
thing to do is to open a subscription to start this young man on a
ranch in some far country thats accustomed to be in a disturbed state
He

MRS TARLETON Now stop joking the poor lad John I wont have it
Has been worried to death between you all _To Gunner_ Have you
had your tea

GUNNER Tea No its too early Im all right only I had no
dinner I didnt think Id want it I didnt think Id be alive

MRS TARLETON Oh what a thing to say You mustnt talk like that

JOHNNY Hes out of his mind He thinks its past dinnertime

MRS TARLETON Oh youve no sense Johnny He calls his lunch his
dinner and has his tea at halfpast six Havnt you dear

GUNNER _timidly_ Hasnt everybody

JOHNNY _laughing_ Well by George thats not bad

MRS TARLETON Now dont be rude Johnny you know I dont like it
_To Gunner_ A cup of tea will pick you up

GUNNER Id rather not Im all right

TARLETON _going to the sideboard_ Here try a mouthful of sloe
gin

GUNNER No thanks Im a teetotaler I cant touch alcohol in any
form

TARLETON Nonsense This isnt alcohol Sloe gin Vegetarian you
know

GUNNER _hesitating_ Is it a fruit beverage

TARLETON Of course it is Fruit beverage Here you are _He
gives him a glass of sloe gin_

GUNNER _going to the sideboard_ Thanks _he begins to drink it
confidently but the first mouthful startles and almost chokes him_
Its rather hot

TARLETON Do you good Dont be afraid of it

MRS TARLETON _going to him_ Sip it dear Dont be in a hurry

_Gunner sips slowly each sip making his eyes water_

JOHNNY _coming forward into the place left vacant by Gunners visit
to the sideboard_ Well now that the gentleman has been attended to
I should like to know where we are It may be a vulgar business
habit but I confess I like to know where I am

TARLETON I dont Wherever you are youre there anyhow I tell you
again leave it at that

BENTLEY I want to know too Hypatias engaged to me

HYPATIA Bentley if you insult me againif you say another word
Ill leave the house and not enter it until you leave it

JOHNNY Put that in your pipe and smoke it my boy

BENTLEY _inarticulate with fury and suppressed tears_ Oh
Beasts Brutes

MRS TARLETON Now dont hurt his feelings poor little lamb

LORD SUMMERHAYS _very sternly_ Bentley you are not behaving
well You had better leave us until you have recovered yourself

_Bentley goes out in disgrace but gets no further than half way to
the pavilion door when with a wild sob he throws himself on the
floor and begins to yell_

MRS TARLETON  _running to him_ Oh poor child
  poor child Dont cry duckie
  he didnt mean it dont cry
 
LORD SUMMERHAYS Stop that infernal noise sir do you
  hear Stop it instantly
 
JOHNNY  Thats the game he tried on me
  There you are Now mother
  Now Patsy You see for yourselves
 
HYPATIA  _covering her ears_ Oh you little
  wretch Stop him Mr Percival Kick him
 
TARLETON  Steady on steady on Easy Bunny easy

LINA Leave him to me Mrs Tarleton Stand clear please

_She kneels opposite Bentley quickly lifts the upper half of him from
the ground dives under him rises with his body hanging across her
shoulders and runs out with him_

BENTLEY _in scared sobered humble tones as he is borne off_
What are you doing Let me down Please Miss Szczepanowska
_they pass out of hearing_

_An awestruck silence falls on the company as they speculate on
Bentleys fate_

JOHNNY I wonder what shes going to do with him

HYPATIA Spank him I hope Spank him hard

LORD SUMMERHAYS I hope so I hope so Tarleton Im beyond
measure humiliated and annoyed by my sons behavior in your house I
had better take him home

TARLETON Not at all not at all Now Chickabiddy as Miss Lina
has taken away Ben suppose you take away Mr Brown for a while

GUNNER _with unexpected aggressiveness_ My name isnt Brown
_They stare at him he meets their stare defiantly pugnacious with
sloe gin drains the last drop from his glass throws it on the
sideboard and advances to the writing table_ My names Baker
Julius Baker Mister Baker If any man doubts it Im ready for him

MRS TARLETON John you shouldnt have given him that sloe gin Its
gone to his head

GUNNER Dont you think it Fruit beverages dont go to the head and
what matter if they did I say nothing to you maam I regard you
with respect and affection _Lachrymosely_ You were very good to
my mother my poor mother _Relapsing into his daring mood_ But I
say my names Baker and Im not to be treated as a child or made a
slave of by any man Baker is my name Did you think I was going to
give you my real name Not likely Not me

TARLETON So you thought of John Brown That was clever of you

GUNNER Clever Yes were not all such fools as you think we
clerks It was the bookkeeper put me up to that Its the only name
that nobody gives as a false name he said Clever eh I should
think so

MRS TARLETON Come now Julius

GUNNER _reassuring her gravely_ Dont you be alarmed maam I
know what is due to you as a lady and to myself as a gentleman I
regard you with respect and affection If you had been my mother as
you ought to have been I should have had more chance But you shall
have no cause to be ashamed of me The strength of a chain is no
greater than its weakest link but the greatness of a poet is the
greatness of his greatest moment Shakespear used to get drunk
Frederick the Great ran away from a battle But it was what they
could rise to not what they could sink to that made them great
They werent good always but they were good on their day Well on my
dayon my day mind youIm good for something too I know that Ive
made a silly exhibition of myself here I know I didnt rise to the
occasion I know that if youd been my mother youd have been ashamed
of me I lost my presence of mind I was a contemptible coward But
_slapping himself on the chest_ Im not the man I was then This
is my day Ive seen the tenth possessor of a foolish face carried out
kicking and screaming by a woman _To Percival_ You crowed pretty
big over me You hypnotized me But when you were put through the
fire yourself you were found wanting I tell you straight I dont
give a damn for you

MRS TARLETON No thats naughty You shouldnt say that before me

GUNNER I would cut my tongue out sooner than say anything vulgar in
your presence for I regard you with respect and affection I was not
swearing I was affirming my manhood

MRS TARLETON What an idea What puts all these things into your
head

GUNNER Oh dont you think because Im a clerk that Im not one of
the intellectuals Im a reading man a thinking man I read in a
booka high class six shilling bookthis precept Affirm your
manhood It appealed to me Ive always remembered it I believe in
it I feel I must do it to recover your respect after my cowardly
behavior Therefore I affirm it in your presence I tell that man
who insulted me that I dont give a damn for him And neither I do

TARLETON I say Summerhays did you have chaps of this sort in
Jinghiskahn

LORD SUMMERHAYS Oh yes they exist everywhere they are a most
serious modern problem

GUNNER Yes Youre right _Conceitedly_ Im a problem And I
tell you that when we clerks realize that were problems well look
out thats all

LORD SUMMERHAYS _suavely to Gunner_ You read a great deal you
say

GUNNER Ive read more than any man in this room if the truth were
known I expect Thats whats going to smash up your Capitalism The
problems are beginning to read Ha Were free to do that here in
England What would you do with me in Jinghiskahn if you had me
there

LORD SUMMERHAYS Well since you ask me so directly Ill tell you
I should take advantage of the fact that you have neither sense enough
nor strength enough to know how to behave yourself in a difficulty of
any sort I should warn an intelligent and ambitious policeman that
you are a troublesome person The intelligent and ambitious policeman
would take an early opportunity of upsetting your temper by ordering
you to move on and treading on your heels until you were provoked
into obstructing an officer in the discharge of his duty Any trifle
of that sort would be sufficient to make a man like you lose your
selfpossession and put yourself in the wrong You would then be
charged and imprisoned until things quieted down

GUNNER And you call that justice

LORD SUMMERHAYS No Justice was not my business I had to govern a
province and I took the necessary steps to maintain order in it Men
are not governed by justice but by law or persuasion When they
refuse to be governed by law or persuasion they have to be governed
by force or fraud or both I used both when law and persuasion
failed me Every ruler of men since the world began has done so even
when he has hated both fraud and force as heartily as I do It is as
well that you should know this my young friend so that you may
recognize in time that anarchism is a game at which the police can
beat you What have you to say to that

GUNNER What have I to say to it Well I call it scandalous thats
what I have to say to it

LORD SUMMERHAYS Precisely thats all anybody has to say to it
except the British public which pretends not to believe it And now
let me ask you a sympathetic personal question Havnt you a headache

GUNNER Well since you ask me I have Ive overexcited myself

MRS TARLETON Poor lad No wonder after all youve gone through
You want to eat a little and to lie down You come with me I want
you to tell me about your poor dear mother and about yourself Come
along with me _She leads the way to the inner door_

GUNNER _following her obediently_ Thank you kindly madam _She
goes out Before passing out after her he partly closes the door and
stops an the landing for a moment to say_ Mind Im not knuckling
down to any man here I knuckle down to Mrs Tarleton because shes a
woman in a thousand I affirm my manhood all the same Understand
I dont give a damn for the lot of you _He hurries out rather
afraid of the consequences of this defiance which has provoked Johnny
to an impatient movement towards him_

HYPATIA Thank goodness hes gone Oh what a bore WHAT a bore
Talk talk talk

TARLETON Patsy its no good Were going to talk And were
going to talk about you

JOHNNY Its no use shirking it Pat Wed better know where we are

LORD SUMMERHAYS Come Miss Tarleton Wont you sit down Im very
tired of standing _Hypatia comes from the pavilion and takes a
chair at the worktable Lord Summerhays takes the opposite chair on
her right Percival takes the chair Johnny placed for Lina on her
arrival Tarleton sits down at the end of the writing table Johnny
remains standing Lord Summerhays continues with a sigh of relief at
being seated_ We shall now get the change of subject we are all
pining for

JOHNNY _puzzled_ Whats that

LORD SUMMERHAYS The great question The question that men and women
will spend hours over without complaining The question that occupies
all the novel readers and all the playgoers The question they never
get tired of

JOHNNY But what question

LORD SUMMERHAYS The question which particular young man some young
woman will mate with

PERCIVAL As if it mattered

HYPATIA _sharply_ Whats that you said

PERCIVAL I said As if it mattered

HYPATIA I call that ungentlemanly

PERCIVAL Do you care about that you who are so magnificently
unladylike

JOHNNY Look here Mr Percival youre not supposed to insult my
sister

HYPATIA Oh shut up Johnny I can take care of myself Dont you
interfere

JOHNNY Oh very well If you choose to give yourself away like
thatto allow a man to call you unladylike and then to be unladylike
Ive nothing more to say

HYPATIA I think Mr Percival is most ungentlemanly but I wont be
protected Ill not have my affairs interfered with by men on
pretence of protecting me Im not your baby If I interfered
between you and a woman you would soon tell me to mind my own
business

TARLETON Children dont squabble Read Dr Watts Behave
yourselves

JOHNNY Ive nothing more to say and as I dont seem to be wanted
here I shall take myself off _He goes out with affected calm
through the pavilion_

TARLETON Summerhays a family is an awful thing an impossible
thing Cat and dog Patsy Im ashamed of you

HYPATIA Ill make it up with Johnny afterwards but I really cant
have him here sticking his clumsy hoof into my affairs

LORD SUMMERHAYS The question is Mr Percival are you really a
gentleman or are you not

PERCIVAL Was Napoleon really a gentleman or was he not He made the
lady get out of the way of the porter and said Respect the burden
madam That was behaving like a very fine gentleman but he kicked
Volney for saying that what France wanted was the Bourbons back again
That was behaving rather like a navvy Now I like Napoleon am not
all one piece On occasion as you have all seen I can behave like a
gentleman On occasion I can behave with a brutal simplicity which
Miss Tarleton herself could hardly surpass

TARLETON Gentleman or no gentleman Patsy what are your
intentions

HYPATIA My intentions Surely its the gentleman who should be
asked his intentions

TARLETON Come now Patsy none of that nonsense Has Mr Percival
said anything to you that I ought to know or that Bentley ought to
know Have you said anything to Mr Percival

HYPATIA Mr Percival chased me through the heather and kissed me

LORD SUMMERHAYS As a gentleman Mr Percival what do you say to
that

PERCIVAL As a gentleman I do not kiss and tell As a mere man a
mere cad if you like I say that I did so at Miss Tarletons own
suggestion

HYPATIA Beast

PERCIVAL I dont deny that I enjoyed it But I did not initiate it
And I began by running away

TARLETON So Patsy can run faster than you can she

PERCIVAL Yes when she is in pursuit of me She runs faster and
faster I run slower and slower And these woods of yours are full
of magic There was a confounded fern owl Did you ever hear the
churr of a fern owl Did you ever hear it create a sudden silence by
ceasing Did you ever hear it call its mate by striking its wings
together twice and whistling that single note that no nightingale can
imitate That is what happened in the woods when I was running away
So I turned and the pursuer became the pursued

HYPATIA I had to fight like a wild cat

LORD SUMMERHAYS Please dont tell us this Its not fit for old
people to hear

TARLETON Come how did it end

HYPATIA Its not ended yet

TARLETON How is it going to end

HYPATIA Ask him

TARLETON How is it going to end Mr Percival

PERCIVAL I cant afford to marry Mr Tarleton Ive only a thousand a
year until my father dies Two people cant possibly live on that

TARLETON Oh cant they When _I_ married I should have been jolly
glad to have felt sure of the quarter of it

PERCIVAL No doubt but I am not a cheap person Mr Tarleton I was
brought up in a household which cost at least seven or eight times
that and I am in constant money difficulties because I simply dont
know how to live on the thousand a year scale As to ask a woman to
share my degrading poverty its out of the question Besides Im
rather young to marry Im only 28

HYPATIA Papa buy the brute for me

LORD SUMMERHAYS _shrinking_ My dear Miss Tarleton dont be so
naughty I know how delightful it is to shock an old man but there
is a point at which it becomes barbarous Dont Please dont

HYPATIA Shall I tell Papa about you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Tarleton I had better tell you that I once asked
your daughter to become my widow

TARLETON _to Hypatia_ Why didnt you accept him you young idiot

LORD SUMMERHAYS I was too old

TARLETON All this has been going on under my nose I suppose You
run after young men and old men run after you And Im the last
person in the world to hear of it

HYPATIA How could I tell you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Parents and children Tarleton

TARLETON Oh the gulf that lies between them the impassable
eternal gulf And so Im to buy the brute for you eh

HYPATIA If you please papa

TARLETON Whats the price Mr Percival

PERCIVAL We might do with another fifteen hundred if my father would
contribute But I should like more

TARLETON Its purely a question of money with you is it

PERCIVAL _after a moments consideration_ Practically yes it
turns on that

TARLETON I thought you might have some sort of preference for Patsy
you know

PERCIVAL Well but does that matter do you think Patsy fascinates
me no doubt I apparently fascinate Patsy But believe me all
that is not worth considering One of my three fathers the priest
has married hundreds of couples couples selected by one another
couples selected by the parents couples forced to marry one another
by circumstances of one kind or another and he assures me that if
marriages were made by putting all the mens names into one sack and
the womens names into another and having them taken out by a
blindfolded child like lottery numbers there would be just as high a
percentage of happy marriages as we have here in England He said
Cupid was nothing but the blindfolded child pretty idea that I
think I shall have as good a chance with Patsy as with anyone else
Mind Im not bigoted about it Im not a doctrinaire not the
slave of a theory You and Lord Summerhays are experienced married
men If you can tell me of any trustworthy method of selecting a
wife I shall be happy to make use of it I await your suggestions
_He looks with polite attention to Lord Summerhays who having
nothing to say avoids his eye He looks to Tarleton who purses his
lips glumly and rattles his money in his pockets without a word_
Apparently neither of you has anything to suggest Then Patsy will do
as well as another provided the money is forthcoming

HYPATIA Oh you beauty you beauty

TARLETON When I married Patsys mother I was in love with her

PERCIVAL For the first time

TARLETON Yes for the first time

PERCIVAL For the last time

LORD SUMMERHAYS _revolted_ Sir you are in the presence of his
daughter

HYPATIA Oh dont mind me I dont care Im accustomed to Papas
adventures

TARLETON _blushing painfully_ Patsy my child that was notnot
delicate

HYPATIA Well papa youve never shewn any delicacy in talking to me
about my conduct and I really dont see why I shouldnt talk to you
about yours Its such nonsense Do you think young people dont
know

LORD SUMMERHAYS Im sure they dont feel Tarleton this is too
horrible too brutal If neither of these young people have
anyanyany

PERCIVAL Shall we say paternal sentimentality Im extremely sorry
to shock you but you must remember that Ive been educated to discuss
human affairs with three fathers simultaneously Im an adult person
Patsy is an adult person You do not inspire me with veneration
Apparently you do not inspire Patsy with veneration That may
surprise you It may pain you Im sorry It cant be helped What
about the money

TARLETON You dont inspire me with generosity young man

HYPATIA _laughing with genuine amusement_ He had you there Joey

TARLETON I havnt been a bad father to you Patsy

HYPATIA I dont say you have dear If only I could persuade you Ive
grown up we should get along perfectly

TARLETON Do you remember Bill Burt

HYPATIA Why

TARLETON _to the others_ Bill Burt was a laborer here I was
going to sack him for kicking his father He said his father had
kicked him until he was big enough to kick back Patsy begged him
off I asked that man what it felt like the first time he kicked his
father and found that it was just like kicking any other man He
laughed and said that it was the old man that knew what it felt like
Think of that Summerhays think of that

HYPATIA I havnt kicked you papa

TARLETON Youve kicked me harder than Bill Burt ever kicked

LORD SUMMERHAYS Its no use Tarleton Spare yourself Do you
seriously expect these young people at their age to sympathize with
what this gentleman calls your paternal sentimentality

TARLETON _wistfully_ Is it nothing to you but paternal
sentimentality Patsy

HYPATIA Well I greatly prefer your superabundant vitality papa

TARLETON _violently_ Hold your tongue you young devil The
young are all alike hard coarse shallow cruel selfish
dirtyminded You can clear out of my house as soon as you can coax
him to take you and the sooner the better _To Percival_ I think
you said your price was fifteen hundred a year Take it And I wish
you joy of your bargain

PERCIVAL If you wish to know who I am

TARLETON I dont care a tinkers curse who you are or what you are
Youre willing to take that girl off my hands for fifteen hundred a
year thats all that concerns me Tell her who you are if you like
its her affair not mine

HYPATIA Dont answer him Joey it wont last Lord Summerhays Im
sorry about Bentley but Joeys the only man for me

LORD SUMMERHAYS It may

HYPATIA Please dont say it may break your poor boys heart Its
much more likely to break yours

LORD SUMMERHAYS Oh

TARLETON _springing to his feet_ Leave the room Do you hear
leave the room

PERCIVAL Arnt we getting a little cross Dont be angry Mr
Tarleton Read Marcus Aurelius

TARLETON Dont you dare make fun of me Take your aeroplane out of
my vinery and yourself out of my house

PERCIVAL _rising to Hypatia_ Im afraid I shall have to dine at
the Beacon Patsy

HYPATIA _rising_ Do I dine with you

TARLETON Did you hear me tell you to leave the room

HYPATIA I did _To Percival_ You see what living with ones
parents means Joey It means living in a house where you can be
ordered to leave the room Ive got to obey its his house not
mine

TARLETON Who pays for it Go and support yourself as I did if you
want to be independent

HYPATIA I wanted to and you wouldnt let me How can I support
myself when Im a prisoner

TARLETON Hold your tongue

HYPATIA Keep your temper

PERCIVAL _coming between them_ Lord Summerhays youll join me
Im sure in pointing out to both father and daughter that they have
now reached that very common stage in family life at which anything
but a blow would be an anticlimax Do you seriously want to beat
Patsy Mr Tarleton

TARLETON Yes I want to thrash the life out of her If she doesnt
get out of my reach Ill do it _He sits down and grasps the
writing table to restrain himself_

HYPATIA _coolly going to him and leaning with her breast on his
writhing shoulders_ Oh if you want to beat me just to relieve your
feelingsjust really and truly for the fun of it and the satisfaction
of it beat away I dont grudge you that

TARLETON _almost in hysterics_ I used to think that this sort of
thing went on in other families but that it never could happen in
ours And now _He is broken with emotion and continues
lamentably_ I cant say the right thing I cant do the right thing
I dont know what is the right thing Im beaten and she knows it
Summerhays tell me what to do

LORD SUMMERHAYS When my council in Jinghiskahn reached the point of
coming to blows I used to adjourn the sitting Let us postpone the
discussion Wait until Monday we shall have Sunday to quiet down
in Believe me Im not making fun of you but I think theres
something in this young gentlemans advice Read something

TARLETON Ill read King Lear

HYPATIA Dont Im very sorry dear

TARLETON Youre not Youre laughing at me Serve me right Parents
and children No man should know his own child No child should know
its own father Let the family be rooted out of civilization Let
the human race be brought up in institutions

HYPATIA Oh yes How jolly You and I might be friends then and
Joey could stay to dinner

TARLETON Let him stay to dinner Let him stay to breakfast Let
him spend his life here Dont you say I drove him out Dont you say
I drove you out

PERCIVAL I really have no right to inflict myself on you Dropping
in as I did

TARLETON Out of the sky Ha Dropping in The new sport of
aviation You just see a nice house drop in scoop up the mans
daughter and off with you again

_Bentley comes back with his shoulders hanging as if he too had been
exercised to the last pitch of fatigue He is very sad They stare
at him as he gropes to Percivals chair_

BENTLEY Im sorry for making a fool of myself I beg your pardon
Hypatia Im awfully sorry but Ive made up my mind that Ill never
marry _He sits down in deep depression_

HYPATIA _running to him_ How nice of you Bentley Of course you
guessed I wanted to marry Joey What did the Polish lady do to you

BENTLEY _turning his head away_ Id rather not speak of her if
you dont mind

HYPATIA Youve fallen in love with her _She laughs_

BENTLEY Its beastly of you to laugh

LORD SUMMERHAYS Youre not the first to fall today under the lash of
that young ladys terrible derision Bentley

_Lina her cap on and her goggles in her hand comes impetuously
through the inner door_

LINA _on the steps_ Mr Percival can we get that aeroplane
started again _She comes down and runs to the pavilion door_ I
must get out of this into the air right up into the blue

PERCIVAL Impossible The frames twisted The petrol has given
out thats what brought us down And how can we get a clear run to
start with among these woods

LINA _swooping back through the middle of the pavilion_ We can
straighten the frame We can buy petrol at the Beacon With a few
laborers we can get her out on to the Portsmouth Road and start her
along that

TARLETON _rising_ But why do you want to leave us Miss Szcz

LINA Old pal this is a stuffy house You seem to think of nothing
but making love All the conversation here is about lovemaking All
the pictures are about lovemaking The eyes of all of you are
sheeps eyes You are steeped in it soaked in it the very texts on
the walls of your bedrooms are the ones about love It is disgusting
It is not healthy Your women are kept idle and dressed up for no
other purpose than to be made love to I have not been here an hour
and already everybody makes love to me as if because I am a woman it
were my profession to be made love to First you old pal I forgave
you because you were nice about your wife

HYPATIA Oh oh oh Oh papa

LINA Then you Lord Summerhays come to me and all you have to say
is to ask me not to mention that you made love to me in Vienna two
years ago I forgave you because I thought you were an ambassador
and all ambassadors make love and are very nice and useful to people
who travel Then this young gentleman He is engaged to this young
lady but no matter for that he makes love to me because I carry him
off in my arms when he cries All these I bore in silence But now
comes your Johnny and tells me Im a ripping fine woman and asks me
to marry him I Lina Szczepanowska MARRY him I do not mind
this boy he is a child he loves me I should have to give him
money and take care of him that would be foolish but honorable I
do not mind you old pal you are what you call an oldouf but you
do not offer to buy me you say until we are tireduntil you are so
happy that you dare not ask for more That is foolish too at your
age but it is an adventure it is not dishonorable I do not mind
Lord Summerhays it was in Vienna they had been toasting him at a
great banquet he was not sober That is bad for the health but it
is not dishonorable But your Johnny Oh your Johnny with his
marriage He will do the straight thing by me He will give me a
home a position He tells me I must know that my present position is
not one for a nice woman This to me Lina Szczepanowska I am an
honest woman I earn my living I am a free woman I live in my own
house I am a woman of the world I have thousands of friends
every night crowds of people applaud me delight in me buy my
picture pay hardearned money to see me I am strong I am skilful
I am brave I am independent I am unbought I am all that a woman
ought to be and in my family there has not been a single drunkard for
four generations And this Englishman this linendraper he dares to
ask me to come and live with him in this rrrrrrrabbit hutch and take
my bread from his hand and ask him for pocket money and wear soft
clothes and be his woman his wife Sooner than that I would stoop
to the lowest depths of my profession I would stuff lions with food
and pretend to tame them I would deceive honest peoples eyes with
conjuring tricks instead of real feats of strength and skill I would
be a clown and set bad examples of conduct to little children I
would sink yet lower and be an actress or an opera singer imperilling
my soul by the wicked lie of pretending to be somebody else All this
I would do sooner than take my bread from the hand of a man and make
him the master of my body and soul And so you may tell your Johnny
to buy an Englishwoman he shall not buy Lina Szczepanowska and I
will not stay in the house where such dishonor is offered me Adieu
_She turns precipitately to go but is faced in the pavilion doorway
by Johnny who comes in slowly his hands in his pockets meditating
deeply_

JOHNNY _confidentially to Lina_ You wont mention our little
conversation Miss Shepanoska Itll do no good and Id rather you
didnt

TARLETON Weve just heard about it Johnny

JOHNNY _shortly but without illtemper_ Oh is that so

HYPATIA The cats out of the bag Johnny about everybody They
were all beforehand with you papa Lord Summerhays Bentley and all
Dont you let them laugh at you

JOHNNY _a grin slowly overspreading his countenance_ Well theres
no use my pretending to be surprised at you Governor is there I
hope you got it as hot as I did Mind Miss Shepanoska it wasnt
lost on me Im a thinking man I kept my temper Youll admit that

LINA _frankly_ Oh yes I do not quarrel You are what is called
a chump but you are not a bad sort of chump

JOHNNY Thank you Well if a chump may have an opinion I should
put it at this You make I suppose ten pounds a night off your own
bat Miss Lina

LINA _scornfully_ Ten pounds a night I have made ten pounds a
minute

JOHNNY _with increased respect_ Have you indeed I didnt know
youll excuse my mistake I hope But the principle is the same Now
I trust you wont be offended at what Im going to say but Ive thought
about this and watched it in daily experience and you may take it
from me that the moment a woman becomes pecuniarily independent she
gets hold of the wrong end of the stick in moral questions

LINA Indeed And what do you conclude from that Mister Johnny

JOHNNY Well obviously that independence for women is wrong and
shouldnt be allowed For their own good you know And for the good
of morality in general You agree with me Lord Summerhays dont you

LORD SUMMERHAYS Its a very moral moral if I may so express myself

_Mrs Tarleton comes in softly through the inner door_

MRS TARLETON Dont make too much noise The lads asleep

TARLETON Chickabiddy we have some news for you

JOHNNY _apprehensively_ Now theres no need you know Governor
to worry mother with everything that passes

MRS TARLETON _coming to Tarleton_ Whats been going on Dont you
hold anything back from me John What have you been doing

TARLETON Bentley isnt going to marry Patsy

MRS TARLETON Of course not Is that your great news I never
believed shed marry him

TARLETON Theres something else Mr Percival here

MRS TARLETON _to Percival_ Are you going to marry Patsy

PERCIVAL _diplomatically_ Patsy is going to marry me with your
permission

MRS TARLETON Oh she has my permission she ought to have been
married long ago

HYPATIA Mother

TARLETON Miss Lina here though she has been so short a time with
us has inspired a good deal of attachment inI may say in almost all
of us Therefore I hope shell stay to dinner and not insist on
flying away in that aeroplane

PERCIVAL You must stay Miss Szczepanowska I cant go up again this
evening

LINA Ive seen you work it Do you think I require any help And
Bentley shall come with me as a passenger

BENTLEY _terrified_ Go up in an aeroplane I darent

LINA You must learn to dare

BENTLEY _pale but heroic_ All right Ill come

LORD SUMMERHAYS No no Bentley impossible I
  shall not allow it
 
MRS TARLETON  Do you want to kill the child He shant go

BENTLEY I will Ill lie down and yell until you let me go Im
not a coward I wont be a coward

LORD SUMMERHAYS Miss Szczepanowska my son is very dear to me I
implore you to wait until tomorrow morning

LINA There may be a storm tomorrow And Ill go storm or no
storm I must risk my life tomorrow

BENTLEY I hope there will be a storm

LINA _grasping his arm_ You are trembling

BENTLEY Yes its terror sheer terror I can hardly see I can
hardly stand But Ill go with you

LINA _slapping him on the back and knocking a ghastly white smile
into his face_ You shall I like you my boy We go tomorrow
together

BENTLEY Yes together tomorrow

TARLETON Well sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof Read
the old book

MRS TARLETON Is there anything else

TARLETON Well Ier _he addresses Lina and stops_ Ier _he
addresses Lord Summerhays and stops_ Ier _he gives it up_
Well I supposeerI suppose theres nothing more to be said

HYPATIA _fervently_ Thank goodness
