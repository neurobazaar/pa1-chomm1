ACT I

 HILLCRISTS study A pleasant room with books in calf
 bindings and signs that the HILLCRISTS have travelled such
 as a large photograph of the Taj Mahal of Table Mountain and
 the Pyramids of Egypt A large bureau stage Right devoted
 to the business of a country estate Two foxes masks
 Flowers in bowls Deep armchairs A large French window open
 at Back with a lovely view of a slight rise of fields and
 trees in August sunlight A fine stone fireplace stage Left
 A door Left A door opposite Right General colour
 effectstone and cigarleaf brown with spots of bright
 colour

 HILLCRIST sits in a swivel chair at the bureau busy with
 papers He has gout and his left foot is encased accord He
 is a thin driedup man of about fiftyfive with a rather
 refined rather kindly and rather cranky countenance Close
 to him stands his very upstanding nineteenyearold daughter
 JILL with clubbed hair round a pretty manly face

JILL You know Dodo its all pretty good rot in these days

HILLCRIST Cads are cads Jill even in these days

JILL What is a cad

HILLCRIST A selfassertive fellow without a sense of other
people

JILL Well Old Hornblower Ill give you

HILLCRIST I wouldnt take him

JILL Well youve got him Now CharlieChearlieI saythe
importance of not being Charlie

HILLCRIST Good heavens do you know their Christian names

JILL My dear father theyve been here seven years

HILLCRIST In old days we only knew their Christian names from
their tombstones

JILL Charlie Hornblower isnt really half a bad sport

HILLCRIST About a quarter of a bad sport Ive always thought out
hunting

JILL Pulling his hair Now his wifeChloe

HILLCRIST Whimsical Gad your motherd have a fit if she knew
you called her Chloe

JILL Its a ripping name

HILLCRIST Chloe Hm I had a spaniel once

JILL Dodo youre narrow Buck up old darling it wont do
Chloe has seen life Im pretty sure THATS attractive anyway
No mothers not in the room dont turn your uneasy eyes

HILLCRIST Really my dear you are getting

JILL The limit Now Rolf

HILLCRIST Whats Rolf Another dog

JILL Rolf Hornblowers a topper he really is a nice boy

HILLCRIST With a sharp look Oh Hes a nice boy

JILL Yes darling You know what a nice boy is dont you

HILLCRIST Not in these days

JILL Well Ill tell you In the first place hes not amorous

HILLCRIST What Well thats some comfort

JILL Just a jolly good companion

HILLCRIST To whom

JILL Well to anyoneme

HILLCRIST Where

JILL Anywhere You dont suppose I confine myself to the home
paddocks do you Im naturally rangey Father

HILLCRIST Ironically You dont say so

JILL In the second place he doesnt like discipline

HILLCRIST Jupiter He does seem attractive

JILL In the third place he bars his father

HILLCRIST Is that essential to nice girls too

JILL With a twirl of his hair Fish not Fourthly hes got
ideas

HILLCRIST I knew it

JILL For instance he thinksas I do

HILLCRIST Ah Good ideas

JILL Pulling gently Careful He thinks old people run the show
too much He says they oughtnt to because theyre so damtouchy
Are you damtouchy darling

HILLCRIST Well Im I dont know about touchy

JILL He says therell be no world fit to live in till we get rid
of the old We must make them climb a tall tree and shake them off
it

HILLCRIST Drily Oh he says that

JILL Otherwise with the way they stand on each others rights
theyll spoil the garden for the young

HILLCRIST Does his father agree

JILL Oh Rolf doesnt talk to him his mouths too large Have
you ever seen it Dodo

HILLCRIST Of course

JILL Its considerable isnt it Now yours isreticent
darling Rumpling his hair

HILLCRIST It wont be in a minute Do you realise that Ive got
gout

JILL Poor ducky How long have we been here Dodo

HILLCRIST Since Elizabeth anyway

JILL Looking at his foot It has its drawbacks Dyou think
Hornblower had a father I believe he was spontaneous But Dodo
why all thisthis attitude to the Hornblowers

 She purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons
 away

HILLCRIST Because theyre pushing

JILL Thats only because we are as mother would say and theyre
notyet But why not let them be

HILLCRIST You cant

JILL Why

HILLCRIST It takes generations to learn to live and let live
Jill People like that take an ell when you give them an inch

JILL But if you gave them the ell they wouldnt want the inch
Why should it all be such a skin game

HILLCRIST Skin game Where do you get your lingo

JILL Keep to the point Dodo

HILLCRIST Well Jill all lifes a struggle between people at
different stages of development in different positions with
different amounts of social influence and property And the only
thing is to have rules of the game and keep them New people like
the Hornblowers havent learnt those rules their only rule is to
get all they can

JILL Darling dont prose Theyre not half as bad as you think

HILLCRIST Well when I sold Hornblower Longmeadow and the
cottages I certainly found him all right All the same hes got
the cloven hoof Warming up His influence in Deepwater is
thoroughly bad those potteries of his are demoralisingthe whole
atmosphere of the place is changing It was a thousand pities he
ever came here and discovered that clay Hes brought in the modern
cutthroat spirit

JILL Cut our throat spirit you mean Whats your definition of a
gentleman Dodo

HILLCRIST Uneasily Cant describeonly feel it

JILL Oh Try

HILLCRIST WellerI suppose you might saya man who keeps his
form and doesnt let life scupper him out of his standards

JILL But suppose his standards are low

HILLCRIST With some earnestness I assume of course that hes
honest and tolerant gentle to the weak and not selfseeking

JILL Ah selfseeking But arent we all Dodo I am

HILLCRIST With a smile You

JILL Scornfully Oh yestoo young to know

HILLCRIST Nobody knows till theyre under pretty heavy fire Jill

JILL Except of course mother

HILLCRIST How do you meanmother

JILL Mother reminds me of England according to herselfalways
right whatever she does

HILLCRIST Yees Your mother it perhapsthe perfect woman

JILL Thats what I was saying Now no one could call you
perfect Dodo Besides youve got gout

HILLCRIST Yes and I want Fellows Ring that bell

JILL Crossing to the bell Shall I tell you my definition of a
gentleman A man who gives the Hornblower his due She rings the
bell And I think mother ought to call on them Rolf says old
Hornblower resents it fearfully that shes never made a sign to
Chloe the three years shes been here

HILLCRIST I dont interfere with your mother in such matters She
may go and call on the devil himself if she likes

JILL I know youre ever so much better than she is

HILLCRIST Thats respectful

JILL You do keep your prejudices out of your phiz But mother
literally looks down her nose And she never forgives an h
Theyd get the hell from her if they took the hinch

HILLCRIST Jillyour language

JILL Dont slime out of it Dodo I say mother ought to call on
the Hornblowers No answer Well

HILLCRIST My dear I always let people have the last word It
makes themfeel funny Ugh My footEnter FELLOWS Left
Fellows send into the village and get another bottle of this stuff

HILLCRIST Your what

FELLOWS The wrist I draw corks with

HILLCRIST With a cackle Youd have had more than a twinge if

FELLOWS Excuse me sirVichy water corks in my experience are
worse than any wine

HILLCRIST Ironically Ah The countrys not what it was is it
Fellows

FELLOWS Getting very new sir

HILLCRIST Feelingly Youre right Has Dawker come

FELLOWS Not yet sir The Jackmans would like to see you sir

HILLCRIST What about

FELLOWS I dont know sir

HILLCRIST Well show them in

FELLOWS Going Yes sir

 HILLCRIST turns his swivel chair round The JACKMANS come in
 He a big fellow about fifty in a labourers dress with eyes
 which have more in then than his tongue can express she a
 little woman with a worn face a bright quick glance and a
 tongue to match

HILLCRIST Good morning Mrs Jackman Morning Jackman Havent
seen you for a long time What can I do

 He draws in foot and breath with a sharp hiss

HILLCRIST In a downhearted voice Weve had notice to quit
sir

HILLCRIST With emphasis What

JACKMAN Got to be out this week

MRS J Yes sir indeed

HILLCRIST Well but when I sold Longmeadow and the cottages it
was on the express understanding that there was to be no disturbance
of tenancies

MRS J Yes sir but weve all got to go Mrs Arvey and the
Drews an us and there isnt another cottage to be had anywhere in
Deepwater

HILLCRIST I know I want one for my cowman This wont do at all
Where do you get it from

JACKMAN Mr Ornblower imself air Just an hour ago He come
round and said Im sorry I want the cottages and youve got to
clear

MRS J Bitterly Hes no gentleman sir he put it so brisk We
been there thirty years and now we dont know what to do So I
hope youll excuse us coming round sir

HILLCRIST I should think so indeed Hm He rises and limps
across to the fireplace on his stick To himself The cloven hoof
By George this is a breach of faith Ill write to him Jackman
Confound it Id certainly never have sold if Id known he was
going to do this

MRS J No sir Im sure sir They do say its to do with the
potteries He wants the cottages for his workmen

HILLCRIST Sharply Thats all very well but he shouldnt have
led me to suppose that he would make no change

JACKMAN Heavily They talk about his havin bought the Centry to
gut up more chimneys there and thats why he wants the cottages

HINT The Centry Impossible

 Mrs J Yes air its such a pretty spotlooks beautiful
 from here She looks out through the window Loveliest spot
 in all Deepwater I always say And your father owned it and
 his father before im Its a pity they ever sold it sir
 beggin your pardon

HILLCRIST The Centry He rings the bell

Mrs J Who has brightened up Im glad youre goin to stop it
sir It does put us about We dont know where to go I said to
Mr Hornblower I said Im sure Mr Hillcrist would never eve
turned us out An e said Mr Hillcrist be beggin your
pardon sir Make no mistake e said you must go missis He
dont even know our name an to come it like this over us Hes a
dreadful new man I think with his overridin notions And sich a
heavyfooted man to look at With a sort of indulgent contempt
But hes from the North they say

 FELLOWS has entered Left

HILLCRIST Ask Mrs Hillcrist if shell come

FELLOWS Very good sir

HILLCRIST Is Dawker here

FELLOWS Not yet sir

HILLCRIST I want to see him at once

 FELLOWS retires

JACKMAN Mr Hornblower said he was comin on to see you sir So
we thought wed step along first

HILLCRIST Quite right Jackman

MRS J I said to Jackman Mr Hillcristll stand up for us I
know Hes a gentleman I said This man I said dont care
for the neighbourhood or the people he dont care for anything so
long as he makes his money and has his importance You cant
expect it I suppose I said Bitterly havin got rich so
sudden The gentry dont do things like that

HILLCRIST Abstracted Quite Mrs Jackman quite
To himself The Centry No

 MRS HILLCRIST enters A welldressed woman with a firm
 clearcut face

Oh Amy Mr and Mrs Jackman turned out of their cottage and
Mrs Harvey and the Drews When I sold to Hornblower I stipulated
that they shouldnt be

MRS J Our weeks up on Saturday maam and Im sure I dont know
where we shall turn because of course Jackman must be near his
work and I shall lose me washin if we have to go far

HILLCRIST With decision You leave it to me Mrs Jackman Good
morning Morning Jackman Sorry I cant move with this gout

MRS J For them both Im sure were very sorry sir Good
morning sir Good morning maam and thank you kindly They go
out

HILLCRIST Turning people out that have been there thirty years I
wont have it Its a breach of faith

MRS H Do you suppose this Hornblower will care two straws about
that Jack

HILLCRIST He must when its put to him if hes got any decent
feeling

MRS H He hasnt

HILLCRIST Suddenly The Jackmans talk of his having bought the
Centry to put up more chimneys

MRS H Never At the window looking out Impossible It would
ruin the place utterly besides cutting us off from the Dukes Oh
no Miss Mullins would never sell behind our backs

HILLCRIST Anyway I must stop his turning these people out

Mrs H With a little smile almost contemptuous You might have
known hed do something of the sort You will imagine people are
like yourself Jack You always ought to make Dawker have things in
black and white

HILLCRIST I said quite distinctly Of course you wont want to
disturb the tenancies theres a great shortage of cottages
Hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldnt What more do you
want

Mrs H A man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his
own way Looking out of the window towards the rise If he buys
the Centry and puts up chimneys we simply couldnt stop here

HILLCRIST My father would turn in his grave

MRS H It would have been more useful if hed not dipped the
estate and sold the Centry This Hornblower hates us he thinks we
turn up our noses at him

HILLCRIST As we do Amy

MRS H Who wouldnt A man without traditions who believes in
nothing but money and push

HILLCRIST Suppose he wont budge can we do anything for the
Jackmans

MRS H There are the two rooms Beaver used to have over the
stables

FELLOWS Mr Dawker sir

 DAWKERS is a short square rather redfaced terrier of a man
 in riding clothes and gaiters

HILLCRIST Ah Dawker Ive got gout again

DAWKER Very sorry sir How de do maam

HILLCRIST Did you meet the Jackmans

DAWKERS Yeh

 He hardly ever quite finishes a word seeming to snap of their
 tails

HILLCRIST Then you heard

DAWKER Nodding Smart man Hornblower never lets grass grow

HILLCRIST Smart

DAWKER Grinning Dont do to underrate your neighbours

MRS H A cadI call him

DAWKER Thats it maamgot all the advantage

HILLCRIST Heard anything about the Centry Dawker

DAWKER Hornblower wants to buy

HILLCRIST Miss Mullins would never sell would she

DAWKER She wants to

HILLCRIST The deuce she does

DAWKER He wont stick at the price either

MRS H Whats it worth Dawker

DAWKER Depends on what you want it for

MRS H He wants it for spite we want it for sentiment

DAWKER Grinning Worth what you like to give then but hes a
rich man

MRS H Intolerable

DAWKER To HILLCRIST Give me your figure sir Ill try the old
lady before he gets at her

HILLCRIST Pondering I dont want to buy unless theres nothing
else for it I should have to raise the money on the estate it
wont stand much more I cant believe the fellow would be such a
barbarian Chimneys within three hundred yards right in front of
this house Its a nightmare

MRS H Youd much better let Dawker make sure Jack

HILLCRIST Uncomfortable Jackman says Hornblowers coming round
to see me I shall put it to him

DAWKER Make him keener than ever Better get in first

HILLCRIST Ape his methodsUgh Confound this gout He gets
back to his chair with difficulty Look here Dawker I wanted to
see you about gates

FELLOWS Entering Mr Hornblower

 HORNBLOWER entersa man of medium height thoroughly
 broadened blown out as it were by success He has thick
 coarse dark hair just grizzled wry bushy eyebrow a wide
 mouth He wears quite ordinary clothes as if that department
 were in charge of someone who knew about such things He has
 a small rose in his buttonhole and carries a Homburg hat
 which one suspects will look too small on his head

HORNBLOWER Good morning good morning How are ye Dawker Fine
morning Lovely weather

 His voice has a curious blend in its tone of brass and oil
 and an accent not quite Scotch nor quite North country

Havent seen ye for a long time Hillcrist

HILLCRIST Who has risen Not since I sold you Longmeadow and
those cottages I believe

HORNBLOWER Dear me now thats what I came about

HILLCRIST Subsiding again into his chair Forgive me Wont you
sit down

HORNBLOWER Not sitting Have ye got gout Thats unfortunate
I never get it Ive no disposition that way Had no ancestors
you see Just me own drinkin to answer for

HILLCRIST Youre lucky

HORNBLOWER I wonder if Mrs Hillcrist thinks that Am I lucky to
have no past maam Just the future

MRS H Youre sure you have the future Mr Hornblower

HORNBLOWER With a laugh Thats your aristocratic rapier thrust
You aristocrats are very hard people underneath your manners Ye
love to lay a body out But Ive got the future all right

HILLCRIST Meaningly Ive had the Dackmans here Mr Hornblower

HORNBLOWER Who are theyman with the little spitfire wife

HILLCRIST Theyre very excellent good people and theyve been in
that cottage quietly thirty years

HORNBLOWER Throwing out his forefingera favourite gesture Ah
yeve wanted me to stir ye up a bit Deepwater needs a bit o go
put into it Theres generally some go where I am I daresay you
wish thered been no come He laughs

MRS H We certainly like people to keep their word Mr
Hornblower

HILLCRIST Amy

HORNBLOWER Never mind Hillcrist takes more than that to upset
me

 MRS HILLCRIST exchanges a look with DAWKER who slips out
 unobserved

HILLCRIST You promised me you know not to change the tenancies

HORNBLOWER Well Ive come to tell ye that I have I wasnt
expecting to have the need when I bought Thought the Duke would
sell me a bit down there but devil a bit he will and now I must
have those cottages for my workmen Ive got important works ye
know

HILLCRIST Getting heated The Jackmans have their importance
too sir Their hearts in that cottage

HORNBLOWER Have a sense of proportion man My works supply
thousands of people and my hearts in them Whats more they
make my fortune Ive got ambitionsIm a serious man Suppose I
were to consider this and that and every little potty objection
where should I get tonowhere

HILLCRIST All the same this sort of thing isnt done you know

HORNBLOWER Not by you because yeve got no need to do it Here ye
are quite content on what your fathers made for ye Yeve no
ambitions and ye want other people to have none How dye think
your fathers got your land

HILLCRIST Who has risen Not by breaking their word

HORNBLOWER Throwing out his finger Dont ye believe it They
got it by breaking their word and turnin out Jackmans if thats
their name all over the place

MRS H Thats an insult Mr Hornblower

HORNBLOWER No its a repartee If ye think so much of these
Jackmans build them a cottage yourselves yeve got the space

HILLCRIST Thats beside the point You promised me and I sold on
that understanding

HORNBLOWER And I bought on the understandin that Id get some
more land from the Duke

HILLCRIST Thats nothing to do with me

HORNBLOWER Yell find it has because Im going to have those
cottages

HILLCRIST Well I call it simply

 He checks himself

HORNBLOWER Look here Hillcrist yeve not had occasion to
understand men like me Ive got the guts and Ive got the money
and I dont sit still on it Im going ahead because I believe in
meself Ive no use for sentiment and that sort of thing Forty of
your Jackmans arent worth me little finger

HILLCRIST Angry Of all the blatant things I ever heard said

HORNBLOWER Well as were speaking plainly Ive been thinkin
Ye want the village run your oldfashioned way and I want it run
mine I fancy theres not room for the two of us here

MRS H When are you going

HORNBLOWER Never fear Im not going

HILLCRIST Look here Mr Hornblowerthis infernal gout makes me
irritableputs me at a disadvantage But I should be glad if youd
kindly explain yourself

HORNBLOWER With a great smile Ca canny Im fra the North

HILLCRIST Im told you wish to buy the Centry and put more of your
chimneys up there regardless of the fact He Points through the
window that it would utterly ruin the house weve had for
generations and all our pleasure here

HORNBLOWER How the man talks Why Yed think he owned the sky
because his fathers built him a house with a pretty view where hes
nothing to do but live Its sheer want of something to do that
gives ye your fine sentiments Hillcrist


HILLCRIST Have the goodness not to charge me with idleness
Dawkerwhere is heHe shows the bureau When you do the
drudgery of your works as thoroughly as I do that of my estate
Is it true about the Centry

HORNBLOWER Gospel true If ye want to know my son Chearlie is
buyin it this very minute

MRS H Turning with a start What do you say

HORNBLOWER Ay hes with the old lady she wants to sell an
shell get her price whatever it is

HILLCRIST With deep anger If that isnt a skin game Mr
Hornblower I dont know what is

HORNBLOWER Ah Yeve got a very nice expression there Skin
game Well bad words break no bones an theyre wonderful for
hardenin the heart If it wasnt for a ladys presence I could
give ye a specimen or two

MRS H Oh Mr Hornblower that need not stop you Im sure

HORNBLOWER Well and I dont know that it need Yere an
obstructionthe like of youyere in my path And anyone in my
path doesnt stay there long or if he does he stays there on my
terms And my terms are chimneys in the Centry where I need em
Itll do ye a power of good too to know that yere not almighty

HILLCRIST And thats being neighbourly

HORNBLOWER And how have ye tried bein neighbourly to me If I
havent a wife Ive got a daughterinlaw Have Ye celled on her
maam Im new and yere an old family Ye dont like me ye
think Im a pushin man I go to chapel an ye dont like that
I make things and I sell them and ye dont like that I buy land
and ye dont like that It threatens the view from your windies
Well I dont lie you and Im not goin to put up with your
attitude Yeve had things your own way too long and now yere not
going to have them any longer

HILLCRIST Will you hold to your word over those cottages

HORNBLOWER Im goin to have the cottages I need them and more
besides now Im to put up me new works

HILLCRIST Thats a declaration of war

HORNBLOWER Ye never said a truer word Its one or the other of
us and I rather think its goin to be me Im the risin and
youre the settin sun as the poet says

HILLCRIST Touching the bell We shall see if you can ride
roughshod like this We used to have decent ways of going about
things here You want to change all that Well we shall do our
damnedest to stop you To FELLOWS at the door Are the Jackmans
still in the house Ask them to be good enough to come in

HORNBLOWER With the first sign of uneasiness Ive seen these
people Ive nothing more to say to them I told em Id give em
five pounds to cover their moving

HILLCRIST It doesnt occur to you that people however humble
like to have some say in their own fate

HORNBLOWER I never had any say in mine till I had the brass and
nobody ever will Its all hypocrisy You county folk are fair
awful hypocrites Ye talk about good form and all that sort o
thing Its just the comfortable doctrine of the man in the saddle
sentimental varnish Yere every bit as hard as I am underneath

MRS H Who had been standing very still all this time You
flatter us

HORNBLOWER Not at all God helps those who elp themselves
thats at the bottom of all religion Im goin to help meself and
Gods going to help me

MRS H I admire your knowledge

HILLCRIST We are in the right and God helps

HORNBLOWER Dont ye believe it ye avent got the energy

MRS H Nor perhaps the conceit

HORNBLOWER Throwing out his forefinger No no tisnt conceit
to believe in yourself when yeve got reason to The JACKMANS
have entered

HILLCRIST Im very sorry Mrs Jackman but I just wanted you to
realise that Ive done my best with this gentleman

MRS J Doubtfully Yes sir I thought if you spoke for us
hed feel differentlike

HORNBLOWER One cottage is the same as another missis I made ye
a fair offer of five pounds for the moving

JACKMAN Slowly We wouldnt take fifty to go out of that ouse
We brought up three children there an buried two from it

MRS J To MRS HILLCRIST Were attached to it like maam

HILLCRIST To HORNBLOWER How would you like being turned out of
a place you were fond of

HORNBLOWER Not a bit But little considerations have to give way
to big ones Now missis Ill make it ten pounds and Ill send a
wagon to shift your things If that isnt fair Yed better
accept I shant keep it open

 The JACKMANS look at each other their faces show deep anger
 and the question they ask each other is which will speak

MRS J We wont take it eh George

JACKMAN Not a farden We come there when we was married

HORNBLOWER Throwing out his finger Yere very improvident folk

HILLCRIST Dont lecture them Mr Hornblower they come out of
this miles above you

HORNBLOWER Angry Well I was going to give ye another week but
yell go out next Saturday and take care yere not late or your
thingsll be put out in the rain

MRS H To MRS JACKMAN Well send down for your things and you
can come to us for the time being

 MRS JACKMAN drops a curtsey her eyes stab HORNBLOWERS

JACKMAN Heavily clenching his fists Youre no gentleman
Dont put temptation in my way thats all

HILLCRIST In a low voice Jackman

HORNBLOWER Triumphantly Ye hear that Thats your protegee
Keep out o my way me man or Ill put the police on to ye for
utterin threats

HILLCRIST Youd better go now Jackman

 The JACKMANS move to the door

MRS J Turning Maybe youll repent it some day sir

 They go out MRS HILLCRIST following

HORNBLOWER Weell Im sorry theyre such unreasonable folk I
never met people with less notion of which side their bread was
buttered

HILLCRIST And I never met anyone so pachydermatous

HORNBLOWER Whats that in Heavens name Ye needn wrap it up in
long words now your good ladys gone

HILLCRIST With dignity Im not going in for a slanging match
I resent your conduct much too deeply

HORNBLOWER Look here Hillcrist I dont object to you personally
ye seem to me a poor creature thats bound to get left with your
gout and your dignity but of course ye can make yourself very
disagreeable before yere done Now I want to be the movin spirit
here Im full of plans Im goin to stand for Parliament Im
goin to make this a prosperous place Im a goodmatured man if
youll treat me as such Now you take me on as a neighbour and all
that and Ill manage without chimneys on the Centry Is it a
bargain He holds out his hand

HILLCRIST Ignoring it I thought you said you didnt keep your
word when it suited you to break it

HORNBLOWER Now dont get on the high horse You and me could be
very good friends but I can be a very nasty enemy The chimneys
will not look nice from that windie ye know

HILLCRIST Deeply angry Mr Hornblower if you think Ill take
your hand after this Jackman business youre greatly mistaken You
are proposing that I shall stand in with you while you tyrannise
over the neighbourhood Please realise that unless you leave those
tenancies undisturbed as you said you would we dont know each
other

HORNBLOWER Well that wont trouble me much Now yed better
think it over yeve got gout and that makes ye hasty I tell ye
again Im not the man to make an enemy of Unless yere friendly
sure as I stand here Ill ruin the look of your place

 The toot of a car is heard

Theres my car I sent Chearlie and his wife in it to buy the
Centry And make no mistakehes got it in his packet Its your
last chance Hillcrist Im not averse to you as a man I think
yere the best of the fossils round here at least I think ye can
do me the most harm socially Come now

 He holds out his hand again

HILLCRIST Not if youd bought the Centry ten times over Your
ways are not mine and Ill have nothing to do with you

HORNBLOWER Very angry Really Is that so Very well Now
yere goin to learn something an its time ye did Dye realise
that Im very nearly round ye He draws a circle slowly in the
air Im at Uphill the works are here heres Longmeadow heres
the Centry that Ive just bought theres only the Common left to
give ye touch with the world Now between you and the Common
theres the high road

I come out on the high road here to your north and I shall come out
on it there to your west When Ive got me new works up on the
Centry I shall be makin a trolley track between the works up to
the road at both ends so any goods will be running right round ye
Howll ye like that for a country place

 For answer HILLCRIST who is angry beyond the power of speech
 walks forgetting to use his stick up to the French window
 While he stands there with his back to HORNBLOWER the door L
 is flung open and Jim enters preceding CHARLES his wife
 CHLOE and ROLF CHARLES is a goodishlooking moustached
 young man of about twentyeight with a white rim to the collar
 of his waistcoat and spats He has his hand behind CHLOES
 back as if to prevent her turning tail She is rather a
 handsome young woman with dark eyes full red lips and a
 suspicion of powder a little underdressed for the country
 ROLF mho brings up the rear is about twenty with an open
 face and stiffish buttercoloured hair JILL runs over to her
 father at the window She has a bottle

JILL Sotto voce Look Dodo Ive brought the lot Isnt it a
treat dear Papa And heres the stuff Hallo

 The exclamation is induced by the apprehension that there has
 been a row HILLCRIST gives a stiff little bow remaining
 where he is in the window JILL stays close to him staring
 from one to the other then blocks him off and engages him in
 conversation CHARLES has gone up to his father who has
 remained maliciously still where he delivered his last speech
 CHLOE and ROLF stand awkwardly waiting between the fireplace
 and the door

HORNBLOWER Well Chearlie

CHARLES Not got it

HORNBLOWER Not

CHARLES Id practically got her to say shed sell at three
thousand five hundred when that fellow Dawker turned up

HORNBLOWER That bullterrier of a chap Why he was here a while
ago Ohho So thats it

CHARLES I heard him gallop up He came straight for the old lady
and got her away What he said I dont know but she came back
looking wiser than an owl said shed think it over thought she had
other views

HORNBLOWER Did ye tell her she might have her price

CHARLES Practically I did

HORNBLOWER Well

CHARLES Shut up Rolf

HORNBLOWER Turning on ROLF Ha Heres a league o Youth My

my house then

JILL Free speech Mr Hornblower dont be violent

HORNBLOWER Ah So ye put your dog on to it He throws out his
finger at DAWKERS Very smart thatI give ye credit

MRS H Pointing to CHLOE who has stood by herself forgotten and
uncomfortable throughout the scene
May I ask who this lady is

 CHLOE turns round startled and her vanity bag slips down her
 dress to the floor

HORNBLOWER No maam ye may not for ye know perfectly well

JILL I brought her in mother She moves to CHLOEs side

MRS H Will you take her out again then

HILLCRIST Amy have the goodness to remember

 passing her eyes with a queer halfscarred expression from
 MRS HILLCRIST to DAWKER

 To CHLOE Im awfully sorry Come on

 They go out Left ROLF hurries after them

CHARLES Youve insulted my wife Why What do you mean by it

 MRS HILLCRIST simply smiles

HILLCRIST I apologise I regret extremely There is no reason

 doorway

HILLCRIST Well Dawker

DAWKER Grinning Safe for the moment The old ladyll put it up
to auction Couldnt get her to budge from that Says she dont
want to be unneighbourly to either But if you ask me its money

JILL Advancing Now mother

MRS H Well

JILL Why did you insult her

JILL Why Even if she is Old Combustions daughterinlaw

MRS H My dear Jill allow me to judge the sort of acquaintances I

HILLCRIST Dawker if you dont mind

 DAWKER with a nod passes away out of the French window

MRS H You dont know what youre talking about

HILLCRIST Whats the matter with young Mrs Hornblower

 She looks coldly at JILL and goes out through the French
 window

HILLCRIST Youve thoroughly upset your mother Jill

JILL Its something Dawkers told her I saw them I dont like

HILLCRIST My dear we cant all be uncommon Hes got lots of go

HILLCRIST Arent you fond of your home

JILL Of course I love it

HILLCRIST Well you wont be able to live in it unless we stop
that ruffian Chimneys and smoke the trees cut down piles of
pots Every kind of abomination There He points Imagine
He points through the French window as if he could see those
chimneys rising and marring the beauty of the fields I was born
here and my father and his and his and his They loved those
fields and those old trees And this barbarian with his
improvement schemes forsooth I learned to ride in the Centry
meadowsprettiest spring meadows in the world Ive climbed every
tree there Why my father ever sold But who could have
imagined this And come at a bad moment when moneys scarce

JILL Cuddling his arm Dodo

HILLCRIST Yes But you dont love the place as I do Jill You
youngsters dont love anything I sometimes think

JILL I do Dodo I do

HILLCRIST Youve got it all before you But you may live your
life and never find anything so good and so beautiful as this old
home Im not going to have it spoiled without a fight

 Conscious of batting betrayed Sentiment he walks out at the
 French window passing away to the right JILL following to
 the window looks Then throwing back her head she clasps her
 hands behind it

JILL Ohohoh

 A voice behind her says JILL She turns and starts back
 leaning against the right lintel of the window ROLF appears
 outside the window from Left

Who goes there

ROLE Buttressed against the Left lintel Enemyafter Chloes
bag

JILL Pass enemy And alls ill

 ROLF passes through the window and retrieves the vanity bag
 from the floor where CHLOE dropped it then again takes his
 stand against the Left lintel of the French window

ROLF Its not going to make any difference is it

JILL You know it is

ROLF Sins of the fathers

JILL Unto the third and fourth generations What sin has my
father committed

ROLF None in a way only Ive often told you I dont see why you
should treat us as outsiders We dont like it

JILL Well you shouldnt be then I mean he shouldnt be

ROLF Fathers just as human as your father hes wrapped up in us
and all his getting on is for us Would you like to be treated as
your mother treated Chloe Your mothers set the stroke for the
other bigwigs about here nobody calls on Chloe And why not Why
not I think its contemptible to bar people just because theyre
new as you call it and have to make their position instead of
having it left them

JILL Its not because theyre new its becauseif your father
behaved like a gentleman hed be treated like one

ROLF Would he I dont believe it My fathers a very able man
he thinks hes entitled to have influence here Well everybody
tries to keep him down Oh yes they do That makes him mad and
more determined than ever to get his way You ought to be just
Jill

JILL I am just

ROLF No youre not Besides whats it got to do with Charlie
and Chloe Chloes particularly harmless Its pretty sickening
for her Father didnt expect people to call until Charlie married
but since

JILL I think its all very petty

ROLF It isa doginthemanger business I did think you were
above it

JILL How would you like to have your home spoiled

ROLE Im not going to argue Only things dont stand still
Homes arent any more proof against change than anything else

JILL All right You come and try and take ours

ROLF We dont want to take your home

JILL Like the Jackmans

ROLF All right I see youre hopelessly prejudiced

 He turns to go

JILL Just as he is vanishingsoftly Enemy

ROLF Turning Yes enemy

JILL Before the battlelets shake hands

 They move from the lintels and grasp each others hands in the
 centre of the French window


 CURTAIN




ACT II


SCENE I

 A billiard room in a provincial hotel where things are bought
 and sold The scene is set well forward and is not very
 broad it represents the auctioneers end of the room having
 rather to stage Left a narrow table with two chairs facing the
 audience where the auctioneer will sit and stand The table
 which is set forward to the footlights is littered with
 greencovered particulars of sale The audience are in effect
 public and bidders There is a door on the Left level with the
 table Along the back wall behind the table are two raised
 benches with two steps up to them such as billiard rooms often
 have divided by a door in the middle of a wall which is
 panelled in oak Late September sunlight is coming from a
 skylight not visible on to these seats The stage is empty
 when the curtain goes up but DAWKERS and MRS HILLCRIST are
 just entering through the door at the back

DAWKER Be out of their way here maam See old Hornblower with
Chearlie

 He points down to the audience

MRS H It begins at three doesnt it

DAWKER They wont be overpunctual theres only the Centry

Pointing over at the entrance Ive got that chap I told you of

fatal

DAWKER Nodding Thats right maam Lot of peopledalways

agents here shouldnt be surprised if he chipped in

MRS H Where did you leave my husband

DAWKER With Miss Jill in the courtyard Hes coming to you In

money away

MRS H Thats a fearful price Well good luck to you Dawker

DAWKER Good luck maam Ill go and see to that little matter of
Mrs Chloe Never fear well do them is somehow

 He winks lays his finger on the side of his nose and goes
 out at the door

 MRS HILLCRIST mounts the two steps sits down Right of the
 door and puts up a pair of longhandled glasses Through the
 door behind her come CHLOE and ROLF She makes a sign for him
 to go and shuts the door

CHLOE At the foot of the steps in the gangwaywith a slightly
common accent Mrs Hillcrist

MRS H Not quite starting I beg your pardon

CHLOE Again Mrs Hillcrist

MRS H Well

CHLOE I never did you any harm

MRS H Did I ever say you did

CHLOE No but you act as if I had

CHLOE II have tried

MRS H Looking at her Oh I suppose such men dont pay
attention to what women ask them

CHLOE With a flash of spirit Im fond of my husband I

MRS H Looking at her steadily I dont quite know why you spoke
to me

CHLOE With a sort of pathetic sullenness I only thought perhaps
youd like to treat me as a human being

MRS H Really if you dont mind I should like to be left alone
just now

CHLOE Unhappily acquiescent Certainly Ill go to the other
end

 She moves to the Left mounts the steps and sits down

 ROLF looking in through the door and seeing where she is
 joins her MRS HILLCRIST resettles herself a little further
 in on the Right

ROLF Bending over to CHLOE after a glance at MRS HILLCRIST
Are you all right

CHLOE Its awfully hot

 She fans herself wide the particulars of sale

ROLF Theres Dawker I hate that chap

CHLOE Where

ROLF Down there see

 He points down to stage Right of the room

CHLOE Drawing back in her seat with a little gasp Oh

ROLF Not noticing Whos that next him looking up here

CHLOE I dont know

 She has raised her auction programme suddenly and sits
 fanning herself carefully screening her face

ROLE Looking at her Dont you feel well Shall I get you some
water He gets up at her nod

 As he reaches the door HILLCRIST and JILL come in HILLCRIST
 passes him abstractedly with a nod and sits down beside his
 wife

JILL To ROLF Come to see us turned out

ROLF Emphatically No Im looking after Chloe shes not well

JILL Glancing at her Sorry She neednt have come I suppose
 RALF deigns no answer and goes out

 JILL glances at CHLOE then at her parents talking in low
 voices and sits down next her father who makes room for her

HILLCRIST Three minutes to three

JILL Dont you feel beastly all down the backs of your legs

 He feels in his breast pocket and pulls up the edge of his
 handkerchief

JILL Oh Look Theres Miss Mullins at the back just come in

nature Phew I used to feel like this before a viva voce
Whos that next to Dawker

JILL What a fish

MRS H To herself Ah yes

 Her eyes slide round at CHLOE silting motionless and rather
 sunk in her seat slowly fanning herself with they particulars

HILLCRIST Taking the salts Thank God for a human touch

MRS H Taken aback Oh

JILL With a quick look at her mother snatching the salts I

CHLOE Looking up startled Oh no thanks Im all right

JILL No do You must CHLOE takes them

JILL Dyou mind letting me see that a minute

 She takes the particulars of the sale and studies it but
 CHLOE has buried the lower part of her face in her hand and the
 smelling salts bottle

Beastly hot isnt it Youd better keep that

CHLOE Her dark eyes wandering and uneasy Rolfs getting me some
water

JILL Why do you stay You didnt want to come did you

 CHLOE shakes her head

All right Heres your water

 She hands back the particulars and slides over to her seat
 passing ROLF in the gangway with her chin well up

 MRS HILLCRIST who has watched CHLOE and JILL and DAWKER and
 his friend makes an enquiring movement with her hand but gets
 a disappointing answer

JILL Whats the time Dodo

HILLCRIST Looking at his watch Three minutes past

JILL Sighing Oh hell

HILLCRIST Jill

JILL Sorry Dodo I was only thinking Look Here he is
Phewisnt he

MRS H Sh

 The AUCTIONEER comes in Left and goes to the table He is a
 square short brownfaced common looking man with clipped
 grey hair fitting him like a cap and a clipped grey moustache
 His lids come down over his quick eyes till he can see you
 very sharply and you can hardly see that he can see you He
 can break into a smile at any moment which has no connection
 with him as it were By a certain hurt look however when
 bidding is slow he discloses that he is not merely an
 auctioneer but has in him elements of the human being He can
 wink with anyone and is dressed in a snugbrown suit with a
 perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat a low turned down collar and
 small black and white sailor knot tie While he is settling
 his papers the HILLCRISTS settle themselves tensely CHLOE
 has drunk her water and leaned back again with the smelling
 salts to her nose ROLF leans forward in the seat beside her
 looking sideways at JILL A SOLICITOR with a grey beard has
 joined the AUCTIONEER at his table

 He sits down and gives two little tape on the table

 The SOLICITOR rises and reads the conditions of sale in a
 voice which no one practically can hear Just as he begins to
 read these conditions of sale CHARLES HORNBLOWER enters at
 back He stands a moment glancing round at the HILLCRIST and
 twirling his moustache then moves along to his wife and
 touches her

CHARLES Chloe arent you well

 In the start which she gives her face is fully revealed to

 Mrs H If you had a son tricked into marrying such a woman
 would you wish to remain ignorant of it

HILLCRIST Struck I dont knowI dont know

MRS H At least youd like to be in a position to help him if
you thought it necessary

HILLCRIST Wellthat perhaps

MRS H Then you agree that Mr Hornblower at least should be told
What he does with the knowledge is not our affair

HILLCRIST Half to the STRANGER and half to DAWKER Do you realise
that an imputation of that kind may be ground for a criminal libel
action

STRANGER Quite But theres no shadow of doubt not the faintest
You saw her just now

HILLCRIST I did Revolting again No I dont like it

 DAWKER has drawn the STRANGER a step or two away and they
 talk together

MRS H In a low voice And the ruin of our home Youre
betraying your fathers Jack

HILLCRIST I cant bear bringing a woman into it

MRS H We dont If anyone brings her in it will be Hornblower
himself

HILLCRIST We use her secret as a lever

MRS H I tell you quite plainly I will only consent to holding my
tongue about her if you agree to Hornblower being told Its a
scandal to have a woman like that in the neighbourhood

JILL Mother means that father

 peers at CHLOE vanishes and the door is closed CHLOE raises
 her hands covers her eyes with them drops them with a quick
 gesture and looks round her A knock With a swift movement

 ANNA inclines her head and goes out

 CHLOE with a sort of moan turns over and buries her face in
 the cushion

CHLOE Sitting up If I could see that manif onlyor Dawker

 She springs up and goes to the door but hesitates and comes
 back to the head of the sofa as ROLF comes in During this
 scene the door is again opened stealthily an inch or too

 tissue paper parcel She counts the notes Three hundred
 Slips them into her breast and unwraps the little parcel It
 contains pears She slips them too into her dress looks
 round startled replaces the drawer and regains her place on
 the sofa lying prostrate as the door opens and HORNBLOWER

 her a moment before speaking

HORNBLOWER Almost softly How are ye feelin Chloe

CHLOE Awful head

HORNBLOWER Can ye attend a moment Ive had a note from that
woman

 CHLOE sits up

HORNBLOWER Reading I have something of the utmost importance

utterly vital to the happiness of all your family that I cannot

Theres nothing else before I answer her

 CHLOE shakes her head

CHLOE With an effort She may invent things of course

HORNBLOWER Lost in his feud feeling Ah but theres such a
thing as the laws o slander If they play pranks Ill have them

CHLOE Timidly Couldnt you stop this quarrel father You said

HORNBLOWER Stop it Now Ive bought Na no The snobs defied

HORNBLOWER Hes a part of the whole doginthemanger system that
stands in my way Yere a woman and ye dont understand these
things Ye wouldnt believe the struggle Ive had to make my money
and get my position These county folk talk soft sawder but to get
anything from thems like gettin butter out of a dogs mouth If
they could drive me out of here by fair means or foul would they
hesitate a moment Not they See what theyve made me pay and
look at this letter Selfish mean lot o hypocrites

CHLOE But they didnt begin the quarrel

HORNBLOWER Not openly but underneath they didthats their way
They began it by thwartin me here and there and everywhere just
because Ive come into me own a bit later than they did I gave em
their chance and they wouldnt take it Well Ill show em what a
man like me can do when he sets his mind to it Ill not leave much
skin on them

 In the intensity of his feeling he has lost sight of her face
 alive with a sort of agony of doubt whether to plead with him
 further or what to do Then with a swift glance at her
 wristwatch she falls back on the sofa and closes her eyes

Itll give me a power of enjoyment seein me chimneys go up in front
of their windies That was a bonnie thoughtthat last bid o mine
Hed got that roused up I believe he never would a stopped
Looking at her I forgot your head Well well yell be best

CHLOE No Ill try to sleep Please tell them I dont want to be
disturbed

HORNBLOWER All right Ill just answer this note

 He sits down at her writingtable

 CHLOE starts up from the sofa feverishly looking at her
 watch at the window at her watch then softly crosses to the
 window and opens it

HORNBLOWER Finishing Listen He turns round towards the sofa
Hallo Where are ye

CHLOE At the window Its so hot

HORNBLOWER Heres what Ive said

 MADAMYou can tell me nothing of my daughterinlaw which
 can affect the happiness of my family I regard your note as
 an impertinence and I shall not be with you at eleven oclock

CHLOE With a suffering movement of her head OhWellThe
gong is touched a second time

HORNBLOWER Crossing to the door Lie ye down and get a sleep
Ill tell them not to disturb ye and I hope yell be all right
tomorrow Goodnight Chloe

CHLOE Goodnight He goes out

 After a feverish turn or two CHLOE returns to the open window
 and waits there half screened by the curtains The door is
 opened inch by inch and ANNAS head peers round Seeing where
 CHLOE is she slips in and passes behind the screen Left
 Suddenly CHLOE backs in from the window

CHLOE In a low voice Come in

 She darts to the door and locks it

 DAWKER has come in through the window and stands regarding her
 with a half smile

DAWKER Well young woman what do you want of me

 In the presence of this man of her own class there comes a
 distinct change in CHLOES voice and manner a sort of frank
 commonness adapted to the man she is dealing with but she
 keeps her voice low

CHLOE Youre making a mistake you know

DAWKER With a broad grin No Ive got a memory for faces

CHLOE I say you are

DAWKER Turning to go If thats all you neednt have troubled
me to come

CHLOE No Dont go With a faint smile You are playing a game

 is like wood

CHLOE Panting Ah do You might Youve been fond of some
woman I suppose Think of her

DAWKER Decisively It wont do Mrs Chloe Youre a pawn in
the game and Im going to use you

CHLOE Despairingly What is it to you With a sudden touch of
the tigress Look here Dont you make an enemy of me I havent

theyll love and find out that its hanging on a thread andand
Oh you coward you persecuting coward Call yourself a man

DAWKER With his grin Ah You look quite pretty like that By
George youre a handsome woman when youre roused

 CHLOES passion fades out as quickly as it blazed up She
 sinks down on the sofa shudders looks here and there and
 then for a moment up at him

CHLOE Is there anything youll take not to spoil my life
Clasping her hands on her breast under her breath Me

DAWKER Wiping his brow By God Thats an offer He recoils
towards the window Youyou touched me there Look here Ive

 While he is again embracing her ANNA steals from behind the
 screen to the door opens it noiselessly and passes through
 but it clicks as she shuts it

CHLOE Starting violently Ohh

CHARLES What is it What is it You are nervy my dear

CHLOE Looking round with a little laugh I dont know Go on
Charlie Ill be all right when this heads gone

CHARLES Stroking her forehead and looking at her doubtfully

 He turn and goes blowing a kiss from the doorway When he
 is gone CHLOE gets up and stands in precisely the attitude in
 which she stood at the beginning of the Act thinking and
 thinking And the door is opened and the face of the MAID
 peers round at her

SCENE II


 When it rises again the room is empty and dark same for
 moonlight coming in through the French window which is open

 The figure of CHLOE in a black cloak appears outside in the
 moonlight she peers in moves past comes bank hesitatingly
 enters The cloak fallen back reveals a white evening dress
 and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in the dim
 light then flaps unhappily Left and Right as if she could not
 keep still Suddenly she stands listening

ROLFS VOICE Outside Chloe Chloe

 He appears

CHLOE Going to the window What are you doing here

ROLF What are you I only followed you

CHLOE Go away

ROLF Whats the matter Tell me

CHLOE Go away and dont say anything Oh The roses She has
put her nose into some roses in a bowl on a big stand close to the
window Dont they smell lovely

ROLF What did Jill want this afternoon

CHLOE Ill tell you nothing Go away

ROLF I dont like leaving you here in this state

CHLOE What state Im all right Wait for me down in the drive
if you want to

 ROLF starts to go stops looks at her and does go CHLOE
 with a little moaning sound flutters again magpielike up
 and down then stands by the window listening Voices are
 heard Left She darts out of the window and away to the
 Right as HILLCRIST and JILL come in They have turned up the
 electric light and come down in frond of the fireplace where
 HILLCRIST sits in an armchair and JILL on the arm of it They
 are in undress evening attire

HILLCRIST Now tell me

JILL There isnt much Dodo I was in an awful funk for fear I
should meet any of the others and of course I did meet Rolf but I
told him some lie and he took me to her roomboudoir they call it
isnt boudoir a dugout word

HILLCRIST Meditatively The sulking room Well

JILL She was sitting like this She buries her chin in her
hands wide her elbows on her knees And she said in a sort of
fierce way What do you want And I said Im awfully sorry but
I thought you might like it

HILLCRIST Well

JILL She looked at me hard and said I suppose you know all
about it And I Said Only vaguely because of course I dont
And she said Well it was decent of you to come Dodo she looks
like a lost soul What has she done

HILLCRIST She committed her real crime when she married young
Hornblower without telling him She came out of a certain world to
do it

JILL Oh Staring in front of her Is it very awful in that
world Dodo

HILLCRIST Uneasy I dont know Jill Some can stand it I
suppose some cant I dont know which sort she is

JILL One thing Im sure of shes awfully fond of Chearlie

HILLCRIST Thats bad thats very bad

JILL And shes frightened horribly I think shes desperate

HILLCRIST Women like that are pretty tough Jill dont judge her
too much by your own feelings

JILL No onlyOh it was beastly and of course I dried up

HILLCRIST Feelingly Hm One always does But perhaps it was
as well youd have been blundering in a dark passage

JILL I just said Father and I feel awfully sorry if theres
anything we can do

HILLCRIST That was risky Jill

JILL Disconsolately I had to say something Im glad I went
anyway I feel more human

HILLCRIST We had to fight for our home I should have felt like a
traitor if I hadnt

JILL Im not enjoying home tonight Dodo

HILLCRIST I never could hate proper its a confounded nuisance

JILL Mothers fearfully bucked and Dawkers simply oozing
triumph I dont trust him Dodo hes toonot pugilisticthe
other one with a pugnaceous

HILLCRIST He is rather

JILL Im sure he wouldnt care tuppence if Chloe committed
suicide

HILLCRIST Rising uneasily Nonsense Nonsense

JILL I wonder if mother would

HILLCRIST Turning his face towards the window Whats that I
thought I heardLouderIs these anybody out there

 No answer JILL springs up and runs to the window

JILL You

 She dives through to the Right and returns holding CHLOES
 hand and drawing her forward

Come in Its only us To HILLCRIST Dodo

HILLCRIST Flustered but making a show of courtesy Good
evening Wont you sit down

JILL Sit down youre all shaky

 She makes CHLOE sit down in the armchair out of which they
 have risen then locks the door and closing the windows draws
 the curtains hastily over them

HILLCRIST Awkward and expectant Can I do anything for you

CHLOE I couldnt bear it hes coming to ask you

HILLCRIST Who

CHLOE My husband She draws in her breath with a long shudder
then seem to seize her courage in her hands Ive got to be quick
He keeps on askinghe knows theres something

HILLCRIST Make your mind easy We shant tell him

CHLOE Appealing Oh thats not enough Cant you tell him
something to put him back to thinking its all right Ive done him
such a wrong I didnt realise till afterI thought meeting him
was just a piece of wonderful good luck after what Id been
through Im not such a bad lotnot really

 She stops from the overquivering of her lips JILL standing
 beside the chair strokes her shoulder HILLCRIST stands very
 still painfully biting at a finger

You see my father went bankrupt and I was in a shop

HILLCRIST Soothingly and to prevent disclosures Yes yes Yes
yes

CHLOE I never gave a man away or did anything I was ashamed ofat
leastI mean I had to make my living in all sorts of ways and
then I met Charlie

 Again she stopped from the quivering of her lips

JILL Its all right

CHLOE He thought I was respectable and that was such a relief
you cant think soso I let him

JILL Dodo Its awful

HILLCRIST It is

CHLOE And after I married him you see I fell in love If I had
before perhaps I wouldnt have dared only I dont knowyou never
know do you When theres a straw going you catch at it

JILL Of course you do

CHLOE And now you see Im going to have a child

JILL Aghast Oh Are you

HILLCRIST Good God

CHLOE Dully Ive been on hot bricks all this month ever since
that day here I knew it was in the wind What gets in the wind
never gets out She rises and throws out her arms Never It
just blows here and there Desolately and thenblows home Her
voice changes to resentment But Ive paid for being a fool
tisnt fun that sort of life I can tell you Im not ashamed and
repentant and all that If it wasnt for him Im afraid hell
never forgive me its such a disgrace for himand then to have
his child Being fond of him I feel it much worse than anything I
ever felt and thats saying a good bit It is

JILL Energetically Look here He simply mustnt find out

CHLOE Thats it but its started and hes bound to keep on
because he knows theres something A man isnt going to be
satisfied when theres something he suspects about his wife Charlie
wouldnt never Hes clever and hes jealous and hes coming
here

 She stops and looks round wildly listening

JILL Dodo what can we say to put him clean off the scent

HILLCRIST Anythingin reason

CHLOE Catching at this straw You will You see I dont know
what Ill do Ive got soft being looked afterhe does love me
And if he throws me off Ill go underthats all

HILLCRIST Have you any suggestion

CHLOE Eagerly The only thing is to tell him something positive
something hell believe thats not too badlike my having been a
lady clerk with those people who came here and having been
dismissed on suspicion of taking money I could get him to believe
that wasnt true

JILL Yes and it isntthats splendid Youd be able to put
such conviction into it Dont you think so Dodo

HILLCRIST Anything I can Im deeply sorry

CHLOE Thank you And dont say Ive been here will you Hes
very suspicious You see he knows that his father has resold that
land to you thats what he cant make outthat and my coming here
this morning he knows somethings being kept from him and he
noticed that man with Dawker yesterday And my maids been spying
on me Its in the air He puts two and two together But Ive
told him theres nothing he need worry about nothing thats true

HILLCRIST What a coil

CHLOE Im very honest and careful about money So he wont
believe that about me and the old man wants to keep it from
Charlie I know

HILLCRIST That does seem the best way out

CHLOE With a touch of defiance Im a true wife to him

CHLOE Of course we know that

HILLCRIST Its all unspeakably sad Deceptions horribly against
the grainbut

CHLOE Eagerly When I deceived him Id have deceived God
HimselfI was so desperate Youve never been right down in the
mud You cant understand what Ive been through

HILLCRIST Yes Yes I daresay Id have done the same I should
be the last to judge

 CHLOE covers her eyes with her hands

There there Cheer up He puts his hand on her arm

CHLOE To herself Darling Dodo

CHLOE Starting Theres somebody at the door I must go I must
go

 She runs to the window and slips through the curtains

 The handle of the door is again turned

JILL Dismayed Oh Its lockedI forgot

 She spring to the door unlocks and opens it while HILLCRIST
 goes to the bureau and sits down

Its all right Fellows I was only saying something rather
important

FELLOWS Coming in a step or two and closing the door behind him
Certainly Miss Mr Charles Ornblower is in the hall Wants to
see you sir or Mrs Hillcrist

JILL What a bore Can you see him Dodo

HILLCRIST Eryes I suppose so Show him in here Fellows

 As FELLOWS goes out JILL runs to the window but has no time
 to do more than adjust the curtains and spring over to stand by
 her father before CHARLES comes in Though in evening
 clothes he is white and disheveled for so spruce a young
 mean

CHARLES No Go on

HILLCRIST Moistening his lips It appears Mr Hornblower that

 CHARLES who is breathing hard utters a sound of anger

that my agent happens to know a firm who in old days employed
your wife I should greatly prefer not to say any more especially
as we dont believe the story

JILL No we dont

CHARLES Go on

HILLCRIST Getting up Come If I were you I should refuse to
listen to anything against my wife

CHARLES Go on I tell you

HILLCRIST You insist Well they say there was some question
about the accounts and your wife left them under a cloud As I

CHARLES Passionately Liars

 He makes a rush for the door

JILL Catching his arm Dodo Sotto voce We are you know

CHARLES Turning back to them Why do you tell me that lie When
Ive just had the truth out of that little scoundrel My wifes

 The face of CHLOE is seen transfixed between the curtains
 parted by her hands

Sheshe put you up to it Liar that she isa living lie For
three years a living lie

 HILLCRIST whose face alone is turned towards the curtains
 sees that listening face His hand goes up from uncontrollable
 emotion

And hasnt now the pluck to tell me Ive done with her I wont
own a child by such a woman

 With a little sighing sound CHLOE drops the curtain and
 vanishes

HILLCRIST For Gods sake man think of what youre saying Shes
in great distress

JILL She loves you you know

CHARLES Pretty love That scoundrel Dawker told metold me

MRS H That has nothing to do with us Your son came and wrenched
the knowledge out of Mr DAWKER by abuse and threats that is all
You will kindly behave yourself here or I shall ask that you be
shown out

HORNBLOWER Give me that deed I say He suddenly turns on
DAWKER Ye little ruffian I see it in your pocket

 The end indeed is projecting from DAWKERS breast pocket

DAWKER Seeing red Now look ere Ornblower I stood a deal
from your son and Ill stand no more

HORNBLOWER To MRS HILLCRIST Ill ruin your place yet To
DAWKER Ye give me that deed or Ill throttle ye

 He closes on DAWKER and makes a snatch at the deed DAWKER
 springs at him and the two stand swaying trying for a grip at
 each others throats MRS HILLCRIST tries to cross and reach
 the bell but is shut off by their swaying struggle

 Suddenly ROLF appears in the window looks wildly at the
 struggle and seizes DAWKERS hands which have reached
 HORNBLOWERS throat JILL who is following rushes up to him
 and clutches his arm

JILL Rolf All of you Stop Look

 DAWKERS hand relaxes and he is swung round HORNBLOWER
