HIS OWN PEOPLE

by Booth Tarkington





I A Change of Lodging

The glassdomed palmroom of the Grand Continental Hotel Magnifique in
Rome is of vasty heights and distances filled with a mellow green light
which filters down languidly through the upper foliage of tall palms
so that the two hundred people who may be refreshing or displaying
themselves there at the teahour have something the look of underwater
creatures playing upon the seabed They appear however to be unaware
of their condition even the ladies most like anemones of that
gay assembly do not seem to know it and when the Hungarian band
crustaceanlike in costume and therefore well within the picture
has sheathed its flying tentacles and withdrawn by dim processes the
teadrinkers all float out through the doors instead of bubbling up
and away through the filmy roof In truth some such exit as that was
imagined for them by a young man who remained in the aquarium after they
had all gone late one afternoon of last winter They had been marvelous
enough and to him could have seemed little more so had they made such a
departure He could almost have gone that way himself so charged was
he with the uplift of his belief that in spite of the brilliant
strangeness of the hour just past he had been no fish out of water

While the waiters were clearing the little tables he leaned back in his
chair in a content so rich it was nearer ecstasy He could not bear to
disturb the possession joy had taken of him and like a halfawake boy
clinging to a dream that his hitherto unkind sweetheart has kissed him
lingered on in the enchanted atmosphere his eyes still full of all they
had beheld with such delight detaining and smiling upon each revelation
of this fresh memorythe flashingly lovely faces the dreamily lovely
faces the pearls and laces of the anemone ladies the color and
romantic fashion of the uniforms and the old princes who had been
pointed out to him splendid old men wearing white mustaches and single
eyeglasses as he had so long hoped and dreamed they did

Mine own people he whispered I have come unto mine own at last
Mine own people After long waiting he told himself he had seen
themthe people he had wanted to see wanted to know wanted to
be _of_ Ever since he had begun to read of the beau monde in his
schooldays he had yearned to know some such sumptuous reality as that
which had come true today when at last in Rome he had seenas he
wrote home that nightthe finest essence of OldWorld society mingling
in Cosmopolis

Artificial odors too heavy to keep up with the crowd that had
worn them still hung about him he breathed them deeply his eyes
halfclosed and his lips noiselessly formed themselves to a quotation
from one of his own poems

 While trails of scent like cobwebs films
 Slender and faint and rare
 Of roses and rich fair fabrics
 Cling on the stirless air
 The sibilance of voices
 At a wave of Miladys glove
 Is stilled

He stopped short interrupting himself with a halfcough of laughter as
he remembered the inspiration of these verses He had written them three
months ago at home in Cranston Ohio the evening after Anna McCords
comingout tea Milady meant Mrs McCord she had stilled the
conversation of her guests when Mary Kramer whom the poem called a
sweet pale singer rose to sing Mavourneen and the stanza closed
with the right word to rhyme with glove He felt a contemptuous pity
for his little untraveled provincial self of three months ago if
indeed it could have been himself who wrote verses about Anna McCords
comingout tea and referred to poor good old Mrs McCord as Milady

The second stanza had intimated a conviction of a kind which only poets
may reveal

 She sang to that great assembly
 They thought as they praised her tone
 But she and my heart knew better
 Her song was for me alone

He had told the truth when he wrote of Mary Kramer as pale and sweet
and she was paler but no less sweet when he came to say goodby to
her before he sailed Her face as it was at the final moment of the
protracted farewell shone before him very clearly now for a moment
young plaintive white too lamentably honest to conceal how much her
Godspeed to him cost her He came very near telling her how fond of
her he had always been came near giving up his great trip to remain
with her always

Ah He shivered as one shivers at the thought of disaster narrowly
averted The fates were good that I only came near it

He took from his breastpocket an engraved card without having to
search for it because during the few days the card had been in his
possession the action had become a habit

Comtesse de Vaurigard was the name engraved and below was written in
pencil To remember Monsieur Robert Russ Mellin he promise to come to
tea Hotel Magnifique Roma at five oclock Thursday


There had been disappointment in the first stages of his journey and
that had gone hard with Mellin Europe had been his goal so long and
his hopes of pleasure grew so high when after his years of saving and
putting by bit by bit out of his salary in a realestate office
he drew actually near the shining horizon But London his first
stoppingplace had given him some dreadful days He knew nobody and
had not understood how heavily sheer lonelinesswhich was something he
had never felt until thenwould weigh upon his spirits In Cranston
where the young people grew up together and where he met a dozen
friends on the street in a halfhours walk he often said that he
liked to be alone with himself London after his first excitement in
merely being there taught him his mistake chilled him with weeks of
forbidding weather puzzled and troubled him

He was on his way to Paris when as he recorded in his journal a light
came into his life This illumination first shone for him by means of
one Cooley son and inheritor of all that had belonged to the late great
Cooley of Cooley Mills Connecticut Young Cooley a person of
cheery manners and bright waistcoats was one of Mellins few
seaacquaintances they had played shuffleboard together on the steamer
during odd halfhours when Mr Cooley found it possible to absent
himself from poker in the smokingroom and they encountered each other
again on the channel boat crossing to Calais

_Hey_ was Mr Cooleys lively greeting Im meetin lots of people
I know today You runnin over to Paris too Come up to the boatdeck
and meet the Countess de Vaurigard

Who said Mellin red with pleasure yet fearing that he did not hear
aright

The Countess de Vaurigard Queen met her in London Sneyd introduced
me to her You remember Sneyd on the steamer Baldish Englishmanred
nosedoesnt talk muchyounger brother of Lord Rugden so he says
Played poker some Well _yes_

I saw him I didnt meet him

You didnt miss a whole lot Fact is before we landed I almost had him
sized up for queer but when he introduced me to the Countess I saw my
mistake He must be the real thing _She_ certainly is You come along
up and see

So Mellin followed to make his bow before a thin dark charmingly
pretty young woman who smiled up at him from her deckchair through
an enhancing mystery of veils and presently he found himself sitting
beside her He could not help trembling slightly at first but he would
have giving a great deal if by some miraculous vision Mary Kramer and
other friends of his in Cranston could have seen him engaged in what he
thought of as conversational badinage with the Comtesse de Vaurigard

Both the lady and her name thrilled him He thought he remembered the
latter in Froissart it conjured up baronial halls and donjon keeps
rang resonantly in his mind like Let the portcullis fall At home he
had been wont to speak of the oldest families in Cranston complaining
of the invasions of new people into the social territory of the
McCords and Mellins and Kramersa pleasant conception which the
presence of a De Vaurigard revealed to him as a petty and shameful
fiction and yet his humility like his little fit of trembling was
of short duration for gay geniality of Madame de Vaurigard put him
amazingly at ease

At Calais young Cooley with a matterofcourse air and not seeming to
feel the need of asking permission accompanied her to a compartment
and Mellin walked with them to the steps of the coach where he paused
murmuring some words of farewell

Madame de Vaurigard turned to him with a prettily assumed dismay

What You stay at Calais she cried pausing with one foot on the step
to ascend Oh I am sorry for you Calais is terrible

No I am going on to Paris

So You have friens in another coach which you wish to be wiz

No no indeed he stammered hastily

Well my frien she laughed gayly wy don you come wiz us

Blushing he followed Cooley into the coach to spend five happy hours
utterly oblivious of the bright French landscape whirling by outside the
window

There ensued a month of conscientious sightseeing in Paris and that
unfriendly city afforded him only one glimpse of the Countess She
whizzed by him in a big touringcar one afternoon as he stood on an
isle of safety at the foot of the Champs Elysees Cooley was driving
the car The raffish elderly Englishman whose name Mellin knew
was Sneyd sat with him and beside Madame de Vaurigard in the tonneau
lolled a grosslooking manunmistakably an Americanwith a jovial
red smoothshaven face and several chins Brief as the glimpse was
Mellin had time to receive a distinctly disagreeable impression of this
person and to wonder how Heaven could vouchsafe the society of Madame
de Vaurigard to so coarse a creature

All the party were dressed as for the road gray with dust and to all
appearances in a merry mood Mellins heart gave a leap when he saw that
the Countess recognized him Her eyes shining under a white veil met
his for just the instant before she was quite by and when the machine
had passed a little handkerchief waved for a moment from the side of the
tonneau where she sat

With that he drew the full breath of Romance

He had always liked to believe that _grandes dames_ leaned back in
the luxurious upholstery of their victorias landaulettes daumonts or
automobiles with an air of inexpressible though languid hauteur The
Newport letter in the Cranston Telegraph often referred to it But
the gayety of that greeting from the Countess little handkerchief
was infinitely refreshing and Mellin decided that animation was more
becoming than hauteureven to a _grande dame_

That night he wrote almost without effort the verses published in the
Cranston Telegraph two weeks later They began

 _Marquise ma belle_ with your kerchief of
 lace
 Awave from your flying car
 And your slender hand

The hand to which he referred was the same which had arrested his
gondola and his heart simultaneously five days ago in Venice He was
on his way to the station when Madame de Vaurigards gondola shot out
into the Grand Canal from a narrow channel and at her signal both boats
paused

Ah but you fly away she cried lifting her eyebrows mournfully
as she saw the steamertrunk in his gondola You are goin return to
America

No Im just leaving for Rome

Well in three day _I_ am goin to Rome She clapped her hands
lightly and laughed You know this is three time we meet jus by
chance though that second time it was so quick_pff_ like thatwe
didnt talk much togezzer Monsieur Mellin she laughed again I think
we mus be friens Three timean we are both goin to Rome Monsieur
Mellin you believe in _Fate_

With a beating heart he did

Thence came the invitation to meet her at the Magnifique for tea and
the card she scribbled for him with a silver pencil She gave it with
the prettiest gesture leaning from her gondola to his as they parted
She turned again as the water between them widened and with her _Au
revoir_ offered him a faintly wistful smile to remember

All the way to Rome the noises of the train beat out the measure of his
Parisian verses

 _Marquise ma belle_ with your kerchief of
 lace
 Awave from your flying car

He came out of his reverie with a start A dozen men and women dressed
for dinner with a goldfish officer or two among them swam leisurely
through the aquarium on their way to the hotel restaurant They were the
same kind of people who had sat at the little tables for teapeople of
the great world thought Mellin no vulgar tourists or trippers among
them and he shuddered at the remembrance of his pension whither it was
time to return and its conscientious students of Baedeker its dingy
halls and permanent smell of cold food Suddenly a high resolve lit his
face he got his coat and hat from the brassandblue custodian in the
lobby and without hesitation entered the bureau

I m not quite satisfied where I am stayingwhere Im stopping that
is he said to the clerk I think Ill take a room here

Very well sir Where shall I send for your luggage

I shall bring it myself replied Mellin coldly in my cab

He did not think it necessary to reveal the fact that he was staying at
one of the cheaper pensions and it may be mentioned that this reticence
as well as the somewhat chilling yet careless manner of a gentleman
of the great world which he assumed when he returned with his trunk
and bag very substantially increased the rate put upon the room he
selected at the Magnifique However it was with great satisfaction
that he found himself installed in the hotel and he was too recklessly
exhilarated by doing what he called the right thing to waste any
time wondering what the right thing would do to the diminishing pad of
express checks he carried in the inside pocket of his waistcoat

Better live a fortnight like a gentleman he said as he tossed his
shoes into a buhl cabinet than vegetate like a tourist for a year

He had made his entrance into the great world and he meant to hold his
place in it as one to the manor born Its people should not find
him lacking he would wear their manner and speak their languageno
gaucherie should betray him no homely phrase escape his lips

This was the chance he had always hoped for and when he fell asleep
in his gorgeous canopied bed his soul was uplifted with happy
expectations





II Music on the Pincio

The following afternoon found him still in that enviable condition as
he stood listening to the music on the Pincian Hill He had it of rumor
that the Fashion of Rome usually took a turn there before it went to
tea and he had it from the lady herself that Madame de Vaurigard would
be there Presently she came reclining in a victoria the harness of
her horses flashing with gold in the sunshine She wore a long ermine
stole her hat was ermine she carried a muff of the same fur and
Mellin thought it a perfect finish to the picture that a dark gentleman
of an appearance most distinguished should be sitting beside her An
Italian noble surely

He saw the American at once nodded to him and waved her hand The
victoria went on a little way beyond the turn of the drive drew out of
the line of carriages and stopped

Ah Monsieur Mellin she cried as he came up I am glad I was so
foolish yesterday I didn give you the address of my little apartment
an I forgot to ask you what is your hotel I tol you I would come here
for my drive but still I might have lost you for ever See what many
people It is jus that Fate again

She laughed and looked to the Italian for sympathy in her kindly
merriment He smiled cordially upon her then lifted his hat and smiled
as cordially upon Mellin

I am so happy to fin myself in Rome that I forgetMadame de
Vaurigard went on_eversing_ But now I mus make sure not to lose
you What is your hotel

Oh the Magnifique Mellin answered carelessly I suppose everybody
that one knows stops there One does stop there when one is in Rome
doesnt one

Everybody go there for tea and to eat sometime but to _stay_ah
that is for the American she laughed That is for you who are all so
abomin_ab_ly rich She smiled to the Italian again and both of them
smiled beamingly on Mellin

But that isnt always our fault is it said Mellin easily

Aha You mean you are of the new generation of the yong American who
come over an try to spen these immense fortunethose _pile_your
father or your granfather make I know quite well Ah

Well he hesitated smiling I suppose it does look a little by way
of being like that

Wicked fellow She leaned forward and tapped his shoulder chidingly
with two fingers I know what you wish the mos in the worlyou
wish to get into mischief That is it No sir I will jus take you in
han

When will you take me he asked boldly

At this the pleasant murmur of laughterhalf actual and half
suggestedwith which she underlined the conversation became loud and
clear as she allowed her vivacious glance to strike straight into his
upturned eyes and answered

As long as a little turn roun the hill _now_ Cavaliere Corni

To Mellins surprise and delight the Italian immediately descended from
the victoria without the slightest appearance of irritation on
the contrary he was urbane to a fine degree and upon Madame de
Vaurigards formally introducing him to Mellin saluted the latter with
grave politeness expressing in good English a hope that they might meet
often When the American was installed at the Countess side she spoke
to the driver in Italian and they began to move slowly along the ilex
avenue the coachman reining his horses to a walk

You speak Italian she inquired

Oh not a great deal more than a smattering he replied airilya
truthful answer inasmuch as a vocabulary consisting simply of _quanty
costy_ and _troppo_ cannot be seriously considered much more than a
smattering Fortunately she made no test of his linguistic attainment
but returned to her former subject

Ah yes all the worl today know the new class of American she
said_your_ class Many year ago we have another class which Europe
didn like That was when the American was terrible He was thewhat
is that you calloh yes he make himself you say that is it My
frien he was abominable He brag he talk through the nose yes
and he was niggardly rich as he was But you you yong men of the new
generation you are gentlemen of the idleness you are aristocrats with
polish an with culture An yet you throw your money awayyes you
throw it to poor Europe as if to a beggar

No no he protested with an indulgent laugh which confessed that the
truth was really Yes yes

Your smile betray you she cried triumphantly More than jus bein
guilty of that fault I am goin to tell you of others You are not the
oletimewhat is it you sayAh yes the goodygoody I have
heard my great American frien Honorable Chanlair Pedlow call it the
Sondayschool Is it not Yes you are not the Sondayschool yong men
you an your class

No he said bestowing a long glance upon a stout nurse who
was sitting on a bench near the drive and attending to twins in a
perambulator No were not exactly dissenting parsons

Ah no She shook her head at him prettily You are wicked You are
up into all the mischief Have I not hear what wild sums you risk at
your game that poker You are famous for it

Oh we play he admitted with a reckless laugh and I suppose we do
play rather high

High she echoed _Souzands_ But that is not all Ha ha ha
naughty one Have I not observe you lookin at these pretty creature
the little contadinagirl an the poor ladies who have hire their
carriages for two lire to drive up and down the Pincio in their bes
dress an be admire by the yong American while the music play Which
one I wonder is it on whose wrist you would mos like to fasten a
bracelet of diamons Wicked I have watch you look at them

No no he interrupted earnestly I have not once looked away from
you I _could nt_ Their eyes met but instantly hers were lowered
the bright smile with which she had been rallying him faded and there
was a pause during which he felt that she had become very grave When
she spoke it was with a little quaver and the controlled pathos of
her voice was so intense that it evoked a sympathetic catch in his own
throat

But my frien if it should be that I cannot wish you to look so at
me or to speak so to me

I beg your pardon he exclaimed almost incoherently I didnt mean
to hurt your feelings I wouldnt do anything youd think ungentlemanly
for the world

Her eyes lifted again to his with what he had no difficulty in
recognizing as a look of perfect trust but behind that he perceived a
darkling sadness

I know it is true she murmuredI know But you see there are time
when a woman has sorrowsorrow of one kindwhen she mus be sure that
there is onlyonly rispec in the hearts of her friens

With that the intended revelation was complete and the young man
understood as clearly as if she had told him in so many words that she
was not a widow and that her husband was the cause of her sorrow His
quickened instinct marvelously divined or else it was conveyed to him
by some intangible method of hers that the Count de Vaurigard was a
very bad case but that she would not divorce him

I know he answered profoundly touched I understand

In silent gratitude she laid her hand for a second upon his sleeve Then
her face brightened and she said gayly

But we shall not talk of _me_ Let us see how we can keep you out of
mischief at leas for a little while I know very well what you will do
tonight you will go to Salone Margherita an sit in a box like all the
wicked Americans

No indeed I shall not

Ah yes you will she laughed But until dinner let me keep you from
wickedness Come to tea jus wiz me not at the hotel but at the little
apartment I have taken where it is quiet The music is finish an all
those pretty girl are goin away you see I am not selfish if I take
you from the Pincio now You will come





III Glamour

It was some fair dream that would be gone too soon he told himself as
they drove rapidly through the twilight streets down from the Pincio
and up the long slope of the Quirinal They came to a stop in the gray
courtyard of a palazzo and ascended in a sleepy elevator to the fifth
floor Emerging they encountered a tall man who was turning away
from the Countess door which he had just closed The landing was not
lighted and for a moment he failed to see the American following Madame
de Vaurigard

Eow its you is it he said informally Waitin a devil of a long
time for you Ive gawt a message for you _Hes_ comin He writes that
Cooley

_Attention_ she interrupted under her breath and stepping forward
quickly touched the bell I have brought a frien of our dear droll
Cooley with me to tea Monsieur Mellin you mus make acquaintance with
Monsieur Sneyd He is English but we shall forgive him because he is a
such ole frien of mine

Ah yes said Mellin Remember seeing you on the boat running across
the pond

Yes ev coss responded Mr Sneyd cordially I wawsnt so fawchnit
as to meet you but dyuh eold Cooleys talked ev you often Heop I shll
see maw of you hyuh

A very trim very intelligentlooking maid opened the door and the
two men followed Madame de Vaurigard into a square hall hung with
tapestries and lit by two candles of a Brobdingnagian species Mellin had
heretofore seen only in cathedrals Here Mr Sneyd paused


I weont be bawthring you he said Just a wad with you Cantess and
Im off

The intelligentlooking maid drew back some heavy curtains leading to a
salon beyond the hall and her mistress smiled brightly at Mellin

I shall keep him to jus his one word she said as the young man
passed between the curtains

It was a nobly proportioned room that he entered so large that in
spite of the amount of old furniture it contained the first impression
it gave was one of spaciousness Panels of carved and blackened wood
lined the walls higher than his head above them Spanish leather
gleamed here and there with flickerings of red and gilt reflecting
dimly a small but brisk wood fire which crackled in a carved stone
fireplace His feet slipped on the floor of polished tiles and wandered
from silky rugs to lose themselves in great black bear skins as in
unmown sward He went from the portrait of a cinquecento cardinal to
a splendid tryptich set over a Gothic chest from a cabinet sheltering
a collection of old glass to an Annunciation by an unknown Primitive
He told himself that this was a room in a book and became dreamily
assured that he was a man in a book Finally he stumbled upon something
almost grotesquely out of place a large new perfectlyappointed
cardtable with a sliding top a smooth thick green cover and patent
compartments

He halted before this incongruity regarding it with astonishment
Then a light laugh rippled behind him and he turned to find Madame de
Vaurigard seated in a big red Venetian chair by the fire

She wore a black lace dress almost severe in fashion which gracefully
emphasized her slenderness and she sat with her knees crossed the
firelight twinkling on the beads of her slipper on her silken instep
and flashing again from the rings upon the slender fingers she had
clasped about her knee

She had lit a thin long Russian cigarette

You see she laughed I mus keep up with the time I mus do
somesing to hold my friens about me Even the ladies like to play
nowthat breedge wich is so tiresomethey play play play And
youyou Americans you refuse to endure us if we do not let you play
So for my friens when they come to my houseif they wish it there
is that foolish little table I fearshe concluded with a bewitching
affectation of sadnessthey prefer that to talkin wiz me

You know that couldnt be so _Comtesse_ he said I would rather
talk to you thanthan

Ah yes you say so Monsieur She looked at him gravely a little
sigh seemed to breathe upon her lips she leaned forward nearer the
fire her face wistful in the thin rosy light and it seemed to him he
had never seen anything so beautiful in his life

He came across to her and sat upon a stool at her feet On my soul he
began huskily I swear

She laid her finger on her lips shaking her head gently and he was
silent while the intelligent maidat that moment enteringarranged a
teatable and departed

American an Russian they are the worse said the Countess
thoughtfully as she served him with a generous cup laced with rum
but the American he is the bes to play _wiz_ Mellin found her
irresistible when she said wiz

Why is that

Oh the Russian play high yesbut the Americanshe laughed
delightedly and stretched her arms widehe make it all a joke He is
beeg like his beeg country If he win or lose he don care Ah I mus
tell you of my great American frien that Honorable Chanlair Pedlow
who is comin to Rome You have heard of Honorable Chanlair Pedlow in
America

I remember hearing that name

Ah I shall make you know him He is a man of distinction he did sit
in your Chamber of Deputieswhat you call ityes your Congress He
is funny eccentricalways he roar like a lionBoumbut so simple
so good a man of such fine heartso lovable

Ill be glad to meet him said Mellin coldly

An oh yes I almos forget to tell you she went on your frien
that dear Cooley he is on his way from Monte Carlo in his automobile I
have a note from him today

Good sort of fellow little Cooley in his way remarked her companion
graciously Not especially intellectual or that you know His father
was a manufacturer chap I believe or something of the sort I suppose
you saw a lot of him in Paris

Eh I thought he is dead cried Madame de Vaurigard

The father is I mean little Cooley

Oh yes she laughed softly We had some gay times a little party
of us We shall be happy here too you will see I mus make a little
dinner very soon but not unless you will come You will

Do you want me very much

He placed his empty cup on the table and leaned closer to her smiling
She did not smile in response instead her eyes fell and there was the
faintest pathetic quiver of her lower lip

Already you know that she said in a low voice

She rose quickly turned away from him and walked across the room to the
curtains which opened upon the hall One of these she drew back

My frien you mus go now she said in the same low voice Tomorrow
I will see you again Come at four an you shall drive with mebut
notnot more_now_ Please

She stood waiting not looking at him but with head bent and eyes
veiled As he came near she put out a limp hand He held it for a few
seconds of distinctly emotional silence then strode swiftly into the
hall

She immediately let the curtain fall behind him and as he got his
hat and coat he heard her catch her breath sharply with a sound like a
little sob

Dazed with glory he returned to the hotel In the lobby he approached
the glittering concierge and said firmly

What is the Salone Margherita Cam you get me a box there tonight





IV Good Fellowship

He confessed his wickedness to Madame de Vaurigard the next afternoon
as they drove out the Appian Way A fellow must have just a bit of
a fling you know he said and really Salone Margherita isnt so
tremendously wicked

She shook her head at him in friendly raillery Ah that may be
but how many of those little dancinggirl have you invite to supper
afterward

This was a delicious accusation and though he shook his head in
virtuous denial he was before long almost convinced that he _had_ given
a rather dashing supper after the vaudeville and had _not_ gone quietly
back to the hotel only stopping by the way to purchase an orange and a
pocketful of horsechestnuts to eat in his room

It was a happy drive for Robert Russ Mellin though not happier than
that of the next day Three afternoons they spent driving over the
Campagna then back to Madame de Vaurigards apartment for tea by the
firelight till the enraptured American began to feel that the dream in
which he had come to live must of happy necessity last forever

On the fourth afternoon as he stepped out of the hotel elevator into
the corridor he encountered Mr Sneyd

Just stottin eh said the Englishman taking an envelope from his
pocket Lucky I caught you This is for you I just saw the Cantess
and she teold me to give it you Herry and read it and kem on t the
Amairikin Baw Chap I want you to meet Eold Cooleys thyah too Gawt in
with his tourincaw at noon

 You will forgive dear friend wrote Madame de Vaurigard
 if I ask you that we renounce our drive today You see I
 wish to have that little dinner tonight and must make
 preparation Honorable Chandler Pedlow arrived this morning
 from Paris and that droll Mr Cooley I have learn is
 coincidentally arrived also You see I think it would be
 very pleasant to have the dinner to welcome these friends on
 their arrival You will come surelyor I shall be so truly
 miserable You know it perhaps too well We shall have a
 happy evening if you come to console us for renouncing our
 drive A thousand of my prettiest wishes for you

 Helene


The signature alone consoled him To have that note from her to own it
was like having one of her gloves or her fan He would keep it forever
he thought indeed he more than half expressed a sentiment to that
effect in the response which he wrote in the aquarium while Sneyd
waited for him at a table near by The Englishman drew certain
conclusions in regard to this reply since it permitted a waiting
friend to consume three long tumblers of brandyandsoda before it was
finished However Mr Sneyd kept his reflections to himself and when
the epistle had been dispatched by a messenger took the Americans
arm and led him to the American Bar of the hotel a region hitherto
unexplored by Mellin

Leaning against the bar were Cooley and the man whom Mellin had seen
lolling beside Madame de Vaurigard in Cooleys automobile in Paris
the same gross person for whom he had instantly conceived a strong
repugnance a feeling not at once altered by a closer view

Cooley greeted Mellin uproariously and Mr Sneyd introduced the fat man
Mr Mellin the Honorable Chandler Pedlow he said nor was the shock
to the firstnamed gentleman lessened by young Cooleys adding Best
feller in the world

Mr Pedlows eyes were sheltered so deeply beneath florid rolls of flesh
that all one saw of them was an inscrutable gleam of blue but small
though they were they were not shifty for they met Mellins with a
squareness that was almost brutal He offered a fat paw wet by a full
glass which he set down too suddenly on the bar

Shake he said in a loud and husky voice and be friends Tommy he
added to the attendant another round of Martinis

Not for me said Mellin hastily I dont often

_What_ Mr Pedlow roared suddenly Why the first words Countess de
Vaurigard says to me this afternoon was I want you to meet my young
friend Mellin she says the gamest little Indian that ever come down
the pike Hes game she sayshell see you _all_ under the table
Thats what the smartest little woman in the world the Countess de
Vaurigard says about you

This did not seem very closely to echo Madame de Vaurigards habit of
phrasing but Mellin perceived that it might be only the fat mans way
of putting things

You aint goin back on _her_ are you continued Mr Pedlow You
aint goin to make her out a liar I tell you when the Countess de
Vaurigard says a man s game he is game He laid his big paw cordially
on Mellins shoulder and smiled lowering his voice to a friendly
whisper And Ill bet ten thousand dollars right out of my pants pocket
you _are_ game too

He pressed a glass into the others hand Smiling feebly the
embarrassed Mellin accepted it

Make it four more Tommy said Pedlow And here continued
this thoughtful man I dont go bandying no ladies names around a
barroomthat aint my stylebut I do want to propose a toast I wont
name her but you all know who I mean

Sure we do interjected Cooley warmly Queen Thats what she is

Heres _to_ her continued Mr Pedlow Heres to herbrightest and
bestand no heeltaps And now lets set down over in the corner and
take it easy It aint hardly five oclock yet and we can set here
comfortable gittin ready for dinner until halfpast six anyway

Whereupon the four seated themselves about a tabouret in the corner
and a waiter immediately bringing them four fresh glasses from the bar
Mellin began to understand what Mr Pedlow meant by gittin ready for
dinner The burden of the conversation was carried almost entirely
by the Honorable Chandler though Cooley whose boyish face was deeply
flushed now and then managed to interrupt by talking louder than the
fat man Mr Sneyd sat silent

Good ole Sneyd said Pedlow _He_ never talks jest saws wood Only
Britisher I ever liked Plays cards like a goat

He played a mighty good game on the steamer said Cooley warmly

I dont care what he did on the steamer he played like a goat the
only time _I_ ever played with him You know he did I reckon you was
_there_

Should say I _was_ there He played mighty well

Like a goat reiterated the fat man firmly

Nothing of the sort You had a run of hands that was all Nobody can
go against the kind of luck you had that night and you took it away
from Sneyd and me in rolls But well land you pretty soon wont we
ole Sneydie

We shll have a shawt at him at least said the Englishman

Perhaps he wont want us to try young Cooley pursued derisively
Perhaps he thinks I play like a goat too

Mr Pedlow threw back his head and roared Give me somepn easy You
dont know no more how to play a hand of cards than a giraffe does Ill
throw in all of my Blue Gulch goldstockand its worth eight hundred
thousand dollars if its worth a centIll put it up against that tin
automobile of yours divide chips even and play you freezeout for it
You play cards Go learn hopscotch

You wait exclaimed the other indignantly Next time we play well
make you look so small youll think youre back in Congress

At this Mr Pedlow again threw back his head and roared his vast body
so shaken with mirth that the glass he held in his hand dropped to the
floor

There said Cooley thats the second Martini youve spilled Youre
two behind the rest of us

What of it bellowed the fat man Theres plenty comin aint there
Four more Tommy and bring cigars Dont take a cent from none of these
Indians Gentlemen your money aint good here I own this bar and this
is my night

Mellin had begun to feel at ease and after a timeas they continued to
sithe realized that his repugnance to Mr Pedlow was wearing off he
felt that there must be good in any one whom Madame de Vaurigard liked
She had spoken of Pedlow often on their drives he was an eccentric
she said an original Why not accept her verdict Besides Pedlow
was a man of distinction and force he had been in Congress he was a
millionaire and as became evident in the course of a long recital of
the principal events of his career most of the great men of the time
were his friends and proteges

Well Mack says I one day when we were in the House togetherthus
Mr Pedlow alluding to the late President McKinleyMack says I
if youd drop that double standard businesshe was waverin toward
silver along thenI dont know but I might git the boys to nominate
you fer President Ill think it over he saysIll think it over
You remember me tellin you about that at the time dont you Sneyd
when you was in the British Legation at Washinton

Pahfictly said Mr Sneyd lighting a cigar with great calmness

Yes I says Mack I says if youll drop it Ill turn in and git
you the nomination

Did he drop it asked Mellin innocently

Mr Pedlow leaned forward and struck the young mans knee a resounding
blow with the palm of his hand

He was _nominated_ wasnt he

Time to dress announced Mr Sneyd looking at his watch

One more round first insisted Cooley with prompt vehemence Lets
finish with our first toast again Cant drink that too often

This proposition was received with warmest approval and they drank
standing Brightest and best shouted Mr Pedlow

Queen What she is exclaimed Cooley

_Ma belle Marquise_ whispered Mellin tenderly as the rim touched his
lips

A small keenfaced man whose steady gray eyes were shielded by
tortoiserimmed spectacles had come into the room and now stood quietly
at the bar sipping a glass of Vichy He was sharply observant of the
party as it broke up Pedlow and Sneyd preceding the younger men to
the corridor and as the latter turned to follow the stranger stepped
quickly forward speaking Cooleys name

Whats the matter

Perhaps you dont remember me My names Cornish Im a newspaper man
a correspondent He named a New York paper Im down here to get
a Vatican story I knew your father for a number of years before his
death and I think I may claim that he was a friend of mine

Thats good said the youth cordially If I hadnt a fine start
already and wasnt in a hurry to dress wed have another

You were pointed out to me in Paris continued Cornish I found
where you were staying and called on you the next day but you had just
started for the Riviera He hesitated glancing at Mellin Can you
give me half a dozen words with you in private

Youll have to excuse me Im afraid Ive only got about ten minutes
to dress See you tomorrow

I should like it to be as soon as possible the journalist said
seriously It isnt on my own account and I

All right You come to my room at ten tmorrow morning

Well if you cant possibly make it tonight said Cornish
reluctantly I wish

Cant possibly

And Cooley taking Mellin by the arm walked rapidly down the corridor
Funny ole correspondent he murmured What do _I_ know about the
Vatican




V Lady Mount Rhyswicke

The four friends of Madame de Vaurigard were borne to her apartment from
the Magnifique in Cooleys big car They sailed triumphantly down and up
the hills in a cool and bracing air under a moon that shone as brightly
for them as it had for Caesar and Mellins soul was buoyant within him
He thought of Cranston and laughed aloud What would Cranston say if it
could see him in a sixtyhorse touringcar with two millionaires and an
English diplomat brother of an earl and all on the way to dine with a
countess If Mary Kramer could see him Poor Mary Kramer Poor little
Mary Kramer

A manservant took their coats in Madame de Vaurigards hall where
they could hear through the curtains the sound of one or two voices in
cheerful conversation

Sneyd held up his hand

Listen he said Shawly that isnt Lady MountRhyswickes voice She
couldnt be in Reomalways a Rhyswicke Cawsl for Decembah By Jev it
is

Nothin of the kind said Pedlow I know Lady MountRhyswicke as well
as I know you I started her father in business when he was clerkin
behind a counter in Liverpool I give him the money to begin on Make
good says I thats all Make good And he done it too Educated
his daughter fit fer a princess married her to MountRhyswicke and
when he died left her ten million dollars if he left her a cent I know
Madge MountRhyswicke and that aint her voice

A peal of silvery laughter rang from the other side of the curtain

Theyve heard you said Cooley

An who could help it Madame de Vaurigard herself threw back the
curtains Who could help hear our great dear ole lion How he roar

She wore a white velvet princesse gown of a fashion which was a shade
less than what is called daring with a rope of pearls falling from
her neck and a diamond star in her dark hair Standing with one arm
uplifted to the curtains and with the mellow glow of candles and
firelight behind her she was so lovely that both Mellin and Cooley
stood breathlessly still until she changed her attitude This she did
only to move toward them extending a hand to each letting Cooley seize
the right and Mellin the left

Each of them was pleased with what he got particularly Mellin The
left is nearer the heart he thought

She led them through the curtains not withdrawing her hands until they
entered the salon She might have led them out of her fifthstory window
in that fashion had she chosen

My two wicked boys she laughed tenderly This also pleased both of
them though each would have preferred to be her only wicked boya
preference which perhaps had something to do with the later events of
the evening

Aha I know you both before twenty minute you will be makin love to
Lady MountRhyswicke Behol those two already An they are only ole
friens

She pointed to Pedlow and Sneyd The fat man was shouting at a woman in
pink satin who lounged halfreclining among a pile of cushions upon a
divan near the fire Sneyd gallantly bending over her to kiss her hand

It is a very little dinner you see continued the hostess only
seven but we shall be seven time happier

The seventh person proved to be the Italian Corni who had surrendered
his seat in Madame de Vaurigards victoria to Mellin on the Pincio He
presently made his appearance followed by a waiter bearing a tray of
glasses filled with a pink liquid while the Countess led her two wicked
boys across the room to present them to Lady MountRhyswicke Already
Mellin was forming sentences for his next letter to the Cranston
Telegraph Lady MountRhyswicke said to me the other evening
while discussing the foreign policy of Great Britain in Comtesse de
Vaurigards salon An English peeress of pronounced literary acumen
has been giving me rather confidentially her opinion of our American
poets

The inspiration of these promising fragments was a large wearylooking
person with no lack of powdered shoulder above her pink bodice and a
profusion of undulated hair of so decided a blond that it might have
been suspected that the decision had lain with the lady herself

Howjdo she said languidly when Mellins name was pronounced to her
Theres a man behind you tryin to give you something to drink

Who was it said these were Martinis snorted Pedlow Theyve got
perfumery in em

Ah what a bad lion it is Madame de Vaurigard lifted both hands in
mock horror Roar lion roar she cried An think of the emotion of
our good Cavaliere Corni who have come an hour early jus to make them
for us I ask Monsieur Mellin if it is not good

And Ill leave it to Cooley said Pedlow If he can drink all of his
Ill eat crow

Thus challenged the two young men smilingly accepted glasses from the
waiter and lifted them on high

Same toast said Cooley Queen

_A la belle Marquise_

Gallantly they drained the glasses at a gulp and Madame de Vaurigard
clapped her hands

Bravo she cried You see Corni and I we win

Look at their faces said Mr Pedlow tactlessly drawing attention to
what was for the moment an undeniably painful sight Dont tell me an
Italian knows how to make a good Martini

Mellin profoundly agreed but as he joined the small procession to the
Countess dinnertable he was certain that an Italian at least knew how
to make a strong one

The light in the diningroom was provided by six heavilyshaded candles
on the table the latter decorated with delicate lines of orchids The
chairs were large and comfortable covered with tapestry the glass was
old Venetian and the servants moving like useful ghosts in the shadow
outside the circle of mellow light were particularly efficient in the
matter of keeping the wineglasses full Madame de Vaurigard had put
Pedlow on her right Cooley on her left with Mellin directly opposite
her next to Lady MountRhyswicke Mellin was pleased because he
thought he would have the Countesss face toward him Anything would
have pleased him just then

This is the kind of table _everybody_ ought to have he observed to
the party in general as he finished his first glass of champagne Im
going to have it like this at my place in the Statesif I ever decide
to go back Ill have six separate candlesticks like this not a
candelabrum and that will be the only light in the room And Ill never
have anything but orchids on my table

For my part Lady MountRhyswicke interrupted in the loud tired
monotone which seemed to be her only manner of speaking I like more
light I like all the light thats goin

If Lady MountRhyswicke sat at _my_ table returned Mellin dashingly
I should wish all the light in the world to shine upon so happy an
event

Hear the man she drawled Hes proposing to me Thinks Im a widow

There was a chorus of laughter over which rose the bellow of Mr
Pedlow

Hes game she saysand _aint_ he

Across the table Madame de Vaurigards eyes met Mellins with a mocking
intelligence so complete that he caught her message without need of the
words she noiselessly formed with her lips I tol you you would be
making love to her

He laughed joyously in answer Why shouldnt he flirt with Lady
MountRhyswicke He was thoroughly happy his Helene his _belle
Marquise_ sat across the table from him sending messages to him with
her eyes He adored her but he liked Lady MountRhyswickehe liked
everybody and everything in the world He liked Pedlow particularly and
it no longer troubled him that the fat man should be a friend of Madame
de Vaurigard Pedlow was a character and a wit as well Mellin laughed
heartily at everything the Honorable Chandler Pedlow said

This is life remarked the young man to his fair neighbor

What is Sittin round a table eatin and drinkin

Ah lovely skeptic She looked at him strangely but he continued with
growing enthusiasm I mean to sit at such a table as this with such
a chef with such winesto know one crowded hour like this is to live
Not a thing is missing all this swagger furniture the rich atmosphere
of smartness about the whole place best of all the company Its a
great thing to have the _real_ people around you the right sort you
know socially people youd ask to your own table at home There are
only seven but every one _distingue_ every one

She leaned both elbows on the table with her hands palm to palm and
resting her cheek against the back of her left hand looked at him
steadily

And youare you distinguished too

Oh I wouldnt be much known over _here_ he said modestly

Do you write poetry

Oh not professionally though it is published I supposehe sipped
his champagne with his head a little to one side as though judging its
qualityI suppose I ve been more or less a dilettante Ive knocked
about the world a good bit

Helene says youre one of these leisure American billionaires like Mr
Cooley there she said in her tired voice

Oh none of us are really quite billionaires He laughed
deprecatingly

No I suppose notnot really Go on and tell me some more about life
and this distinguished company

Hey folks Mr Pedlows roar broke in upon this dialogue You two
are gittin mighty thick over there Were drinking a toast and youll
have to break away long enough to join in

Queen Thats what she is shouted Cooley

Mellin lifted his glass with the others and drank to Madame de
Vaurigard but the woman at his side did not change her attitude and
continued to sit with her elbows on the table her cheek on the back of
her hand watching him thoughtfully





VI Rakes Progress

Many toasts were uproariously honored the health of each member of the
party in turn then the country of each France and England first
out of courtesy to the ladies Italy next since this beautiful and
extraordinary meeting of distinguished people as Mellin remarked in a
short speech he felt called upon to make took place in that wonderful
land then the United States This last toast the gentlemen felt it
necessary to honor by standing in their chairs

_Song The StarSpangled Bannerwithout wordsby Mr Cooley and
chorus_

When the cigars were brought the ladies graciously remained adding
tiny spirals of smoke from their cigarettes to the layers of blue haze
which soon overhung the table Through this haze in the gentle light
which seemed to grow softer and softer Mellin saw the face of Helene
de Vaurigard luminous as an angels She _was_ an angeland the others
were gods What could be more appropriate in Rome Lady MountRhyswicke
was Juno but more beautiful For himself he felt like a god too
Olympic in serenity

He longed for mysterious dangers How debonair he would stroll among
them He wished to explore the unknown felt the need of a splendid
adventure and had a happy premonition that one was coming nearer and
nearer He favored himself with a hopeful vision of the apartment on
fire Robert Russ Mellin smiling negligently among the flames and Madame
de Vaurigard kneeling before him in adoration Immersed in delight he
puffed his cigar and let his eyes rest dreamily upon the face of Helene
He was quite undisturbed by an argument more a commotion than a debate
between Mr Pedlow and young Cooley It ended by their rising the
latter overturning a chair in his haste

I dont know the rudiments dont I cried the boy You wait Ole
Sneydie and Ill trim you down Corni says hell play too Come on
Mellin

I wont go unless Helene goes said Mellin What are you going to do
when you get there

Alas my frien exclaimed Madame de Vaurigard rising is it not
what I tol you Always you are never content wizout your play You come
to dinner an when it is finish you play play play

_Play_ He sprang to his feet Bravo Thats the very thing Ive been
wanting to do I knew there was something I wanted to do but I couldnt
think what it was

Lady MountRhyswicke followed the others into the salon but Madame de
Vaurigard waited just inside the doorway for Mellin

_High_ play he cried We must play high I wont play any other
wayI want to play _high_

Ah wicked one What did I tell you

He caught her hand And you must play too Helene

No no she laughed breathlessly

Then youll watch Promise youll watch me I wont let you go till you
promise to watch me

I shall adore it my frien

Mellin called Cooley from the other room You comin or not

Cant you see me answered Mellin hilariously entering with Madame de
Vaurigard who was rosy with laughter Peculiar thing to look at a man
and not see him

Candles were lit in many sconces on the walls and the cardtable had
been pushed to the centre of the room little towers of blue white
and scarlet counters arranged upon it in orderly rows like miniature
castles

Now then demanded Cooley are the ladies goin to play

Never cried Madame de Vaurigard

All right said the youth cheerfully you can look on Come and sit
by me for a mascot

Youll need a mascot my boy shouted Pedlow Thats right though
take her

He pushed a chair close to that in which Cooley had already seated
himself and Madame de Vaurigard dropped into it laughing Mellin
you set there he continued pushing the young man into a seat opposite
Cooley Well give both you young fellers a mascot He turned to Lady
MountRhyswicke who had gone to the settee by the fire Madge you
come and set by Mellin he commanded jovially Maybe hell forget you
aint a widow again

I dont believe I care much about bein anybodys mascot tonight she
answered There was a hint of anger in her tired monotone

What He turned from the table and walked over to the fireplace I
reckon I didnt understand you he said quietly almost gently You
better come hadnt you

She met his inscrutable little eyes steadily A faint redness slowly
revealed itself on her powdered cheeks then she followed him back to
the table and took the place he had assigned to her at Mellins elbow

Ill bank said Pedlow taking a chair between Cooley and the Italian
unless somebody wants to take it off my hands Now what are we
playing

Pokah responded Sneyd with mild sarcasm

Bravo cried Mellin Thats _my_ game Ber_ravo_

This was so far true it was the only game upon which he had ever
ventured money he had played several times when the wagers were allowed
to reach a limit of twentyfive cents

You know what I mean I reckon said Pedlow I mean what we are
playin _fer_

Twentyfive franc limit responded Cooley authoritatively Double for
jacks Play two hours and settle when we quit

Mellin leaned back in his chair You call that high he asked with a
sniff of contempt Why not double it

The fat man hammered the table with his fist delightedly Hes game
she says Hes the gamest little Indian ever come down the big road
she says Was she right What Maybe she wasnt Well double it before
very long my boy thisll do to start on There He distributed
some of the small towers of ivory counters and made a memorandum in a
notebook Theres four hundred apiece

That all inquired Mellin whereupon Mr Pedlow uproariously repeated
Madame de Vaurigards alleged tribute

As the game began the intelligentlooking maid appeared from the
diningroom bearing bottles of whisky and soda and these she deposited
upon small tables at the convenience of the players so that at the
conclusion of the first encounter in the gentle tournament there was
material for a toast to the gallant who had won it

Heres to the gamest Indian of us all proposed the fat man Did you
notice him call me with a pair of tens And me queenhigh

Mellin drained a deep glass in honor of himself On my soul Chan
Pedlow I think youre the bes fellow in the whole world he said
gratefully Only trouble with youyou dont want to play high enough

He won again and again adding other towers of counters to his original
allotment so that he had the semblance of a tiny castle When the cards
had been dealt for the fifth time he felt the light contact of a slipper
touching his foot under the table

That slipper he decided from the nature of things could belong to
none other than his Helene and even as he came to this conclusion the
slight pressure against his foot was gently but distinctly increased
thrice He pressed the slipper in return with his shoe at the same time
giving Madame de Vaurigard a look of grateful surprise and tenderness
which threw her into a confusion so evidently genuine that for an
unworthy moment he had a jealous suspicion she had meant the little
caress for some other

It was a disagreeable thought and in the hope of banishing it he
refilled his glass but his mood had begun to change It seemed to him
that Helene was watching Cooley a great deal too devotedly Why had she
consented to sit by Cooley when she had promised to watch Robert Russ
Mellin He observed the pair stealthily

Cooley consulted her in laughing whispers upon every discard upon every
bet Now and then in their whisperings Cooleys hair touched hers
sometimes she laid her hand on his the more conveniently to look at his
cards Mellin began to be enraged Did she think that puling milksop
had as much as a shadow of the daring the devilry the carelessness of
consequences which lay within Robert Russ Mellin Consequences What
were they There were no such things She would not look at himwell
he would make her Thenceforward he raised every bet by another to the
extent of the limit agreed upon

Mr Cooley was thoroughly happy He did not resemble Ulysses he would
never have had himself bound to the mast and there were already sounds
of unearthly sweetness in his ears His conferences with his lovely
hostess easily consoled him for his losses In addition he was
triumphing over the boaster for Mr Pedlow with a very ill grace
and swearing not under his breath was losing too The Countess
reiterating for the hundredth time that Cooley was a wicked one
sweetly constituted herself his cupbearer kept his glass full and
brought him fresh cigars

Mellin dealt her furious glances and filled his own glass for Lady
MountRhyswicke plainly had no conception of herself in the role of a
Hebe The hospitable Pedlow observing this neglect was moved to chide
her

Look at them two cooing doves over there he said reproachfully a
jerk of his bulbous thumb indicating Madame de Vaurigard and her young
protege Madge cant you do nothin fer our friend the Indian Cant
you even help him to sody

Oh perhaps she answered with the slightest flash from her tired
eyes Then she nonchalantly lifted Mellins replenished glass from the
table and drained it This amused Cooley

I like that he chuckled Thats one way of helpin a feller Helene
can you do any better than that

Ah this dear droll Cooley

The tantalizing witch lifted the youths glass to his lips and let
him drink as a mother helps a thirsty child _Bebe_ she laughed
endearingly

As the lovely Helene pronounced that word Lady MountRhyswicke was
leaning forward to replace Mellins empty glass upon the table

I dont care whether youre a widow or not he shouted furiously And
he resoundingly kissed her massive shoulder

There was a wild shout of laughter even the imperturbable Sneyd who
had continued to win steadily wiped tears from his eyes and Madame
de Vaurigard gave way to intermittent hysteria throughout the ensuing
halfhour

For a time Mellin sat grimly observing this inexplicable merriment with
a cold smile

Laugh on he commanded with bitter satire some ten minutes after play
had been resumedand was instantly obeyed

Whereupon his mood underwent another change and he became convinced
that the world was a warm and kindly place where it was good to live
He forgot that he was jealous of Cooley and angry with the Countess he
liked everybody again especially Lady MountRhyswicke Wont you
sit farther forward he begged her earnestly so that I can see your
beautiful golden hair

He heard but dimly the spasmodic uproar that followed Laugh on he
repeated with a swoop of his arm I dont care Dont you care either
Mrs MountRhyswicke Please sit where I can see your beautiful golden
hair Dont be afraid Ill kiss you again I wouldnt do it for the
whole world Youre one of the noblest women I ever knew I feel thats
true I dont know how I know it but I know it Let em laugh

After this everything grew more and more hazy to him For a time there
was in the centre of the haze a nimbus of light which revealed his
cards to him and the towers of chips which he constantly called for and
which as constantly disappearedlike the towers of a castle in Spain
Then the haze thickened and the one thing clear to him was a phrase
from an oldtime novel he had read long ago

Debt of honor

The three words appeared to be written in flames against a background of
dense fog A debt of honor was as promissory note which had to be
paid on Monday and the appeal to the obdurate grandfathera peer of
England the Earl of MountRhyswicke in factwas made at midnight
Sunday The fog grew still denser lifted for a moment while he wrote
his name many times on slips of blue paper closed down once more and
again liftedoutofdoors this timeto show him a lunatic ballet of
moons dancing streakily upon the horizon

He heard himself say quite clearly All right old man thank you
but dont bother about me to a pallid but humorous Cooley in evening
clothes the fog thickened oblivion closed upon him for a seeming
second




VII The Next Morning

Suddenly he sat up in bed in his room at the Magnifique gazing upon a
disconsolate Cooley in gray tweeds who sat heaped in a chair at the foot
of the bed with his head in his hands

Mellins first sensation was of utter mystification his second was more
corporeal the consciousness of physical misery of consuming fever of
aches that ran over his whole body converging to a dreadful climax in
his head of a throat so immoderately partched it seemed to crackle and
a thirst so avid it was a passion His eye fell upon a carafe of water
on a chair at his bedside he seized upon it with a shaking hand and
drank half its contents before he set it down The action attracted
his companions attention and he looked up showing a pale and haggard
countenance

How do you feel inquired Cooley with a wan smile

Mellins head dropped back upon the pillow and he made one or two
painful efforts to speak before he succeeded in finding a ghastly
semblance of his voice

I thought I was at Madame de Vaurigards

You were said the other adding grimly We both were

But that was only a minute ago

It was six hours ago Its goin on ten oclock in the morning

I dont understand how that can be How did I get here

I brought you I was pretty bad but youI never saw anything like
you From the time you kissed Lady MountRhyswicke

Mellin sat bolt upright in bed staring wildly He began to tremble
violently

Dont you remember that asked Cooley

Suddenly he did The memory of it came with inexorable clarity he
crossed forearms over his horrorstricken face and fell back upon his
pillow

Oh he gasped Unspeakable Unspeakable

Lord Dont worry about that I dont think she minded

Its the thought of Madame de Vaurigardit kills me The horror of
itthat I should do such a thing in her house Shell never speak to
me again she oughtnt to she ought to send her groom to beat me You
cant think what Ive lost

Cant I Mr Cooley rose from his chair and began to pace up and down
the chamber I can guess to within a thousand francs of what _I_ve
lost I had to get the hotel to cash a check on New York for me this
morning Ive a habit of carrying all my money in bills and a fool
trick too Well Im cured of it

Oh if it were only a little _money_ and nothing else that Id lost
The money means nothing Mellin choked

I suppose youre pretty well fixed Well so am I Cooley shook his
head but money certainly means something to me

It wouldnt if youd thrown away the most precious friendship of your
life

See here said Cooley halting at the foot of the bed and looking at
his stricken companion from beneath frowning brows I guess I can see
how it is with you and Ill tell you frankly its been the same with
me I never met such a fascinating woman in my life she throws a
regler olefashioned _spell_ over you Now I hate to say it but I
cant help it because it plain hits me in the face every time I think
of it the truth iswell sir Im afraid you and me have had little
red soldiercoats and caps put on us and strings tied to our belts while
we turned somersets for the children

I dont understand I dont know what youre talking about

No It seems to get more and more simple to me Ive been thinking it
all over and over again I cant _help_ it See here I met Sneyd on the
steamer without any introduction He sort of warmed into the game in
the smokingroom and he won straight along the trip He called on me in
London and took me to meet the Countess at her hotel We three went
to the theatre and lunch and so forth a few times and when I left for
Paris she turned up on the way thats when you met her Couple of days
later Sneyd came over and he and the Countess introduced me to dear
ole friend Pedlow So you see I dont rightly even know who any of em
really _are_ just took em for granted as it were We had lots of fun
I admit that honkin about in my car We only played cards once and
that was in her apartment the last night before I left Paris but that
one time Pedlow won fifteen thousand francs from me When I told them my
plans how I was goin to motor down to Rome she said _she_ would be in
Romeand I tell you I was happy as a poodlepup about it Sneyd said
he might be in Rome along about then and openhearted ole Pedlow said
not to be surprised if _he_ turned up too Well he did almost to the
minute and in the meantime shed got _you_ hooked on fine and tight

I dont understand you Mellin lifted himself painfully on an elbow
I dont know what youre getting at but it seems to me that youre
speaking disrespectfully of an angel that Ive insulted and I

Now see here Mellin Ill tell you something The boys white face
showed sudden color and there was a catch in his voice I wasIve
been mighty near in _love_ with that woman But Ive had a kind of a
shock Ive got my commonsense back and Im _not_ any more I dont
know exactly how much money I had but it was between thirtyfive and
thirtyeight thousand francs and Sneyd won it all after we took off the
limitover seven thousand dollarsat her table last night Putting two
and two together honestly it looks bad It looks _mighty_ bad Now Im
pretty well fixed and yesterday I didnt care whether school kept or
not but seven thousand dollars is real money to anybody My old man
worked pretty hard for his first seven thousand I guess andhe
gulpedhed think a lot of me for lettin go of it the way I did last
night _wouldnt_ he You never _see_ things like this till the next
morning And you remember that other woman sat where she could see every
hand _you_ drew and the Countess

Stop Mellin flung one arm up violently striking the headboard with
his knuckles I wont hear a syllable against Madame de Vaurigard
Young Cooley regarded him steadily for a moment Have you remembered
yet he said slowly how much _you_ lost last night

I only remember that I behaved like an unspeakable boor in the presence
of the divinest creature that ever

Cooley disregarded the outburst and said

When we settled you had a pad of express company checks worth six
hundred dollars You signed all of em and turned em over to Sneyd with
three onehundredlire bills which was all the cash you had with you
Then you gave him your note for twelve thousand francs to be paid within
three days You made a great deal of fuss about its being a debt of
honor He paused You hadnt remembered that had you

Mellin had closed his eyes He lay quite still and made no answer

No Ill bet you hadnt said Cooley correctly deducing the fact
Youre well off or you wouldnt be at this hotel and for all I know
you may be fixed so you wont mind your loss as much as I do mine but
it ought to make you kind of charitable toward my suspicions of Madame
de Vaurigards friends

The six hundred dollars in express company checks and the three
hundredlire bills were all the money the unhappy Mellin had in the
world and until he could return to Cranston and go back to work in the
realestate office again he had no prospect of any more He had not
even his steamer ticket In the shock of horror and despair he whispered
brokenly

I dont care if they re the worst people in the world theyre better
than I am

The others gloom cleared a little at this Well you _have_ got it
he exclaimed briskly You dont know how different youll feel after a
long walk in the open air He looked at his watch Ive got to go and
see what that newspaperman Cornish wants its ten oclock Ill be
back after a while I want to reason this out with you I dont deny but
its possible Im wrong anyway you think it over while Im gone You
take a good hard think will you

As he closed the door Mellin slowly drew the coverlet over his head It
was as if he covered the face of some one who had just died




VIII What Cornish Knew


Two hours passed before young Cooley returned He knocked twice without
a reply then he came in

The coverlet was still over Mellins head

Asleep asked Cooley

No

The coverlet was removed by a shaking hand

Murder exclaimed Cooley sympathetically at sight of the others
face A night off certainly does things to you Better let me get you
some

No Ill be all rightafter while

Then Ill go right ahead with our little troubles Ive decided to
leave for Paris by the onethirty and havent got a whole lot of time
Cornish is here with me in the hall hes got something to say thats
important for you to hear and Im goin to bring him right in He
waved his hand toward the door which he had left open Come along
Cornish Poor ole Mellinll play Du Barry with us and give us a morning
leevy while he listens in a bed with a palanquin to it Now lets draw
up chairs and be sociable

The journalist came in smoking a long cigar and took the chair the
youth pushed toward him but after a twinkling glance through his big
spectacles at the face on the pillow he rose and threw the cigar out of
the window

Go ahead said Cooley I want you to tell him just what you told me
and when youre through I want to see if he doesnt think Im Sherlock
Holmes little brother

If Mr Mellin does not feel too ill said Cornish dryly I know how
painful such cases sometimes

No Mellin moistened his parched lips and made a pitiful effort to
smile Ill be all right very soon

I am very sorry began the journalist that I wasnt able to get a
few words with Mr Cooley yesterday evening Perhaps you noticed that I
tried as hard as I could without using actual forcehe laughedto
detain him

You did your best agreed Cooley ruefully and I did my worst Nobody
ever listens till the next day

Well Im glad no vital damage was done anyway said Cornish It
would have been pretty hard lines if you two young fellows had been
poor men but as it is youre probably none the worse for a lesson like
this

You seem to think seven thousand dollars is a joke remarked Cooley

Cornish laughed again You see it flatters me to think my time was
so valuable that a ten minutes talk with me would have saved so much
money

I doubt it said Cooley Ten to one wed neither of us have believed
youlast night

I doubt it too Cornish turned to Mellin I hear that you Mr
Mellin are still of the opinion that you were dealing with straight
people

Mellin managed to whisper Yes

Then said Cornish Id better tell you just what I know about it
and you can form your own opinion as to whether I do know or not I have
been in the newspaper business on this side for fifteen years and my
headquarters are in Paris where these people are very well known The
man who calls himself Chandler Pedlow was a farodealer for Tom Stout
in Chicago when Stouts place was broken up a good many years ago
There was a real Chandler Pedlow in Congress from a California district
in the early nineties but he is dead This mans name is Ben Welch
hes a professional swindler and the Englishman Sneyd is another a
quiet man not so well known as Welch and not nearly so clever but a
good feeder for him The very attractive Frenchwoman who calls herself
Comtesse de Vaurigard is generally believed to be Sneyds wife though
I could not take the stand on that myself Welch is the brains of the
organization you mightnt think it but hes a very brilliant
manhe might have made a great reputation in business if hed been
straightand with this womans help hes carried out some really
astonishing schemes His manner is clumsy _he_ knows that bless you
but its the only manner he can manage and she is so adroit she can
sugarcoat even such a pill as that and coax people to swallow it I
dont know anything about the Italian who is working with them down
here But a gang of the WelchVaurigardSneyd type has tentacles all
over the Continent such people are in touch with sharpers everywhere
you see

Yes Cooley interpolated and with woolly little lambkins too

Well chuckled Cornish thats the way they make their living you
know

Go on and tell him the rest of it urged Cooley

About Lady MountRhyswicke said Cornish it seems strange enough
but she has a perfect right to her name She is a good deal older than
she looks and Ive heard she used to be remarkably beautiful Her third
husband was Lord George MountRhyswicke a man whod been dropped from
his clubs and he deserted her in 1903 but she has not divorced him It
is said that he is somewhere in South America however as to that I do
not know

Mr Cornish put the very slightest possible emphasis on the word know
and proceeded

Ive heard that she is sincerely attached to him and sends him money
from time to time when she has itthough that too is thirdhand
information She has been _declasse_ ever since her first divorce That
was a celebrated case and shes dropped down pretty far in the world
though I judge shes a good deal the best of this crowd Exactly what
her relations to the others are I dont know but I imagine that shes
pretty thick with em

Just a little exclaimed Cooley She sits behind one of the lambkins
and Helene behind the other while they get their woolly wool clipped I
suppose the two of em signaled what was in every hand we held though
Im sure they neednt have gone to the trouble Fact is I dont see why
they bothered about goin through the form of playin cards with us
at all They could have taken it away without that Whee Mr Cooley
whistled loud and long And theres loads of wise young men on the
ocean now hurryin over to take our places in the pens Well they can
have _mine_ Funny Mellin nobody would come up to you or me in the
Grand Central in New York and try to sell us greenbacks just as good
as real But we come over to Europe with our pockets full o money and
start in to see the Big City with Jesse James in a false mustache on one
arm and Lucresha Borgy under an assumed name on the other

I am afraid I agree with you said Cornish though I must say that
from all I hear Madame de Vaurigard might put an atmosphere about a
thing which would deceive almost any one who wasnt on his guard When a
Parisienne of her sort is clever at all shes irresistible

I believe you Cooley sighed deeply

Yesterday evening Mr Mellin continued the journalist when I saw
the son of my old friend in company with Welch and Sneyd of course I
tried to warn him Ive often seen them in Paris though I believe they
have no knowledge of me As Ive said they are notorious especially
Welch yet they have managed so far to avoid any difficulty with the
Paris police and Im sorry to say it might be hard to actually prove
anything against them You couldnt _prove_ that anything was crooked
last night for instance For that matter I dont suppose you want to
Mr Cooley wishes to accept his loss and bear it and I take it that
that will be your attitude too In regard to the note you gave Sneyd
I hope you will refuse to pay I dont think that they would dare press
the matter

Neither do I Mr Cooley agreed I left a silver cigarettecase at
the apartment last night and after talkin to Cornish a while ago I
sent my man for it with a note to her thatll make em all sit up and
take some notice The gangs all there together you can be sure I
asked for Sneyd and Pedlow in the office and found theyd gone out early
this morning leavin word they wouldnt be back till midnight And see
here I know Im easy but somehow I believe youre even a softer piece
o meat than I am I want you to promise me that whatever happens you
wont pay that I O U

Mellin moistened his lips in vain He could not answer

I want you to promise me not to pay it repeated Cooley earnestly

I promise gasped Mellin

You wont pay it no matter what they do

No

This seemed to reassure Mr Cooley

Well he said Ive got to hustle to get my car shipped and make the
train Cornish has finished his job down here and hes goin with me I
want to get out The whole things left a mighty bad taste in my mouth
and Id go crazy if I didnt get away from it Why dont you jump into
your clothes and come along too

I cant

Well said the young man with a sympathetic shake of the head you
certainly look sick It may be better if you stay in bed till evening
a trains a mighty mean place for the day after But I wouldnt hang
around here too long If you want money all you have to do is to ask
the hotel to cash a check on your home bank theyre always glad to
do that for Americans He turned to the door Mr Cornish if youre
goin to help me about shipping the car Im ready

So am I Goodby Mr Mellin

Goodby Mellin said feeblyand thank you

Young Cooley came back to the bedside and shook the others feverish
hand Goodby ole man Im awful sorry its all happened but Im glad
it didnt cost you quite as much money as it did me Otherwise I expect
its hit us about equally hard I wishI wish I could find a _nice
one_the youth gulped over something not unlike a sobas fascinatin
as her

Most people have had dreams of approaching dangers in the path of which
their bodies remained inert when in spite of the frantic wish to fly
it was impossible to move while all the time the horror crept closer
and closer This was Mellins state as he saw the young man going It
was absolutely necessary to ask Cooley for help to beg him for a loan
But he could not

He saw Cooleys hand on the doorknob saw the door swing open

Goodby again Cooley said and good luck to you

Mellins will strove desperately with the shame that held him silent

The door was closing

Oh Cooley called Mellin hoarsely

Yes What

Jjjust goodby said Mellin

And with that young Cooley was gone





IX Expiation

A multitudinous clangor of bells and a dozen neighboring chimes rang
noon then the rectangular oblongs of hot sunlight that fell from the
windows upon the carpet of Mellins room began imperceptibly to shift
their angles and move eastward From the stone pavement of the street
below came the sound of horses pawing and the voices of waiting cabmen
then bells again and more bells clamoring the slow and cruel afternoon
into the past But all was silent in Mellins room save when from time
to time a long shuddering sigh came from the bed

The unhappy young man had again drawn the coverlet over his head but
not to sleep it was more like a forlorn and desperate effort to hide
as if he crept into a hole seeking darkness to cover the shame and fear
that racked his soul For though his shame had been too great to let him
confess to young Cooley and ask for help his fear was as great as
his shame and it increased as the hours passed In truth his case was
desperate Except the people who had stripped him Cooley was the
only person in all of Europe with whom he had more than a very casual
acquaintance At home in Cranston he had no friends susceptible
to such an appeal as it was vitally necessary for him to make His
relatives were not numerous there were two aunts the widows of his
fathers brothers and a number of oldmaid cousins and he had an uncle
in Iowa a country minister whom he had not seen for years But he could
not cable to any of these for money nor could he quite conjure his
imagination into picturing any of them sending it if he did And even to
cable he would have to pawn his watch which was an oldfashioned one of
silver and might not bring enough to pay the charges

He began to be haunted by fragmentary prophetic visionsconfused but
realistic in detail and horridly probableof his ejectment from the
hotel perhaps arrest and trial He wondered what they did in Italy to
people who beat hotels and remembering what some one had told him
of the dreadfulness of Italian jails convulsive shudderings seized upon
him

The ruddy oblongs of sunlight crawled nearer to the east wall of the
room stretching themselves thinner and thinner until finally they
were not there at all and the room was left in deepening grayness
Carriages one after the other in unintermittent succession rumbled
up to the hotelentrance beneath the window bringing goldfish for
the Pincio and the fountains of Villa Borghese Wild strains from the
Hungarian orchestra rhapsodical twankings of violins and the runaway
arpeggios of a zither crazed with speedmania skipped along the
corridors and lightly through Mellins door In his minds eye he saw
the gay crowd in the watery light the little tables where only
five days ago he had sat with the loveliest of all the anemonelike
ladies

The beautifullydressed teadrinkers were there now under the green
glass dome prattling and smiling those people he had called his own
And as the music sounded louder faster wilder and wilder with the
gipsy madnessthen in that darkening bedchamber his soul became
articulate in a cry of humiliation

God in His mercy forgive me how raw I was


A vision came before his closed eyes the maplebordered street in
Cranston the long straight wide street where Mary Kramer lived a
summer twilight Mary in her white muslin dress on the veranda steps
and a wistaria vine climbing the post beside her halfembowering her
How cool and sweet and good she looked How dearand how _kind_she
had always been to him


Dusk stole through the windows the music ceased and the teahour was
over The carriages were departing bearing the gay people who went
away laughing calling last words to one another and naturally quite
unaware that a young man who five days before had adopted them and
called them his own was lying in a darkened room above them and
crying like a child upon his pillow





X The Cab at the Corner

A ten oclock a page bearing a card upon a silver tray knocked upon the
door and stared with wideeyed astonishment at the disordered gentleman
who opened it

The card was Lady MountRhyswickes Underneath the name was written

If you are there will you give me a few minutes I am waiting in a cab
at the next corner by the fountain

Mellins hand shook as he read He did not doubt that she came as an
emissary probably they meant to hound him for payment of the note
he had given Sneyd and at that thought he could have shrieked with
hysterical laughter

Do you speak English he asked

Spik little Yes

Who gave you this card

Coachman said the boy He wait risposta

Tell him to say that I shall be there in five minutes

Fi minute Yes Goodby

Mellin was partly dressedhe had risen half an hour earlier and
had been distractedly pacing the floor when the page knockedand he
completed his toilet quickly He passed down the corridors descended by
the stairway feeling that to use the elevator would be another abuse of
the confidence of the hotel company and slunk across the lobby with the
look and the sensations of a tramp who knows that he will be kicked into
the street if anybody catches sight of him

A closed cab stood near the fountain at the next corner There was a
trunk on the box by the driver and the roof was piled with bags and
rugs He approached uncertainly

Isis thisis it Lady MountRhyswicke he stammered pitifully

She opened the door

Yes Will you get in Well just drive round the block if you dont
mind Ill bring you back here in ten minutes And when he had
tremulously complied _Avanti cocchiere_ she called to the driver
and the tired little cabhorse began to draw them slowly along the
deserted street

Lady MountRhyswicke maintained silence for a time while her companion
waited his heart pounding with dreadful apprehensions Finally she gave
a short hard laugh and said

I saw your face by the corner light Been havin a hard day of it

The fear of breaking down kept him from answering He gulped painfully
once or twice and turned his face away from her Light enough from a
streetlamp shone in for her to see

I was rather afraid youd refuse she said seriously Really I
wonder you were willin to come

I wasI was afraid not to He choked out the confession with the
recklessness of final despair

So she said with another short laugh Then she resumed her even
tired monotone Your little friend Cooleys note this morning gave us
all a rather fair notion as to what you must be thinkin of us He seems
to have found a sort of walkin WhosWhoontheContinent since last
night Pity for some people he didnt find it before I dont think Im
sympathetic with your little Cooley I guess as you Yankees say he
can stand it Buther voice suddenly became louderIm not in the
business of robbin babies and orphans no my dear friends nor of
helpin anybody else to rob them eitherHere you are

She thrust into his hand a small packet securely wrapped in paper and
fastened with rubber bands Theres your block of express checks for
six hundred dollars and your I O U to Sneyd with it Take better care of
it next time

He had been tremulous enough but at that his whole body began to shake
violently

_What_ he quavered

I say take better care of it next time she said dropping again into
her monotone I didnt have such an easy time gettin it back from them
as you might think Ive got rather a sore wrist in fact

She paused at an inarticulate sound from him

Oh thats soon mended she laughed drearily The truth is its been
a good thing for meyour turning up Theyre gettin in too deep water
for me Helene and her friends and Ive broken with the lot or theyve
broken with me whichever it is We couldnt hang together after the
fightin weve done today I had to do a lot of threatenin and things
Welch was ugly so I had to be ugly too Never mindshe checked an
uncertain effort of his to speakI saw what you were like soon as
we sat down at the table last nighthow new you were and all that It
needed only a glance to see that Helene had made a mistake about you
Shed got a notion you were a millionaire like the little Cooley but
I knew better from your talk Shes clever but shes French and she
cant get it out of her head that you could be an American and not a
millionaire Of course they _all_ knew better when you brought out
your express checks and talked like somebody in one of the oldtime
storybooks about debts of honor Even Helene understood then that
the express checks were all you had She laughed I didnt have any
trouble gettin the _note_ back

She paused again for a moment then resumed There isnt much use our
goin over it all but I want you to know one thing Your little friend
Cooley made it rather clear that he accused Helene and me of signalin
Well I didnt Perhaps thats the reason you didnt lose as much as he
did I cant say And one thing more all this isnt goin to do you any
harm Im not very keen about philosophy and religion and that but I
believe if youre let in for a lot of trouble and it only _half_ kills
you you can get some good of it

Do you think he stammereddo you think Im worth saving

She smiled faintly and said

Youve probably got a sweetheart in the States somewherea nice girl
a pretty young thing who goes to church and thinks youre a great man
perhaps Is it so

I am not worthy he began choked suddenly then finishedto breathe
the same air

Thats quite right Lady MountRhyswicke assured him Think what
youd think of her if shed got herself into the same sort of scrape by
doin the things youve been doin And remember _that_ if you ever feel
impatient with her or have any temptations to superiority in times to
come And yetfor the moment she spoke earnestlyyou go back to your
little girl but dont you tell her a word of this You couldnt
even tell her that meetin you has helped me because she wouldnt
understand

Nor do I I cant

Oh its simple I saw that if I was gettin down to where I was
robbin babies and orphans The cab halted Heres your corner I
told him only to go round the block and come back Goodby Im off for
Amalfi Its a good place to rest

He got out dazedly and the driver cracked his whip over the little
horse but Mellin lifted a detaining hand

_A spet_ called Lady MountRhyswicke to the driver What is it Mr
Mellin

I cantI cant look you in the face he stammered his attitude
perfectly corroborative of his words I wouldoh I would kneel in the
dust here before you

Some of the poetry you told me you write

Ive never written any poetry he said not looking up Perhaps I
cannow What I want to say isIm so ashamed of itI dont know how
to get the words out but I must I may never see you again and I must
I m sorryplease try to forgive meI wasnt myself when I did it

Blurt it out thats the best way

Im sorry he flounderedIm sorry I kissed you

She laughed her tired laugh and said in her tired voice the last words
he was ever destined to hear from her

Oh I dont mind if you dont It was so innocent it was what decided
me

One of the hundreds of good saints that belong to Rome must have
overheard her and pitied the young man for it is ascribable only to
some such special act of mercy that Mellin understood and he did
exactly what she meant

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
