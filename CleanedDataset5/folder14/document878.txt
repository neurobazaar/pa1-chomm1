 BURNS1



I CONFESS it I am keenly sensitive to skyey influences 2 I profess
no indifference to the movements of that capricious old gentleman
known as the clerk of the weather I cannot conceal my interest in the
behavior of that patriarchal bird whose wooden similitude gyrates on the
church spire Winter proper is well enough Let the thermometer go
to zero if it will so much the better if thereby the very winds are
frozen and unable to flap their stiff wings Sounds of bells in the keen
air clear musical heartinspiring quick tripping of fair moccasined
feet on glittering ice pavements bright eyes glancing above the
uplifted muff like a sultanas behind the folds of her _yashmak_3
schoolboys coasting down street like mad Greenlanders the cold
brilliance of oblique sunbeams flashing back from wide surfaces of
glittering snow or blazing upon ice jewelry of tree and roof there is
nothing in all this to complain of A storm of summer has its redeeming
sublimitiesits slow upheaving mountains of cloud glooming in the
western horizon like newcreated volcanoes veined with fire shattered
by exploding thunders Even the wild gales of the equinox have their
varietiessounds of windshaken woods and waters creak and clatter
of sign and casement hurricane puffs and downrushing rainspouts But
this dull dark autumn day of thaw and rain when the very clouds seem
too spiritless and languid to storm outright or take themselves out of
the way of fair weather wet beneath and above reminding one of
that rayless atmosphere of Dantes Third Circle where the infernal
Priessnitz4 administers his hydropathic torment

 A heavy cursed and relentless drench
 The land it soaks is putrid

or rather as everything animate and inanimate is seething in warm mist
suggesting the idea that Nature grown old and rheumatic is trying the
efficacy of a Thomsonian steambox5 on a grand scale no sounds
save the heavy plash of muddy feet on the pavements the monotonous
melancholy drip from trees and roofs the distressful gurgling of
waterducts swallowing the dirty amalgam of the gutters a dim
leadencolored horizon of only a few yards in diameter shutting down
about one beyond which nothing is visible save in faint line or
dark projection the ghost of a church spire or the eidolon of a
chimneypothe who can extract pleasurable emotions from the
alembic of such a day has a trick of alchemy with which I am wholly
unacquainted

 1 From the closing air in _The Jolly Beggars_ a cantata
 2 A breath thou art
 Servile to all the skyey influences
 That dost this habitation where thou keepst
 Hourly afflict
 Shakespeare _Measure for Measure_ act III scene 1
 3 She turns and turns again and carefully glances around
 her on all sides to see that she is safe from the eyes of
 Mussulmans and then suddenly withdrawing the yashmak she
 shines upon your heart and soul with all the pomp and might of
 her beauty Kinglakes _Eothen_ chap iii In a note to
 _Yashmak_ Kinglake explains that it is not a mere
 semitransparent veil but thoroughly conceals all the features
 except the eyes it is withdrawn by being pulled down
 4 Vincenz Priessnitz was the originator of the watercure
 After experimenting upon himself and his neighbors he took up
 the profession of hydropathy and established baths at his native
 place Grafenberg in Silesia in 1829 He died in 1851
 5 Dr Samuel Thomson a New Hampshire physician
 advocated the use of the steam bath as a restorer of system
 when diseased He died in 1843 and left behind an
 autobiography _Life and Medical Discoveries_ which
 contains a record of the persecutions he underwent

Hark a rap at my door Welcome anybody just now One gains nothing by
attempting to shut out the sprites of the weather They come in at the
keyhole they peer through the dripping panes they insinuate themselves
through the crevices of the casement or plump down chimney astride of
the raindrops

I rise and throw open the door A tall shambling loosejointed figure
a pinched shrewd face sunbrown and winddried small quickwinking
black eyesthere he stands the water dripping from his pulpy hat and
ragged elbows

I speak to him but he returns no answer With a dumb show of misery
quite touching he hands me a soiled piece of parchment whereon I read
what purports to be a melancholy account of shipwreck and disaster to
the particular detriment loss and damnification of one Pietro Frugoni
who is in consequence sorely in want of the alms of all charitable
Christian persons and who is in short the bearer of this veracious
document duly certified and indorsed by an Italian consul in one of
our Atlantic cities of a highsounding but to Yankee organs
unpronounceable name

Here commences a struggle Every man the Mahometans tell us has two
attendant angelsthe good one on his right shoulder the bad on his
left Give says Benevolence as with some difficulty I fish up a
small coin from the depths of my pocket Not a cent says selfish
Prudence and I drop it from my fingers Think says the good angel
of the poor stranger in a strange land just escaped from the terrors
of the seastorm in which his little property has perished thrown
halfnaked and helpless on our shores ignorant of our language and
unable to find employment suited to his capacity A vile impostor
replies the lefthand sentinel his paper purchased from one of those
readywriters in New York who manufacture beggarcredentials at the low
price of one dollar per copy with earthquakes fires or shipwrecks to
suit customers

Amidst this confusion of tongues I take another survey of my visitant
Ha a light dawns upon me That shrewd old face with its sharp
winking eyes is no stranger to me Pietro Frugoni I have seen thee
before _Si signor_ that face of thine has looked at me over a dirty
white neckcloth with the corners of that cunning mouth drawn downwards
and those small eyes turned up in sanctimonious gravity while thou wast
offering to a crowd of halfgrown boys an extemporaneous exhortation in
the capacity of a travelling preacher Have I not seen it peering out
from under a blanket as that of a poor Penobscot Indian who had lost
the use of his hands while trapping on the Madawaska Is it not the face
of the forlorn father of six small children whom the marcury doctors
had pisened and crippled Did it not belong to that downeast
unfortunate who had been out to the Genesee country1 and got the
fevernnager and whose hand shook so pitifully when held out to
receive my poor gift The same under all disguisesStephen Leathers
of Barringtonhim and none other Let me conjure him into his own
likeness

1 The _Genesee country_ is the name by which the western part of New
York bordering on Lakes Ontario and Erie was known when at the
close of the last and beginning of this century it was to people on
the Atlantic coast the Great West In 1792 communication was opened by
a road with the Pennsylvania settlements but the early settlers were
almost all from New England

Well Stephen what news from old Barrington

Oh well I thought I knew ye he answers not the least disconcerted
How do you do and hows your folks All well I hope I took this
ere paper you see to help a poor furriner who could nt make himself
understood any more than a wild goose I though Id just start him
forard a little It seemed a marcy to do it

Well and shiftily answered thou ragged Proteus One cannot be angry
with such a fellow I will just inquire into the present state of his
Gospel mission and about the condition of his tribe on the Penobscot
and it may be not amiss to congratulate him on the success of the
steamdoctors in sweating the pisen of the regular faculty out of him
But he evidently has no wish to enter into idle conversation Intent
upon his benevolent errand he is already clattering down stairs
Involuntarily I glance out of the window just in season to catch a
single glimpse of him ere he is swallowed up in the mist

He has gone and knave as he is I can hardly help exclaiming Luck
go with him He has broken in upon the sombre train of my thoughts
and called up before me pleasant and grateful recollections The old
farmhouse nestling in its valley hills stretching off to the south and
green meadows to the east the small stream which came noisily down its
ravine washing the old gardenwall and softly lapping on fallen stones
and mossy roots of beeches and hemlocks the tall sentinel poplars at
the gateway the oakforest sweeping unbroken to the northern horizon
the grassgrown carriagepath with its rude and crazy bridgethe
dear old landscape of my boyhood lies outstretched before me like a
daguerreotype from that picture within which I have borne with me in
all my wanderings I am a boy again once more conscious of the feeling
half terror half exultation with which I used to announce the approach
of this very vagabond and his kindred after the flesh

The advent of wandering beggars or old stragglers as we were wont
to call them was an event of no ordinary interest in the generally
monotonous quietude of our farmlife Many of them were well known they
had their periodical revolutions and transits we would calculate them
like eclipses or new moons Some were sturdy knaves fat and saucy and
whenever they ascertained that the men folks were absent would order
provisions and cider like men who expected to pay for them seating
themselves at the hearth or table with the air of FalstaffShall
I not take mine ease in mine inn Others poor pale patient like
Sternes monk1 came creeping up to the door hat in hand standing
there in their gray wretchedness with a look of heartbreak and
forlornness which was never without its effect on our juvenile
sensibilities At times however we experienced a slight revulsion of
feeling when even these humblest children of sorrow somewhat petulantly
rejected our proffered bread and cheese and demanded instead a glass of
cider Whatever the temperance society might in such cases have done
it was not in our hearts to refuse the poor creatures a draught of
their favorite beverage and was nt it a satisfaction to see their sad
melancholy faces light up as we handed them the full pitcher and on
receiving it back empty from their brown wrinkled hands to hear them
half breathless from their long delicious draught thanking us for the
favor as dear good children Not unfrequently these wandering tests
of our benevolence made their appearance in interesting groups of man
woman and child picturesque in their squalidness and manifesting
a maudlin affection which would have done honor to the revellers at
PoosieNansies immortal in the cantata of Burns 2 I remember some
who were evidently the victims of monomaniahaunted and hunted by some
dark thoughtpossessed by a fixed idea One a blackeyed wildhaired
woman with a whole tragedy of sin shame and suffering written in her
countenance used often to visit us warm herself by our winter fire
and supply herself with a stock of cakes and cold meat but was never
known to answer a question or to ask one She never smiled the cold
stony look of her eye never changed a silent impassive face frozen
rigid by some great wrong or sin We used to look with awe upon the
still woman and think of the demoniac of Scripture who had a dumb
spirit

 1 Whom he met at Calais as described in his _Sentimental
 Journey_
 2 The _cantata_ is _The Jolly Beggars_ from which the
 motto heading this sketch was taken _PoosieNansie_ was the
 keeper of a tavern in Mauchline which was the favorite resort
 of the lame sailors maimed soldiers travelling balladsingers
 and all such loose companions as hang about the skirts of
 society The cantata has for its theme the rivalry of a pigmy
 scraper with his fiddle and a strolling tinker for a beggar
 woman hence the _maudlin affection_

OneI think I see him now grim gaunt and ghastly working his slow
way up to our doorused to gather herbs by the wayside and called
himself doctor He was bearded like a hegoat and used to counterfeit
lameness yet when he supposed himself alone would travel on lustily
as if walking for a wager At length as if in punishment of his deceit
he met with an accident in his rambles and became lame in earnest
hobbling ever after with difficulty on his gnarled crutches Another
used to go stooping like Bunyans pilgrim under a pack made of an old
bedsacking stuffed out into most plethoric dimensions tottering on
a pair of small meagre legs and peering out with his wild hairy face
from under his burden like a bigbodied spider That man with the pack
always inspired me with awe and reverence Huge almost sublime in its
tense rotundity the father of all packs never laid aside and never
opened what might there not be within it With what fleshcreeping
curiosity I used to walk round about it at a safe distance half
expecting to see its striped covering stirred by the motions of a
mysterious life or that some evil monsters would leap out of it like
robbers from Ali Babas jars or armed men from the Trojan horse

There was another class of peripatetic philosophershalf pedler half
mendicantwho were in the habit of visiting us One we recollect a
lame unshaven sinistereyed unwholesome fellow with his basket of
old newspapers and pamphlets and his tattered blue umbrella serving
rather as a walkingstaff than as a protection from the rain He told
us on one occasion in answer to our inquiring into the cause of his
lameness that when a young man he was employed on the farm of the chief
magistrate of a neighboring State where as his ill luck would have it
the governors handsome daughter fell in love with him He was caught
one day in the young ladys room by her father whereupon the irascible
old gentleman pitched him unceremoniously out of the window laming
him for life on a brick pavement below like Vulcan on the rocks of
Lemnos1 As for the lady he assured us she took on dreadfully about
it Did she die we inquired anxiously There was a cunning twinkle
in the old rogues eye as he responded Well no she did nt She got
married

 1 It was upon the Isle of Lemnos that Vulcan was flung by
 Jupiter according to the myth for attempting to aid his mother
 Juno

Twice a year usually in the spring and autumn we were honored with a
call from Jonathan Plummer maker of verses pedler and poet physician
and parsona Yankee troubadourfirst and last minstrel of the valley
of the Merrimac encircled to my wondering young eyes with the very
nimbus of immortality He brought with him pins needles tape and
cottonthread for my mother jackknives razors and soap for
my father and verses of his own composing coarsely printed and
illustrated with rude woodcuts for the delectation of the younger
branches of the family No lovesick youth could drown himself no
deserted maiden bewail the moon no rogue mount the gallows without
fitting memorial in Plummers verses Earthquakes fires fevers and
shipwrecks he regarded as personal favors from Providence furnishing
the raw material of song and ballad Welcome to us in our country
seclusion as Autolycus to the clown in Winters Tale1 we listened
with infinite satisfaction to his reading of his own verses or to his
ready improvisation upon some domestic incident or topic suggested by
his auditors When once fairly over the difficulties at the outset of a
new subject his rhymes flowed freely as if he had eaten ballads and
all mens ears grew to his tunes His productions answered as
nearly as I can remember to Shakespeares description of a proper
balladdoleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant theme
sung lamentably He was scrupulously conscientious devout inclined
to theological disquisitions and withal mighty in Scripture He was
thoroughly independent flattered nobody cared for nobody trusted
nobody When invited to sit down at our dinnertable he invariably took
the precaution to place his basket of valuables between his legs for
safe keeping Never mind they basket Jonathan said my father
we shant steal thy verses I m not sure of that returned the
suspicious guest It is written Trust ye not in any brother

 1 He could never come better says the clown in
 Shakespeares _The Winters Tale_ when Autolycus the
 pedler is announced he shall come in I love a ballad but
 even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very
 pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably Act IV scene 4

Thou too O Parson Bwith thy pale students brow and rubicund
nose with thy rusty and tattered black coat overswept by white flowing
locks with thy professional white neckcloth scrupulously preserved
when even a shirt to thy back was problematicalart by no means to
be overlooked in the musterroll of vagrant gentlemen possessing the
_entree_ of our farmhouse Well do we remember with what grave and
dignified courtesy he used to step over its threshold saluting its
inmates with the same air of gracious condescension and patronage with
which in better days he had delighted the hearts of his parishioners
Poor old man He had once been the admired and almost worshipped
minister of the largest church in the town where he afterwards found
support in the winter season as a pauper He had early fallen into
intemperate habits and at the age of threescore and ten when I
remember him he was only sober when he lacked the means of being
otherwise Drunk or sober however he never altogether forgot the
proprieties of his profession he was always grave decorous and
gentlemanly he held fast the form of sound words and the weakness of
the flesh abated nothing of the rigor of his stringent theology He had
been a favorite pupil of the learned and astute Emmons1 and was to
the last a sturdy defender of the peculiar dogmas of his school
The last time we saw him he was holding a meeting in our district
schoolhouse with a vagabond pedler for deacon and travelling
companion The tie which united the illassorted couple was doubtless
the same which endeared Tam OShanter to the souter2

 They had been fou for weeks thegither

He took for his text the first seven verses of the concluding chapter of
Ecclesiastes furnishing in himself its fitting illustration The evil
days had come the keepers of the house trembled the windows of life
were darkened A few months later the silver cord was loosed the golden
bowl was broken and between the poor old man and the temptations which
beset him fell the thick curtains of the grave


 1 Nathaniel Emmons was a New England theologian of
 marked character and power who for seventy years was
 connected with a church in that part of Wrentham Mass now
 called Franklin He exercised considerable influence over the
 religious thought of New England and is still read by
 theologians He died in 1840 in his ninetysixth year
 2 Souter or cobbler Johnny in Burnss poetic tale of _Tam
 OShanter_ had been _fou_ or _full_ of drink with Tam for
 weeks together

One day we had a call from a pawky auld carle1 of a wandering
Scotchman To him I owe my first introduction to the songs of Burns
After eating his bread and cheese and drinking his mug of cider he gave
us Bonny Doon Highland Mary and Auld Lang Syne He had a rich full
voice and entered heartily into the spirit of his lyrics I have since
listened to the same melodies from the lips of Dempster2 than whom
the Scottish bard has had no sweeter or truer interpreter but
the skilful performance of the artist lacked the novel charm of the
gaberlunzies singing in the old farmhouse kitchen Another wanderer
made us acquainted with the humorous old ballad of Our gude man cam
hame at een He applied for supper and lodging and the next morning
was set at work splitting stones in the pasture While thus engaged
the village doctor came riding along the highway on his fine spirited
horse and stopped to talk with my father The fellow eyed the animal
attentively as if familiar with all his good points and hummed over a
stanza of the old poem

 Our gude man cam hame at een
 And hame cam he
 And there he saw a saddle horse
 Where nae horse should be
 How cam this horse here
 How can it be
 How cam this horse here
 Without the leave of me
 A horse quo she
 Ay a horse quo he
 Ye auld fool ye blind fool
 And blinder might ye be
 T is naething but a milking cow
 My mamma sent to me
 A milch cow quo he
 Ay a milch cow quo she
 Weel far hae I ridden
 And muckle hae I seen
 But milking cows wi saddles on
 Saw I never nane3

 1 From the first line of _The Gaberlunzie Man_ attributed
 to King James V of Scotland

 The pawky auld carle came oer the lee

 The original like Whittiers was a sly old fellow as an English
 phrase would translate the Scottish _The Gaberlunzie Man_ is
 given in Percys _Reliques of Ancient Poetry_ and in Childs
 _English and Scottish Ballads_ viii 98
 2 William R Dempster a Scottish vocalist who had
 recently sung in America and whose music to Burnss song A
 man s a man for a that was very popular
 3 The whole of this song may be found in Herds _Ancient
 and Modern Scottish Songs_ ii 172

That very night the rascal decamped taking with him the doctors horse
and was never after heard of

Often in the gray of the morning we used to see one or more
gaberlunzie men pack on shoulder and staff in hand emerging from the
barn or other outbuildings where they had passed the night I was once
sent to the barn to fodder the cattle late in the evening and climbing
into the mow to pitch down hay for that purpose I was startled by the
sudden apparition of a man rising up before me just discernible in the
dim moonlight streaming through the seams of the boards I made a rapid
retreat down the ladder and was only reassured by hearing the object
of my terror calling after me and recognizing his voice as that of a
harmless old pilgrim whom I had known before Our farmhouse was situated
in a lonely valley half surrounded with woods with no neighbors in
sight One dark cloudy night when our parents chanced to be absent
we were sitting with our aged grandmother in the fading light of the
kitchen fire working ourselves into a very satisfactory state of
excitement and terror by recounting to each other all the dismal stories
we could remember of ghosts witches haunted houses and robbers when
we were suddenly startled by a loud rap at the door A strippling of
fourteen I was very naturally regarded as the head of the household
so with many misgivings I advanced to the door which I slowly opened
holding the candle tremulously above my head and peering out into the
darkness The feeble glimmer played upon the apparition of a
gigantic horseman mounted on a steed of a size worthy of such a
ridercolossal motionless like images cut out of the solid night
The strange visitant gruffly saluted me and after making several
ineffectual efforts to urge his horse in at the door dismounted and
followed me into the room evidently enjoying the terror which his huge
presence excited Announcing himself as the great Indian doctor he
drew himself up before the fire stretched his arms clinched his fists
struck his broad chest and invited our attention to what he called
his mortal frame He demanded in succession all kinds of intoxicating
liquors and on being assured that we had none to give him he grew
angry threatened to swallow my younger brother alive and seizing me
by the hair of my head as the angel did the prophet at Babylon1 led
me about from room to room After an ineffectual search in the course
of which he mistook a jug of oil for one of brandy and contrary to my
explanations and remonstrances insisted upon swallowing a portion of
its contents he released me fell to crying and sobbing and confessed
that he was so drunk already that his horse was ashamed of him After
bemoaning and pitying himself to his satisfaction he wiped his eyes and
sat down by the side of my grandmother giving her to understand that he
was very much pleased with her appearance adding that if agreeable to
her he should like the privilege of paying his addresses to her While
vainly endeavoring to make the excellent old lady comprehend his very
flattering proposition he was interrupted by the return of my father
who at once understanding the matter turned him out of doors without
ceremony

 1 See Ezekiel viii 3

On one occasion a few years ago on my return from the field at
evening I was told that a foreigner had asked for lodgings during the
night but that influenced by his dark repulsive appearance my
mother had very reluctantly refused his request I found her by no means
satisfied with her decision What if a son of mine was in a strange
land she inquired selfreproachfully Greatly to her relief I
volunteered to go in pursuit of the wanderer and taking a crosspath
over the fields soon overtook him He had just been rejected at the
house of our nearest neighbor and was standing in a state of dubious
perplexity in the street He was an olivecomplexioned blackbearded
Italian with an eye like a live coal such a face as perchance looks
out on the traveller in the passes of the Abruzzi1one of those
bandit visages which Salvator2 has painted With some difficulty I
gave him to understand my errand when he overwhelmed me with thanks
and joyfully followed me back He took his seat with us at the
suppertable and when we were all gathered around the hearth that cold
autumnal evening he told us partly by words and partly by gestures
the story of his life and misfortunes amused us with descriptions of
the grapegatherings and festivals of his sunny clime edified my mother
with a recipe for making bread of chestnuts and in the morning when
after breakfast his dark sullen face lighted up and his fierce eye
moistened with grateful emotion as in his own silvery Tuscan accent he
poured out his thanks we marvelled at the fears which had so nearly
closed our door against him and as he departed we all felt that he
had left with us the blessing of the poor

 1 Provinces into which the old Kingdom of Naples was
 divided
 2 Salvator Rosa was a Neapolitan by birth and was said to
 have been himself a bandit in his youth his landscapes often
 contain figures drawn from the wild life of the region

It was not often that as in the above instance my mothers prudence
got the better of her charity The regular old stragglers regarded her
as an unfailing friend and the sight of her plain cap was to them an
assurance of forthcoming creaturecomforts There was indeed a tribe
of lazy strollers having their place of rendezvous in the town of
Barrington New Hampshire whose low vices had placed them beyond even
the pale of her benevolence They were not unconscious of their evil
reputation and experience had taught them the necessity of concealing
under wellcontrived disguises their true character They came to us
in all shapes and with all appearances save the true one with most
miserable stories of mishap and sickness and all the ills which flesh
is heir to It was particularly vexatious to discover when too late
that our sympathies and charities had been expended upon such graceless
vagabonds as the Barrington beggars An old withered hag known by the
appellation of Hopping Patthe wise woman of her tribewas in the
habit of visiting us with her hopeful grandson who had a gift for
preaching as well as for many other things not exactly compatible
with holy orders He sometimes brought with him a tame crow a shrewd
knavishlooking bird who when in the humor for it could talk like
Barnaby Rudges raven He used to say he could do nothin at exhortin
without a white handkercher on his neck and money in his pocketa
fact going far to confirm the opinions of the Bishop of Exeter and the
Puseyites generally that there can be no priest without tithes and
surplice

These people have for several generations lived distinct from the great
mass of the community like the gypsies of Europe whom in many respects
they closely resemble They have the same settled aversion to labor and
the same disposition to avail themselves of the fruits of the industry
of others They love a wild outofdoor life sing songs tell
fortunes and have an instinctive hatred of missionaries and cold
water It has been saidI know not upon what groundsthat their
ancestors were indeed a veritable importation of English gypsyhood but
if so they have undoubtedly lost a good deal of the picturesque charm
of its unhoused and free condition I very much fear that my friend
Mary Russell Mitfordsweetest of Englands rural painterswho has a
poets eye for the fine points in gypsy character would scarcely
allow their claims to fraternity with her own vagrant friends whose
campfires welcomed her to her new home at Swallowfield1

 1 See in Miss Mitfords _Our Village_

The proper study of mankind is man and according to my view no
phase of our common humanity is altogether unworthy of investigation
Acting upon this belief two or three summers ago when making in
company with my sister a little excursion into the hillcountry of New
Hampshire I turned my horses head towards Barrington for the purpose
of seeing these semicivilized strollers in their own home and
returning once for all their numerous visits Taking leave of our
hospitable cousins in old Lee with about as much solemnity as we may
suppose Major Laing1 parted with his friends when he set out in search
of desertgirdled Timbuctoo we drove several miles over a rough road
passed the Devils Den unmolested crossed a fretful little streamlet
noisily working its way into a valley where it turned a lonely
halfruinous mill and climbing a steep hill beyond saw before us a
wide sandy level skirted on the west and north by low scraggy hills
and dotted here and there with dwarf pitchpines In the centre of this
desolate region were some twenty or thirty small dwellings grouped
together as irregularly as a Hottentot kraal Unfenced unguarded open
to all comers and goers stood that city of the beggarsno wall
or paling between the ragged cabins to remind one of the jealous
distinctions of property The great idea of its founders seemed visible
in its unappropriated freedom Was not the whole round world their own
and should they haggle about boundaries and titledeeds For them on
distant plains ripened golden harvests for them in faroff workshops
busy hands were toiling for them if they had but the grace to note it
the broad earth put on her garniture of beauty and over them hung the
silent mystery of heaven and its stars That comfortable philosophy
which modern transcendentalism has but dimly shadowed forththat poetic
agrarianism which gives all to each and each to allis the real life
of this city of unwork To each of its dingy dwellers might be not
unaptly applied the language of one who I trust will pardon me for
quoting her beautiful poem in this connection

 Other hands may grasp the field and forest
 Proud proprietors in pomp may shine
       
 Thou art wealthierall the world is thine2

 1 Alexander Gordon Laing was a major in the British army
 who served on the west coast of Africa and made journeys into
 the interior in the attempt to establish commercial relations
 with the natives and especially to discover the sources of the
 Niger He was treacherously murdered in 1826 by the guard
 that was attending him on his return from Timbuctoo to the
 coast His travels excited great interest in their day in England
 and America
 2 From a poem _Why Thus Longing_ by Mrs Harriet
 Winslow Sewall preserved in Whittiers _Songs of Three
 Centuries_

But look the clouds are breaking Fair weather cometh out of the
north The wind has blown away the mists on the gilded spire of John
Street glimmers a beam of sunshine and there is the sky again hard
blue and cold in its eternal purity not a whit the worse for the
storm In the beautiful present the past is no longer needed Reverently
and gratefully let its volume be laid aside and when again the shadows
of the outward world fall upon the spirit may I not lack a good angel to
remind me of its solace even if he comes in the shape of a Barrington
beggar
