THE DUCHESS OF MALFI

by John Webster




INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Of John Websters life almost nothing is known The dates 15801625
given for his birth and death are conjectural inferences about which
the best that can be said is that no known facts contradict them

The first notice of Webster so far discovered shows that he was
collaborating in the production of plays for the theatrical manager
Henslowe in 1602 and of such collaboration he seems to have done
a considerable amount Four plays exist which he wrote alone
The White Devil The Duchess of Malfi The Devils LawCase
and Appius and Virginia

The Duchess of Malfi was published in 1623 but the date of writing
may have been as early as 1611 It is based on a story in Painters
Palace of Pleasure translated from the Italian novelist Bandello
and it is entirely possible that it has a foundation in fact In any
case it portrays with a terrible vividness one side of the court
life of the Italian Renaissance and its picture of the fierce quest
of pleasure the recklessness of crime and the worldliness of the
great princes of the Church finds only too ready corroboration in
the annals of the time

Websters tragedies come toward the close of the great series
of tragedies of blood and revenge in which The Spanish Tragedy
and Hamlet are landmarks but before decadence can fairly be said
to have set in He indeed loads his scene with horrors almost past
the point which modern taste can bear but the intensity of his
dramatic situations and his superb power of flashing in a single
line a light into the recesses of the human heart at the crises
of supreme emotion redeems him from mere sensationalism and places
his best things in the first rank of dramatic writing

 ACT I


 SCENE I1

 Enter ANTONIO and DELIO

 DELIO You are welcome to your country dear Antonio
 You have been long in France and you return
 A very formal Frenchman in your habit
 How do you like the French court

 ANTONIO I admire it
 In seeking to reduce both state and people
 To a fixd order their judicious king
 Begins at home quits first his royal palace
 Of flattering sycophants of dissolute
 And infamous personswhich he sweetly terms
 His masters masterpiece the work of heaven
 Considering duly that a princes court
 Is like a common fountain whence should flow
 Pure silver drops in general but if t chance
 Some cursd example poison t near the head
 Death and diseases through the whole land spread
 And what is t makes this blessed government
 But a most provident council who dare freely
 Inform him the corruption of the times
 Though some o the court hold it presumption
 To instruct princes what they ought to do
 It is a noble duty to inform them
 What they ought to foresee2Here comes Bosola
 The only courtgall yet I observe his railing
 Is not for simple love of piety
 Indeed he rails at those things which he wants
 Would be as lecherous covetous or proud
 Bloody or envious as any man
 If he had means to be soHeres the cardinal

 Enter CARDINAL and BOSOLA

 BOSOLA I do haunt you still

 CARDINAL So

 BOSOLA I have done you better service than to be slighted thus
 Miserable age where only the reward of doing well is the doing
 of it

 CARDINAL You enforce your merit too much

 BOSOLA I fell into the galleys in your service where for two
 years together I wore two towels instead of a shirt with a knot
 on the shoulder after the fashion of a Roman mantle Slighted thus
 I will thrive some way Blackbirds fatten best in hard weather
 why not I in these dogdays

 CARDINAL Would you could become honest

 BOSOLA With all your divinity do but direct me the way to it
 I have known many travel far for it and yet return as arrant knaves
 as they went forth because they carried themselves always along with
 them Exit CARDINAL Are you gone Some fellows they say
 are possessed with the devil but this great fellow were able
 to possess the greatest devil and make him worse

 ANTONIO He hath denied thee some suit

 BOSOLA He and his brother are like plumtrees that grow crooked
 over standingpools they are rich and oerladen with fruit but none
 but crows pies and caterpillars feed on them Could I be one
 of their flattering panders I would hang on their ears like a
 horseleech till I were full and then drop off I pray leave me
 Who would rely upon these miserable dependencies in expectation
 to be advancd tomorrow What creature ever fed worse than hoping
 Tantalus Nor ever died any man more fearfully than he that hoped
 for a pardon There are rewards for hawks and dogs when they have
 done us service but for a soldier that hazards his limbs in a
 battle nothing but a kind of geometry is his last supportation

 DELIO Geometry

 BOSOLA Ay to hang in a fair pair of slings take his latter swing
 in the world upon an honourable pair of crutches from hospital
 to hospital Fare ye well sir and yet do not you scorn us
 for places in the court are but like beds in the hospital where
 this mans head lies at that mans foot and so lower and lower
 Exit

 DELIO I knew this fellow seven years in the galleys
 For a notorious murder and twas thought
 The cardinal subornd it he was releasd
 By the French general Gaston de Foix
 When he recoverd Naples

 ANTONIO Tis great pity
 He should be thus neglected I have heard
 He s very valiant This foul melancholy
 Will poison all his goodness for I ll tell you
 If too immoderate sleep be truly said
 To be an inward rust unto the soul
 If then doth follow want of action
 Breeds all black malcontents and their close rearing
 Like moths in cloth do hurt for want of wearing


 SCENE II3

 ANTONIO DELIO Enter SILVIO CASTRUCCIO JULIA RODERIGO
 and GRISOLAN

 DELIO The presence gins to fill you promisd me
 To make me the partaker of the natures
 Of some of your great courtiers

 ANTONIO The lord cardinals
 And other strangers that are now in court
 I shallHere comes the great Calabrian duke

 Enter FERDINAND and Attendants

 FERDINAND Who took the ring oftenest4

 SILVIO Antonio Bologna my lord

 FERDINAND Our sister duchess greatmaster of her household
 Give him the jewelWhen shall we leave this sportive action
 and fall to action indeed

 CASTRUCCIO Methinks my lord you should not desire to go to war
 in person

 FERDINAND Now for some gravityWhy my lord

 CASTRUCCIO It is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince but not
 necessary a prince descend to be a captain

 FERDINAND No

 CASTRUCCIO No my lord he were far better do it by a deputy

 FERDINAND Why should he not as well sleep or eat by a deputy
 This might take idle offensive and base office from him whereas
 the other deprives him of honour

 CASTRUCCIO Believe my experience that realm is never long in quiet
 where the ruler is a soldier

 FERDINAND Thou toldest me thy wife could not endure fighting

 CASTRUCCIO True my lord

 FERDINAND And of a jest she broke of5 a captain she met full of
 wounds I have forgot it

 CASTRUCCIO She told him my lord he was a pitiful fellow to lie
 like the children of Ismael all in tents6

 FERDINAND Why theres a wit were able to undo all the
 chirurgeons7 o the city for although gallants should quarrel
 and had drawn their weapons and were ready to go to it yet her
 persuasions would make them put up

 CASTRUCCIO That she would my lordHow do you like my Spanish
 gennet8

 RODERIGO He is all fire

 FERDINAND I am of Plinys opinion I think he was begot
 by the wind he runs as if he were ballassd9 with quicksilver

 SILVIO True my lord he reels from the tilt often

 RODERIGO GRISOLAN Ha ha ha

 FERDINAND Why do you laugh Methinks you that are courtiers
 should be my touchwood take fire when I give fire that is
 laugh when I laugh were the subject never so witty

 CASTRUCCIO True my lord I myself have heard a very good jest
 and have scornd to seem to have so silly a wit as to understand it

 FERDINAND But I can laugh at your fool my lord

 CASTRUCCIO He cannot speak you know but he makes faces my lady
 cannot abide him

 FERDINAND No

 CASTRUCCIO Nor endure to be in merry company for she says too much
 laughing and too much company fills her too full of the wrinkle

 FERDINAND I would then have a mathematical instrument made
 for her face that she might not laugh out of compassI shall
 shortly visit you at Milan Lord Silvio

 SILVIO Your grace shall arrive most welcome

 FERDINAND You are a good horseman Antonio you have excellent
 riders in France what do you think of good horsemanship

 ANTONIO Nobly my lord as out of the Grecian horse issued many
 famous princes so out of brave horsemanship arise the first sparks
 of growing resolution that raise the mind to noble action

 FERDINAND You have bespoke it worthily

 SILVIO Your brother the lord cardinal and sister duchess

 Enter CARDINAL with DUCHESS and CARIOLA

 CARDINAL Are the galleys come about

 GRISOLAN They are my lord

 FERDINAND Here s the Lord Silvio is come to take his leave

 DELIO Now sir your promise what s that cardinal
 I mean his temper They say he s a brave fellow
 Will play his five thousand crowns at tennis dance
 Court ladies and one that hath fought single combats

 ANTONIO Some such flashes superficially hang on him for form
 but observe his inward character he is a melancholy churchman
 The spring in his face is nothing but the engendring of toads
 where he is jealous of any man he lays worse plots for them than
 ever was imposd on Hercules for he strews in his way flatterers
 panders intelligencers atheists and a thousand such political
 monsters He should have been Pope but instead of coming to it
 by the primitive decency of the church he did bestow bribes
 so largely and so impudently as if he would have carried it away
 without heavens knowledge Some good he hath done

 DELIO You have given too much of him What s his brother

 ANTONIO The duke there A most perverse and turbulent nature
 What appears in him mirth is merely outside
 If he laught heartily it is to laugh
 All honesty out of fashion

 DELIO Twins

 ANTONIO In quality
 He speaks with others tongues and hears mens suits
 With others ears will seem to sleep o the bench
 Only to entrap offenders in their answers
 Dooms men to death by information
 Rewards by hearsay

 DELIO Then the law to him
 Is like a foul black cobweb to a spider
 He makes it his dwelling and a prison
 To entangle those shall feed him

 ANTONIO Most true
 He never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns
 And those he will confess that he doth owe
 Last for this brother there the cardinal
 They that do flatter him most say oracles
 Hang at his lips and verily I believe them
 For the devil speaks in them
 But for their sister the right noble duchess
 You never fixd your eye on three fair medals
 Cast in one figure of so different temper
 For her discourse it is so full of rapture
 You only will begin then to be sorry
 When she doth end her speech and wish in wonder
 She held it less vainglory to talk much
 Than your penance to hear her Whilst she speaks
 She throws upon a man so sweet a look
 That it were able to raise one to a galliard10
 That lay in a dead palsy and to dote
 On that sweet countenance but in that look
 There speaketh so divine a continence
 As cuts off all lascivious and vain hope
 Her days are practisd in such noble virtue
 That sure her nights nay more her very sleeps
 Are more in heaven than other ladies shrifts
 Let all sweet ladies break their flattring glasses
 And dress themselves in her

 DELIO Fie Antonio
 You play the wiredrawer with her commendations

 ANTONIO I ll case the picture up only thus much
 All her particular worth grows to this sum
 She stains11 the time past lights the time to come

 CARIOLA You must attend my lady in the gallery
 Some half and hour hence

 ANTONIO I shall
 Exeunt ANTONIO and DELIO

 FERDINAND Sister I have a suit to you

 DUCHESS To me sir

 FERDINAND A gentleman here Daniel de Bosola
 One that was in the galleys

 DUCHESS Yes I know him

 FERDINAND A worthy fellow he is pray let me entreat for
 The provisorship of your horse

 DUCHESS Your knowledge of him
 Commends him and prefers him

 FERDINAND Call him hither
 Exit Attendant
 We are now upon12 parting Good Lord Silvio
 Do us commend to all our noble friends
 At the leaguer

 SILVIO Sir I shall

 DUCHESS You are for Milan

 SILVIO I am

 DUCHESS Bring the caroches13We ll bring you down
 To the haven
 Exeunt DUCHESS SILVIO CASTRUCCIO RODERIGO GRISOLAN
 CARIOLA JULIA and Attendants

 CARDINAL Be sure you entertain that Bosola
 For your intelligence14 I would not be seen in t
 And therefore many times I have slighted him
 When he did court our furtherance as this morning

 FERDINAND Antonio the greatmaster of her household
 Had been far fitter

 CARDINAL You are deceivd in him
 His nature is too honest for such business
 He comes I ll leave you
 Exit

 Reenter BOSOLA

 BOSOLA I was lurd to you

 FERDINAND My brother here the cardinal could never
 Abide you

 BOSOLA Never since he was in my debt

 FERDINAND May be some oblique character in your face
 Made him suspect you

 BOSOLA Doth he study physiognomy
 There s no more credit to be given to the face
 Than to a sick mans urine which some call
 The physicians whore because she cozens15 him
 He did suspect me wrongfully

 FERDINAND For that
 You must give great men leave to take their times
 Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceivd
 You see the oft shaking of the cedartree
 Fastens it more at root

 BOSOLA Yet take heed
 For to suspect a friend unworthily
 Instructs him the next way to suspect you
 And prompts him to deceive you

 FERDINAND There s gold

 BOSOLA So
 What follows Aside Never raind such showers as these
 Without thunderbolts i the tail of themWhose throat must I cut

 FERDINAND Your inclination to shed blood rides post
 Before my occasion to use you I give you that
 To live i the court here and observe the duchess
 To note all the particulars of her haviour
 What suitors do solicit her for marriage
 And whom she best affects She s a young widow
 I would not have her marry again

 BOSOLA No sir

 FERDINAND Do not you ask the reason but be satisfied
 I say I would not

 BOSOLA It seems you would create me
 One of your familiars

 FERDINAND Familiar What s that

 BOSOLA Why a very quaint invisible devil in flesh
 An intelligencer16

 FERDINAND Such a kind of thriving thing
 I would wish thee and ere long thou mayst arrive
 At a higher place by t

 BOSOLA Take your devils
 Which hell calls angels These cursd gifts would make
 You a corrupter me an impudent traitor
 And should I take these theyd take me to hell

 FERDINAND Sir I ll take nothing from you that I have given
 There is a place that I procurd for you
 This morning the provisorship o the horse
 Have you heard on t

 BOSOLA No

 FERDINAND Tis yours is t not worth thanks

 BOSOLA I would have you curse yourself now that your bounty
 Which makes men truly noble eer should make me
 A villain O that to avoid ingratitude
 For the good deed you have done me I must do
 All the ill man can invent Thus the devil
 Candies all sins oer and what heaven terms vile
 That names he complimental

 FERDINAND Be yourself
 Keep your old garb of melancholy twill express
 You envy those that stand above your reach
 Yet strive not to come near em This will gain
 Access to private lodgings where yourself
 May like a politic dormouse

 BOSOLA As I have seen some
 Feed in a lords dish half asleep not seeming
 To listen to any talk and yet these rogues
 Have cut his throat in a dream What s my place
 The provisorship o the horse Say then my corruption
 Grew out of horsedung I am your creature

 FERDINAND Away
 Exit

 BOSOLA Let good men for good deeds covet good fame
 Since place and riches oft are bribes of shame
 Sometimes the devil doth preach
 Exit


 Scene III17

 Enter FERDINAND DUCHESS CARDINAL and CARIOLA

 CARDINAL We are to part from you and your own discretion
 Must now be your director

 FERDINAND You are a widow
 You know already what man is and therefore
 Let not youth high promotion eloquence

 CARDINAL No
 Nor anything without the addition honour
 Sway your high blood

 FERDINAND Marry they are most luxurious18
 Will wed twice

 CARDINAL O fie

 FERDINAND Their livers are more spotted
 Than Labans sheep19

 DUCHESS Diamonds are of most value
 They say that have passd through most jewellers hands

 FERDINAND Whores by that rule are precious

 DUCHESS Will you hear me
 I ll never marry

 CARDINAL So most widows say
 But commonly that motion lasts no longer
 Than the turning of an hourglass the funeral sermon
 And it end both together

 FERDINAND Now hear me
 You live in a rank pasture here i the court
 There is a kind of honeydew that s deadly
 T will poison your fame look to t Be not cunning
 For they whose faces do belie their hearts
 Are witches ere they arrive at twenty years
 Ay and give the devil suck

 DUCHESS This is terrible good counsel

 FERDINAND Hypocrisy is woven of a fine small thread
 Subtler than Vulcans engine20 yet believe t
 Your darkest actions nay your privatst thoughts
 Will come to light

 CARDINAL You may flatter yourself
 And take your own choice privately be married
 Under the eaves of night

 FERDINAND Think t the best voyage
 That eer you made like the irregular crab
 Which though t goes backward thinks that it goes right
 Because it goes its own way but observe
 Such weddings may more properly be said
 To be executed than celebrated

 CARDINAL The marriage night
 Is the entrance into some prison

 FERDINAND And those joys
 Those lustful pleasures are like heavy sleeps
 Which do forerun mans mischief

 CARDINAL Fare you well
 Wisdom begins at the end remember it
 Exit

 DUCHESS I think this speech between you both was studied
 It came so roundly off

 FERDINAND You are my sister
 This was my fathers poniard do you see
 I d be loth to see t look rusty cause twas his
 I would have you give oer these chargeable revels
 A visor and a mask are whisperingrooms
 That were never built for goodnessfare ye well
 And women like variety of courtship
 What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale
 Make a woman believe Farewell lusty widow
 Exit

 DUCHESS Shall this move me If all my royal kindred
 Lay in my way unto this marriage
 I d make them my low footsteps And even now
 Even in this hate as men in some great battles
 By apprehending danger have achievd
 Almost impossible actions I have heard soldiers say so
 So I through frights and threatenings will assay
 This dangerous venture Let old wives report
 I winkd and chose a husbandCariola
 To thy known secrecy I have given up
 More than my lifemy fame

 CARIOLA Both shall be safe
 For I ll conceal this secret from the world
 As warily as those that trade in poison
 Keep poison from their children

 DUCHESS Thy protestation
 Is ingenious and hearty I believe it
 Is Antonio come

 CARIOLA He attends you

 DUCHESS Good dear soul
 Leave me but place thyself behind the arras
 Where thou mayst overhear us Wish me good speed
 For I am going into a wilderness
 Where I shall find nor path nor friendly clue
 To be my guide
 Cariola goes behind the arras
 Enter ANTONIO
 I sent for you sit down
 Take pen and ink and write are you ready

 ANTONIO Yes

 DUCHESS What did I say

 ANTONIO That I should write somewhat

 DUCHESS O I remember
 After these triumphs and this large expense
 It s fit like thrifty husbands21 we inquire
 What s laid up for tomorrow

 ANTONIO So please your beauteous excellence

 DUCHESS Beauteous
 Indeed I thank you I look young for your sake
 You have taen my cares upon you

 ANTONIO I ll fetch your grace
 The particulars of your revenue and expense

 DUCHESS O you are
 An upright treasurer but you mistook
 For when I said I meant to make inquiry
 What s laid up for tomorrow I did mean
 What s laid up yonder for me

 ANTONIO Where

 DUCHESS In heaven
 I am making my will as tis fit princes should
 In perfect memory and I pray sir tell me
 Were not one better make it smiling thus
 Than in deep groans and terrible ghastly looks
 As if the gifts we parted with procurd22
 That violent distraction

 ANTONIO O much better

 DUCHESS If I had a husband now this care were quit
 But I intend to make you overseer
 What good deed shall we first remember Say

 ANTONIO Begin with that first good deed began i the world
 After mans creation the sacrament of marriage
 I d have you first provide for a good husband
 Give him all

 DUCHESS All

 ANTONIO Yes your excellent self

 DUCHESS In a windingsheet

 ANTONIO In a couple

 DUCHESS Saint Winifred that were a strange will

 ANTONIO Twere stranger23 if there were no will in you
 To marry again

 DUCHESS What do you think of marriage

 ANTONIO I take t as those that deny purgatory
 It locally contains or heaven or hell
 There s no third place in t

 DUCHESS How do you affect it

 ANTONIO My banishment feeding my melancholy
 Would often reason thus

 DUCHESS Pray let s hear it

 ANTONIO Say a man never marry nor have children
 What takes that from him Only the bare name
 Of being a father or the weak delight
 To see the little wanton ride acockhorse
 Upon a painted stick or hear him chatter
 Like a taught starling

 DUCHESS Fie fie what s all this
 One of your eyes is bloodshot use my ring to t
 They say tis very sovereign Twas my weddingring
 And I did vow never to part with it
 But to my second husband

 ANTONIO You have parted with it now

 DUCHESS Yes to help your eyesight

 ANTONIO You have made me stark blind

 DUCHESS How

 ANTONIO There is a saucy and ambitious devil
 Is dancing in this circle

 DUCHESS Remove him

 ANTONIO How

 DUCHESS There needs small conjuration when your finger
 May do it thus Is it fit
 She puts the ring upon his finger he kneels

 ANTONIO What said you

 DUCHESS Sir
 This goodly roof of yours is too low built
 I cannot stand upright in t nor discourse
 Without I raise it higher Raise yourself
 Or if you please my hand to help you so
 Raises him

 ANTONIO Ambition madam is a great mans madness
 That is not kept in chains and closepent rooms
 But in fair lightsome lodgings and is girt
 With the wild noise of prattling visitants
 Which makes it lunatic beyond all cure
 Conceive not I am so stupid but I aim24
 Whereto your favours tend but he s a fool
 That being acold would thrust his hands i the fire
 To warm them

 DUCHESS So now the ground s broke
 You may discover what a wealthy mine
 I make your lord of

 ANTONIO O my unworthiness

 DUCHESS You were ill to sell yourself
 This darkning of your worth is not like that
 Which tradesmen use i the city their false lights
 Are to rid bad wares off and I must tell you
 If you will know where breathes a complete man
 I speak it without flattery turn your eyes
 And progress through yourself

 ANTONIO Were there nor heaven nor hell
 I should be honest I have long servd virtue
 And neer taen wages of her

 DUCHESS Now she pays it
 The misery of us that are born great
 We are forcd to woo because none dare woo us
 And as a tyrant doubles with his words
 And fearfully equivocates so we
 Are forcd to express our violent passions
 In riddles and in dreams and leave the path
 Of simple virtue which was never made
 To seem the thing it is not Go go brag
 You have left me heartless mine is in your bosom
 I hope twill multiply love there You do tremble
 Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh
 To fear more than to love me Sir be confident
 What is t distracts you This is flesh and blood sir
 Tis not the figure cut in alabaster
 Kneels at my husbands tomb Awake awake man
 I do here put off all vain ceremony
 And only do appear to you a young widow
 That claims you for her husband and like a widow
 I use but half a blush in t

 ANTONIO Truth speak for me
 I will remain the constant sanctuary
 Of your good name

 DUCHESS I thank you gentle love
 And cause you shall not come to me in debt
 Being now my steward here upon your lips
 I sign your Quietus est25 This you should have beggd now
 I have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus
 As fearful to devour them too soon

 ANTONIO But for your brothers

 DUCHESS Do not think of them
 All discord without this circumference
 Is only to be pitied and not feard
 Yet should they know it time will easily
 Scatter the tempest

 ANTONIO These words should be mine
 And all the parts you have spoke if some part of it
 Would not have savourd flattery

 DUCHESS Kneel
 Cariola comes from behind the arras

 ANTONIO Ha

 DUCHESS Be not amazd this woman s of my counsel
 I have heard lawyers say a contract in a chamber
 Per verba de presenti26 is absolute marriage
 She and ANTONIO kneel
 Bless heaven this sacred gordian27 which let violence
 Never untwine

 ANTONIO And may our sweet affections like the spheres
 Be still in motion

 DUCHESS Quickening and make
 The like soft music

 ANTONIO That we may imitate the loving palms
 Best emblem of a peaceful marriage
 That never bore fruit divided

 DUCHESS What can the church force more

 ANTONIO That fortune may not know an accident
 Either of joy or sorrow to divide
 Our fixed wishes

 DUCHESS How can the church build faster28
 We now are man and wife and tis the church
 That must but echo thisMaid stand apart
 I now am blind

 ANTONIO What s your conceit in this

 DUCHESS I would have you lead your fortune by the hand
 Unto your marriagebed
 You speak in me this for we now are one
 We ll only lie and talk together and plot
 To appease my humorous29 kindred and if you please
 Like the old tale in ALEXANDER AND LODOWICK
 Lay a naked sword between us keep us chaste
 O let me shrowd my blushes in your bosom
 Since tis the treasury of all my secrets
 Exeunt DUCHESS and ANTONIO

 CARIOLA Whether the spirit of greatness or of woman
 Reign most in her I know not but it shows
 A fearful madness I owe her much of pity
 Exit



 Act II


 Scene I30

 Enter BOSOLA and CASTRUCCIO

 BOSOLA You say you would fain be taken for an eminent courtier

 CASTRUCCIO Tis the very main31 of my ambition

 BOSOLA Let me see you have a reasonable good face for t already
 and your nightcap expresses your ears sufficient largely I would
 have you learn to twirl the strings of your band with a good grace
 and in a set speech at th end of every sentence to hum three
 or four times or blow your nose till it smart again to recover your
 memory When you come to be a president in criminal causes if you
 smile upon a prisoner hang him but if you frown upon him and
 threaten him let him be sure to scape the gallows

 CASTRUCCIO I would be a very merry president

 BOSOLA Do not sup o nights twill beget you an admirable wit

 CASTRUCCIO Rather it would make me have a good stomach to quarrel
 for they say your roaring boys eat meat seldom and that makes them
 so valiant But how shall I know whether the people take me for
 an eminent fellow

 BOSOLA I will teach a trick to know it give out you lie adying
 and if you hear the common people curse you be sure you are taken
 for one of the prime nightcaps32
 Enter an Old Lady
 You come from painting now

 OLD LADY From what

 BOSOLA Why from your scurvy facephysic To behold thee not
 painted inclines somewhat near a miracle These in thy face here
 were deep ruts and foul sloughs the last progress33 There was
 a lady in France that having had the smallpox flayed the skin off
 her face to make it more level and whereas before she looked
 like a nutmeggrater after she resembled an abortive hedgehog

 OLD LADY Do you call this painting

 BOSOLA No no but you call it careening34 of an old
 morphewed35 lady to make her disembogue36 again
 there s roughcast phrase to your plastic37

 OLD LADY It seems you are well acquainted with my closet

 BOSOLA One would suspect it for a shop of witchcraft to find in it
 the fat of serpents spawn of snakes Jews spittle and their young
 childrens ordure and all these for the face I would sooner eat
 a dead pigeon taken from the soles of the feet of one sick of the
 plague than kiss one of you fasting Here are two of you whose sin
 of your youth is the very patrimony of the physician makes him renew
 his footcloth with the spring and change his highpricd courtezan
 with the fall of the leaf I do wonder you do not loathe yourselves
 Observe my meditation now
 What thing is in this outward form of man
 To be belovd We account it ominous
 If nature do produce a colt or lamb
 A fawn or goat in any limb resembling
 A man and fly from t as a prodigy
 Man stands amazd to see his deformity
 In any other creature but himself
 But in our own flesh though we bear diseases
 Which have their true names only taen from beasts
 As the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measle
 Though we are eaten up of lice and worms
 And though continually we bear about us
 A rotten and dead body we delight
 To hide it in rich tissue all our fear
 Nay all our terror is lest our physician
 Should put us in the ground to be made sweet
 Your wife s gone to Rome you two couple and get you to
 the wells at Lucca to recover your aches I have other work on foot
 Exeunt CASTRUCCIO and Old Lady
 I observe our duchess
 Is sick adays she pukes her stomach seethes
 The fins of her eyelids look most teeming blue38
 She wanes i the cheek and waxes fat i the flank
 And contrary to our Italian fashion
 Wears a loosebodied gown there s somewhat in t
 I have a trick may chance discover it
 A pretty one I have bought some apricocks
 The first our spring yields

 Enter ANTONIO and DELIO talking together apart

 DELIO And so long since married
 You amaze me

 ANTONIO Let me seal your lips for ever
 For did I think that anything but th air
 Could carry these words from you I should wish
 You had no breath at allNow sir in your contemplation
 You are studying to become a great wise fellow

 BOSOLA O sir the opinion of wisdom is a foul tetter39
 that runs all over a mans body if simplicity direct us to have
 no evil it directs us to a happy being for the subtlest folly
 proceeds from the subtlest wisdom let me be simply honest

 ANTONIO I do understand your inside

 BOSOLA Do you so

 ANTONIO Because you would not seem to appear to th world
 Puffd up with your preferment you continue
 This outoffashion melancholy leave it leave it

 BOSOLA Give me leave to be honest in any phrase in any compliment
 whatsoever Shall I confess myself to you I look no higher than
 I can reach they are the gods that must ride on winged horses
 A lawyers mule of a slow pace will both suit my disposition and
 business for mark me when a mans mind rides faster than his horse
 can gallop they quickly both tire

 ANTONIO You would look up to heaven but I think
 The devil that rules i th air stands in your light

 BOSOLA O sir you are lord of the ascendant40 chief man with
 the duchess a duke was your cousingerman removd Say you were
 lineally descended from King Pepin or he himself what of this
 Search the heads of the greatest rivers in the world you shall find
 them but bubbles of water Some would think the souls of princes
 were brought forth by some more weighty cause than those of meaner
 persons they are deceivd there s the same hand to them the like
 passions sway them the same reason that makes a vicar go to law for
 a tithepig and undo his neighbours makes them spoil a whole
 province and batter down goodly cities with the cannon

 Enter DUCHESS and Ladies

 DUCHESS Your arm Antonio do I not grow fat

 Such a one as the Duchess of Florence rode in

 BOSOLA The duchess usd one when she was great with child

 DUCHESS I think she didCome hither mend my ruff
 Here when thou art such a tedious lady and
 Thy breath smells of lemonpills would thou hadst done
 Shall I swoon under thy fingers I am
 So troubled with the mother41

 BOSOLA Aside I fear too much

 DUCHESS I have heard you say that the French courtiers
 Wear their hats on fore that king

 ANTONIO I have seen it

 DUCHESS In the presence

 ANTONIO Yes

 DUCHESS Why should not we bring up that fashion
 Tis ceremony more than duty that consists
 In the removing of a piece of felt
 Be you the example to the rest o th court
 Put on your hat first

 ANTONIO You must pardon me
 I have seen in colder countries than in France
 Nobles stand bare to th prince and the distinction
 Methought showd reverently

 BOSOLA I have a present for your grace

 DUCHESS For me sir

 BOSOLA Apricocks madam

 DUCHESS O sir where are they
 I have heard of none toyear42

 We shall have none this month

 BOSOLA Will not your grace pare them

 DUCHESS No they taste of musk methinks indeed they do

 BOSOLA I know not yet I wish your grace had pard em

 DUCHESS Why

 BOSOLA I forgot to tell you the knave gardener
 Only to raise his profit by them the sooner
 Did ripen them in horsedung

 DUCHESS O you jest

 ANTONIO Indeed madam

 DUCHESS Sir you are loth
 To rob us of our dainties Tis a delicate fruit
 They say they are restorative

 BOSOLA Tis a pretty art
 This grafting

 DUCHESS Tis so a bettering of nature

 BOSOLA To make a pippin grow upon a crab
 A damson on a blackthornAside How greedily she eats them
 A whirlwind strike off these bawd farthingales
 For but for that and the loosebodied gown
 I should have discoverd apparently43
 The young springal44 cutting a caper in her belly

 DUCHESS I thank you Bosola they were right good ones
 If they do not make me sick

 ANTONIO How now madam

 Lest the physicians should repoison her

 ANTONIO I am lost in amazement I know not what to think on t

 BOSOLA So so there s no question but her techiness46

 of breeding now

 OLD LADY I am in haste sir

 BOSOLA There was a young waitingwoman had a monstrous desire
 to see the glasshouse

 OLD LADY Nay pray let me go I will hear no more
 of the glasshouse You are still47 abusing women

 BOSOLA Who I No only by the way now and then mention your
 frailties The orangetree bears ripe and green fruit and blossoms
 all together and some of you give entertainment for pure love
 but more for more precious reward The lusty spring smells well
 but drooping autumn tastes well If we have the same golden showers
 that rained in the time of Jupiter the thunderer you have the same
 Danaes still to hold up their laps to receive them Didst thou
 never study the mathematics

 OLD LADY What s that sir

 BOSOLA Why to know the trick how to make a many lines meet in one
 centre Go go give your fosterdaughters good counsel tell them
 that the devil takes delight to hang at a womans girdle like
 a false rusty watch that she cannot discern how the time passes

 You are this night dear friend to post to Rome
 My life lies in your service

 DELIO Do not doubt me

 ANTONIO O tis far from me and yet fear presents me
 Somewhat that looks like danger

 DELIO Believe it
 Tis but the shadow of your fear no more
 How superstitiously we mind our evils
 The throwing down salt or crossing of a hare
 Bleeding at nose the stumbling of a horse
 Or singing of a cricket are of power
 To daunt whole man in us Sir fare you well
 I wish you all the joys of a blessd father
 And for my faith lay this unto your breast
 Old friends like old swords still are trusted best

 Scene III51

 Enter BOSOLA with a dark lantern

 BOSOLA Sure I did hear a woman shriek list ha
 And the sound came if I receivd it right
 From the duchess lodgings There s some stratagem
 In the confining all our courtiers
 To their several wards I must have part of it
 My intelligence will freeze else List again
 It may be twas the melancholy bird
 Best friend of silence and of solitariness
 The owl that screamed soHa Antonio

 Enter ANTONIO with a candle his sword drawn

 ANTONIO I heard some noiseWho s there What art thou Speak

 BOSOLA Antonio put not your face nor body
 To such a forcd expression of fear

 BOSOLA Not I did you

 ANTONIO I did or else I dreamd

 BOSOLA Let s walk towards it

 ANTONIO No it may be twas
 But the rising of the wind

 BOSOLA Very likely
 Methinks tis very cold and yet you sweat
 You look wildly

 ANTONIO I have been setting a figure52
 For the duchess jewels

 BOSOLA Ah and how falls your question
 Do you find it radical53

 ANTONIO What s that to you
 Tis rather to be questiond what design
 When all men were commanded to their lodgings
 Makes you a nightwalker

 BOSOLA In sooth I ll tell you
 Now all the court s asleep I thought the devil
 Had least to do here I came to say my prayers
 And if it do offend you I do so
 You are a fine courtier

 ANTONIO Aside This fellow will undo me
 You gave the duchess apricocks today
 Pray heaven they were not poisond

 BOSOLA Poisond a Spanish fig
 For the imputation

 ANTONIO Traitors are ever confident
 Till they are discoverd There were jewels stoln too
 In my conceit none are to be suspected
 More than yourself

 BOSOLA You are a false steward

 ANTONIO Saucy slave I ll pull thee up by the roots

 BOSOLA May be the ruin will crush you to pieces

 ANTONIO You are an impudent snake indeed sir
 Are you scarce warm and do you show your sting
 You libel54 well sir

 BOSOLA No sir copy it out
 And I will set my hand to t

 ANTONIO Aside My nose bleeds
 One that were superstitious would count
 This ominous when it merely comes by chance
 Two letters that are wrought here for my name55
 Are drownd in blood
 Mere accidentFor you sir I ll take order
 I the morn you shall be safeAside Tis that must colour
 Her lyinginSir this door you pass not
 I do not hold it fit that you come near
 The duchess lodgings till you have quit yourself
 Aside The great are like the base nay they are the same
 When they seek shameful ways to avoid shame

 and Mars being in a human sign joined to the tail of the
 Dragon in the eighth house doth threaten a violent death
 Caetera non scrutantur57

 Why now tis most apparent this precise fellow
 Is the duchess bawdI have it to my wish
 This is a parcel of intelligency58
 Our courtiers were casd up for it needs must follow
 That I must be committed on pretence
 Of poisoning her which I ll endure and laugh at
 If one could find the father now but that
 Time will discover Old Castruccio
 I th morning posts to Rome by him I ll send
 A letter that shall make her brothers galls
 Oerflow their livers This was a thrifty59 way
 Though lust do mask in neer so strange disguise

 CARDINAL Thou art a witty false one

 JULIA You have prevaild with me
 Beyond my strongest thoughts I would not now
 Find you inconstant

 CARDINAL Do not put thyself
 To such a voluntary torture which proceeds
 Out of your own guilt

 JULIA How my lord

 CARDINAL You fear
 My constancy because you have approvd62
 Those giddy and wild turnings in yourself

 JULIA Did you eer find them

 CARDINAL Sooth generally for women
 A man might strive to make glass malleable
 Ere he should make them fixed

 JULIA So my lord

 CARDINAL We had need go borrow that fantastic glass
 Invented by Galileo the Florentine
 To view another spacious world i th moon
 And look to find a constant woman there

 JULIA This is very well my lord

 CARDINAL Why do you weep
 Are tears your justification The selfsame tears
 Will fall into your husbands bosom lady
 With a loud protestation that you love him
 Above the world Come I ll love you wisely
 That s jealously since I am very certain
 You cannot make me cuckold

 JULIA I ll go home
 To my husband

 CARDINAL You may thank me lady
 I have taken you off your melancholy perch
 Bore you upon my fist and showd you game
 And let you fly at itI pray thee kiss me
 When thou wast with thy husband thou wast watchd
 Like a tame elephantstill you are to thank me
 Thou hadst only kisses from him and high feeding
 But what delight was that Twas just like one
 That hath a little fingring on the lute
 Yet cannot tune itstill you are to thank me

 JULIA You told me of a piteous wound i th heart
 And a sick liver when you wood me first
 And spake like one in physic63

 For I know none by him

 JULIA I hear he s come to Rome

 DELIO I never knew man and beast of a horse and a knight
 So weary of each other If he had had a good back
 He would have undertook to have borne his horse
 His breech was so pitifully sore

 JULIA Your laughter

 You want money but I have brought you some

 JULIA I must hear the condition ere I be bound to take it

 DELIO Very fine
 Is this her wit or honesty that speaks thus

 Shows his ambition now Unfortunate fortune

 Who the event weigh ere the action s done

 Scene V66

 Enter CARDINAL and FERDINAND with a letter

 FERDINAND I have this night diggd up a mandrake67

 CARDINAL Say you

 FERDINAND And I am grown mad with t

 CARDINAL What s the prodigy

 FERDINAND
 Read therea sister damnd she s loose i the hilts68
 Grown a notorious strumpet

 CARDINAL Speak lower

 FERDINAND Lower
 Rogues do not whisper t now but seek to publish t
 As servants do the bounty of their lords
 Aloud and with a covetous searching eye
 To mark who note them O confusion seize her
 She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn
 And more secure conveyances for lust
 Than towns of garrison for service

 CARDINAL Is t possible
 Can this be certain

 FERDINAND Rhubarb O for rhubarb
 To purge this choler Here s the cursed day
 To prompt my memory and here t shall stick
 Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge
 To wipe it out

 CARDINAL Why do you make yourself
 So wild a tempest

 FERDINAND Would I could be one
 That I might toss her palace bout her ears
 Root up her goodly forests blast her meads
 And lay her general territory as waste
 As she hath done her honours

 CARDINAL Shall our blood
 The royal blood of Arragon and Castile
 Be thus attainted

 FERDINAND Apply desperate physic
 We must not now use balsamum but fire
 The smarting cuppingglass for that s the mean
 To purge infected blood such blood as hers
 There is a kind of pity in mine eye
 I ll give it to my handkercher and now tis here
 I ll bequeath this to her bastard

 CARDINAL What to do

 FERDINAND Why to make soft lint for his mothers wounds
 When I have hewd her to pieces

 CARDINAL Cursd creature
 Unequal nature to place womens hearts
 So far upon the left side69

 FERDINAND Foolish men
 That eer will trust their honour in a bark
 Made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman
 Apt every minute to sink it

 CARDINAL Thus ignorance when it hath purchasd honour
 It cannot wield it

 FERDINAND Methinks I see her laughing
 Excellent hyena Talk to me somewhat quickly
 Or my imagination will carry me
 To see her in the shameful act of sin

 CARDINAL With whom

 FERDINAND Happily with some strongthighd bargeman
 Or one o th woodyard that can quoit the sledge70
 Or toss the bar or else some lovely squire
 That carries coals up to her privy lodgings

 CARDINAL You fly beyond your reason

 FERDINAND Go to mistress
 Tis not your whores milk that shall quench my wildfire
 But your whores blood

 CARDINAL How idly shows this rage which carries you
 As men conveyd by witches through the air
 On violent whirlwinds This intemperate noise
 Fitly resembles deaf mens shrill discourse
 Who talk aloud thinking all other men
 To have their imperfection

 FERDINAND Have not you
 My palsy

 CARDINAL Yes but I can be angry
 Without this rupture There is not in nature
 A thing that makes man so deformd so beastly
 As doth intemperate anger Chide yourself
 You have divers men who never yet expressd
 Their strong desire of rest but by unrest
 By vexing of themselves Come put yourself
 In tune

 FERDINAND So I will only study to seem
 The thing I am not I could kill her now
 In you or in myself for I do think
 It is some sin in us heaven doth revenge
 By her

 CARDINAL Are you stark mad

 FERDINAND I would have their bodies
 Burnt in a coalpit with the ventage stoppd
 That their cursd smoke might not ascend to heaven
 Or dip the sheets they lie in in pitch or sulphur
 Wrap them in t and then light them like a match
 Or else toboil71 their bastard to a cullis
 And give t his lecherous father to renew
 The sin of his back

 CARDINAL I ll leave you

 FERDINAND Nay I have done
 I am confident had I been damnd in hell
 And should have heard of this it would have put me
 Into a cold sweat In in I ll go sleep
 Till I know who loves my sister I ll not stir
 That known I ll find scorpions to string my whips
 And fix her in a general eclipse
 Exeunt



 Act III


 Scene I72

 Enter ANTONIO and DELIO

 ANTONIO Our noble friend my most beloved Delio
 O you have been a stranger long at court
 Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand

 DELIO I did sir and how fares your noble duchess

 ANTONIO Right fortunately well she s an excellent
 Feeder of pedigrees since you last saw her
 She hath had two children more a son and daughter

 DELIO Methinks twas yesterday Let me but wink
 And not behold your face which to mine eye
 Is somewhat leaner verily I should dream
 It were within this half hour

 ANTONIO You have not been in law friend Delio
 Nor in prison nor a suitor at the court
 Nor beggd the reversion of some great mans place
 Nor troubled with an old wife which doth make
 Your time so insensibly hasten

 DELIO Pray sir tell me
 Hath not this news arrivd yet to the ear
 Of the lord cardinal

 ANTONIO I fear it hath
 The Lord Ferdinand that s newly come to court
 Doth bear himself right dangerously

 DELIO Pray why

 ANTONIO He is so quiet that he seems to sleep
 The tempest out as dormice do in winter
 Those houses that are haunted are most still
 Till the devil be up

 DELIO What say the common people

 ANTONIO The common rabble do directly say
 She is a strumpet

 DELIO And your graver heads
 Which would be politic what censure they

 ANTONIO They do observe I grow to infinite purchase73
 The left hand way and all suppose the duchess
 Would amend it if she could for say they
 Great princes though they grudge their officers
 Should have such large and unconfined means
 To get wealth under them will not complain
 Lest thereby they should make them odious
 Unto the people For other obligation
 Of love or marriage between her and me
 They never dream of

 DELIO The Lord Ferdinand
 Is going to bed

 Enter DUCHESS FERDINAND and Attendants

 FERDINAND I ll instantly to bed
 For I am wearyI am to bespeak
 A husband for you

 DUCHESS For me sir Pray who is t

 FERDINAND The great Count Malatesti

 DUCHESS Fie upon him
 A count He s a mere stick of sugarcandy
 You may look quite through him When I choose
 A husband I will marry for your honour

 FERDINAND You shall do well in tHow is t worthy Antonio

 DUCHESS But sir I am to have private conference with you
 About a scandalous report is spread
 Touching mine honour

 FERDINAND Let me be ever deaf to t
 One of Pasquils paperbullets74 courtcalumny
 A pestilent air which princes palaces
 Are seldom purgd of Yet say that it were true
 I pour it in your bosom my fixd love
 Would strongly excuse extenuate nay deny
 Faults were they apparent in you Go be safe
 In your own innocency

 DUCHESS Aside O blessd comfort
 This deadly air is purgd
 Exeunt DUCHESS ANTONIO DELIO and Attendants

 FERDINAND Her guilt treads on
 Hotburning coulters75
 Enter BOSOLA
 Now Bosola
 How thrives our intelligence76

 BOSOLA Sir uncertainly
 Tis rumourd she hath had three bastards but
 By whom we may go read i the stars

 FERDINAND Why some
 Hold opinion all things are written there

 BOSOLA Yes if we could find spectacles to read them
 I do suspect there hath been some sorcery
 Usd on the duchess

 FERDINAND Sorcery to what purpose

 BOSOLA To make her dote on some desertless fellow
 She shames to acknowledge

 FERDINAND Can your faith give way
 To think there s power in potions or in charms
 To make us love whether we will or no

 BOSOLA Most certainly

 FERDINAND Away these are mere gulleries77 horrid things
 Invented by some cheating mountebanks
 To abuse us Do you think that herbs or charms
 Can force the will Some trials have been made
 In this foolish practice but the ingredients
 Were lenitive78 poisons such as are of force
 To make the patient mad and straight the witch
 Swears by equivocation they are in love
 The witchcraft lies in her rank blood This night
 I will force confession from her You told me
 You had got within these two days a false key
 Into her bedchamber

 BOSOLA I have

 FERDINAND As I would wish

 BOSOLA What do you intend to do

 FERDINAND Can you guess

 BOSOLA No

 FERDINAND Do not ask then
 He that can compass me and know my drifts
 May say he hath put a girdle bout the world
 And sounded all her quicksands

 BOSOLA I do not
 Think so

 FERDINAND What do you think then pray

 BOSOLA That you
 Are your own chronicle too much and grossly
 Flatter yourself

 FERDINAND Give me thy hand I thank thee
 I never gave pension but to flatterers
 Till I entertained thee Farewell
 That friend a great mans ruin strongly checks
 Who rails into his belief all his defects
 Exeunt


 Scene II79

 Enter DUCHESS ANTONIO and CARIOLA

 DUCHESS Bring me the casket hither and the glass
 You get no lodging here tonight my lord

 ANTONIO Indeed I must persuade one

 DUCHESS Very good
 I hope in time twill grow into a custom
 That noblemen shall come with cap and knee
 To purchase a nights lodging of their wives

 ANTONIO I must lie here

 DUCHESS Must You are a lord of misrule

 ANTONIO Indeed my rule is only in the night

 DUCHESS I ll stop your mouth
 Kisses him

 ANTONIO Nay that s but one Venus had two soft doves
 To draw her chariot I must have another
 She kisses him again
 When wilt thou marry Cariola

 CARIOLA Never my lord

 ANTONIO O fie upon this single life forgo it
 We read how Daphne for her peevish flight80
 Became a fruitless baytree Syrinx turnd
 To the pale empty reed Anaxarete
 Was frozen into marble whereas those
 Which married or provd kind unto their friends
 Were by a gracious influence transhapd
 Into the olive pomegranate mulberry
 Became flowers precious stones or eminent stars

 CARIOLA This is a vain poetry but I pray you tell me
 If there were proposd me wisdom riches and beauty
 In three several young men which should I choose

 ANTONIO Tis a hard question This was Paris case
 And he was blind in t and there was a great cause
 For how was t possible he could judge right
 Having three amorous goddesses in view
 And they stark naked Twas a motion
 Were able to benight the apprehension
 Of the severest counsellor of Europe
 Now I look on both your faces so well formd
 It puts me in mind of a question I would ask

 CARIOLA What is t

 ANTONIO I do wonder why hardfavourd ladies
 For the most part keep worsefavourd waitingwomen
 To attend them and cannot endure fair ones

 DUCHESS O that s soon answerd
 Did you ever in your life know an ill painter
 Desire to have his dwelling next door to the shop
 Of an excellent picturemaker Twould disgrace
 His facemaking and undo him I prithee
 When were we so merryMy hair tangles

 ANTONIO Pray thee Cariola let s steal forth the room
 And let her talk to herself I have divers times
 Servd her the like when she hath chafd extremely
 I love to see her angry Softly Cariola
 Exeunt ANTONIO and CARIOLA

 DUCHESS Doth not the colour of my hair gin to change
 When I wax gray I shall have all the court
 Powder their hair with arras81 to be like me
 You have cause to love me I entred you into my heart
 Enter FERDINAND unseen
 Before you would vouchsafe to call for the keys
 We shall one day have my brothers take you napping
 Methinks his presence being now in court
 Should make you keep your own bed but you ll say
 Love mixd with fear is sweetest I ll assure you
 You shall get no more children till my brothers
 Consent to be your gossips Have you lost your tongue
 Tis welcome
 For know whether I am doomd to live or die
 I can do both like a prince

 FERDINAND Die then quickly
 Giving her a poniard
 Virtue where art thou hid What hideous thing
 Is it that doth eclipse thee

 DUCHESS Pray sir hear me

 FERDINAND Or is it true thou art but a bare name
 And no essential thing

 DUCHESS Sir

 FERDINAND Do not speak

 DUCHESS No sir
 I will plant my soul in mine ears to hear you

 FERDINAND O most imperfect light of human reason
 That makst us so unhappy to foresee
 What we can least prevent Pursue thy wishes
 And glory in them there s in shame no comfort
 But to be past all bounds and sense of shame

 DUCHESS I pray sir hear me I am married

 FERDINAND So

 DUCHESS Happily not to your liking but for that
 Alas your shears do come untimely now
 To clip the birds wings that s already flown
 Will you see my husband

 FERDINAND Yes if I could change
 Eyes with a basilisk

 DUCHESS Sure you came hither
 By his confederacy

 FERDINAND The howling of a wolf
 Is music to thee screechowl prithee peace
 Whateer thou art that hast enjoyd my sister
 For I am sure thou hearst me for thine own sake
 Let me not know thee I came hither prepard
 To work thy discovery yet am now persuaded
 It would beget such violent effects
 As would damn us both I would not for ten millions
 I had beheld thee therefore use all means
 I never may have knowledge of thy name
 Enjoy thy lust still and a wretched life
 On that conditionAnd for thee vile woman
 If thou do wish thy lecher may grow old
 In thy embracements I would have thee build
 Such a room for him as our anchorites
 To holier use inhabit Let not the sun
 Shine on him till he s dead let dogs and monkeys
 Only converse with him and such dumb things
 To whom nature denies use to sound his name
 Do not keep a paraquito lest she learn it
 If thou do love him cut out thine own tongue
 Lest it bewray him

 DUCHESS Why might not I marry
 I have not gone about in this to create
 Any new world or custom

 FERDINAND Thou art undone
 And thou hast taen that massy sheet of lead
 That hid thy husbands bones and folded it
 About my heart

 DUCHESS Mine bleeds for t

 FERDINAND Thine thy heart
 What should I name t unless a hollow bullet
 Filld with unquenchable wildfire

 DUCHESS You are in this
 Too strict and were you not my princely brother
 I would say too wilful my reputation
 Is safe

 FERDINAND Dost thou know what reputation is
 I ll tell theeto small purpose since the instruction
 Comes now too late
 Upon a time Reputation Love and Death
 Would travel oer the world and it was concluded
 That they should part and take three several ways
 Death told them they should find him in great battles
 Or cities plagud with plagues Love gives them counsel
 To inquire for him mongst unambitious shepherds
 Where dowries were not talkd of and sometimes
 Mongst quiet kindred that had nothing left
 By their dead parents Stay quoth Reputation
 Do not forsake me for it is my nature
 If once I part from any man I meet
 I am never found again And so for you
 You have shook hands with Reputation
 And made him invisible So fare you well
 I will never see you more

 DUCHESS Why should only I
 Of all the other princes of the world
 Be casd up like a holy relic I have youth
 And a little beauty

 FERDINAND So you have some virgins
 That are witches I will never see thee more
 Exit

 Reenter ANTONIO with a pistol and CARIOLA

 DUCHESS You saw this apparition

 ANTONIO Yes we are
 Betrayd How came he hither I should turn
 This to thee for that

 CARIOLA Pray sir do and when
 That you have cleft my heart you shall read there
 Mine innocence

 DUCHESS That gallery gave him entrance

 ANTONIO I would this terrible thing would come again
 That standing on my guard I might relate
 My warrantable love
 She shows the poniard
 Ha what means this

 DUCHESS He left this with me

 ANTONIO And it seems did wish
 You would use it on yourself

 DUCHESS His action seemd
 To intend so much

 ANTONIO This hath a handle to t
 As well as a point turn it towards him and
 So fasten the keen edge in his rank gall
 Knocking within
 How now who knocks More earthquakes

 DUCHESS I stand
 As if a mine beneath my feet were ready
 To be blown up

 CARIOLA Tis Bosola

 DUCHESS Away
 O misery methinks unjust actions
 Should wear these masks and curtains and not we
 You must instantly part hence I have fashiond it already
 Exit ANTONIO

 Enter BOSOLA

 BOSOLA The duke your brother is taen up in a whirlwind
 Hath took horse and s rid post to Rome

 DUCHESS So late

 BOSOLA He told me as he mounted into the saddle
 You were undone

 DUCHESS Indeed I am very near it

 BOSOLA What s the matter

 DUCHESS Antonio the master of our household
 Hath dealt so falsely with me in s accounts
 My brother stood engagd with me for money
 Taen up of certain Neapolitan Jews
 And Antonio lets the bonds be forfeit

 BOSOLA StrangeAside This is cunning

 DUCHESS And hereupon
 My brothers bills at Naples are protested
 AgainstCall up our officers

 BOSOLA I shall
 Exit

 Reenter ANTONIO

 DUCHESS The place that you must fly to is Ancona
 Hire a house there I ll send after you
 My treasure and my jewels Our weak safety
 Runs upon enginous wheels82 short syllables
 Must stand for periods I must now accuse you
 Of such a feigned crime as Tasso calls
 Magnanima menzogna a noble lie
 Cause it must shield our honoursHark they are coming

 Reenter BOSOLA and Officers

 ANTONIO Will your grace hear me

 DUCHESS I have got well by you you have yielded me
 A million of loss I am like to inherit
 The peoples curses for your stewardship
 You had the trick in audittime to be sick
 Till I had signd your quietus83 and that curd you
 Without help of a doctorGentlemen
 I would have this man be an example to you all
 So shall you hold my favour I pray let him
 For has done that alas you would not think of
 And because I intend to be rid of him
 I mean not to publishUse your fortune elsewhere

 ANTONIO I am strongly armd to brook my overthrow
 As commonly men bear with a hard year
 I will not blame the cause on t but do think
 The necessity of my malevolent star
 Procures this not her humour O the inconstant
 And rotten ground of service You may see
 Tis even like him that in a winter night
 Takes a long slumber oer a dying fire
 Aloth to part from t yet parts thence as cold
 As when he first sat down

 DUCHESS We do confiscate
 Towards the satisfying of your accounts
 All that you have

 ANTONIO I am all yours and tis very fit
 All mine should be so

 DUCHESS So sir you have your pass

 ANTONIO You may see gentlemen what tis to serve
 A prince with body and soul
 Exit

 BOSOLA Here s an example for extortion what moisture is drawn
 out of the sea when foul weather comes pours down and runs into
 the sea again

 DUCHESS I would know what are your opinions
 Of this Antonio

 SECOND OFFICER He could not abide to see a pigs head gaping
 I thought your grace would find him a Jew

 THIRD OFFICER I would you had been his officer for your own sake

 FOURTH OFFICER You would have had more money

 FIRST OFFICER He stopped his ears with black wool and to those came
 to him for money said he was thick of hearing

 SECOND OFFICER Some said he was an hermaphrodite for he could not
 abide a woman

 FOURTH OFFICER How scurvy proud he would look when the treasury
 was full Well let him go

 FIRST OFFICER Yes and the chippings of the buttery fly after him
 to scour his gold chain84

 DUCHESS Leave us
 Exeunt Officers
 What do you think of these

 BOSOLA That these are rogues that in s prosperity
 But to have waited on his fortune could have wishd
 His dirty stirrup riveted through their noses
 And followd after s mule like a bear in a ring
 Would have prostituted their daughters to his lust
 Made their firstborn intelligencers85 thought none happy
 But such as were born under his blest planet
 And wore his livery and do these lice drop off now
 Well never look to have the like again
 He hath left a sort86 of flattering rogues behind him
 Their doom must follow Princes pay flatterers
 In their own money flatterers dissemble their vices
 And they dissemble their lies that s justice
 Alas poor gentleman

 DUCHESS Poor he hath amply filld his coffers

 BOSOLA Sure he was too honest Pluto87 the god of riches
 When he s sent by Jupiter to any man
 He goes limping to signify that wealth
 That comes on Gods name comes slowly but when hes sent
 On the devils errand he rides post and comes in by scuttles88
 Let me show you what a most unvalud jewel
 You have in a wanton humour thrown away
 To bless the man shall find him He was an excellent
 Courtier and most faithful a soldier that thought it
 As beastly to know his own value too little
 As devilish to acknowledge it too much
 Both his virtue and form deservd a far better fortune
 His discourse rather delighted to judge itself than show itself
 His breast was filld with all perfection
 And yet it seemed a private whispringroom
 It made so little noise of t

 DUCHESS But he was basely descended

 BOSOLA Will you make yourself a mercenary herald
 Rather to examine mens pedigrees than virtues
 You shall want89 him
 For know an honest statesman to a prince
 Is like a cedar planted by a spring
 The spring bathes the trees root the grateful tree
 Rewards it with his shadow you have not done so
 I would sooner swim to the Bermoothes on
 Two politicians rotten bladders tied
 Together with an intelligencers heartstring
 Than depend on so changeable a princes favour
 Fare thee well Antonio Since the malice of the world
 Would needs down with thee it cannot be said yet
 That any ill happend unto thee considering thy fall
 Was accompanied with virtue

 DUCHESS O you render me excellent music

 BOSOLA Say you

 DUCHESS This good one that you speak of is my husband

 BOSOLA Do I not dream Can this ambitious age
 Have so much goodness in t as to prefer
 A man merely for worth without these shadows
 Of wealth and painted honours Possible

 DUCHESS I have had three children by him

 BOSOLA Fortunate lady
 For you have made your private nuptial bed
 The humble and fair seminary of peace
 No question but many an unbeneficd scholar
 Shall pray for you for this deed and rejoice
 That some preferment in the world can yet
 Arise from merit The virgins of your land
 That have no dowries shall hope your example
 Will raise them to rich husbands Should you want
 Soldiers twould make the very Turks and Moors
 Turn Christians and serve you for this act
 Last the neglected poets of your time
 In honour of this trophy of a man
 Raisd by that curious engine your white hand
 Shall thank you in your grave for t and make that
 More reverend than all the cabinets
 Of living princes For Antonio
 His fame shall likewise flow from many a pen
 When heralds shall want coats to sell to men

 DUCHESS As I taste comfort in this friendly speech
 So would I find concealment

 BOSOLA O the secret of my prince
 Which I will wear on th inside of my heart

 DUCHESS You shall take charge of all my coin and jewels
 And follow him for he retires himself
 To Ancona

 BOSOLA So

 DUCHESS Whither within few days
 I mean to follow thee

 BOSOLA Let me think
 I would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage
 To our Lady of Loretto scarce seven leagues
 From fair Ancona so may you depart
 Your country with more honour and your flight
 Will seem a princely progress retaining
 Your usual train about you

 DUCHESS Sir your direction
 Shall lead me by the hand

 CARIOLA In my opinion
 She were better progress to the baths at Lucca
 Or go visit the Spa
 In Germany for if you will believe me
 I do not like this jesting with religion
 This feigned pilgrimage

 DUCHESS Thou art a superstitious fool
 Prepare us instantly for our departure
 Past sorrows let us moderately lament them
 For those to come seek wisely to prevent them
 Exeunt DUCHESS and CARIOLA

 BOSOLA A politician is the devils quilted anvil
 He fashions all sins on him and the blows
 Are never heard he may work in a ladys chamber
 As here for proof What rests90 but I reveal
 All to my lord O this base quality91
 Of intelligencer Why every quality i the world
 Prefers but gain or commendation
 Now for this act I am certain to be raisd
 And men that paint weeds to the life are praisd
 Exit


 Scene III92

 Enter CARDINAL FERDINAND MALATESTI PESCARA DELIO
 and SILVIO

 CARDINAL Must we turn soldier then

 MALATESTI The emperor
 Hearing your worth that way ere you attaind
 This reverend garment joins you in commission
 With the right fortunate soldier the Marquis of Pescara
 And the famous Lannoy

 CARDINAL He that had the honour
 Of taking the French king prisoner

 MALATESTI The same
 Here s a plot drawn for a new fortification
 At Naples

 FERDINAND This great Count Malatesti I perceive
 Hath got employment

 DELIO No employment my lord
 A marginal note in the musterbook that he is
 A voluntary lord

 FERDINAND He s no soldier

 DELIO He has worn gunpowder in s hollow tooth for the toothache

 SILVIO He comes to the leaguer with a full intent
 To eat fresh beef and garlic means to stay
 Till the scent be gone and straight return to court

 DELIO He hath read all the late service
 As the CityChronicle relates it
 And keeps two pewterers going only to express
 Battles in model

 SILVIO Then he ll fight by the book

 DELIO By the almanac I think
 To choose good days and shun the critical
 That s his mistress scarf

 SILVIO Yes he protests
 He would do much for that taffeta

 DELIO I think he would run away from a battle
 To save it from taking prisoner

 SILVIO He is horribly afraid
 Gunpowder will spoil the perfume on t

 DELIO I saw a Dutchman break his pate once
 For calling him potgun he made his head
 Have a bore in t like a musket

 SILVIO I would he had made a touchhole to t
 He is indeed a guarded sumptercloth93
 Only for the remove of the court

 Enter BOSOLA

 PESCARA Bosola arrivd What should be the business
 Some fallingout amongst the cardinals
 These factions amongst great men they are like
 Foxes when their heads are divided
 They carry fire in their tails and all the country
 About them goes to wrack for t

 SILVIO What s that Bosola

 DELIO I knew him in Paduaa fantastical scholar like such who
 study to know how many knots was in Hercules club of what colour
 Achilles beard was or whether Hector were not troubled with the
 toothache He hath studied himself half bleareyed to know the true
 symmetry of Caesars nose by a shoeinghorn and this he did to gain
 the name of a speculative man

 PESCARA Mark Prince Ferdinand
 A very salamander lives in s eye
 To mock the eager violence of fire

 SILVIO That cardinal hath made more bad faces with his oppression
 than ever Michael Angelo made good ones He lifts up s nose like
 a foul porpoise before a storm

 PESCARA The Lord Ferdinand laughs

 DELIO Like a deadly cannon
 That lightens ere it smokes

 PESCARA These are your true pangs of death
 The pangs of life that struggle with great statesmen

 DELIO In such a deformed silence witches whisper their charms

 CARDINAL Doth she make religion her ridinghood
 To keep her from the sun and tempest

 FERDINAND That that damns her Methinks her fault and beauty
 Blended together show like leprosy
 The whiter the fouler I make it a question
 Whether her beggarly brats were ever christned

 CARDINAL I will instantly solicit the state of Ancona
 To have them banishd

 FERDINAND You are for Loretto
 I shall not be at your ceremony fare you well
 Write to the Duke of Malfi my young nephew
 She had by her first husband and acquaint him
 With s mothers honesty

 BOSOLA I will

 FERDINAND Antonio
 A slave that only smelld of ink and counters
 And never in s life lookd like a gentleman
 But in the audittimeGo go presently
 Draw me out an hundred and fifty of our horse
 And meet me at the footbridge
 Exeunt


 Scene IV

 Enter Two Pilgrims to the Shrine of our Lady of Loretto

 FIRST PILGRIM I have not seen a goodlier shrine than this
 Yet I have visited many

 SECOND PILGRIM The Cardinal of Arragon
 Is this day to resign his cardinals hat
 His sister duchess likewise is arrivd
 To pay her vow of pilgrimage I expect
 A noble ceremony

 FIRST PILGRIM No questionThey come

 Here the ceremony of the Cardinals instalment in the habit
 of a soldier performd in delivering up his cross hat robes
 and ring at the shrine and investing him with sword helmet
 shield and spurs then ANTONIO the DUCHESS and their children
 having presented themselves at the shrine are by a form
 of banishment in dumbshow expressed towards them by the
 CARDINAL and the state of Ancona banished during all which
 ceremony this ditty is sung to very solemn music by divers
 churchmen and then exeunt all except the Two Pilgrims

 Arms and honours deck thy story
 To thy fames eternal glory
 Adverse fortune ever fly thee
 No disastrous fate come nigh thee

 I alone will sing thy praises
 Whom to honour virtue raises
 And thy study that divine is
 Bent to martial discipline is
 Lay aside all those robes lie by thee
 Crown thy arts with arms they ll beautify thee

 O worthy of worthiest name adornd in this manner
 Lead bravely thy forces on under wars warlike banner
 O mayst thou prove fortunate in all martial courses
 Guide thou still by skill in arts and forces
 Victory attend thee nigh whilst fame sings loud thy powers
 Triumphant conquest crown thy head and blessings pour down
 showers94

 FIRST PILGRIM
 Here s a strange turn of state who would have thought
 So great a lady would have matchd herself
 Unto so mean a person Yet the cardinal
 Bears himself much too cruel

 SECOND PILGRIM They are banishd

 FIRST PILGRIM But I would ask what power hath this state
 Of Ancona to determine of a free prince

 SECOND PILGRIM They are a free state sir and her brother showd
 How that the Pope forehearing of her looseness
 Hath seizd into th protection of the church
 The dukedom which she held as dowager

 FIRST PILGRIM But by what justice

 SECOND PILGRIM Sure I think by none
 Only her brothers instigation

 FIRST PILGRIM What was it with such violence he took
 Off from her finger

 SECOND PILGRIM Twas her weddingring
 Which he vowd shortly he would sacrifice
 To his revenge

 FIRST PILGRIM Alas Antonio
 If that a man be thrust into a well
 No matter who sets hand to t his own weight
 Will bring him sooner to th bottom Come let s hence
 Fortune makes this conclusion general
 All things do help th unhappy man to fall
 Exeunt


 Scene V95

 Enter DUCHESS ANTONIO Children CARIOLA and Servants

 DUCHESS Banishd Ancona

 ANTONIO Yes you see what power
 Lightens in great mens breath

 DUCHESS Is all our train
 Shrunk to this poor remainder

 ANTONIO These poor men
 Which have got little in your service vow
 To take your fortune but your wiser buntings96
 Now they are fledgd are gone

 DUCHESS They have done wisely
 This puts me in mind of death physicians thus
 With their hands full of money use to give oer
 Their patients

 ANTONIO Right the fashion of the world
 From decayd fortunes every flatterer shrinks
 Men cease to build where the foundation sinks

 DUCHESS I had a very strange dream tonight

 ANTONIO What was t

 DUCHESS Methought I wore my coronet of state
 And on a sudden all the diamonds
 Were changd to pearls

 ANTONIO My interpretation
 Is you ll weep shortly for to me the pearls
 Do signify your tears

 DUCHESS The birds that live i th field
 On the wild benefit of nature live
 Happier than we for they may choose their mates
 And carol their sweet pleasures to the spring

 Enter BOSOLA with a letter

 BOSOLA You are happily oertaen

 DUCHESS From my brother

 BOSOLA Yes from the Lord Ferdinand your brother
 All love and safety

 DUCHESS Thou dost blanch mischief
 Wouldst make it white See see like to calm weather
 At sea before a tempest false hearts speak fair
 To those they intend most mischief
 Reads Send Antonio to me I want his head in a business
 A politic equivocation
 He doth not want your counsel but your head
 That is he cannot sleep till you be dead
 And here s another pitfall that s strewd oer
 With roses mark it tis a cunning one
 Reads
 I stand engaged for your husband for several debts at Naples
 let not that trouble him I had rather have his heart than his
 money
 And I believe so too

 BOSOLA What do you believe

 DUCHESS That he so much distrusts my husbands love
 He will by no means believe his heart is with him
 Until he see it the devil is not cunning enough
 To circumvent us In riddles

 BOSOLA Will you reject that noble and free league
 Of amity and love which I present you

 DUCHESS Their league is like that of some politic kings
 Only to make themselves of strength and power
 To be our afterruin tell them so

 BOSOLA And what from you

 ANTONIO Thus tell him I will not come

 BOSOLA And what of this

 ANTONIO My brothers have dispersd
 Bloodhounds abroad which till I hear are muzzld
 No truce though hatchd with neer such politic skill
 Is safe that hangs upon our enemies will
 I ll not come at them

 BOSOLA This proclaims your breeding
 Every small thing draws a base mind to fear
 As the adamant draws iron Fare you well sir
 You shall shortly hear from s
 Exit

 DUCHESS I suspect some ambush
 Therefore by all my love I do conjure you
 To take your eldest son and fly towards Milan
 Let us not venture all this poor remainder
 In one unlucky bottom

 ANTONIO You counsel safely
 Best of my life farewell Since we must part
 Heaven hath a hand in t but no otherwise
 Than as some curious artist takes in sunder
 A clock or watch when it is out of frame
 To bring t in better order

 DUCHESS I know not which is best
 To see you dead or part with youFarewell boy
 Thou art happy that thou hast not understanding
 To know thy misery for all our wit
 And reading brings us to a truer sense
 Of sorrowIn the eternal church sir
 I do hope we shall not part thus

 ANTONIO O be of comfort
 Make patience a noble fortitude
 And think not how unkindly we are usd
 Man like to cassia is provd best being bruisd

 DUCHESS Must I like to slaveborn Russian
 Account it praise to suffer tyranny
 And yet O heaven thy heavy hand is in t
 I have seen my little boy oft scourge his top
 And compard myself to t naught made me eer
 Go right but heavens scourgestick

 ANTONIO Do not weep
 Heaven fashiond us of nothing and we strive
 To bring ourselves to nothingFarewell Cariola
 And thy sweet armfulIf I do never see thee more
 Be a good mother to your little ones
 And save them from the tiger fare you well

 DUCHESS Let me look upon you once more for that speech
 Came from a dying father Your kiss is colder
 Than that I have seen an holy anchorite
 Give to a dead mans skull

 ANTONIO My heart is turnd to a heavy lump of lead
 With which I sound my danger fare you well
 Exeunt ANTONIO and his son

 DUCHESS My laurel is all withered

 CARIOLA Look madam what a troop of armed men
 Make toward us

 Reenter BOSOLA visarded with a Guard

 DUCHESS O they are very welcome
 When Fortunes wheel is overchargd with princes
 The weight makes it move swift I would have my ruin
 Be suddenI am your adventure am I not

 BOSOLA You are you must see your husband no more

 DUCHESS What devil art thou that counterfeitst heavens thunder

 BOSOLA Is that terrible I would have you tell me whether
 Is that note worse that frights the silly birds
 Out of the corn or that which doth allure them
 To the nets You have hearkned to the last too much

 DUCHESS O misery like to a rusty oerchargd cannon
 Shall I never fly in piecesCome to what prison

 BOSOLA To none

 DUCHESS Whither then

 BOSOLA To your palace

 DUCHESS I have heard
 That Charons boat serves to convey all oer
 The dismal lake but brings none back again

 BOSOLA Your brothers mean you safety and pity

 DUCHESS Pity
 With such a pity men preserve alive
 Pheasants and quails when they are not fat enough
 To be eaten

 BOSOLA These are your children

 DUCHESS Yes

 BOSOLA Can they prattle

 DUCHESS No
 But I intend since they were born accursd
 Curses shall be their first language

 BOSOLA Fie madam
 Forget this base low fellow

 DUCHESS Were I a man
 I d beat that counterfeit face97 into thy other

 BOSOLA One of no birth

 DUCHESS Say that he was born mean
 Man is most happy when s own actions
 Be arguments and examples of his virtue

 BOSOLA A barren beggarly virtue

 DUCHESS I prithee who is greatest Can you tell
 Sad tales befit my woe I ll tell you one
 A salmon as she swam unto the sea
 Met with a dogfish who encounters her
 With this rough language Why art thou so bold
 To mix thyself with our high state of floods
 Being no eminent courtier but one
 That for the calmest and fresh time o th year
 Dost live in shallow rivers rankst thyself
 With silly smelts and shrimps And darest thou
 Pass by our dogship without reverence
 O quoth the salmon sister be at peace
 Thank Jupiter we both have passd the net
 Our value never can be truly known
 Till in the fishers basket we be shown
 I th market then my price may be the higher
 Even when I am nearest to the cook and fire
 So to great men the moral may be stretched
 Men oft are valud high when theyre most wretched
 But come whither you please I am armd gainst misery
 Bent to all sways of the oppressors will
 There s no deep valley but near some great hill
 Exeunt



 Act IV


 Scene I98

 Enter FERDINAND and BOSOLA

 FERDINAND How doth our sister duchess bear herself
 In her imprisonment

 BOSOLA Nobly I ll describe her
 She s sad as one long usd to t and she seems
 Rather to welcome the end of misery
 Than shun it a behaviour so noble
 As gives a majesty to adversity
 You may discern the shape of loveliness
 More perfect in her tears than in her smiles
 She will muse for hours together and her silence
 Methinks expresseth more than if she spake

 FERDINAND Her melancholy seems to be fortified
 With a strange disdain

 BOSOLA Tis so and this restraint
 Like English mastives that grow fierce with tying
 Makes her too passionately apprehend
 Those pleasures she is kept from

 FERDINAND Curse upon her
 I will no longer study in the book
 Of anothers heart Inform her what I told you
 Exit

 Enter DUCHESS and Attendants

 BOSOLA All comfort to your grace

 DUCHESS I will have none
 Pray thee why dost thou wrap thy poisond pills
 In gold and sugar

 BOSOLA Your elder brother the Lord Ferdinand
 Is come to visit you and sends you word
 Cause once he rashly made a solemn vow
 Never to see you more he comes i th night
 And prays you gently neither torch nor taper
 Shine in your chamber He will kiss your hand
 And reconcile himself but for his vow
 He dares not see you

 DUCHESS At his pleasure
 Take hence the lightsHe s come
 Exeunt Attendants with lights

 Enter FERDINAND

 FERDINAND Where are you

 DUCHESS Here sir

 FERDINAND This darkness suits you well

 DUCHESS I would ask you pardon

 FERDINAND You have it
 For I account it the honorablst revenge
 Where I may kill to pardonWhere are your cubs

 DUCHESS Whom

 FERDINAND Call them your children
 For though our national law distinguish bastards
 From true legitimate issue compassionate nature
 Makes them all equal

 DUCHESS Do you visit me for this
 You violate a sacrament o th church
 Shall make you howl in hell for t

 FERDINAND It had been well
 Could you have livd thus always for indeed
 You were too much i th lightbut no more
 I come to seal my peace with you Here s a hand
 Gives her a dead mans hand
 To which you have vowd much love the ring upon t
 You gave

 DUCHESS I affectionately kiss it

 FERDINAND Pray do and bury the print of it in your heart
 I will leave this ring with you for a lovetoken
 And the hand as sure as the ring and do not doubt
 But you shall have the heart too When you need a friend
 Send it to him that owd it you shall see
 Whether he can aid you

 DUCHESS You are very cold
 I fear you are not well after your travel
 Ha lightsO horrible

 FERDINAND Let her have lights enough
 Exit

 DUCHESS What witchcraft doth he practise that he hath left
 A dead mans hand here
 Here is discovered behind a traverse99 the artificial
 figures of ANTONIO and his children appearing as if
 they were dead

 BOSOLA Look you here s the piece from which twas taen
 He doth present you this sad spectacle
 That now you know directly they are dead
 Hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve
 For that which cannot be recovered

 DUCHESS There is not between heaven and earth one wish
 I stay for after this It wastes me more
 Than were t my picture fashiond out of wax
 Stuck with a magical needle and then buried
 In some foul dunghill and yon s an excellent property
 For a tyrant which I would account mercy

 BOSOLA What s that

 DUCHESS If they would bind me to that lifeless trunk
 And let me freeze to death

 BOSOLA Come you must live

 DUCHESS That s the greatest torture souls feel in hell
 In hell that they must live and cannot die
 Portia100 I ll new kindle thy coals again
 And revive the rare and almost dead example
 Of a loving wife

 BOSOLA O fie despair Remember
 You are a Christian

 DUCHESS The church enjoins fasting
 I ll starve myself to death

 BOSOLA Leave this vain sorrow
 Things being at the worst begin to mend the bee
 When he hath shot his sting into your hand
 May then play with your eyelid

 DUCHESS Good comfortable fellow
 Persuade a wretch that s broke upon the wheel
 To have all his bones new set entreat him live
 To be executed again Who must despatch me
 I account this world a tedious theatre
 For I do play a part in t gainst my will

 BOSOLA Come be of comfort I will save your life

 DUCHESS Indeed I have not leisure to tend so small a business

 BOSOLA Now by my life I pity you

 DUCHESS Thou art a fool then
 To waste thy pity on a thing so wretched
 As cannot pity itself I am full of daggers
 Puff let me blow these vipers from me
 Enter Servant
 What are you

 SERVANT One that wishes you long life

 DUCHESS I would thou wert hangd for the horrible curse
 Thou hast given me I shall shortly grow one
 Of the miracles of pity I ll go pray
 Exit Servant
 No I ll go curse

 BOSOLA O fie

 DUCHESS I could curse the stars

 BOSOLA O fearful

 DUCHESS And those three smiling seasons of the year
 Into a Russian winter nay the world
 To its first chaos

 BOSOLA Look you the stars shine still

 DUCHESS O but you must
 Remember my curse hath a great way to go
 Plagues that make lanes through largest families
 Consume them

 BOSOLA Fie lady

 DUCHESS Let them like tyrants
 Never be remembered but for the ill they have done
 Let all the zealous prayers of mortified
 Churchmen forget them

 BOSOLA O uncharitable

 DUCHESS Let heaven a little while cease crowning martyrs
 To punish them
 Go howl them this and say I long to bleed
 It is some mercy when men kill with speed
 Exit

 Reenter FERDINAND

 FERDINAND Excellent as I would wish she s plagud in art101
 These presentations are but framd in wax
 By the curious master in that quality102
 Vincentio Lauriola and she takes them
 For true substantial bodies

 BOSOLA Why do you do this

 FERDINAND To bring her to despair

 BOSOLA Faith end here
 And go no farther in your cruelty
 Send her a penitential garment to put on
 Next to her delicate skin and furnish her
 With beads and prayerbooks

 FERDINAND Damn her that body of hers
 While that my blood run pure in t was more worth
 Than that which thou wouldst comfort calld a soul
 I will send her masques of common courtezans
 Have her meat servd up by bawds and ruffians
 And cause she ll needs be mad I am resolvd
 To move forth the common hospital
 All the madfolk and place them near her lodging
 There let them practise together sing and dance
 And act their gambols to the full o th moon
 If she can sleep the better for it let her
 Your work is almost ended

 BOSOLA Must I see her again

 FERDINAND Yes

 BOSOLA Never

 FERDINAND You must

 BOSOLA Never in mine own shape
 That s forfeited by my intelligence103
 And this last cruel lie when you send me next
 The business shall be comfort

 FERDINAND Very likely
 Thy pity is nothing of kin to thee Antonio
 Lurks about Milan thou shalt shortly thither
 To feed a fire as great as my revenge
 Which nevr will slack till it hath spent his fuel
 Intemperate agues make physicians cruel
 Exeunt

 Scene II104

 Enter DUCHESS and CARIOLA

 DUCHESS What hideous noise was that

 CARIOLA Tis the wild consort105
 Of madmen lady which your tyrant brother
 Hath placd about your lodging This tyranny
 I think was never practisd till this hour

 DUCHESS Indeed I thank him Nothing but noise and folly
 Can keep me in my right wits whereas reason
 And silence make me stark mad Sit down
 Discourse to me some dismal tragedy

 CARIOLA O twill increase your melancholy

 DUCHESS Thou art deceivd
 To hear of greater grief would lessen mine
 This is a prison

 CARIOLA Yes but you shall live
 To shake this durance off

 DUCHESS Thou art a fool
 The robinredbreast and the nightingale
 Never live long in cages

 CARIOLA Pray dry your eyes
 What think you of madam

 DUCHESS Of nothing
 When I muse thus I sleep

 CARIOLA Like a madman with your eyes open

 DUCHESS Dost thou think we shall know one another
 In th other world

 CARIOLA Yes out of question

 DUCHESS O that it were possible we might
 But hold some two days conference with the dead
 From them I should learn somewhat I am sure
 I never shall know here I ll tell thee a miracle
 I am not mad yet to my cause of sorrow
 Th heaven oer my head seems made of molten brass
 The earth of flaming sulphur yet I am not mad
 I am acquainted with sad misery
 As the tannd galleyslave is with his oar
 Necessity makes me suffer constantly
 And custom makes it easy Who do I look like now

 CARIOLA Like to your picture in the gallery
 A deal of life in show but none in practice
 Or rather like some reverend monument
 Whose ruins are even pitied

 DUCHESS Very proper
 And Fortune seems only to have her eyesight
 To behold my tragedyHow now
 What noise is that

 Enter Servant

 SERVANT I am come to tell you
 Your brother hath intended you some sport
 A great physician when the Pope was sick
 Of a deep melancholy presented him
 With several sorts106 of madmen which wild object
 Being full of change and sport forcd him to laugh
 And so the imposthume107 broke the selfsame cure
 The duke intends on you

 DUCHESS Let them come in

 SERVANT There s a mad lawyer and a secular priest
 A doctor that hath forfeited his wits
 By jealousy an astrologian
 That in his works said such a day o the month
 Should be the day of doom and failing of t
 Ran mad an English tailor crazd i the brain
 With the study of new fashions a gentlemanusher
 Quite beside himself with care to keep in mind
 The number of his ladys salutations
 Or How do you she employd him in each morning
 A farmer too an excellent knave in grain108
 Mad cause he was hindred transportation109
 And let one broker that s mad loose to these
 Youd think the devil were among them

 DUCHESS Sit CariolaLet them loose when you please
 For I am chaind to endure all your tyranny

 Enter Madman

 Here by a Madman this song is sung to a dismal kind of music

 O let us howl some heavy note
 Some deadly dogged howl
 Sounding as from the threatening throat
 Of beasts and fatal fowl
 As ravens screechowls bulls and bears
 We ll bell and bawl our parts
 Till irksome noise have cloyd your ears
 And corrosivd your hearts
 At last whenas our choir wants breath
 Our bodies being blest
 We ll sing like swans to welcome death
 And die in love and rest

 DUCHESS Is he mad too

 SERVANT Pray question him I ll leave you
 Exeunt Servant and Madmen

 BOSOLA I am come to make thy tomb

 DUCHESS Ha my tomb
 Thou speakst as if I lay upon my deathbed
 Gasping for breath Dost thou perceive me sick

 BOSOLA
 Yes and the more dangerously since thy sickness is insensible

 DUCHESS Thou art not mad sure dost know me

 BOSOLA Yes

 DUCHESS Who am I

 BOSOLA Thou art a box of wormseed at best but a salvatory115
 of green mummy116 What s this flesh a little crudded117 milk
 fantastical puffpaste Our bodies are weaker than those paper
 prisons boys use to keep flies in more contemptible since ours
 is to preserve earthworms Didst thou ever see a lark in a cage
 Such is the soul in the body this world is like her little turf
 of grass and the heaven oer our heads like her lookingglass only
 gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison

 DUCHESS Am not I thy duchess

 BOSOLA Thou art some great woman sure for riot begins to sit
 on thy forehead clad in gray hairs twenty years sooner than on
 a merry milkmaids Thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be
 forced to take up her lodging in a cats ear a little infant that
 breeds its teeth should it lie with thee would cry out as if thou
 wert the more unquiet bedfellow

 DUCHESS I am Duchess of Malfi still

 BOSOLA That makes thy sleep so broken
 Glories like glowworms afar off shine bright
 But lookd to near have neither heat nor light

 DUCHESS Thou art very plain

 BOSOLA My trade is to flatter the dead not the living
 I am a tombmaker

 DUCHESS And thou comest to make my tomb

 BOSOLA Yes

 DUCHESS Let me be a little merryof what stuff wilt thou make it

 BOSOLA Nay resolve me first of what fashion

 DUCHESS Why do we grow fantastical on our deathbed
 Do we affect fashion in the grave

 BOSOLA Most ambitiously Princes images on their tombs do not
 lie as they were wont seeming to pray up to heaven but with their
 hands under their cheeks as if they died of the toothache They
 are not carved with their eyes fixd upon the stars but as their
 minds were wholly bent upon the world the selfsame way they seem
 to turn their faces

 DUCHESS Let me know fully therefore the effect
 Of this thy dismal preparation
 This talk fit for a charnel

 BOSOLA Now I shall
 Enter Executioners with a coffin cords and a bell
 Here is a present from your princely brothers
 And may it arrive welcome for it brings
 Last benefit last sorrow

 DUCHESS Let me see it
 I have so much obedience in my blood
 I wish it in their veins to do them good

 BOSOLA This is your last presencechamber

 CARIOLA O my sweet lady

 DUCHESS Peace it affrights not me

 BOSOLA I am the common bellman
 That usually is sent to condemnd persons
 The night before they suffer

 DUCHESS Even now thou saidst
 Thou wast a tombmaker

 BOSOLA Twas to bring you
 By degrees to mortification Listen

 Hark now everything is still
 The screechowl and the whistler shrill
 Call upon our dame aloud
 And bid her quickly don her shroud
 Much you had of land and rent
 Your length in clay s now competent
 A long war disturbd your mind
 Here your perfect peace is signd
 Of what is t fools make such vain keeping
 Sin their conception their birth weeping
 Their life a general mist of error
 Their death a hideous storm of terror
 Strew your hair with powders sweet
 Don clean linen bathe your feet
 And the foul fiend more to check
 A crucifix let bless your neck
 Tis now full tide tween night and day
 End your groan and come away

 CARIOLA Hence villains tyrants murderers Alas
 What will you do with my ladyCall for help

 DUCHESS To whom To our next neighbours They are madfolks

 BOSOLA Remove that noise

 DUCHESS Farewell Cariola
 In my last will I have not much to give
 A many hungry guests have fed upon me
 Thine will be a poor reversion

 CARIOLA I will die with her

 DUCHESS I pray thee look thou givst my little boy
 Some syrup for his cold and let the girl
 Say her prayers ere she sleep
 Cariola is forced out by the Executioners
 Now what you please
 What death

 BOSOLA Strangling here are your executioners

 DUCHESS I forgive them
 The apoplexy catarrh or cough o th lungs
 Would do as much as they do

 BOSOLA Doth not death fright you

 DUCHESS Who would be afraid on t
 Knowing to meet such excellent company
 In th other world

 BOSOLA Yet methinks
 The manner of your death should much afflict you
 This cord should terrify you

 DUCHESS Not a whit
 What would it pleasure me to have my throat cut
 With diamonds or to be smothered
 With cassia or to be shot to death with pearls
 I know death hath ten thousand several doors
 For men to take their exits and tis found
 They go on such strange geometrical hinges
 You may open them both ways any way for heavensake
 So I were out of your whispering Tell my brothers
 That I perceive death now I am well awake
 Best gift is they can give or I can take
 I would fain put off my last womansfault
 I d not be tedious to you

 FIRST EXECUTIONER We are ready

 DUCHESS Dispose my breath how please you but my body
 Bestow upon my women will you

 FIRST EXECUTIONER Yes

 DUCHESS Pull and pull strongly for your able strength
 Must pull down heaven upon me
 Yet stay heavengates are not so highly archd
 As princes palaces they that enter there
 Must go upon their knees KneelsCome violent death
 Serve for mandragora to make me sleep
 Go tell my brothers when I am laid out
 They then may feed in quiet
 They strangle her

 BOSOLA Where s the waitingwoman
 Fetch her some other strangle the children
 Enter CARIOLA
 Look you there sleeps your mistress

 CARIOLA O you are damnd
 Perpetually for this My turn is next
 Is t not so ordered

 BOSOLA Yes and I am glad
 You are so well prepard for t

 CARIOLA You are deceivd sir
 I am not prepard for t I will not die
 I will first come to my answer118 and know
 How I have offended

 BOSOLA Come despatch her
 You kept her counsel now you shall keep ours

 CARIOLA I will not die I must not I am contracted
 To a young gentleman

 FIRST EXECUTIONER Here s your weddingring

 CARIOLA Let me but speak with the duke I ll discover
 Treason to his person

 BOSOLA Delaysthrottle her

 FIRST EXECUTIONER She bites and scratches

 CARIOLA If you kill me now
 I am damnd I have not been at confession
 This two years

 BOSOLA To Executioners When119

 CARIOLA I am quick with child

 BOSOLA Why then
 Your credit s saved
 Executioners strangle Cariola
 Bear her into the next room
 Let these lie still
 Exeunt the Executioners with the body of CARIOLA

 Enter FERDINAND

 FERDINAND Is she dead

 BOSOLA She is what
 You d have her But here begin your pity
 Shows the Children strangled
 Alas how have these offended

 FERDINAND The death
 Of young wolves is never to be pitied

 BOSOLA Fix your eye here

 FERDINAND Constantly

 BOSOLA Do you not weep
 Other sins only speak murder shrieks out
 The element of water moistens the earth
 But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens

 FERDINAND Cover her face mine eyes dazzle she died young

 BOSOLA I think not so her infelicity
 Seemd to have years too many

 FERDINAND She and I were twins
 And should I die this instant I had livd
 Her time to a minute

 BOSOLA It seems she was born first
 You have bloodily approvd the ancient truth
 That kindred commonly do worse agree
 Than remote strangers

 FERDINAND Let me see her face
 Again Why didst thou not pity her What
 An excellent honest man mightst thou have been
 If thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary
 Or bold in a good cause opposd thyself
 With thy advanced sword above thy head
 Between her innocence and my revenge
 I bade thee when I was distracted of my wits
 Go kill my dearest friend and thou hast done t
 For let me but examine well the cause
 What was the meanness of her match to me
 Only I must confess I had a hope
 Had she continud widow to have gaind
 An infinite mass of treasure by her death
 And that was the main causeher marriage
 That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart
 For thee as we observe in tragedies
 That a good actor many times is cursd
 For playing a villains part I hate thee for t
 And for my sake say thou hast done much ill well

 BOSOLA Let me quicken your memory for I perceive
 You are falling into ingratitude I challenge
 The reward due to my service

 FERDINAND I ll tell thee
 What I ll give thee

 BOSOLA Do

 FERDINAND I ll give thee a pardon
 For this murder

 BOSOLA Ha

 FERDINAND Yes and tis
 The largest bounty I can study to do thee
 By what authority didst thou execute
 This bloody sentence

 BOSOLA By yours

 FERDINAND Mine was I her judge
 Did any ceremonial form of law
 Doom her to notbeing Did a complete jury
 Deliver her conviction up i the court
 Where shalt thou find this judgment registerd
 Unless in hell See like a bloody fool
 Thou st forfeited thy life and thou shalt die for t

 BOSOLA The office of justice is perverted quite
 When one thief hangs another Who shall dare
 To reveal this

 FERDINAND O I ll tell thee
 The wolf shall find her grave and scrape it up
 Not to devour the corpse but to discover
 The horrid murder

 BOSOLA You not I shall quake for t

 FERDINAND Leave me

 BOSOLA I will first receive my pension

 FERDINAND You are a villain

 BOSOLA When your ingratitude
 Is judge I am so

 FERDINAND O horror
 That not the fear of him which binds the devils
 Can prescribe man obedience
 Never look upon me more

 BOSOLA Why fare thee well
 Your brother and yourself are worthy men
 You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves
 Rotten and rotting others and your vengeance
 Like two chaindbullets still goes arm in arm
 You may be brothers for treason like the plague
 Doth take much in a blood I stand like one
 That long hath taen a sweet and golden dream
 I am angry with myself now that I wake

 FERDINAND Get thee into some unknown part o the world
 That I may never see thee

 BOSOLA Let me know
 Wherefore I should be thus neglected Sir
 I servd your tyranny and rather strove
 To satisfy yourself than all the world
 And though I loathd the evil yet I lovd
 You that did counsel it and rather sought
 To appear a true servant than an honest man

 FERDINAND I ll go hunt the badger by owllight
 Tis a deed of darkness
 Exit

 BOSOLA He s much distracted Off my painted honour
 While with vain hopes our faculties we tire
 We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire
 What would I do were this to do again
 I would not change my peace of conscience
 For all the wealth of EuropeShe stirs here s life
 Return fair soul from darkness and lead mine
 Out of this sensible hellshe s warm she breathes
 Upon thy pale lips I will melt my heart
 To store them with fresh colourWho s there
 Some cordial drinkAlas I dare not call
 So pity would destroy pityHer eye opes
 And heaven in it seems to ope that late was shut
 To take me up to mercy

 DUCHESS Antonio

 BOSOLA Yes madam he is living
 The dead bodies you saw were but feignd statues
 He s reconcild to your brothers the Pope hath wrought
 The atonement

 DUCHESS Mercy
 Dies

 BOSOLA O she s gone again there the cords of life broke
 O sacred innocence that sweetly sleeps
 On turtles feathers whilst a guilty conscience
 Is a black register wherein is writ
 All our good deeds and bad a perspective
 That shows us hell That we cannot be sufferd
 To do good when we have a mind to it
 This is manly sorrow
 These tears I am very certain never grew
 In my mothers milk My estate is sunk
 Below the degree of fear where were
 These penitent fountains while she was living
 O they were frozen up Here is a sight
 As direful to my soul as is the sword
 Unto a wretch hath slain his father
 Come I ll bear thee hence
 And execute thy last will that s deliver
 Thy body to the reverend dispose
 Of some good women that the cruel tyrant
 Shall not deny me Then I ll post to Milan
 Where somewhat I will speedily enact
 Worth my dejection
 Exit with the body



 Act V


 Scene I120

 Enter ANTONIO and DELIO

 ANTONIO What think you of my hope of reconcilement
 To the Arragonian brethren

 DELIO I misdoubt it
 For though they have sent their letters of safeconduct
 For your repair to Milan they appear
 But nets to entrap you The Marquis of Pescara
 Under whom you hold certain land in cheat121
 Much gainst his noble nature hath been movd
 To seize those lands and some of his dependants
 Are at this instant making it their suit
 To be invested in your revenues
 I cannot think they mean well to your life
 That do deprive you of your means of life
 Your living

 ANTONIO You are still an heretic122
 To any safety I can shape myself

 DELIO Here comes the marquis I will make myself
 Petitioner for some part of your land
 To know whither it is flying

 ANTONIO I pray do
 Withdraws

 Enter PESCARA
 DELIO Sir I have a suit to you

 PESCARA To me

 DELIO An easy one
 There is the Citadel of Saint Bennet
 With some demesnes of late in the possession
 Of Antonio Bolognaplease you bestow them on me

 PESCARA You are my friend but this is such a suit
 Nor fit for me to give nor you to take

 DELIO No sir

 PESCARA I will give you ample reason for t
 Soon in privatehere s the cardinals mistress

 Enter JULIA

 JULIA My lord I am grown your poor petitioner
 And should be an ill beggar had I not
 A great mans letter here the cardinals
 To court you in my favour
 Gives a letter

 PESCARA He entreats for you
 The Citadel of Saint Bennet that belongd
 To the banishd Bologna

 JULIA Yes

 PESCARA I could not have thought of a friend I could rather
 Pleasure with it tis yours

 JULIA Sir I thank you
 And he shall know how doubly I am engagd
 Both in your gift and speediness of giving
 Which makes your grant the greater
 Exit

 ANTONIO How they fortify
 Themselves with my ruin

 DELIO Sir I am
 Little bound to you

 PESCARA Why

 DELIO Because you denid this suit to me and gave t
 To such a creature

 PESCARA Do you know what it was
 It was Antonios land not forfeited
 By course of law but ravishd from his throat
 By the cardinals entreaty It were not fit
 I should bestow so main a piece of wrong
 Upon my friend tis a gratification
 Only due to a strumpet for it is injustice
 Shall I sprinkle the pure blood of innocents
 To make those followers I call my friends
 Look ruddier upon me I am glad
 This land taen from the owner by such wrong
 Returns again unto so foul an use
 As salary for his lust Learn good Delio
 To ask noble things of me and you shall find
 I ll be a noble giver

 DELIO You instruct me well

 ANTONIO Why here s a man now would fright impudence
 From sauciest beggars

 PESCARA Prince Ferdinand s come to Milan
 Sick as they give out of an apoplexy
 But some say tis a frenzy I am going
 To visit him
 Exit

 ANTONIO Tis a noble old fellow

 DELIO What course do you mean to take Antonio

 ANTONIO This night I mean to venture all my fortune
 Which is no more than a poor lingring life
 To the cardinals worst of malice I have got
 Private access to his chamber and intend
 To visit him about the mid of night
 As once his brother did our noble duchess
 It may be that the sudden apprehension
 Of dangerfor I ll go in mine own shape
 When he shall see it fraight123 with love and duty
 May draw the poison out of him and work
 A friendly reconcilement If it fail
 Yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling
 For better fall once than be ever falling

 DELIO I ll second you in all danger and howeer
 My life keeps rank with yours

 ANTONIO You are still my lovd and best friend
 Exeunt


 Scene II124

 Enter PESCARA and DOCTOR

 PESCARA Now doctor may I visit your patient

 DOCTOR If t please your lordship but he s instantly
 To take the air here in the gallery
 By my direction

 PESCARA Pray thee what s his disease

 DOCTOR A very pestilent disease my lord
 They call lycanthropia

 PESCARA What s that
 I need a dictionary to t

 DOCTOR I ll tell you
 In those that are possessd with t there oerflows
 Such melancholy humour they imagine
 Themselves to be transformed into wolves
 Steal forth to churchyards in the dead of night
 And dig dead bodies up as two nights since
 One met the duke bout midnight in a lane
 Behind Saint Marks church with the leg of a man
 Upon his shoulder and he howld fearfully
 Said he was a wolf only the difference
 Was a wolfs skin was hairy on the outside
 His on the inside bade them take their swords
 Rip up his flesh and try Straight I was sent for
 And having ministerd to him found his grace
 Very well recoverd

 PESCARA I am glad on t

 DOCTOR Yet not without some fear
 Of a relapse If he grow to his fit again
 I ll go a nearer way to work with him
 Than ever Paracelsus dreamd of if
 They ll give me leave I ll buffet his madness out of him
 Stand aside he comes

 Enter FERDINAND CARDINAL MALATESTI and BOSOLA

 FERDINAND Leave me

 MALATESTI Why doth your lordship love this solitariness

 FERDINAND Eagles commonly fly alone they are crows daws
 and starlings that flock together Look what s that follows me

 MALATESTI Nothing my lord

 FERDINAND Yes

 MALATESTI Tis your shadow

 FERDINAND Stay it let it not haunt me

 MALATESTI Impossible if you move and the sun shine

 FERDINAND I will throttle it
 Throws himself down on his shadow

 MALATESTI O my lord you are angry with nothing

 FERDINAND You are a fool how is t possible I should catch
 my shadow unless I fall upon t When I go to hell I mean
 to carry a bribe for look you good gifts evermore make way
 for the worst persons

 PESCARA Rise good my lord

 FERDINAND I am studying the art of patience

 PESCARA Tis a noble virtue

 FERDINAND To drive six snails before me from this town to Moscow
 neither use goad nor whip to them but let them take their own time
 the patientst man i th world match me for an experiment
 an I ll crawl after like a sheepbiter125

 CARDINAL Force him up
 They raise him

 FERDINAND Use me well you were best What I have done I have

 PESCARA Your doctor

 DOCTOR I must do mad tricks with him for that s the only way
 on tI have brought your grace a salamanders skin to keep
 you from sunburning

 FERDINAND I have cruel sore eyes

 DOCTOR The white of a cockatrixs126 egg is present remedy

 FERDINAND Let it be a newlaid one you were best
 Hide me from him physicians are like kings
 They brook no contradiction

 DOCTOR Now he begins to fear me now let me alone with him

 CARDINAL How now put off your gown

 DOCTOR Let me have some forty urinals filled with rosewater

 as tame as a dormouse

 FERDINAND Can you fetch your frisks sirI will stamp him into
 a cullis128 flay off his skin to cover one of the anatomies129
 this rogue hath set i th cold yonder in BarberChirurgeonshall
 Hence hence you are all of you like beasts for sacrifice
 Throws the DOCTOR down and beats him
 There s nothing left of you but tongue and belly flattery and
 lechery
 Exit

 PESCARA Doctor he did not fear you thoroughly

 DOCTOR True I was somewhat too forward

 BOSOLA Mercy upon me what a fatal judgment
 Hath falln upon this Ferdinand

 PESCARA Knows your grace
 What accident hath brought unto the prince
 This strange distraction

 CARDINAL Aside I must feign somewhatThus they say it grew
 You have heard it rumourd for these many years
 None of our family dies but there is seen
 The shape of an old woman which is given
 By tradition to us to have been murderd
 By her nephews for her riches Such a figure
 One night as the prince sat up late at s book
 Appeard to him when crying out for help
 The gentleman of s chamber found his grace
 All on a cold sweat alterd much in face
 And language since which apparition
 He hath grown worse and worse and I much fear
 He cannot live

 BOSOLA Sir I would speak with you

 PESCARA We ll leave your grace
 Wishing to the sick prince our noble lord
 All health of mind and body

 CARDINAL You are most welcome
 Exeunt PESCARA MALATESTI and DOCTOR
 Are you come soAside This fellow must not know
 By any means I had intelligence
 In our duchess death for though I counselld it
 The full of all th engagement seemd to grow
 From FerdinandNow sir how fares our sister
 I do not think but sorrow makes her look
 Like to an oftdyd garment she shall now
 Take comfort from me Why do you look so wildly
 O the fortune of your master here the prince
 Dejects you but be you of happy comfort
 If you ll do one thing for me I ll entreat
 Though he had a cold tombstone oer his bones
 I d make you what you would be

 BOSOLA Any thing
 Give it me in a breath and let me fly to t
 They that think long small expedition win
 For musing much o th end cannot begin

 Enter JULIA

 JULIA Sir will you come into supper

 CARDINAL I am busy leave me

 JULIA Aside What an excellent shape hath that fellow
 Exit

 CARDINAL Tis thus Antonio lurks here in Milan
 Inquire him out and kill him While he lives
 Our sister cannot marry and I have thought
 Of an excellent match for her Do this and style me
 Thy advancement

 BOSOLA But by what means shall I find him out

 CARDINAL There is a gentleman calld Delio
 Here in the camp that hath been long approvd
 His loyal friend Set eye upon that fellow
 Follow him to mass may be Antonio
 Although he do account religion
 But a schoolname for fashion of the world
 May accompany him or else go inquire out
 Delios confessor and see if you can bribe
 Him to reveal it There are a thousand ways
 A man might find to trace him as to know
 What fellows haunt the Jews for taking up
 Great sums of money for sure he s in want
 Or else to go to the picturemakers and learn
 Who bought130 her picture lately some of these
 Happily may take

 BOSOLA Well I ll not freeze i th business
 I would see that wretched thing Antonio
 Above all sights i th world

 CARDINAL Do and be happy
 Exit

 BOSOLA This fellow doth breed basilisks in s eyes
 He s nothing else but murder yet he seems
 Not to have notice of the duchess death
 Tis his cunning I must follow his example
 There cannot be a surer way to trace
 Than that of an old fox

 Reenter JULIA with a pistol

 JULIA So sir you are well met

 BOSOLA How Now

 JULIA Nay the doors are fast enough
 Now sir I will make you confess your treachery

 BOSOLA Treachery

 JULIA Yes confess to me
 Which of my women twas you hird to put
 Lovepowder into my drink

 BOSOLA Lovepowder

 JULIA Yes when I was at Malfi
 Why should I fall in love with such a face else
 I have already sufferd for thee so much pain
 The only remedy to do me good
 Is to kill my longing

 BOSOLA Sure your pistol holds
 Nothing but perfumes or kissingcomfits131
 Excellent lady
 You have a pretty way on t to discover
 Your longing Come come I ll disarm you
 And arm you thus yet this is wondrous strange

 JULIA Compare thy form and my eyes together
 You ll find my love no such great miracle
 Now you ll say
 I am wanton this nice modesty in ladies
 Is but a troublesome familiar
 That haunts them

 BOSOLA Know you me I am a blunt soldier

 JULIA The better
 Sure there wants fire where there are no lively sparks
 Of roughness

 BOSOLA And I want compliment

 JULIA Why ignorance
 In courtship cannot make you do amiss
 If you have a heart to do well

 BOSOLA You are very fair

 JULIA Nay if you lay beauty to my charge
 I must plead unguilty

 BOSOLA Your bright eyes
 Carry a quiver of darts in them sharper
 Than sunbeams

 JULIA You will mar me with commendation
 Put yourself to the charge of courting me
 Whereas now I woo you

 BOSOLA Aside I have it I will work upon this creature
 Let us grow most amorously familiar
 If the great cardinal now should see me thus
 Would he not count me a villain

 JULIA No he might count me a wanton
 Not lay a scruple of offence on you
 For if I see and steal a diamond
 The fault is not i th stone but in me the thief
 That purloins it I am sudden with you
 We that are great women of pleasure use to cut off
 These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings
 And in an instant join the sweet delight
 And the pretty excuse together Had you been i th street
 Under my chamberwindow even there
 I should have courted you

 BOSOLA O you are an excellent lady

 JULIA Bid me do somewhat for you presently
 To express I love you

 BOSOLA I will and if you love me
 Fail not to effect it
 The cardinal is grown wondrous melancholy
 Demand the cause let him not put you off
 With feignd excuse discover the main ground on t

 JULIA Why would you know this

 BOSOLA I have depended on him
 And I hear that he is falln in some disgrace
 With the emperor if he be like the mice
 That forsake falling houses I would shift
 To other dependance

 JULIA You shall not need
 Follow the wars I ll be your maintenance

 BOSOLA And I your loyal servant but I cannot
 Leave my calling

 JULIA Not leave an ungrateful
 General for the love of a sweet lady
 You are like some cannot sleep in featherbeds
 But must have blocks for their pillows

 BOSOLA Will you do this

 JULIA Cunningly

 BOSOLA Tomorrow I ll expect th intelligence

 JULIA Tomorrow get you into my cabinet
 You shall have it with you Do not delay me
 No more than I do you I am like one
 That is condemnd I have my pardon promisd
 But I would see it seald Go get you in
 You shall see my wind my tongue about his heart
 Like a skein of silk
 Exit BOSOLA

 Reenter CARDINAL

 CARDINAL Where are you

 Enter Servants

 SERVANTS Here

 CARDINAL Let none upon your lives have conference
 With the Prince Ferdinand unless I know it
 Aside In this distraction he may reveal
 The murder
 Exeunt Servants
 Yond s my lingering consumption
 I am weary of her and by any means
 Would be quit of

 JULIA How now my lord what ails you

 CARDINAL Nothing

 JULIA O you are much alterd
 Come I must be your secretary and remove
 This lead from off your bosom what s the matter

 CARDINAL I may not tell you

 JULIA Are you so far in love with sorrow
 You cannot part with part of it Or think you
 I cannot love your grace when you are sad
 As well as merry Or do you suspect
 I that have been a secret to your heart
 These many winters cannot be the same
 Unto your tongue

 CARDINAL Satisfy thy longing
 The only way to make thee keep my counsel
 Is not to tell thee

 JULIA Tell your echo this
 Or flatterers that like echoes still report
 What they hear though most imperfect and not me
 For if that you be true unto yourself
 I ll know

 CARDINAL Will you rack me

 JULIA No judgment shall
 Draw it from you it is an equal fault
 To tell ones secrets unto all or none

 CARDINAL The first argues folly

 JULIA But the last tyranny

 CARDINAL Very well why imagine I have committed
 Some secret deed which I desire the world
 May never hear of

 JULIA Therefore may not I know it
 You have conceald for me as great a sin
 As adultery Sir never was occasion
 For perfect trial of my constancy
 Till now sir I beseech you

 CARDINAL You ll repent it

 JULIA Never

 CARDINAL It hurries thee to ruin I ll not tell thee
 Be well advisd and think what danger tis
 To receive a princes secrets They that do
 Had need have their breasts hoopd with adamant
 To contain them I pray thee yet be satisfid
 Examine thine own frailty tis more easy
 To tie knots than unloose them Tis a secret
 That like a lingring poison may chance lie
 Spread in thy veins and kill thee seven year hence

 JULIA Now you dally with me

 CARDINAL No more thou shalt know it
 By my appointment the great Duchess of Malfi
 And two of her young children four nights since
 Were strangld

 JULIA O heaven sir what have you done

 CARDINAL How now How settles this Think you your bosom
 Will be a grave dark and obscure enough
 For such a secret

 JULIA You have undone yourself sir

 CARDINAL Why

 JULIA It lies not in me to conceal it

 CARDINAL No
 Come I will swear you to t upon this book

 JULIA Most religiously

 CARDINAL Kiss it
 She kisses the book
 Now you shall never utter it thy curiosity
 Hath undone thee thou rt poisond with that book
 Because I knew thou couldst not keep my counsel
 I have bound thee to t by death

 Reenter BOSOLA

 BOSOLA For pitysake hold

 CARDINAL Ha Bosola

 JULIA I forgive you
 This equal piece of justice you have done
 For I betrayd your counsel to that fellow
 He overheard it that was the cause I said
 It lay not in me to conceal it

 BOSOLA O foolish woman
 Couldst not thou have poisond him

 JULIA Tis weakness
 Too much to think what should have been done I go
 I know not whither
 Dies

 CARDINAL Wherefore comst thou hither

 BOSOLA That I might find a great man like yourself
 Not out of his wits as the Lord Ferdinand
 To remember my service

 CARDINAL I ll have thee hewd in pieces

 BOSOLA Make not yourself such a promise of that life
 Which is not yours to dispose of

 CARDINAL Who placd thee here

 BOSOLA Her lust as she intended

 CARDINAL Very well
 Now you know me for your fellowmurderer

 BOSOLA And wherefore should you lay fair marble colours
 Upon your rotten purposes to me
 Unless you imitate some that do plot great treasons
 And when they have done go hide themselves i th grave
 Of those were actors in t

 CARDINAL No more there is
 A fortune attends thee

 BOSOLA Shall I go sue to Fortune any longer
 Tis the fools pilgrimage

 CARDINAL I have honours in store for thee

 BOSOLA There are a many ways that conduct to seeming
 Honour and some of them very dirty ones

 CARDINAL Throw to the devil
 Thy melancholy The fire burns well
 What need we keep a stirring of t and make
 A greater smother132 Thou wilt kill Antonio

 BOSOLA Yes

 CARDINAL Take up that body

 BOSOLA I think I shall
 Shortly grow the common bier for churchyards

 CARDINAL I will allow thee some dozen of attendants
 To aid thee in the murder

 BOSOLA O by no means Physicians that apply horseleeches
 to any rank swelling use to cut off their tails that the blood
 may run through them the faster let me have no train when I go
 to shed blood less it make me have a greater when I ride
 to the gallows

 CARDINAL Come to me after midnight to help to remove
 That body to her own lodging I ll give out
 She died o th plague twill breed the less inquiry
 After her death

 BOSOLA Where s Castruccio her husband

 CARDINAL He s rode to Naples to take possession
 Of Antonios citadel

 BOSOLA Believe me you have done a very happy turn

 CARDINAL Fail not to come There is the masterkey
 Of our lodgings and by that you may conceive
 What trust I plant in you

 BOSOLA You shall find me ready
 Exit CARDINAL
 O poor Antonio though nothing be so needful
 To thy estate as pity yet I find
 Nothing so dangerous I must look to my footing
 In such slippery icepavements men had need
 To be frostnaild well they may break their necks else
 The precedent s here afore me How this man
 Bears up in blood seems fearless Why tis well
 Security some men call the suburbs of hell
 Only a dead wall between Well good Antonio
 I ll seek thee out and all my care shall be
 To put thee into safety from the reach
 Of these most cruel biters that have got
 Some of thy blood already It may be
 I ll join with thee in a most just revenge
 The weakest arm is strong enough that strikes
 With the sword of justice Still methinks the duchess
 Haunts me there thereTis nothing but my melancholy
 O Penitence let me truly taste thy cup
 That throws men down only to raise them up
 Exit


 Scene III133

 Enter ANTONIO and DELIO Echo from the DUCHESSS Grave

 DELIO Yond s the cardinals window This fortification
 Grew from the ruins of an ancient abbey
 And to yond side o th river lies a wall
 Piece of a cloister which in my opinion
 Gives the best echo that you ever heard
 So hollow and so dismal and withal
 So plain in the distinction of our words
 That many have supposd it is a spirit
 That answers

 ANTONIO I do love these ancient ruins
 We never tread upon them but we set
 Our foot upon some reverend history
 And questionless here in this open court
 Which now lies naked to the injuries
 Of stormy weather some men lie interrd
 Lovd the church so well and gave so largely to t
 They thought it should have canopied their bones
 Till doomsday But all things have their end
 Churches and cities which have diseases like to men
 Must have like death that we have

 ECHO Like death that we have

 DELIO Now the echo hath caught you

 ANTONIO It groand methought and gave
 A very deadly accent

 ECHO Deadly accent

 DELIO I told you twas a pretty one You may make it
 A huntsman or a falconer a musician
 Or a thing of sorrow

 ECHO A thing of sorrow

 ANTONIO Ay sure that suits it best

 ECHO That suits it best

 ANTONIO Tis very like my wifes voice

 ECHO Ay wifes voice

 DELIO Come let us walk further from t
 I would not have you go to the cardinals tonight
 Do not

 ECHO Do not

 DELIO Wisdom doth not more moderate wasting sorrow
 Than time Take time for t be mindful of thy safety

 ECHO Be mindful of thy safety

 ANTONIO Necessity compels me
 Make scrutiny through the passages
 Of your own life you ll find it impossible
 To fly your fate

 ECHO O fly your fate

 DELIO Hark the dead stones seem to have pity on you
 And give you good counsel

 ANTONIO Echo I will not talk with thee
 For thou art a dead thing

 ECHO Thou art a dead thing

 ANTONIO My duchess is asleep now
 And her little ones I hope sweetly O heaven
 Shall I never see her more

 ECHO Never see her more

 ANTONIO I markd not one repetition of the echo
 But that and on the sudden a clear light
 Presented me a face folded in sorrow

 DELIO Your fancy merely

 ANTONIO Come I ll be out of this ague
 For to live thus is not indeed to live
 It is a mockery and abuse of life
 I will not henceforth save myself by halves
 Lose all or nothing

 DELIO Your own virtue save you
 I ll fetch your eldest son and second you
 It may be that the sight of his own blood
 Spread in so sweet a figure may beget
 The more compassion However fare you well
 Though in our miseries Fortune have a part
 Yet in our noble sufferings she hath none
 Contempt of pain that we may call our own
 Exeunt


 Scene IV134

 Enter CARDINAL PESCARA MALATESTI RODERIGO and GRISOLAN

 CARDINAL You shall not watch tonight by the sick prince
 His grace is very well recoverd

 MALATESTI Good my lord suffer us

 CARDINAL O by no means
 The noise and change of object in his eye
 Doth more distract him I pray all to bed
 And though you hear him in his violent fit
 Do not rise I entreat you

 PESCARA So sir we shall not

 CARDINAL Nay I must have you promise
 Upon your honours for I was enjoind to t
 By himself and he seemd to urge it sensibly

 PESCARA Let our honours bind this trifle

 CARDINAL Nor any of your followers

 MALATESTI Neither

 CARDINAL It may be to make trial of your promise
 When he s asleep myself will rise and feign
 Some of his mad tricks and cry out for help
 And feign myself in danger

 MALATESTI If your throat were cutting
 I d not come at you now I have protested against it

 CARDINAL Why I thank you

 GRISOLAN Twas a foul storm tonight

 RODERIGO The Lord Ferdinands chamber shook like an osier

 MALATESTI Twas nothing put pure kindness in the devil
 To rock his own child
 Exeunt all except the CARDINAL

 CARDINAL The reason why I would not suffer these
 About my brother is because at midnight
 I may with better privacy convey
 Julias body to her own lodging O my conscience
 I would pray now but the devil takes away my heart
 For having any confidence in prayer
 About this hour I appointed Bosola
 To fetch the body When he hath servd my turn
 He dies
 Exit

 Enter BOSOLA

 BOSOLA Ha twas the cardinals voice I heard him name
 Bosola and my death Listen I hear ones footing

 Enter FERDINAND

 FERDINAND Strangling is a very quiet death

 BOSOLA Aside Nay then I see I must stand upon my guard

 FERDINAND What say to that Whisper softly do you agree to t
 So it must be done i th dark the cardinal would not for
 a thousand pounds the doctor should see it
 Exit

 BOSOLA My death is plotted here s the consequence of murder
 We value not desert nor Christian breath
 When we know black deeds must be curd with death

 Enter ANTONIO and Servant

 SERVANT Here stay sir and be confident I pray
 I ll fetch you a dark lantern
 Exit

 ANTONIO Could I take him at his prayers
 There were hope of pardon

 BOSOLA Fall right my sword
 Stabs him
 I ll not give thee so much leisure as to pray

 ANTONIO O I am gone Thou hast ended a long suit
 In a minute

 BOSOLA What art thou

 ANTONIO A most wretched thing
 That only have thy benefit in death
 To appear myself

 Reenter Servant with a lantern

 SERVANT Where are you sir

 ANTONIO Very near my homeBosola

 SERVANT O misfortune

 BOSOLA Smother thy pity thou art dead elseAntonio
 The man I would have savd bove mine own life
 We are merely the stars tennisballs struck and banded
 Which way please themO good Antonio
 I ll whisper one thing in thy dying ear
 Shall make thy heart break quickly Thy fair duchess
 And two sweet children

 ANTONIO Their very names
 Kindle a little life in me

 BOSOLA Are murderd

 ANTONIO Some men have wishd to die
 At the hearing of sad tidings I am glad
 That I shall do t in sadness135 I would not now
 Wish my wounds balmd nor heald for I have no use
 To put my life to In all our quest of greatness
 Like wanton boys whose pastime is their care
 We follow after bubbles blown in th air
 Pleasure of life what is t Only the good hours
 Of an ague merely a preparative to rest
 To endure vexation I do not ask
 The process of my death only commend me
 To Delio

 BOSOLA Break heart

 ANTONIO And let my son fly the courts to princes
 Dies

 BOSOLA Thou seemst to have lovd Antonio

 SERVANT I brought him hither
 To have reconcild him to the cardinal

 BOSOLA I do not ask thee that
 Take him up if thou tender thine own life
 And bear him where the lady Julia
 Was wont to lodgeO my fate moves swift
 I have this cardinal in the forge already
 Now I ll bring him to th hammer O direful misprision136
 I will not imitate things glorious
 No more than base I ll be mine own example
 On on and look thou represent for silence
 The thing thou bearst137
 Exeunt


 Scene V138

 Enter CARDINAL with a book

 CARDINAL I am puzzld in a question about hell
 He says in hell there s one material fire
 And yet it shall not burn all men alike
 Lay him by How tedious is a guilty conscience
 When I look into the fishponds in my garden
 Methinks I see a thing armd with a rake
 That seems to strike at me
 Enter BOSOLA and Servant bearing ANTONIOS body
 Now art thou come
 Thou lookst ghastly
 There sits in thy face some great determination
 Mixd with some fear

 BOSOLA Thus it lightens into action
 I am come to kill thee

 CARDINAL HaHelp our guard

 BOSOLA Thou art deceivd they are out of thy howling

 CARDINAL Hold and I will faithfully divide
 Revenues with thee

 BOSOLA Thy prayers and proffers
 Are both unseasonable

 CARDINAL Raise the watch
 We are betrayd

 BOSOLA I have confind your flight
 I ll suffer your retreat to Julias chamber
 But no further

 CARDINAL Help we are betrayd

 Enter above PESCARA MALATESTI RODERIGO and GRISOLAN

 MALATESTI Listen

 CARDINAL My dukedom for rescue

 RODERIGO Fie upon his counterfeiting

 MALATESTI Why tis not the cardinal

 RODERIGO Yes yes tis he
 But I ll see him hangd ere I ll go down to him

 CARDINAL Here s a plot upon me I am assaulted I am lost
 Unless some rescue

 GRISOLAN He doth this pretty well
 But it will not serve to laugh me out of mine honour

 CARDINAL The swords at my throat

 RODERIGO You would not bawl so loud then

 MALATESTI
 Come come let s go to bed he told us this much aforehand

 PESCARA He wishd you should not come at him but believe t
 The accent of the voice sounds not in jest
 I ll down to him howsoever and with engines
 Force ope the doors
 Exit above

 RODERIGO Let s follow him aloof
 And note how the cardinal will laugh at him
 Exeunt above MALATESTI RODERIGO and GRISOLAN

 BOSOLA There s for you first
 Cause you shall not unbarricade the door
 To let in rescue
 Kills the Servant

 CARDINAL What cause hast thou to pursue my life

 BOSOLA Look there

 CARDINAL Antonio

 BOSOLA Slain by my hand unwittingly
 Pray and be sudden When thou killdst thy sister
 Thou tookst from Justice her most equal balance
 And left her naught but her sword

 CARDINAL O mercy

 BOSOLA Now it seems thy greatness was only outward
 For thou fallst faster of thyself than calamity
 Can drive thee I ll not waste longer time there
 Stabs him

 CARDINAL Thou hast hurt me

 BOSOLA Again

 CARDINAL Shall I die like a leveret
 Without any resistanceHelp help help
 I am slain

 Enter FERDINAND

 FERDINAND Th alarum Give me a fresh horse
 Rally the vauntguard or the day is lost
 Yield yield I give you the honour of arms
 Shake my sword over you will you yield

 CARDINAL Help me I am your brother

 FERDINAND The devil
 My brother fight upon the adverse party
 He wounds the CARDINAL and in the scuffle gives BOSOLA
 his deathwound
 There flies your ransom

 CARDINAL O justice
 I suffer now for what hath former bin
 Sorrow is held the eldest child of sin

 FERDINAND Now you re brave fellows Caesars fortune was harder
 than Pompeys Caesar died in the arms of prosperity Pompey at the
 feet of disgrace You both died in the field The pain s nothing
 pain many times is taken away with the apprehension of greater
 as the toothache with the sight of a barber that comes to pull
 it out There s philosophy for you

 BOSOLA Now my revenge is perfectSink thou main cause
 Kills FERDINAND
 Of my undoingThe last part of my life
 Hath done me best service

 FERDINAND Give me some wet hay I am brokenwinded
 I do account this world but a dogkennel
 I will vault credit and affect high pleasures
 Beyond death

 BOSOLA He seems to come to himself
 Now he s so near the bottom

 FERDINAND My sister O my sister there s the cause on t
 Whether we fall by ambition blood or lust
 Like diamonds we are cut with our own dust
 Dies

 CARDINAL Thou hast thy payment too

 BOSOLA Yes I hold my weary soul in my teeth
 Tis ready to part from me I do glory
 That thou which stoodst like a huge pyramid
 Begun upon a large and ample base
 Shalt end in a little point a kind of nothing

 Enter below PESCARA MALATESTI RODERIGO and GRISOLAN

 PESCARA How now my lord

 MALATESTI O sad disaster

 RODERIGO How comes this

 BOSOLA Revenge for the Duchess of Malfi murdered
 By the Arragonian brethren for Antonio
 Slain by this hand for lustful Julia
 Poisond by this man and lastly for myself
 That was an actor in the main of all
 Much gainst mine own good nature yet i the end
 Neglected

 PESCARA How now my lord

 CARDINAL Look to my brother
 He gave us these large wounds as we were struggling
 Here i th rushes And now I pray let me
 Be laid by and never thought of
 Dies

 PESCARA How fatally it seems he did withstand
 His own rescue

 MALATESTI Thou wretched thing of blood
 How came Antonio by his death

 BOSOLA In a mist I know not how
 Such a mistake as I have often seen
 In a play O I am gone
 We are only like dead walls or vaulted graves
 That ruind yield no echo Fare you well
 It may be pain but no harm to me to die
 In so good a quarrel O this gloomy world
 In what a shadow or deep pit of darkness
 Doth womanish and fearful mankind live
 Let worthy minds neer stagger in distrust
 To suffer death or shame for what is just
 Mine is another voyage
 Dies

 PESCARA The noble Delio as I came to th palace
 Told me of Antonios being here and showd me
 A pretty gentleman his son and heir

 Enter DELIO and ANTONIOS Son

 MALATESTI O sir you come too late

 DELIO I heard so and
 Was armd for t ere I came Let us make noble use
 Of this great ruin and join all our force
 To establish this young hopeful gentleman
 In s mothers right These wretched eminent things
 Leave no more fame behind em than should one
 Fall in a frost and leave his print in snow
 As soon as the sun shines it ever melts
 Both form and matter I have ever thought
 Nature doth nothing so great for great men
 As when she s pleasd to make them lords of truth
 Integrity of life is fames best friend
 Which nobly beyond death shall crown the end
 Exeunt

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
To donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
