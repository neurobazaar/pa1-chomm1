INTRODUCTION

ANTON TCHEKOFF

THE last years of the nineteenth century were for Russia tinged with
doubt and gloom The hightide of vitality that had risen during the
Turkish war ebbed in the early eighties leaving behind it a dead
level of apathy which lasted until life was again quickened by the high
interests of the Revolution During these grey years the lonely country
and stagnant provincial towns of Russia buried a peasantry which
was enslaved by want and toil and an educated upper class which was
enslaved by idleness and tedium Most of the Intellectuals with no
outlet for their energies were content to forget their ennui in
vodka and cardplaying only the more idealistic gasped for air in the
stifling atmosphere crying out in despair against life as they saw it
and looking forward with a pathetic hope to happiness for humanity in
two or three hundred years It is the inevitable tragedy of their
existence and the pitiful humour of their surroundings that are
portrayed with such insight and sympathy by Anton Tchekoff who is
perhaps of modern writers the dearest to the Russian people

Anton Tchekoff was born in the old Black Sea port of Taganrog on
January 17 1860 His grandfather had been a serf his father married
a merchants daughter and settled in Taganrog where during Antons
boyhood he carried on a small and unsuccessful trade in provisions
The young Tchekoff was soon impressed into the services of the large
povertystricken family and he spoke regretfully in after years of his
hardworked childhood But he was obedient and goodnatured and worked
cheerfully in his fathers shop closely observing the idlers that
assembled there and gathering the drollest stories which he would
afterward whisper in class to his laughing schoolfellows Many were the
punishments which he incurred by this habit which was incorrigible

His grandfather had now become manager of an estate near Taganrog in
the wild steppe country of the Don Cossacks and here the boy spent his
summers fishing in the river and roving about the countryside as brown
as a gipsy sowing the seeds of that love for nature which he retained
all his life His evenings he liked best to spend in the kitchen of the
masters house among the work people and peasants who gathered there
taking part in their games and setting them all laughing by his witty
and telling observations

When Tchekoff was about fourteen his father moved the family to Moscow
leaving Anton in Taganrog and now relieved of work in the shop his
progress at school became remarkable At seventeen he wrote a long
tragedy which was afterward destroyed and he already showed flashes of
the wit that was soon to blaze into genius

He graduated from the high school at Taganrog with every honour entered
the University of Moscow as a student of medicine and threw himself
headlong into a double life of student and author in the attempt to
help his struggling family

His first story appeared in a Moscow paper in 1880 and after some
difficulty he secured a position connected with several of the smaller
periodicals for which during his student years he poured forth a
succession of short stories and sketches of Russian life with incredible
rapidity He wrote he tells us during every spare minute in crowded
rooms where there was no light and less air and never spent more
than a day on any one story He also wrote at this time a very stirring
bloodandthunder play which was suppressed by the censor and the fate
of which is not known

His audience demanded laughter above all things and with his deep
sense of the ridiculous Tchekoff asked nothing better His stories
though often based on themes profoundly tragic are penetrated by the
light and subtle satire that has won him his reputation as a great
humourist But though there was always a smile on his lips it was a
tender one and his sympathy with suffering often brought his laughter
near to tears

This delicate and original genius was at first subjected to harsh
criticism which Tchekoff felt keenly and Trigorins description in
The SeaGull of the trials of a young author is a cry from Tchekoffs
own soul A passionate enemy of all lies and oppression he already
foreshadows in these early writings the protest against conventions and
rules which he afterward put into Treplieffs reply to Sorin in The
SeaGull Let us have new forms or else nothing at all

In 1884 he took his degree as doctor of medicine and decided to
practise although his writing had by now taken on a professional
character He always gave his calling a high place and the doctors in
his works are drawn with affection and understanding If any one spoke
slightingly of doctors in his presence he would exclaim Stop You
dont know what country doctors do for the people

Tchekoff fully realised later the influence which his profession had
exercised on his literary work and sometimes regretted the too vivid
insight it gave him but on the other hand he was able to write Only
a doctor can know what value my knowledge of science has been to me
and It seems to me that as a doctor I have described the sicknesses of
the soul correctly For instance Trigorins analysis in The SeaGull
of the state of mind of an author has well been called artistic
diagnosis

The young doctorwriter is described at this time as modest and grave
with flashes of brilliant gaiety A son of the people there was in his
face an expression that recalled the simplehearted village lad his
eyes were blue his glance full of intelligence and kindness and his
manners unaffected and simple He was an untiring worker and between
his patients and his desk he led a life of ceaseless activity His
restless mind was dominated by a passion of energy and he thought
continually and vividly Often while jesting and talking he would seem
suddenly to plunge into himself and his look would grow fixed and deep
as if he were contemplating something important and strange Then he
would ask some unexpected question which showed how far his mind had
roamed

Success was now rapidly overtaking the young author his first
collection of stories appeared in 1887 another one in the same year had
immediate success and both went through many editions but at the same
time the shadows that darkened his later works began to creep over his
lighthearted humour

His impressionable mind began to take on the grey tinge of his time but
much of his sadness may also be attributed to his everincreasing ill
health

Weary and with an obstinate cough he went south in 1888 took a little
cottage on the banks of a little river abounding in fish and crabs
and surrendered himself to his touching love for nature happy in his
passion for fishing in the quiet of the country and in the music and
gaiety of the peasants One would gladly sell ones soul he writes
for the pleasure of seeing the warm evening sky and the streams and
pools reflecting the darkly mournful sunset He described visits to
his country neighbours and long drives in gay company during which he
says we ate every half hour and laughed to the verge of colic

His health however did not improve In 1889 he began to have attacks
of heart trouble and the sensitive artists nature appears in a remark
which he made after one of them I walked quickly across the terrace
on which the guests were assembled he said with one idea in my
mind how awkward it would be to fall down and die in the presence of
strangers

It was during this transition period of his life when his youthful
spirits were failing him that the stage for which he had always felt a
fascination tempted him to write Ivanoff and also a dramatic sketch
in one act entitled The Swan Song though he often declared that he
had no ambition to become a dramatist The Novel he wrote is a
lawful wife but the Stage is a noisy flashy and insolent mistress
He has put his opinion of the stage of his day in the mouth of
Treplieff in The SeaGull and he often refers to it in his letters
as an evil disease of the towns and the gallows on which dramatists
are hanged

He wrote Ivanoff at whiteheat in two and a half weeks as a protest
against a play he had seen at one of the Moscow theatres Ivanoff from
Ivan the commonest of Russian names was by no means meant to be
a hero but a most ordinary weak man oppressed by the immortal
commonplaces of life with his heart and soul aching in the grip of
circumstance one of the many useless people of Russia for whose
sorrow Tchekoff felt such overwhelming pity He saw nothing in their
lives that could not be explained and pardoned and he returns to his
illfated useless people again and again not to preach any doctrine
of pessimism but simply because he thought that the world was the
better for a certain fragile beauty of their natures and their touching
faith in the ultimate salvation of humanity

Both the writing and staging of Ivanoff gave Tchekoff great
difficulty The characters all being of almost equal importance he
found it hard to get enough good actors to take the parts but it
finally appeared in Moscow in 1889 a decided failure The author had
touched sharply several sensitive spots of Russian lifefor instance
in his warning not to marry a Jewess or a bluestockingand the play
was also marred by faults of inexperience which however he later
corrected The critics were divided in condemning a certain novelty
in it and in praising its freshness and originality The character of
Ivanoff was not understood and the weakness of the man blinded many to
the lifelike portrait Tchekoff himself was far from pleased with what
he called his literary abortion and rewrote it before it was produced
again in St Petersburg Here it was received with the wildest applause
and the morning after its performance the papers burst into unanimous
praise The author was enthusiastically feted but the burden of his
growing fame was beginning to be very irksome to him and he wrote
wearily at this time that he longed to be in the country fishing in the
lake or lying in the hay

His next play to appear was a farce entitled The Boor which he wrote
in a single evening and which had a great success This was followed by
The Demon a failure rewritten ten years later as Uncle Vanya

All Russia now combined in urging Tchekoff to write some important work
and this too was the writers dream but his only long story is The
Steppe which is after all but a series of sketches exquisitely
drawn and strung together on the slenderest connecting thread
Tchekoffs delicate and elusive descriptive power did not lend itself
to painting on a large canvas and his strange little tragicomedies of
Russian life his Tedious Tales as he called them were always to
remain his masterpieces

In 1890 Tchekoff made a journey to the Island of Saghalien after which
his health definitely failed and the consumption with which he had
long been threatened finally declared itself His illness exiled him to
the Crimea and he spent his last ten years there making frequent trips
to Moscow to superintend the production of his four important plays
written during this period of his life

The SeaGull appeared in 1896 and after a failure in St Petersburg
won instant success as soon as it was given on the stage of the Artists
Theatre in Moscow Of all Tchekoffs plays this one conforms most
nearly to our Western conventions and is therefore most easily
appreciated here In Trigorin the author gives us one of the rare
glimpses of his own mind for Tchekoff seldom put his own personality
into the pictures of the life in which he took such immense interest

In The SeaGull we see clearly the increase of Tchekoffs power of
analysis which is remarkable in his next play The Three Sisters
gloomiest of all his dramas

The Three Sisters produced in 1901 depends even more than most of
Tchekoffs plays on its interpretation and it is almost essential to
its appreciation that it should be seen rather than read The atmosphere
of gloom with which it is pervaded is a thousand times more intense when
it comes to us across the footlights In it Tchekoff probes the depths
of human life with so sure a touch and lights them with an insight so
piercing that the play made a deep impression when it appeared This
was also partly owing to the masterly way in which it was acted at the
Artists Theatre in Moscow The theme is as usual the greyness of
provincial life and the night is lit for his little group of characters
by a flash of passion so intense that the darkness which succeeds it
seems wellnigh intolerable

Uncle Vanya followed The Three Sisters and the poignant truth of
the picture together with the tender beauty of the last scene touched
his audience profoundly both on the stage and when the play was
afterward published

The Cherry Orchard appeared in 1904 and was Tchekoffs last play At
its production just before his death the author was feted as one of
Russias greatest dramatists Here it is not only country life that
Tchekoff shows us but Russian life and character in general in which
the old order is giving place to the new and we see the practical
modern spirit invading the vague aimless existence so dear to the
owners of the cherry orchard A new epoch was beginning and at its dawn
the singer of old dim Russia was silenced

In the year that saw the production of The Cherry Orchard Tchekoff
the favourite of the Russian people whom Tolstoi declared to be
comparable as a writer of stories only to Maupassant died suddenly in
a little village of the Black Forest whither he had gone a few weeks
before in the hope of recovering his lost health

Tchekoff with an art peculiar to himself in scattered scenes in
haphazard glimpses into the lives of his characters in seemingly
trivial conversations has succeeded in so concentrating the atmosphere
of the Russia of his day that we feel it in every line we read
oppressive as the mists that hang over a lake at dawn and like those
mists made visible to us by the light of an approaching day

THE SWAN SONG




CHARACTERS

VASILI SVIETLOVIDOFF a comedian 68 years old

NIKITA IVANITCH a prompter an old man


The Swan Song

The scene is laid on the stage of a country theatre at night after
the play To the right a row of rough unpainted doors leading into
the dressingrooms To the left and in the background the stage is
encumbered with all sorts of rubbish In the middle of the stage is an
overturned stool

SVIETLOVIDOFF With a candle in his hand comes out of a dressingroom
and laughs Well well this is funny Heres a good joke I fell asleep
in my dressingroom when the play was over and there I was calmly
snoring after everybody else had left the theatre Ah Im a foolish
old man a poor old dodderer I have been drinking again and so I fell
asleep in there sitting up That was clever Good for you old boy
Calls Yegorka Petrushka Where the devil are you Petrushka The
scoundrels must be asleep and an earthquake wouldnt wake them now
Yegorka Picks up the stool sits down and puts the candle on the
floor Not a sound Only echos answer me I gave Yegorka and Petrushka
each a tip today and now they have disappeared without leaving a trace
behind them The rascals have gone off and have probably locked up the
theatre Turns his head about Im drunk Ugh The play tonight was
for my benefit and it is disgusting to think how much beer and wine I
have poured down my throat in honour of the occasion Gracious My body
is burning all over and I feel as if I had twenty tongues in my mouth
It is horrid Idiotic This poor old sinner is drunk again and doesnt
even know what he has been celebrating Ugh My head is splitting I am
shivering all over and I feel as dark and cold inside as a cellar Even
if I dont mind ruining my health I ought at least to remember my age
old idiot that I am Yes my old age Its no use I can play the fool
and brag and pretend to be young but my life is really over now I
kiss my hand to the sixtyeight years that have gone by Ill never see
them again I have drained the bottle only a few little drops are left
at the bottom nothing but the dregs Yes yes thats the case Vasili
old boy The time has come for you to rehearse the part of a mummy
whether you like it or not Death is on its way to you Stares ahead
of him It is strange though that I have been on the stage now for
fortyfive years and this is the first time I have seen a theatre at
night after the lights have been put out The first time Walks up
to the footlights How dark it is I cant see a thing Oh yes I can
just make out the prompters box and his desk the rest is in pitch
darkness a black bottomless pit like a grave in which death itself
might be hiding Brr How cold it is The wind blows out of the
empty theatre as though out of a stone flue What a place for ghosts
The shivers are running up and down my back Calls Yegorka Petrushka
Where are you both What on earth makes me think of such gruesome
things here I must give up drinking Im an old man I shant live much
longer At sixtyeight people go to church and prepare for death but
here I amheavens A profane old drunkard in this fools dressIm
simply not fit to look at I must go and change it at once This is
a dreadful place I should die of fright sitting here all night Goes
toward his dressingroom at the same time NIKITA IVANITCH in a long
white coat comes out of the dressingroom at the farthest end of the
stage SVIETLOVIDOFF sees IVANITCHshrieks with terror and steps back
Who are you What What do you want Stamps his foot Who are you

IVANITCH It is I sir

SVIETLOVIDOFF Who are you

and trembles violently Heavens Who are you It is you    you

IVANITCH I spend my nights here in the dressingrooms Only please be
good enough not to tell Alexi Fomitch sir I have nowhere else to spend
the night indeed I havent

SVIETLOVIDOFF Ah It is you Nikitushka is it Just think the
audience called me out sixteen times they brought me three wreathes and
lots of other things too they were all wild with enthusiasm and yet
not a soul came when it was all over to wake the poor drunken old man
and take him home And I am an old man Nikitushka I am sixtyeight
years old and I am ill I havent the heart left to go on Falls
on IVANITCHS neck and weeps Dont go away Nikitushka I am old and

IVANITCH Weeping Your audience loves you master

SVIETLOVIDOFF My audience has gone home They are all asleep and have
forgotten their old clown No nobody needs me nobody loves me I have
no wife no children

IVANITCH Oh dear Oh dear Dont be so unhappy about it

SVIETLOVIDOFF But I am a man I am still alive Warm red blood is
tingling in my veins the blood of noble ancestors I am an aristocrat
Nikitushka I served in the army in the artillery before I fell as
low as this and what a fine young chap I was Handsome daring eager
Where has it all gone What has become of those old days Theres the
pit that has swallowed them all I remember it all now Fortyfive years
of my life lie buried there and what a life Nikitushka I can see it
as clearly as I see your face the ecstasy of youth faith passion the
love of womenwomen Nikitushka

IVANITCH It is time you went to sleep sir

SVIETLOVIDOFF When I first went on the stage in the first glow of
passionate youth I remember a woman loved me for my acting She was
beautiful graceful as a poplar young innocent pure and radiant as a
summer dawn Her smile could charm away the darkest night I remember
I stood before her once as I am now standing before you She had never
seemed so lovely to me as she did then and she spoke to me so with her
eyessuch a look I shall never forget it no not even in the
grave so tender so soft so deep so bright and young Enraptured
intoxicated I fell on my knees before her I begged for my happiness
and she said Give up the stage Give up the stage Do you understand
She could love an actor but marry himnever I was acting that day I
rememberI had a foolish clowns part and as I acted I felt my eyes
being opened I saw that the worship of the art I had held so sacred was
a delusion and an empty dream that I was a slave a fool the plaything
of the idleness of strangers I understood my audience at last and
since that day I have not believed in their applause or in their
wreathes or in their enthusiasm Yes Nikitushka The people applaud
me they buy my photograph but I am a stranger to them They dont know
me I am as the dirt beneath their feet They are willing enough to
meet me    but allow a daughter or a sister to marry me an outcast
never I have no faith in them sinks onto the stool no faith in them

IVANITCH Oh sir you look dreadfully pale you frighten me to death
Come go home have mercy on me

SVIETLOVIDOFF I saw through it all that day and the knowledge was
dearly bought Nikitushka After that    when that girl    well I
began to wander aimlessly about living from day to day without looking
ahead I took the parts of buffoons and low comedians letting my mind
go to wreck Ah but I was a great artist once till little by little I
threw away my talents played the motley fool lost my looks lost the
power of expressing myself and became in the end a Merry Andrew instead
of a man I have been swallowed up in that great black pit I never felt
it before but tonight when I woke up I looked back and there behind
me lay sixtyeight years I have just found out what it is to be old It
is all over    sobs    all over

IVANITCH There there dear master Be quiet    gracious Calls
Petrushka Yegorka

SVIETLOVIDOFF But what a genius I was You cannot imagine what power
I had what eloquence how graceful I was how tender how many strings
beats his breast quivered in this breast It chokes me to think of it
Listen now wait let me catch my breath there now listen to this

 The shade of bloody Ivan now returning
 Fans through my lips rebellion to a flame
 I am the dead Dimitri In the burning
 Boris shall perish on the throne I claim
 Enough The heir of Czars shall not be seen
 Kneeling to yonder haughty Polish Queen

 From Boris Godunoff by Pushkin translators note

Is that bad eh Quickly Wait now heres something from King
Lear The sky is black see Rain is pouring down thunder roars
lightningzzz zzz zzzsplits the whole sky and then listen

 Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow
 You cataracts and hurricanoes spout
 Till you have drenchd our steeples drownd the cocks
 You sulphurous thoughtexecuting fires
 Vauntcouriers of oakcleaving thunderbolts
 Singe my white head And thou all shaking thunder
 Strike flat the thick rotundity o the world
 Crack natures moulds all germons spill at once
 That make ungrateful man

Impatiently Now the part of the fool Stamps his foot Come take the
fools part Be quick I cant wait

IVANITCH Takes the part of the fool

O Nuncle court holywater in a dry house is better than this
rainwater out o door Good Nuncle in ask thy daughters blessing
heres a night pities neither wise men nor fools

SVIETLOVIDOFF

 Rumble thy bellyful spit fire spout rain
 Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
 I tax not you you elements with unkindness
 I never gave you kingdom calld you children

Ah there is strength there is talent for you Im a great artist Now
then heres something else of the same kind to bring back my youth to
me For instance take this from Hamlet Ill begin    Let me see
how does it go Oh yes this is it Takes the part of Hamlet

O the recorders let me see oneTo withdraw with you Why do you go
about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil

IVANITCH O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too
unmannerly

SVIETLOVIDOFF I do not well understand that Will you play upon this
pipe

IVANITCH My lord I cannot

SVIETLOVIDOFF I pray you

IVANITCH Believe me I cannot

SVIETLOVIDOFF I do beseech you

IVANITCH I know no touch of it my lord

SVIETLOVIDOFF Tis as easy as lying govern these vantages with your
finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse
most eloquent music Look you these are the stops

IVANITCH But these I cannot command to any utterance of harmony I
have not the skill

SVIETLOVIDOFF Why look you how unworthy a thing you make of me You
would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out
the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the
top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this
little organ yet cannot you make it speak Sblood Do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what instrument you will
though you can fret me you cannot play upon me laughs and clasps
Bravo Encore Bravo Where the devil is there any old age in that Im
not old that is all nonsense a torrent of strength rushes over me
this is life freshness youth Old age and genius cant exist together
You seem to be struck dumb Nikitushka Wait a second let me come to
my senses again Oh Good Lord Now then listen Did you ever hear such
tenderness such music Sh Softly

 The moon had set There was not any light
 Save of the lonely legiond watchstars pale
 In outer air and what by fits made bright
 Hot oleanders in a rosy vale
 Searched by the lamping fly whose little spark
 Went in and out like passions bashful hope

The noise of opening doors is heard Whats that

IVANITCH There are Petrushka and Yegorka coming back Yes you have
genius genius my master

SVIETLOVIDOFF Calls turning toward the noise Come here to me
boys To IVANITCH Let us go and get dressed Im not old All that is
foolishness nonsense laughs gaily What are you crying for You poor
old granny you whats the matter now This wont do There there
this wont do at all Come come old man dont stare so What makes
you stare like that There there Embraces him in tears Dont cry
Where there is art and genius there can never be such things as old age
or loneliness or sickness    and death itself is half    Weeps
No no Nikitushka It is all over for us now What sort of a genius am
I Im like a squeezed lemon a cracked bottle and youyou are the old
rat of the theatre    a prompter Come on They go Im no genius
Im only fit to be in the suite of Fortinbras and even for that I
am too old Yes Do you remember those lines from Othello
Nikitushka

 Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content
 Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars
 That make ambition virtue O farewell
 Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
 The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife
 The royal banner and all quality
 Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war

IVANITCH Oh Youre a genius a genius

SVIETLOVIDOFF And again this

 Away the moor is dark beneath the moon
 Rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even
 Away the gathering winds will call the darkness soon
 And profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven

They go out together the curtain falls slowly
