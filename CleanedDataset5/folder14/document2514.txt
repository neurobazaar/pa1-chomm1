T TEMBAROM

By Frances Hodgson Burnett




CHAPTER I


The boys at the Brooklyn public school which he attended did not know
what the T stood for He would never tell them All he said in reply
to questions was It dont stand for nothin Youve gotter have
a nitial aint you His name was in fact an almost inevitable
schoolboy modification of one felt to be absurd and pretentious His
Christian name was Temple which became Temp His surname was Barom
so he was at once Temp Barom In the natural tendency to avoid
waste of time it was pronounced as one word and the letter p being
superfluous and cumbersome it easily settled itself into Tembarom
and there remained By much less inevitable processes have surnames
evolved themselves as centuries rolled by Tembarom liked it and soon
almost forgot he had ever been called anything else

His education really began when he was ten years old At that time
his mother died of pneumonia contracted by going out to sew at
seventyfive cents a day in shoes almost entirely without soles when
the remains of a blizzard were melting in the streets As after her
funeral there remained only twentyfive cents in the shabby bureau
which was one of the few articles furnishing the room in the tenement in
which they lived together Tembarom sleeping on a cot the world spread
itself before him as a place to explore in search of at least one meal
a day There was nothing to do but to explore it to the best of his
tenyearold ability

His father had died two years before his mother and Tembarom had
vaguely felt it a relief He had been a resentful domestically
tyrannical immigrant Englishman who held in contempt every American
trait and institution He had come over to better himself detesting
England and the English because there was no chance for a man there
and transferring his dislikes and resentments from one country to
another had met with no better luck than he had left behind him
This he felt to be the fault of America and his family which was
represented solely by Tembarom and his mother heard a good deal about
it and also rather contradictorily a good deal about the advantages
and superiority of England to which in the course of six months he
became gloomily loyal It was necessary in fact for him to have
something with which to compare the United States unfavorably The
effect he produced on Tembarom was that of causing him when he entered
the public school round the corner to conceal with determination
verging on duplicity the humiliating fact that if he had not been born
in Brooklyn he might have been born in England England was not popular
among the boys in the school History had represented the country to
them in all its tyrannical rapacity and bloodthirsty oppression of the
humble freeborn The manly and admirable attitude was to say Give me
liberty or give me deathand there was the Fourth of July

Though Tembarom and his mother had been poor enough while his father
lived when he died the returns from his irregular odd jobs no longer
came in to supplement his wifes sewing and add an occasional day or
two of fuller meals in consequence of which they were oftener than ever
hungry and cold and in desperate trouble about the rent of their room
Tembarom who was a wiry enterprising little fellow sometimes found an
odd job himself He carried notes and parcels when any one would trust
him with them he split old boxes into kindlingwood more than once he
minded a baby when its mother left its perambulator outside a store
But at eight or nine years of age ones pay is in proportion to ones
size Tembarom however had neither his fathers bitter eye nor his
mothers discouraged one Something different from either had been
reincarnated in him from some more cheerful past He had an alluring
grin insteada grin which curled up his mouth and showed his sound
healthy young teetha lot of themand people liked to see them

At the beginning of the world it is only recently reasonable to suppose
human beings were made with healthy bodies and healthy minds That of
course was the original scheme of the race It would not have been
worth while to create a lot of things aimlessly ill made A journeyman
carpenter would not waste his time in doing it if he knew any better
Given the power to make a man even an amateur would make him as
straight as he could inside and out Decent vanity would compel him to
do it He would be ashamed to show the thing and admit he had done it
much less people a world with millions of like proofs of incompetence
Logically considered the race was built straight and clean and healthy
and happy How since then it has developed in multitudinous less sane
directions and lost its normal straightness and proportions I am
singularly enough not entirely competent to explain with any degree of
satisfactory detail But it cannot be truthfully denied that this has
rather generally happened There are human beings who are not beautiful
there are those who are not healthy there are those who hate people and
things with much waste of physical and mental energy there are people
who are not unwilling to do others an ill turn by word or deed and
there are those who do not believe that the original scheme of the race
was ever a decent one

This is all abnormal and unintelligent even the not being beautiful
and sometimes one finds oneself called upon passionately to resist
a temptation to listen to an internal hint that the whole thing is
aimless Upon this tendency one may as well put ones foot firmly as it
leads nowhere At such times it is supporting to call to mind a certain
undeniable fact which ought to loom up much larger in our philosophical
calculations No one has ever made a collection of statistics regarding
the enormous number of perfectly sane kind friendly decent creatures
who form a large proportion of any mass of human beings anywhere and
everywherepeople who are not vicious or cruel or depraved not as a
result of continual selfcontrol but simply because they do not want to
be because it is more natural and agreeable to be exactly the opposite
things people who do not tell lies because they could not do it with
any pleasure and would on the contrary find the exertion an annoyance
and a bore people whose manners and morals are good because their
natural preference lies in that direction There are millions of them
who in most essays on life and living are virtually ignored because
they do none of the things which call forth eloquent condemnation or
brilliant cynicism It has not yet become the fashion to record them
When one reads a daily newspaper filled with dramatic elaborations
of crimes and unpleasantness one sometimes wishes attention might be
called to themto their numbers to their decencies to their normal
lack of any desire to do violence and their equally normal disposition
to lend a hand One is inclined to feel that the majority of persons do
not believe in their existence But if an accident occurs in the street
there are always several of them who appear to spring out of the earth
to give human sympathy and assistance if a national calamity physical
or social takes place the world suddenly seems full of them They are
the thousands of Browns Joneses and Robinsons who massed
together send food to faminestricken countries sustenance to
earthquakedevastated regions aid to wounded soldiers or miners or
floodswept homelessness They are the ones who have happened naturally
to continue to grow straight and carry out the First Intention They
really form the majority if they did not the people of the earth would
have eaten one another alive centuries ago But though this is surely
true a happy cynicism totally disbelieves in their existence When a
combination of circumstances sufficiently dramatic brings one of them
into prominence he is either called an angel or a fool He is neither
He is only a human creature who is normal

After this manner Tembarom was wholly normal He liked work and rejoiced
in good cheer when he found it however attenuated its form He was a
good companion and even at ten years old a practical person He took
his loose coppers from the old bureau drawer and remembering that he
had several times helped Jake Hutchins to sell his newspapers he went
forth into the world to find and consult him as to the investment of his
capital

Where are you goin Tem a woman who lived in the next room said when
she met him on the stairs What you goin to do

Im goin to sell newspapers if I can get some with this he replied
opening his hand to show her the extent of his resources

She was almost as poor as he was but not quite She looked him over
curiously for a moment and then fumbled in her pocket She drew out two
tencent pieces and considered them hesitating Then she looked again
at him That normal expression in his nice tenyearold eyes had its
suggestive effect

You take this she said handing him the two pieces Itll help you
to start

Ill bring it back maam said Tem Thank you Mis Hullingworth

In about two weeks time he did bring it back That was the beginning
He lived through all the experiences a small boy waif and stray would be
likely to come in contact with The abnormal class treated him ill and
the normal class treated him well He managed to get enough food to eat
to keep him from starvation Sometimes he slept under a roof and much
oftener outofdoors He preferred to sleep outofdoors more than half
of the year and the rest of the time he did what he could He saw and
learned many strange things but was not undermined by vice because he
unconsciously preferred decency He sold newspapers and annexed any old
job which appeared on the horizon The education the New York streets
gave him was a liberal one He became accustomed to heat and cold and
wet weather but having sound lungs and a tough little body combined
with the normal tendencies already mentioned he suffered no more
physical deterioration than a young Indian would suffer After selling
newspapers for two years he got a place as boy in a small store The
advance signified by steady employment was inspiring to his energies He
forged ahead and got a better job and better pay as he grew older By
the time he was fifteen he shared a small bedroom with another boy
In whatsoever quarter he lived friends seemed sporadic Other boys
congregated about him He did not know he had any effect at all but
his effect in fact was rather like that of a fire in winter or a cool
breeze in summer It was natural to gather where it prevailed

There came a time when he went to a night class to learn stenography
Great excitement had been aroused among the boys he knew best by a
rumor that there were fellows who could earn a hundred dollars a week
writing short Boyhood could not resist the florid splendor of the
idea Four of them entered the class confidently looking forward to
becoming the recipients of four hundred a month in the course of six
weeks One by one they dropped off until only Tembarom remained slowly
forging ahead He had never meant anything else but to get on in the
worldto get as far as he could He kept at his short and by the
time he was nineteen it helped him to a place in a newspaper office
He took dictation from a nervous and harried editor who when he
was driven to frenzy by overwork and incompetencies found that the
longlegged clean youth with the grin never added fuel to the flame
of his wrath He was a common young man who was not marked by special
brilliancy of intelligence but he had a clear head and a good temper
and a queer aptitude for being able to see himself in the other mans
shoeshis difficulties and moods This ended in his being tried with
bits of new work now and then In an emergency he was once sent out to
report the details of a fire What he brought back was usable and his
elation when he found he had actually made good was ingenuous enough
to spur Galton the editor into trying him again

To Tembarom this was a magnificent experience The literary suggestion
implied by being on a newspaper was more than he had hoped for If you
have sold newspapers and slept in a barrel or behind a pile of lumber
in a woodyard to report a fire in a streetcar shed seems a flight of
literature He applied himself to the careful study of newspaperstheir
points of view their style of phrasing He believed them to be perfect
To attain ease in expressing himself in their elevated language he felt
to be the summit of lofty ambition He had no doubts of the exaltation
of his ideal His respect and confidence almost made Galton cry at
times because they recalled to him days when he had been nineteen and
had regarded New York journalists with reverence He liked Tembarom more
and more It actually soothed him to have him about and he fell into
giving him one absurd little chance after another When he brought in
stuff which bore too evident marks of utter ignorance he actually
touched it up and used it giving him an enlightening ironical hint or
so Tembarom always took the hints with gratitude He had no mistaken
ideas of his own powers Galton loomed up before him a sort of god and
though the editor was a man with a keen though wearied brain and a
sense of humor the situation was one naturally productive of harmonious
relations He was of the many who unknowingly came in out of the cold
and stood in the glow of Tembaroms warm fire or took refuge from the
heat in his cool breeze He did not know of the private arduous study
of journalistic style and it was not unpleasing to see that the nice
young cub was gradually improving Through pure modest fear or ridicule
Tembarom kept to himself his vaulting ambition He practised reports of
fires weddings and accidents in his hall bedroom

A hall bedroom in a thirdrate boardinghouse is not a cheerful place
but when Tembarom vaguely felt this he recalled the nights spent in
empty trucks and behind lumberpiles and thought he was getting spoiled
by luxury He told himself that he was a fellow who always had luck
He did not know neither did any one else that his luck would have
followed him if he had lived in a coalhole It was the concomitant
of his normal build and outlook on life Mrs Bowse his hardworked
landlady began by being calmed down by his mere bearing when he came
to apply for his room and board She had a touch of grippe and had
just emerged from a heated affray with a dirty cook and was inclined to
battle when he presented himself In a few minutes she was inclined to
battle no longer She let him have the room Cantankerous restrictions
did not ruffle him

Of course what you say GOES he said giving her his friendly grin
Any one that takes boarders has GOT to be careful Youre in for a bad
cold aint you

Ive got grippe again thats what Ive got she almost snapped

Did you ever try Paysons G Destroyer G stands for grippe you
know Catchy name aint it They say the man that invented it got ten
thousand dollars for it G Destroyer You feel like you have to find
out what it means when you see it up on a boarding Im just over grippe
myself and Ive got half a bottle in my pocket You carry it about with
you and swallow one every halfhour You just try it It set me right
in no time

He took the bottle out of his waistcoat pocket and handed it to her She
took it and turned it over

Youre awful goodnaturedShe hesitatedbut I aint going to take
your medicine I ought to go and get some for myself How much does it
cost

Its on the bottle but its having to get it for yourself thats the
matter You wont have time and youll forget it

Thats true enough said Mrs Bowse looking at him sharply I guess
you know something about boardinghouses

I guess I know something about trying to earn three meals a dayor two
of them Its no merry jest whichever way you do it




CHAPTER II


When he took possession of his hall bedroom the next day and came down
to his first meal all the boarders looked at him interestedly They had
heard of the G Destroyer from Mrs Bowse whose grippe had disappeared
Jim Bowles and Julius Steinberger looked at him because they were about
his own age and shared a hall bedroom on his floor the young woman
from the notion counter in a downtown department store looked at him
because she was a young woman the rest of the company looked at him
because a young man in a hall bedroom might or might not be noisy
or objectionable and the incident of the G Destroyer sounded
goodnatured Mr Joseph Hutchinson the stout and discontented
Englishman from Manchester looked him over because the mere fact that
he was a newcomer had placed him by his own rash act in the position of
a target for criticism Mr Hutchinson had come to New York because he
had been told that he could find backers among profuse and innumerable
multimillionaires for the invention which had been the haunting vision
of his uninspiring life He had not been met with the careless
rapture which had been described to him and he was becoming violently
antagonistic to American capital and pessimistic in his views of
American institutions Like Tembaroms father he was the resentful
Englishman

I dont think much o that chap he said in what he considered an
undertone to his daughter who sat beside him and tried to manage that
he should not be infuriated by waiting for butter and bread and second
helpings A fine healthy old feudal feeling that servants should be
roared at if they did not look sharp when he wanted anything was one
of his salient characteristics

Wait a bit Father we dont know anything about him yet Ann
Hutchinson murmured quietly hoping that his words had been lost in the
clatter of knives and forks and dishes

As Tembarom had taken his seat he had found that when he looked across
the table he looked directly at Miss Hutchinson and before the meal
ended he felt that he was in great good luck to be placed opposite an
object of such singular interest He knew nothing about types but if
he had been of those who do he would probably have said to himself that
she was of a type apart As it was he merely felt that she was of a
kind one kept looking at whether one ought to or not She was a little
thing of that exceedingly light slimness of build which makes a girl a
childish featherweight Few girls retain it after fourteen or fifteen
A wind might supposably have blown her away but one knew it would not
because she was firm and steady on her small feet Ordinary strength
could have lifted her with one hand and would have been tempted to do
it She had a slim round throat and the English daisy face it upheld
caused it to suggest to the mind the stem of a flower The roundness of
her cheek in and out of which totally unexpected dimples flickered
and the forgetmenot blueness of her eyes which were large and rather
round also made her look like a nice baby of singularly serious and
observing mind She looked at one as certain aweinspiring things in
perambulators look at onewith a far and clear silence of gaze which
passes beyond earthly obstacles and reserves a benign patience with
follies Tembarom felt interestedly that one really might quail before
it if one had anything of an inferior quality to hide And yet it was
not a critical gaze at all She wore a black dress with a bit of white
collar and she had so much soft red hair that he could not help
recalling one or two women who owned the same quantity and seemed able
to carry it only as a sort of untidy bundle Hers looked entirely under
control and yet was such a wonder of burnished fullness that it tempted
the hand to reach out and touch it It became Tembaroms task during the
meal to keep his eyes from turning too often toward it and its owner

If she had been a girl who took things hard she might have taken her
father very hard indeed But opinions and feelings being solely a matter
of points of view she was very fond of him and regarding him as
a sacred charge and duty took care of him as though she had been a
reverentially inclined mother taking care of a boisterous son When his
roar was heard her calm little voice always fell quietly on indignant
ears the moment it ceased It was her part in life to act as a
palliative her mother whose welltrained attitude toward the ruling
domestic male was of the early Victorian order had lived and died one
A nicer warmer little woman had never existed Joseph Hutchinson had
adored and depended on her as much as he had harried her When he had
charged about like a mad bull because he could not button his collar or
find the pipe he had mislaid in his own pocket she had never said more
than Now Mr Hutchinson or done more than leave her sewing to button
the collar with soothing fingers and suggest quietly that sometimes he
DID chance to carry his pipe about with him She was of the class which
used to call its husband by a respectful surname When she died she left
him as a sort of legacy to her daughter spending the last weeks of her
life in explaining affectionately all that Father needed to keep him
quiet and make him comfortable

Little Ann had never forgotten a detail and had even improved upon
some of them as she happened to be cleverer than her mother and had
indeed a farseeing and clear young mind of her own She had been
called Little Ann all her life This had held in the first place
because her mothers name had been Ann also and after her mothers
death the diminutive had not fallen away from her People felt it
belonged to her not because she was especially little though she was a
small light person but because there was an affectionate humor in the
sound of it

Despite her hard needs Mrs Bowse would have faced the chance of losing
two boarders rather than have kept Mr Joseph Hutchinson but for Little
Ann As it was she kept them both and in the course of three months
the girl was Little Ann to almost every one in the house Her normalness
took the form of an instinct which amounted to genius for seeing what
people ought to have and in some occult way filling in bare or trying
places

Shes just a wonder that girl Mrs Bowse said to one boarder after
another

Shes just a wonder Jim Bowles and Julius Steinberger murmured to
each other in rueful confidence as they tilted their chairs against
the wall of their hall bedroom and smoked Each of the shabby and
povertystricken young men had of course fallen hopelessly in love with
her at once This was merely human and inevitable but realizing in
the course of a few weeks that she was too busy taking care of her
irritable boisterous old Manchester father and everybody else to have
time to be made love to even by young men who could buy new boots when
the old ones had ceased to be watertight they were obliged to resign
themselves to the after all comforting fact that she became a mother
to them not a sister She mended their socks and sewed buttons on for
them with a firm frankness which could not be persuaded into meaning
anything more sentimental than a fixed habit of repairing anything which
needed it and which while at first bewildering in its serenity ended
by reducing the two youths to a dust of devotion

Shes a wonder she is they sighed when at every weekend they found
their forlorn and scanty washing resting tidily on their bed

In the course of a week more or less Tembaroms feeling for her would
have been exactly that of his two hallbedroom neighbors but that his
nature though a practical one was not inclined to any supine degree of
resignation He was a sensible youth however and gave no trouble Even
Joseph Hutchinson who of course resented furiously any nonsense of
which his daughter and possession was the object became sufficiently
mollified by his good spirits and ready good nature to refrain from open
conversational assault

I dont mind that chap as much as I did at first he admitted
reluctantly to Little Ann one evening after a good dinner and a
comfortable pipe Hes not such a fool as he looks

Tembarom was given as Little Ann was to seeing what people wanted He
knew when to pass the mustard and other straying condiments He picked
up things which dropped inconveniently he did not interrupt the remarks
of his elders and betters and several times when he chanced to be
in the hall and saw Mr Hutchinson in irritable stout Englishman
fashion struggling into his overcoat he sprang forward with a light
friendly air and helped him He did not do it with ostentatious
politeness or with the manner of active youth giving generous aid to
elderly avoirdupois He did it as though it occurred to him as a natural
result of being on the spot

It took Mrs Bowse and her boardinghouse less than a week definitely
to like him Every night when he sat down to dinner he brought news with
himnews and jokes and new slang Newspaperoffice anecdote and talk
gave a journalistic air to the gathering when he was present and there
was novelty in it Soon every one was intimate with him and interested
in what he was doing Galtons goodnatured patronage of him was a thing
to which no one was indifferent It was felt to be the right thing in
the right place When he came home at night it became the custom to ask
him questions as to the bits of luck which befell him He became
T T instead of Mr Tembarom except to Joseph Hutchinson and his
daughter Hutchinson called him Tembarom but Little Ann said Mr
Tembarom with quaint frequency when she spoke to him

Landed anything today T T some one would ask almost every
evening and the interest in his relation of the days adventures
increased from week to week Little Ann never asked questions and seldom
made comments but she always listened attentively She had gathered
and guessed from what she had gathered a rather definite idea of what
his hard young life had been He did not tell pathetic stories about
himself but he and Jim Bowles and Julius Steinberger had become fast
friends and the genial smoking of cheap tobacco in hall bedrooms tends
to frankness of relation and the various ways in which each had found
himself up against it in the course of their brief years supplied
material for anecdotal talk

But its bound to be easier from now on he would say Ive got the
short down pretty finenot fine enough to make big money but enough
to hold down a job with Galton Hes mighty good to me If I knew more
I believe hed give me a column to take care ofUptown Society column
perhaps A fellow named Bikers got it Twenty per Goes on a bust twice
a month the fool Gee I wish I had his job

Mrs Bowses house was provided with a parlor in which her boarders
could sit in the evening when so inclined It was a fearsome room
which when the dark highceilinged hall was entered revealed depths
of dingy gloom which appeared splashed in spots with incongruous
brilliancy of color This effect was produced by richly framed
departmentstore chromo lithographs on the walls aided by lurid
cushioncovers or tidies representing Indian maidens or chieftains
in full war paint or clusters of poppies of great boldness of hue
They had either been Christmas gifts bestowed upon Mrs Bowse or
departmentstore bargains of her own selection purchased with thrifty
intent The redandgreen plush upholstered walnut chairs arid sofa had
been acquired by her when the bankruptcy of a neighboring boardinghouse
brought them within her means They were no longer very red or very
green and the cheerfully hopeful design of the tidies and cushions had
been to conceal worn places and stains The mantelpiece was adorned by a
blackwalnutandgoldframed mirror and innumerable vases of the ornate
ninetyeightcents order The centerpiece held a large and extremely
soiled spray of artificial wistaria The end of the room was rendered
attractive by a tentlike cozycorner built of savage weapons and
Oriental cotton stuffs long ago become stringy and almost leprous in
hue The proprietor of the bankrupt boardinghouse had been artistic
But Mrs Bowse was a goodenough soul whose boarders liked her and her
house and when the gas was lighted and some one played ragtime on
the secondhand pianola they liked the parlor

Little Ann did not often appear in it but now and then she came down
with her bit of sewingshe always had a bit of sewingand she sat
in the cozycorner listening to the talk or letting some one confide
troubles to her Sometimes it was the New England widow Mrs Peck who
looked like a spinster schoolmaam but who had a married son with a
nice wife who lived in Harlem and drank heavily She used to consult
with Little Ann as to the possible wisdom of putting a drink deterrent
privately in his tea Sometimes it was Mr Jakes a depressed little
man whose wife had left him for no special reason he could discover
Oftenest perhaps it was Julius Steinberger or Jim Bowles who did
their ingenuous best to present themselves to her as energetic if not
successful young business men not wholly unworthy of attention and
always breathing daily increasing devotion Sometimes it was Tembarom
of whom her opinion had never been expressed but who seemed to have
made friends with her She liked to hear about the newspaper office and
Mr Galton and never was uninterested in his hopes of making good
She seemed to him the wisest and most direct and composed person he had
ever known She spoke with the broad flat friendly Manchester accent
and when she let drop a suggestion it carried a delightfully sober
conviction with it because what she said was generally a revelation of
logical mental argument concerning details she had gathered through her
little way of listening and saying nothing whatever

If Mr Biker drinks he wont keep his place she said to Tembarom one
night Perhaps you might get it yourself if you persevere

Tembarom reddened a little He really reddened through joyous
excitement

Say I didnt know you knew a thing about that he answered Youre
a regular wonder You scarcely ever say anything but the way you get on
to things gets me

Perhaps if I talked more I shouldnt notice as much she said turning
her bit of sewing round and examining it I never was much of a talker
Fathers a good talker and Mother and me got into the way of listening
You do if you live with a good talker

Tembarom looked at the girl with a male gentleness endeavoring to
subdue open expression of the fact that he was convinced that she was as
thoroughly aware of her fathers salient characteristics as she was of
other things

You do said Tembarom Then picking up her scissors which had dropped
from her lap and politely returning them he added anxiously To think
of you remembering Biker I wonder if I ever did get his job if I
could hold it down

Yes decided Little Ann you could Ive noticed youre that kind of
person Mr Tembarom

Have you he said elatedly Say honest Injun

Yes

I shall be getting stuck on myself if you encourage me like that
he said and then his face falling he added Biker graduated at
Princeton

I dont know much about society Little Ann remarkedI never saw
any either uptown or downtown or in the countrybut I shouldnt
think youd have to have a college education to write the things you see
about it in the newspaper paragraphs

Tembarom grinned

Theyre not real highbrow stuff are they he said There was
a brilliant gathering on Tuesday evening at the house of Mr Jacob
Sturtburger at 79 Two Hundredth Street on the occasion of the marriage
of his daughter Miss Rachel Sturtburger to Mr Eichenstein The bride
was attired in white peau de cygne trimmed with duchess lace

Little Ann took him up I dont know what peau de cygne is and I
daresay the bride doesnt Ive never been to anything but a village
school but I could make up paragraphs like that myself

Thats the uptown kind said Tembarom The downtown ones wear
their mothers pointlace weddingveils sometimes but theyre not much
different Say I believe I could do it if I had luck

So do I returned Little Ann

Tembarom looked down at the carpet thinking the thing over Ann went on
sewing

Thats the way with you he said presently you put things into a
fellows head Youve given me a regular boost Little Ann

It is not unlikely that but for the sensible conviction in her voice he
would have felt less bold when two weeks later Biker having gone upon
a bust too prolonged was dismissed without benefit of clergy and
Galton desperately turned to Tembarom with anxious question in his eye

Do you think you could take this job he said

Tembaroms heart as he believed at the time jumped into his throat

What do you think Mr Galton he asked

It isnt a thing to think about was Galtons answer Its a thing I
must be sure of

Well said Tembarom if you give it to me Ill put up a mighty hard
fight before I fall down

Galton considered him scrutinizing keenly his tough longbuilt body
his sharp eager boyish face and especially his companionable grin

Well let it go at that he decided Youll make friends up in
Harlem and you wont find it hard to pick up news We can at least try
it

Tembaroms heart jumped into his throat again and he swallowed it once
more He was glad he was not holding his hat in his hand because he knew
he would have forgotten himself and thrown it up into the air

Thank you Mr Galton he said flushing tremendously Id like to
tell you how I appreciate your trusting me but I dont know how Thank
you sir

When he appeared in Mrs Bowses diningroom that evening there was a
glow of elation about him and a swing in his entry which attracted all
eyes at once For some unknown reason everybody looked at him and
meeting his eyes detected the presence of some new exultation

Landed anything T T Jim Bowles cried out You look it

Sure I look it Tembarom answered taking his napkin out of its
ring with an unconscious flourish Ive landed the uptown society
pagelanded it by gee

A goodhumored chorus of ejaculatory congratulation broke forth all
round the table

Good business Three cheers for T T Glad of it Heres luck
said one after another

They were all pleased and it was generally felt that Galton had shown
sense and done the right thing again Even Mr Hutchinson rolled about
in his chair and grunted his approval

After dinner Tembarom Jim Bowles and Julius Steinberger went
upstairs stairs together and filled the hall bedroom with clouds of
tobaccosmoke tilting their chairs against the wall smoking their
pipes furiously flushed and talkative working themselves up with the
exhilarated plannings of youth Jim Bowles and Julius had been down on
their luck for several weeks and that good old T T should come in
with this fairystory was an actual stimulus If you have never in your
life been able to earn more than will pay for your food and lodging
twenty dollars looms up large It might be the beginning of anything

First thing is to get on to the way to do it argued Tembarom I
dont know the first thing Ive got to think it out I couldnt ask
Biker He wouldnt tell me anyhow

Hes pretty mad I guess said Steinberger

Mad as hops Tembarom answered As I was coming downstairs from
Galtons room he was standing in the hall talking to Miss Dooley and
he said That Tembarom fellows going to do it He doesnt know how to
spell I should like to see his stuff come in He said it loud because
he wanted me to hear it and he sort of laughed through his nose

Say T T can you spell Jim inquired thoughtfully

Spell Me No Tembarom owned with unshaken good cheer What Ive got
to do is to get a tame dictionary and keep it chained to the leg of my
table Those words with two ms or two ls in them get me right down on
the mat But the thing that looks biggest to me is how to find out where
the news is and the name of the fellow thatll put me on to it You
cant go up a mans front steps and ring the bell and ask him if hes
going to be married or buried or have a pink tea

Wasnt that a knock at the door said Steinberger

It was a knock and Tembarom jumped up and threw the door open thinking
Mrs Bowse might have come on some household errand But it was Little
Ann Hutchinson instead of Mrs Bowse and there was a threaded needle
stuck into the front of her dress and she had on a thimble

I want Mr Bowless new socks she said maternally I promised Id
mark them for him

Bowles and Steinberger sprang from their chairs and came forward in the
usual comfortable glow of pleasure at sight of her

What do you think of that for all the comforts of a home said
Tembarom As if it wasnt enough for a man to have new socks without
having marks put on them What are your old socks made of anyhowsolid
gold Burglars aint going to break in and steal them

They wont when Ive marked them Mr Tembarom answered Little Ann
looking up at him with sober round forgetmenot blue eyes but with
a deep dimple breaking out near her lip but all three pairs would not
come home from the wash if I didnt

Three pairs ejaculated Tembarom Hes got three pairs of socks New
Thats whats been the matter with him for the last week Dont you mark
them for him Little Ann Taint good for a man to have everything

Here they are said Jim bringing them forward Twentyfive marked
down to ten at Tracys Are they pretty good

Little Ann looked them over with the practised eye of a connoisseur of
bargains

Theyd be about a shilling in Manchester shops she decided and they
might be put down to sixpence Theyre good enough to take care of

She was not the young woman who is ready for prolonged lively
conversation in halls and at bedroom doors and she had turned away with
the new socks in her hand when Tembarom suddenly inspired darted after
her

Say Ive just thought of something he exclaimed eagerly Its
something I want to ask you

What is it

Its about the societypage layout He hesitated I wonder if itd
be rushing you too much ifsay he suddenly broke off and standing
with his hands in his pockets looked down at her with anxious
admiration I believe you just know about everything

No I dont Mr Tembarom but Im very glad about the page
Everybodys glad

One of the chief difficulties Tembarom found facing him when he talked
to Little Ann was the difficulty of resisting an awful temptation to
take hold of herto clutch her to his healthy tumultuous young breast
and hold her there firmly He was half ashamed of himself when he
realized it but he knew that his venial weakness was shared by Jim
Bowles and Steinberger and probably others She was so slim and light
and soft and the serious frankness of her eyes and the quaint air of
being a sort of grownup child of astonishing intelligence produced an
effect it was necessary to combat with

What I wanted to say he put it to her was that I believe if youd
just let me talk this thing out to you itd do me good I believe youd
help me to get somewhere Ive got to fix up a scheme for getting next
the people who have things happening to them that I can make society
stuff out of you know Biker didnt make a hit of it but gee Ive
just got to Ive got to

Yes answered Little Ann her eyes fixed on him thoughtfully youve
got to Mr Tembarom

Theres not a soul in the parlor Would you mind coming down and
sitting there while I talk at you and try to work things out You could
go on with your marking

She thought it over a minute

Ill do it if Father can spare me she made up her mind Ill go and
ask him

She went to ask him and returned in two or three minutes with her small
sewingbasket in her hand

He can spare me she said Hes reading his paper and doesnt want
to talk

They went downstairs together and found the room empty Tembarom turned
up the lowered gas and Little Ann sat down in the cozycorner with her
workbasket on her knee Tembarom drew up a chair and sat down opposite
to her She threaded a needle and took up one of Jims new socks

Now she said

Its like this he explained The page is a new deal anyhow There
didnt used to be an uptown society column at all It was all Fifth
Avenue and the four hundred but ours isnt a fashionable paper and
their four hundred aint going to buy it to read their names in it
Theyd rather pay to keep out of it Uptowns growing like smoke and
theres lots of people up that way thatd like their friends to read
about their weddings and receptions and would buy a dozen copies to
send away when their names were in Theres no end of women and girls
thatd like to see their clothes described and let their friends read
the descriptions Theyd buy the paper too you bet Itll be a big
circulationincreaser Its Galtons idea and he gave the job to Biker
because he thought an educated fellow could get hold of people But
somehow he couldnt Seems as if they didnt like him He kept getting
turned down The page has been mighty poorno pictures of brides or
anything Galtons been sick over it Hed been sure itd make a hit
Then Bikers always drinking more or less and hes got the swell head
anyhow I believe thats the reason he couldnt make good with the
uptowners

Perhaps he was too well educated Mr Tembarom said Little Ann She
was marking a letter J in red cotton and her outward attention was
apparently wholly fixed on her work

Say now Tembarom broke out theres where you come in You go on
working as if there was nothing but that sock in New York but I guess
youve just hit the dot Perhaps that was it He wanted to do Fifth
Avenue work anyway and he didnt go at Harlem right He put on
Princeton airs when he asked questions Gee a fellow cant put on any
kind of airs when hes the one thats got to ask

Youll get on better remarked Little Ann Youve got a friendly way
and youve a lot of sense Ive noticed it

Her head was bent over the red J and she still looked at it and not at
Tembarom This was not coyness but simple calm absorption If she had
not been making the J she would have sat with her hands folded in her
lap and gazed at the young man with undisturbed attention

Have you said Tembarom gratefully That gives me another
boost Little Ann What a man seems to need most is just plain
twentycentsayard sense Not that I ever thought I had the dollar
kind Im not putting on airs

Mr Galton knows the kind you have I suppose thats why he gave you
the page The words spoken in the shrewdsounding Manchester accent
were neither flattering nor unflattering they were merely impartial

Well now Ive got it I cant fall down said Tembarom Ive got
to find out for myself how to get next to the people I want to talk to
Ive got to find out who to get next to

Little Ann put in the final red stitch of the letter J and laid the sock
neatly folded on the basket

Ive just been thinking something Mr Tembarom she said Who makes
the weddingcakes

He gave a delighted start

Gee he broke out the weddingcakes

Yes Little Ann proceeded theyd have to have weddingcakes and
perhaps if you went to the shops where theyre sold and could make
friends with the people theyd tell you whom they were selling them to
and you could get the addresses and go and find out things

Tembarom glowing with admiring enthusiasm thrust out his hand

Little Ann shake he said Youve given me the whole show just
like I thought you would Youre just the limit

Well a weddingcakes the next thing after the bride she answered

Her practical little head had given him the practical lead The mere
weddingcake opened up vistas Confectioners supplied not only weddings
but refreshments for receptions and dances Dances suggested the halls
in which they were held You could get information at such places Then
there were the churches and the florists who decorated festal scenes
Tembaroms excitement grew as he talked One plan led to another vistas
opened on all sides It all began to look so easy that he could not
understand how Biker could possibly have gone into such a land of
promise and returned embittered and emptyhanded

He thought too much of himself and too little of other people Little
Ann summed him up in her unsevere reasonable voice Thats so silly

Tembarom tried not to look at her affectionately but his voice was
affectionate as well as admiring despite him

The way you get on to a thing just in three words he said Daniel
Webster aint in it

I dare say if you let the people in the shops know that you come from a
newspaper itll be a help she went on with ingenuous worldly wisdom
Theyll think itll be a kind of advertisement And so it will You get
some neat cards printed with your name and Sunday Earth on them

Gee Tembarom ejaculated slapping his knee theres another You
think of every darned thing dont you

She stopped a moment to look at him

Youd have thought of it all yourself after a bit she said She was
not of those unseemly women whose intention it is manifestly to instruct
the superior man She had been born in a small Manchester street
and trained by her mother whose own training had evolved through
affectionately discreet conjugal management of Mr Hutchinson

Never you let a man feel set down when you want him to see a thing
reasonable Ann she had said You never get on with them if you do
They cant stand it The Almighty seemed to make em that way Theyve
always been masters and it dont hurt any woman to let em be if she
can help em to think reasonable Just you make a man feel comfortable
in his mind and push him the reasonable way But never you shove him
Ann If you do hell just get all upsetlike Me and your father have
been rightdown happy together but we never should have been if I
hadnt thought that out before we was married two weeks Perhaps its
the Almightys will though I never was as sure of the Almightys way of
thinking as some are

Of course Tembarom felt soothed and encouraged though he belonged
to the male development which is not automatically infuriated at a
suspicion of female readiness of logic

Well I might have got on to it in time he answered still trying
not to look affectionate but Ive no time to spare Gee but Im glad
youre here

I shant be here very long There was a shade of patient regret in
her voice Fathers got tired of trying America Hes been disappointed
too often Hes going back to England

Back to England Tembarom cried out forlornly Oh Lord What shall we
all do without you Ann

Youll do as you did before we came said Little Ann

No we shant We cant I cant anyhow He actually got up from
his chair and began to walk about with his hands thrust deep in his
pockets

Little Ann began to put her first stitches into a red B No human being
could have told what she thought

We mustnt waste time talking about that she said Let us talk about
the page There are dressmakers you know If you could make friends
with a dressmaker or two theyd tell you what the wedding things were
really made of Women do like their clothes to be described right




CHAPTER III


His work upon the page began the following week When the first morning
of his campaign opened with a tumultuous blizzard Jim Bowles and Julius
Steinberger privately sympathized with him as they dressed in company
but they heard him whistling in his own hall bedroom as he put on his
clothes and to none of the three did it occur that time could be lost
because the weather was inhuman Blinding snow was being whirled through
the air by a wind which had bellowed across the bay and torn its way
howling through the streets maltreating people as it went snatching
their breath out of them and leaving them gaspingly clutching at hats
and bending their bodies before it Streetcars went by loaded from
front to back platform and were forced from want of room to whizz
heartlessly by groups waiting anxiously at street corners

Tembarom saw two or three of them pass in this way leaving the waiting
ones desperately huddled together behind them He braced himself and
whistled louder as he buttoned his celluloid collar

Im going to get up to Harlem all the same he said The L will be
just as jammed but therell be a place somewhere and Ill get it

His clothes were the outwardly decent ones of a young man who
must perforce seek cheap clothingstores and to whom a tendollar
handmedown is a source of exultant rejoicing With the aid of great
care and a straight wellformed young body he managed to make the
best of them but they were not to be counted upon for warmth even in
ordinarily cold weather His overcoat was a specious covering and was
not infrequently odorous of naphtha

Youve got to know something about first aid to the wounded if you live
on ten per he had said once to Little Ann A suit of clothes gets to
be an emergencycase mighty often if it lasts three years

Going up to Harlem today T T his neighbor at table asked him as
he sat down to breakfast

Right there he answered Ive ordered the limousine round with the
footwarmer and fur rugs

I guess a day wouldnt really matter much said Mrs Bowse
goodnaturedly Perhaps it might be better tomorrow

And perhaps it mightnt said Tembarom eating breakfastfood with
a cheerful appetite What you cant be stonecold sure of tomorrow you
drive a nail in today

He ate a tremendous breakfast as a discreet precautionary measure
The dark diningroom was warm and the food was substantial It was
comfortable in its way

Youd better hold the hall door pretty tight when you go out and dont
open it far said Mrs Bowse as he got up to go Theres wind enough
to upset things

Tembarom went out in the hall and put on his insufficient overcoat He
buttoned it across his chest and turned its collar up to his ears Then
he bent down to turn up the bottoms of his trousers

A pair of arctics would be all to the merry right here he said
and then he stood upright and saw Little Ann coming down the staircase
holding in her hand a particularly ugly tartanplaid woolen neckscarf
of the kind known in England as a comforter

If you are going out in this kind of weather she said in her serene
decided little voice youd better wrap this comforter right round your
neck Mr Tembarom Its one of Fathers and he can spare it because
hes got another and besides hes not going out

Tembarom took it with a sudden emotional perception of the fact that he
was being taken care of in an abnormally luxurious manner

Now I appreciate that he said The thing about you Little Ann is
that you never make a wrong guess about what a fellow needs do you

Im too used to taking care of Father not to see things she answered

What you get on to is how to take care of the whole worldinitials
on a fellows socks and mufflers round his neck His eyes looked
remarkably bright

If a person were taking care of the whole world hed have a lot to
do was her sedate reception of the remark Youd better put that
twice round your neck Mr Tembarom

She put up her hand to draw the end of the scarf over his shoulder
and Tembarom stood still at once as though he were a little boy being
dressed for school He looked down at her round cheek and watched one
of the unexpected dimples reveal itself in a place where dimples are not
usually anticipated It was coming out because she was smiling a small
observing smile It was an almost exciting thing to look at and he
stood very still indeed A fellow who did not own two pairs of boots
would be a fool not to keep quiet

You havent told me I oughtnt to go out till the blizzard lets up he
said presently

No I havent Mr Tembarom she answered Youre one of the kind
that mean to do a thing when theyve made up their minds Itll be a
nice bit of money if you can keep the page

Galton said hed give me a chance to try to make good said Tembarom
And if its the hit he thinks it ought to be hell raise me ten
Thirty per Vanastorbilts wont be in it I think Ill get married he
added showing all his attractive teeth at once

I wouldnt do that she said It wouldnt be enough to depend on New
Yorks an expensive place

She drew back and looked him over Thatll keep you much warmer she
decided Now you can go Ive been looking in the telephonebook for
confectioners and Ive written down these addresses She handed him a
slip of paper

Tembarom caught his breath

Hully gee he exclaimed there never were TWO of you made One used
up all there was of it How am I going to thank you anyhow

I do hope youll be able to keep the page she said I do that Mr
Tembarom

If there had been a touch of coquetry in her earnest sober round
little face she would have been less distractingly alluring but there
was no shade of anything but a sort of softly motherly anxiety in the
dropped note of her voice and it was almost more than flesh and blood
at twentyfive could stand Tembarom made a hasty involuntary
move toward her but it was only a slight one and it was scarcely
perceptible before he had himself in hand and hurriedly twisted his
muffler tighter showing his teeth again cheerily

You keep on hoping it all day without a letup he said And tell Mr
Hutchinson Im obliged to him please Get out of the way Little Ann
while I go out The wind might blow you and the hatstand upstairs

He opened the door and dashed down the high steps into the full blast
of the blizzard He waited at the street corner while three overcrowded
cars whizzed past him ignoring his signals because there was not an
inch of space left in them for another passenger Then he fought his
way across two or three blocks to the nearest L station He managed to
wedge himself into a train there and then at least he was on his way
He was thinking hard and fast but through all his planning the warm hug
of the tartan comforter round his neck kept Little Ann near him He had
been very thankful for the additional warmth as the whirling snow and
wind had wrought their will with him while he waited for the cars at the
street corner On the L train he saw her serious eyes and heard the
motherly drop in her voice as she said I do hope youll be able to
keep the page I do that Mr Tembarom It made him shut his hands hard
as they hung in his overcoat pockets for warmth and it made him shut
his sound teeth strongly

Gee Ive got to his thoughts said for him If I make it perhaps
my luck will have started When a mans luck gets started every darned
things to the good

The L had dropped most of its crowd when it reached the uptown
station among the hundredth streets which was his destination He
tightened his comforter tucked the ends firmly into the front of his
overcoat and started out along the platform past the office and down
the steep iron steps already perilous with freezing snow He had to
stop to get his breath when he reached the street but he did not stop
long He charged forth again along the pavement looking closely at the
shopwindows There were naturally but few passersby and the shops
were not importantlooking but they were open and he could see
that the insides of them looked comfortable in contrast with the
blizzardruled street He could not see both sides of the street as he
walked up one side of the block without coming upon a confectioners
He crossed at the corner and turned back on the other side Presently
he saw that a light van was standing before one place backed up against
the sidewalk to receive parcels its shuddering horse holding its head
down and bracing itself with its forelegs against the wind At any rate
something was going on there and he hurried forward to find out what
it was The air was so thick with myriads of madly flying bits of snow
which seemed whirled in all directions in the air that he could not
see anything definite even a few yards away When he reached the van
he found that he had also reached his confectioner The sign over the
window read M Munsberg Confectionery Cakes IceCream Weddings
Balls and Receptions

Made a start anyhow said Tembarom

He turned into the store opening the door carefully and thereby barely
escaping being blown violently against a stout excited middleaged
little Jew who was bending over a box he was packing This was evidently
Mr Munsberg who was extremely busy and even the modified shock upset
his temper

Vhere you goin he cried out Cant you look vhere youre goin

Tembarom knew this was not a good beginning but his natural mental
habit of vividly seeing the other mans point of view helped him after
its usual custom His nice grin showed itself

I wasnt going I was coming he said Beg pardon The winds blowing
a hundred miles an hour

A goodlooking young woman who was probably Mrs Munsberg was packing
a smaller box behind the counter Tembarom lifted his hat and she liked
it

He didnt do it a bit fresh she said later Kind o nice She spoke
to him with professional politeness

Is there anything you want she asked

Tembarom glanced at the boxes and packages standing about and at
Munsberg who had bent over his packing again Here was an occasion for
practical tact

Ive blown in at the wrong time he said Youre busy getting things
out on time Ill just wait Gee Im glad to be inside I want to
speak to Mr Munsberg

Mr Munsberg jerked himself upright irascibly and broke forth in the
accent of the New York German Jew

If you comin in here to try to sell somedings young man joost you
let that same vind vat blew you in blow you right out pretty quick Im
not buyin nodings Im busy

Im not selling a darned thing answered Tembarom with undismayed
cheer

You vant someding jerked out Munsberg

Yes I want something Tembarom answered but its nothing any one
has to pay for Im only a newspaper man He felt a glow of pride as he
said the words He was a newspaper man even now Dont let me stop you
a minute Im in luck to get inside anywhere and sit down Let me wait

Mrs Munsberg read the Sunday papers and revered them She also knew
the value of advertisement She caught her husbands eye and hurriedly
winked at him

Its awful outside T wont do harm if he waitsif he aint no
agent she put in

See said Tembarom handing over one of the cards which had been
Little Anns businesslike inspiration

T Tembarom New York Sunday Earth read Munsberg rather grudgingly
He looked at T Tembarom and T Tembarom looked back at him The normal
human friendliness in the sharp boyish face did it

Vell he said making another jerk toward a chair if you aint no
agent you can vait

Thank you said Tembarom and sat down He had made another start
anyhow

After this the packing went on fast and furious A youth appeared
from the back of the store and ran here and there as he was ordered
Munsberg and his wife filled wooden and cardboard boxes with small cakes
and larger ones with sandwiches and salads candies and crystallized
fruits Into the larger box was placed a huge cake with an icing temple
on the top of it with silver doves adorning it outside and in There
was no mistaking the poetic significance of that cake Outside the
blizzard whirled clouds of snowparticles through the air and the van
horse kept his head down and his forelegs braced His driver had long
since tried to cover him with a blanket which the wind continually
tore loose from its fastenings and flapped about the creatures sides
Inside the store grew hot There was hurried moving about banging
of doors excited voices irascible orders given and countermanded
Tembarom found out in five minutes that the refreshments were for a
wedding reception to be held at a place known as The Hall and the
goods must be sent out in time to be ready for the preparations for the
wedding supper that night

If I knew how to handle it I could get stuff for a column just sitting
here he thought He kept both eyes and ears open He was sharp enough
to realize that the mere sense of familiarity with detail which he was
gaining was material in itself Once or twice he got up and lent a hand
with a box in his casual way and once or twice he saw that he could
lift something down or up for Mrs Munsberg who was a little woman
The natural casualness of his way of jumping up to do the things
prevented any suspicion of officiousness and also prevented his waiting
figure from beginning to wear the air of a superfluous object in the
way He waited a long time and circumstances so favored him as to give
him a chance or so More than once exactly the right moment presented
itself when he could interject an apposite remark Twice he made
Munsberg laugh and twice Mrs Munsberg voluntarily addressed him

At last the boxes and parcels ware all carried out and stored in the
van after strugglings with the opening and shutting of doors and
battlings with outside weather

When this was all over Munsberg came back into the store knocking his
hands together and out of breath

Dots all right he said Itll all be there plenty time Vouldnt
have fell down on that order for tventyvive dollars Dot temple on the
cake was splendid Joseph he done it fine

He never done nothin no finer Mrs Munsberg said It looked as good
as anything on Fift Avenoo

Both were relieved and pleased with themselves their store and their
cakedecorator Munsberg spoke to Tembarom in the manner of a man who
having done a good thing does not mind talking about it

Dot was a big order he remarked

I should smile answered Tembarom Id like to know whose going to
get outside all that good stuff That weddingcake took the tart away
from anything Ive ever seen Which of the four hundreds going to eat
it

De man vot ordered dot cake Munsberg swaggered hes not got to
vorry along on vun million nor two He owns de biggest brewery in New
York I guess in America Hes Schwartz of Schwartz  Kapfer

Well he s got it to burn said Tembarom

Hes a mighty good man went on Munsberg Hes mighty fond of his
own people He made his first money in Harlem and he had a big fight
to get it but his own people vas good to him an hes never forgot
it Hes built a fine house here an his girls is fine girls De vuns
goin to be married tonight her names Rachel an shes goin to marry
a nice feller Louis Levy Levy built the big entertainmenthall vhere
the receptions goin to be Its decorated vith two thousand dollars
worth of bride roses an lilies of de valley an smilax All de uptown
places vas bought out an den Schwartz vent down Fift Avenoo

The right moment had plainly arrived

Say Mr Munsberg Tembarom broke forth youre giving me just what
I wanted to ask you for Im the new uptown society reporter for the
Sunday Earth and I came in here to see if you wouldnt help me to get a
show at finding out who was going to have weddings and society doings I
didnt know just how to start

Munsberg gave a sort of grunt He looked less amiable

I spose youre used to nothin but Fift Avenoo he said

Tembarom grinned exactly at the right time again Not only his good
teeth grinned but his eyes grinned also if the figure may be used

Fifth Avenue he laughed Theres been no Fifth Avenue in mine Im
not used to anything but you may bet your life Im going to get used
to Harlem if you peoplell let me Ive just got this job and Im dead
stuck on it I want to make it go

Hes mighty different from Biker said Mrs Munsberg in an undertone

Vheres dod oder feller inquired Munsberg He vas a dam fool dot
oder feller half corned most de time an puttin on Clarence airs No
one was goin to give him nothin He made folks mad at de start

Ive got his job said Tembarom and if I cant make it go the
page will be given up Itll be my fault if that happens not Harlems
Theres society enough uptown to make a firstclass page and I shall
be sick if I cant get on to it

He had begun to know his people Munsberg was a goodnatured swaggering
little Hebrew

That the young fellow should make a clean breast of it and claim no
downtown superiority and that he should also have the business insight
to realize that he might obtain valuable society items from such a
representative confectioner as M Munsberg was a situation to incite
amiable sentiments

Vell you didnt come to de wrong place he said All de biggest
things comes to me an I dont mind tellin you about em T aint
goin to do no harm Weddings an things dey ought to be wrote up
anyhow if deyre done right Its good for business Vy dont dey have
no pictures of de suppertables Dotd be good

Theres lots of receptions and weddings this month said Mrs
Munsberg becoming agreeably excited And theres plenty handsome young
girls thatd like their pictures published

None of them have been in Sunday papers before and theyd like it The
four Schwartz girls would make grand pictures They dress splendid and
their bridesmaids dresses came from the biggest place in Fift Avenoo

Say exclaimed Tembarom rising from his chair Im in luck Luck
struck me the minute I turned in here If youll tell me where Schwartz
lives and where the hall is and the church and just anything else
I can use Ill go out and whoop up a page to beat the band He was
glowing with exultation I know I can do it Youve started me off

Munsberg and his wife began to warm It was almost as though they had
charge of the society page themselves There was something stimulating
in the idea There was a suggestion of social importance in it They
knew a number of people who would be pleased with the prospect of being
in the Sunday Earth They were of a race which holds together and they
gave not only the names and addresses of prospective entertainers but
those of florists and owners of halls where parties were given

Mrs Munsberg gave the name of a dressmaker of whom she shrewdly guessed
that she would be amiably ready to talk to a societypage reporter

That Biker feller she said got things down all wrong He called
fine white satin white nunsveiling and he left out things Never
said nothing about Miss Lewishons diamond ring what her grandpa gave
her for a weddingpresent An it cost two hundred and fifty

Well Im a pretty big fool myself said Tembarom but I should have
known better than that

When he opened the door to go Mrs Munsberg called after him

When you get through you come back here and tell us what you done
Ill give you a cup of hot coffee

He returned to Mrs Bowses boardinghouse so late that night that even
Steinberger and Bowles had ended their day The gas in the hall was
turned down to a glimmering point and the house was silent for the
night Even a cat who stole to him and rubbed herself against his leg
miauwed in a sort of abortive whisper opening her mouth wide but
emitting no sound When he went cautiously up the staircase he carried
his damp overcoat with him and hung it in company with the tartan
muffler close to the heater in the upper hall Then he laid on his
bedside table a package of papers and photographs

After he had undressed he dropped heavily into bed exhausted but
elate

Im dogtired he said but I guess Ive got it going And almost
before the last word had uttered itself he fell into the deep sleep of
wornout youth




CHAPTER IV


Mrs Bowses boardinghouse began to be even better pleased with him
than before He had stories to tell festivities to describe and
cheerful incidents to recount The boarders assisted vicariously at
weddings and wedding receptions afternoon teas and dances given in
halls Uptown seemed to them largely given to entertainment and
hilarity of an enviably prodigal sort Mrs Bowses guests were not
of the class which entertains or is entertained and the details
of banquets and balldresses and moneyspending were not uncheering
material for conversation Such topics suggested the presence and
dispensing of a good deal of desirable specie which in floating about
might somehow reach those who needed it most The impression was that
T Tembarom was having a good time It was not his way to relate any
incidents which were not of a cheering or laughterinspiring nature He
said nothing of the times when his luck was bad when he made blunders
and approaching the wrong people was met roughly or grudgingly and
found no resource left but to beat a retreat He made no mention of his
experiences in the blizzard which continued and at times nearly beat
breath and life out of him as he fought his way through it Especially
he told no story of the morning when after having labored furiously
over the writing of his stuff until long after midnight he had taken
it to Galton and seen his face fall as he looked over it To battle all
day with a blizzard and occasional brutal discouragements and to sit
up half the night tensely absorbed in concentrating ones whole mental
equipment upon the doing of unaccustomed work has its effect As he
waited Tembarom unconsciously shifted from one foot to another and had
actually to swallow a sort of lump in his throat

I guess it wont do he said rather uncertainly as Galton laid a sheet
down

Galton was worn out himself and harried by his nerves

No it wont he said and then as he saw Tembarom move to the other
foot he added Not as it is

Tembarom braced himself and cleared his throat

If he venturedwell youve been mighty easy on me Mr
Galtonand this is a big chance for a fellow like me If its too big
a chancewhythats all But if its anything I could change and it
wouldnt be too much trouble to tell me

Theres no time to rewrite it answered Galton It must be handed in
tomorrow Its too flowery Too many adjectives Ive no time to give
you He snatched up a blue pencil and began to slash at the paper
with it Look hereand herecut out that balderdashcut thisand
thisoh throwing the pencil downyoud have to cut it all out
Theres no time He fell back in his chair with a hopeless movement
and rubbed his forehead nervously with the back of his hand Ten people
more or less were waiting to speak to him he was worn out with the rush
of work He believed in the page and did not want to give up his idea
but he didnt know a man to hand it to other than this untrained eager
ignoramus whom he had a queer personal liking for He was no business of
his a mere stenographer in his office with whom he could be expected
to have no relations and yet a curious sort of friendliness verging on
intimacy had developed between them

Thered be time if you thought it wouldnt do any harm to give me
another chance said Tembarom I can sit up all night I guess Ive
caught on to what you DONT want Ive put in too many fool words I got
them out of other papers but I dont know how to use them I guess Ive
caught on Would it do any harm if you gave me till tomorrow

No it wouldnt said Galton desperately If you cant do it
theres no time to find another man and the page must be cut out Its
been no good so far It wont be missed Take it along

As he pushed back the papers he saw the photographs and picked one up

That brides a goodlooking girl Who are these others Bridesmaids
Youve got a lot of stuff here Biker couldnt get anything He
glanced up at the young fellows rather pale face I thought youd make
friends How did you get all this

I beat the streets till I found it said Tembarom I had luck right
away I went into a confectionery store where they make weddingcakes
A goodnatured little Dutchman and his wife kept it and I talked to
them

Got next said Galton grinning a little

They gave me addresses and told me a whole lot of things I got into
the Schwartz wedding reception and they treated me mighty well A good
many of them were willing to talk I told them what a big thing the page
was going to be and Iwell I said the more they helped me the finer
it would turn out I said it seemed a shame there shouldnt be an
uptown page when such swell entertainments were given Ive got a lot
of stuff there

Galton laughed

Youd get it he said If you knew how to handle it youd make it a
hit Well take it along If it isnt right tomorrow its done for

Tembarom didnt tell stories or laugh at dinner that evening He said
he had a headache After dinner he bolted upstairs after Little Ann and
caught her before she mounted to her upper floor

Will you come and save my life again he said Im in the tightest
place I ever was in in my life

Ill do anything I can Mr Tembarom she answered and as his face
had grown flushed by this time she looked anxious You look downright
feverish

Ive got chills as well as fever he said Its the page It seems
like I was going to fall down on it

She turned back at once

No you wont Mr Tembarom she said Im just rightdown sure you
wont

They went down to the parlor again and though there were people in it
they found a corner apart and in less than ten minutes he had told her
what had happened

She took the manuscript he handed to her

If I was well educated I should know how to help you she said but
Ive only been to a common Manchester school I dont know anything
about elegant language What are these pointing to the bluepencil
marks

Tembarom explained and she studied the blue slashes with serious
attention

Well she said in a few minutes laying the manuscript down I should
have cut those words out myself ifif youd asked me which to take
away Theyre too showy Mr Tembarom

Tembarom whipped a pencil out of his pocket and held it out

Say he put it to her would you take this and draw it through a few
of the other showy ones

I should feel as if I was taking too much upon myself she said I
dont know anything about it

You know a darned sight more than I do Tembarom argued I didnt
know they were showy I thought they were the kind you had to put in
newspaper stuff

She held the sheets of paper on her knee and bent her head over them
Tembarom watched her dimples flash in and out as she worked away like a
child correcting an exercise Presently he saw she was quite absorbed
Sometimes she stopped and thought pressing her lips together sometimes
she changed a letter There was no lightness in her manner A badly
mutilated stocking would have claimed her attention in the same way

I think Id put house there instead of mansion if I were you she
suggested once

Put in a whole block of houses if you like he answered gratefully
Whatever you say goes I believe Galton would say the same thing

She went over sheet after sheet and though she knew nothing about it
she cut out just what Galton would have cut out She put the papers
together at last and gave them back to Tembarom getting up from her
seat

I must go back to father now she said I promised to make him a good
cup of coffee over the little oilstove If youll come and knock at the
door Ill give you one It will help you to keep fresh while you work

Tembarom did not go to bed at all that night and he looked rather
fagged the next morning when he handed back the stuff entirely
rewritten He swallowed several times quite hard as he waited for the
final verdict

You did catch on to what I didnt want Galton said at last You will
catch on still more as you get used to the work And you did get the
stuff

Thatyou meanthat goes Tembarom stammered

Yes it goes answered Galton You can turn it in Well try the page
for a month

Gee Thank the Lord said Tembarom and then he laughed an excited
boyish laugh and the blood came back to his face He had a whole month
before him and if he had caught on as soon as this a month would teach
him a lot

Hed work like a dog

He worked like a healthy young man impelled by a huge enthusiasm
and seeing ahead of him something he had had no practical reason for
aspiring to He went out in all weathers and stayed out to all hours
Whatsoever rebuffs or difficulties he met with he never was even on the
verge of losing his nerve He actually enjoyed himself tremendously at
times He made friends people began to like to see him The Munsbergs
regarded him as an inspiration of their own

He seen my name over de store and come in here first time he vas sent
up dis vay to look for tings to write Mr Munsberg always explained
Ve vas awful busytime of the Schwartz vedding an dere vas dat
blizzard He owned up he vas new an vanted some vun vhat knew to tell
him vhat vas goin on Course I could do it Me an my vife give him
addresses an a lot of items He vorked em up good Dot uptown page
is gettin firstrate He says he don know vhat hed have done if he
hadnt turned up here dot day

Tembarom having caught on to his fault of style applied himself with
vigor to elimination He kept his tame dictionary chained to the leg of
his tablean old kitchen table which Mrs Bowse scrubbed and put into
his hall bedroom overcrowding it greatly He turned to Little Ann at
moments of desperate uncertainty but he was man enough to do his work
himself In glorious moments when he was rather sure that Galton was far
from unsatisfied with his progress and Ann had looked more than usually
distracting in her aloof and sober alluringnessit was her entire
aloofness which so stirred his bloodhe sometimes stopped scribbling
and lost his head for a minute or so wondering if a fellow ever COULD
get away with it to the extent of making enough tobut he always
pulled himself up in time

Nice fool I look thinking that way he would say to himself Shed
throw me down hard if she knew But my Lord aint she just a peach

It was in the last week of the month of trial which was to decide the
permanency of the page that he came upon the man Mrs Bowses boarders
called his Freak He never called him a freak himself even at the
first Even his somewhat undeveloped mind felt itself confronted at
the outset with something too abnormal and serious something with a
suggestion of the weird and tragic in it

In this wise it came about

The week had begun with another blizzard which after the second day had
suddenly changed its mind and turned into sleet and rain which filled
the streets with melted snow and made walking a fearsome thing
Tembarom had plenty of walking to do This weeks page was his great
effort and was to be a dandy Galton must be shown what pertinacity
could do

Im going to get into it up to my neck and then strike out he said
at breakfast on Monday morning

Thursday was his most strenuous day The weather had decided to change
again and gusts of sleet were being driven about which added cold to
sloppiness He had found it difficult to get hold of some details he
specially wanted Two important and extremely goodlooking brides had
refused to see him because Biker had enraged them in his day He had
slighted the description of their dresses at a dance where they had been
the observed of all observers and had worn things brought from Paris
Tembarom had gone from house to house He had even searched out
aunts whose favor he had won professionally He had appealed to his
dressmaker whose affection he had by that time fully gained She was
doing work in the brides houses and could make it clear that he would
not call peau de cygne Surah silk nor duchess lace Baby Irish
But the young ladies enjoyed being besought by a society page It was
something to discuss with ones bridesmaids and friends to protest that
those interviewers give a person no peace If you dont want to be in
the papers theyll put you in whether you like it or not however often
you refuse them They kept Tembarom running about they raised faint
hopes and then went out when he called leaving no messages but
allowing the servant to hint that if he went up to Two Hundred and
Seventyfifth Street he might chance to find them

All right said Tembarom to the girl delighting her by lifting his
hat genially as he turned to go down the steps Ill just keep going
The Sunday Earth cant come out without those photographs in it I
should lose my job

When at last he ran the brides to cover it was not at Two Hundred and
Seventyfifth Street but in their own home to which they had finally
returned They had heard from the servantgirl about what the young
gentleman from the Sunday Earth had said and they were mollified by
his proper appreciation of values Tembaroms dressmaker friend also
proffered information

I know him myself she said and hes a real nice gentlemanlike
young man Hes not a bit like Biker He doesnt think he knows
everything He came to me from Mrs Munsberg just to ask me the names
of fashionable materials He said it was more important than a man knew
till he found out Miss Stuntz chuckled

He asked me to lend him some bits of samples so he could learn them
off by heart and know them when he saw them Hes got a pleasant laugh
shows his teeth and theyre real pretty and white and he just laughed
like a boy and said These samples are my alphabet Miss Stuntz Im
going to learn to read words of three syllables in them

When late in the evening Tembarom being let out of the house after his
interview turned down the steps again he carried with him all he had
wantedinformation and photographs even added picturesque details He
was prepared to hand in a fuller and better page than he had ever handed
in before He was in as elated a frame of mind as a young man can
be when he is used up with tramping the streets and running after
streetcars to stand up in them and hang by a strap He had been
wearing a new pair of boots one of which rubbed his heel and had ended
by raising a blister worthy of attention To reach the nearest L
station he must walk across town through several deserted streets in
the first stages of being built up their vacant lots surrounded by high
board fencing covered with huge advertising posters The hall bedroom
with the gas turned up and the cheap redcotton comfort on the bed
made an alluring picture as he faced the sleety wind

If I cut across to the avenue and catch the L Im bound to get there
sometime anyhow he said as he braced himself and set out on his way

The blister on his heel had given him a good deal of trouble and he was
obliged to stop a moment to ease it and he limped when he began to walk
again But he limped as fast as he could while the sleety rain beat
in his face across one street down another for a block or so across
another the melting snow soaking even the new boots as he splashed
through it He bent his head however and limped steadily At this end
of the city many of the streets were only scantily built up and he was
passing through one at the corner of which was a big vacant lot At the
other corner a row of cheap houses which had only reached their second
story waited among piles of bricks and frozen mortar for the return
of the workmen the blizzard had dispersed It was a desolateenough
thoroughfare and not a soul was in sight The vacant lot was fenced
in with high boarding plastered over with flaring sheets advertising
whiskies sauces and theatrical ventures A huge picture of a
dramatically interrupted wedding ceremony done in reds and yellows
and announcing in large letters that Mr Isaac Simonson presented Miss
Evangeline St Clair in Rent Asunder occupied several yards of the
boarding As he reached it the heel of Tembaroms boot pressed as
it seemed to him a redhot coal on the flesh He had rubbed off the
blister He was obliged to stop a moment again

Gee whizz he exclaimed through his teeth I shall have to take my
boot off and try to fix it

To accomplish this he leaned against the boarding and Miss Evangeline
St Clair being Rent Asunder in the midst of the wedding service He
cautiously removed his boot and finding a hole in his sock in the place
where the blister had rubbed off he managed to protect the raw spot by
pulling the sock over it Then he drew on his boot again

Thatll be better he said with a long breath

As he stood on his feet again he started involuntarily This was not
because the blister had hurt him but because he had heard behind him a
startling sound

Whats that broke from him Whats that

He turned and listened feeling his heart give a quick thump In the
darkness of the utterly empty street the thing was unnatural enough
to make any man jump He had heard it between two gusts of wind and
through another he heard it againan uncanny awful sobbing broken by
a hopeless wail of words

I cant remember I cantremember O my God

And it was not a womans voice or a childs it was a mans and there
was an eerie sort of misery in it which made Tembarom feel rather sick
He had never heard a man sobbing before He belonged to a class which
had no time for sobs This sounded ghastly

Good Lord he said the fellows crying A man

The sound came directly behind him There was not a human being in
sight Even policemen do not loiter in empty streets

Hello he cried Where are you

But the low horrible sound went on and no answer came His physical
sense of the presence of the blister was blotted out by the abnormal
thrill of the moment One had to find out about a thing like that one
just had to One could not go on and leave it behind uninvestigated in
the dark and emptiness of a street no one was likely to pass through He
listened more intently Yes it was just behind him

Hes in the lot behind the fence he said How did he get there

He began to walk along the boarding to find a gap A few yards farther
on he came upon a broken place in the inclosurea place where boards
had sagged until they fell down or had perhaps been pulled down by boys
who wanted to get inside He went through it and found lie was in the
usual vacant lot long given up to rubbish When he stood still a moment
he heard the sobbing again and followed the sound to the place behind
the boarding against which he had supported himself when he took off his
boot

A man was lying on the ground with his arms flung out The street lamp
outside the boarding cast light enough to reveal him Tembarom felt as
though he had suddenly found himself taking part in a melodramaThe
Streets of New York for choicethough no melodrama had ever given him
this slightly shaky feeling But when a fellow looked up against it as
hard as this what you had to do was to hold your nerve and make him
feel he was going to be helped The normal human thing spoke loud in
him

Hello old man he said with cheerful awkwardness Whats hit you

The man started and scrambled to his feet as though he were frightened
He was wet unshaven white and shuddering piteous to look at He
stared with wild eyes his chest heaving

Whats up said Tembarom

The mans breath caught itself

I dont remember There was a touch of horror in his voice though he
was evidently making an effort to control himself I cantI cant
remember Whats your name You remember that Tembarom put it to
him

Nnno agonizingly If I could If I could

How did you get in here

I came in because I saw a policeman He wouldnt understand He would
have stopped me I must not be stopped I MUST not

Where were you going asked Tembarom not knowing what else to say

Home My God man home and he fell to shuddering again He put
his arm against the boarding and dropped his head against it The low
hideous sobbing tore him again

T Tembarom could not stand it In his newsboy days he had never been
able to stand starved dogs and homeless cats Mrs Bowse was taking care
of a wretched dog for him at the present moment He had not wanted the
poor brutehe was not particularly fond of dogsbut it had followed
him home and after he had given it a bone or so it had licked its
chops and turned up its eyes at him with such abject appeal that he had
not been able to turn it into the streets again He was unsentimental
but ruled by primitive emotions Also he had a sudden recollection of a
night when as a little fellow he had gone into a vacant lot and cried
as like this as a child could It was a bad night when some tough
big boys had turned him out of a warm corner in a shed and he had had
nowhere to go and being a friendly little fellow the unfriendliness
had hit him hard The boys had not seen him crying but he remembered
it He drew near and put his hand on the shaking shoulder

Say dont do that he said Ill help you to remember

He scarcely knew why he said it There was something in the situation
and in the man himself which was compelling He was not of the tramp
order His wet clothes had been decent and his broken terrified voice
was neither coarse nor nasal He lifted his head and caught Tembaroms
arm clutching it with desperate fingers

Could you he poured forth the words Could you Im not quite mad
Something happened If I could be quiet Dont let them stop me My God
my God my God I cant say it Its not far away but it wont come
back Youre a good fellow if youre human help me help me help me
He clung to Tembarom with hands which shook his eyes were more abject
than the starved dogs he choked and awful tears rolled down his
cheeks Only help me he criedjust help help helpfor a while
Perhaps not long It would come back He made a horrible effort
Listen My nameI amI amits

He was down on the ground again groveling His efforts had failed
Tembarom overwrought himself caught at him and dragged him up

Make a fight he said You cant lie down like that Youve got to
put up a fight Itll come back I tell you it will Youve had a clip
on the head or something Let me call an ambulance and take you to the
hospital

The next moment he was sorry he had said the words the mans terror was
so ill to behold He grew livid with it and uttered a low animal cry

Dont drop dead over it said Tembarom rather losing his head I
wont do it though what in thunder Im going to do with you I dont
know You cant stay here

For Gods sake said the man For Gods sake He put his shaking
hand on Tembarom again and looked at him with a bewildered scrutiny
Im not afraid of you he said I dont know why Theres something
all right about you If youll stand by meyoud stand by a man Id
swear Take me somewhere quiet Let me get warm and think

The less you think now the better answered Tembarom You want a bed
and a bath and a nights rest I guess Ive let myself in for it You
brush off and brace yourself and come with me

There was the hall bedroom and the redcotton comfort for one night
at least and Mrs Bowse was a softhearted woman If shed heard the
fellow sobbing behind the fence shed have been in a worse fix than he
was Women were kinderhearted than men anyhow The way the fellows
voice sounded when he said Help me help me help me sounded as
though he was in hell Made me feel as if I was bracing up a chap that
was going to be electrocuted he thought feeling sickish again Ive
not got backbone enough to face that sort of thing Got to take him
somewhere

They were walking toward the L together and he was wondering what he
should say to Mrs Bowse when he saw his companion fumbling under his
coat at the back as though he was in search of something His hands
being unsteady it took him some moments to get at what he wanted
He evidently had a belt or a hidden pocket He got something out and
stopped under a street light to show it to Tembarom His hands still
shook when he held them out and his look was a curious puzzled
questioning one What he passed over to Tembarom was a roll of
money Tembarom rather lost his breath as he saw the number on two
fivehundreddollar bills and of several hundreds besides twenties
tens and fives

Take itkeep it he said It will pay

Hully gee cried Tembarom aghast Dont go giving away your whole
pile to the first fellow you meet I dont want it

Take it The stranger put his hand on his shoulder the abject look in
his eyes harrowingly like the starved dogs again

Theres something all right about you Youll help me

If I dont take it for you some one will knock you upon the head for
it Tembarom hesitated but the next instant he stuffed it all in his
pocket incited thereto by the sound of a whizzing roar

Theres the L coming he cried run for all youre worth And they
fled up the street and up the steps and caught it without a second to
spare




CHAPTER V


At about the time Tembarom made his rush to catch the L Joseph
Hutchinson was passing through one of his periodical fits of infuriated
discouragement Little Ann knew they would occur every two or three
days and she did not wonder at them Also she knew that if she merely
sat still and listened as she sewed she would be doing exactly what
her mother would have done and what her father would find a sort of
irritated comfort in There was no use in citing peoples villainies and
calling them names unless you had an audience who would seem to agree to
the justice of your accusations

So Mr Hutchinson charged up and down the room his face red and his
hands thrust in his coat pockets He was giving his opinions of America
and Americans and he spoke with his broadest Manchester accent
and threw in now and then a word or so of Lancashire dialect to add
roughness and strength the angrier a Manchester man being the broader
and therefore the more forcible his accent Tha is somehow a great
deal more bitter or humorous or affectionate than the mere ordinary
You or Yours

Merica he belloweddang Merica I saysan dang Mericans Goin
about th world braggin an boastin about their sharpness an their
openandedness Go to Merica folksll tell you with an invention
and theres dozens of millionaires ready to put money in it Fools

Now FatherLittle Anns voice was as maternal as her mothers had
beennow Father love dont work yourself up into a passion You
know its not good for you

I dont need to work myself up into one Im in one A man sells
everything he owns to get to Merica an when he gets there what does
he find He canna get near a millionaire Hes pushed here an scuffled
there an told this chap cant see him an that chap isnt interested
an he must wait his chance to catch this one An he waits an waits
an goes up in elevators an stands on one leg in lobbies till hes
broke down an sick of it an has to go home to England steerage

Little Ann looked up from her sewing He had been walking furiously for
half an hour and had been tired to begin with She had heard his voice
break roughly as he said the last words He threw himself astride a
chair and crossing his arms on the back of it dropped his head on
them Her mother never allowed this Her idea was that women were made
to tide over such moments for the weaker sex Far had it been from the
mind of Mrs Hutchinson to call it weaker But theres times Ann when
just for a bit theyre just like children They need comforting without
being let to know they are being comforted You know how it is when your
back aches and some one just slips a pillow under it in the right place
without saying anything Thats what women can do if theyve got heads
It needs a head

Little Ann got up and went to the chair She began to run her fingers
caressingly through the thick grizzled hair

There Father love there she said We are going back to England
at any rate arent we And grandmother will be so glad to have us with
her in her cottage And Americas only one place

I tried it first dang it jerked out Hutchinson Every one told me
to do it He quoted again with derisive scorn You go to Merica
Mericas the place for a chap like you Mericas the place for
inventions Liars

Little Ann went on rubbing the grizzled head lovingly

Well now were going back to try England You never did really try
England And you know how beautiful itll be in the country with the
primroses in bloom and the young lambs in the fields The caressing
hand grew even softer And youre not going to forget how mother
believed in the invention you cant do that

Hutchinson lifted his head and looked at her

Eh Ann he said you are a comfortable little body Youve got a way
with you just like your poor mother had You always say the right thing
to help a chap pull himself together Your mother did believe in it
didnt she

She had indeed believed in it though her faith was founded more upon
confidence in Mr Hutchinson than in any profound knowledge of the
mechanical appliance his inspiration would supply She knew it had
something important to do with locomotive engines and she knew that if
railroad magnates would condescend to consider it her husband was sure
that fortune would flow in She had lived with the invention as it
was respectfully called for years

That she did answered Little Ann And before she died she said to
me Little Ann she said theres one thing you must never let your
father do You must never let him begin not to believe in his invention
Your fathers a clever man and its a clever invention and itll make
his fortune yet You must remind him how I believed in it and how sure I
was

Hutchinson rubbed his hands thoughtfully He had heard this before but
it did him good to hear it again

She said that did she he found vague comfort in saying She said
that

Yes she did Father It was the very day before she died

Well she never said anything she hadnt thought out he said in
slow retrospection And she had a good head of her own Eh she was
a wonderful woman she was for sticking to things That was th
Lancashire in her Lancashire folks knows their own minds

Mother knew hers said Ann And she always said you knew yours Come
and sit in your own chair Father and have your paper

She had tided him past the worst currents without letting him slip into
them

I like folks that knows their own minds he said as he sat down and
took his paper from her You know yours Ann and theres that Tembarom
chap He knows his Ive been noticing that chap There was a certain
pleasure in using a tone of amiable patronage Hes got a way with him
thats worth money to him in business if he only knew it

I dont think he knows hes got a way Little Ann said His way is
just him

He just gets over people with it like he got over me I was ready
to knock his head off first time he spoke to me I was ready to knock
anybodys head off that day Id just had that letter from Hadman
He made me sick wi the way he pottered an played the fool about the
invention He believed in it right enough but he hadnt the courage
of a mouse He wasnt goin to be the first one to risk his money Him
with all he has Hes the very chap to be able to set it goin If I
could have got some one else to put up brass itd have started him
Its want o backbone thats the matter wi Hadman an his lot

Some of these days some of them re going to get their eyes open
said Little Ann and then the others will be sorry Mr Tembarom says
theyll fall over themselves to get in on the ground floor

Hutchinson chuckled

Thats New York he said Hes a rum chap But he thinks a good bit
of the invention Ive talked it over with him because Ive wanted to
talk and the one thing Ive noticed about Tembarom is that he can keep
his mouth shut

But he talks a good deal said Ann

Thats the best of it Youd think he was telling all he knows and
hes not by a fat lot He tells you what youll like to hear and hes
not sly but he can keep a shut mouth Thats Lancashire Some folks
cant do it even when they want to

His father came from England

Thats where the lads sense comes from Perhaps hes Lancashire He
had a lot of good ideas about the way to get at Hadman

A knock at the door broke in upon them Mrs Bowse presented herself
wearing a novel expression on her face It was at once puzzled and not
altogether disagreeably excited

I wish you would come down into the diningroom Little Ann She
hesitated Mr Tembarons brought home such a queer man He picked
him up ill in the street He wants me to let him stay with him for
the night anyhow I dont think hes crazy but I guess hes lost
his memory Queerest thing I ever saw He doesnt know his name or
anything

See here broke out Hutchinson dropping his hands and his paper
on his knee Im not going to have Ann goin down stairs to quiet
lunatics

Hes as quiet as a child Mrs Bowse protested Theres something
pitiful about him he seems so frightened Hes drenched to the skin

Call an ambulance and send him to the hospital advised Hutchinson

Thats what Mr Tembarom says he cant do It frightens him to death
to speak of it He just clings to Mr Tembarom sort of awful as if he
thinks hell save his life But that isnt all she added in an amazed
tone hes given Mr Tembarom more than two thousand dollars

What shouted Hutchinson bounding to his feet quite unconsciously

What exclaimed Little Ann

Just you come and look at it answered Mrs Bowse nodding her head
Theres over two thousand dollars in bills spread out on the table in
the diningroom this minute He had it in a belt pocket and he dragged
it out in the street and would make Mr Tembarom take it Do come and
tell us what to do

Id get him to take off his wet clothes and get into bed and drink
some hot spirits and water first said Little Ann Wouldnt you Mrs
Bowse

Hutchinson got up newspaper in hand

I say Id like to go down and have a look at that chap myself he
announced

If hes so frightened perhaps Little Ann hesitated

Thats it put in Mrs Bowse Hes so nervous itd make him worse to
see another man Youd better wait Mr Hutchinson

Hutchinson sat down rather grumpily and Mrs Bowse and Little Ann went
down the stairs together

I feel real nervous myself said Mrs Bowse its so queer But hes
not crazy Hes quiet enough

As they neared the bottom of the staircase Little Ann could see over
the balustrade into the diningroom The strange man was sitting by the
table his disordered blackhaired head on his arm He looked like
an exhausted thing Tembarom was sitting by him and was talking in an
encouraging voice He had laid a hand on one of the strangers On the
table beside them was spread a number of bills which had evidently just
been counted

Heres the ladies said Tembarom

The stranger lifted his head and having looked rose and stood upright
waiting It was the involuntary mechanical action of a man who had been
trained among gentlemen

Its Mrs Bowse again and shes brought Miss Hutchinson down with
her Miss Hutchinson always knows what to do explained Tembarom in his
friendly voice

The man bowed and his bewildered eyes fixed themselves on Little Ann

Thank you he said Its very kind of you II amin great
trouble

Little Ann went to him and smiled her motherly smile at him

Youre very wet she said Youll take a bad cold if youre not
careful Mrs Bowse thinks you ought to go right to bed and have
something hot to drink

It seems a long time since I was in bed he answered her

Im very tired Thank you He drew a weary sighing breath but he
didnt move his eyes from the girls face Perhaps the cessation of
action in certain cells of his brain had increased action in others
He looked as though he were seeing something in Little Anns face which
might not have revealed itself so clearly to the more normal gaze

He moved slightly nearer to her He was a tall man and had to look down
at her

What is your name he asked anxiously Names trouble me

It was Ann who drew a little nearer to him now She had to look up and
the soft absorbed kindness in her eyes might Tembarom thought have
soothed a raging lion it was so intent on its purpose

My name is Ann Hutchinson but never you mind about it now she said
Ill tell it to you again Let Mr Tembarom take you upstairs to bed
Youll be better in the morning And because his hollow eyes rested on
her so fixedly she put her hand on his wet sleeve

Youre wet through she said That wont do

He looked down at her hand and then at her face again

Help me he pleaded just help me I dont know whats happened Have
I gone mad

No she answered not a bit Itll all come right after a while
youll see

Will it will it he begged and then suddenly his eyes were full of
tears It was a strange thing to see him in his bewildered misery try
to pull himself together and bite his shaking lips as though he vaguely
remembered that he was a man I beg pardon he faltered I suppose
Im ill

I dont know where to put him Mrs Bowse was saying half aside Ive
not got a room empty

Put him in my bed and give me a shakedown on the floor said
Tembarom Thatll be all right He doesnt want me to leave him
anyhow

He turned to the money on the table

Say he said to his guest theres two thousand five hundred dollars
here Weve counted it to make sure Thats quite some money And its
yours

The stranger looked disturbed and made a nervous gesture

Dont dont he broke in Keep it Some one took the rest This was
hidden It will pay

You see he isnt real out of his mind Mrs Bowse murmured feelingly

No not real out of it said Tembarom Sayas an inspiration
occurred to himI guess maybe Miss Hutchinson will keep it Will you
Little Ann You can give it to him when he wants it

Its a good bit of money said Little Ann soberly but I can put it
in a bank and pay Mrs Bowse his board every week Yes Ill take it
Now he must go to bed Its a comfortable little room she said to the
stranger and Mrs Bowse will make you a hot milkpunch Thatll be
nourishing

Thank you murmured the man still keeping his yearning eyes on her
Thank you

So he was taken up to the fourth floor and put into Tembaroms bed The
hot milkpunch seemed to take the chill out of him and when by lying
on his pillow and gazing at the shakedown on the floor as long as he
could keep his eyes open he had convinced himself that Tembarom was
going to stay with him he fell asleep

Little Ann went back to her father carrying a roll of bills in her
hands It was a roll of such size that Hutchinson started up in his
chair and stared at the sight of it

Is that the money he exclaimed What are you going to do with it
What have you found out lass

Yes this is it she answered Mr Tembarom asked me to take care of
it Im going to put it in the bank But we havent found out anything




CHAPTER VI


His was the opening incident of the series of extraordinary and
altogether incongruous events which took place afterwards as it
appeared to T Tembarom like scenes in a play in which he had become
involved in a manner which one might be inclined to regard humorously
and make jokes about because it was a thousand miles away from anything
like real life That was the way it struck him The events referred to
it was true were things one now and then read about in newspapers but
while the world realized that they were actual occurrences one rather
regarded them when their parallels were reproduced in books and plays
as belonging alone to the world of pure and highly romantic fiction

I guess the reason why it seems that way he summed it up to
Hutchinson and Little Ann after the worst had come to the worst is
because weve not only never known any one its happened to but weve
never known any one thats known any one its happened to Ive got to
own up that it makes me feel as if the fellowsd just yell right out
laughing when they heard it

The strangers money had been safely deposited in a bank and the
stranger himself still occupied Tembaroms bedroom He slept a great
deal and was very quiet With great difficulty Little Ann had persuaded
him to let a doctor see him and the doctor had been much interested
in his case He had expected to find some signs of his having received
accidentally or otherwise a blow upon the head but on examination
he found no scar or wound The condition he was in was frequently the
result of concussion of the brain sometimes of prolonged nervous strain
or harrowing mental shock Such cases occurred not infrequently Quiet
and entire freedom from excitement would do more for such a condition
than anything else If he was afraid of strangers by all means keep
them from him Tembarom had been quite right in letting him think he
would help him to remember and that somehow he would in the end reach
the place he had evidently set out to go to Nothing must be allowed to
excite him It was well he had had money on his person and that he had
fallen into friendly hands A city hospital would not have been likely
to help him greatly The restraint of its necessary discipline might
have alarmed him

So long as he was persuaded that Tembarom was not going to desert
him he was comparatively calm though sunk in a piteous and tormented
melancholy His worst hours were when he sat alone in the hall bedroom
with his face buried in his hands He would so sit without moving or
speaking and Little Ann discovered that at these times he was trying
to remember Sometimes he would suddenly rise and walk about the little
room muttering with woe in his eyes Ann who saw how hard this was
for him found also that to attempt to check or distract him was even
worse When sitting in her fathers room which was on the other side
of the wall she heard his fretted hurried pacing feet her face lost
its dimpled cheerfulness She wondered if her mother would not have
discovered some way of clearing the black cloud distracting his brain
Nothing would induce him to go down to the boarders diningroom for
his meals and the sight of a servant alarmed him so that it was Ann
who took him the scant food he would eat As the time of her return to
England with her father drew near she wondered what Mr Tembarom would
do without her services It was she who suggested that they must have
a name for him and the name of a part of Manchester had provided one
There was a place called Strangeways and one night when in talking
to her father she referred to it in Tembaroms presence he suddenly
seized upon it

Strangeways he said Thatd make a goodenough name for him Lets
call him Mr Strangeways I dont like the way the fellows have of
calling him the Freak

So the name had been adopted and soon became an established fact

The way I feel about him Tembarom said is that the fellows not
a bit of a joke What I see is that hes up against about the toughest
proposition Ive ever known Gee that fellows not crazy Hes worse
If he was outandout dippy and didnt know it hed be all right
Likely as not hed be thinking he was the Pope of Rome or Anna Held
What knocks him out is that hes just right enough to know hes wrong
and to be trying to get back He reminds me of one of those chaps the
papers tell about sometimesfellows that go to work in liverystables
for ten years and call themselves Bill Jones and then wake up some
morning and remember theyre some highbrowed minister of the gospel
named the Rev James Cadwallader

When the curtain drew up on Tembaroms amazing drama Strangeways had
been occupying his bed nearly three weeks and he himself had been
sleeping on a cot Mrs Bowse had put up for him in his room The
Hutchinsons were on the point of sailing for Englandsteerageon the
steamship Transatlantic and Tembarom was secretly torn into fragments
though he had done well with the page and he was daring to believe that
at the end of the month Galton would tell him he had made good and the
work would continue indefinitely

If that happened he would be raised to twentyfive per and would be a
man of means If the Hutchinsons had not been going away he would have
been floating in clouds of rose color If he could persuade Little
Ann to take him in hand when shed had time to try him out even
Hutchinson could not utterly flout a fellow who was making his steady
twentyfive per on a big paper and was on such terms with his boss
that he might get other chances Gee but he was a fellow that luck just
seemed to chase anyhow Look at the other chaps lots of em who
knew twice as much as he did and had lived in decent homes and gone to
school and done their darned best too and then hadnt been able to
get there It didnt seem fair somehow that he should run into such pure
luck

The day arrived when Galton was to give his decision Tembarom was going
to hand in his page and while he was naturally a trifle nervous his
nervousness would have been a hopeful and not unpleasant thing but that
the Transatlantic sailed in two days and in the Hutchinsons rooms
Little Ann was packing her small trunk and her fathers bigger one
which held more models and drawings than clothing Hutchinson was
redder in the face than usual and indignant condemnation of America
and American millionaires possessed his soul Everybody was rather
depressed One boarder after another had wakened to a realization that
with the passing of Little Ann Mrs Bowses establishment even with
the parlor the cozycorner and the secondhand pianola to support
it would be a desertedseeming thing Mrs Bowse felt the tone of
low spirits about the table and even had a horrible secret fear that
certain of her best boarders might decide to go elsewhere merely to
change surroundings from which they missed something Her eyes were a
little red and she made great efforts to keep things going

I can only keep the place up when Ive no empty rooms she had said to
Mrs Peck but Id have boarded her free if her father would have let
her stay But he wouldnt and anyway shed no more let him go off
alone than shed jump off Brooklyn Bridge

It had been arranged that partly as a farewell banquet and partly to
celebrate Galtons decision about the page there was to be an oyster
stew that night in Mr Hutchinsons room which was distinguished as
a bedsittingroom Tembarom had diplomatically suggested it to Mr
Hutchinson It was to be Tembaroms oyster supper and somehow he
managed to convey that it was only a proper and modest tribute to Mr
Hutchinson himself Firstclass oyster stew and pale ale were not so bad
when properly suggested therefore Mr Hutchinson consented Jim Bowles
and Julius Steinberger were to come in to share the feast and Mrs
Bowse had promised to prepare

It was not an inspiring day for Little Ann New York had seemed a
bewildering and far too noisy place for her when she had come to it
directly from her grandmothers cottage in the English village where
she had spent her last three months before leaving England The dark
rooms of the fivestoried boardinghouse had seemed gloomy enough to
her and she had found it much more difficult to adjust herself to her
surroundings than she could have been induced to admit to her father
At first his temper and the open contempt for American habits and
institutions which he called speaking his mind had given her a
great deal of careful steering through shoals to do At the outset the
boarders had resented him and sometimes had snapped back their own
views of England and courts Violent and disparaging argument had
occasionally been imminent and Mrs Bowse had worn an ominous look
Their rooms had in fact been wanted before their first week had come
to an end and Little Ann herself scarcely knew how she had tided over
that situation But tide it over she did and by supernatural effort and
watchfulness she contrived to soothe Mrs Bowse until she had been in
the house long enough to make friends with people and aid her father
to realize that if they went elsewhere they might find only the same
class of boarders and there would be the cost of moving to consider
She had beguiled an armchair from Mrs Bowse and had recovered it
herself with a remnant of crimson stuff secured from a miscellaneous
heap at a markeddown sale at a department store She had arranged his
books and papers adroitly and had kept them in their places so that
he never felt himself obliged to search for any one of them With many
little contrivances she had given his bedsittingroom a look of comfort
and established homeliness and he had even begun to like it

That just like tha mother Ann he had said Shed make a railway
station look as if it had been lived in

Then Tembarom had appeared heralded by Mrs Bowse and the G Destroyer
and the first time their eyes had met across the table she had liked
him The liking had increased There was that in his boyish cheer and
his nottoowellfedlooking face which called forth maternal interest
As she gradually learned what his life had been she felt a thrilled
anxiety to hear day by day how he was getting on She listened for
details and felt it necessary to gather herself together in the face of
a slight depression when hopes of Galton were less high than usual His
mending was mysteriously done and in time he knew with amazed gratitude
that he was being looked after His first thanks were so awkward but
so full of appreciation of unaccustomed luxury that they almost brought
tears to her eyes since they so clearly illuminated the entire novelty
of any attention whatever

I just dont know what to say he said shuffling from one foot to
another though his nice grin was at its best Ive never had a woman
do anything for me since I was ten I guess women do lots of things
for most fellows but then theyre mothers and sisters and aunts I
appreciate it likelike thunder I feel as if I was Rockefeller Miss
Ann

In a short time she had become Little Ann to him as to the rest
and they began to know each other very well Jim Bowles and Julius
Steinberger had not been able to restrain themselves at first from
making slangy yearning love to her but Tembarom had been different
He had kept himself well in hand Yes she had liked T Tembarom and
as she packed the trunks she realized that the Atlantic Ocean was
three thousand miles across and when two people who had no money
were separated by it they were likely to remain so Rich people could
travel poor people couldnt You just stayed where things took you and
you mustnt be silly enough to expect things to happen in your class of
lifethings like seeing people again Your life just went on She kept
herself very busy and did not allow her thoughts any latitude It would
vex her father very much if he thought she had really grown fond of
America and was rather sorry to go away She had finished her packing
before evening and the trunks were labeled and set aside some in the
outside hall and some in the corner of the room She had sat down with
some mending on her lap and Hutchinson was walking about the room with
the restlessness of the traveler whose approaching journey will not let
him settle himself anywhere

Ill lay a shilling youve got everything packed and ready and put
just where a chap can lay his hands on it he said

Yes Father Your tweed caps in the big pocket of your thick topcoat
and theres an extra pair of spectacles and your pipe and tobacco in the
small one

And off we go back to England same as we came He rubbed his head and
drew a big worried sigh Wheres them going he asked pointing to
some newly laundered clothing on a side table You havent forgotten
em have you

No Father Its just some of the young mens washing I thought Id
take time to mend them up a bit before I went to bed

Thats like tha mother tootaking care of everybody What did these
chaps do before you came

Sometimes they tried to sew on a button or so themselves but oftener
they went without Men make poor work of sewing It oughtnt to be
expected of them

Hutchinson stopped and looked her and her mending over with a touch of
curiosity

Some of thems Tembaroms he asked

Little Ann held up a pair of socks

These are He does wear them out poor fellow Its tramping up and
down the streets to save carfare does it Hes never got a heel to his
name But hes going to be able to buy some new ones next week

Hutchinson began his tramp again

Hell miss thee Little Ann but soll the other lads for that
matter

Hell know tonight whether Mr Galtons going to let him keep his
work I do hope he will I believe hed begin to get on

WellHutchinson was just a little grudging even at this
comparatively lenient momentI believe the chapll get on myself
Hes got pluck and hes sharp I never saw him make a poor mouth yet

Neither did I answered Ann

A door leading into Tembaroms hall bedroom opened on to Hutchinsons
They both heard some one inside the room knock at it Hutchinson turned
and listened jerking his head toward the sound

Theres that poor chap again he said Hes wakened and got restless
Whats Tembarom going to do with him Id like to know The money wont
last forever

Shall I let him in Father I dare say hes got restless because Mr
Tembaroms not come in

Aye well let him in He wont have thee long He cant do no harm so
long as Im here

Little Ann went to the door and opened it She spoke quietly

Do you want to come in here Mr Strangeways

The man came in He was clean but still unshaven and his clothes
looked as though he had been lying down He looked round the room
anxiously

Where has he gone he demanded in an overstrung voice Where is he
He caught at Anns sleeve in a sudden access of nervous fear What
shall I do if hes gone

Hutchinson moved toward him

Ere ere he said dont you go catchin hold of ladies What do
you want

Ive forgotten his name now What shall I do if I cant remember
faltered Strangeways

Little Ann patted his arm comfortingly

There there now Youve not really forgotten it Its just slipped
your memory You want Mr TembaromMr T Tembarom

Oh thank you thank you Thats it Yes Tembarom He said T
Tembarom He said he wouldnt throw me over

Little Ann led him to a seat and made him sit down She answered him
with quiet decision

Well if he said he wouldnt he wont Will he Father

No he wont There was rough good nature in Hutchinsons admission
He paused after it to glance at Ann You think a lot of that lad dont
you Ann

Yes I do Father she replied undisturbedly Hes one you can trust
too Hes uptown at his work she explained to Strangeways Hell be
back before long Hes giving us a bit of a supper in here because were
going away

Strangeways grew nervous again

But he wont go with you T Tembarom wont go

No no hes not going Hell stay here she said soothingly He had
evidently not observed the packed and labeled trunks when he came in He
seemed suddenly to see them now and rose in distress

Whose are these You said he wasnt going

Ann took hold of his arm and led him to the corner

They are not Mr Tembaroms trunks she explained They are fathers
and mine Look on the labels Joseph Hutchinson Liverpool Ann
Hutchinson Liverpool

He looked at them closely in a puzzled way He read a label aloud in a
dragging voice

Ann Hutchinson Liverpool Whatswhats Liverpool

Oh come encouraged Little Ann you know that Its a place in
England Were going back to England

He stood and gazed fixedly before him Then he began to rub his fingers
across his forehead Ann knew the straining look in his eyes He was
making that horrible struggle to get back somewhere through the darkness
which shut him in It was so painful a thing to see that even Hutchinson
turned slightly away

Dont said Little Ann softly and tried to draw him away

He caught his breath convulsively once or twice and his voice dragged
out words again as though he were dragging them from bottomless depths

GoingbacktoEnglandback to Englandto England

He dropped into a chair near by his arms thrown over its back and
broke as his face fell upon them into heavy deadly sobbingthe
kind of sobbing Tembarom had found it impossible to stand up against
Hutchinson whirled about testily

Dang it he broke out I wish Tembaromd turn up What are we to do
He didnt like it himself It struck him as unseemly

But Ann went to the chair and put her hands on the shuddering shoulder
bending over the soulwrung creature the wisdom of centuries in the
soft expostulatory voice which seemed to reach the very darkness he
was lost in It was a wisdom of which she was wholly unaware but it had
been born with her and was the building of her being

Sh Shh she said You mustnt do that Mr Tembarom wouldnt
like you to do it Hell be in directly Sh Sh now And simple as
the words were their soothing reached him The wildness of his sobs
grew less

See here Hutchinson protested this wont do my man I wont have
it Ann Im upset myself what with this going back and everything I
cant have a chap coming and crying like that there It upsets me worse
than ever And you hangin over him It wont do

Strangeways lifted his head from his arms and looked at him

Aye I mean what I say Hutchinson added fretfully

Strangeways got up from the chair When he was not bowed or slouching it
was to be seen that he was a tall man with square shoulders Despite his
unshaven haggard face he had a sort of presence

Ill go back to my room he said I forgot I ought not to be here

Neither Hutchinson nor Little Ann had ever seen any one do the thing
he did next When Ann went with him to the door of the hall bedroom he
took her hand and bowing low before her lifted it gently to his lips

Hutchinson stared at him as he turned into the room and closed the door
behind him

Well Ive read of lords and ladies doin that in books he said but
I never thought I should see a chap do it myself

Little Ann went back to her mending looking very thoughtful

Father she said after a few moments England made him come near to
remembering something

New Yorkll come near making me remember a lot of things when Im
out of it said Mr Hutchinson sitting down heavily in his chair and
rubbing his head Eh dang it dang it

Dont you let it Father advised Little Ann Theres never any good
in thinking things over

Youre not as cheerful yourself as you let on he said Youve not
got much color today my lass

She rubbed one cheek a little trying to laugh

I shall get it back when we go and stay with grandmother Its just
staying indoors so much Mr Tembarom wont be long now Ill get up and
set the table The things are on a tray outside

As she was going out of the room Jim Bowles and Julius Steinberger
appeared at the door

May we come in Jim asked eagerly Were invited to the oyster stew
and its time old T T was here Julius and me are just getting dippy
waiting upstairs to hear if hes made good with Galton

Well now you sit down and be quiet a bit or youll be losing your
appetites advised Ann

You cant lose a thing the size of mine answered Jim any more than
you could lose the Metropolitan Operahouse

Ann turned her head and paused as though she were listening She heard
footsteps in the lower hall

Hes coming now she announced I know his step Hes tired Dont go
yet you two she added as the pair prepared to rush to meet him
When any ones that tired he wants to wash his face and talk when hes
ready If youll just go back to your room Ill call you when Ive set
the table

She felt that she wanted a little more quiet during the next few minutes
than she could have if they remained and talked at the top of elated
voices She had not quite realized how anxiously she had been waiting
all day for the hour when she would hear exactly what had happened If
he was all right it would be a nice thing to remember when she was in
England In this moderate form she expressed herself mentally It would
be a nice thing to remember She spread the cloth on the table and
began to lay out the plates Involuntarily she found herself stopping to
glance at the hall bedroom door and listen rather intently

I hope hes got it I do that Im sure he has He ought to

Hutchinson looked over at her She was that like her mother that lass

Youre excited Ann he said

Yes Father I ama bit Heshes washing his face now Sounds of
splashing water could be heard through the intervening door

Hutchinson watched her with some uneasiness

You care a lot for that lad he said

She did not look fluttered Her answer was quite candid

I said I did Father Hes taking off his boots

You know every sound he makes and youre going away Saturday and
youll never see him again

That neednt stop me caring It never did any one any harm to care for
one of his sort

But it cant come to anything Hutchinson began to bluster It wont
do

Hes coming to the door hes turning the handle said Little Ann

Tembarom came in He was fresh with recent facewashing and his hair
was damp so that a short lock curled and stood up He had been uptown
making frantic efforts for hours but he had been making them in a
spirit of victorious relief and he did not look tired at all

Ive got it he cried out the moment he entered Ive got it by
jingo The jobs mine for keeps

Galtons give it to you out and out Hutchinson was slightly excited
himself

Hes in the bulliest humor you ever saw He says Ive done firstrate
and if I go on hell run me up to thirty

Well Im danged glad of it lad that I am Hutchinson gave in
handsomely You put backbone into it

Little Ann stood near smiling Her smile met Tembaroms

I know youre glad Little Ann he said Id never have got there but
for you It was up to me after the way you started me

You know Im glad without me telling you she answered Im RIGHTDOWN
glad

And it was at this moment that Mrs Bowse came into the room

Its too bad its happened just now she said much flustered
Thats the way with things The stewll spoil but he says its real
important

Tembarom caught at both her hands and shook them

Ive got it Mrs Bowse Heres your society reporter The bestlooking
boarder youve got is going to be able to pay his board steady

Im as glad as can be and so will everybody be I knew youd get it
But this gentlemans been here twice today He says he really must see
you

Let him wait Hutchinson ordered Whats the chap want The stew
wont be fit to eat

No it wont answered Mrs Bowse but he seems to think hes not the
kind to be put off He says its more Mr Tembaroms business than his
He looked real mad when I showed him into the parlor where they were
playing the pianola He asked wasnt there a private room where you
could talk

A certain flurried interest in the manner of Mrs Bowse a something
not usually awakened by inopportune callers an actual suggestion of
the possible fact that she was not as indifferent as she was nervous
somewhat awakened Mr Hutchinsons curiosity

Look here he volunteered if hes got any real business he
cant talk over to the tune of the pianola you can bring him up here
Tembarom Ill see he dont stay long if his business isnt worth
talkin about Hell see the table set for supper and thatll hurry
him

Oh gee I wish he hadnt come said Tembarom Ill just go down and
see what he wants No ones got any swell private business with me

You bring him up if he has said Hutchinson Wed like to hear about
it

Tembarom ran down the stairs quickly

No one had ever wanted to see him on business before There was
something importantsounding about it perhaps things were starting up
for him in real earnest It might be a message from Galton though
he could not believe that he had at this early stage reached such a
distinction A ghastly thought shot a bolt at him but he shook himself
free of it

Hes not a fellow to go back on his word anyhow he insisted

There were more boarders than usual in the parlor The young woman from
the notion counter had company and one of her guests was playing He
sutnly was Good to Me on the pianola with loud and steady tread of
pedal

The new arrival had evidently not thought it worth his while to commit
himself to permanency by taking a seat He was standing not far from the
door with a businesslikelooking envelop in one hand and a pincenez in
the other with which Tembarom saw he was rather fretfully tapping
the envelop as he looked about him He was plainly taking in the
characteristics of the room and was not leniently disposed toward them
His tailor was clearly an excellent one with entirely correct ideas as
to the cut and material which exactly befitted an elderly gentleman of
some impressiveness in the position whatsoever it happened to be which
he held His face was not of a friendly type and his eyes held cold
irritation discreetly restrained by businesslike civility Tembarom
vaguely felt the genialities of the oyster supper assume a rather
fourthrate air

The caller advanced and spoke first

Mr Tembarom he inquired

Yes Tembarom answered Im T Tembarom

T repeated the stranger with a slightly puzzled expression Ah
yes I see I beg pardon

In that moment Tembarom felt that he was looked over taken in summed
up and without favor The sharp steady eye however did not seem to
have moved from his face At the same time it had aided him to realize
that he was to this welldressed person at least a too exhilarated
young man wearing a tendollar handmedown

My name is Palford he said concisely That will convey nothing to
you I am of the firm of Palford  Grimby of Lincolns Inn This is my
card

Tembarom took the card and read that Palford  Grimby were solicitors
and he was not sure that he knew exactly what solicitors were

Lincolns Inn he hesitated Thats not in New York is it

No Mr Tembarom in London I come from England

You must have had bad weather crossing said Tembarom with amiable
intent Somehow Mr Palford presented a more unyielding surface than he
was accustomed to And yet his hard courtesy was quite perfect

I have been here some weeks

I hope you like New York Wont you have a seat

The young lady from the notion counter and her friends began to sing
the chorus of He sutnly was Good to Me with quite professional negro
accent

Thats just the way May Irwin done it one of them laughed

Mr Palford glanced at the performers He did not say whether he liked
New York or not

I asked your landlady if we could not see each other in a private
room he said It would not be possible to talk quietly here

We shouldnt have much of a show answered Tembarom inwardly wishing
he knew what was going to happen But there are no private rooms in the
house We can be quieter than this though if we go up stairs to Mr
Hutchinsons room He said I could bring you

That would be much better replied Mr Palford

Tembarom led him out of the room up the first steep and narrow flight
of stairs along the narrow hall to the second up that down another
hall to the third up the third and on to the fourth As he led the way
he realized again that the worn carpets the steep narrowness and the
pieces of paper unfortunately stripped off the wall at intervals were
being rather counted against him This man had probably never been in a
place like this before in his life and he didnt take to it

At the Hutchinsons door he stopped and explained

We were going to have an oyster stew here because the Hutchinsons are
going away but Mr Hutchinson said we could come up

Very kind of Mr Hutchinson Im sure

Despite his stiffly collected bearing Mr Palford looked perhaps
slightly nervous when he was handed into the bedsittingroom and found
himself confronting Hutchinson and Little Ann and the table set for the
oyster stew It is true that he had never been in such a place in his
life that for many reasons he was appalled and that he was beset by a
fear that he might be grotesquely compelled by existing circumstances to
accept these peoples invitation if they insisted upon his sitting down
with them and sharing their oyster stew One could not calculate on what
would happen among these unknown quantities It might be their idea of
boardinghouse politeness And how could one offend them God forbid
that the situation should intensify itself in such an absurdly trying
manner What a bounder the unfortunate young man was His own experience
had not been such as to assist him to any realistic enlightenment
regarding him even when he had seen the society page and had learned
that he had charge of it

Let me make you acquainted with Mr and Miss Hutchinson Tembarom
introduced This is Mr Palford Mr Hutchinson

Hutchinson half hidden behind his newspaper jerked his head and
grunted

Glad to see you sir

Mr Palford bowed and took the chair Tembarom presented

I am much obliged to you Mr Hutchinson for allowing me to come to
your room I have business to discuss with Mr Tembarom and the pianola
was being played downstairsrather loudly

They do it every night dang em Right under my bed growled
Hutchinson Youre an Englishman arent you

Yes

So am I thank God Hutchinson devoutly gave forth

Little Ann rose from her chair sewing in hand

Fatherll come and sit with me in my room she said

Hutchinson looked grumpy He did not intend to leave the field clear
and the stew to its fate if he could help it He gave Ann a protesting
frown

I dare say Mr Palford doesnt mind us he said Were not
strangers

Not in the least Palford protested Certainly not If you are old
friends you may be able to assist us

Well I dont know about that Hutchinson answered Weve not known
him long but we know him pretty well You come from London dont you

Yes From Lincolns Inn Fields

Law grunted Hutchinson

Yes Of the firm of Palford  Grimby

Hutchinson moved in his chair involuntarily There was stimulation to
curiosity in this This chap was a regular top sawyerclothes way of
pronouncing his words manners everything No mistaking himold family
solicitor sort of chap What on earth could he have to say to Tembarom
Tembarom himself had sat down and could not be said to look at his ease

I do not intrude without the excuse of serious business Palford
explained to him A great deal of careful research and inquiry has
finally led me here I am compelled to believe I have followed the
right clue but I must ask you a few questions Your name is not really
Tembarom is it

Hutchinson looked at Tembarom sharply

Not Tembarom What does he mean lad

Tembaroms grin was at once boyish and ashamed

Well it is in one way he answered and it isnt in another The
fellows at school got into the way of calling me that wayto save
time I guessand I got to like it Theyd have guyed my real name
Most of them never knew it I cant see why any one ever called a child
by such a fool name anyhow

What was it exactly

Tembarom looked almost sheepish

It sounds like a thing in a novel It was Temple Temple Barholm Two
Temples by gee As if one wasnt enough

Joseph Hutchinson dropped his paper and almost started from his chair
His red face suddenly became so much redder that he looked a trifle
apoplectic

Temple Barholm does tha say he cried out

Mr Palford raised his hand and checked him but with a suggestion of
stiff apology

If you will kindly allow me Did you ever hear your father refer to a
place called Temple Barholm he inquired

Tembarom reflected as though sending his thoughts backward into a
pretty thoroughly forgotten and ignored past There had been no reason
connected with filial affection which should have caused him to recall
memories of his father They had not liked each other He had known
that he had been resented and looked down upon as a characteristically
American product His father had more than once said he was a common
American lad and he had known he was

Seems to me he said at last that once when he was pretty mad at his
luck I heard him grumbling about English laws and he said some of his
distant relations were swell people who would never think of speaking to
himperhaps didnt know he was aliveand they lived in a big way in
a place that was named after the family He never saw it or them and he
said that was the way in Englandone fellow got everything and the rest
were paupers like himself Hed always been poor

Yes the relation was a distant one Until this investigation began the
family knew nothing of him The inquiry has been a tiresome one I trust
I am reaching the end of it We have given nearly two years to following
this clue

What for burst forth Tembarom sitting upright

Because it was necessary to find either George Temple Barholm or his
son if he had one

Im his son all right but he died when I was eight years old
Tembarom volunteered I dont remember much about him

You remember that he was not an American

He was English Hated it but he wasnt fond of America

Have you any papers belonging to him

Tembarom hesitated again

Theres a few old lettersoh and one of those glass photographs in
a case I believe its my grandfather and grandmother taken when they
were married Him on a chair you know and her standing with her hand
on his shoulder

Can you show them to me Palford suggested

Sure Tembarom answered getting up from his seat Theyre in my room
I turned them up yesterday among some other things

When he left them Mr Palford sat gently rubbing his chin Hutchinson
wanted to burst forth with questions but he looked so remote and
acidly dignified that there was a suggestion of boldness in the idea of
intruding on his reflections Hutchinson stared at him and breathed hard
and short in his suspense The stiff old chap was thinking things
over and putting things together in his lawyers way He was entirely
oblivious to his surroundings Little Ann went on with her mending but
she wore her absorbed look and it was not a result of her work

Tembarom came back with some papers in his hand They were yellowed
old letters and on the top of the package there was a worn
daguerreotypecase with broken clasp

Here they are he said giving them to Palford I guess theyd just
been married opening the case Get on to her embroidered collar and
big breastpin with his picture in it Thats English enough isnt it
Hed given it to her for a weddingpresent Theres something in one of
the letters about it

It was the letters to which Mr Palford gave the most attention He read
them and examined postmarks and dates When he had finished he
rose from his chair with a slightly portentous touch of professional
ceremony

Yes those are sufficiently convincing You are a very fortunate young
man Allow me to congratulate you

He did not look particularly pleased though he extended his hand and
shook Tembaroms politely He was rigorously endeavoring to conceal that
he found himself called upon to make the best of an extremely bad job
Hutchinson started forward resting his hands on his knees and glaring
with illsuppressed excitement

Whats that for Tembarom said He felt rather like a fool He laughed
half nervously It seemed to be up to him to understand and he didnt
understand in the least

You have through your fathers distant relationship inherited a
very magnificent propertythe estate of Temple Barholm in Lancashire
Palford began to explain but Mr Hutchinson sprang from his chair
outright crushing his paper in his hand

Temple Barholm he almost shouted I dunnot believe thee Why its
one of th oldest places in England and one of th biggest Th Temple
Barholms as didnt come over with th Conqueror was there before him
Some of them was Saxon kings And him pointing a stumpy red finger
disparagingly at Tembarom aghast and incredulousthat New York lad
thats sold newspapers in the streetsyou say hes come into it

Precisely Mr Palford spoke with some crispness of diction Noise
and bluster annoyed him That is my business here Mr Tembarom is
in fact Mr Temple Temple Barholm of Temple Barholm which you seem to
have heard of

Heard of it My mother was born in the village an lives there yet Art
tha struck dumb lad he said almost fiercely to Tembarom By Judd
Tha well may be

Tembarom was standing holding the back of a chair He was pale and
had once opened his mouth and then gulped and shut it Little Ann had
dropped her sewing His first look had leaped to her and she had looked
back straight into his eyes

Im struck something he said his halflaugh slightly unsteady
Whod blame me

Youd better sit down said Little Ann Sudden things are upsetting

He did sit down He felt rather shaky He touched himself on his chest
and laughed again

Me he said T T Hully gee Its like a turn at a vaudeville

The sentiment prevailing in Hutchinsons mind seemed to verge on
indignation

Thee th master of Temple Barholm he ejaculated Why it stood for
seventy thousand pound a year

It did and it does said Mr Palford curtly He had less and less
taste for the situation There was neither dignity nor proper sentiment
in it The young man was utterly incapable of comprehending the meaning
and proportions of the extraordinary event which had befallen him It
appeared to present to him the aspect of a somewhat slangy New York
joke

You do not seem much impressed Mr Temple Barholm he said

Oh Im impressed all right answered Tembarom but say this thing
cant be true You couldnt make it true if you sat up all night to do
it

When I go into the business details of the matter tomorrow morning
you will realize the truth of it said Mr Palford Seventy thousand
pounds a yearand Temple Barholmare not unsubstantial facts

Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars my ladthats what it stands
for put in Mr Hutchinson

Well said Tembarom I guess I can worry along on that if I try hard
enough I maynt be able to keep myself in the way Ive been used to
but Ive got to make it do

Mr Palford stiffened He did not know that the garish
flippantsounding joking was the kind of defense the streets of New York
had provided Mr Temple Barholm with in many an hour when he had been
a halfclad newsboy with an empty stomach and a bundle of unsold
newspapers under his arm

You are jocular he said I find the New Yorkers are given to being
jocularcontinuously

Tembarom looked at him rather searchingly Palford wouldnt have found
it possible to believe that the young man knew all about his distaste
and its near approach to disgust that he knew quite well what he
thought of his tendollar suit his exnewsboys diction and his entire
incongruousness as a factor in any circumstances connected with dignity
and splendor He would certainly not have credited the fact that though
he had not the remotest idea what sort of a place Temple Barholm was
and what sort of men its long line of possessors had been he had gained
a curious knowledge of their significance through the mental attitude
of their legal representative when he for a moment failed to conceal his
sense of actual revolt

It seems sort of like a joke till you get on to it he said But I
guess it aint such a merry jest as it seems

And then Mr Palford did begin to observe that he had lost his color
entirely also that he had a rather decent sharpcut face and
extremely white and good young teeth which he showed not unattractively
when he smiled And he smiled frequently but he was not smiling now




CHAPTER VII


In the course of the interview given to the explaining of business and
legal detail which took place between Mr Palford and his client the
following morning Tembaroms knowledge of his situation extended itself
largely and at the same time added in a proportionate degree to his
sense of his own incongruity as connected with it He sat at a table in
Palfords private sittingroom at the respectable oldfashioned hotel
the solicitor had chosensat and listened and answered questions and
asked them until his head began to feel as though it were crammed to
bursting with extraordinary detail

It was all extraordinary to him He had had no time for reading and no
books to read and therefore knew little of fiction He was entirely
ignorant of all romance but such as the New York papers provided This
was highly colored but it did not deal with events connected with the
possessors of vast English estates and the details of their habits and
customs His geographical knowledge of Great Britain was simple and
largely incorrect Information concerning its usual conditions and
aspects had come to him through talk of international marriages and
cup races and had made but little impression upon him He liked New
Yorkits noise its streets its glare its Sunday newspapers with
their everincreasing number of sheets and pictures of everything
on earth which could be photographed His choice when he could allow
himself a fiftycent seat at the theater naturally ran to productions
which were farcical or cheerfully musical He had never reached serious
drama perhaps because he had never had money enough to pay for entrance
to anything like half of the shows the other fellows recommended He
was totally unprepared for the facing of any kind of drama as connected
with himself The worst of it was that it struck him as being of the
nature of farce when regarded from the normal New York point of view If
he had somehow had the luck to come into the possession of money in ways
which were familiar to himto strike it rich in the way of a big
job or dealhe would have been better able to adjust himself to
circumstances He might not have known how to spend his money but he
would have spent it in New York on New York joys There would have
been no foreign remoteness about the thing howsoever fantastically
unexpected such fortune might have been At any rate in New York he
would have known the names of places and things

Through a large part of his interview with Palford his elbow rested
on the table and he held his chin with his hand and rubbed it
thoughtfully The last Temple Temple Barholm had been an eccentric and
uncompanionable person He had lived alone and had not married He had
cherished a prejudice against the man who would have succeeded him as
next of kin if he had not died young People had been of the opinion
that he had disliked him merely because he did not wish to be reminded
that some one else must some day inevitably stand in his shoes and
own the possessions of which he himself was arrogantly fond There were
always more female Temple Barholms than male ones and the families
were small The relative who had emigrated to Brooklyn had been a
comparatively unknown person His only intercourse with the head of the
house had been confined to a begging letter written from America
when his circumstances were at their worst It was an illmannered and
illexpressed letter which had been considered presuming and had been
answered chillingly with a mere fivepound note clearly explained as
a final charity This begging letter which bitterly contrasted the
writers poverty with his indifferent relatives luxuries had by a
curious trick of chance which preserved it quite extraordinarily turned
up during an examination of apparently unimportant forgotten papers
and had furnished a clue in the search for next of kin The writer had
greatly annoyed old Mr Temple Barholm by telling him that he had called
his son by his namenot that there was ever likely to be anything in
it for him But a waif of the New York streets who was known as Tem
or Tembarom was not a link easily attached to any chain and the
search had been long and rather hopeless It had however at last
reached Mrs Bowses boardinghouse and before Mr Palford sat Mr
Temple Temple Barholm a cheap young man in cheap clothes and speaking
New York slang with a nasal accent Mr Palford feeling him appalling
and absolutely without the pale was still aware that he stood in the
position of an important client of the firm of Palford  Grimby There
was a section of the offices at Lincolns Inn devoted to documents
representing a lifetime of attention to the affairs of the Temple
Barholm estates It was greatly to be hoped that the crass ignorance
and commonness of this young outsider would not cause impossible
complications

He knows nothing He knows nothing Palford found himself forced to
exclaim mentally not once but a hundred times in the course of their
talk

There wasthis revealed itself as the interview proceededjust one
slight palliation of his impossible benightedness he was not the
kind of young man who knowing nothing huffily protects himself by
pretending to know everything He was of an unreserve concerning his
ignorance which his solicitor felt sometimes almost struck one in the
face Now and then it quite made one jump He was singularly free from
any vestige of personal vanity He was also singularly unready to
take offense To the head of the firm of Palford  Grimby who was
not accustomed to lightness of manner and inclined to the view that a
person who made a joke took rather a liberty with him his tendency to
be jocular even about himself and the estate of Temple Barholm was
irritating and somewhat disrespectful Mr Palford did not easily
comprehend jokes of any sort especially was he annoyed by cryptic
phraseology and mammoth exaggeration For instance he could not in the
least compass Mr Temple Barholms meaning when he casually remarked
that something or other was all to the merry or again quite as
though he believed that he was using reasonable English figures of
speech The old fellow thought he was the only pebble on the beach In
using the latter expression he had been referring to the late Mr Temple
Barholm but what on earth was his connection with the seashore and
pebbles When confronted with these baffling absurdities Mr Palford
either said I beg pardon or stiffened and remained silent

When Tembarom learned that he was the head of one of the oldest families
in England no aspect of the desirable dignity of his position reached
him in the least

Well he remarked theres quite a lot of us can go back to Adam and
Eve

When he was told that he was lord of the manor of Temple Barholm he did
not know what a manor was

Whats a manor and what happens if youre lord of it he asked

He had not heard of William the Conqueror and did not appear moved to
admiration of him though he owned that he seemed to have put it over

Why didnt he make a republic of it while he was about it he said
But I guess that wasnt his kind He didnt do all that fighting for
his health

His interest was not alone totally dissevered from the events of past
centuries it was as dissevered from those of mere past years The
habits customs and points of view of five years before seemed to
have been cast into a vast wastepaper basket as wholly unpractical in
connection with present experiences

A man thats going to keep up with the procession cant waste time
thinking about yesterday What hes got to do is to keep his eye on
whats going to happen the week after next he summed it up

Rather to Mr Palfords surprise he did not speak lightly but with a
sort of inner seriousness It suggested that he had not arrived at this
conclusion without the aid of sharp experience Now and then one saw a
touch of this profound practical perception in him

It was not to be denied that he was clearheaded enough where purely
practical business detail was concerned He was at first plainly rather
stunned by the proportions presented to him but his questions were
direct and of a commonsense order not to be despised

I dont know anything about it yet he said once Its all Dutch to
me I cant calculate in halfcrowns and pounds and half pounds but Im
going to find out Ive got to

It was extraordinary and annoying to feel that one must explain
everything but this impossible fellow was not an actual fool on all
points and he did not seem to be a weakling He might learn certain
things in time and at all events one was no further personally
responsible for him and his impossibilities than the business concerns
of his estate would oblige any legal firm to be Clients whether
highly desirable or otherwise were no more than clients They were not
relatives whom one must introduce to ones friends Thus Mr Palford
who was not a specially humane or sympathetic person mentally decided
He saw no pathos in this raw young man who would presently find himself
floundering unaided in waters utterly unknown to him There was even a
touch of bitter amusement in the solicitors mind as he glanced toward
the future

He explained with detail the necessity for their immediate departure for
the other side of the Atlantic Certain legal formalities which must at
once be attended to demanded their presence in England Foreseeing this
on the day when he had finally felt himself secure as to the identity
of his client he had taken the liberty of engaging optionally certain
staterooms on the Adriana sailing the following Wednesday

Subject of course to your approval he added politely But it is
imperative that we should be on the spot as early as possible He did
not mention that he himself was abominably tired of his sojourn on alien
shores and wanted to be back in London in his own chambers with his
own club within easy reach

Tembaroms face changed its expression He had been looking rather
weighted down and fatigued and he lighted up to eagerness

Say he exclaimed why couldnt we go on the Transatlantic on
Saturday

It is one of the small cheap boats objected Palford

The accommodation would be most inferior

Tembarom leaned forward and touched his sleeve in hasty boyish appeal

I want to go on it he said I want to go steerage

Palford stared at him

You want to go on the Transatlantic Steerage he ejaculated quite
aghast This was a novel order of madness to reveal itself in the recent
inheritor of a great fortune

Tembaroms appeal grew franker it took on the note of a too crude young
fellows misplaced confidence

You do this for me he said Id give a farm to go on that boat The
Hutchinsons are sailing on itMr and Miss Hutchinson the ones you saw
at the house last night

Iit is really impossible Mr Palford hesitated As to steerage my
dear Mr Temple Barholm youyou cant

Tembarom got up and stood with his hands thrust deep in his pockets It
seemed to be a sort of expression of his sudden hopeful excitement

Why not he said If I own about half of England and have money to
burn I guess I can buy a steerage passage on a nineday steamer

You can buy anything you like Palford answered stiffly It is not a
matter of buying But I should not be conducting myself properly toward
you if I allowed it It would not bebecoming

Becoming cried Tembarom Thunder Its not a spring bat I tell you
I want to go just that way

Palford saw abnormal breakers ahead He felt that he would be glad
when he had landed his charge safely at Temple Barholm Once there his
family solicitor was not called upon to live with him and hobnob with
his extraordinary intimates

As to buying he said still with marked lack of enthusiasm instead
of taking a steerage passage on the Transatlantic yourself you might no
doubt secure firstclass staterooms for Mr and Miss Hutchinson on the
Adriana though I seriously advise against it

Tembarom shook his head

You dont know them he said They wouldnt let me Hutchinsons
a queer old fellow and hes had the hardest kind of luck but hes as
proud as they make em Me butt in and offer to pay their passage back
as if they were paupers just because Ive suddenly struck it rich
Hully gee I guess not A fellow thats been boosted up in the air all
in a minute as I have has got to lie pretty low to keep folks from
wanting to kick him anyhow Hutchinsons a darned sight smarter fellow
than I am and he knows itand hes Lancashire you bet He stopped a
minute and flushed As to Little Ann he saidme make that sort of a
break with HER Well I should be a fool

Palford was a coldblooded and unimaginative person but a long legal
experience had built up within him a certain shrewdness of perception
He had naturally glanced once or twice at the girl sitting still at
her mending and he had observed that she said very little and had a
singularly quiet firm little voice

I beg pardon You are probably right I had very little conversation
with either of them Miss Hutchinson struck me as having an intelligent
face

Shes a wonder said Tembarom devoutly Shes just a wonder

Under the circumstances suggested Mr Palford it might not be a bad
idea to explain to her your idea of the steerage passage An intelligent
girl can often give excellent advice You will probably have an
opportunity of speaking to her tonight Did you say they were sailing
tomorrow

Tomorrow That brought it so near that it gave Tembarom a shock He
had known that they sailed on Saturday and now Saturday had become
tomorrow Things began to surge through his mindall sorts of things
he had no time to think of clearly though it was true they had darted
vaguely about in the delirious excitement of the night during which he
had scarcely slept at all His face changed again and the appeal died
out of it He began to look anxious and restless

Yes theyre going tomorrow he answered

You see argued Mr Palford with conviction how impossible it would
be for us to make any arrangements in so few hours You will excuse my
saying he added punctiliously that I could not make the voyage in
the steerage

Tembarom laughed He thought he saw him doing it

Thats so he said Then with renewed hope he added Say I m
going to try and get them to wait till Wednesday

I do not think Mr Palford began and then felt it wiser to leave
things as they were But Im not qualified to give an opinion I do not
know Miss Hutchinson at all

But the statement was by no means frank He had a private conviction
that he did know her to a certain degree And he did




CHAPTER VIII


There was a slight awkwardness even to Tembarom in entering the
diningroom that evening He had not seen his fellow boarders as his
restless night had made him sleep later than usual But Mrs Bowse had
told him of the excitement he had caused

They just couldnt eat she said They could do nothing but talk
and talk and ask questions and I had waffles too and they got
stonecold

The babel of friendly outcry which broke out on his entry was made up
of jokes ejaculations questions and congratulatory outbursts from all
sides

Good old T T Give him a Harvard yell Rah Rah Rah Lend me
fiftyfive cents Wheres your tiara Darned glad of it Make us a
speech

Say people said Tembarom dont you get me rattled or I cant tell
you anything Im rattled enough already

Well is it true called out Mr Striper

No Tembarom answered back sitting down It couldnt be thats what
I told Palford I shall wake up in a minute or two and find myself in a
hospital with a peacherino of a trained nurse smoothing me piller You
cant fool ME with a pipedream like this Palfords easier hes not a
New Yorker He says it IS true and I cant get out of it

Whew Great Jakes A long breath was exhaled all round the table

What are you anyhow cried Jim Bowles across the dishes

Tembarom rested his elbow on the edge of the table and began to check
off his points on his fingers

Im this he said Im Temple Temple Barholm Esquire of Temple
Barholm Lancashire England At the time of the flood my folks knocked
up a house just about where the ark landed and I guess theyve held on
to it ever since I dont know what business they went into but they
made money Palford swears Ive got three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars a year I wasnt going to call the man a liar but I just missed
it by jings

He was trying to bluff it out Somehow he felt he had to He felt it
more than ever when a momentary silence fell upon those who sat about
the table It fell when he said three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars a year No one could find voice to make any remark for a few
seconds after that

Are you a lordor a duke some one asked after breath had recovered
itself

No Im not he replied with relief I just got out from under that
but the Lord knows how I did it

What are you going to do first said Jim Bowles

Ive got to go and take possession Thats what Palford calls
it Ive been a lost heir for nearly two years and Ive got to show
myself

Hutchinson had not joined the clamor of greeting but had grunted
disapproval more than once He felt that as an Englishman he had a
certain dignity to maintain He knew something about big estates and
their owners He was not like these common New York chaps who regarded
them as Arabian Nights tales to make jokes about He had grown up as a
village boy in proper awe of Temple Barholm They were ignorant fools
this lot He had no patience with them He had left the village and gone
to work in Manchester when he was a boy of twelve but as long as he had
remained in his mothers cottage it had been only decent good manners
for him to touch his forehead respectfully when a Temple Barholm or
a Temple Barholm guest or carriage or pony phaeton passed him by And
this chap was Mr Temple Temple Barholm himself Lord save us

Little Ann said nothing at all but then she seldom said anything
during mealtimes When the rest of the boarders laughed she ate her
dinner and smiled Several times despite her caution Tembarom caught
her eye and somehow held it a second with his She smiled at him when
this happened but there was something restless and eager in his look
which made her wish to evade it She knew what he felt and she knew why
he kept up his jokes and never once spoke seriously She knew he was
not comfortable and did not enjoy talking about hundreds of thousands
a year to people who worked hard for ten or twenty per Tomorrow
morning was very near she kept thinking Tomorrow night she would be
lying in her berth in the steerage or more probably taking care of her
father who would be very uncomfortable

What will Galton do Mr Striper asked

I dont know Tembarom answered and he looked troubled Three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars a year might not be able to give aid to a
wounded society page

What are you going to do with your Freak called out Julius
Steinberger

Tembarom actually started As things had surged over him he had had
too much to think over He had not had time to give to his strange
responsibility it had become one nevertheless

Are you going to leave him behind when you go to England

He leaned forward and put his chin on his hand

Why say he said as though he were thinking it out hes spoken
about England two or three times Hes said he must go there By jings
Ill take him with me and see whatll happen

When Little Ann got up to leave the room he followed her and her father
into the hall

May I come up and talk it over with you he appealed Ive got to
talk to some one who knows something about it I shall go dotty if I
dont Its too much like a dream

Come on up when youre ready answered Hutchinson Ann and me can
give you a tip or two

Im going to be putting the last things in the trunks said Ann but
I dare say you wont mind that The expressll be here by eight in the
morning

O Lord groaned Tembarom

When he went up to the fourth floor a little later Hutchinson had
fallen into a doze in his chair over his newspaper and Ann was kneeling
by a trunk in the hall folding small articles tightly and fitting them
into corners To Tembarom she looked even more than usual like a slight
child thing one could snatch up in ones arms and carry about or set on
ones knee without feeling her weight at all An inferior gasjet on the
wall just above her was doing its best with the lot of soft red hair
which would have been an untidy bundle if it had not been hers

Tembarom sat down on the trunk next to her

O Little Ann he broke out under his breath lest the sound of his
voice might check Hutchinsons steady snoring O Little Ann

Ann leaned back sitting upon her small heels and looked up at him

Youre all upset and its not to be wondered at Mr Temple Barholm
she said

Upset Youre going away tomorrow morning And for the Lords sake
dont call me that he protested

Youre going away yourself next Wednesday And you ARE Mr Temple
Barholm Youll never be called anything else in England

How am I going to stand it he protested again How could a fellow
like me stand it To be yanked out of good old New York and set down in
a place like a museum with Central Park round it and called Mr Temple
Temple Barholm instead of just Tem or T T Its not natural

What you must do Mr Temple Barholm is to keep your head clear
thats all she replied maturely

Lord if Id got a head like yours

She seemed to take him in with a benign appreciativeness in his
entirety

Well you havent she admitted though quite without disparagement
merely with slight reservation But youve got one like your own And
its a good headwhen you try to think steady Yours is a mans head
and mines only a womans

Its Little Ann Hutchinsons by gee said Tembarom with feeling

Listen here Mr TemTemple Barholm she went on as nearly disturbed
as he had ever seen her outwardly Its a wonderful thing thats
happened to you Its like a novel That splendid place that splendid
name It seems so queer to think I should ever have talked to a Mr
Temple Barholm as Ive talked to you

He leaned forward a little as though something drew him

Butthere was unsteady appeal in his voiceyou have liked me
havent you Little Ann

Her own voice seemed to drop into an extra quietness that made it
remote She looked down at her hands on her lap

Yes I have liked you I have told Father I liked you she answered

He got up and made an impetuous rush at his goal

Thensay Im going in there to wake up Mr Hutchinson and ask him not
to sail tomorrow morning

Youd better not wake him up she answered smiling but he saw
that her face changed and flushed Its not a good time to ask Father
anything when hes just been waked up And we HAVE to go The express is
coming at eight

Send it away again tell em youre not going Tell em any old thing
Little Ann whats the matter with you Somethings the matter Have I
made a break

He had felt the remoteness in her even before he had heard it in her
dropped voice It had been vaguely there even when he sat down on the
trunk Actually there was a touch of reserve about her as though she
was keeping her little place with the selfrespecting propriety of a
girl speaking to a man not of her own world

I dare say Ive done some fool thing without knowing it I dont know
where Im at anyhow he said woefully

Dont look at me like that Mr Temple Barholm she saidas if I was
unkind IIm NOT

But youre different he implored I saw it the minute I came up I
ran upstairs just crazy to talk to youyes crazy to talk to youand
youwell you were different Why are you if youre not mad

Then she rose and stood holding one of her neatly rolled packages in
her hand Her eyes were soft and clear and appealed maternally to his
reason

Because everythings different You just think a bit she answered

He stared at her a few seconds and then understanding of her dawned
upon him He made a human young dash at her and caught her arm

What he cried out You mean this Temple Barholm song and dance makes
things different Not on your life Youre not the girl to work that
on me as if it was my fault Youve got to hear me speak my piece
Annyouve just got to

He had begun to tremble a little and she herself was not steady but
she put a hand on his arm

Dont say anything youve not had time to think about she said

Ive been thinking of pretty near nothing else ever since I came here
Just as soon as I looked at you across the table that first day I saw my
finish and every day made me surer Id never had any comfort or taking
care ofI didnt know the first thing about itand it seemed as if
all there was of it in the world was just in YOU

Did you think that she asked falteringly

Did I Thats how you looked to me and its how you look now The way
you go about taking care of everybody and just handing out solid little
chunks of good sense to every darned fool that needs them why There
was a break in his voicewhy it just knocked me out the first round
He held her a little away from him so that he could yearn over her
though he did not know he was yearning See Id sworn Id never ask a
girl to marry me until I could keep her Well you know how it was Ann
I couldnt have kept a goat and I wasnt such a fool that I didnt know
it Ive been pretty sick when I thought how it was but I never worried
you did I

No you didnt

I just got busy I worked likewell I got busier than I ever was
in my life When I got the page SURE I let myself go a bit sort of
hoping And then this Temple Barholm thing hits me

Thats the thing youve got to think of now said Little Ann Im
going to talk sensible to you

Dont Ann Good Lord DONT

I MUST She put her last tight roll into the trunk and tried to shut
the lid Please lock this for me

He locked it and then she seated herself on the top of it though it
was rather high for her and her small feet dangled Her eyes looked
large and moist like a babys and she took out a handkerchief and
lightly touched them

Youve made me want to cry a bit she said but Im not going to

Are you going to tell me you dont want me he asked with anxious
eyes

No Im not

God bless you He was going to make a dash at her again but pulled
himself up because he must No by jings he said Im not going to
till you let me

You see its true your heads not like mine she said reasonably
Mens heads are mostly not like womens Theyre men of course and
theyre superior to women but theyre what Id call more flutterylike
Women must remind them of things

Whatwhat kind of things

This kind You see Grandmother lives near Temple Barholm and I know
what its like and you dont And Ive seen what seventy thousand
pounds a year means and you havent And youve got to go and find out
for yourself

Whats the matter with you coming along to help me

I shouldnt help you thats it I should hold you back Im nothing
but Ann Hutchinson and I talk Manchesterand I drop my hs

I love to hear you drop your little hs all over the place he burst
forth impetuously I love it

She shook her head

The girls that go to gardenparties at Temple Barholm look like those
in the Ladies Pictorial and theyve got names and titles same as
those in novels

He answered her in genuine anguish He had never made any mistake about
her character and she was beginning to make him feel afraid of her in
the midst of his adoration

What do I want with a girl out of a magazine he cried Where should
I hang her up

She was not unfeeling but unshaken and she went on

I should look like a housemaid among them How would you feel with a
wife of that sort when the other sort was about

I should feel like a king thats what I should feel like he replied
indignantly

I shouldnt feel like a queen I should feel MISERABLE

She sat with her little feet dangling and her hands folded in her lap
Her infantile blue eyes held him as the Ancient Mariner had been held
He could not get away from the clear directness of them He did not want
to exactly but she frightened him more and more

I should be ashamed she proceeded I should feel as if I had taken
an advantage What youve got to do is to find out something no one else
can find out for you Mr Temple Barholm

How can I find it out without you It was you who put me on to the
weddingcake you can put me on to other things

Because Ive lived in the place she answered unswervingly I know
how funny it is for any one to think of me being Mrs Temple Barholm
You dont

You bet I dont he answered but Ill tell you what I do know and
thats how funny it is that I should be Mr Temple Barholm Ive got on
to that all right all right Have you

She looked at him with a reflection that said much She took him in with
a judicial summing up of which it must be owned an added respect was
part She had always believed he had more sense than most young men and
now she knew it

When a persons clever enough to see things for himself hes generally
clever enough to manage them she replied

He knelt down beside the trunk and took both her hands in his He held
them fast and rather hard

Are you throwing me down for good Little Ann he said If you are I
cant stand it I wont stand it

If you care about me like that youll do what I tell you she
interrupted and she slipped down from the top of her trunk I know
what Mother would say Shed say Ann you give that young man a
chance And Im going to give you one Ive said all Im going to Mr
Temple Barholm

He took both her elbows and looked at her closely feeling a somewhat
awed conviction

Ibelieveyou have he said

And here the sound of Mr Hutchinsons loud and stertorous breathing
ceased and he waked up and came to the door to find out what Ann was
doing

What are you two talking about he asked People think when they
whisper its not going to disturb anybody but its worse than shouting
in a mans ear

Tembarom walked into the room

Ive been asking Little Ann to marry me he announced and she
wont

He sat down in a chair helplessly and let his head fall into his hands

Eh exclaimed Hutchinson He turned and looked at Ann disturbedly I
thought a bit ago tha didnt deny but what thad took to him

I didnt Father she answered I dont change my mind that quick
Iwould have been willing to say Yes when you wouldnt have been
willing to let me I didnt know he was Mr Temple Barholm then

Hutchinson rubbed the back of his head reddening and rather bristling

Dost tha think th Temple Barholms would look down on thee

I should look down on myself if I took him up at his first words when
hes all upset with excitement and hasnt had time to find out what
things mean Imwell I m too fond of him Father

Hutchinson gave her a long steady look

You are he said

Yes I am

Tembarom lifted his head and looked at her too

Are you he asked

She put her hands behind her back and returned his look with the calm
of ages

Im not going to argue about it she answered Arguings silly

His involuntary rising and standing before her was a sort of unconscious
tribute of respect

I know that he owned I know you Thats why I take it like this
But I want you to tell me one thing If this hadnt happened if Id
only had twenty dollars a week would you have taken me

If youd had fifteen and Father could have spared me Id have taken
you Fifteen dollars a week is three pounds two and sixpence and Ive
known curates wives that had to bring up families on less It wouldnt
go as far in New York as it would in the country in England but we
could have made it dountil you got more I know you too Mr Temple
Barholm

He turned to her father and saw in his florid countenance that which
spurred him to bold disclosure

Say he put it to him as man to man she stands there and says a
thing like that and she expects a fellow not to jerk her into his arms
and squeeze the life out of her I darent do it and Im not going to
try butwell you said her mother was like her and I guess you know
what Im up against

Hutchinsons grunting chuckle contained implications of exultant
tenderness and gratified paternal pride

Shes th very spit and image of her mother he said and she had th
sense of ten women rolled into one and th love of twenty You let her
be and youre as safe as th Rock of Ages

Do you think I dont know that answered Tembarom his eyes shining
almost to moisture But what hits me by thunder is that Ive lost the
chance of seeing her work out that fifteendollaraweek proposition
and it drives me crazy

I should have downright liked to try it said Little Ann with
speculative reflection and while she knitted her brows in lovely
consideration of the attractive problem several previously unknown
dimples declared themselves about her mouth

Ann Tembarom ventured if I go to Temple Barholm and try it a year
and learn all about it

It would take more than a year said Ann

Dont make it two Tembarom pleaded Ill sit up at night with wet
towels round my head to learn Ill spend fourteen hours a day with
girls that look like the pictures in the Ladies Pictorial or
whatever it is in England Ill give them every chance in life if
youll let me off afterward There must be another lost heir somewhere
lets dig him up and then come back to little old New York and be happy
Gee Annletting himself go and drawing nearer to herhow happy we
could be in one of those little flats in Harlem

She was a warm little human thing and a tender one and when he came
close to her glowing with tempestuous boyish eagerness her eyes grew
bluer because they were suddenly wet and she was obliged to move softly
back

Yes she said I know those little flats Any one could She
stopped herself because she had been going to reveal what a home a
woman could make in rooms like the compartments in a workbox She knew
and saw it all She drew back a little again but she put out a hand and
laid it on his sleeve

When youve had quite time enough to find out and know what the other
thing means Ill do whatever you want me to do she said It wont
matter what it is Ill do it

She means that Hutchinson mumbled unsteadily turning aside Same as
her mother would have meant it And she means it in more ways than one

And so she did The promise included quite firmly the possibility of not
unnatural changes in himself such as young ardor could not foresee even
the possibility of his new life withdrawing him entirely from the plane
on which rapture could materialize on twenty dollars a week in a flat in
Harlem




CHAPTER IX


Type as exotic as Tembaroms was to his solicitor naturally suggested
problems Mr Palford found his charge baffling because according to
ordinary rules a young man so rudimentary should have presented no
problems not perfectly easy to explain It was herein that he was
exotic Mr Palford who was not given to subtle analysis of differences
in character and temperament argued privately that an English youth who
had been brought up in the streets would have been one of two or three
things He would have been secretly terrified and resentful roughly
awkward and resentful or boastfully delighted and given to a common
youths excitedly common swagger at finding himself suddenly a swell

This special kind of youth would most assuredly have constantly thought
of himself as a swell and would have lost his head altogether
possibly with results in the matter of conduct in public which would
have been either maddening or crushing to the spirit of a wellbred
matureminded legal gentleman temporarily thrust into the position of
bearleader

But Tembarom was none of these things If he was terrified he did
not reveal his anguish He was without doubt not resentful but on the
contrary interested and curious though he could not be said to bear
himself as one elated He indulged in no frolics or extravagances He
saw the Hutchinsons off on their steamer and supplied them with fruit
and flowers and books with respectful moderation He did not conduct
himself as a benefactor bestowing unknown luxuries but as a young man
on whom unexpected luck had bestowed decent opportunities to express his
friendship In fact Palfords taste approved of his attitude He was
evidently much under the spell of the slight girl with the Manchester
accent and sober blue eyes but she was neither flighty nor
meretricious and would have sense enough to give no trouble even when
he naturally forgot her in the revelations of his new life Her father
also was plainly a respectable workingman with a blunt Lancashire
pride which would keep him from intruding

You cant butt in and get fresh with a man like that Tembarom said
Money wouldnt help you Hes too independent

After the steamer had sailed away it was observable to his solicitor
that Mr Temple Barholm was apparently occupied every hour He did not
explain why he seemed to rush from one part of New York to another
and why he seemed to be seeking interviews with persons it was plainly
difficult to get at He was evidently working hard to accomplish
something or other before he left the United States perhaps He asked
some astutely practical business questions his intention seeming to be
to gain a definite knowledge of what his future resources would be and
of his freedom to use them as he chose

Once or twice Mr Palford was rather alarmed by the tendency of his
questions Had he actually some prodigious American scheme in view He
seemed too young and inexperienced in the handling of large sums for
such a possibility But youth and inexperience and suddenly inherited
wealth not infrequently led to rash adventures Something which Palford
called very handsome was done for Mrs Bowse and the boardinghouse
Mrs Bowse was evidently not proud enough to resent being made secure
for a few years rent The extraordinary page was provided for after a
large amount of effort and expenditure of energy

I couldnt leave Galton high and dry Tembarom explained when he came
in after rushing about I think I know a man he might try but Ive got
to find him and put him on to things Good Lord nobody rushed about to
find me and offer me the job I hope this fellow wants it as bad as I
did Hell be up in the air He discovered the whereabouts of the young
man in question and finding him as the youngster almost tearfully
declared about down and out his proposition was met with the
gratitude the relief from a prospect of something extremely like
starvation would mentally produce Tembarom took him to Galton after
having talked him over in detail

Hes had an education and you know how much Id had when I butted into
the page he said No one but you would have let me try it You did it
only because you sawyou saw

Yes I saw answered Galton who knew exactly what he had seen and
who found his uptown social representative and his new situation as
interesting as amusing and just touched with the pathetic element
Galton was a traveled man and knew England and several other countries
well

You saw that a fellow wanted the job as much as I did would be likely
to put up a good fight to hold it down I was scared out of my life when
I started out that morning of the blizzard but I couldnt afford to be
scared I guess soldiers who are scared fight like that when they see
bayonets coming at them You have to

I wonder how often a man finds out that he does pretty big things
when bayonets are coming at him answered Galton who was actually
neglecting his work for a few minutes so that he might look at and talk
to him this New York descendant of Norman lords and Saxon kings

Joe Bennett had been trying to live off freelunch counters for a week
when I found him Tembarom explained You dont know what that is
Hell go at the page all right Im going to take him uptown and
introduce him to my friends there and get them to boost him along

You made friends said Galton I knew you would

Some of the best ever Goodnatured and openhanded Well you bet
Only trouble was they wanted you to eat and drink everything in sight
and they didnt quite like it when you couldnt get outside all the
champagne theyd offer you

He broke into a big pleased laugh

When I went in and told Munsberg he pretty near threw a fit Of course
he thought I was kidding But when I made him believe it he was as glad
as if hed had luck himself It was just fine the way people took
it Tell you what it takes good luck or bad luck to show you how
goodnatured a lot of folks are Theyll treat Bennett and the page all
right youll see

Theyll miss you said Galton

I shall miss them Tembarom answered in a voice with a rather
depressed drop in it

I shall miss you said Galton

Tembaroms face reddened a little

I guess itd seem rather fresh for me to tell you how I shall miss
you he said I said that first day that I didnt know how to tell you
how Iwell how I felt about you giving a mutt like me that big chance
You never thought I didnt know how little I did know did you he
inquired almost anxiously

That was itthat you did know and that you had the backbone and the
good spirits to go in and win Galton replied Im a tired man and
good spirits and good temper seem to me about the biggest assets a man
can bring into a thing I shouldnt have dared do it when I was your
age You deserved the Victoria Cross he added chuckling

Whats the Victoria Cross asked Tembarom

Youll find out when you go to England

Well Im not supposing that you dont know about how many billion
things Ill have to find out when I go to England

There will be several thousand replied Galton moderately but youll
learn about them as you go on

Say said Tembarom reflectively doesnt it seem queer to think of
a fellow having to keep up his spirits because hes fallen into three
hundred and fifty thousand a year You wouldnt think hed have to
would you

But you find he has queried Galton interestedly

Tembaroms lifted eyes were so honest that they were touching

I dont know where Im at he said Im going to wake up in a new
placelike people that die If you knew what it was like you wouldnt
mind it so much but you dont know a blamed thing Its not having seen
a sample that rattles you

Youre fond of New York

Good Lord its all the place I know on earth and its just about good
enough for me by gee Its kept me alive when it might have starved
me to death My Ive had good times here he added flushing with
emotion Good timeswhen I hadnt a whole meal a day

Youd have good times anywhere commented Galton also with feeling
You carry them over your shoulder and you share them with a lot of
other people

He certainly shared some with Joe Bennett whom he took uptown and
introduced right and left to his friendly patrons who excited by the
atmosphere of adventure and prosperity received him with open arms
To have been the choice of T Tembarom as a mere representative of the
EARTH would have been a great thing for Bennett but to be the choice of
the hero of a romance of wildest opulence was a tremendous sendoff
He was accepted at once and when Tembarom actually stood for a big
farewell supper of his own in The Hall and nearly had his hand shaken
off by congratulating acquaintances the fact that he kept the new
aspirant by his side so that the waves of high popularity flowed over
him until he sometimes lost his joyful breath established him as a sort
of hero himself

Mr Palford did not know of this festivity as he also found he was
not told of several other things This he counted as a feature of his
clients exoticism His extraordinary lack of concealment of things
vanity forbids many from confessing combined itself with a quite
cheerful power to keep his own counsel when he was for reasons of his
own so inclined

He can keep his mouth shut that chap Hutchinson had said once and
Mr Palford remembered it Most of us cant Ive got a notion I can
but I dont manys the time when I should Theres a lot more in him
than youd think for Hes naught but a lad but he is na half such a
fool as he looks

He was neither hesitant nor timid Mr Palford observed In an entirely
unostentatious way he soon realized that his money gave things into
his hands He knew he could do most things he chose to do and that the
power to do them rested in these days with himself without the necessity
of detailed explanation or appeal to others as in the case for
instance of this mysterious friend or protege whose name was
Strangeways Of the history of his acquaintance with him Palford knew
nothing and that he should choose to burden himself with a halfwitted
invalidin these terms the solicitor described himwas simply
inexplainable If he had asked for advice or by his manner left
an opening for the offering of it he would have been most strongly
counseled to take him to a public asylum and leave him there but advice
on the subject seemed the last thing he desired or anticipated and talk
about his friend was what he seemed least likely to indulge in He made
no secret of his intentions but he frankly took charge of them as his
own special business and left the rest alone

Say nothing and saw wood Palford had once been a trifle puzzled
by hearing him remark casually and he remembered it later as he
remembered the comments of Joseph Hutchinson Tembarom had explained
himself to Little Ann

Youll understand he said It is like this I guess I feel like you
do when a dog or a cat in big trouble just looks at you as if you
were all they had and they know if you dont stick by them theyll be
killed and it just drives them crazy Its the way they look at you
that you cant stand I believe something would burst in that fellows
brain if I left him When he found out I was going to do it hed just
let out some awful kind of a yell Id remember till I died I dried
right up almost as soon as I spoke of him to Palford He couldnt see
anything but that he was crazy and ought to be put in an asylum Well
hes not Therere times when he talks to me almost sensible only hes
always so awful low down in his mind youre afraid to let him go on And
hes a little bit better than he was It seems queer to get to like
a man thats sort of dotty but I tell you Ann because youll
understandIve got to sort of like him and want to see if I can work
it out for him somehow England seems to sort of stick in his mind If
I cant spend my money in living the way I want to livebuying jewelry
and clothes for the girl Id like to see dressed like a queenIm going
to do this just to please myself Im going to take him to England and
keep him quiet and see whatll happen Those big doctors ought to know
about all there is to know and I can pay them any old thing they want
By jings isnt it the limitto sit here and say that and know its
true

Beyond the explaining of necessary detail to him and piloting him to
England Mr Palford did not hold himself many degrees responsible His
theory of correct conduct assumed no form of altruism He had formulated
it even before he reached middle age One of his fixed rules was to
avoid the error of allowing sympathy or sentiment to hamper him with
any unnecessary burden Natural tendency of temperament had placed no
obstacles in the way of his keeping this rule To burden himself with
the instruction or modification of this unfortunately hopeless young New
Yorker would be unnecessary Palfords summing up of him was that he was
of a type with which nothing palliative could be done There he was
As unavoidable circumstances forced one to take himcommonness
slanginess appalling ignorance and allone could not leave him
Fortunately no respectable legal firm need hold itself sponsor for a
next of kin provided by fate and the wilds of America

The Temple Barholm estate had never in Mr Palfords generation been
specially agreeable to deal with The late Mr Temple Temple Barholm had
been a client of eccentric and abominable temper Interviews with him
had been avoided as much as possible His domineering insolence of
bearing had at times been on the verge of precipitating unheardof
actions because it was almost more than gentlemanly legal flesh and
blood could bear And now appeared this young man

He rushed about New York strenuously attending to business concerning
himself and his extraordinary acquaintances and on the day of the
steamers sailing he presented himself at the last moment in an
obviously just purchased suit of horribly cut clothes At all events
their cut was horrible in the eyes of Mr Palford who accepted no
cut but that of a West End tailor They were badly made things enough
because they were unconsidered garments that Tembarom had barely found
time to snatch from a readymade counter at the last moment He had
been too much rushed by other things to remember that he must have
them until almost too late to get them at all He bought them merely
because they were clothes and warm enough to make a voyage in He
possessed a monster ulster in which to Mr Palfords mind he
looked like a flashy blackleg He did not know it was flashy His
opportunities for cultivating a refined taste in the matter of wardrobe
had been limited and he had wasted no time in fastidious consideration
or regrets Palford did him some injustice in taking it for granted that
his choice of costume was the result of deliberate bad taste It was
really not choice at all He neither liked his clothes nor disliked
them He had been told he needed warm garments and he had accepted the
advice of the first salesman who took charge of him when he dropped into
the big department store he was most familiar with because it was the
cheapest in town Even when it was no longer necessary to be cheap it
was timesaving and easy to go into a place one knew

The fact that he was as he was and that they were the subjects of
comment and objects of unabated interest throughout the voyage that it
was proper that they should be companions at table and on deck filled
Mr Palford with annoyed unease

Of course every one on board was familiar with the story of the
discovery of the lost heir The newspapers had reveled in it and had
woven romances about it which might well have caused the deceased Mr
Temple Barholm to turn in his grave After the first day Tembarom had
been picked out from among the lessexciting passengers and when he
walked the deck books were lowered into laps or eyes followed him over
their edges His steamerchair being placed in a prominent position
next to that of a pretty effusive Southern woman the mother of three
daughters whose eyes and eyelashes attracted attention at the
distance of a decks length he was without undue delay provided
with acquaintances who were prepared to fill his every moment with
entertainment

The three Gazelles as their mother playfully confided to Tembarom
her daughters were called in Charleston were destructively lovely
They were swaying reeds of grace and being in radiant spirits at the
prospect of going to Europe were companions to lure a man to any
desperate lengths They laughed incessantly as though they were chimes
of silver bells they had magnoliapetal skins which neither wind nor
sun blemished they had nice young manners and soft moods in which
their gazelle eyes melted and glowed and their long lashes drooped
They could dance they played on guitars and they sang They were as
adorable as they were lovely and gay

If a fellow was going to fall in love Tembarom said to Palford
thered be no way out of this for him unless he climbed the rigging and
dragged his food up in a basket till he got to Liverpool If he didnt
go crazy about Irene hed wake up raving about Honora and if he got
away from Honora Adelia Louise would have him down on the mat From
which Mr Palford argued that the impression made by the little Miss
Hutchinson with the Manchester accent had not yet had time to obliterate
itself

The Gazelles were of generous Southern spirit and did not surround
their prize with any barrier of precautions against other young persons
of charm They introduced him to one girl after another and in a day
or two he was the center of animated circles whenever he appeard The
singular thing however was that he did not appear as often as the
other men who were on board He seemed to stay a great deal with
Strangeways who shared his suite of rooms and never came on deck
Sometimes the Gazelles prettily reproached him Adelia Louise suggested
to the others that his lack of advantages in the past had made him feel
rather awkward and embarrassed but Palford knew he was not embarrassed
He accepted his own limitations too simply to be disturbed by them
Palford would have been extremely bored by him if he had been of the
type of young outsider who is anxiouus about himself and expansive in
selfrevelation and appeals for advice but sometimes Tembaroms air of
frankness which was really the least expansive thing in the world and
revealed nothing whatever besides concealing everything it chose made
him feel himself almost irritatingly baffled It would have been more
natural if he had not been able to keep anything to himself and had
really talked too much




CHAPTER X


The necessary business in London having been transacted Tembarom went
north to take possession of the home of his forefathers It had rained
for two days before he left London and it rained steadily all the way
to Lancashire and was raining steadily when he reached Temple
Barholm He had never seen such rain before It was the quiet unmoved
persistence of it which amazed him As he sat in the railroad carriage
and watched the slanting lines of its unabating downpour he felt that
Mr Palford must inevitably make some remark upon it But Mr Palford
continued to read his newspapers undisturbedly as though the condition
of atmosphere surrounding him were entirely accustomed and natural It
was of course necessary and proper that he should accompany his client
to his destination but the circumstances of the case made the whole
situation quite abnormal Throughout the centuries each Temple Barholm
had succeeded to his estate in a natural and conventional manner He had
either been welcomed or resented by his neighbors his tenants and his
family and proper and fitting ceremonies had been observed But here
was an heir whom nobody knew whose very existence nobody had even
suspected a young man who had been an outcast in the streets of the
huge American city of which lurid descriptions are given Even in
New York he could have produced no circle other than Mrs Bowses
boardinghouse and the objects of interest to the uptown page so
he brought no one with him for Strangeways seemed to have been
mysteriously disposed of after their arrival in London

Never had Palford  Grimby on their hands a client who seemed so
entirely alone What Mr Palford asked himself would he do in the
enormity of Temple Barholm which always struck one as being a place
almost without limit But that after all was neither here nor there
There he was You cannot undertake to provide a man with relatives if he
has none or with acquaintances if people do not want to know him His
past having been so extraordinary the neighborhood would naturally be
rather shy of him At first through mere force of custom and respect
for an old name punctilious if somewhat alarmed politeness would be
shown by most people but after the first calls all would depend upon
how much people could stand of the man himself

The aspect of the country on a wet winters day was not enlivening The
leafless and dripping hedges looked like bundles of sticks the huge
trees which in June would be majestic bowers of greenery now held
out great skeleton arms which seemed to menace both earth and sky
Heavyfaced laborers tramped along muddy lanes cottages with soaked
bits of dead gardens looked like hovels big melancholy carthorses
dragging jolting carts along the country roads hung their heads as they
splashed through the mire

As Tembarom had known few persons who had ever been out of America he
had not heard that England was beautiful and he saw nothing which led
him to suspect its charms London had impressed him as gloomy dirty
and behind the times despite its pretensions the country struck him as
the limit Hully gee was he going to be expected to spend his life in
this Should he be obliged to spend his life in it Hed find that out
pretty quick and then if there was no hardandfast law against it
him for little old New York again if he had to give up the whole
thing and live on ten per If he had been a certain kind of youth his
discontent would have got the better of him and he might have talked a
good deal to Mr Palford and said many disparaging things

But the man was born here he reflected I guess he doesnt know
anything else and thinks its all right Ive heard of English fellows
who didnt like New York He looks like that kind

He had supplied himself with newspapers and tried to read them Their
contents were as unexciting as the rainsodden landscape There were no
headlines likely to arrest any mans attention There was a lot about
Parliament and the Court and one of them had a column or two about
what lords and ladies were doing a sort of English uptown or downtown
page

He knew the stuff but there was no snap in it and there were no
photographs or descriptions of dresses Galton would have turned it
down He could never have made good if he had done no better than that
He grinned to himself when he read that the king had taken a drive and
that a baby prince had the measles

I wonder what theyd think of the Sunday Earth he mentally inquired

He would have been much at sea if he had discovered what they
really would have thought of it They passed through smokevomiting
manufacturing towns where he saw many legs seemingly bearing about
umbrellas but few entire people they whizzed smoothly past drenched
suburbs wet woodlands and endlesslooking brown moors covered with
dead bracken and bare and prickly gorse He thought these last great
desolate stretches worse than all the rest

But the railroad carriage was luxuriously upholstered and comfortable
though one could not walk about and stretch his legs In the afternoon
Mr Palford ordered in tea and plainly expected him to drink two cups
and eat thin bread and butter He felt inclined to laugh though the tea
was all right and so was the bread and butter and he did not fail his
companion in any respect The inclination to laugh was aroused by the
thought of what Jim Bowles and Julius would say if they could see old T
T with nothing to do at 430 but put in cream and sugar as though he
were at a teaparty on Fifth Avenue

But gee this rain did give him the Willies If he was going to be
sorry for himself he might begin right now But he wasnt He was going
to see this thing through

The train had been continuing its smooth whir through fields wooded
lands and queer deadandalive little villages for some time before it
drew up at last at a small station Bereft by the season of its garden
bloom and green creepers it looked a bare and uninviting little place
On the two benches against the wall of the platform a number of women
sat huddled together in the dampness Several of them held children in
their laps and all stared very hard nudging one another as he descended
from the train A number of rustics stood about the platform giving it
a somewhat crowded air It struck Tembarom that for an outoftheway
place there seemed to be a good many travelers and he wondered if
they could all be going away He did not know that they were the curious
element among such as lived in the immediate neighborhood of the station
and had come out merely to see him on his first appearance Several of
them touched their hats as he went by and he supposed they knew Palford
and were saluting him Each of them was curious but no one was in
a particularly welcoming mood There was indeed no reason for
anticipating enthusiasm It was however but human nature that the
bucolic mind should bestir itself a little in the desire to obtain a
view of a Temple Barholm who had earned his living by blacking boots and
selling newspapers unknowing that he was one o th gentry

When he stepped from his firstclass carriage Tembarom found himself
confronted by a very straight cleanfaced and wellbuilt young man
who wore a long fawncolored livery coat with claret facings and silver
buttons He touched his cockaded hat and at once took up the Gladstone
bags Tembarom knew that he was a footman because he had seen something
like him outside restaurants theaters and shops in New York but he
was not sure whether he ought to touch his own hat or not He slightly
lifted it from his head to show there was no ill feeling and then
followed him and Mr Palford to the carriage waiting for them It was a
severe but sumptuous equipage and the coachman was as well dressed
and well built as the footman Tembarom took his place in it with many
mental reservations

What are the illustrations on the doors he inquired

The Temple Barholm coat of arms Mr Palford answered The people
at the station are your tenants Members of the family of the stout man
with the broad hat have lived as yeoman farmers on your land for three
hundred years

They went on their way with more rain more rain more dripping hedges
more soaked fields and more bare hugearmed trees CLOP CLOP CLOP
sounded the horses hoofs along the road and from his corner of the
carriage Mr Palford tried to make polite conversation Faces peered out
of the windows of the cottages sometimes a whole family group of faces
all crowded together eager to look from the mother with a baby in her
arms to the old man or woman plainly grandfather or grandmothersharp
childishly round or bleared old eyes all excited and anxious to catch
glimpses

They are very curious to see you said Mr Palford Those two
laborers are touching their hats to you It will be as well to recognize
their salute

At a number of the cottage doors the group stood upon the threshold and
touched foreheads or curtsied Tembarom saluted again and again and
more than once his friendly grin showed itself It made him feel queer
to drive along turning from side to side to acknowledge obeisances as
he had seen a wellknown military hero acknowledge them as he drove down
Broadway

The chief street of the village of Temple Barholm wandered almost within
hailing distance of the great entrance to the park The gates were
supported by massive pillars on which crouched huge stone griffins
Tembarom felt that they stared savagely over his head as he was driven
toward them as for inspection and in disdainful silence allowed to
pass between them as they stood on guard apparently with the haughtiest
mental reservations

The park through which the long avenue rolled concealed its beauty to
the unaccustomed eye showing only more bare trees and sodden stretches
of brown grass The house itself as it loomed up out of the thickening
rainmist appalled Tembarom by its size and gloomily gray massiveness
Before it was spread a broad terrace of stone guarded by more griffins
of even more disdainful aspect than those watching over the gates The
stone noses held themselves rigidly in the air as the reporter of the
uptown society page passed with Mr Palford up a flight of steps broad
enough to make him feel as though he were going to church Footmen with
powdered heads received him at the carriage door seemed to assist him
to move to put one foot before the other for him to stand in rows as
though they were a military guard ready to take him into custody

Then he was inside standing in an enormous hall filled with furnishings
such as he had never seen or heard of before Carved oak suits of
armor stone urns portraits another flight of church steps mounting
upward to surrounding galleries stainedglass windows tigers and
lions heads horns of tremendous size strange and beautiful weapons
suggested to him that the dream he had been living in for weeks had
never before been so much a dream He had walked about as in a vision
but among familiar surroundings Mrs Bowses boarders and his hall
bedroom had helped him to retain some hold over actual existence But
here the reverently saluting villagers staring at him through windows
as though he were General Grant the huge stone entrance the drive
of what seemed to be ten miles through the park the gloomy mass of
architecture looming up the regiment of liveried menservants with
respectfully lowered but excitedly curious eyes the dark and solemn
richness inclosing and claiming himall this created an atmosphere
wholly unreal As he had not known books its parallel had not been
suggested to him by literature He had literally not heard that such
things existed Selling newspapers and giving every moment to the
struggle for life or living one did not come within the range of
splendors He had indeed awakened in that other world of which he had
spoken And though he had heard that there was another world he had had
neither time nor opportunity to make mental pictures of it His life so
far had expressed itself in another language of figures The fact that
he had in his veins the blood of the Norman lords and Saxon kings may or
may not have had something to do with the fact that he was not abashed
but bewildered The same factor may or may not have aided him to
preserve a certain stoic outward composure Who knows what remote
influences express themselves in common acts of modern common life
As Cassivellaunus observed his surroundings as he followed in captive
chains his conquerors triumphal car through the streets of Rome so
the keeneyed product of New York pavement life took in all about
him Existence had forced upon him the habit of sharp observance The
fundamental working law of things had expressed itself in the simple
colloquialism Keep your eye skinned and dont give yourself away In
what phrases the parallel of this concise advice formulated itself in
55 BC no classic has yet exactly informed us but doubtless something
like it was said in ancient Rome Tembarom did not give himself away
and he took rapid if uncertain inventory of people and things He
remarked for instance that Palfords manner of speaking to a servant
was totally different from the manner he used in addressing himself It
was courteous but remote as though he spoke across an accepted chasm
to beings of another race There was no hint of incivility in it
but also no hint of any possibility that it could occur to the person
addressed to hesitate or resent It was a subtle thing and Tembarom
wondered how he did it

They were shown into a room the walls of which seemed built of books
the furniture was rich and grave and luxuriously comfortable A fire
blazed as well as glowed in a fine chimney and a table near it was set
with a glitter of splendid silver urn and equipage for tea

Mrs Butterworth was afraid you might not have been able to get tea
sir said the manservant who did not wear livery but whose butlers
air of established authority was more impressive than any fawn color and
claret enriched with silver could have encompassed

Tea again Perhaps one was obliged to drink it at regular intervals
Tembarom for a moment did not awaken to the fact that the man was
speaking to him as the master from whom orders came He glanced at Mr
Palford

Mr Temple Barholm had tea after we left Crowly Mr Palford said He
will no doubt wish to go to his room at once Burrill

Yes sir said Burrill with that note of entire absence of comment
with which Tembarom later became familiar Pearson is waiting

It was not unnatural to wonder who Pearson was and why he was waiting
but Tembarom knew he would find out There was a slight relief on
realizing that tea was not imperative He and Mr Palford were led
through the hall again The carriage had rolled away and two footmen
who were talking confidentially together at once stood at attention
The staircase was more imposing as one mounted it than it appeared as
one looked at it from below Its breadth made Tembarom wish to lay
a hand on a balustrade which seemed a mile away He had never
particularly wished to touch balustrades before At the head of the
first flight hung an enormous piece of tapestry its forest and hunters
and falconers awakening Tembaroms curiosity as it looked wholly unlike
any picture he had ever seen in a shopwindow There were pictures
everywhere and none of them looked like chromos Most of the people in
the portraits were in fancy dress Rumors of a New York millionaire ball
had given him some vague idea of fancy dress A lot of them looked like
freaks He caught glimpses of corridors lighted by curious high deep
windows with leaded panes It struck him that there was no end to the
place and that there must be rooms enough in it for a hotel

The tapestry chamber of course Burrill he heard Mr Palford say in
a low tone

Yes sir Mr Temple Barholm always used it

A few yards farther on a door stood open revealing an immense room
rich and gloomy with tapestrycovered walls and dark oak furniture A
bed which looked to Tembarom incredibly big with its carved oak canopy
and massive posts had a presiding personality of its own It was
mounted by steps and its hangings and coverlid were of embossed velvet
timesoftened to the perfection of purples and blues A fire enriched
the color of everything and did its best to drive the shadows away
Deep windows opened either into the leafless boughs of closegrowing
trees or upon outspread spaces of heavily timbered park where gaunt
though magnificent bare branches menaced and defied A slim neat young
man with a rather pale face and a touch of anxiety in his expression
came forward at once

This is Pearson who will valet you exclaimed Mr Palford

Thank you sir said Pearson in a low respectful voice His manner
was correctness itself

There seemed to Mr Palford to be really nothing else to say He wanted
in fact to get to his own apartment and have a hot bath and a rest
before dinner

Where am I Burrill he inquired as he turned to go down the corridor

The crimson room sir answered Burrill and he closed the door of the
tapestry chamber and shut Tembarom in alone with Pearson




CHAPTER XI


For a few moments the two young men looked at each other Pearsons gaze
being one of respectfulness which hoped to propitiate if propitiation
was necessary though Pearson greatly trusted it was not Tembaroms was
the gaze of hasty investigation and inquiry He suddenly thought that
it would have been all to the merry if somebody had put him on to
a sort of idea of what was done to a fellow when he was valeted A
valet he had of course gathered waited on one somehow and looked after
ones clothes But were there by chance other things he expected to
domanicure ones nails or cut ones hairand how often did he do
it and was this the day He was evidently there to do something or he
wouldnt have been waiting behind the door to pounce out the minute he
appeared and when the other two went away Burrill wouldnt have closed
the door as solemnly as though he shut the pair of them in together to
get through some sort of performance

Heres where T T begins to feel like a fool he thought And heres
where theres no way out of looking like one I dont know a thing

But personal vanity was not so strong in him as healthy and normal good
temper Despite the fact that the neat correctness of Pearsons style
and the finished expression of his neat face suggested that he was of
a class which knew with the most finished exactness all that custom
and propriety demanded on any occasion on which valeting in its most
occult branches might be done he was only another fellow after all
and must be human So Tembarom smiled at him

Hello Pearson he said How are you

Pearson slightly started It was the tiniest possible start quite
involuntary from which he recovered instantly to reply in a tone of
respectful gratefulness

Thank you sir very well thank you sir

Thats all right answered Tembarom a sense of relief because hed
got started increasing the friendliness of his smile I see you got
my trunk open he said glancing at some articles of clothing neatly
arranged upon the bed

Pearson was slightly alarmed It occurred to him suddenly that perhaps
it was not the custom in America to open a gentlemans box and lay out
his clothes for him For special reasons he was desperately anxious
to keep his place and above all things he felt he must avoid giving
offense by doing things which by being too English might seem to cast
shades of doubt on the entire correctness of the customs of America He
had known ill feeling to arise between gentlemens gentlemen in the
servants hall in the case of slight differences in customs contested
with a bitterness of feeling which had made them almost an international
question There had naturally been a great deal of talk about the new
Mr Temple Barholm and what might be expected of him When a gentleman
was not a gentlemanthis was the form of expression in the
hallthe Lord only knew what would happen And this one who had for
all one knew been born in a workhouse and had been a bootblack kicked
about in American streetsthey did not know Tembaromand nearly
starved to death and found at last in a low lodginghouse what could
he know about decent living And ten to one hed be American enough to
swagger and bluster and pretend he knew everything better than any one
else and lose his temper frightfully when he made mistakes and try
to make other people seem to blame Set a beggar on horseback and who
didnt know what he was There were chances enough and to spare that not
one of them would be able to stand it and that in a months time they
would all be looking for new places

So while Tembarom was rather afraid of Pearson and moved about in an
awful state of uncertainty Pearson was horribly afraid of Tembarom and
was in fact in such a condition of nervous anxiety that he was obliged
more than once furtively to apply to his damp pale young forehead his
exceedingly fresh and spotless pockethandkerchief

In the first place there was the wardrobe What COULD he do How could
he approach the subject with sufficient delicacy Mr Temple Barholm had
brought with him only a steamer trunk and a Gladstone bag the latter
evidently bought in London to be stuffed with hastily purchased
handkerchiefs and shirts worn as they came out of the shop and as
evidently bought without the slightest idea of the kind of linen a
gentleman should own What most terrified Pearson who was of a timid
and most delicateminded nature was that having the workhouse and the
bootblacking as a background the new Mr Temple Barholm COULDNT know
as all this had come upon him so suddenly And was it to be Pearsons
calamitous duty to explain to him that he had NOTHING that he
apparently KNEW nothing and that as he had no friends who knew a mere
common servant must educate him if he did not wish to see him
derided and looked down upon and actually cut by gentlemen that
WERE gentlemen All this to say nothing of Pearsons own wellearned
reputation for knowledge of custom intelligence and deftness in
turning out the objects of his care in such form as to be a reference in
themselves when a new place was wanted Of course sometimes there
were even real gentlemen who were most careless and indifferent to
appearance and who if left to themselves would buy garments which
made the blood run cold when one realized that his own character and
hopes for the future often depended upon his latest employers outward
aspect But the ulster in which Mr Temple Barholm had presented himself
was of a cut and material such as Pearsons most discouraged moments
had never forced him to contemplate The limited wardrobe in the steamer
trunk was all new and all equally bad There was no evening dress
no proper linennot what Pearson called properno proper toilet
appurtenances What was Pearson called upon by duty to do If he
had only had the initiative to anticipate this he might have asked
permission to consult in darkest secrecy with Mr Palford But he had
never dreamed of such a situation and apparently he would be obliged
to send his new charge down to his first dinner in the majestically
decorous diningroom before all the servants in a sort of speckled
tweed cutaway with a brown necktie

Tembarom realizing without delay that Pearson did not expect to be
talked to and being cheered by the sight of the fire sat down before
it in an easychair the like of which for luxurious comfort he had never
known He was in fact waiting for developments Pearson would say or
do something shortly which would give him a chance to catch on or
perhaps hed go out of the room and leave him to himself which would be
a thing to thank God for Then he could wash his face and hands brush
his hair and wait till the dinnerbell rang Theyd be likely to have
one Theyd have to in a place like this

But Pearson did not go out of the room He moved about behind him for
a short time with footfall so almost entirely soundless that Tembarom
became aware that if it went on long he should be nervous in fact
he was nervous already He wanted to know what he was doing He could
scarcely resist the temptation to turn his head and look but he did
not want to give himself away more entirely than was unavoidable and
besides instinct told him that he might frighten Pearson who looked
frightened enough in a neat and wellmannered way already Hully gee
how he wished he would go out of the room

But he did not There were gently gliding footsteps of Pearson behind
him quiet movements which would have seemed stealthy if they had been
a burglars soft removals of articles from one part of the room to
another delicate brushings and almost noiseless foldings Now Pearson
was near the bed now he had opened a wardrobe now he was looking into
the steamer trunk now he had stopped somewhere behind him within a few
yards of his chair Why had he ceased moving What was he looking at
What kept him quiet

Tembarom expected him to begin stirring mysteriously again but he did
not Why did he not There reigned in the room entire silence no soft
footfalls no brushing no folding Was he doing nothing Had he got
hold of something which had given him a fit There had been no sound of
a fall but perhaps even if an English valet had a fit hed have it so
quietly and respectfully that one wouldnt hear it Tembarom felt that
he must be looking at the back of his head and he wondered what was
the matter with it Was his hair cut in a way so unEnglish that it
had paralyzed him The back of his head began to creep under an
investigation so prolonged No sound at all no movement Tembarom
stealthily took out his watchgood old Waterbury he wasnt going to
part withand began to watch the minutehand If nothing happened
in three minutes he was going to turn round Onetwothreeand the
silence made it seem fifteen He returned his Waterbury to his pocket
and turned round

Pearson was not dead He was standing quite still and resigned waiting
It was his business to wait not to intrude or disturb and having put
everything in order and done all he could do he was waiting for further
commandsin some suspense it must be admitted

Hello exclaimed Tembarom involuntarily

Shall I get your bath ready sir inquired Pearson Do you like it
hot or cold sir

Tembarom drew a relieved breath He hadnt dropped dead and he hadnt
had a fit and here was one of the things a man did when he valeted
youhe got your bath ready A hasty recollection of the muchused
paintsmeared tin bath on the fourth floor of Mrs Bowses
boardinghouse sprang up before him Everybody had to use it in turn
and you waited hours for the chance to make a dash into it No one stood
still and waited fifteen minutes until you got good and ready to tell
him he could go and turn on the water Gee whizz

Being relieved himself he relieved Pearson by telling him he might fix
it for him and that he would have hot water

Very good sir Thank you sir said Pearson and silently left the
room

Then Tembarom got up from his chair and began to walk about rather
restlessly A new alarm seized him Did Pearson expect to WASH him or
to stand round and hand him soap and towels and things while he washed
himself

If it was supposed that you hadnt the strength to turn the faucets
yourself it might be supposed you didnt have the energy to use a
fleshbrush and towels Did valeting include a kind of shampoo all over

I couldnt stand for that he said Id have to tell him thered been
no Turkish baths in mine and Im not trained up to them When Ive got
on to this kind of thing a bit more Ill make him understand what Im
NOT in for but I dont want to scare the life out of him right off He
looks like a good little fellow

But Pearsons duties as valet did not apparently include giving him
his bath by sheer physical force He was deft calm amenable He led
Tembarom down the corridor to the bathroom revealed to him stores of
sumptuous bathrobes and towels hotand coldwater faucets sprays
and tonic essences He forgot nothing and having prepared all mutely
vanished and returned to the bedroom to waitand gaze in troubled
wonder at the speckled tweed cutaway There was an appalling
possibilityhe was aware that he was entirely ignorant of American
customsthat tweed was the fashionable home evening wear in the States
Tembarom returning from his bath much refreshed after a warm plunge and
a cold shower evidently felt that as a costume it was all that could be
desired

Will you wearthese sirthis evening Pearson suggested

It was suggestive of more than actual inquiry If he had dared to hope
that his manner might suggest a number of things For instance that
in England gentlemen really didnt wear tweed in the evening even in
private That through some unforeseen circumstances his employers
eveningdress suit had been delayed but would of course arrive
tomorrow

But Tembarom physically stimulated by hot and cold water and relief at
being left alone was beginning to recover his natural buoyancy

Yes Ill wear em he answered snatching at his hairbrush and
beginning to brush his damp hair It was a woodenbacked brush that
Pearson had found in his Gladstone bag and shudderingly laid in
readiness on the dressingtable I guess theyre all right aint
they

Oh quite right sir quite Pearson venturedfor morning wear

Morning said Tembarom brushing vigorously Not night

Black sir most delicately hinted Pearson ismore usualin the
eveningin England After which he added So to speak with a vague
hope that the mollifying phrase might counteract the effect of any
apparently implied aspersion on colors preferred in America

Tembarom ceased brushing his hair and looked at him in goodnatured
desire for information

Frockcoats or clawhammer he asked Despite his natural anxiety
and in the midst of it Pearson could not but admit that he had an
uncondemnatory voice and a sort of young way with him which gave one
courage But he was not quite sure of clawhammer

Frockcoats for morning dress and afternoon wear sir he ventured
The evening cut as you know is

Clawhammer Swallowtail I guess you say here Tembarom ended for
him quite without hint of rancor he was rejoiced to see

Yes sir said Pearson

The ceremony of dressing proved a fearsome thing as it went on Pearson
moved about deftly and essayed to do things for the new Mr Temple
Barholm which the new Mr Temple Barholm had never heard of a man not
doing for himself He reached for things Pearson was about to hand to
him or hold for him He unceremoniously achieved services for himself
which it was part of Pearsons manifest duty to perform They got into
each others way there was even danger sometimes of their seeming to
snatch things from each other to Pearsons unbounded horror Mr Temple
Barholm did not express any irritation whatsoever misunderstandings took
place but he held his mouth rather closeshut and Pearson not aware
that he did this as a precaution against open grinning or shouts of
laughter as he found himself unable to adjust himself to his attendants
movements thought it possible that he was secretly annoyed and regarded
the whole matter with disfavor But when the dressing was at an end and
he stood ready to go down in all his innocent ignoring of speckled tweed
and brown necktie he looked neither flurried nor out of humor and
he asked a question in a voice which was actually friendly It was a
question dealing with an incident which had aroused much interest in the
servants hall as suggesting a touch of mystery

Mr Strangeways came yesterday all right didnt he he inquired

Yes sir Pearson answered Mr Hutchinson and his daughter came
with him They call her Little Ann Hutchinson Shes a sensible little
thing sir and she seemed to know exactly what youd want done to make
him comfortable Mrs Butterworth put him in the west room sir and
I valeted him He was not very well when he came but he seems better
today sir only hes very anxious to see you

Thats all right said Tembarom You show me his room Ill go and
see him now

And being led by Pearson he went without delay




CHAPTER XII


The chief objection to Temple Barholm in Tembaroms mind was that it
was too big for any human use That at least was how it struck him The
entrance was too big the stairs were too wide the rooms too broad
and too long and too high to allow of eyes accustomed to hall bedrooms
adjusting their vision without discomfort The diningroom in which the
new owner took his first meal in company with Mr Palford and attended
by the large serious man who wore no livery and three tall footmen who
did was of a size and stateliness which made him feel homesick for
Mrs Bowses diningroom with its two hurried incompetent and
oftenchanged waitresses and its prevailing friendly custom of pushing
things across the table to save time Meals were quickly disposed of at
Mrs Bowses Everybody was due uptown or downtown and regarded food
as an unavoidable because necessary interference with more urgent
business At Temple Barholm one sat half the nightthis was the
impression made upon Tembaromwatching things being brought in and
taken out of the room carved on a huge buffet and passed from one man
to another and when they were brought solemnly to you if you turned
them down it seemed that the whole ceremony had to be gone through with
again All sorts of silver knives forks and spoons were given to one
and taken away and half a dozen sorts of glasses stood by your plate
and if you made a move to do anything for yourself the man out of
livery stopped you as though you were too big a fool to be trusted
The food was all right but when you knew what anything was and were
inclined to welcome it as an old friend it was given to you in some
way that made you get rattled With all the swell dishes you had
no butterplate and ice seemed scarce and the dead still way the
servants moved about gave you a sort of feeling that you were at a
funeral and that it wasnt decent to talk so long as the remains were
in the room The headman and the footmen seemed to get on by signs
though Tembarom never saw them making any and their faces never changed
for a moment Once or twice he tried a joke addressing it to Mr
Palford to see what would happen But as Mr Palford did not seem to
see the humor of it and gave him the glassy eye and neither the
headman nor the footmen seemed to hear it he thought that perhaps they
didnt know it was a joke and if they didnt and they thought anything
at all they must think he was dippy The dinner was a deadly though
sumptuous meal and long drawn out when measured by meals at Mrs
Bowses He did not know as Mr Palford did that it was perfect and
served with a finished dexterity that was also perfection

Mr Palford however was himself relieved when it was at an end He had
sat at dinner with the late Mr Temple Barholm in his day and had seen
him also served by the owners of impassive countenances but he had been
aware that whatsoever of secret dislike and resentment was concealed by
them there lay behind their immovability an acceptance of the fact
that he represented even in his most objectionable humors centuries of
accustomedness to respectful service and of knowledge of his right and
power to claim it The solicitor was keenly aware of the silent comments
being made upon the tweed suit and brown necktie and on the manner in
which their wearer boldly chose the wrong fork or erroneously made use
of a knife or spoon Later in the evening in the servants hall the
comment would not be silent and there could be no doubt of what
its character would be There would be laughter and the relating
of incidents Housemaids and stillroom maids would giggle and
kitchenmaids and bootboys would grin and whisper in servile tribute to
the witticisms of the superior servants

After dinner the rest of the evening could at least be spent in talk
about business matters There still remained details to be enlarged upon
before Palford himself returned to Lincolns Inn and left Mr Temple
Barholm to the care of the steward of his estate It was not difficult
to talk to him when the sole subject of conversation was of a business
nature

Before they parted for the night the mystery of the arrangements made
for Strangeways had been cleared In fact Mr Temple Barholm made no
mystery of them He did not seem ignorant of the fact that what he had
chosen to do was unusual but he did not appear hampered or embarrassed
by the knowledge His remarks on the subject were entirely civil and
were far from actually suggesting that his singular conduct was purely
his own business and none of his solicitors but for a moment or so
Mr Palford was privately just a trifle annoyed The Hutchinsons had
traveled from London with Strangeways in their care the day before He
would have been unhappy and disturbed if he had been obliged to travel
with Mr Palford who was a stranger to him and Miss Hutchinson had
a soothing effect on him Strangeways was for the present comfortably
installed as a guest of the house Miss Hutchinson having talked to the
housekeeper Mrs Butterworth and to Pearson What the future held for
him Mr Temple Barholm did not seem to feel the necessity of going into
He left him behind as a subject and went on talking cheerfully of other
things almost as if he had forgotten him

They had their coffee in the library and afterward sat at the
writingtable and looked over documents and talked until Mr Palford
felt that he could quite decorously retire to his bedroom He was glad
to be relieved of his duties and Tembarom was amiably resigned to
parting with him

Tembarom did not go upstairs at once himself He sat by the fire and
smoked several pipes of tobacco and thought things over There were
a lot of things to think over and several decisions to make and he
thought it would be a good idea to pass them in review The quiet of
the dead surrounded him In a house the size of this the servants
were probably half a mile away Theyd need trolleys to get to one he
thought if you rang for them in a hurry If an armed burglar made a
quiet entry without your knowing it he could get in some pretty rough
work before any of the seventyfive footmen could come to lend a hand
He was not aware that there were two of them standing in waiting in the
hall their powdered heads close together so that their whispers and
chuckles could be heard A sound of movement in the library would have
brought them up standing to a decorous attitude of attention conveying
to the uninitiated the impression that they had not moved for hours

Sometimes as he sat in the big morocco chair T Tembarom looked grave
enough sometimes he looked as though he was confronting problems which
needed puzzling out and with which he was not making much headway
sometimes he looked as though he was thinking of little Ann Hutchinson
and not infrequently he grinned Here he was up to the neck in it and
he was darned if he knew what he was going to do He didnt know a soul
and nobody knew him He didnt know a thing he ought to know and he
didnt know any one who could tell him Even the Hutchinsons had never
been inside a place like Temple Barholm and they were going back to
Manchester after a few weeks stay at the grandmothers cottage

Before he had left New York he had seen Hadman and some other fellows
and got things started so that there was an even chance that the
invention would be put on its feet He had worked hard and used his own
power to control money in the future as a lever which had proved to be
exactly what was needed

Hadman had been spurred and a little startled when he realized the
magnitude of what really could be done and saw also that this slangy
moneyed youth was not merely an enthusiastic fool but saw into business
schemes pretty sharply and was of a most determined readiness With this
power ranging itself on the side of Hutchinson and his invention it was
good business to begin to move if one did not want to run a chance of
being left out in the cold

Hutchinson had gone to Manchester and there had been barely time for
a brief but characteristic interview between him and Tembarom when he
rushed back to London Tembarom felt rather excited when he remembered
it recalling what he had felt in confronting the struggles against
emotion in the bluntfeatured red face the breaks in the rough voice
the charging up and down the room like a curiously elated bull in a
china shop and the big effort to restrain relief and gratitude the
degree of which might seem to undervalue the merits of the invention
itself

Once or twice when he looked serious Tembarom was thinking this
over and also once or twice when he grinned Relief and gratitude
notwithstanding Hutchinson had kept him in his place and had not
made unbounded efforts to conceal his sense of the incongruity of his
position as the controller of fortunes and the lord of Temple Barholm
which was still vaguely flavored with indignation

When he had finished his last pipe Tembarom rose and knocked the ashes
out of it

Now for Pearson he said

He had made up his mind to have a talk with Pearson and there was no
use wasting time If things didnt suit you the best thing was to see
what you could do to fix them right awayif it wasnt against the law
He went out into the hall and seeing the two footmen standing waiting
he spoke to them

Say I didnt know you fellows were there he said Are you waiting
up for me Well you can go to bed the sooner the quicker Good night
And he went upstairs whistling

The glow and richness and ceremonial order of preparation in his
bedroom struck him as soon as he opened the door Everything which could
possibly have been made ready for his most luxurious comfort had been
made ready He did not it is true care much for the huge bed with its
carved oak canopy and massive pillars

But the lyingdown part looks about all right he said to himself

The fine linen the soft pillows the downy blankets would have allured
even a man who was not tired The covering had been neatly turned back
and the snowy whiteness opened That was English he supposed They
hadnt got on to that at Mrs Bowses

But I guess a plain little old New York sleep will do he said
Temple Barholm or no Temple Barholm I guess they cant change that

Then there sounded a quiet knock at the door He knew who it would
turn out to be and he was not mistaken Pearson stood in the corridor
wearing his slightly anxious expression but ready for orders

Mr Temple Barholm looked down at him with a friendly if unusual air

Say Pearson he announced if youve come to wash my face and put my
hair up in crimpingpins you neednt do it because Im not used to it
But come on in

If he had told Pearson to enter and climb the chimney it cannot be said
that the order would have been obeyed upon the spot but Pearson would
certainly have hesitated and explained with respectful delicacy the fact
that the task was not his place He came into the room

I came to see if I could do anything further and making a
courageous onslaught upon the situation for which he had been preparing
himself for hoursand alsoif it is not too lateto venture to
trouble you with regard to your wardrobe He coughed a low embarrassed
cough In unpacking sir I foundI did not find

You didnt find much did you Tembarom assisted him

Of course sir Pearson apologized leaving New York so hurriedly
youryour man evidently had not time toer

Tembarom looked at him a few seconds longer as if making up his mind to
something Then he threw himself easily into the big chair by the fire
and leaned back in it with the frankest and bestnatured smile possible

I hadnt any man he said Say Pearson waving his hand to another
chair near by suppose you take a seat

Long and careful training came to Pearsons aid and supported him but
he was afraid that he looked nervous and certainly there was a lack of
entire calm in his voice

Ithank you sirI think Id better stand sir

Why inquired Tembarom taking his tobaccopouch out of his pocket and
preparing to fill another pipe

Youre most kind sir butbut in impassioned embarrassmentI
should really PREFER to stand sir if you dont mind I should feel
moremore at ome sir he added dropping an h in his agitation

Well if youd like it better thats all right yielded Mr Temple
Barholm stuffing tobacco into the pipe Pearson darted to a table
produced a match struck it and gave it to him

Thank you said Tembarom still goodnaturedly But there are a few
things Ive GOT to say to you RIGHT now

Pearson had really done his best his very best but he was terrified
because of the certain circumstances once before referred to

I beg pardon sir he appealed but I am most anxious to give
satisfaction in every respect He WAS poor young man horribly
anxious Today being only the first day I dare say I have not been
all I should have been I have never valeted an American gentleman
before but Im sure I shall become accustomed to everything QUITE
soonalmost immediately

Say broke in Tembarom youre way off Im not complaining Youre
all right

The easy good temper of his manner was so singularly assuring that
Pearson unexplainable as he found him in every other respect knew that
this at least was to be depended upon and he drew an almost palpable
breath of relief Something actually allured him into approaching what
he had never felt it safe to approach before under like circumstancesa
confidential disclosure

Thank you sir I am most grateful Thefact is I hoped especially to
be able to settle in place just now IIm hoping to save up enough to
get married sir

You are Tembarom exclaimed Good business So was I before all
thishe glanced about himfell on top of me

Ive been saving for three years sir and if I can know Im a
permanencyif I can keep this place

Youre going to keep it all right Tembarom cheered him up with If
youve got an idea youre going to be fired just you forget it Cut it
right out

IsI beg your pardon sir Pearson asked with timorous joy but is
that the American for saying youll be good enough to keep me on

Mr Temple Barholm thought a second

Is keep me on the English for let me stay

Yes sir

Then were all right Lets start from there Im going to have a
hearttoheart talk with you Pearson

Thank you sir said Pearson in a deferential murmur But if he was
not dissatisfied what was going to happen

Itll save us both trouble and me most Im not one of those clever
Clarences that can keep up a bluff making out I know things I dont
know I couldnt deceive a setting hen or a Berlin wool antimacassar

Pearson swallowed something with effort

You see I fell into this thing KERCHUNK and Im just RATTLEDIm
rattled As Pearson slightly coughed again he translated for him
Thats American for I dont know where Im at

Those American jokes sir are very funny indeed answered Pearson
appreciatively

Funny the new Mr Temple Barholm exclaimed even aggrievedly If you
think this layout is an American joke to me Pearson theres where
youre way off Do you think it a merry jest for a fellow like me to
sit up in a high chair in a diningroom like a cathedral and not know
whether he ought to bite his own bread or not And not dare to stir
till things are handed to him by five husky footmen I thought that
plainclothes man was going to cut up my meat and slap me on the back
if I choked

Pearsons sense of humor was perhaps not inordinate but unseemly mirth
which he had swallowed at the reference to the setting hen and the
Berlin wool antimacassar momentarily got the better of him despite
his efforts to cough it down and broke forth in a hoarse illrepressed
sound

I beg pardon sir he said with a laudable endeavor to recover his
professional bearing Its yourAmerican way of expressing it which
makes me forget myself I beg pardon

Tembarom laughed outright boyishly

Oh cut that out he said Say how old are you

Twentyfive sir

So am I If youd met me three months ago beating the streets of New
York for a living with holes in my shoes and a celluloid collar on
youd have looked down on me I know you would

Oh no sir most falsely insisted Pearson

Oh yes you would protested Tembarom cheerfully Youd have said
I talked through my nose and I should have laughed at you for dropping
your hs Now youre rattled because Im Mr Temple Temple Barholm but
youre not half as rattled as I am

Youll get over it sir almost immediately Pearson assured him
hopefully

Of course I shall said Tembarom with much courage But to start
right Ive got to get over YOU

Me sir Pearson breathed anxiously

Yes Thats what I want to get off my chest Now first off you came
in here to try to explain to me that owing to my New York valet having
left my New York wardrobe behind Ive not got anything to wear and so
I shall have to buy some clothes

I failed to find any dressshirts sir began Pearson hesitatingly

Mr Temple Barholm grinned

I always failed to find them myself I never had a dressshirt I never
owned a suit of glad rags in my life

Glglad rags sir stammered Pearson uncertainly

I knew you didnt catch on when I said that to you before dinner
I mean clawhammer and dresssuit things Dont you be frightened
Pearson I never had six good shirts at once or two pair of shoes or
more than four tencent handkerchiefs at a time since I was born And
when Mr Palford yanked me away from New York he didnt suspect a
fellow could be in such a state And I didnt know I was in a state
anyhow I was too busy to hunt up people to tell me because I was
rushing something important right through and I couldnt stop I just
bought the first things I set eyes on and crammed them into my trunk
There I guess you know the most of this but you didnt know I knew you
knew it Now you do and you neednt be afraid to hurt my feelings by
telling me I havent a darned thing I ought to have You can go straight
ahead

As he leaned back puffing away at his pipe he had thrown a leg over
the arm of his chair for greater comfort and it really struck his valet
that he had never seen a gentleman more at his ease even one who WAS
one His casual candidness produced such a relief from the sense of
strain and uncertainty that Pearson felt the color returning to his
face An opening had been given him and it was possible for him to do
his duty

If you wish sir I will make a list he ventured further and the
proper firms will send persons to bring things down from London on
appro

Whats appro the English for

Approval sir

Good business Good old Pearson

Thank you sir Shall I attend to it tonight to be ready for the
morning post

In five minutes you shall But you threw me off the track a bit The
thing I was really going to say was more important than the clothes
business

There was something else then thought Pearson some other unexpected
point of view

What have you to do for me anyhow

Valet you sir

Thats English for washing my face and combing my hair and putting my
socks on aint it

Well sir it means doing all you require and being always in
attendance when you change

How much do you get for it

Thirty shillings a week sir

Say Pearson said Tembarom with honest feeling Ill give you sixty
shillings a week NOT to do it

Calmed though he had felt a few moments ago it cannot be denied that
Pearson was aghast How could one be prepared for developments of such
an order

Not to do it sir he faltered But what would the servants think if
you had no one to valet you

Thats so What would they think But he evidently was not dismayed
for he smiled widely I guess the plainclothes man would throw a fit

But Pearsons view was more serious and involved a knowledge of not
improbable complications He knew the hall and its points of view

I couldnt draw my wages sir he protested Thered be the greatest
dissatisfaction among the other servants sir if I didnt do my duties
Theres always aa slight jealousy of valets and ladiesmaids The
general idea is that they do very little to earn their salaries Ive
seen them fairly hated

Is that so Well Ill be darned remarked Mr Temple Barholm He
gave a moment to reflection and then cheered up immensely

Ill tell you how well fix it You come up into my room and bring your
tatting or read a newspaper while I dress He openly chuckled Holy
smoke Ive GOT to put on my shirt and swear at my collarbuttons
myself If Im in for having a trained nurse do it for me itll give me
the Willies When you danced around me before dinner

Pearsons horror forced him to commit the indiscretion of interrupting

I hope I didnt DANCE sir he implored I tried to be extremely
quiet

That was it said Tembarom I shouldnt have said danced I meant
crept I kept thinking I should tread on you and I got so nervous
toward the end I thought I should just break down and sob on your bosom
and beg to be taken back to home and mother

Im extremely sorry sir I am indeed apologized Pearson doing his
best not to give way to hysterical giggling How was a man to keep a
decently straight face and if one didnt where would it end One thing
after another

It was not your fault It was mine I havent a thing against you
Youre a firstrate little chap

I will try to be more satisfactory tomorrow

There must be no laughing aloud even if one burst a bloodvessel It
would not do Pearson hastily confronted a vision of a young footman
or Mr Burrill himself passing through the corridors on some errand
and hearing master and valet shouting together in unseemly and wholly
incomprehensible mirth And the next remark was worse than ever

No you wont Pearson Mr Temple Barholm asserted Theres where
youre wrong Ive got no more use for a valet than I have for a pair of
straightfront corsets

This contained a sobering suggestion

But you said sir that

Oh Im not going to fire you said Tembarom genially Ill keep
you on but little Willie is going to put on his own socks If the
servants have to be pacified you come up to my room and do anything
you like Lie on the bed if you want to get a jewsharp and play on
itany old thing to pass the time And Ill raise your wages What do
you say Is it fixed

Im here sir to do anything you require Pearson answered
distressedly but Im afraid

Tembaroms face changed A sudden thought had struck him

Ill tell you one thing you can do he said you can valet that
friend of mine

Mr Strangeways sir

Yes Ive got a notion he wouldnt mind it He was not joking now He
was in fact rather suddenly thoughtful

Say Pearson what do you think of him

Well sir Ive not seen much of him and he says very little but I
should think he was a GENTLEMAN sir

Mr Temple Barholm seemed to think it over

Thats queer he said as though to himself Thats what Ann said
Then aloud Would you say he was an American

In his unavoidable interest in a matter much talked over below stairs
and productive of great curiosity Pearson was betrayed He could not
explain to himself after he had spoken how he could have been such a
fool as to forget but forget himself and the birthplace of the new Mr
Temple Barholm he did

Oh no sir he exclaimed hastily hes QUITE the gentleman sir
even though he is queer in his mind The next instant he caught himself
and turned cold An American or a Frenchman or an Italian in fact a
native of any country on earth so slighted with an unconsciousness so
natural if he had been a man of hot temper might have thrown something
at him or kicked him out of the room but Mr Temple Barholm took his
pipe out of his mouth and looked at him with a slow broadening smile

Would you call me a gentleman Pearson he asked

Of course there was no retrieving such a blunder Pearson felt but

Certainly sir he stammered Mostmost CERTAINLY sir

Pearson said Tembarom shaking his head slowly with a grin so
goodnatured that even the frankness of his words was friendly humor
itselfPearson youre a liar But that doesnt jolt me a bit I dare
say Im not one anyhow We might put an ad in one of your papers and
find out

II beg your pardon sir murmured Pearson in actual anguish of mind

Mr Temple Barholm laughed outright

Oh Ive not got it in for you How could you help it he said Then
he stopped joking again If you want to please ME he added with
deliberation you look after Mr Strangeways and dont let anything
disturb him Dont bother him but just find out what he wants When he
gets restless come and tell me If Im out tell him Im coming back
Dont let him worry You understanddont let him worry

Ill do my bestmy very best sir Pearson answered devoutly Ive
been nervous and excited this first day because I am so anxious to
pleaseeverything seems to depend on it just now he added daring
another confidential outburst But youll see I do know how to keep my
wits about me in general and Ive got a good memory and I have learned
my duties sir Ill attend to Mr Strangeways most particular

As Tembarom listened and watched his neat blond countenance and
noted the undertone of quite desperate appeal in his low voice he was
thinking of a number of things Chiefly he was thinking of little Ann
Hutchinson and the Harlem flat which might have been run on fifteen
dollars a week

I want to know I have some one in this museum of a place wholl
UNDERSTAND he saidsome one wholl do just exactly what I say and
ask no fool questions and keep his mouth shut I believe you could do
it

Ill swear I could sir Trust me was Pearsons astonishingly
emotional and hasty answer

Im going to returned Mr Temple Barholm Ive set my mind on
putting something through in my own way Its a queer thing and most
people would say I was a fool for trying it Mr Hutchinson does but
Miss Hutchinson doesnt

There was a note in his tone of saying Miss Hutchinson doesnt which
opened up vistas to Pearsonstrange vistas when one thought of old Mrs
Hutchinsons cottage and the estate of Temple Barholm

Were just about the same age his employer continued and in a sort
of way were in just about the same fix

Their eyes looked into each others a second but it was not for Pearson
to presume to make any comment whatsoever upon the possible nature of
the fix Two or three more puffs and Mr Temple Barholm spoke again

Say Pearson I dont want to butt in but what about that little bunch
of calico of yoursthe one youre saving up for

Calico sir said Pearson at sea but hopeful Whatsoever the new Mr
Temple Barholm meant one began to realize that it was not likely to be
unfriendly

Thats American for HER Pearson Her stands for the same thing both
in English and American I guess Whats her name and where is she
Dont you say a word if you dont want to

Pearson drew a step nearer There was an extraordinary human atmosphere
in the room which caused things to begin to go on in his breast He had
had a harder life than Tembarom because he had been more timid and less
buoyant and less unselfconscious He had been beaten by a drunken mother
and kicked by a drunken father He had gone hungry and faint to the
board school and had been punished as a dull boy After he had struggled
into a place as page he had been bullied by footmen and had had his
ears boxed by cooks and butlers Ladiesmaids and smart housemaids had
sneered at him and made him feel himself a hopeless vulgar little worm
who never would get on But he had got on in a measure because he
had worked like a slave and openly resented nothing A place like this
had been his fevered hope and dream from his page days though of course
his imagination had not encompassed attendance on a gentleman who had
never owned a dressshirt in his life Yet gentleman or no gentleman he
was a Temple Barholm and there was something about him something human
in his young voice and grin and queer unheardof New York jokes which
Pearson had never encountered and which had the effect of making him
feel somehow more of a man than his timorous nature had ever allowed of
his feeling before It suggested that they were both valet and master
merely masculine human creatures of like kind The way he had said Miss
Hutchinson and the twinkle in his eye when hed made that American
joke about the little bunch of calico The curious fact was that thin
neat whitebloodedlooking Pearson was passionately in love So he took
the step nearer and grew hot and spoke low

Her name is Rose Merrick sir and shes in place in London Shes
ladysmaid to a lady of title and it isnt an easy place Her lady has
a high temper and shes economical with her servants Her maid has
to sew early and late and turn out as much as if she was a whole
dressmaking establishment Shes clever with her needle and it would
be easier if she felt it was appreciated But shes treated haughty
and severe though she tries her very best She has to wait up half
the night after balls and Im afraid its breaking her spirit and
her health Thats whyI beg your pardon sir he added his voice
shakingthats why Id bear anything on earth if I could give her a
little home of her own

Gee whizz ejaculated Mr Temple Barholm with feeling I guess you
would

And thats not all sir said Pearson Shes a beautiful girl sir
with a figure and service is sometimes not easy for a young woman
like that His lordshipthe master of the house siris much too
attentive Hes a man with bad habits the last ladysmaid was sent
away in disgrace Her ladyship wouldnt believe she hadnt been forward
when she saw things she didnt like though every one in the hall knew
the girl hated his bold ways with her and her mother nearly broke her
heart Hes begun with Rose and it just drives me mad sir it does

He choked and wiped his forehead with his clean handkerchief It was
damp and his young eyes had fire in them as Mr Temple Barholm did not
fail to observe

Im taking a liberty talking to you like this sir he said Im
behaving as if I didnt know my place sir

Your place is behind that fellow kicking him till hell never sit down
again except on eiderdown cushions three deep remarked Mr Temple
Barholm with fire in his eyes also Thats where your place is Its
where mine would be if I was in the same house with him and caught him
making a goat of himself I bet nine Englishmen out of ten would break
his darned neck for him if they got on to his little ways even if they
were lordships themselves

The decent ones wont know Pearson said Thats not what happens
sir He can laugh and chaff it off with her ladyship and coax her round
But a girl thats discharged like that Rose says thats the worst of
it she says shes got a character fastened on to her for life that no
respectable man ought to marry her with

Mr Temple Barholm removed his leg from the arm of his chair and got up
Longlegged sinewy but somewhat slouchy in his badly made tweed suit
sharp New York face and awful American style notwithstanding he still
looked rather nice as he laid his hand on his valets shoulder and gave
him a friendly push

See here he said What youve got to say to Rose is that shes just
got to cut that sort of thing outcut it right out Talking to a man
thats in love with her as if he was likely to throw her down because
lies were told Tell her to forget itforget it quick Why what does
she suppose a mans FOR by jinks Whats he FOR

Ive told her that sir though of course not in American I just swore
it on my knees in Hyde Park one night when she got out for an hour But
she laid her poor head on the back of the bench and cried and wouldnt
listen She says she cares for me too much to

Tembaroms hand clutched his shoulder His face lighted and glowed
suddenly

Care for you too much he asked Did she say that God bless her

Thats what I said broke in Pearson

I heard another girl say thatjust before I left New Yorka girl
thats just a wonder said his master A girl can be a wonder cant
she

Rose is sir protested Pearson She is indeed sir And her eyes
are that blue

Blue are they interrupted Tembarom I know the kind Im on to the
whole thing And whats more Im going to fix it You tell Roseand
tell her from methat shes going to leave that place and youre going
to stay in this one andwell presently thingsll begin to happen
Theyre going to be all rightALL RIGHT he went on with immensely
convincing emphasis Shes going to have that little home of her own
He paused a moment for reflection and then a sudden thought presented
itself to him Why darn it he exclaimed there must be a whole raft
of little homes that belong to me in one place or another Why couldnt
I fix you both up in one of them

Oh sir Pearson broke forth in some slight alarm He went so fast
and so far all in a moment And Pearson really possessed a neat
wellordered conscience and moreover knew his place I hope I
didnt seem to be expecting you to trouble yourself about me sir I
mustnt presume on your kindness

Its not kindness itswell its just human Im going to think this
thing over You just keep your hair on and let me do my own valeting
and youll see Ill fix it for you somehow

What he thought of doing how he thought of doing it and what Pearson
was to expect the agitated young man did not know The situation was of
course abnormal judged by all respectable longestablished custom A
mans valet and his valets young woman were not usually of intimate
interest Gentlemen were sometimes kind to yougave you half a
sovereign or even a sovereign and perhaps asked after your mother if
you were supporting one but

I never dreamed of going so far sir he said I forgot myself Im
afraid

Good thing you did Its made me feel as if we were brothers He
laughed again enjoying the thought of the little thing who cared for
Pearson too much and had eyes that were that blue Say Ive just
thought of something else Have you bought her an engagementring yet

No sir In our class of life jewelry is beyond the means

I just wondered Mr Temple Barholm said He seemed to be thinking of
something that pleased him as he fumbled for his pocketbook and took a
clean banknote out of it Im not on to what the value of this thing is
in real money but you go and buy her a ring with it and I bet shell
be so pleased youll have the time of your life

Pearson taking it and recognizing its value in UNreal money was
embarrassed by feeling the necessity of explanation

This is a fivepound note sir Its too much sir it is indeed This
would FURNISH THE FRONT PARLOR He said it almost solemnly

Mr Temple Barholm looked at the note interestedly

Would it By jinks and his laugh had a certain softness of
recollection I guess thats just what Ann would say Shed know what
it would furnish you bet your life

Im most grateful sir protested Pearson but I oughtnt to take
it Being an American gentleman and not accustomed to English money you
dont realize that

Im not accustomed to any kind of money said his master Im scared
to be left alone in the room with it Thats whats the matter If I
dont give some away I shall never know Ive got it Cheer up Pearson
You take that and buy the ring and when you start furnishing Ill see
you dont get left

I dont know what to say sir Pearson faltered emotionally I dont
indeed

Dont say a darned thing replied Mr Temple Barholm And just here
his face changed as Mr Palford had seen it change before and as
Pearson often saw it change later His New York jocular irreverence
dropped from him and he looked mature and oddly serious

Ive tried to sort of put you wise to the way Ive lived and the things
I HAVENT had ever since I was born he said but I guess you dont
really know a thing about it Ive got more money coming in every year
than a thousand of me would ever expect to see in their lives according
to my calculation And I dont know how to do any of the things a fellow
who is what you call a gentleman would know how to do I mean in the
way of spending it Now Ive got to get some fun out of it I should
be a mutt if I didnt so Im going to spend it my own way I may make
about seventyfive different kinds of a fool of myself but I guess I
shant do any particular harm

Youll do good sirto every one

Shall Isaid Tembarom speculatively Well Im not exactly setting
out with that in my mind Im no Young Mens Christian Association but
Im not in for doing harm anyway You take your fivepound notecome
to think of it Palford said it came to about twentyfive dollars real
money Hully gee I never thought Id have twentyfive dollars to GIVE
AWAY It makes me feel like I was Morgan

Thank you sir thank you said Pearson putting the note into his
pocket with rapt gratitude in his neat face Youyou do not wish me to
remainto do anything for you

Not a thing But just go and find out if Mr Strangeways is asleep If
he isnt and seems restless Ill come and have a talk with him

Yes sir said Pearson and went at once




CHAPTER XIII


In the course of two days Mr Palford having given his client the
benefit of his own exact professional knowledge of the estate of
Temple Barholm and its workings and privileges as far as he found them
transferable and likely to be understood returned to London breathing
perhaps something like a sigh of relief when the train steamed out
of the little station Whatsoever happened in days to come Palford 
Grimby had done their most trying and awkward duty by the latest Temple
Barholm Bradford who was the steward of the estate would now take
him over and could be trusted to furnish practical information of any
ordinary order

It did not appear to Mr Palford that the new inheritor was particularly
interested in his possessions or exhilarated by the extraordinary turn
in his fortunes The enormity of Temple Barholm itself regarded as a
house to live in in an everyday manner seemed somewhat to depress him
When he was taken over its hundred and fifty rooms he wore a detached
air as he looked about him and such remarks as he made were of an
extraordinary nature and expressed in terms peculiar to America Neither
Mr Palford nor Burrill understood them but a young footman who was
said to have once paid a visit to New York and who chanced to be in the
picturegallery when his new master was looking at the portraits of
his ancestors overhearing one observation was guilty of a convulsive
snort and immediately made his way into the corridor coughing
violently From this Mr Palford gathered that one of the transatlantic
jokes had been made That was the New York ideato be jocular Yet he
had not looked jocular when he had made the remark which had upset the
equilibrium of the young footman He had in fact looked reflective
before speaking as he stood and studied a portrait of one of his
ancestors But then he had a trick of saying things incomprehensibly
ridiculous with an unmoved expression of gravity which led Palford to
feel that he was ridiculous through utter ignorance and was not aware
that he was exposing the fact Persons who thought that an air of
seriousness added to a humorous remark were especially annoying to the
solicitor because they frequently betrayed one into the position
of seeming to be dull in the matter of seeing a point That he had
observed was often part of the New York mannerto make a totally
absurdly exaggerated or seemingly ignorancerevealing observation and
then leave ones hearer to decide for himself whether the speaker was an
absolute ignoramus and fool or a humorist

More than once he had somewhat suspected his client of meaning to get
a rise out of him after the odious manner of the tourists described
in The Innocents Abroad though at the same time he felt rather
supportingly sure of the fact that generally when he displayed
ignorance he displayed it because he was a positive encyclopedia of
lack of knowledge

He knew no more of social customs literature and art than any other
street lad He had not belonged to the aspiring selftaught who
meritoriously haunt the night schools and free libraries with a view
to improving their minds If this had been his method he might in one
sense have been more difficult to handle as Palford had seen the
thing result in a bumptiousness most objectionable He was markedly not
bumptious at all events

A certain degree of interest in or curiosity concerning his ancestors
as represented in the picturegallery Mr Palford had observed He had
stared at them and had said queer thingssometimes things which perhaps
indicated a kind of uneducated thought The fact that some of them
looked so thoroughly alive and yet had lived centuries ago seemed
to set him reflecting oddly His curiosity however seemed to connect
itself with them more as human creatures than as historical figures

What did that one do he inquired more than once What did he start
or didnt he start anything

When he disturbed the young footman he had stopped before a dark man in
armor

Whos this fellow in the tin overcoat he asked seriously and
Palford felt it was quite possible that he had no actual intent of being
humorous

That is Miles Gaspard Nevil John who fought in the Crusades with
Richard Coeur de Lion he explained He is wearing a suit of armor
By this time the footman was coughing in the corridor

Thats English history I guess Tembarom replied Ill have to get a
historybook and read up about the Crusades

He went on farther and paused with a slightly puzzled expression before
a boy in a costume of the period of Charles II

Whos this Fauntleroy in the lace collar he inquired Queer he
added as though to himself I cant ever have seen him in New York
And he took a step backward to look again

That is Miles Hugo Charles James who was a page at the court of
Charles II He died at nineteen and was succeeded by his brother Denzel
Maurice John

I feel as if Id had a dream about him sometime or other said
Tembarom and he stood still a few seconds before he passed on Perhaps
I saw something like him getting out of a carriage to go into the Van
Twillers fancydress ball Seems as if Id got the whole show shut up
in here And you say theyre all my own relations Then he laughed If
they were alive now he said By jinks

His laughter suggested that he was entertained by mental visions But he
did not explain to his companion His legal adviser was not in the least
able to form any opinion of what he would do how he would be likely to
comport himself when he was left entirely to his own devices He
would not know also one might be sure that the county would wait with
repressed anxiety to find out If he had been a minor he might have
been taken in hand and trained and educated to some extent But he was
not a minor

On the day of Mr Palfords departure a thick fog had descended and
seemed to enwrap the world in the white wool Tembarom found it close to
his windows when he got up and he had dressed by the light of tall wax
candles the previous Mr Temple Barholm having objected to more modern
and vulgar methods of illumination

I guess this is what you call a London fog he said to Pearson

No not exactly the London sort sir Pearson answered A London fog
is yellowwhen it isnt brown or black It settles on the hands and
face A fog in the country isnt dirty with smoke Its much less
trying sir

When Palford had departed and he was entirely alone Tembarom found a
country fog trying enough for a man without a companion A degree of
relief permeated his being with the knowledge that he need no
longer endeavor to make suitable reply to his solicitors efforts at
conversation He had made conversational efforts himself You couldnt
let a man feel that you wouldnt talk to him if you could when he was
doing business for you but what in thunder did you have to talk about
that a man like that wouldnt be bored stiff by He didnt like New
York he didnt know anything about it and he didnt want to know and
Tembarom knew nothing about anything else and was homesick for the very
stones of the roaring citys streets When he said anything Palford
either didnt understand what he was getting at or he didnt like it
And he always looked as if he was watching to see if you were trying to
get a joke on him Tembarom was frequently not nearly so much inclined
to be humorous as Mr Palford had irritably suspected him of being His
modes of expression might on numerous occasions have roused to mirth
when his underlying idea was almost entirely serious The mode of
expression was merely a result of habit

Mr Palford left by an extremely early train and after he was gone
Tembarom sat over his breakfast as long as possible and then going to
the library smoked long The library was certainly comfortable though
the fire and the big wax candles were called upon to do their best to
defy the chill mysterious dimness produced by the heavy white wool
curtain folding itself more and more thickly outside the windows

But one cannot smoke in solitary idleness for much more than an hour
and when he stood up and knocked the ashes out of his last pipe
Tembarom drew a long breath

Theres a hundred and thirtysix hours in each of these days he said
Thats nine hundred and fiftytwo in a week and four thousand and
eighty in a monthwhen its got only thirty days in it Im not going
to calculate how many thered be in a year Ill have a look at the
papers Theres Punch Thats their comic one

He looked out the American news in the London papers and sighed hugely
He took up Punch and read every joke two or three times over He did not
know that the number was a specially good one and that there were some
extremely witty things in it The jokes were about bishops in gaiters
about gardenparties about curates or lovely young ladies or rectors
wives and rustics about Royal Academicians or esthetic poets Their
humor appealed to him as little and seemed as obscure as his had seemed
to Mr Palford

Im not laughing my head off much over these he said I guess Im
not on to the point

He got up and walked about The L in New York was roaring to and fro
loaded with men and women going to work or to do shopping Some of them
were devouring morning papers bearing no resemblance to those of London
some of them carried parcels and all of them looked as though they were
intent on something or other and hadnt a moment to waste They were all
going somewhere in a hurry and had to get back in time for something
When the train whizzed and slackened at a station some started up
hastily caught their papers or bundles closer and pushed or were pushed
out on the platform which was crowded with other people who rushed to
get in and if they found seats dropped into them hastily with an air
of relief The streetcars were loaded and rang their bells loudly
trucks and carriages and motors filled the middle of the thoroughfares
and people crowded the pavements The store windows were dressed up for
Christmas and most of the people crowded before them were calculating
as to what they could get for the inadequate sums they had on hand

The breakfast at Mrs Bowses boardinghouse was over and the boarders
had gone on cars or elevated trains to their days work Mrs Bowse
was getting ready to go out and do some marketing Julius and Jim were
downtown deep in the work pertaining to their separate jobs Theyd
go home at night and perhaps if they were in luck would go to a
show somewhere and afterward come and sit in their tilted chairs in
the hall bedroom and smoke and talk it over And he wouldnt be there
and the Hutchinsons rooms would be empty unless some new people were
in them Galton would be sitting among his papers working like mad And
Bennettwell Bennett would be either getting out his page or would
be rushing about in the hundredth streets to find items and follow up
weddings or receptions

Gee he said every one of them trying their best to put something
over and with so much to think of theyve not got time to breathe Itd
be no trouble for THEM to put in a hundred and thirtysix hours Theyd
be darned glad of them And believe me theyd put something over
too before they got through And Im here with three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year round my neck and not a thing to spend it on
unless I pay some one part of it to give me lessons in tatting What is
tatting anyhow

He didnt really know It was vaguely supposed to imply some intensely
feminine fancywork done by old ladies and used as a figure of speech
in jokes

If you could ride or shoot you could amuse yourself in the country
Palford had said

I can ride in a streetcar when Ive got five cents Tembarom had
answered Thats as far as Ive gone in ridingand what in thunder
should I shoot

Game replied Mr Palford with chill inward disgust Pheasants
partridges woodcock grouse

I shouldnt shoot anything like that if I went at it he responded
shamelessly I should shoot my own head off or the fellows that stood
next to me unless he got the drop on me first

He did not know that he was ignominious Nobody could have made it clear
to him He did not know that there were men who had gained distinction
popularity and fame by doing nothing in particular but hitting things
animate and inanimate with magnificent precision of aim

He stood still now and listened to the silence

Theres not a sound within a thousand miles of the place What do
fellows with money DO to keep themselves alive he said piteously
Theyve got to do SOMETHING Shall I have to go out and take a walk as
Palford called it Take a walk by gee

He couldnt conceive it a man taking a walk as though it were
medicinea walk nowhere to reach nothing just to go and turn back
again

Ill begin and take in sewing he said or Ill open a store in the
villagea department store I could spend something on that Ill ask
Pearson what he thinks of itor Burrill Id like to see Burrill if I
said that to him

He decided at last that he would practise his short awhile that would
be doing something at any rate He sat down at the big writingtable
and began to dash off mystic signs at furious speed But the speed did
not keep up The silence of the great room of the immense house of all
the scores of rooms and galleries and corridors closed in about him He
had practised his short in the night school with the L thundering
past at intervals of five minutes in the newspaper office with all the
babel of New York about him and the bang of steamdrills going on
below in the next lot where the foundation of a new building was being
excavated he had practised it in his hall bedroom at Mrs Bowses
to the tumultuous accompaniment of street sounds and the whizz and
TINGALING of streetcars dashing past and he had not been disturbed
He had never practised it in any place which was silent and it was the
silence which became more than he could stand He actually jumped out
of his chair when he heard mysterious footsteps outside the door and a
footman appeared and spoke in a low voice which startled him as though
it had been a thunderclap

A young person with her father wants to see you sir he announced I
dont think they are villagers but of the workingclass I should say

Where are they

I didnt know exactly what to do sir so I left them in the hall The
young person has a sort of quiet determined way

Little Ann by gee exclaimed Tembarom with mad joy and shot out of
the room

The footmanhe had not seen Little Ann when she had brought
Strangewayslooked after him and rubbed his chin

Wouldnt you call that a rummy sort for Temple Barholm he said to one
of his fellows who had appeared in the hall near him

Its not my sort was the answer Im going to give notice to old
Butterworth

Hutchinson and Little Ann were waiting in the hall Hutchinson was
looking at the rich shadowy spaces about him with a sort of proud
satisfaction Fine dark corners with armored figures lurking in
them ancient portraits carved oak settles and massive chairs and
cabinetsthese were English and he was an Englishman and somehow felt
them the outcome of certain sterling qualities of his own He looked
robustly well and wore a new rough tweed suit such as one of the gentry
might tramp about muddy roads and fields in Little Ann was dressed
in something warm and rough also a brown thing with a little close
caplike brown hat from under which her red hair glowed The walk in
the cold white fog had made her bloom fresh softred and whitedaisy
color She was smiling and showing three distinct dimples which
deepened when Tembarom dashed out of the library

Hully gee he cried out but Im glad to see you

He shook hands with both of them furiously and two footmen stood and
looked at the group with imagelike calm of feature but with curiously
interested eyes Hutchinson was aware of them and endeavored to present
to them a back which by its stolid composure should reveal that he knew
more about such things than this chap did and wasnt a bit upset by
grandeur

Hully gee cried Tembarom again how glad I am Come on in and sit
down and lets talk it over

Burrill made a stately step forward properly intent on his duty and
his master waved him back

Say he said hastily dont bring in any tea They dont want it
Theyre Americans

Hutchinson snorted He could not stand being consigned to ignominy
before the footmen

Nowt o th sort he broke forth Were noan American Thart losing
tha head lad

Hes forgetting because he met us first in New York said Little Ann
smiling still more

Shall I take your hat and cane sir inquired Burrill unmovedly at
Hutchinsons side

He wasnt going to say anything about tea explained Little Ann as
they went into the library They dont expect to serve tea in the
middle of the morning Mr Temple Barholm

Dont they said Tembarom reckless with relieved delight I thought
they served it every time the clock struck When we were in London it
seemed like Palford had it when he was hot and when he was cold and when
he was glad and when he was sorry and when he was going out and when he
was coming in Its brought up to me by jinks as soon as I wake to
brace me up to put on my clothesand Pearson wants to put those on

He stopped short when they reached the middle of the room and looked her
over

O Little Ann he breathed tumultuously O Little Ann

Mr Hutchinson was looking about the library as he had looked about the
hall

Well I never thought Id get inside Temple Barlholm in my day he
exclaimed Eh lad tha must feel like bull in a china shop

I feel like a whole herd of em answered Tembarom Hutchinson nodded
He understood

Well perhaps thall get over it in time he conceded but itll take
thee a good bit Then he gave him a warmly friendly look Ill lay
you know what Ann came with me for today The way Little Ann looked at
himthe way she looked at him

I came to thank you Mr Temple Barholm she saidto thank you And
there was an odd tender sound in her voice

Dont you do it Ann Tembarom answered Dont you do it

I dont know much about business but the way you must have worked the
way you must have had to run after people and find them and make then
listen and use all your New York clevernessbecause you ARE clever
The way youve forgotten all about yourself and thought of nothing but
father and the invention I do know enough to understand that and it
seems as if I cant think of enough to say I just wish I could tell you
what it means to me Two round pearls of tears brimmed over and fell
down her cheeks I promised mother FAITHFUL Id take care of him and
see he never lost hope about it she added and sometimes I didnt
know whatever I was going to do

It was perilous when she looked at one like that and she was so little
and light that one could have snatched her up in his arms and carried
her to the big armchair and sat down with her and rocked her backward
and forward and poured forth the whole thing that was making him feel as
though he might explode

Hutchinson provided salvation

Tha pulled me out o the water just when I was going under lad God
bless thee he broke out and shook his hand with rough vigor I
signed with the North Electric yesterday

Good business said Tembarom Now Im in on the ground floor with
whats going to be the biggest moneymaker in sight

The way tha talked New York to them chaps took my fancy chuckled
Hutchinson None o them chaps wants to be the first to jump over the
hedge

Weve got em started now exulted Tembarom

Tha started em said Hutchinson and its thee Ive got to thank

Say Little Ann said Tembarom with sudden thought whos come into
money now Youll have it to burn

Weve not got it yet Mr Temple Barholm she replied shaking
her head Even when inventions get started they dont go off like
skyrockets

She knows everything doesnt she Tembarom said to Hutchinson Here
come and sit down Ive not seen you for steen years

She took her seat in the big armchair and looked at him with softly
examining eyes as though she wanted to understand him sufficiently to
be able to find out something she ought to do if he needed help

He saw it and half laughed not quite unwaveringly

Youll make me cry in a minute he said You dont know what its
like to have some one from home and mother come and be kind to you

How is Mr Strangeways she inquired

Hes well taken care of at any rate Thats where hes got to thank
you Those rooms you and the housekeeper chose were the very things for
him Theyre big and comfortable and way off in a place where no ones
likely to come near The fellow thats been hired to valet me valets him
instead and I believe he likes it It seems to come quite natural to
him any how I go in and see him every now and then and try to get
him to talk I sort of invent things to see if I can start him thinking
straight Hes quieted down some and he looks better After a while Im
going to look up some big doctors in London and find out which of
ems got the most plain horse sense If a real big one would just get
interested and come and see him on the quiet and not get him excited he
might do him good Im dead stuck on this stunt Ive set myselfgetting
him right Its something to work on

Youll have plenty to work on soon said Little Ann Theres a lot
of everyday things youve got to think about They may seem of no
consequence to you but they ARE Mr Temple Barholm

If you say they are I guess they are he answered Ill do anything
you say Ann

I came partly to tell you about some of them today she went on
keeping the yearningly thoughtful eyes on him It was rather hard for
her too to be firm enough when there was so much she wanted to say and
do And he did not look half as twinkling and lightheartedly grinning
as he had looked in New York

He couldnt help dropping his voice a little coaxingly though Mr
Hutchinson was quite sufficiently absorbed in examination of his
surroundings

Didnt you come to save my life by letting me have a look at you
Little Anndidnt you he pleaded

She shook her wonderful red head

No I didnt Mr Temple Barholm she answered with Manchester
downrightness When I said what I did in New York I meant it I
didnt intend to hang about here and let yousay things to me You
mustnt say them Father and me are going back to Manchester in a
few days and very soon we have to go to America again because of the
business

America he said Oh Lord he groaned Do you want me to drop down
dead here with a dull sickening thud Ann

Youre not going to drop down dead she replied convincedly Youre
going to stay here and do whatever its your duty to do now youve come
into Temple Barholm

Am I he answered Well well see what Im going to do when Ive had
time to make up my mind It may be something different from what youd
think and it maynt Just now Im going to do what you tell me Go
ahead Little Ann

She thought the matter over with her most destructive little air of
sensible intentness

Well it may seem like meddling but it isnt she began rather
concernedly Its just that Im used to looking after people I wanted
to talk to you about your clothes

My clothes he replied bewildered a moment but the next he
understood and grinned I havent got any My valetthink of T T
with a valettold me so last night

Thats what I thought she said maternally I got Mrs Bowse to write
to me and she told me you were so hurried and excited you hadnt time
for anything

I just rushed into Cohens the last day and yanked a few things off the
readymade counter

She looked him over with impersonal criticism

I thought so Those youve got on wont do at all

Tembarom glanced at them

Thats what Pearson says

Theyre not the right shape she explained I know what a gentlemans
clothes mean in England and her face flushed and sudden warm
spirit made her speak rather fastI couldnt ABIDE to think of you
coming here andbeing made fun ofjust because you hadnt the right
clothes

She said it the little thing as though he were hersher very own and
defend him against disrespect she WOULD Tembarom being but young
flesh and blood made an impetuous dart toward her and checked himself
catching his breath

Ann he said has your grandmother got a dog

Yes she said faltering because she was puzzled

How big is he

Hes a big one Hes a brindled bulldog Why

Well he said half pathetic half defiant if youre going to come
and talk to me like that and look like that youve got to bring that
bull along and set him on me when I make a break for theres nothing
but a dog can keep me where you want me to stayand a big one at that

He sat down on an ottoman near her and dropped his head on his hands It
was not half such a joke as it sounded

Little Ann saw it wasnt and she watched him tenderly catching her
breath once quickly Men had ways of taking some things hard and feeling
them a good bit more than one would think It made trouble many a time
if one couldnt help them to think reasonable

Father she said to Hutchinson

Aye he answered turning round

Will you tell Mr Temple Barholm that you think Im right about giving
him his chance

Of course I think shes right Hutchinson blustered and it isnt the
first time either Im not going to have my lass married into any family
where shed be looked down upon

But that was not what Little Ann wanted it was not in fact her
argument She was not thinking of that side of the situation

Its not me that matters so much Father she said its him

Oh is it disagreed Hutchinson dictatorially Thats not th road
I look at it Im looking after you not him Let him take care of
himself No chap shall put you where you wont be looked up to even if
I AM grateful to him So there you have it

He cant take care of himself when he feels like this she answered
Thats WHY Im taking care of him Hell think steadier when hes
himself again She put out her hand and softly touched his shoulder

Dont do that she said You make me want to be silly There was a
quiver in her voice but she tried to change it If you dont lift
your head she added with a great effort at disciplinarian firmness I
shall have to go away without telling you the other things

He lifted his head but his attempt at a smile was not hilarious

Well Ann he submitted Ive warned you Bring along your dog

She took a sheet of paper out of one of the neat pockets in her rough
brown coat

I just wrote down some of the very best tailors addressesthe very
best she explained Dont you go to any but the very best and be
a bit sharp with them if theyre not attentive Theyll think all the
better of you If your valets a smart one take him with you

Yes Ann he said rather weakly Hes going to make a list of things
himself anyhow

That sounds as if hed got some sense She handed him the list of
addresses You give him this and tell him he must go to the very best
ones

What do I want to put on style for he asked desperately I dont
know a soul on this side of the Atlantic Ocean

You soon will she replied with calm perspicacity Youve got too
much money not to

A gruff chuckle made itself heard from Hutchinsons side of the room

Aye seventy thousand a yearll bring th vultures about thee lad

We neednt call them vultures exactly was Little Anns tolerant
comment but a lot of people will come here to see you That was one of
the things I thought I might tell you about

Say youre a wonder

Im nothing of the sort Im just a girl with a bit of common
senseand grandmothers one thats looked on a long time and she sees
things The country gentlemen will begin to call on you soon and then
youll be invited to their houses to meet their wives and daughters and
then youll be kept pretty busy

Hutchinsons bluff chuckle broke out again

You will that my lad when th matchmaking mothers get after you
Theres plenty on em

Fathers joking she said Her tone was judicially unprejudiced
There are young ladies thatthatd be very suitable Pretty ones and
clever ones Youll see them all

I dont want to see them

You cant help it she said with mild decision When there
are daughters and a new gentleman comes into a big property in the
neighborhood its nothing but natural that the mothers should be a bit
anxious

Aye theyll be anxious enough Mak sure o that laughed Hutchinson

Is that what you want me to put on style for Little Ann Tembarom
asked reproachfully

I want you to put it on for yourself I dont want you to look
different from other men Everybodys curious about you Theyre ready
to LAUGH because you came from America and once sold newspapers

Its the men hell have to look out for Hutchinson put in with an
experienced air Theres them thatll want to borrow money and them
thatll want to drink and play cards and bet high A green American
ladll be a fine pigeon for them to pluck You may as well tell him
Ann you know you came here to do it

Yes I did she admitted I dont want you to seem not to know what
people are up to and what they expect

That little note of involuntary defense was a dangerous thing for
Tembarom He drew nearer

You dont want them to take me for a fool Little Ann Youre standing
up for me thats it

You can stand up for yourself Mr Temple Barholm if youre not taken
by surprise she said confidently If you understand things a bit you
wont be

His feelings almost overpowered him

God bless your dear little soul he broke out Say if this goes on
that dog of your grandmothers wouldnt have a show Ann I should bite
him before he could bite me

I wont go on if you cant be sensible Mr Temple Barholm I shall
just go away and not come back again Thats what I shall do Her tone
was that of a young mother

He gave in incontinently

Good Lord no he exclaimed Ill do anything if youll stay Ill
lie down on the mat and not open my mouth Just sit here and tell me
things I know you wont let me hold your hand but just let me hold a
bit of your dress and look at you while you talk He took a bit of her
brown frock between his fingers and held it gazing at her with all his
crude young soul in his eyes Now tell me he added

Theres only one or two things about the people wholl come to Temple
Barholm Grandmothers talked it over with me She knew all about those
that came in the late Mr Temple Barholms time He used to hate most of
them

Then why in thunder did he ask them to come

He didnt Theyve got clever polite ways of asking themselves
sometimes He couldnt bear the Countess of Mallowe Shell come
Grandmother says you may be sure of that

Whatll she come for

Little Anns pause and contemplation of him were fraught with
thoughtfulness

Shell come for you at last she said

Shes got a daughter she thinks ought to have been married eight years
ago announced Hutchinson

Tembarom pulled at the bit of brown tweed he held as though it were a
drowning mans straw

Dont you drive me to drink Ann he said Im frightened Your
grandmother will have to lend ME the dog

This was a flightiness which Little Ann did not encourage

Lady Joanthats her daughteris very grand and haughty Shes a
great beauty Youll look at her but perhaps she wont look at you But
its not her Im troubled about Im thinking of Captain Palliser and
men like him

Whos he

Hes one of those smooth clever ones thats always getting up some
company or other and selling the stock Hell want you to know his
friends and hell try to lead you his way

As Tembarom held to his bit of her dress his eyes were adoring ones
which was really not to be wondered at She WAS adorable as her soft
kind wonderfully maternal girl face tried to control itself so that it
should express only just enough to help and nothing to disturb

I dont want him to spoil you I dont want anything to make
youdifferent I couldnt bear it

He pulled the bit of dress pleadingly

Why Little Ann he implored quite low

Because she said feeling that perhaps she was rashbecause if
you were different you wouldnt be T Tembarom and it was T Tembarom
thatthat was T Tembarom she finished hastily

He bent his head down to the bit of tweed and kissed it

You just keep looking after me like that he said and theres not
one of them can get away with me

She got up and he rose with her There was a touch of fire in the
forgetmenot blue of her eyes

Just you let them seejust you let them see that youre not one they
can hold light and make use of But there she stopped short looking
up at him He was looking down at her with a kind of matureness in
his expression I neednt be afraid she said You can take care of
yourself I ought to have known that

You did he said smiling but you wanted to sort of help me And
youve done it by gee just by saying that thing about T Tembarom You
set me right on my feet Thats YOU

Before they went away they paid a visit to Strangeways in his remote
undisturbed and beautiful rooms They were in a wing of the house
untouched by any ordinary passing to and fro and the deep windows
looked out upon gardens which spring and summer would crowd with
loveliness from which clouds of perfume would float up to him on days
when the sun warmed and the soft airs stirred the flowers shaking
the fragrance from their full incensecups But the white fog shut out
today even their winter bareness There were light and warmth inside
and every added charm of rich harmony of deep color and comfort made
beautiful There were books and papers waiting to be looked over but
they lay untouched on the writingtable and Strangeways was sitting
close to the biggest window staring into the fog His eyes looked
hungry and hollow and dark Ann knew he was trying to remember
something

When the sound of footsteps reached his ear he turned to look at them
and rose mechanically at sight of Ann But his expression was that of a
man aroused from a dream of faroff places

I remember you he said but hesitated as though making an effort to
recall something

Of course you do said Little Ann You know me quite well I brought
you here Think a bit LittleLittle

Yes he broke forth Of course Little Ann Thank God Ive not
forgotten He took her hand in both his and held it tenderly You have
a sweet little face Its such a wise little face His voice sounded
dreamy

Ann drew him to his chair with a coaxing laugh and sat down by him

Youre flattering me You make me feel quite shy she said You know
HIM too nodding toward Tembarom

Oh yes he replied and he looked up with a smile He is the one who
remembers You said you did He had turned to Tembarom

You bet your life I do Tembarom answered And you will too before
long

If I did not try so hard said Strangeways thoughtfully It seems
as if I were shut up in a room and so many things were knocking at the
doorshundreds of themknocking because they want to be let in I am
damnably unhappydamnably He hung his head and stared at the floor
Tembarom put a hand on his shoulder and gave him a friendly shake

Dont you worry a bit he said You take my word for it Itll all
come back Im working at it myself Strangeways lifted his head

You are the one I know best I trust you But there was the beginning
of a slight drag in his voice I dont alwaysquite recollectyour
name Not quite Good heavens I mustnt forget that

Little Ann was quite ready

You wont she said because its different from other names It
begins with a letterjust a letter and then there is the name Think

Yes yes he said anxiously

Little Ann bent forward and fixed her eyes on his with concentrated
suggestion They had never risked confusing him by any mention of
the new name She began to repeat letters of the alphabet slowly and
distinctly until she reached the letter T

T she ended with much emphasisR S _T_

His expression cleared itself

T he repeated TTembarom R S T How clever you are

Little Anns gaze concentrated itself still more intently

Now youll never forget it again she said because of the T Youll
say the other letters until you come to it R S T

T Tembarom he ended relievedly How you help me He took her hand
and kissed it very gently

We are all going to help you Ann soothed him T Tembarom most of
all

Say Tembarom broke out in an aside to her Im going to come here
and try things on him every day When it seems like he gets on to
something however little a thing it is Im going to follow it up and
see if it wont get somewhere

Ann nodded

Therell be something some day she said Are you quite comfortable
here she asked aloud to Strangeways

Very comfortable thank you he answered courteously They are
beautiful rooms They are furnished with such fine old things This is
entirely Jacobean Its quite perfect He glanced about him And so
quiet No one comes in here but my man and he is a very nice chap I
never had a man who knew his duties better

Little Ann and Tembarom looked at each other

I shouldnt be a bit surprised she said after they had left the room
if it wouldnt be a good thing to get Pearson to try to talk to him now
and then Hes been used to a manservant

Yes answered Tembarom Pearson didnt rattle HIM you bet your
life




CHAPTER XIV


He could not persuade them to remain to take lunch with him The
firmness of Hutchinsons declination was not unconnected with a private
feeling that them footmen chaps ud be on the lookout to see the way
you handled every bite you put in your mouth He couldnt have stood
it dang their impudence Little Ann on her part frankly and calmly
said It wouldnt DO That was all and evidently covered everything

After they had gone the fog lifted somewhat but though it withdrew
from the windows it remained floating about in masses like huge
ghosts among the trees of the park When Tembarom sat down alone
to prolong his lunch with the aid of Burrill and the footmen he was
confronted by these unearthly shapes every time he lifted his eyes to
the window he faced from his place at the table It was an outlook which
did not inspire to cheerfulness and the fact that Ann and her father
were going back to Manchester and later to America left him without even
the simple consolation of a healthy appetite Things were bound to get
better after a while they were BOUND to A fellow would be a fool if
he couldnt fix it somehow so that he could enjoy himself with money to
burn If you made up your mind you couldnt stand the way things were
you didnt have to lie down under them with a thousand or so per
coming in You could fix it so that it would be different By jinks
there wasnt any law against your giving it all to the church but just
enough to buy a flat in Harlem outright if you wanted to But you
werent going to run crazy and do a lot of fool things in a minute and
be sorry the rest of your life Money was money And first and foremost
there was Ann with her round cheeks flushed and her voice all sweet
and queer saying You wouldnt be T Tembarom and it was T Tembarom
thatthat was T Tembarom

He couldnt help knowing what she had begun to say and his own face
flushed as he thought of it He was at that time of life when there
generally happens to be one center about which the world revolves The
creature who passes through this period of existence without watching it
revolve about such a center has missed an extraordinary and singularly
developing experience It is sometimes happy often disastrous but
always more or less developing Speaking calmly detachedly but not
cynically it is a phase During its existence it is the blood in the
veins the sight of the eyes the beat of the pulse the throb of the
heart It is also the day and the night the sun the moon and the
stars heaven and hell the entire universe And it doesnt matter in
the least to any one but the creatures living through it T Tembarom
was in the midst of it There was Ann There was this new crazy thing
which had happened to himthis fool thing as he called it There was
this monstrous magnificent househe knew it was magnificent though
it wasnt his kindthere was old Palford and his solemn talk about
ancestors and the name of Temple Barholm It always reminded him of how
ashamed he had been in Brooklyn of the Temple Temple and how he had
told lies to prevent the fellows finding out about it And there was
seventy thousand pounds a year and there was Ann who looked as soft as
a babyGood Lord how soft shed feel if you got her in your arms and
squeezed herand yet was somehow strong enough to keep him just where
she wanted him to stay and believed he ought to stay until he had
found out That was it She wasnt doing it for any fool little idea of
making herself seem more important she just believed it She was doing
it because she wanted to let him have his chance just as if she were
his mother instead of the girl he was clean crazy about His chance
He laughed outrighta short confident laugh which startled Burrill
exceedingly

When he went back to the library and lighted his pipe he began to stride
up and down as he continued to think it over

I wish she was as sure as I am he said I wish she was as sure of me
as I am of myselfand as I am of her He laughed the short confident
laugh again I wish she was as sure as I am of us both Were all
right Ive got to get through this and find out what its best to do
and Ive got to show her When Ive had my chance good and plenty
us two for little old New York Gee wont it be fine he exclaimed
imaginatively Her going over her bills looking like a peach of a baby
thats trying to knit its brows and adding up and thinking she ought
to economize Shed do it if we had ten million He laughed outright
joyfully Good Lord I should kiss her to death

The simplest process of ratiocination would lead to a realization of
the fact that though he was lonely and uncomfortable he was not in
the least pathetic or sorry for himself His normal mental and
physical structure kept him steady on his feet and his practical and
unsentimental training combining itself with a touch of iron which
centuries ago had expressed itself through some fighting Temple Barholm
and a medium of battleaxes crossbows and spears did the rest

Itd take more than this to get me where Id be down and out Im
feeling fine he said I believe Ill go and take a walk as Palford
says

The fogwreaths in the park were floating away and he went out grinning
and whistling giving Burrill and the footman a nod as he passed them
with a springing young stride He got the door open so quickly that he
left them behind him frustrated and staring at each other

It wasnt our fault said Burrill gloomily Hes never had a door
opened for him in his life This wont do for me

He was away for about an hour and came back in the best of spirits He
had found out that there was something in taking a walk if a fellow
had nothing else to do The park was fine and he had never seen
anything like it When there were leaves on the trees and the grass
and things were green it would be better than Central Park itself
You could have baseball matches in it What a cinch it would be if you
charged gatemoney But he supposed you couldnt if it belonged to you
and you had three hundred and fifty thousand a year You had to get used
to that But it did seem a fool business to have all that land and not
make a cent out of it If it was just outside New York and you cut it
up into lots youd just pile it up He was quite innocentcalamitously
innocent and commercial and awful in his views Thoughts such as these
had been crammed into his brain by life ever since he had gone down the
staircase of the Brooklyn tenement with his twentyfive cents in his
tenyearold hand

The stillness of the house seemed to have accentuated itself when he
returned to it His sense of it let him down a little as he entered The
library was like a tomba comfortable luxurious tomb with a bright fire
in it A new Punch and the morning papers had been laid upon a table
earlier in the day and he sat down to look at them

I guess about fiftyseven or eight of the hundred and thirtysix hours
have gone by he said But gee aint it lonesome

He sat so still trying to interest himself in London Day by Day in the
morning paper that the combination of his exercise in the fresh air and
the warmth of the fire made him drowsy He leaned back in his chair and
closed his eyes without being aware that he did so He was on the verge
of a doze

He remained upon the verge for a few minutes and then a soft rustling
sound made him open his eyes

An elderly little lady had timidly entered the room She was neatly
dressed in an oldfashioned and farfromnew black silk dress with a
darned lace collar and miniature brooch at her neck She had also thin
gray sideringlets dangling against her cheeks from beneath a small
black lace cap with palepurple ribbons on it She had most evidently
not expected to find any one in the room and having seen Tembarom
gave a halffrightened cough

II beg your pardon she faltered I really did not mean to
intrudereally

Tembarom jumped up awkward but goodnatured Was she a kind of servant
who was a lady

Oh thats all right he said

But she evidently did not feel that it was all right She looked as
though she felt that she had been caught doing something wrong and must
properly propitiate by apology

Im so sorry I thought you had gone outMr Temple Barholm

I did go outto take a walk but I came in

Having been discovered in her overt act she evidently felt that
duty demanded some further ceremony from her She approached him very
timidly but with an exquisite little elderly earlyVictorian manner
She was of the most astonishingly perfect type though Tembarom was not
aware of the fact The manner a century earlier would have expressed
itself in a curtsy

It is Mr Temple Barholm isnt it she inquired

Yes it has been for the last few weeks he answered wondering why
she seemed so in awe of him and wishing she didnt

I ought to apologize for being here she began

Say dont please he interrupted What I feel is that it ought to
be up to me to apologize for being here

She was really quite flurried and distressed

Oh please Mr Temple Barholm she fluttered proceeding to explain
hurriedly as though he without doubt understood the situation I
should of course have gone away at once after the late Mr Temple
Barholm died butbut I really had nowhere to goand was kindly
allowed to remain until about two months ago when I went to make
a visit I fully intended to remove my little belongings before you
arrived but I was detained by illness and could not return until this
morning to pack up I understood you were in the park and I remembered
I had left my knittingbag here She glanced nervously about the room
and seemed to catch sight of something on a remote corner table Oh
there it is May I take it she said looking at him appealingly It
was a kind present from a dear lost friend andand She paused
seeing his puzzled and totally noncomprehending air It was plainly the
first moment it had dawned upon her that he did not know what she was
talking about She took a small alarmed step toward him

Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in delicate anguish Im afraid
you dont know who I am Perhaps Mr Palford forgot to mention me
Indeed why should he mention me There were so many more important
things I am a sort of distantVERY distant relation of yours My name
is Alicia Temple Barholm

Tembarom was relieved But she actually hadnt made a move toward the
knittingbag She seemed afraid to do it until he gave her permission
He walked over to the corner table and brought it to her smiling
broadly

Here it is he said Im glad you left it Im very happy to be
acquainted with you Miss Alicia

He was glad just to see her looking up at him with her timid refined
intensely feminine appeal Why she vaguely brought back something that
reminded him of Ann he could not have told He knew nothing whatever of
types earlyVictorian or late

He took her hand evidently to her greatest possible amazement and
shook it heartily She knew nothing whatever of the New York street
type and it made her gasp for breath but naturally with an allayed
terror

Gee he exclaimed wholeheartedly Im glad to find out Ive got a
relation I thought I hadnt one in the world Wont you sit down He
was drawing her toward his own easychair But he really didnt know
she was agitatedly thinking She really must tell him He seemed so good
tempered andand DIFFERENT She herself was not aware of the enormous
significance which lay in that word different There must be no risk
of her seeming to presume upon his lack of knowledge

It is MOST kind of you she said with grateful emphasis but I
mustnt sit down and detain you I can explain in a few wordsif I
may

He positively still held her hand in the oddest natural boyish
way and before she knew what she was doing he had made her take the
chairquite MADE her

Well just sit down and explain he said I wish to thunder you
would detain me Take all the time you like I want to hear all about
ithonest Injun

There was a cushion in the chair and as he talked he pulled it out
and began to arrange it behind her still in the most natural and
matteroffact wayso natural and matteroffact indeed that its very
natural matteroffactedness took her breath away

Is that fixed all right he asked

Being a little lady she could only accept his extraordinary
friendliness with grateful appreciation though she could not help
fluttering a little in her bewilderment

Oh thank you thank you Mr Temple Barholm she said

He sat down on the square ottoman facing her and leaned forward with an
air of making a frank confession

Guess what I was thinking to myself two minutes before you came in
I was thinking Lord Im lonesomejust sick lonesome And then I
opened my eyes and lookedand there was a relation Hully gee I call
that luck

Dear me she said shyly delighted DO you Mr Temple
BarholmREALLY

Her formal little way of saying his name was like Anns

Do I Im tickled to death My mother died when I was ten and Ive
never had any women kinfolks

Poor bo She had nearly said Poor boy and only checked the
familiarity just in timePoor Mr Temple Barholm

Say what are we two to each other anyhow He put it to her with
great interest

It is a very distant relationship if it is one at all she answered
You see I was only a second cousin to the late Mr Temple Barholm
and I had not really the SLIGHTEST claim upon him She placed pathetic
emphasis on the fact It was most generous of him to be so kind to me
When my poor father died and I was left quite penniless he gave me aa
sort of home here

A sort of home Tembarom repeated

My father was a clergyman in VERY straitened circumstances We had
barely enough to live uponbarely He could leave me nothing It
actually seemed as if I should have to starveit did indeed There
was a delicate quiver in her voice And though the late Mr Temple
Barholm had a great antipathy to ladies he was soso noble as to send
word to me that there were a hundred and fifty rooms in his house and
that if I would keep out of his way I might live in one of them

That was noble commented her distant relative

Oh yes indeed especially when one considers how he disliked the
opposite sex and what a recluse he was He could not endure ladies I
scarcely ever saw him My room was in quite a remote wing of the house
and I never went out if I knew he was in the park I was most careful
And when he died of course I knew I must go away

Tembarom was watching her almost tenderly

Where did you go

To a kind clergyman in Shropshire who thought he might help me

How was he going to do it

She answered with an effort to steady a somewhat lowered and hesitating
voice

There was near his parish a very nicecharityher breath caught
itself patheticallysome most comfortable almshouses for decayed
gentlewomen He thought he might be able to use his influence to get
me into one She paused and smiled but her small wrinkled hands held
each other closely

Tembarom looked away He spoke as though to himself and without knowing
that he was thinking aloud

Almshouses he said Wouldnt that jolt you He turned on her again
with a change to cheerful concern Say that cushion of yours aint
comfortable I m going to get you another one He jumped up and
taking one from a sofa began to arrange it behind her dexterously

But I mustnt trouble you any longer I must go really she said
half rising nervously He put a hand on her shoulder and made her sit
again

Go where he said Just lean back on that cushion Miss Alicia For
the next few minutes this is going to be MY funeral

She was at once startled and uncomprehending What an extraordinary
expression What COULD it mean

Ffuneral she stammered

Suddenly he seemed somehow to have changed He looked as serious as
though he was beginning to think out something all at once What was he
going to say

Thats New York slang he answered It means that I want to explain
myself to you and ask a few questions

Certainly certainly Mr Temple Barholm

He leaned his back against the mantel and went into the matter
practically

First off havent you ANY folks Then answering her puzzled look
added I mean relations

Miss Alicia gently shook her head

No sisters or brothers or uncles or aunts or cousins

She shook her head again

He hesitated a moment putting his hands in his pockets and taking them
out again awkwardly as he looked down at her

Now heres where Im up against it he went on I dont want to be
too fresh or to butt in butdidnt old Temple Barholm leave you ANY
money

Oh no she exclaimed Dear me no I couldnt possibly EXPECT such a
thing

He gazed at her as though considering the situation Couldnt you he
said

There was an odd reflection in his eyes and he seemed to consider her
and the situation again

Well he began after his pause what I want to know is what you
expect ME to do

There was no unkindness in his manner in fact quite the contrary
even when he uttered what seemed to Miss Alicia these awful unwarranted
words As though she had forced herself into his presence to make
demands upon his charity They made her tremble and turn pale as she got
up quickly shocked and alarmed

Oh nothing nothing nothing WHATEVER Mr Temple Barholm she
exclaimed her agitation doing its best to hide itself behind a fine
little dignity He saw in an instant that his style of putting it had
been way off that his ignorance had betrayed him that she had
misunderstood him altogether He almost jumped at her

Oh say I didnt mean THAT he cried out For the Lords sake dont
think Im such a Tenderloin tough as to make a break like that Not on
your life

Never since her birth had a male creature looked at Miss Alicia with the
appeal which showed itself in his eyes as he actually put his arm half
around her shoulders like a boy begging a favor from his mother or his
aunt

What I meant was He broke off and began again quite anxiously say
just as a favor will you sit down again and let me tell you what I did
mean

It was that natural warm boyish way which overcame her utterly It
reminded her of the only boy she had ever really known the one male
creature who had allowed her to be fond of him There was moisture in
her eyes as she let him put her back into her chair When he had done
it he sat down on the ottoman again and poured himself forth

You know what kind of a chap I am No you dont either You maynt
know a thing about me and I want to tell you Im so different from
everything youve ever known that I scare you And no wonder Its the
way Ive lived If you knew youd understand what I was thinking of
when I spoke just now Ive been cold Ive been hungry Ive walked
the wet streets on my uppers I know all about GOING WITHOUT And do you
expect that I am going to let aa little thing like yougo away from
here without friends and without money on the chance of getting into an
almshouse that isnt vacant Do you expect that of me Not on your life
That was what I meant

Miss Alicia quivered the palepurple ribbons on her little lace cap
quivered

I havent she said and the fine little dignity was piteous a
SHADOW of a claim upon you It was necessary for her to produce a
pockethandkerchief He took it from her and touched her eyes as softly
as though she were a baby

Claim nothing he said Ive got a claim on YOU Im going to stake
one out right now He got up and gesticulated taking in the big
room and its big furniture Look at all this It fell on me like a
thunderbolt Its nearly knocked the life out of me Im like a lost cat
on Broadway You cant go away and leave me Miss Alicia its your duty
to stay Youve just GOT to stay to take care of me He came over to
her with a wheedling smile I never was taken care of in my life Just
be as noble to me as old Temple Barholm was to you give me a sort of
home

If a little gentlewoman could stare it might be said that Miss Alicia
stared at him She trembled with amazed emotion

Do you mean Despite all he had said she scarcely dared to utter the
words lest after all she might be taking for granted more than it was
credible could be true Can you mean that if I stayed here with you it
would make Temple Barholm seem more like HOME Is it possible youyou
mean THAT

I mean just that very thing

It was too much for her Finely restrained little elderly gentlewoman as
she was she openly broke down under it

It cant be true she ejaculated shakily It isnt possible It is
tootoo beautiful and kind Do forgive me I cant help it She
burst into tears

She knew it was most stupidly wrong She knew gentlemen did not like
tears Her father had told her that men never really forgave women who
cried at them And here when her fate hung in the balance she was not
able to behave herself with feminine decorum

Yet the new Mr Temple Barholm took it in as matteroffact a manner as
he seemed to take everything He stood by her chair and soothed her in
his dear New York voice

Thats all right Miss Alicia he commented You cry as much as you
want to just so that you dont say no Youve been worried and youre
tired Ill tell you theres been two or three times lately when I
should like to have cried myself if Id known how Say he added with a
sudden outburst of imagination I bet anything its about time you had
tea

The suggestion was so entirely within the normal order of things that it
made her feel steadier and she was able to glance at the clock

A cup of tea would be refreshing she said They will bring it in
very soon but before the servants come I must try to express

But before she could express anything further the tea appeared Burrill
and a footman brought it on splendid salvers in massive urn and
teapot with chaste sacrificial flame flickering and wonderful hot
buttered and toasted things and wafers of bread and butter attendant
As they crossed the threshold the sight of Miss Alicias small form
enthroned in their employers chair was one so obviously unanticipated
that Burrill made a step backward and the footman almost lost the
firmness of his hold on the smaller tray Each recovered himself in
time however and not until the tea was arranged upon the table near
the fire was any outward recognition of Miss Alicias presence made
Then Burrill pausing made an announcement entirely without prejudice

I beg pardon sir but Higginss cart has come for Miss Temple
Barholms box he is asking when she wants the trap

She doesnt want it at all answered Tembarom Carry her trunk
upstairs again Shes not going away

The lack of proper knowledge contained in the suggestion that Burrill
should carry trunks upstairs caused Miss Alicia to quail in secret but
she spoke with outward calm

No Burrill she said I am not going away

Very good Miss Burrill replied and with impressive civility he
prepared to leave the room Tembarom glanced at the teathings

Theres only one cup here he said Bring one for me

Burrills expression might perhaps have been said to start slightly

Very good sir he said and made his exit Miss Alicia was fluttering
again

That cup was really for you Mr Temple Barholm she ventured

Well now its for you and Ive let him know it replied Tembarom

Oh PLEASE she said in an outburst of feelingPLEASE let me tell
you how GRATEFULhow grateful I am

But he would not let her

If you do he said Ill tell you how grateful _I_ am and thatll
be worse No thats all fixed up between us It goes We wont say any
more about it

He took the whole situation in that way as though he was assuming no
responsibility which was not the simple inevitable result of their
drifting across each otheras though it was only what any man would
have done even as though she was a sort of delightful unexpected
happening He turned to the tray

Say that looks all right doesnt it he said Now you are here I
like the way it looks I didnt yesterday

Burrill himself brought the extra cup and saucer and plate He wished
to make sure that his senses had not deceived him But there she sat who
through years had existed discreetly in the most unconsidered rooms
in an uninhabited wing knowing better than to presume upon her
privilegesthere she sat with an awed and rapt face gazing up at this
new outbreak into Temple Barholms and him joking and grinning as
though he was as pleased as Punch




CHAPTER XV


To employ the figure of Burrill Tembarom was indeed as pleased as
Punch He was one of the large number of men who apart from all
sentimental relations are made particularly happy by the kindly society
of women who expand with quite unconscious rejoicing when a woman
begins to take care of them in one way or another The unconsciousness
is a touching part of the condition The feminine nearness supplies a
primeval human need The most complete of men as well as the weaklings
feel it It is a survival of days when warm arms held and protected
warm hands served and affectionate voices soothed An accomplished male
servant may perform every domestic service perfectly but the fact that
he cannot be a woman leaves a sense of lack An accustomed feminine
warmth in the surrounding daily atmosphere has caused many a man to
marry his housekeeper or even his cook as circumstances prompted

Tembarom had known no woman well until he had met Little Ann His
feeling for Mrs Bowse herself had verged on affection because he would
have been fond of any woman of decent temper and kindliness especially
if she gave him opportunities to do friendly service Little Ann had
seemed the apotheosis of the feminine the warmly helpful the subtly
supporting the kind She had been to him an amazement and a revelation
She had continually surprised him by revealing new characteristics which
seemed to him nicer things than he had ever known before but which if
he had been aware of it were not really surprising at all They were
only the characteristics of a very nice young feminine creature

The presence of Miss Alicia with the longbelated fashion of her
ringlets and her little cap was delightful to him He felt as though
he would like to take her in his arms and hug her He thought perhaps
it was partly because she was a little like Ann and kept repeating his
name in Anns formal little way Her delicate terror of presuming
or intruding he felt in its every shade Mentally she touched him
enormously He wanted to make her feel that she need not be afraid of
him in the least that he liked her that in his opinion she had more
right in the house than he had He was a little frightened lest through
ignorance he should say things the wrong way as he had said that thing
about wanting to know what she expected him to do What he ought to have
said was Youre not expecting me to let that sort of thing go on
It had made him sick when he saw what a break hed made and that she
thought he was sort of insulting her The room seemed all right now that
she was in it Small and unassuming as she was she seemed to make it
less oversized He didnt so much mind the loftiness of the ceiling
the depth and size of the windows and the walls covered with thousands
of books he knew nothing whatever about The innumerable books had been
an oppressing feature If he had been one of those college guys who
never could get enough of books what a cinch the place would have
been for himgood as the Astor Library He hadnt a word to say against
booksgood Lord nobut even if hed had the education and the time
to read he didnt believe he was naturally that kind anyhow You had
to be that kind to know about books He didnt suppose shemeaning
Miss Aliciawas learned enough to make you throw a fit She didnt look
that way and he was mighty glad of it because perhaps she wouldnt
like him much if she was It would worry her when she tried to talk to
him and found out he didnt know a darned thing he ought to

Theyd get on together easier if they could just chin about common sort
of everyday things But though she didnt look like the Vassar sort
he guessed that she was not like himself she had lived in libraries
before and books didnt frighten her Shed been born among people
who read lots of them and maybe could talk about them That was why she
somehow seemed to fit into the room He was aware that timid as she was
and shabby as her neat dress looked she fitted into the whole place as
he did not Shed been a poor relative and had been afraid to death of
old Temple Barholm but shed not been afraid of him because she wasnt
his sort She was a lady that was what was the matter with her It was
what made things harder for her too It was what made her voice tremble
when shed tried to seem so contented and polite when shed talked about
going into one of those decayed almshouses As if the old ladies were
vegetables that had gone wrong by gee he thought

He liked her little modest delicate old face and her curls and her
little cap with the ribbons so much that he smiled with a twinkling eye
every time he looked at her He wanted to suggest something he thought
would be mighty comfortable but he was half afraid he might be asking
her to do something which wasnt her job and it might hurt her
feelings But he ventured to hint at it

Has Burrill got to come back and pour that out he asked with an
awkward gesture toward the teatray Has he just GOT to

Oh no unless you wish it she answered Shallmay I give it to
you

Will you he exclaimed delightedly That would be fine I shall feel
like a regular Clarence

She was going to sit at the table in a straightbacked chair but he
sprang at her

This big one is more comfortable he said and he dragged it forward
and made her sit in it You ought to have a footstool he added and
he got one and put it under her feet There thats all right

A footstool as though she were a royal personage and he were a
gentleman in waiting only probably gentlemen in waiting did not jump
about and look so pleased The cheerful content of his boyish face when
he himself sat down near the table was delightful

Now he said we can ring up for the first act

She filled the teapot and held it for a moment and then set it down as
though her feelings were too much for her

I feel as if I were in a dream she quavered happily I do indeed

But its a nice one aint it he answered I feel as if I was in
two Sitting here in this big room with all these fine things about me
and having afternoon tea with a relation It just about suits me It
didnt feel like this yesterday you bet your life

Does it seemnicer than yesterday she ventured Really Mr Temple
Barholm

Nicer he ejaculated Its got yesterday beaten to a frazzle

It was beyond all belief He was speaking as though the advantage the
relief the happiness were all on his side She longed to enlighten
him

But you cant realize what it is to me she said gratefully to sit
here not terrified and homeless anda beggar any more with your kind
face before me Do forgive me for saying it You have such a kind young
face Mr Temple Barholm And to have an easychair and cushions
and actually a buffet brought for my feet She suddenly recollected
herself Oh I mustnt let your tea get cold she added taking up the
teapot apologetically Do you take cream and sugar and is it to be
one lump or two

I take everything in sight he replied joyously and two lumps
please

She prepared the cup of tea with as delicate a care as though it had
been a sacramental chalice and when she handed it to him she smiled
wistfully

No one but you ever thought of such a thing as bringing a buffet for
my feetno one except poor little Jem she said and her voice was
wistful as well as her smile

She was obviously unaware that she was introducing an entirely new
acquaintance to him Poor little Jem was supposed to be some one whose
whole history he knew

Jem he repeated carefully transferring a piece of hot buttered
crumpet to his plate

Jem Temple Barholm she answered I say little Jem because I remember
him only as a child I never saw him after he was eleven years old

Who was he he asked The tone of her voice and her manner of
speaking made him feel that he wanted to hear something more

She looked rather startled by his ignorance Have youhave you never
heard of him she inquired

No Is he another distant relation

Her hesitation caused him to neglect his crumpet to look up at her
He saw at once that she wore the air of a sensitive and beautifully
mannered elderly lady who was afraid she had made a mistake and said
something awkward

I am so sorry she apologized Perhaps I ought not to have mentioned
him

Why shouldnt he be mentioned

She was embarrassed She evidently wished she had not spoken but
breeding demanded that she should ignore the awkwardness of the
situation if awkwardness existed

Of courseI hope your tea is quite as you like itof course there is
no real reason Butshall I give you some more cream No You see if
he hadnt died hehe would have inherited Temple Barholm

Now he was interested This was the other chap

Instead of me he asked to make sure She endeavored not to show
embarrassment and told herself it didnt really matterto a thoroughly
nice person But

He was the next of kinbefore you Im so sorry I didnt know you
hadnt heard of him It seemed natural that Mr Palford should have
mentioned him

He did say that there was a young fellow who had died but he didnt
tell me about him I guess I didnt ask There were such a lot of other
things Id like to hear about him You say you knew him

Only when he was a little fellow Never after he grew up Something
happened which displeased my father Im afraid papa was very easily
displeased Mr Temple Barholm disliked him too He would not have him
at Temple Barholm

He hadnt much luck with his folks had he remarked Tembarom

He had no luck with any one I seemed to be the only person who was
fond of him and of course I didnt count

I bet you counted with him said Tembarom

I do think I did Both his parents died quite soon after he was born
and people who ought to have cared for him were rather jealous because
he stood so near to Temple Barholm If Mr Temple Barholm had not been
so eccentric and bitter everything would have been done for him but as
it was he seemed to belong to no one When he came to the vicarage it
used to make me so happy He used to call me Aunt Alicia and he had
such pretty ways She hesitated and looked quite tenderly at the
teapot a sort of shyness in her face I am sure she burst forth I
feel quite sure that you will understand and wont think it indelicate
but I had thought so often that I should like to have a little boyif I
had married she added in hasty tribute to propriety

Tembaroms eyes rested on her in a thoughtfulness openly touched with
affection He put out his hand and patted hers two or three times in
encouraging sympathy

Say he said frankly I just believe every woman thats the real
thingd like to have a little boyor a little girlor a little
something or other Thats why pet cats and dogs have such a cinch of
it And theres men thats the same way Its sort of nature

He had such a high spirit and such pretty ways she said again One
of his pretty ways was remembering to do little things to make one
comfortable like thinking of giving one a cushion or a buffet for ones
feet I noticed it so much because I had never seen boys or men
wait upon women My own dear papa was used to having women wait upon
himbring his slippers you know and give him the best chair He
didnt like Jems ways He said he liked a boy who was a boy and not
an affected nincompoop He wasnt really quite just She paused
regretfully and sighed as she looked back into a past doubtlessly
enriched with many similar memories of dear papa Poor Jem Poor
Jem she breathed softly

Tembarom thought that she must have felt the boys loss very much
almost as much as though she had really been his mother perhaps more
pathetically because she had not been his mother or anybodys mother He
could see what a good little mother she would have made looking after
her children and doing everything on earth to make them happy and
comfortable just the kind of mother Ann would make though she had not
Anns steady wonder of a little head or her shrewd farsightedness Jem
would have been in luck if he had been her son It was a darned pity he
hadnt been If he had perhaps he would not have died young

Yes he answered sympathetically its hard for a young fellow to
die How old was he anyhow I dont know

Not much older than you are now It was seven years ago And if he had
only died poor dear There are things so much worse than death

Worse

Awful disgrace is worse she faltered She was plainly trying to keep
moisture out of her eyes

Did he get into some bad mixup poor fellow If there had been
anything like that no wonder it broke her up to think of him

It surely did break her up She flushed emotionally

The cruel thing was that he didnt really do what he was accused of
she said

He didnt

No but he was a ruined man and he went away to the Klondike because
he could not stay in England And he was killedkilled poor boy And
afterward it was found out that he was innocenttoo late

Gee Tembarom gasped feeling hot and cold Could you beat that for
rotten luck What was he accused of

Miss Alicia leaned forward and spoke in a whisper It was too dreadful
to speak of aloud

Cheating at cardsa gentleman playing with gentlemen You know what
that means

Tembarom grew hotter and colder No wonder she looked that way poor
little thing

Buthe hesitated before he spokebut he wasnt that kind was he
Of course he wasnt

No no But you seeshe hesitated herself hereeverything looked
so much against him He had been rather wild She dropped her voice
even lower in making the admission

Tembarom wondered how much she meant by that

He was so much in debt He knew he was to be rich in the future and he
was poor just in those reckless young days when it seemed unfair And
he had played a great deal and had been very lucky He was so lucky
that sometimes his luck seemed uncanny Men who had played with him were
horrible about it afterward

They would be put in Tembarom Theyd be sore about it and bring
it up

They both forgot their tea Miss Alicia forgot everything as she poured
forth her story in the manner of a woman who had been forced to keep
silent and was glad to put her case into words It was her case To tell
the truth of this forgotten wrong was again to offer justification of
poor handsome Jem whom everybody seemed to have dropped talk of and
even preferred not to hear mentioned

There were such piteously cruel things about it she went on He had
fallen very much in love and he meant to marry and settle down Though
we had not seen each other for years he actually wrote to me and told
me about it His letter made me cry He said I would understand and care
about the thing which seemed to have changed everything and made him a
new man He was so sorry that he had not been better and more careful
He was going to try all over again He was not going to play at all
after this one evening when he was obliged to keep an engagement he had
made months before to give his revenge to a man he had won a great deal
of money from The very night the awful thing happened he had told Lady
Joan before he went into the cardroom that this was to be his last
game

Tembarom had looked deeply interested from the first but at her last
words a new alertness added itself

Did you say Lady Joan he asked Who was Lady Joan

She was the girl he was so much in love with Her name was Lady Joan
Fayre

Was she the daughter of the Countess of Mallowe

Yes Have you heard of her

He recalled Anns reflective consideration of him before she had said
Shell come after you He replied now Some one spoke of her to me
this morning They say shes a beauty and as proud as Lucifer

She was and she is yet I believe Poor Lady Joanas well as poor
Jem

She didnt believe it did she he put in hastily She didnt throw
him down

No one knew what happened between them afterward She was in the
cardroom looking on when the awful thing took place

She stopped as though to go on was almost unbearable She had been so
overwhelmed by the past shame of it that even after the passing of years
the anguish was a living thing Her small hands clung hard together
as they rested on the edge of the table Tembarom waited in thrilled
suspense She spoke in a whisper again

He won a great deal of moneya great deal He had that uncanny luck
again and of course people in the other rooms heard what was going on
and a number drifted in to look on The man he had promised to give his
revenge to almost showed signs of having to make an effort to conceal
his irritation and disappointment Of course as he was a gentleman
he was as cool as possible but just at the most exciting moment the
height of the game Jem made a quick movement andand something fell
out of his sleeve

Something gasped Tembarom fell out of his sleeve

Miss Alicias eyes overflowed as she nodded her beribboned little cap

Ither voice was a sob of woeit was a marked card The man he was
playing against snatched it and held it up And he laughed out loud

Holy cats burst from Tembarom but the remarkable exclamation was
one of genuine horror and he turned pale got up from his seat and
took two or three strides across the room as though he could not sit
still

Yes he laughedquite loudly repeated Miss Alicia as if he had
guessed it all the time Papa heard the whole story from some one who
was present

Tembarom came back to her rather breathless

What in thunder did he doJem he asked

She actually wrung her poor little hands

What could he do There was a dead silence People moved just a little
nearer to the table and stood and stared merely waiting They say it
was awful to see his faceawful He sprang up and stood still and
slowly became as white as if he were dying before their eyes Some one
thought Lady Joan Fayre took a step toward him but no one was quite
sure He never uttered one word but walked out of the room and down the
stairs and out of the house

But didnt he speak to the girl

He didnt even look at her He passed her by as if she were stone

What happened next

He disappeared No one knew where at first and then there was a rumor
that he had gone to the Klondike and had been killed there And a year
lateronly a year Oh if he had only waited in Englanda worthless
villain of a valet he had discharged for stealing met with an accident
and because he thought he was going to die got horribly frightened
and confessed to the clergyman that he had tucked the card in poor Jems
sleeve himself just to pay him off He said he did it on the chance
that it would drop out where some one would see it and a marked card
dropping out of a mans sleeve anywhere would look black enough whether
he was playing or not But poor Jem was in his grave and no one seemed
to care though every one had been interested enough in the scandal
People talked about that for weeks

Tembarom pulled at his collar excitedly

It makes me sort of strangle he said Youve got to stand your own
bad luck but to hear of a chap thats had to lie down and take the
worst that could come to him and know it wasnt hisjust KNOW it And
die before hes cleared That knocks me out

Almost every sentence he uttered had a mystical sound to Miss Alicia
but she knew how he was taking it with what hot young human sympathy
and indignation She loved the way he took it and she loved the feeling
in his next words

And the girlgood Lordthe girl

I never met her and I know very little of her but she has never
married

Im glad of that he said Im darned glad of it How could she Ann
wouldnt he knew Ann would have gone to her grave unmarried But she
would have done things first to clear her mans name Somehow she would
have cleared him if shed had to fight tooth and nail till she was
eighty

They say she has grown very bitter and haughty in her manner Im
afraid Lady Mallowe is a very worldly woman One hears they dont get on
together and that she is bitterly disappointed because her daughter has
not made a good match It appears that she might have made several
but she is so hard and cynical that men are afraid of her I wish I had
known her a littleif she really loved Jem

Tembarom had thrust his hands into his pockets and was standing deep in
thought looking at the huge bank of red coals in the firegrate Miss
Alicia hastily wiped her eyes

Do excuse me she said

Ill excuse you all right he replied still looking into the coals
I guess I shouldnt excuse you as much if you didnt He let her cry in
her gentle way while he stared lost in reflection

And if he hadnt fired that valet chap he would be here with you
nowinstead of me Instead of me he repeated

And Miss Alicia did not know what to say in reply There seemed to be
nothing which with propriety and natural feeling one could say

It makes me feel just fine to know Im not going to have my dinner all
by myself he said to her before she left the library

She had a way of blushing about things he noticed when she was shy
or moved or didnt know exactly what to say Though she must have been
sixty she did it as though she were sixteen And she did it when
he said this and looked as though suddenly she was in some sort of
trouble

You are going to have dinner with me he said seeing that she
hesitateddinner and breakfast and lunch and tea and supper and every
old thing that goes You cant turn me down after me staking out that
claim

Im afraid she said You see I have lived such a secluded life
I scarcely ever left my rooms except to take a walk Im sure you
understand It would not have been necessary even if I could have
afforded it which I really couldntIm afraid I have nothingquite
suitablefor evening wear

You havent he exclaimed gleefully I dont know what is suitable
for evening wear but I havent got it either Pearson told me so with
tears in his eyes It never was necessary for me either Ive got to
get some things to quiet Pearson down but until I do Ive got to eat
my dinner in a tweed cutaway and what Ive caught on to is that its
unsuitable enough to throw a man into jail That little black dress
youve got on and that little cap are just way out of sight theyre so
becoming Come down just like you are

She felt a little as Pearson had felt when confronting his new
employers entire cheerfulness in face of a situation as exotically
hopeless as the tweed cutaway and nothing else by way of resource But
there was something so nice about him something which was almost as
though he was actually a gentleman something which absolutely if one
could go so far stood in the place of his being a gentleman It was
impossible to help liking him more and more at every queer speech he
made Still there were of course things he did not realize and perhaps
one ought in kindness to give him a delicate hint

Im afraid she began quite apologetically Im afraid that the
servants Burrill and the footmen you know will bewill think

Say he took her up lets give Burrill and the footmen the Willies
out and out If they cant stand it they can write home to their
mothers and tell em theyve got to take em away Burrill and the
footmen neednt worry Theyre suitable enough and its none of their
funeral anyhow

He wasnt upset in the least Miss Alicia who as a timid dependent
either upon poor dear papa or Mr Temple Barholm had been secretly
in her sensitive ladylike little way afraid of superior servants
all her life knowing that they realized her utterly insignificant
helplessness and resented giving her attention because she was not able
to show her appreciation of their services in the proper mannerMiss
Alicia saw that it had not occurred to him to endeavor to propitiate
them in the least because somehow it all seemed a joke to him and he
didnt care After the first moment of being startled she regarded him
with a novel feeling almost a kind of admiration Tentatively she dared
to wonder if there was not something even ratherrather ARISTOCRATIC in
his utter indifference

If he had been a duke he would not have regarded the servants point of
view it wouldnt have mattered what they thought Perhaps she
hastily decided he was like this because though he was not a duke
bootblacking in New York notwithstanding he was a Temple Barholm There
were few dukes as old of blood as a Temple Barholm That must be it She
was relieved

Whatsoever lay at the root of his being what he was and as he was he
somehow changed the aspect of things for her and without doing anything
but be himself cleared the atmosphere of her dread of the surprise and
mental reservations of the footmen and Burrill when she came down to
dinner in her highnecked muchcleaned and muchrepaired black silk
and with no more distinguishing change in her toilet than a white lace
cap instead of a black one and with poor dear mammas hair bracelet
with the gold clasp on her wrist and a weepingwillow made of poor
dear papas hair in a brooch at her collar

It was so curious though still nice but he did not offer her his arm
when they were going into the diningroom and he took hold of hers with
his hand and affectionately half led half pushed her along with him as
they went And he himself drew back her chair for her at the end of the
table opposite his own He did not let a footman do it and he stood
behind it talking in his cheerful way all the time and he moved it to
exactly the right place and then actually bent down and looked under
the table

Here he said to the nearest manservant wheres there a footstool
Get one please in that odd simple almost aristocratic way It was
not a rude dictatorial way but a casual way as though he knew the man
was there to do things and he didnt expect any time to be wasted

And it was he himself who arranged the footstool making it comfortable
for her and then he went to his own chair at the head of the table
and sat down smiling at her joyfully across the glass and silver and
flowers

Push that thing in the middle on one side Burrill he said Its too
high I cant see Miss Alicia

Burrill found it difficult to believe the evidence of his hearing

The epergne sir he inquired

Is that what its called an apern Thats a new one on me Yes thats
what I mean Push the apern over

Shall I remove it from the table sir Burrill steeled himself to
exact civility Of what use to behave otherwise There always remained
the liberty to give notice if the worst came to the worst though what
the worst might eventually prove to be it required a lurid imagination
to depict The epergne was a beautiful thing of crystal and gold a
celebrated work of art regarded as an exquisite possession It was
almost remarkable that Mr Temple Barholm had not said Shove it on
one side but Burrill had been spared the poignant indignity of being
required to shove

Yes suppose you do Its a fine enough thing when it isnt in the
way but Ive got to see you while I talk Miss Alicia said Mr Temple
Barholm The episode of the epergneBurrills expression and the
rigidly restrained mouths of Henry and James as the decoration was
removed leaving a painfully blank space of tablecloth until Burrill
silently filled it with flowers in a low bowlthese things temporarily
flurried Miss Alicia somewhat but the pleased smile at the head of the
table calmed even that trying moment

Then what a delightful meal it was to be sure How entertaining and
cheerful and full of interesting conversation Miss Alicia had always
admired what she reverently termed conversation She had read of the
houses of brilliant people where they had it at table at dinner and
supper parties and in drawingrooms The French especially the French
ladies were brilliant conversationalists They held salons in which
the conversation was wonderfulMme de Stael and Mme Roland for
instance and in England Lady Mary Wortley Montague Sydney Smith and
Horace Walpole and surely Miss Fanny Burney and no doubt L E L
whose real name was Miss Letitia Elizabeth Landonwhat conversation
they must have delighted their friends with and how instructive it must
have been even to sit in the most obscure corner and listen

Such gifted persons seemed to have been chosen by Providence to delight
and inspire every one privileged to hear them Such privileges had been
omitted from the scheme of Miss Alicias existence She did not know
she would have felt it sacrilegious to admit it even if the fact had
dawned upon her that dear papa had been a heartlessly arrogant
utterly selfish and tyrannical old blackguard of the most pronounced
type He had been of an absolute morality as far as social laws were
concerned He had written and delivered a denunciatory sermon a week
and had made unbearable by his ministrations the suffering hours and the
last moments of his parishioners during the long years of his pastorate
When Miss Alicia in reading records of the helpful relationship of the
male progenitors of the Brontes Jane Austen Fanny Burney and Mrs
Browning was frequently reminded of him she revealed a perception of
which she was not aware He had combined the virile qualities of all of
them Consequently brilliancy of conversation at table had not been the
attractive habit of the household poor dear papa had confined himself
to scathing criticism of the incompetence of females who could not teach
their menials to cook a dinner which was not a disgrace to any decent
household When not virulently aspersing the mutton he was expressing
his opinion of muddleheaded weakness which would permit household bills
to mount in a manner which could only bring ruin and disaster upon a
minister of the gospel who throughout a protracted career of usefulness
had sapped his intellectual manhood in the useless effort to support in
silly idleness a family of brainless and maddening fools Miss Alicia
had heard her character her unsuccessful physical appearance her mind
and her pitiful efforts at tabletalk described in detail with a choice
of adjective and adverb which had broken into terrified fragments every
atom of courage and will with which she had been sparsely dowered

So not having herself been gifted with conversational powers to begin
with and never having enjoyed the exhibition of such powers in others
her ideals had been high She was not sure that Mr Temple Barholms
fluent and cheerful talk could be with exactness termed conversation
It was perhaps not sufficiently lofty and intellectual and did not
confine itself rigorously to one exalted subject But how it did raise
ones spirits and open up curious vistas And how good tempered
and humorous it was even though sometimes the humor was a little
bewildering During the whole dinner there never occurred even one of
those dreadful pauses in which dead silence fell and one tried like a
frightened hen flying from side to side of a coop to think of something
to say which would not sound silly but perhaps might divert attention
from dangerous topics She had often thought it would be so interesting
to hear a Spaniard or a native Hindu talk about himself and his own
country in English Tembarom talked about New York and its people and
atmosphere and he did not know how foreign it all was He described the
streetsFifth Avenue and Broadway and Sixth Avenueand the streetcars
and the elevated railroad and the way fellows had to hustle to put
it over He spoke of a boardinghouse kept by a certain Mrs Bowse and
a presidential campaign and the election of a mayor and a quicklunch
counter and when President Garfield had been assassinated and a
department store and the electric lights and the way he had of making
a sort of picture of everything was really instructive and well
fascinating She felt as though she had been taken about the city in
one of the vehicles the conductor of which described things through a
megaphone

Not that Mr Temple Barholm suggested a megaphone whatsoever that might
be but he merely made you feel as if you had seen things Never had she
been so entertained and enlightened If she had been a beautiful girl
he could not have seemed more as though in amusing her he was also
really pleasing himself He was so very funny sometimes that she could
not help laughing in a way which was almost unladylike because she
could not stop and was obliged to put her handkerchief up to her face
and wipe away actual tears of mirth

Fancy laughing until you cried and the servants looking on

Once Burrill himself was obliged to turn hastily away and twice she
heard him severely reprove an overpowered young footman in a rapid
undertone

Tembarom at least felt that the unlifting heaviness of atmosphere which
had surrounded him while enjoying the companionship of Mr Palford was a
thing of the past

The thrilled interest the surprise and delight of Miss Alicia would
have stimulated a man in a comatose condition it seemed to him The
little thing just loved every bit of itshe just eat it up She asked
question after question sometimes questions which would have made him
shout with laughter if he had not been afraid of hurting her feelings
She knew as little of New York as he knew of Temple Barholm and was it
made him grin to see allured by it as by some illicit fascination She
did not know what to make of it and sometimes she was obliged hastily
to conceal a fear that it was a sort of Sodom and Gomorrah but she
wanted to hear more about it and still more

And she brightened up until she actually did not look frightened and
ate her dinner with an excellent appetite

I really never enjoyed a dinner so much in my life she said when
they went into the drawingroom to have their coffee It was the
conversation which made it so delightful Conversation is such a
stimulating thing

She had almost decided that it was conversation or at least a
wonderful substitute

When she said good night to him and went beaming to bed looking forward
immensely to breakfast next morning he watched her go up the staircase
feeling wonderfully normal and happy

Some of these nights when shes used to me he said as he stuffed
tobacco into his last pipe in the librarysome of these nights Im
darned if I shant catch hold of the sweet little old thing and hug
her in spite of myself I shant be able to help it He lit his pipe
and puffed it even excitedly Lord he said theres some blame fool
going about the world right now that might have married her And hell
never know what a break he made when he didnt




CHAPTER XVI


A fugitive fine day which had strayed into the month from the
approaching spring appeared the next morning and Miss Alicia was
uplifted by the enrapturing suggestion that she should join her new
relative in taking a walk in fact that it should be she who took him
to walk and showed him some of his possessions This it had revealed
itself to him she could do in a special way of her own because during
her life at Temple Barholm she had felt it her duty to try to do a
little good among the villagers She and her longdead mother and
sister had of course been working adjuncts of the vicarage and had
numerous somewhat trying tasks to perform in the way of improving upon
dear papas harrying them into attending church chivying the mothers
into sending their children to Sundayschool and being unsparing in
severity of any conduct which might be construed into implying lack of
appreciation of the vicar or respect for his eloquence

It had been necessary for them as members of the vicars familyalways
of course without adding a sixpence to the household billsto supply
bowls of nourishing broth and arrowroot to invalids and to bestow the
aid and encouragement which result in a man of Gods being regarded with
affection and gratitude by his parishioners Many a mans career in the
church dear papa had frequently observed had been ruined by lack of
intelligence and effort on the part of the female members of his family

No man could achieve proper results he had said if he was hampered
by the selfish influence and foolishness of his womenkind Success in
the church depends in one sense very much upon the conduct of a mans
female relatives

After the deaths of her mother and sister Miss Alicia had toiled on
patiently fading day by day from a slim plain sweetfaced girl to
a slim even plainer and sweeterfaced middleaged and at last elderly
woman She had by that time read aloud by bedsides a great many chapters
in the Bible had given a good many tracts and bestowed as much
arrowroot barleywater and beeftea as she could possibly
encompass without domestic disaster She had given a large amount of
conscientious if not too intelligent advice and had never failed to
preside over her Sundayschool class or at mothers meetings But
her timid unimpressiveness had not aroused enthusiasm or awakened
comprehension Miss Alicia the cottage women said shes well
meanin but shes not one with a head She reminds me one of them
had summed her up of a hen that lays a egg every day but its too
small for a meal and ud never hatch into anythin

During her stay at Temple Barholm she had tentatively tried to do a
little parish work but she had had nothing to give and she was
always afraid that if Mr Temple Barholm found her out he would be
angry because he would think she was presuming She was aware that the
villagers knew that she was an object of charity herself and a person
who was a lady and yet an object of charity was so to speak poaching
upon their own legitimate preserves The rector and his wife were rather
grand people and condescended to her greatly on the few occasions of
their accidental meetings She was neither smart nor influential enough
to be considered as an asset

It was she who conversed during their walk and while she trotted
by Tembaroms side looking more earlyVictorian than ever in a neat
fringed mantle and a small black bonnet of a fashion long decently
interred by a changing world Tembarom had never seen anything
resembling it in New York but he liked it and her increasingly at every
moment

It was he who made her converse He led her on by asking her questions
and being greatly interested in every response she made In fact though
he was quite unaware of the situation she was creating for him such an
atmosphere as he might have found in a book if he had had the habit of
books Everything she told him was new and quaint and very often rather
touching She related anecdotes about herself and her poor little past
without knowing she was doing it Before they had talked an hour he had
an astonishing clear idea of poor dear papa and dearest Emily and
poor darling mama and existence at Rowcroft Vicarage He caught
on to the fact that though she was very much given to the word
dearpeople were dear and so were things and placesshe never
even by chance slipped into saying dear Rowcroft which she would
certainly have done if she had ever spent a happy moment in it

As she talked to him he realized that her simple accustomedness to
English village life and all its accompaniments of county surroundings
would teach him anything and everything he might want to know Her
obscurity had been surrounded by stately magnificence with which
she had become familiar without touching the merest outskirts of its
privileges She knew names and customs and families and things to be
cultivated or avoided and though she would be a little startled and
much mystified by his total ignorance of all she had breathed in since
her birth he felt sure that she would not regard him either with
private contempt or with a lessened liking because he was a vandal pure
and simple

And she had such a nice little old polite way of saying things When
in passing a group of children he failed to understand that their hasty
bobbing up and down meant that they were doing obeisance to him as lord
of the manor she spoke with the prettiest apologetic courtesy

Im sure you wont mind touching your hat when they make their little
curtsies or when a villager touches his forehead she said

Good Lord no he said starting Ought I I didnt know they were
doing it at me And he turned round and made a handsome bow and grinned
almost affectionately at the small amazed party first puzzling and
then delighting them because he looked so extraordinarily friendly
A gentleman who laughed at you like that ought to be equal to a
miscellaneous distribution of pennies in the future if not on the spot
They themselves grinned and chuckled and nudged one another with stares
and giggles

I am sorry to say that in a great many places the villagers are not
nearly so respectful as they used to be Miss Alicia explained In
Rowcroft the children were very remiss about curtseying Its quite sad
But Mr Temple Barholm was very strict indeed in the matter of demanding
proper respectfulness He has turned men off their farms for incivility
The villagers of Temple Barholm have much better manners than some even
a few miles away

Must I tip my hat to all of them he asked

If you please It really seems kinder Youyou neednt quite lift it
as you did to the children just now If you just touch the brim lightly
with your hand in a sort of military salutethat is what they are
accustomed to

After they had passed through the village street she paused at the end
of a short lane and looked up at him doubtfully

Would youI wonder if you would like to go into a cottage she said

Go into a cottage he asked What cottage What for

He had not the remotest idea of any reason why he should go into a
cottage inhabited by people who were entire strangers to him and Miss
Alicia felt a trifle awkward at having to explain anything so wholly
natural

You see they are your cottages and the people are your tenants
and

But perhaps they mightnt like it It might make em mad he argued
If their waterpipes had busted and theyd asked me to come and look
at them or anything but they dont know me yet They might think I was
Mr Buttinski

I dont quite she began Buttinski is a foreign name it sounds
Russian or Polish Im afraid I dont quite understand why they should
mistake you for him

Then he laugheda boyish shout of laughter which brought a cottager
to the nearest window to peep over the pots of fuchsias and geraniums
blooming profusely against the diamond panes

Say he apologized dont be mad because I laughed Im laughing
at myself as much as at anything Its a way of saying that they might
think I was butting in too muchpushing in where I wasnt asked See
I said they might think I was Mr Buttinski Its just a bit of fool
slang Youre not mad are you

Oh no she said Dear me no It is very funny of course Im
afraid Im extremely ignorant aboutabout foreign humor It seemed more
delicate to say foreign than merely American But her gentle little
countenance for a few seconds wore a baffled expression and she said
softly to herself Mr Buttinski Buttinto intrude It sounds quite
Polish I think even more Polish than Russian

He was afraid he would yell with glee but he did not Herculean
effort enabled him to restrain his feelings and present to her only an
ordinarysized smile

I shouldnt know one from the other he said but if you say it
sounds more Polish I bet it does

Would you like to go into a cottage she inquired I think it might
be as well They will like the attention

Will they Of course Ill go if you think that What shall I say he
asked somewhat anxiously

If you think the cottage looks clean you might tell them so and ask a
few questions about things And you must be sure to inquire about Susan
Hibblethwaites legs

What ejaculated Tembarom

Susan Hibblethwaites legs she replied in mild explanation Susan is
Mr Hibblethwaites unmarried sister and she has very bad legs It is a
thing one notices continually among village people more especially the
women that they complain of what they call bad legs I never quite
know what they mean whether it is rheumatism or something different
but the trouble is always spoken of as bad legs And they like you to
inquire about them so that they can tell you their symptoms

Why dont they get them cured

I dont know Im sure They take a good deal of medicine when they can
afford it I think they like to take it Theyre very pleased when the
doctor gives them a bottle o summat as they call it Oh I mustnt
forget to tell you that most of them speak rather broad Lancashire

Shall I understand them Tembarom asked anxious again Is it a sort
of Dago talk

It is the English the workingclasses speak in Lancashire Summat
means something Whoam means home But I should think you would be
very clever at understanding things

Im scared stiff said Tembarom not in the least uncourageously but
I want to go into a cottage and hear some of it Which one shall we go
into

There were several whitewashed cottages in the lane each in its own
bit of garden and behind its own hawthorn hedge now bare and wholly
unsuggestive of white blossoms and almond scent to the uninitiated Miss
Alicia hesitated a moment

We will go into this one where the Hibblethwaites live she decided
They are quite clean civil people They have a naughty queer little
crippled boy but I suppose they cant keep him in order because he is
an invalid Hes rather rude Im sorry to say but hes rather sharp
and clever too He seems to lie on his sofa and collect all the gossip
of the village

They went together up the bricked path and Miss Alicia knocked at
the low door with her knuckles A stout applefaced woman opened it
looking a shade nervous

Good morning Mrs Hibblethwaite said Miss Alicia in a kind but
remote manner The new Mr Temple Barholm has been kind enough to come
to see you Its very good of him to come so soon isnt it

It is that Mrs Hibblethwaite answered respectfully looking him
over Wilt tha coom in sir

Tembarom accepted the invitation feeling extremely awkward because Miss
Alicias initiatory comment upon his goodness in showing himself had
rattled him It had made him feel that he must appear condescending
and he had never condescended to any one in the whole course of his
existence He had indeed not even been condescended to He had met
with slanging and bullying indifference and brutality of manner but he
had not met with condescension

I hope youre well Mrs Hibblethwaite he answered You look it

I deceive ma looks a good bit sir she answered Mony a day ma legs
is nigh as bad as Susans

Tha rt jealous o Susans legs barked out a sharp voice from a
corner by the fire

The room had a flagged floor clean with recent scrubbing with
sandstone the whitewashed walls were decorated with pictures cut
from illustrated papers there was a big fireplace and by it was a
hardlooking sofa covered with blueandwhite checked cotton stuff A
boy of about ten was lying on it propped up with a pillow He had a big
head and a keen ferreteyed face and just now was looking round the
end of his sofa at the visitors Howd tha tongue Tummas said his
mother I wunnot howd it Tummas answered Ma tongues th ony thing
about me as works right an Im noan goin to stop it

Hes a young nowt his mother explained but hes a cripple an we
conna do owt wi him

Do not be rude Thomas said Miss Alicia with dignity

Dunnot be rude thysen replied Tummas Im noan o thy lad

Tembarom walked over to the sofa

Say he began with jocular intent youve got a grouch on aint
you

Tummas turned on him eyes which bored An analytical observer or a
painter might have seen that he had a burning curiousness of look a
sort of investigatory fever of expression

I dunnot know what tha means he said Happen thart talkin
Merican

Thats just what it is admitted Tembarom What are you talking

Lancashire said Tummas Theers some sense i that

Tembarom sat down near him The boy turned over against his pillow and
put his chin in the hollow of his palm and stared

Ive wanted to see thee he remarked Ive made mother an Aunt Susan
an feyther tell me every bit theyve heared about thee in the village
Theer was a lot of it Tha coom fro Meriker

Yes Tembarom began vaguely to feel the demand in the burning
curiosity

Gi me that theer book the boy said pointing to a small table heaped
with a miscellaneous jumble of things and standing not far from him
Its a atlas he added as Tembarom gave it to him Yo con find
places in it He turned the leaves until he found a map of the world
Theers Meriker he said pointing to the United States That
theers north and that theers south All th real Merikens comes from
the North wheer New York is

I come from New York said Tembarom

Tha wert born i th workhouse tha run about th streets i rags tha
pretty nigh clemmed to death tha blacked boots tha sold newspapers
tha feyther was a common workinmonand now thas coom into Temple
Barholm an sixty thousand a year

The last parts true all right Tembarom owned but theres some
mistakes in the first part I wasnt born in the workhouse and though
Ive been hungry enough I never starved to deathif thats what
clemmed means

Tummas looked at once disappointed and somewhat incredulous

Thats th road they tell it i th village he argued

Well let them tell it that way if they like it best Thats not going
to worry me Tembarom replied uncombatively

Tummass eyes bored deeper into him

Does na tha care he demanded

What should I care for Let every fellow enjoy himself his own way

Thart not a bit like one o th gentry said Tummas Thart quite a
common chap Thart as common as me for aw tha foine clothes

People are common enough anyhow said Tembarom Theres nothing much
commoner is there Theres millions of em everywherebillions of em
None of us need put on airs

Thart as common as me said Tummas reflectively An yet tha
owns Temple Barholm an aw that brass I conna mak out how th loike
happens

Neither can I but it does all samee

It does na happen i Meriker exulted Tummas Everybodys equal
theer

Rats ejaculated Tembarom What about multimillionaires

He forgot that the age of Tummas was ten It was impossible not to
forget it He was in fact ten hundred if those of his generation had
been aware of the truth But there he sat having spent only a decade
of his most recent incarnation in a whitewashed cottage deprived of the
use of his legs

Miss Alicia seeing that Tembarom was interested in the boy entered
into domestic conversation with Mrs Hibblethwaite at the other side
of the room Mrs Hibblethwaite was soon explaining the uncertainty
of Susans temper on washdays when it was necessary to depend on her
legs

Cant you walk at all Tembarom asked Tummas shook his head How
long have you been lame

Ever since I wur born Its summat like rickets Ive been lyin here
aw my days I look on at foak an think em over Ive got to do summat
Thats why I loike th atlas Little Ann Hutchinson gave it to me onct
when she come to see her grandmother

Tembarom sat upright

Do you know her he exclaimed

I know her best o onybody in th world An I loike her best

So do I rashly admitted Tembarom

Tha does Tummas asked suspiciously Does she loike thee

She says she does He tried to say it with proper modesty

Well if she says she does she does An if she does then yo an
mell be friends He stopped a moment and seemed to be taking Tembarom
in with thoroughness I could get a lot out o thee he said after the
inspection

A lot of what Tembarom felt as though he would really like to hear

A lot o things I want to know about I wish Id lived th life thas
lived clemmin or no clemmin Thas seen things goin on every day o
thy loife

Well yes theres been plenty going on plenty Tembarom admitted

Ive been lying here for ten year said Tummas savagely An Ive
had nowt i th world to do an nowt to think on but what I could mak
foak tell me about th village But nowt happens but this chap gettin
drunk an that chap deein or losin his place or wenches gettin
married or havin childer I know everything that happens but its nowt
but a lot o women clackin If Id not been a cripple Id ha been
at work for mony a year by now arnin money to save by an go to
Meriker

You seem to be sort of stuck on America Hows that

What dost mean

I mean you seem to like it

I dunnot loike it nor yet not loike it but Ive heard a bit more about
it than I have about th other places on th map Foak goes there to
seek their fortune an it seems loike theres a good bit doin

Do you like to read newspapers said Tembarom inspired to his query
by a recollection of the vision of things doin in the Sunday Earth

Wheerd I get papers from the boy asked testily Foak like us hasnt
got th brass for em

Ill bring you some New York papers promised Tembarom grinning a
little in anticipation And well talk about the news thats in them
The Sunday Earth is full of pictures I used to work on that paper
myself

Tha did Tummas cried excitedly Did tha help to print it or was it
th one tha sold i th streets

I wrote some of the stuff in it

Wrote some of th stuff in it Wrote it thaself How could tha a
common chap like thee he asked more excited still his ferret eyes
snapping

I dont know how I did it Tembarom answered with increased cheer and
interest in the situation It wasnt highbrow sort of work

Tummas leaned forward in his incredulous eagerness

Does tha mean that they paid thee for writin itpaid thee

I guess they wouldnt have done it if theyd been Lancashire Tembarom
answered But they hadnt much more sense than I had They paid me
twentyfive dollars a weekthats five pounds

I dunnot believe thee said Tummas and leaned back on his pillow
short of breath

I didnt believe it myself till Id paid my board two weeks and bought
a suit of clothes with it was Tembaroms answer and he chuckled as he
made it

But Tummas did believe it This after he had recovered from the shock
became evident The curiosity in his face intensified itself his
eagerness was even vaguely tinged with something remotely resembling
respect It was not however respect for the money which had been
earned but for the store of things doin which must have been
required It was impossible that this chap knew things undreamed of

Has tha ever been to th Klondike he asked after a long pause

No Ive never been out of New York

Tummas seemed fretted and depressed

Eh Im sorry for that I wished thad been to th Klondike I want to
be towd about it he sighed He pulled the atlas toward him and found a
place in it

That theers Dawson he announced Tembarom saw that the region of
the Klondike had been much studied It was even rather faded with the
frequent passage of searching fingers as though it had been pored over
with special curiosity

Theres gowdmoines theer revealed Tummas An theers welly newt
else but snow an ice A young chap as set out fro here to get theer
froze to death on th way

How did you get to hear about it

Ann she browt me a paper onet He dug under his pillow and brought
out a piece of newspaper worn and frayed and cut with age and usage
This heers whats left of it Tembarom saw that it was a fragment
from an old American sheet and that a column was headed The Rush for
the Klondike

Why didna tha go theer demanded Tummas He looked up from his
fragment and asked his question with a sudden reflectiveness as though
a new and interesting aspect of things had presented itself to him

I had too much to do in New York said Tembarom Theres always
something doing in New York you know

Tummas silently regarded him a moment or so

Its a pity tha didnt go he said Happen thad never ha coom
back

Tembarom laughed the outright laugh

Thank you he answered

Tummas was still thinking the matter over and was not disturbed

I was na thinkin o thee he said in an impersonal tone I was
thinkin o t other chap If thad gon istead o him hed ha been
here istead o thee Eh but its funny And he drew a deep breath
like a sigh having its birth in profundity of baffled thought

Both he and his evident point of view were funny in the Lancashire
sense which does not imply humor but strangeness and the
unexplainable Singular as the phrasing was Tembarom knew what he
meant and that he was thinking of the oddity of chance Tummas had
obviously heard of poor Jem and had felt an interest in him

Youre talking about Jem Temple Barholm I guess he said Perhaps the
interest he himself had felt in the tragic story gave his voice a tone
somewhat responsive to Tummass own mood for Tummas after one more
boring glance let himself go His interest in this special subject
was it revealed itself a sort of obsession The history of Jem Temple
Barholm had been the one drama of his short life

Aye I was thinkin o him he said I should na ha cared for th
Klondike so much but for him

But he went away from England when you were a baby

Th last toime he coom to Temple Barholm wur when I wur just born Foak
said he coom to ax owd Temple Barholm if hed help him to pay his debts
an th owd chap awmost kicked him out o doors Mother had just had me
an she was weak an poorly an sittin at th door wi me in her arms
an he passed by an saw her He stopped an axed her how she was doin
An when he was goin away he gave her a gold sovereign an he says
Put it in th savinsbank for him an keep it theer till hes a big
lad an wants it Its been in th savinsbank ever sin Ive got
a whole pound o ma own out at interest Theres not many lads ha got
that

He must have been a goodnatured fellow commented Tembarom It was
darned bad luck him going to the Klondike

It was good luck for thee said Tummas with resentment

Was it was Tembaroms unbiased reply Well I guess it was one way
or the other Im not kicking anyhow

Tummas naturally did not know half he meant He went on talking about
Jem Temple Barholm and as he talked his cheeks flushed and his eyes
lighted

I would na spend that sovereign if I was starvin Im going to leave
it to Ann Hutchinson in ma will when I dee Ive axed questions about
him reet and left ever sin I can remember but theers nobody knows
much Mother says he was fine an handsome an gentry through an
through If hed coom into th property hed ha coom to see me
again Ill lay a shillin because Im a cripple an I canna spend his
sovereign If hed coom back from th Klondike happen hed ha towd me
about it He pulled the atlas toward him and laid his thin finger
on the rubbed spot He mun ha been killed somewheer about here he
sighed Somewheer here Eh its funny

Tembarom watched him There was something that rather gave you the
Willies in the way this little cripple seemed to have taken to the
dead man and worried along all these years thinking him over and asking
questions and studying up the Klondike because he was killed there It
was because hed made a kind of story of it Hed enjoyed it in the way
people enjoy stories in a newspaper You always had to give em a kind
of story you had to make a story even if you were telling about a
milkwagon running away In newspaper offices you heard that was the
secret of making good with what you wrote Dish it up as if it was a
sort of story

He not infrequently arrived at astute enough conclusions concerning
things He had arrived at one now Shut out even from the tame drama
of village life Tummas born with an abnormal desire for action and a
feverish curiosity had hungered and thirsted for the story in any
form whatsoever He caught at fragments of happenings and colored and
dissected them for the satisfying of unfed cravings The vanished man
had been the one touch of pictorial form and color in his ten years of
existence Young and handsome and of the gentry unfavored by the owner
of the wealth which some day would be his own possession stopping
gentryway at a cottage door to speak goodnaturedly to a pale young
mother handing over the magnificence of a whole sovereign to be saved
for a newborn child going away to vaguely understood disgrace leaving
his own country to hide himself in distant lands meeting death amid
snow and ice and surrounded by goldmines leaving his empty place to be
filled by a bootblack newsboytrue there was enough to lie and think
over and to try to follow with the help of maps and excited questions

I wish I could ha seen him said Tummas Id awmost gi my sovereign
to get a look at that picture in th gallery at Temple Barholm

What picture Tembarom asked Is there a picture of him there

There is na one o him but theres one o a lad as deed two hundred
year ago as they say wur th spit an image on him when he wur a lad
hissen One o th owd servants towd mother it wur theer

This was a natural stimulus to interest and curiosity

Which one is it Jinks Id like to see it myself Do you know which
one it is Theres hundreds of them

No I dunnot know was Tummass dispirited answer an neither does
mother Th woman as knew left when owd Temple Barholm deed

Tummas broke in Mrs Hibblethwaite from the other end of the room
to which she had returned after taking Miss Alicia out to complain about
the copper in the washus Tummas thast been talkin like a
magpie Thart a lot too bold an ready wi tha tongue Th gentrys
noan comin to see thee if tha clacks th heads off theer showthers

Im afraid he always does talk more than is good for him said Miss
Alicia He looks quite feverish

He has been talking to me about Jem Temple Barholm explained
Tembarom Weve had a regular chin together He thinks a heap of poor
Jem

Miss Alicia looked startled and Mrs Hibblethwaite was plainly
flustered tremendously She quite lost her temper

Eh she exclaimed tha wants tha young yed knocked off Tummas
Hibblethwaite Hes fair daft about th young gentleman asas was
killed He axes questions mony a day till Id give him th stick if he
wasna a cripple He moithers me to death

Ill bring you some of those New York papers to look at Tembarom said
to the boy as he went away

He walked back through the village to Temple Barholm holding Miss
Alicias elbow in light affectionate guidance and support a little to
her embarrassment and also a little to her delight Until he had taken
her into the diningroom the night before she had never seen such a
thing done There was no overfamiliarity in the action It merely
seemed somehow to suggest liking and a wish to take care of her

That little fellow in the village he said after a silence in which it
occurred to her that he seemed thoughtful what a little freak he is
Hes got an idea that theres a picture in the gallery thats said to
look like Jem Temple Barholm when he was a boy Have you ever heard
anything about it He says a servant told his mother it was there

Yes there is one Miss Alicia answered I sometimes go and look at
it But it makes me feel very sad It is the handsome boy who was a page
in the court of Charles II He died in his teens His name was Miles
Hugo Charles James Jem could see the likeness himself Sometimes for a
little joke I used to call him Miles Hugo

I believe I remember him said Tembarom I believe I asked Palford
his name I must go and have a look at him again He hadnt much better
luck than the fellow that looked like him dying as young as that




CHAPTER XVII


Form color drama and divers other advantages are necessary to the
creation of an object of interest Presenting to the world none of these
assets Miss Alicia had slipped through life a scarcely remarked unit
No little ghost of prettiness had attracted the wandering eye no
suggestion of agreeable or disagreeable power of selfassertion had
arrested attention There had been no hour in her life when she had
expected to count as being of the slightest consequence When she had
knocked at the door of the study at Rowcroft Vicarage and dear papa
had exclaimed irritably Who is that Who is that she had always
replied It is only Alicia

This being the case her gradual awakening to the singularity of her new
situation was mentally a process full of doubts and sometimes of alarmed
bewilderments If in her girlhood a curate even a curate with prominent
eyes and a receding chin had proposed to her that she should face with
him a future enriched by the prospect of being called upon to bring up
a probable family of twelve on one hundred and fifty pounds a year with
both parish and rectory barking and snapping at her worndown heels she
would have been sure to assert tenderly that she was afraid she was not
worthy This was the natural habit of her mind and in the weeks which
followed the foggy afternoon when Tembarom staked out his claim she
dwelt often upon her unworthiness of the benefits bestowed upon her

First the world belowstairs then the village and then the county
itself awoke to the fact that the new Temple Temple Barholm had taken
her up The first tendency of the world belowstairs was to resent the
unwarranted uplifting of a person whom there had been a certain luxury
in regarding with disdain and treating with scarcely veiled lack of
consideration To be able to do this with a person who after all was
said and done was not one of the servant class but a sort of lady of
birth was not unstimulating And belowstairs the sense of personal
rancor against a angeron is strong The meals served in Miss
Alicias remote sittingroom had been served at leisure her tea had
rarely been hot and her modestly tinkled bell irregularly answered
Often her far from liberally supplied fire had gone out on chilly days
and she had been afraid to insist on its being relighted Her sole
defense against inattention would have been to complain to Mr Temple
Barholm and when on one occasion a too obvious neglect had obliged her
to gather her quaking being together in mere selfrespect and say If
this continues to occur William I shall be obliged to speak to Mr
Temple Barholm William had so looked at her and so ill hid a secret
smile that it had been almost tantamount to his saying Id jolly well
like to see you

And now Sitting at the end of the table opposite him if you please
Walking here and walking there with him Sitting in the library or
wherever he was with him talking and laughing and making as much of her
as though she were an aunt with a fortune to leave and with her making
as free in talk as though at liberty to say anything that came into her
head Well the beggar that had found himself on horseback was setting
another one galloping alongside of him In the midst of this natural
resentment it was a bit upsetting as Burrill said to find it dawning
upon one that absolute exactness of ceremony was as much to be required
for her as for him Miss Alicia had long felt secretly sure that
she was spoken of as her in the servants hall That businesslike
sharpness which Palford had observed in his client aided Tembarom always
to see things without illusions He knew that There was no particular
reason why his army of servants should regard him for the present as
much more than an intruder but he also knew that if men and women had
employment which was not made hard for them and were well paid for
doing they were not anxious to lose it and the man who paid their
wages might give orders with some certainty of finding them obeyed He
was sharp in more ways than one He observed shades he might have been
expected to overlook He observed a certain shade in the demeanor of the
domestics when attending Miss Alicia and it was a shade which marked
a difference between service done for her and service done for himself
This was only at the outset of course when the secret resentment was
felt but he observed it mere shade though it was

He walked out into the hall after Burrill one morning Not having yet
adjusted himself to the rule that when one wished to speak to a man one
rang a bell and called him back fifty times if necessary he walked
after Burrill and stopped him

This is a pretty good place for servants aint it he said

Yes sir

Good pay good food not too much to do

Certainly sir Burrill replied somewhat disturbed by a casualness
which yet suggested a method of getting at something or other

You and the rest of them dont want to change do you

No sir There is no complaint whatever as far as I have heard

Thats all right Mr Temple Barholm had put his hands into his
pockets and stood looking noncommittal in a steady sort of way
Theres something I want the lot of you to get on toright away Miss
Temple Barholm is going to stay here Shes got to have everything just
as she wants it Shes got to be pleased Shes the lady of the house
See

I hope sir Burrill said with professional dignity that Miss Temple
Barholm has not had reason to express any dissatisfaction

Im the one that would express itquick said Tembarom She wouldnt
have time to get in first I just wanted to make sure I shouldnt have
to do it The other fellows are under you Youve got a head on your
shoulders I guess Its up to you to put em on to it Thats all

Thank you sir said Burrill

His master went back into the library smiling genially and Burrill
stood still a moment or so gazing at the door he closed behind him

Be sure the village and finally circles not made up of cottagers heard
of this howsoever mysteriously Miss Alicia was not aware that the
incident had occurred She could not help observing however that the
manners of the servants of the household curiously improved also when
she passed through the village that foreheads were touched without
omission and the curtseys of playing children were prompt When she
dropped into a cottage housewives polished off the seats of chairs
vigorously before offering them and symptoms and needs were explained
with a respectful fluency which at times almost suggested that she might
be relied on to use influence

Im afraid I have done the village people injustice she said
leniently to Tembarom I used to think them so disrespectful and
unappreciative I dare say it was because I was so troubled myself Im
afraid ones own troubles do sometimes make one unfair

Well yours are over said Tembarom And so are mine as long as you
stay by me

Never had Miss Alicia been to London She had remained as was
demanded of her by her duty to dear papa at Rowcroft which was in
Somersetshire She had only dreamed of London and had had fiftyfive
years of dreaming She had read of great functions and seen pictures
of some of them in the illustrated papers She had loyally endeavored
to follow at a distance the doings of her Majestyshe always spoke
of Queen Victoria reverentially as her Majestyshe rejoiced when
a prince or a princess was born or christened or married and believed
that a drawingroom was the most aweinspiring brilliant and
important function in the civilized world scarcely second to
Parliament Londonno one but herself or an elderly gentlewoman of her
type could have told any one the nature of her thoughts of London

Let therefore those of vivid imagination make an effort to depict
to themselves the effect produced upon her mind by Tembaroms casually
suggesting at breakfast one morning that he thought it might be rather
a good stunt for them to run up to London By mere good fortune she
escaped dropping the egg she had just taken from the eggstand

London she said Oh

Pearson thinks it would be a firstrate idea he explained I guess
he thinks that if he can get me into the swell clothing stores he can
fix me up as I ought to be fixed if Im not going to disgrace him I
should hate to disgrace Pearson Then he can see his girl too and I
want him to see his girl

IsPearsonengaged she asked but the thought which was repeating
itself aloud to her was London London

He calls it keeping company or walking out Tembarom answered
Shes a nice girl and hes dead stuck on her Will you go with me
Miss Alicia

Dear Mr Temple Barholm she fluttered to visit London would be a
privilege I never dreamed it would be my great fortune to enjoynever

Good business he ejaculated delightedly Thats luck for me It gave
me the blueswhat I saw of it But if you are with me Ill bet itll
be as different as afternoon tea was after I got hold of you When shall
we start Tomorrow

Her sixteenyearold blush repeated itself

I feel so sorry It seems almost undignified to mention it butI
fear I should not look smart enough for London My wardrobe is so very
limited I mustnt she added with a sweet effort at humor do the new
Mr Temple Barholm discredit by looking unfashionable

He was more delighted than before

Say he broke out Ill tell you what well do well go together and
buy everything suitable in sight The pair of usll come back here as
suitable as Burrill and Pearson Well paint the town red

He actually meant it He was like a boy with a new game His sense of
the dreariness of London had disappeared He knew what it would be like
with Miss Alicia as a companion He had really seen nothing of the place
himself and he would find out every darned thing worth looking at and
take her to see ittheaters shops every show in town When they left
the breakfasttable it was agreed upon that they would make the journey
the following day

He did not openly refer to the fact that among the plans for their round
of festivities he had laid out for himself the attending to one or
two practical points He was going to see Palford and he had made an
appointment with a celebrated nerve specialist He did not discuss this
for several reasons One of them was that his summing up of Miss Alicia
was that she had had trouble enough to think over all her little life
and the thing for a fellow to do for her if he liked her was to
give her a good time and make her feel as if she was at a picnic right
straight alongnot let her even hear of a darned thing that might worry
her He had said comparatively little to her about Strangeways His
first mention of his condition had obviously made her somewhat nervous
though she had been full of kindly interest She was in private not
sorry that it was felt better that she should not disturb the patient
by a visit to his room The abnormality of his condition seemed just
slightly alarming to her

But oh how good how charitable you are she had murmured

Good he answered the devout admiration of her tone rather puzzling
him It aint that I just want to see the thing through I dropped
into it by accident and then I dropped into this by accident and that
made it as easy as falling off a log I believe hes going to get well
sometime I guess I kind of like him because he holds on to me so and
believes Im just It Maybe its because Im stuck on myself

His visit to Strangeways was longer than usual that afternoon He
explained the situation to him so that he understood it sufficiently not
to seem alarmed by it This was one of the advances Tembarom had noticed
recently that he was less easily terrified and seemed occasionally
to see facts in their proper relation to one another Sometimes the
experiments tried on him were successful sometimes they were not but
he never resented them

You are trying to help me to remember he said once I think you will
sometime

Sure I will said Tembarom Youre better every day

Pearson was to remain in charge of him until toward the end of the
London visit Then he was to run up for a couple of days leaving in his
place a young footman to whom the invalid had become accustomed

The visit to London was to Miss Alicia a period of enraptured delirium
The beautiful hotel in which she was established the afternoons at the
Tower the National Gallery the British Museum the evenings at the
play during which one saw the most brilliant and distinguished actors
the mornings in the shops attended as though one were a person of
fortune what could be said of them And the sacred day on which she
saw her Majesty drive slowly by glittering helmets splendid uniforms
waving plumes and clanking swords accompanying and guarding her and
gentlemen standing still with their hats off and everybody looking
after her with that natural touch of awe which royalty properly
inspires Miss Alicias heart beat rapidly in her breast and she
involuntarily made a curtsey as the great lady in mourning drove by She
lost no shade of any flavor of ecstatic pleasure in anything and was to
Tembarom who knew nothing about shades and flavors indeed a touching
and endearing thing

He had never got so much out of anything If Ann had just been there
well that would have been the limit Ann was on her way to America now
and she wouldnt write to him or let him write to her He had to make a
fair trial of it He could find out only in that way she said It
was not to be denied that the youth and longing in him gave him some
halfhours to face which made him shut himself up in his room and stare
hard at the wall folding his arms tightly as he tilted his chair

There arrived a day when one of the most exalted shops in Bond Street
was invaded by an American young man of a bearing the peculiarities of
which were subtly combined with a remotely suggested air of knowing that
if he could find what he wanted there was no doubt as to his power to
get it What he wanted was not usual and was explained with a frankness
which might have seemed unsophisticated but singularly did not He
wanted to have a private talk with some feminine power in charge and
she must be some one who knew exactly what ladies ought to have

Being shown into a room such a feminine power was brought to him and
placed at his service She was a middleaged person wearing beautifully
fitted garments and having an observant eye and a dignified suavity of
manner She looked the young American over with a swift inclusion of
all possibilities He was by this time wearing extremely wellfitting
garments himself but she was at once aware that his tailored perfection
was a new thing to him

He went to his point without apologetic explanation

You know all the things any kind of a lady ought to have he
saidall the things that would make any one feel comfortable and as if
theyd got plenty Useful things as well as ornamental ones

Yes sir she replied with rising interest I have been in the
establishment thirty years

Good business Tembarom replied Already he felt relieved Ive got
a relation a little old lady and I want her to fix herself out just
as she ought to be fixed Now what Im afraid of is that she wont get
everything she ought to unless I manage it for her somehow beforehand
Shes got into a habit ofwell economizing Now the times past for
that and I want her to get everything a woman like you would know she
really wants so that she could look her best living in a big country
house with a relation that thinks a lot of her

He paused a second or so and then went further fixing a clear and
astonishingly shrewd eye upon the head of the department listening to
him

I found out this was a highclass place he explained I made sure of
that before I came in In a place that was second or third class there
might be people whod think theyd caught a sucker that would take
anything that was unloaded on to him because he didnt know The things
are for Miss Temple Barholm and she DOES know I shall ask her to come
here herself tomorrow morning and I want you to take care of her and
show her the best youve got thats suitable He seemed to like the
word he repeated itSuitable and quickly restrained a sudden
unexplainable wide smile

The attending ladys name was Mrs Mellish Thirty years experience
had taught her many lessons She was a hard woman and a sharp one but
beneath her sharp hardness lay a suppressed sense of the perfect in
taste To have a customer with unchecked resources put into her hands to
do her best by was an inspiring incident A quiver of enlightenment had
crossed her countenance when she had heard the name of Temple Barholm
She had a newspaper knowledge of the odd Temple Barholm story This
was the next of kin who had blacked boots in New York and the obvious
probability that he was a fool if it had taken the form of a hope had
been promptly nipped in the bud The type from which he was furthest
removed was that of the fortuneintoxicated young man who could be
obsequiously flattered into buying anything which cost money enough

Not a things to be unloaded on her that she doesnt like he added
and shes not a girl that goes to pink teas Shes aaladyand not
youngand used to quiet ways

The evidently New York word unload revealed him to his hearer as by a
flash though she had never heard it before

We have exactly the things which will be suitable sir she said I
think I quite understand Tembarom smiled again and thanking her
went away still smiling because he knew Miss Alicia was safe

There were of course difficulties in the way of persuading Miss Alicia
that her duty lay in the direction of spending mornings in the most
sumptuous of Bond Street shops ordering for herself an entire wardrobe
on a basis of unlimited resources Tembarom was called upon to employ
the most adroitly subtle reasoning entirely founded on his claim and
her affectionate willingness to give him pleasure

He really made love to her in the way a joyful young fellow can make
love to his mother or his nicest aunt He made her feel that she counted
for so much in his scheme of enjoyment that to do as he asked would be
to add a glow to it

And they wont spoil you he said The Mellish woman thats the boss
has promised that I wouldnt have you spoiled for a farm he added
heartily

And he spoke the truth If he had been told that he was cherishing her
type as though it were a priceless bit of old Saxe he would have stared
blankly and made a jocular remark But it was exactly this which he
actually clung to and adored He even had a second private interview
with Mrs Mellish and asked her to keep her as much like she was as
was possible

Stimulated by the suppressed touch of artistic fervor Mrs Mellish
guessed at something even before her client arrived but the moment she
entered the showroom all was revealed to her at once The very hint of
flush and tremor in Miss Alicias manner was an assistance Surrounded
by a small and extremely select court composed of Mrs Mellish and two
lowvoiced defthanded assistants it was with a fine little effort
that Miss Alicia restrained herself from exterior suggestion of
her feeling that there was something almost impious in thinking of
possessing the exquisite stuffs and shades displayed to her in flowing
beauty on every side Such linens and batistes and laces such delicate
faint grays and lavenders and softfalling blacks If she had been
capable of approaching the thought such luxury might even have hinted
at guilty splendor

Mrs Mellish became possessed of an idea To create the costume of
an exquisite earlyVictorian old lady in a play done for the most
fashionable and popular actor manager of the most drawingroom of West
End theaters where one saw royalty in the royal box with bouquets on
every side the orchestra breaking off in the middle of a strain to play
God Save the Queen and the audience standing up as the royal party
came inthat was her idea She carried it out steering Miss Alicia
with finished tact through the shoals and rapids of her timidities And
the result was wonderful coloror rather shadestextures and
forms were made subservient by real genius Miss Aliciaas she was
turned out when the wardrobe was completemight have been an elderly
little duchess of sweet and modest good taste in the dress of forty
years earlier It took time but some of the things were prepared as
though by magic and the night the first boxes were delivered at the
hotel Miss Alicia on going to bed in kneeling down to her devotions
prayed fervently that she might not be led astray by fleshly desires
and that her gratitude might be acceptable and not stained by a too
great joy in the things which corrupt

The very next day occurred Rose She was the young person to whom
Pearson was engaged and it appeared that if Miss Alicia would make up
her mind to oblige Mr Temple Barholm by allowing the girl to come to
her as ladysmaid even if only temporarily she would be doing a most
kind and charitable thing She was a very nice wellbehaved girl and
unfortunately she had felt herself forced to leave her place because her
mistresss husband was not at all a nice man He had shown himself so
far from nice that Pearson had been most unhappy and Rose had been
compelled to give notice though she had no other situation in prospect
and her mother was dependent on her This was without doubt not Mr
Temple Barholms exact phrasing of the story but it was what Miss
Alicia gathered and what moved her deeply It was so cruel and so sad
That wicked man That poor girl She had never had a ladysmaid and
might be rather at a loss at first but it was only like Mr Temple
Barholms kind heart to suggest such a way of helping the girl and poor
Pearson

So occurred Rose a pretty creature whose blue eyes suppressed grateful
tears as she took Miss Alicias instructions during their first
interview And Pearson arrived the same night and waiting upon
Tembarom stood before him and with perfect respect choked

Might I thank you if you please sir he began recovering
himselfmight I thank you and say how gratefulRose and me sir
and choked again

I told you it would be all right answered Tembarom It is all right
I wish I was fixed like you are Pearson

When the Countess of Mallowe called Rose had just dressed Miss Alicia
for the afternoon in one of the most perfect of the evolutions of
Mrs Mellishs idea It was a definite creation as even Lady Mallowe
detected the moment her eyes fell upon it Its hue was dull soft gray
and how it managed to concede points and elude suggestions of modes
interred and yet remain what it did remain and accord perfectly with
the side ringlets and the lace cap of Mechlin only dressmaking genius
could have explained The mere wearing of it gave Miss Alicia a support
and courage which she could scarcely believe to be her own When the
cards of Lady Mallowe and Lady Joan Fayre were brought up to her she
was absolutely not really frightened a little nervous for a moment
perhaps but frightened no A few weeks of relief and ease of cheery
consideration of perfectly good treatment and good food and good
clothes had begun a rebuilding of the actual cells of her

Lady Mallowe entered alone She was a handsome person and astonishingly
young when considered as the mother of a daughter of twentyseven She
wore a white veil and looked pink through it She swept into the room
and shook hands with Miss Alicia with delicate warmth

We do not really know each other at all she said It is disgraceful
how little relatives see of one another

The disgrace if measured by the extent of the relationship was not
immense Perhaps this thought flickered across Miss Alicias mind among
a number of other things She had heard dear papa on Lady Mallowe
and howsoever lacking in graces the vicar of Rowcroft had not lacked
an acrid shrewdness Miss Alicias sensitively selfaccusing soul shrank
before a hasty realization of the fact that if he had been present when
the cards were brought up he would on glancing over them through his
spectacles have jerked out immediately What does the woman want
Shes come to get something Miss Alicia wished she had not been so
immediately beset by this mental vision

Lady Mallowe had come for something She had come to be amiable to Miss
Temple Barholm and to establish relations with her

Joan should have been here to meet me she explained Her dressmaker
is keeping her of course She will be so annoyed She wanted very much
to come with me

It was further revealed that she might arrive at any moment which gave
Miss Alicia an opportunity to express with pretty grace the hope that
she would and her trust that she was quite well

She is always well Lady Mallowe returned And she is of course
as interested as we all are in this romantic thing It is perfectly
delicious like a threevolumed novel

It is romantic said Miss Alicia wondering how much her visitor knew
or thought she knew and what circumstances would present themselves to
her as delicious

Of course one has heard only the usual talk one always hears when
everybody is chattering about a thing Lady Mallowe replied with a
propitiating smile No one really knows what is true and what isnt
But it is nice to notice that all the gossip speaks so well of him No
one seems to pretend that he is anything but extremely nice himself
notwithstanding his disadvantages

She kept a fine hazel eye surrounded by a line which artistically
represented itself as black lashes steadily resting on Miss Alicia as
she said the last words

He is said Miss Alicia with gentle firmness nicer than I had ever
imagined any young man could befar nicer

Lady Mallowes glance round the luxurious private sittingroom and
over the perfect idea of Mrs Mellish was so swift as to be almost
imperceptible

How delightful she said He must be unusually agreeable or you
would not have consented to stay and take care of him

I cannot tell you how HAPPY I am to have been asked to stay with him
Lady Mallowe Miss Alicia replied the gentle firmness becoming a soft
dignity

Which of course shows all the more how attractive he must be And in
view of the past lack of advantages what a help you can be to him
It is quite wonderful for him to have a relative at hand who is an
Englishwoman and familiar with things he will feel he must learn

A perhaps singular truth is that but for the unmistakable nature of the
surroundings she quickly took in the significance of and but for the
perfection of the carrying out of Mrs Mellishs delightful idea it
is more than probable that her ladyships manner of approaching Miss
Alicia and certain subjects on which she desired enlightenment would
have been much more direct and much less propitiatory Extraordinary as
it was the creatureshe thought of Tembarom as the creaturehad
plainly been so pleased with the chance of being properly coached that
he had put everything so to speak in the little old womans hands
She had got a hold upon him It was quite likely that to regard her as a
definite factor would only be the part of the merest discretion She was
evidently quite in love with him in her earlyVictorian spinster way
One had to be prudent with women like that who had got hold of a male
creature for the first time in their lives and were almost unaware
of their own power Their very unconsciousness made them a dangerous
influence

With a masterly review of these facts in her mind Lady Mallowe went on
with a fluent and pleasant talk through the medium of which she managed
to convey a large number of things Miss Alicia was far from being clever
enough to realize she was talking about She lightly waved wings of
suggestion across the scene she dropped infinitesimal seeds in passing
she left faint echoes behind herthe kind of echoes one would find
oneself listening to and trying to hear as definitely formed sounds She
had been balancing herself on a precarious platform of rank and title
unsupported by any sordid foundation of a solid nature through a
lifetime spent in London She had learned to catch fiercely at straws of
chance and bitterly to regret the floating past of the slightest which
had made of her a finished product of her kind She talked lightly
and was sometimes almost witty To her hearer she seemed to know every
brilliant personage and to be familiar with every dazzling thing She
knew well what social habits and customs meant what their value
or lack of value was There were customs she implied skilfully
so established by time that it was impossible to ignore them
Relationships for instance stood for so much that was fine in England
that one was sometimes quite touched by the farreachingness of family
loyalty The head of the house of a great estate represented a certain
power in the matter of upholding the dignity of his possessions of
caring for his tenantry of standing for proper hospitality and friendly
family feeling It was quite beautiful as one often saw it Throughout
the talk there were several references to Joan who really must come
in shortly which were very interesting to Miss Alicia Lady Joan
Miss Alicia heard casually was a great beauty Her perfection and her
extreme cleverness had made her perhaps a trifle difficile She had
not doneLady Mallowe put it with a lightness of phrasing which was
delicacy itselfwhat she might have done with every exalted advantage
so many times She had a profound nature Here Lady Mallowe waved away
as it were a ghost of a sigh Since Miss Temple Barholm was a relative
she had no doubt heard of the unfortunate the very sad incident which
her mother sometimes feared prejudiced the girl even yet

You meanpoor Jem broke forth involuntarily from Miss Alicias lips
Lady Mallowe stared a little

Do you call him that she asked Did you know him then

I loved him answered Miss Alicia winking her eyes to keep back the
moisture in them though it was only when he was a little boy

Oh said Lady Mallowe with a sudden singular softness I must tell
Joan that

Lady Joan had not appeared even after they had had tea and her mother
went away but somehow Miss Alicia had reached a vaguely yearning
feeling for her and wished very much the dressmaker had released her
She was quite stirred when it revealed itself almost at the last moment
that in a few weeks both she and Lady Mallowe were to pay a visit at no
great distance from Temple Barholm itself and that her ladyship would
certainly arrange to drive over to continue her delightful acquaintance
and to see the beautiful old place again

In any case one must even if he lived in lonely state pay ones
respects to the head of the house The truth is of course one is
extremely anxious to meet him and it is charming to know that one is
not merely invading the privacy of a bachelor Lady Mallowe put it

Shell come for YOU Little Ann had soberly remarked

Tembarom remembered the look in her quiet unresentful blue eyes when
he came in to dinner and Miss Alicia related to him the events of the
afternoon




CHAPTER XVIII


The spring when they traveled back to the north was so perceptibly
nearer that the fugitive soft days strayed in advance at intervals that
were briefer They chose one for their journey and its clear sunshine
and hints at faint greenness were so exhilarating to Miss Alicia that
she was a companion to make any journey an affair to rank with
holidays and adventures The strange luxury of traveling in a reserved
firstclass carriage of being made timid by no sense of unfitness of
dress or luggage would have filled her with grateful rapture but Rose
journeying with Pearson a few coaches behind appeared at the carriage
window at every important station to say Is there anything I may
do for you maam And there really never was anything she could do
because Mr Temple Barholm remembered everything which could make her
comfort perfect In the moods of one who searches the prospect for
suggestions as to pleasure he can give to himself by delighting a
dear child he had found and bought for her a most elegant little
dressingbag with the neatest of plaingold fittings beautifully
initialed It reposed upon the cushioned seat near her and made her
heart beat every time she caught sight of it anew How wonderful it
would be if poor dear darling mama could look down and see everything
and really know what happiness had been vouchsafed to her unworthy
child

Having a vivid recollection of the journey made with Mr Palford
Tembarom felt that his whole world had changed for him The landscape
had altered its aspect Miss Alicia pointed out bits of freshening
grass was sure of the breaking of brown leafbuds and more than
once breathlessly suspected a primrose in a sheltered hedge corner A
countrybred woman with countrybred keenness of eye and a countrybred
sense of the seasons change she saw so much that he had never known
that she began to make him see also Bare trees would be thickleaved
nestingplaces hedges would be white with hawthorn and hold blue eggs
and chirps and songs Skylarks would spring out of the fields and soar
into the sky dropping crystal chains of joyous trills The cottage
gardens would be full of flowers there would be poppies gleaming
scarlet in the corn and in buttercuptime all the green grass would be
a sheet of shining gold

When it all happens I shall be like a little EastSider taken for a
day in the country I shall be asking questions at every step Tembarom
said Temple Barholm must be pretty fine then

It is so lovely said Miss Alicia turning to him almost solemnly
that sometimes it makes one really lose ones breath

He looked out of the window with sudden wistfulness

I wish Ann he began and then seeing the repressed question in her
eyes made up his mind

He told her about Little Ann He did not use very many words but
she knew a great deal when he had finished And her spinster soul was
thrilled Neither she nor poor Emily had ever had an admirer and it was
not considered refined for unsought females to discuss such subjects
Domestic delirium over the joy of an engagement in families in which
daughters were a drug she had seen It was indeed inevitable that there
should be more rejoicing over one Miss Timson who had strayed from the
fold into the haven of marriage than over the ninetynine Misses Timson
who remained behind But she had never known intimately any one who was
in lovereally in love Mr Temple Barholm must be When he spoke of
Little Ann he flushed shyly and his eyes looked so touching and nice
His voice sounded different and though of course his odd New York
expressions were always rather puzzling she felt as though she saw
things she had had no previous knowledge ofthings which thrilled her

She must be a veryvery nice girl she ventured at length I am
afraid I have never been into old Mrs Hutchinsons cottage She is
quite comfortably off in her way and does not need parish care I wish
I had seen Miss Hutchinson

I wish she had seen you was Tembaroms answer

Miss Alicia reflected

She must be very clever to have suchsensible views she remarked

If he had remained in New York and there had been no question of his
inheriting Temple Barholm the marriage would have been most suitable
But however superior she might be a vision of old Mrs Hutchinsons
granddaughter as the wife of Mr Temple Barholm and of noisy old Mr
Hutchinson as his fatherinlaw was a staggering thing

You think they were sensible asked Tembarom Well she never did
anything that wasnt So I guess they were And what she says GOES I
wanted you to know anyhow I wouldnt like you not to know Im too
fond of you Miss Alicia And he put his hand round her neat glove and
squeezed it The tears of course came into her tender eyes Emotion of
any sort always expressed itself in her in this earlyVictorian manner

This Lady Joan girl he said suddenly not long afterward isnt she
the kind that Im to get used tothe kind in the pictorial magazine
Ann talked about I bought one at the newsstand at the depot before
we started I wanted to get on to the pictures and see what they did to
me

He found the paper among his belongings and regarded it with the
expression of a serious explorer It opened at a page of illustrations
of slim goddesses in court dresses By actual measurement if regarded
according to scale each was about ten feet high but their long lines
combining themselves with court trains waving plumes and falling
veils produced an aweinspiring effect Tembarom gazed at them in
absorbed silence

Is she something like any of these he inquired finally

Miss Alicia looked through her glasses

Far more beautiful I believe she answered These are only
fashionplates and I have heard that she is a most striking girl

A beaut from Beautsville he said So thats what Im up against I
wonder how much use that kind of a girl would have for me

He gave a good deal of attention to the paper before he laid it aside
As she watched him Miss Alicia became gradually aware of the existence
of a certain hint of determined squareness in his boyish jaw It was
perhaps not much more than a hint but it really was there though she
had not noticed it before In fact it usually hid itself behind his
slangy youthfulness and his readiness for any good cheer

One may as well admit that it sustained him during his novitiate and
aided him to pass through it without ignominy or disaster He was
strengthened also by a private resolve to bear himself in such a manner
as would at least do decent credit to Little Ann and her superior
knowledge With the curious eyes of servants villagers and secretly
outraged neighborhood upon him he was shrewd enough to know that he
might easily become a perennial fount of grotesque anecdote to be used
as a legitimate source of entertainment in cottages over the consumption
of beans and bacon as well as at great houses when dinnertable talk
threatened to become dull if not enlivened by some spice He would not
have thought of this or been disturbed by it but for Ann She knew and
he was not going to let her be met on her return from America with what
he called a lot of funny dope about him

No girl would like it he said to himself And the way she said she
cared too much just put it up to me to see that the fellow she cares
for doesnt let himself get laughed at

Though he still continued to be jocular on subjects which to his valet
seemed almost sacred Pearson was relieved to find that his employer
gradually gave himself into his hands in a manner quite amenable In the
touching way in which nine out of ten nice domesticated American males
obey the behests of the women they are fond of he had followed Anns
directions to the letter Guided by the adept Pearson he had gone to
the best places in London and purchased the correct things returning to
Temple Barholm with a wardrobe to which any gentleman might turn at any
moment without a question

Hes got good shoulders though he does slouch a bit Pearson said to
Rose And a gentlemans shoulders are more than half the battle

What Tembarom himself felt cheered by was the certainty that if Ann
saw him walking about the park or the village or driving out with Miss
Alicia in the big landau or taking her in to dinner every evening or
even going to church with her she would not have occasion to flush at
sight of him

The going to church was one of the duties of his position he found
out Miss Alicia put him on to that It seemed that he had to present
himself to the villagers as an example If the Temple Barholm pews
were empty the villagers not being incited to devotional exercise by
his exalted presence would feel at liberty to remain at home and in
the irreligious undress of shirtsleeves sit and smoke their pipes or
worse still gather at the Hare and Hounds and drink beer Also it
would not be at all proper not to go to church

Pearson produced a special cut of costume for this ceremony and
Tembarom walked with Miss Alicia across the park to the squaretowered
Norman church

In a position of dignity the Temple Barholm pews overlooked the
congregation There was the great square pew for the family with two
others for servants Footmen and housemaids gazed reverentially at
prayerbooks Pearson making every preparation respectfully to declare
himself a miserable sinner when the proper moment arrived could
scarcely restrain a rapid side glance as the correctly cut and fitted
and entirely suitable work of his hands opened the pewdoor for Miss
Alicia followed her in and took his place

Let not the fact that he had never been to church before be counted
against him There was nothing very extraordinary in the fact He had
felt no antipathy to churchgoing but he had not by chance fallen under
proselyting influence and it had certainly never occurred to him that
he had any place among the welldressed comfortablelooking people
he had seen flocking into places of worship in New York As far as
religious observances were concerned he was an unadulterated heathen
and was all the more to be congratulated on being a heathen of genial
tendencies

The very large pew under the stone floor of which his ancestors had
slept undisturbedly for centuries interested him greatly A recumbent
marble crusader in armor with feet crossed in the customary manner
fitted into a sort of niche in one side of the wall There were carved
tablets and many inscriptions in Latin wheresoever one glanced The
place was like a room A heavy round table on which lay prayerbooks
Bibles and hymnbooks occupied the middle About it were arranged
beautiful old chairs with hassocks to kneel on Toward a specially
imposing chair with arms Miss Alicia directed him with a glance It was
apparently his place He was going to sit down when he saw Miss Alicia
gently push forward a hassock with her foot and kneel on it covering
her face with her hands as she bent her head He hastily drew forth his
hassock and followed her example

That was it was it It wasnt only a matter of listening to a sermon
you had to do things He had better watch out and see that he didnt
miss anything She didnt know it was his first time and it might worry
her to the limit if he didnt put it over all right One of the things
he had noticed in her was her fear of attracting attention by failing to
do exactly the proper thing If he made a fool of himself by kneeling
down when he ought to stand up or lying down when he ought to sit
shed get hot all over thinking what the villagers or the other people
would say Well Ann hadnt wanted him to look different from other
fellows or to make breaks Hed look out from start to finish He
directed a watchful eye at Miss Alicia through his fingers She remained
kneeling a few moments and then very quietly got up He rose with her
and took his big chair when she sat down He breathed more freely when
they had got that far That was the first round

It was not a large church but a gray and solemn impression of dignity
brooded over it It was dim with light which fell through stainedglass
memorial windows set deep in the thick stone walls The silence
which reigned throughout its spaces seemed to Tembarom of a new kind
different from the silence of the big house The occasional subdued
rustle of turned prayerbook leaves seemed to accentuate it the
most careful movement could not conceal itself a slight cough was
a startling thing The way Tembarom thought they could get things
deadstill in English places

The chimes which had been ringing their last summons to the tardy
slackened their final warning notes became still slower stopped
There was a slight stir in the benches occupied by the infant school It
suggested that something new was going to happen From some unseen place
came the sound of singing voicesboyish voices and the voices of men
Tembarom involuntarily turned his head Out of the unseen place came a
procession in white robes Great Scott every one was standing up He
must stand up too The boys and men in white garments filed into their
seats An elderly man also in white robes separated himself from them
and going into his special place kneeled down Then he rose and began
to read

When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness

Tembarom took the open book which Miss Alicia had very delicately pushed
toward him He read the first wordsthat was plain sailingthen he
seemed to lose his place Miss Alicia turned a leaf He turned one also

Dearly beloved brethren

There you were This was once more plain sailing He could follow it
What was the matter with Miss Alicia She was kneeling again everybody
was kneeling Where was the hassock He went down upon his knees hoping
Miss Alicia had not seen that he wasnt going to kneel at all Then when
the minister said Amen the congregation said it too and he came in
too late so that his voice sounded out alone He must watch that Then
the minister knelt and all the people prayed aloud with him With the
book before him he managed to get in after the first few words but he
was not ready with the responses and in the middle of them everybody
stood up again And then the organ played and every one sang He
couldnt sing anyhow and he knew he couldnt catch on to the kind of
thing they were doing He hoped Miss Alicia wouldnt mind his standing
up and holding his book and doing nothing He could not help seeing that
eyes continually turned toward him Theyd notice every darned break he
made and Miss Alicia would know they did He felt quite hot more than
once He watched Miss Alicia like a hawk he sat down and listened to
reading he stood up and listened to singing he kneeled he tried to
chime in with Amens and to keep up with Miss Alicias bending of head
and knee But the creed with its sudden turn toward the altar caught
him unawares he lost himself wholly in the psalms the collects left
him in deep water hopeless of ever finding his place again and the
litany baffled him when he was beginning to feel safe by changing from
miserable sinners to Spare us Good Lord and We beseech thee to hear
us If he could just have found the place he would have been all
right but an honest anxiety to be right excited him and the fear of
embarrassing Miss Alicia by going wrong made the morning a strenuous
thing He was so relieved to find he might sit still when the sermon
began that he gave the minister an attention which might have marked
him to the chance beholder as a religious enthusiast

By the time the service had come to an end the stately peace of the
place had seemed to sink into his being and become part of himself
The voice of the minister bestowing his blessing the voices of the
whiteclothed choir floating up into the vaulted roof stirred him to a
remote pleasure He liked it or he knew he would like it when he knew
what to do The filing out of the choristers the silent final prayer
the soft rustle of people rising gently from their knees somehow
actually moved him by its suggestion of something before unknown He was
a heathen still but a heathen vaguely stirred

He was very quiet as he walked home across the park with Miss Alicia

How did you enjoy the sermon she asked with much sweetness

I m not used to sermons but it seemed all right to me he answered
What Ive got to get on to is knowing when to stand up and when to sit
down I wasnt much of a winner at it this morning I guess you noticed
that

But his outward bearing had been much more composed than his inward
anxiety had allowed him to believe His hesitations had not produced the
noticeable effect he had feared

Do you mean you are not quite familiar with the service she said
Poor dear boy he had perhaps not been able to go to church regularly at
all

Im not familiar with any service he answered without prejudice I
never went to church before

She slightly started and then smiled

Oh you mean you have never been to the Church of England she said

Then he saw that if he told her the exact truth she would be
frightened and shocked She would not know what to say or what to think
To her unsophisticated mind only murderers and thieves and criminals
NEVER went to church She just didnt know Why should she So he smiled
also

No Ive never been to the Church of England he said




CHAPTER XIX


The country was discreetly conservative in its social attitude The gulf
between it and the new owner of Temple Barholm was too wide and deep to
be crossed without effort combined with immense mental agility It was
on the whole much easier not to begin a thing at all than to begin it
and find one must hastily search about for not too noticeable methods
of ending it A few unimportant tentative calls were made and
several ladies who had remained unaware of Miss Alicia during her first
benefactors time drove over to see what she was like and perhaps by
chance hear something of interest One or two of them who saw Tembarom
went away puzzled and amazed He did not drop his hs which they had
of course expected and he was well dressed and not badlooking but
it was frequently impossible to understand what he was talking about he
used such odd phrases He seemed good natured enough and his way with
little old Miss Temple Barholm was really quite nice queer as it was
It was queer because he was attentive to her in a manner in which
young men were not usually attentive to totally insignificant elderly
dependents

Tembarom derived an extremely diluted pleasure from the visits The few
persons he saw reminded him in varying degrees of Mr Palford They had
not before seen anything like his species and they did not know what
to do with him He also did not know what to do with them A certain
inelasticity frustrated him at the outset When in obedience to Miss
Alicias instructions he had returned the visits he felt he had not
gone far

Serious application enabled him to find his way through the church
service and he accompanied Miss Alicia to church with great regularity
He began to take down the books from the library shelves and look them
over gravely The days gradually ceased to appear so long but he had
a great deal of time on his hands and he tried to find ways of filling
it He wondered if Ann would be pleased if he learned things out of
books

When he tentatively approached the subject of literature with Miss
Alicia she glowed at the delightful prospect of his reading aloud to
her in the eveningsreading improving things like history and the
poets

Lets take a hack at it some night he said pleasantly

The more a fellow knew the better it was for him he supposed but he
wondered if anything happened and he went back to New York how much
improving things and poetry would help a man in doing business

The first evening they began with Grays Elegy and Miss Alicia felt
that it did not exhilarate him she was also obliged to admit that
he did not read it very well But she felt sure he would improve
Personally she was touchingly happy The sweetly domestic picture of
the situation she sitting by the fire with her knitting and he
reading aloud moved and delighted her The next evening she suggested
Tennysons Maud He was not as much stirred by it as she had hoped He
took a somewhat humorous view of it

He had it pretty bad hadnt he he said of the desperate lover

Oh if only you could once have heard Sims Reeves sing Come into the
Garden Maud she sighed A kind friend once took me to hear him and
I have never never forgotten it

But Mr Temple Barholm notably did not belong to the atmosphere of
impassioned tenors

On still another evening they tried Shakspere Miss Alicia felt that
a foundation of Shakspere would be improving indeed They began with
Hamlet

He found playreading difficult and Shaksperian language baffling but
he made his way with determination until he reached a point where he
suddenly grew quite red and stopped

Say have you read this he inquired after his hesitation

The plays of Shakspere are a part of every young ladys education she
answered but I am afraid I am not at all a Shaksperian scholar

A young ladys education he repeated Gee whizz he added softly
after a pause

He glanced over a page or so hastily and then laid the book down

Say he suggested with an evasive air lets go over that Maud one
again Itswell its easier to read aloud

The crude awkwardness of his manner suddenly made Miss Alicia herself
flush and drop a stitch in her knitting How dreadful of her not to have
thought of that

The Elizabethan age was I fear a rather coarse one in some respects
Even history acknowledges that Queen Elizabeth herself used profane
language She faltered and coughed a little apologetic cough as she
picked up her stitch again

I bet Anns never seen inside Shakspere said Tembarom Before reading
aloud in the future he gave some previous personal attention to the poem
or subject decided upon It may be at once frankly admitted that when he
read aloud it was more for Miss Alicias delectation than for his own
He saw how much she enjoyed the situation

His effect of frankness and constant boyish talk was so inseparable from
her idea of him that she found it a puzzling thing to realize that she
gradually began to feel aware of a certain remote reserve in him
or what might perhaps be better described as a habit of silence upon
certain subjects She felt it marked in the case of Strangeways She
surmised that he saw Strangeways often and spent a good deal of time
with him but he spoke of him rarely and she never knew exactly what
hours were given to him Sometimes she imagined he found him a greater
responsibility than he had expected Several times when she believed
that he had spent part of a morning or afternoon in his room he was
more silent than usual and looked puzzled and thoughtful She observed
as Mr Palford had that the picturegallery with its portraits of his
ancestors had an attraction A certain rainy day he asked her to go
with him and look them over It was inevitable that she should soon
wander to the portrait of Miles Hugo and remain standing before it
Tembarom followed and stood by her side in silence until her sadness
broke its bounds with a pathetic sigh

Was he very like him he asked

She made an unconscious startled movement For the moment she had
forgotten his presence and she had not really expected him to remember

I mean Jem he answered her surprised look How was he like him Was
there he hesitated and looked really interestedwas he like him in
any particular thing

Yes she said turning to the portrait of Miles Hugo again They both
had those handsome drooping eyes with the lashes coming together
at the corners There is something very fascinating about them isnt
there I used to notice it so much in dear little Jem You see how
marked they are in Miles Hugo

Yes Tembarom answered A fellow who looked that way at a girl when
he made love to her would get a strangleholt She wouldnt forget him
soon

It strikes you in that way too said Miss Alicia shyly I used to
wonder if it wasnot quite nice of me to think of it But it did seem
that if any one did look at one like that Maidenly shyness overcame
her Poor Lady Joan she sighed

Theres a sort of cleft in his chin though its a good square chin
he suggested And that smile of hisWere Jems

Yes they were The likeness was quite odd sometimesquite

Those are things that wouldnt be likely to change much when he grew
up Tembarom said drawing a little closer to the picture Poor Jem
He was up against it hard and plenty He had it hardest This chap only
died

There was no mistaking his sympathy He asked so many questions that
they sat down and talked instead of going through the gallery He was
interested in the detail of all that had occurred after the ghastly
moment when Jem had risen from the cardtable and stood looking around
like some baited dying animal at the circle of cruel faces drawing in
about him How soon had he left London Where had he gone first How had
he been killed He had been buried with others beneath a fall of earth
and stones Having heard this much Tembarom saw he could not ask more
questions Miss Alicia became pale and her hands trembled She could
not bear to discuss details so harrowing

Say I oughtnt to let you talk about that he broke out and he
patted her hand and made her get up and finish their walk about the
gallery He held her elbow in his own odd nice way as he guided her
and the things he said and the things he pretended to think or not to
understand were so amusing that in a short time he had made her
laugh She knew him well enough by this time to be aware that he was
intentionally obliging her to forget what it only did her harm to
remember That was his practical way of looking at it

Getting a grouch on or being sorry for what you cant help cuts no
ice he sometimes said When it does me for getting up at daybreak
and keeping at it But it doesnt you bet your life on that

She could see that he had really wanted to hear about Jem but he knew
it was bad for her to recall things and he would not allow her to dwell
on them just as she knew he would not allow himself to dwell on little
Miss Hutchinson remotely placed among the joys of his beloved New York

Two other incidents besides the visit to Miles Hugo afterward marked
that day when Miss Alicia looked back on it The first was his unfolding
to her his plans for the houseparty which was characteristic of his
habit of thinking things over and deciding them before he talked about
them

If Im going to try the thing out as Ann says I must he began when
they had gone back to the library after lunch Ive got to get going
Im not seeing any of those Pictorial girls and I guess Ive got to see
some

You will be invited to dine at places said Miss Aliciapresently
she added bravely in fact with an air of greater conviction than she
felt

If its not the law that theyve got to invite me or go to jail said
Tembarom I dont blame em for not doing it if theyre not stuck on
me And theyre not and its natural But Ive got to get in my fine
work or my yearll be over before Ive found out for myself as Ann
called it Theres where Im at Miss Aliciaand Ive been thinking of
Lady Joan and her mother You said you thought theyd come and stay here
if they were properly asked

I think they would answered Miss Alicia with her usual delicacy
I thought I gathered from Lady Mallowe that as she was to be in the
neighborhood she would like to see you and Temple Barholm which she
greatly admires

If youll tell me what to do Ill get her here to stay awhile he
said and Lady Joan with her Youd have to show me how to write to ask
them but perhaps youd write yourself

They will be at Asshawe Holt next week said Miss Alicia and we
could go and call on them together We might write to them in London
before they leave

Well do it answered Tembarom His manner was that of a practical
young man attacking matteroffact detail From what I hear Lady Joan
would satisfy even Ann They say shes the bestlooker on the slate If
I see her every day I shall have seen the blueribbon winner Then if
shes here perhaps others of her sortll come too and theyll have to
see me whether they like it or notand I shall see them Good Lord he
added seriously Id let em swarm all over me and bite me all summer
if it would fix Ann

He stood up with his hands thrust deep in his pockets and looked down
at the floor

I wish she knew T T like T T knows himself he said It was quite
wistful

It was so wistful and so boyish that Miss Alicia was thrilled as he
often thrilled her

She ought to be a very happy girl she exclaimed

Shes going to be he answered sure as youre alive But whatever
she does is right and this is as right as everything else So it just
goes

They wrote their letters at once and sent them off by the afternoon
post The letter Miss Alicia composed and which Tembarom copied he
read and reread with visions of Jim Bowles and Julius looking over his
shoulder If they picked it up on Broadway with his name signed to it
and read it theyd throw a fit over it laughing But he supposed she
knew what you ought to write

It had not indeed the masculine touch When Lady Mallowe read it she
laughed several times She knew quite well that he had not known what
to say and allowing Miss Alicia to instruct him had followed her
instructions to the letter But she did not show the letter to Joan
who was difficult enough to manage without being given such material to
comment upon

The letters had just been sent to the post when a visitor was
announcedCaptain Palliser Tembarom remembered the name and recalled
also certain points connected with him He was the one who was a
promoter of schemesOne of the smooth clever ones that get up
companies Little Ann had said

That in a wellbred and not too pronounced way he looked smooth and
clever might be admitted His effect was that of height finished
slenderness of build and extremely wellcut garments He was no longer
young and he had smooth thin hair and a languidly observant gray eye

I have been staying at Detchworth Grange he explained when he had
shaken hands with the new Temple Barholm and Miss Alicia It gave me an
excellent opportunity to come and pay my respects

There was a hint of uncertainty in the observant gray eye The fact was
that he realized in the space of five minutes that he knew his ground
even less than he had supposed he did He had not spent his week at
Detchworth Grange without making many quiet investigations but he had
found out nothing whatever The new man was an ignoramus but no one had
yet seemed to think him exactly a fool He was not excited by the new
grandeurs of his position and he was not ashamed of himself Captain
Palliser wondered if he was perhaps sharpone of those New Yorkers
shrewd even to lightfingeredness in clever scheming Stories of a newly
created method of business dealing involving an air of candor and
almost primitive good naturean American methodhad attracted Captain
Pallisers attention for some time A certain Yankee rawness of manner
played a part as a factor a crudity which would throw a man off guard
if he did not recognize it The person who employed the method was
of philosophical noncombativeness The New York phrase was that He
jollied a man along Immense schemes had been carried through in that
way Men in London in England were not sufficiently light of touch
in their jocularity He wondered if perhaps this young fellow with his
ready laugh and rather loosejointed casual way of carrying himself
was of this dangerous new school

What however could he scheme for being the owner of Temple Barholms
money It may be mentioned at once that Captain Pallisers past had
been such as had fixed him in the belief that every one was scheming
for something People with money wanted more or were privately arranging
schemes to prevent other schemers from getting any shade the better of
them Debutantes with shy eyes and slim figures had their little plans
to engineer delicately Sometimes they were larger plans than the
uninitiated would have suspected as existing in the brains of creatures
in their teens sometimes they were mere fantastic little ideas
connected with dashing young men or innocent dances which must be
secured or lovely young rivals who must be evaded Young men had also
deft things to dopeople to see or not to see reasons for themselves
being seen or avoiding observation As years increased reasons for
schemes became more numerous and amazingly more varied Women with
daughters with sons with husbands found in each relationship
a necessity for active if quiet manoeuvering Women like Lady
Mallowegood heaven by what schemes did not that woman live and have
her beingand her daughtersfrom day to day Without money without
a friend who was an atom more to be relied on than she would have been
herself if an acquaintance had needed her aid her outwardly welltodo
and fashionable existence was a handtohand fight No wonder she had
turned a still rather brilliant eye upon Sir Moses Monaldini the great
Israelite financier All of these types passed rapidly before his mental
vision as he talked to the American Temple Barholm What could he want
by chance He must want something and it would be discreet to find out
what it chanced to be

If it was social success he would be better off in London where in
these days you could get a good run for your money and could swing
yourself up from one rung of the ladder to another if you paid some
one to show you how He himself could show him how A youngster who
had lived the beastly hard life he had lived would be likely to find
exhilaration in many things not difficult to purchase It was an odd
thing by the way the fancy he had taken to the little earlyVictorian
spinster It was not quite natural It perhaps denoted tendenciesor
lack of tendenciesit would also be well to consider Palliser was
a sufficiently finished product himself to be struck greatly by the
artistic perfection of Miss Alicia and to wonder how much the new man
understood it

He did not talk to him about schemes He talked to him of New York
which he had never seen and hoped sometime shortly to visit The
information he gained was not of the kind he most desired but it
edified him Tembaroms knowledge of high finance was a street lads
knowledge of it and he himself knew its limitations and probable
unreliability Such of his facts as rested upon the foundation of
experience did not include multimillionaires and their resources

Captain Palliser passed lightly to Temple Barholm and its neighborhood
He knew places and names and had been to Detchworth more than once
He had never visited Temple Barholm and his interest suggested that he
would like to walk through the gardens Tembarom took him out and they
strolled about for some time Even an alert observer would not have
suspected the fact that as they strolled Tembarom slouching a trifle
and with his hands in his pockets Captain Palliser bearing himself with
languid distinction each man was summing up the other and considering
seriously how far and in what manner he could be counted as an asset

You havent been to Detchworth yet Palliser inquired

No not yet answered Tembarom The Granthams were of those who had
not yet called

Its an agreeable house The Granthams are agreeable people

Are there any young people in the family Tembarom asked

Young people Male or female Palliser smilingly put it Suddenly it
occurred to him that this might give him a sort of lead

Girls said Tembarom crudelyjust plain girls

Palliser laughed Here it was perhaps

They are not exactly plain girls though they are not beauties
There are four Misses Grantham Lucy is the prettiest Amabel is quite
tremendous at tennis

Are they ladies inquired Tembarom

Captain Palliser turned and involuntarily stared at him What was the
fellow getting at

Im afraid I dont quite understand he said

The new Temple Barholm looked quite serious He did not amazing to
relate look like a fool even when he gave forth his extraordinary
question It was his almost businesslike seriousness which saved him

I mean do you call them Lady Lucy and Lady Amabel he answered

If he had been younger less hardened or less finished Captain
Palliser would have laughed outright But he answered without
selfrevelation

Oh I see You were asking whether the family is a titled one No
it is a good old name quite old in fact but no title goes with the
estate

Who are the titled people about here Tembarom asked quite unabashed

The Earl of Pevensy at Pevensy Park the Duke of Stone at Stone Hover
Lord Hambrough at Doone Doone is in the next county just over the
border

Have they all got daughters

Captain Palliser found it expedient to clear his throat before speaking

Lord Pevensy has daughters so has the duke Lord Hambrough has three
sons

How many daughters are therein a bunch Mr Temple Barholm suggested
liberally

There Captain Palliser felt it safe to allow himself to smile as though
taking it with a sense of humor

In a bunch is an awfully good way of putting it he said It
happens to apply perhaps rather unfortunately well both families are
much poorer than they should be and daughters must be provided for
Each has four In a bunch there are eight Lady Alice Lady Edith
Lady Ethel and Lady Celia at Stone Hover Lady Beatrice Lady Gwynedd
Lady Honora and Lady Gwendolen at Pevensy Park And not a fortune among
them poor girls

Its not the money that matters so much said the astounding
foreigner its the titles

Captain Palliser stopped short in the garden path for a moment He could
scarcely believe his ears The crude grotesqueness of it so far got the
better of him that if he had not coughed he would have betrayed himself

Ive had a confounded cold lately he said Excuse me I must get it
over

He turned a little aside and coughed energetically

After watching him a few seconds Tembarom slipped two fingers into his
waistcoat pocket and produced a small tube of tablets

Take two of these he said as soon as the cough stopped I always
carry it about with me Its a New York thing called G Destroyer G
stands for grippe

Palliser took it

Thanks With water No Just dissolve in the mouth Thanks awfully
And he took two with tears still standing in his eyes

Dont taste bad do they Mr Temple Barholm remarked encouragingly

Not at all I think I shall be all right now I just needed the relief
I have been trying to restrain it

Thats a mistake said Tembarom They strolled on a pace or so and
he began again as though he did not mean to let the subject drop Its
the titles he said and the kind How many of them are goodlookers

Palliser reflected a moment as though making mental choice

Lady Alice and Lady Celia are rather plain he said and both of them
are invalidish Lady Ethel is tall and has handsome eyes but Lady Edith
is really the beauty of the family She rides and dances well and has a
charming color

And the other ones Tembaron suggested as he pausedLady Beatrice
and Lady Gwynedd and Lady Honora and Lady Gwendolen

You remember their names well Palliser remarked with a halflaugh

Oh I shall remember them all right Tembarom answered I earned
twentyfive per in New York by getting names down fine

The Talchesters are really all rather taking Talchester is Lord
Pevensys family name Palliser explained They are girls who have
pretty little noses and bright complexions and eyes Lady Gwynedd and
Lady Honora both have quite fascinating dimples

Dimples exclaimed his companion Good business

Do you like dimples particularly Palliser inquired with an impartial
air

Id always make a beeline for a dimple replied Mr Temple Barholm
Clear the way when I start

This was New York phrasing and was plainly humorous but there was
something more than humor in his eye and smilesomething hinting
distantly at recollection

Youll find them at Pevensy Park said Palliser

What about Lady Joan Fayre was the next inquiry

Pallisers side glance at him was observant indeed He asked himself how
much the man could know Taking the past into consideration Lady Joan
might turn out to be a subject requiring delicate handling It was not
the easiest thing in the world to talk at all freely to a person with
whom one desired to keep on good terms about a young woman supposed
still to cherish a tragic passion for the dead man who ought to stand
at the present moment in the persons figuratively speaking extremely
illfitting shoes

Lady Joan has been from her first season an undeniable beauty he
replied

She and the old lady are going to stay at a place called Asshawe Holt
I think theyre going next week Tembarom said

The old lady repeated Captain Palliser

I mean her mother The one thats the Countess of Mallowe

Have you met Lady Mallowe Palliser inquired with a not wholly
repressed smile A vision of Lady Mallowe overhearing their
conversation arose before him

No I havent Whats she like

She is not the earlyor midVictorian old lady was Pallisers reply
She wears Gainsborough hats and looks a quite possible eight and
thirty She is a handsome person herself

He was not aware that the term old lady was among Americans of the
class of Mrs Bowses boarders a sort of generic term signifying almost
anything maternal which had passed thirty

Tembarom proceeded

After they get through at the Asshawe Holt place Ive asked them to
come here

Indeed said Palliser with an inward start The man evidently did
not know what other people did After all why should he He had been
selling something or other in the streets of New York when the thing
happened and he knew nothing of London

The countess called on Miss Alicia when we were in London he heard
next She said we were relations

You areas we are The connection is rather distant but it is near
enough to form a sort of link

Ive wanted to see Lady Joan explained Tembarom From what Ive
heard I should say she was one of the Ladys Pictorial kind

I am afraid Pallisers voice was slightly unsteady for the
momentI have not studied the type sufficiently to know The
Pictorial is so exclusively a womens periodical

His companion laughed

Well Ive only looked through it once myself just to find out Some
way I always think of Lady Joan as if she was like one of those Beauts
from Beautsville with trains as long as parlorcars and feathers
in their headsdressed to go to see the queen I guess shes been
presented at court he added

Yes she has been presented

Do they let em go more than once he asked with casual curiosity

Confound this cough exclaimed Captain Palliser and he broke forth
again

Take another G said Tembarom producing his tube Say just take the
bottle and keep it in your pocket

When the brief paroxysm was over and they moved on again Palliser was
looking an odd thing or so in the face I always think of Lady Joan
was one of them Always seemed to go rather far How often and why had
he always thought The fellow was incredible Did his sharp boyish
face and his slouch conceal a colossal vulgar young ambition There
was not much concealment about it Heaven knew And as he so evidently
was not aware of the facts how would they affect him when he discovered
them And though Lady Mallowe was a woman not in the least distressed or
hampered by shades of delicacy and scruple she surely was astute
enough to realize that even this bounders dullness might be awakened
to realize that there was more than a touch of obvious indecency in
bringing the girl to the house of the man she had tragically loved and
manoeuvering to work her into it as the wife of the man who monstrously
unfit as he was had taken his place Captain Palliser knew well that
the pressing of the relationship had meant only one thing And how in
the name of the Furies had she dragged Lady Joan into the scheme with
her

It was as unbelievable as was the new Temple Barholm himself And how
unconcerned the fellow looked Perhaps the man he had supplanted was no
more to him than a scarcely remembered name if he was as much as that
Then Tembarom pacing slowly by his side hands in pockets eyes on the
walk spoke

Did you ever see Jem Temple Barholm he asked

It was like a thunderbolt He said it as though he were merely carrying
his previous remarks on to their natural conclusion but Palliser felt
himself so suddenly unadjusted so to speak that he palpably hesitated

Did you his companion repeated

I knew him well was the answer made as soon as readjustment was
possible

Remember just how he looked

Perfectly He was a striking fellow Women always said he had
fascinating eyes

Sort of slant downward on the outside cornersand black eyelashes
sorter sweeping together

Palliser turned with a movement of surprise

How did you know It was just that odd sort of thing

Miss Alicia told me And theres a picture in the gallery thats like
him

Captain Palliser felt as embarrassed as Miss Alicia had felt but it was
for a different reason She had felt awkward because she had feared she
had touched on a delicate subject Palliser was embarrassed because he
was entirely thrown out of all his calculations He felt for the moment
that there was no calculating at all no security in preparing paths
You never know where they would lead Here had he been actually alarmed
in secret And the oaf stood before him undisturbedly opening up the
subject himself

For a fellow like that to lose a girl as he lost Lady Joan was pretty
tough the oaf said By gee it was tough

He knew it allthe whole thing scandal tragically broken marriage
everything And knowing it he was laying his Yankee plans for getting
the girl to Temple Barholm to look her over It was of a grossness
one sometimes heard of in men of his kind and yet it seemed in its
casualness to outleap any little scheme of the sort he had so far
looked on at

Lady Joan felt it immensely he said

A footman was to be seen moving toward them evidently bearing a
message Tea was served in the drawingroom and he had come to announce
the fact

They went back to the house and Miss Alicia filled cups for them and
presided over the splendid tray with a persuasive suggestion in the
matter of hot or cold things which made it easy to lead up to any
subject She was the best of unobtrusive hostesses


Palliser talked of his visit at Detchworth which had been shortened
because he had gone to fit in and remain until a large but uncertain
party turned up It had turned up earlier than had been anticipated and
of course he could only delicately slip away

I am sorry it has happened however he said not only because one
does not wish to leave Detchworth but because I shall miss Lady Mallowe
and Lady Joan who are to be at Asshawe Holt next week I particularly
wanted to see them

Miss Alicia glanced at Tembarom to see what he would do He spoke before
he could catch her glance

Say he suggested why dont you bring your grip over here and stay
I wish you would

A grip means a Gladstone bag Miss Alicia murmured in a rapid
undertone

Palliser replied with appreciative courtesy Things were going extremely
well

Thats awfully kind of you he answered I should like it
tremendously Nothing better You are giving me a delightful
opportunity Thank you thank you If I may turn up on Thursday I shall
be delighted

There was satisfaction in this at least in the observant gray eye when
he went away




CHAPTER XX


Dinner at Detchworth Grange was most amusing that evening One of the
chief reasonsin fact it would not be too venturesome to say THE chief
reasonfor Captain Pallisers frequent presence in very good country
houses was that he had a way of making things amusing His relation of
anecdotes of people and things was distinguished by a manner which
subtly declined to range itself on the side of vulgar gossip Quietly
and with a fine casualness he conveyed the whole picture of the new
order at Temple Barholm He did it with wonderfully light touches and
yet the whole thing was to be seenthe little old maid in her exquisite
clothes her unmistakable stamp of timid good breeding her protecting
adoration combined with bewilderment the long lean not altogether
illlooking New York bounder with his slight slouch his dangerously
unsophisticatedlooking face and his American jocularity of slang
phrase

Hes of a class I know nothing about I own he puzzled me a trifle at
first Palliser said with his cool smile Im not sure that Ive got
on to him altogether yet Thats an expressive New York phrase of his
own But when we were strolling about together he made revelations
apparently without being in the least aware that they were revelations
He was unbelievable My fear was that he would not go on

But he did go on asked Amabel One must hear something of the
revelations

Then was given in the best possible form the little drama of the talk in
the garden No shade of Mr Temple Barholms characteristics was lost
Palliser gave occasionally an English attempt at the reproduction of his
nasal twang but it was only a touch and not sufficiently persisted in
to become undignified

I cant do it he said None of us can really do it When English
actors try it on the stage it is not in the least the real thing They
only drawl through their noses and it is more than that

The people of Detchworth Grange were not noisy people but their
laughter was unrestrained before the recital was finished Nobody had
gone so far as either to fear or to hope for anything as undiluted in
its nature as this was

Then he wont give us a chance the least chance cried Lucy and
Amabel almost in unison We are out of the running

You wont get even a look inbecause you are not ladies said their
brother

Poor Jem Temple Barholm What a different thing it would have been if
we had had him for a neighbor Mr Grantham fretted

We should have had Lady Joan Fayre as well said his wife

At least shes a gentlewoman as well as a lady Mr Grantham said
She would not have become so bitter if that hideous thing had not
occurred

They wondered if the new man knew anything about Jem Palliser had not
reached that part of his revelation when the laughter had broken into
it He told it forthwith and the laughter was overcome by a sort of
dismayed disgust This did not accord with the rumors of an almost
nice good nature

Theres a vulgar horridness about it said Lucy

What price Lady Mallowe said the son Ill bet a sovereign she began
it

She did remarked Palliser but I think one may leave Mr Temple
Barholm safely to Lady Joan Mr Grantham laughed as one who knew
something of Lady Joan

Theres an Americanism which I didnt learn from him Palliser added
and I remembered it when he was talking her over Its this when you
dispose of a person finally and forever you wipe up the earth with
him Lady Joan will wipe up the earth with your new neighbor

There was a little shout of laughter Wipe up the earth was entirely
new to everybody though even the country in England was at this time by
no means wholly ignorant of American slang

This led to so many other things both mirthprovoking and serious even
sometimes very serious indeed that the entire evening at Detchworth was
filled with talk of Temple Barholm Very naturally the talk did not end
by confining itself to one household In due time Captain Pallisers
little sketches were known in divers places and it became a habit to
discuss what had happened and what might possibly happen in the future
There were those who went to the length of calling on the new man
because they wanted to see him face to face People heard new things
every few days but no one realized that it was vaguely through Palliser
that there developed a general idea that crude and selfrevealing as
he was there lurked behind the outward candor of the intruder a hint of
oversharpness of the American kind There seemed no necessity for
him to lay schemes beyond those he had betrayed in his inquiries about
ladies but somehow it became a fixed idea that he was capable of
doing shady things if at any time the temptation arose That was really
what his boyish casualness meant That in truth was Pallisers final
secret conclusion And he wanted very much to find out why exactly
little old Miss Temple Barholm had been taken up If the man wanted
introductions he could have contrived to pick up a smart and
enterprising unprofessional chaperon in London who would have done for
him what Miss Temple Barholm would never presume to attempt And yet he
seemed to have chosen her deliberately He had set her literally at the
head of his house And Palliser having heard a vague rumor that he had
actually settled a decent income upon her had made adroit inquiries and
found it was true

It was To arrange the matter had been one of his reasons for going to
see Mr Palford during their stay in London

I wanted to fix youfix you safe he said when he told Miss Alicia
about it I guess no one can take it away from you whatever old thing
happens

What could happen dear Mr Temple Barholm said Miss Alicia in the
midst of tears of gratitude and tremulous joy You are so young and
strong andeverything Dont even speak of such a thing in jest What
could happen

Anything can happen he answered just anything Happenings the one
thing you cant bet on If I was betting Id put my money on the thing
I was sure couldnt happen Look at this Temple Barholm song and dance
Look at T T as he was half strangling in the blizzard up at Harlem
and thanking his stars little Munsberg didnt kick him out of his
confectionery store less than a year ago So long as Im all right
youre all right But I wanted you fixed anyhow

He paused and looked at her questioningly for a moment He wanted to
say something and he was not sure he ought His reverence for her little
finenesses and reserves increased instead of wearing away He was always
finding out new things about her

Say he broke forth almost impetuously after his hesitation I wish
you wouldnt call me Mr Temple Barholm

Ddo you she fluttered But what could I call you

Well he answered reddening a shade or so Id give a house and lot
if you could just call me Tem

But it would sound so unbecoming so familiar she protested

Thats just what Im asking for he saidsome one to be familiar
with Im the familiar kind Thats whats the matter with me Id be
familiar with Pearson but he wouldnt let me Id frighten him half to
death Hed think that he wasnt doing his duty and earning his wages
and that somehow hed get fired some day without a character

He drew nearer to her and coaxed

Couldnt you do it he asked almost as though he were asking a favor
of a girl Just Tem I believe that would come easier to you than T T
I get fonder and fonder of you every day Miss Alicia honest Injun And
Id be so grateful to you if youd just be that unbecomingly familiar

He looked honestly in earnest and if he grew fonder and fonder of her
she without doubt had in the face of everything given her whole heart
to him

Might I call you Templeto begin with she asked It touches me so
to think of your asking me I will begin at once Thank youTemple
with a faint gasp I might try the other a little later

It was only a few evenings later that he told her about the flats in
Harlem He had sent to New York for a large bundle of newspapers and
when he opened them he read aloud an advertisement and showed her a
picture of a large building given up entirely to flats

He had realized from the first that New York life had a singular
attraction for her The unrelieved dullness of her lifethose few
years of youth in which she had stifled vague longings for the joys
experienced by other girls the years of middle age spent in the
dreary effort to be submissive to the will of God which honestly
translated signified submission to the exactions and domestic tyrannies
of dear papa and others like himhad left her with her capacities for
pleasure as freshly sensitive as a childs The smallest change in the
routine of existence thrilled her with excitement Tembaroms casual
references to his strenuous boyhood caused her eyes to widen with
eagerness to hear more Having seen this he found keen delight in
telling her stories of New York lifestories of himself or of other
lads who had been his companions She would drop her work and gaze at
him almost with bated breath He was an excellent raconteur when he
talked of the things he knew well He had an unconscious habit of
springing from his seat and acting his scenes as he depicted them
laughing and using streetboy phrasing

Its just like a tale Miss Alicia would breathe enraptured as he
jumped from one story to another Its exactly like a wonderful tale

She learned to know the New York streets when they blazed with heat
when they were hard with frozen snow when they were sloppy with melting
slush or bright with springtime sunshine and spring winds blowing with
pretty women hurrying about in beflowered spring hats and dresses and
the exhilaration of the worldold springtime joy She found herself
hurrying with them She sometimes hung with him and his companions on
the railing outside dazzling restaurants where scores of gay people ate
rich food in the sight of their boyish ravenousness She darted in and
out among horses and vehicles to find carriages after the theater or
opera where everybody was dressed dazzlingly and diamonds glittered

Oh how rich everybody must have seemed to youhow cruelly rich poor
little boy

They looked rich right enough he answered when she said it And
there seemed a lot of good things to eat all corralled in a few places
And you wished you could be let loose inside But I dont know as it
seemed cruel That was the way it was you know and you couldnt help
it And there were places where theyd give away some of what was left
I tell you we were in luck then

There was some spirit in his telling it alla spirit which had surely
been with him through his hardest days a spirit of young mirth in
ragswhich made her feel subconsciously that the whole experience had
after all been somehow of the nature of lifes high adventure He had
never been ill or heartsick and he laughed when he talked of it as
though the remembrance was not a recalling of disaster

Clemmin or no clemmin I wish Id lived the loife thas lived
Tummas Hibblethwaite had said

Her amazement would indeed have been great if she had been told that she
secretly shared his feeling

It seems as if somehow you had never been dull was her method of
expressing it

Dull Holy cats no he grinned There wasnt any time for being
anything You just had to keep going

She became in time familiar with Mrs Bowses boardinghouse and
boarders She knew Mrs Peck and Mr Jakes and the young lady from the
notion counter those wonderful shops Julius and Jem and the hall
bedroom and the tilted chairs and cloud of smoke she saw so often that
she felt at home with them

Poor Mrs Bowse she said must have been a most respectable
motherly hardworking creature Really a nice person of her class She
could not quite visualize the parlor but it must have been warm and
comfortable And the pianolaa piano which you could play without even
knowing your notesWhat a clever invention America seemed full of the
most wonderfully clever things

Tembarom was actually uplifted in soul when he discovered that she laid
transparent little plans for leading him into talk about New York She
wanted him to talk about it and the Lord knows he wanted to talk
about himself He had been afraid at first She might have hated it
as Palford did and it would have hurt him somehow if she hadnt
understood But she did Without quite realizing the fact she was
beginning to love it to wish she had seen it Her Somerset vicarage
imagination did not allow of such leaps as would be implied by the
daring wish that sometime she might see it

But Tembaroms imagination was more athletic

Jinks wouldnt it be fine to take her there The lark in London
wouldnt be ace high to it

The Hutchinsons were not New Yorkers but they had been part of the
atmosphere of Mrs Bowses Mr Hutchinson would of course be rather a
forward and pushing man to be obliged to meet but Little Ann She
did so like Little Ann And the dear boy did so want in his heart of
hearts to talk about her at times She did not know whether in the
circumstances she ought to encourage him but he was so dear and
looked so much dearer when he even said Little Ann that she could not
help occasionally leading him gently toward the subject

When he opened the newspapers and found the advertisements of the flats
she saw the engaging halfawkward humorousness come into his eyes

Heres one that would do all right he saidfour rooms and a bath
eleventh floor thirtyfive dollars a month

He spread the newspaper on the table and rested on his elbow gazing
at it for a few minutes wholly absorbed Then he looked up at her and
smiled

Theres a plan of the rooms he said Would you like to look at it
Shall I bring your chair up to the table while we go over it together

He brought the chair and side by side they went over it thoroughly
To Miss Alicia it had all the interest of a new kind of puzzle He
explained it in every detail One of his secrets had been that on
several days when Galtons manner had made him hopeful he had visited
certain flat buildings and gone into their intricacies He could
therefore describe with color their resourcesthe janitor the
elevator the dumbwaiters to carry up domestic supplies and carry down
ashes and refuse the refrigerator the unlimited supply of hot and cold
water the heating plan the astonishing little kitchen with stationary
washtubs the telephone if you could afford itall the conveniences
which to Miss Alicia accustomed to the habits of Rowcroft Vicarage
where you lugged cans of water upstairs and down if you took a bath or
even washed your face seemed luxuries appertaining only to the rich and
great

How convenient How wonderful Dear me Dear me she said again and
again quite flushed with excitement It is like a fairystory And
its not big at all is it

You could get most of it into this he answered exulting You could
get all of it into that big whiteand gold parlor

The white saloon

He showed his teeth

I guess I ought to remember to call it that he said but it always
makes me think of Kid MacMurphys on Fourth Avenue He kept what was
called a saloon and hed had it painted white

Did you know him Miss Alicia asked

Know him Gee no I didnt fly as high as that Hed have thought me
pretty fresh if Id acted like I knew him He thought he was one of the
Four Hundred Hed been a prizefighter He was the fellow that knocked
out Kid Wilkens in four rounds He broke off and laughed at himself
Hear me talk to you about a tough like that he ended and he gave her
hand the little apologetic protective pat which always made her heart
beat because it was so nice

He drew her back to the advertisements and drew such interesting
pictures of what the lives of two peoplemother and son or father
and daughter or a young married couple who didnt want to put on
stylemight be in the tiny compartments that their excitement mounted
again

This could be a bedroom that could be a bedroom that could be the
livingroom and if you put a bit of bright carpet on the hallway and
hung up a picture or so it would look firstrate He even went into
the matter of measurements which made it more like putting a puzzle
together than ever and their relief when they found they could fit
a piece of furniture he called a lounge into a certain corner was a
thing of flushing delight The lounge she found was a sort of cot
with springs You could buy them for three dollars and when you put on
a mattress and covered it with a spread you could sit on it in the
daytime and sleep on it at night if you had to

From measurements he went into calculations about the cost of things
He had seen unpainted wooden tables you could put mahogany stain on and
theyd look all youd want Hed seen a splendid little rockingchair in
Second Avenue for five dollars one of the padded kind that ladies
like He had seen an armchair for a man that was only seven but there
mightnt be room for both and youd have to have the rockingchair He
had once asked the price of a lot of plates and cups and saucers with
roses on them and you could get them for six and you didnt need a
stove because there was the range

He had once heard Little Ann talking to Mrs Bowse about the price of
fryingpans and kettles and they seemed to cost next to nothing
Hed looked into store windows and noticed the prices of groceries
and vegetables and things like thatsugar for instance two people
wouldnt use much sugar in a weekand they wouldnt need a ton of tea
or flour or coffee If a fellow had a mother or sister or wife who had
a head and knew about things you could put it over on mighty little
and have a splendid time together too Youd even be able to work in a
cheap seat in a theater every now and then He laughed and flushed as he
thought of it

Miss Alicia had never had a dolls house Rowcroft Vicarage did not run
to dolls and their belongings Her thwarted longing for a dolls house
had a sort of parallel in her similarly thwarted longing for a little
boy

And here was her dolls house so long so long unpossessed It was like
that this absorbed contriving and fitting of furniture into corners
She also flushed and laughed Her eyes were so brightly eager and her
cheeks so pink that she looked quite girlish under her lace cap

How pretty and cozy it might be made how dear she exclaimed And
one would be so high up on the eleventh floor that one would feel like
a bird in a nest

His face lighted He seemed to like the idea tremendously

Why thats so he laughed That idea suits me down to the ground
A bird in a nest But thered have to be two One would be lonely Say
Miss Alicia how would you like to live in a place like that

I am sure any one would like itif they had some dear relative with
them

He loved her dear relative loved it He knew how much it meant of
what had lain hidden unacknowledged even unknown to her through a
lifetime in her earlyVictorian spinster breast

Lets go to New York and rent one and live in it together Would you
come he said and though he laughed he was not jocular in the usual
way Would you if we waked up and found this Temple Barholm thing was
a dream

Something in his manner she did not know what puzzled her a little

But if it were a dream you would be quite poor again she said
smiling

No I wouldnt Id get Galton to give me back the page Hed do it
quickquick he said still with a laugh Being poors nothing
anyhow Wed have the time of our lives Wed be two birds in a nest
You can look out those eleventhstory windows way over to the Bronx
and get bits of the river And perhaps after a while Ann would do like
she said and wed be three birds

Oh she sighed ecstatically How beautiful it would be We should be
a little family

So we should he exulted Think of T T with a family He drew his
paper of calculations toward him again Lets make believe were going
to do it and work out what it would costfor three You know about
housekeeping dont you Lets write down a list

If he had warmed to his work before he warmed still more after this
Miss Alicia was drawn into it again and followed his fanciful plans
with a new fervor They were like two children who had played at
makebelieve until they had lost sight of commonplace realities

Miss Alicia had lived among small economies and could be of great
assistance to him They made lists and added up lines of figures until
the fine huge room and its thousands of volumes melted away In the
great hall guarded by warriors in armor the powdered heads of the
waiting footmen drooped and nodded while the prices of pounds of butter
and sugar and the value of potatoes and flour and nutmegs were balanced
with a hectic joy and the relative significance of dollars and cents
and shillings and halfcrowns and fivecent pieces caused Miss Alicia a
mild delirium

By the time that she had established the facts that a shilling was
something like twentyfive cents a dollar was four and twopence
and twentyfive dollars was something over five pounds it was past
midnight

They heard the clock strike the halfhour and stopped to stare at each
other

Tembarom got up with yet another laugh

Say I mustnt keep you up all night he said But havent we had a
fine timehavent we I feel as if Id been there

They had been there so entirely that Miss Alicia brought herself back
with difficulty

I can scarcely believe that we have not she said I feel as if I
didnt like to leave it It was so delightful She glanced about her
The room looks huge she saidalmost too huge to live in

Doesnt it he answered Now you know how I feel He gathered his
scraps of paper together with a feeling touch I didnt want to come
back myself When I get a bit of a grouch I shall jerk these out and go
back there again

Oh do let me go with you she said I have so enjoyed it

You shall go whenever you like he said Well keep it up for a sort
of game on rainy days How much is a dollar Miss Alicia

Four and twopence And sugar is six cents a pound

Go to the head he answered Right again

The opened roll of newspapers was lying on the table near her They were
copies of The Earth and the date of one of them by merest chance caught
her eye

How odd she said Those are old papers Did you notice Is it a
mistake This one is dated She leaned forward and her eye caught a
word in a headline

The Klondike she read Theres something in it about the Klondike
He put his hand out and drew the papers away

Dont you read that he said I dont want you to go to bed and dream
about the Klondike Youve got to dream about the flat in Harlem

Yes she answered I mustnt think about sad things The flat in
Harlem is quite happy But it startled me to see that word

I only sent for thembecause I happened to want to look something up
he explained How much is a pound Miss Alicia

Four dollars and eightysix cents she replied recovering herself

Go up head again Youre going to stay there

When she gave him her hand on their parting for the night he held it a
moment A subtle combination of things made him do it The calculations
the measurements the nest from which one could look out over the Bronx
were prevailing elements in its makeup Ann had been in each room of
the Harlem flat and she always vaguely reminded him of Ann

We are relations aint we he asked

I am sure we often seem quite near relationsTemple She added the
name with very pretty kindness

Were not distant ones any more anyhow he said Are we near
enoughwould you let me kiss you good night Miss Alicia

An emotional flush ran up to her cap ribbons

Indeed my dear boyindeed yes

Holding her hand with a chivalric if slightly awkward courtesy he
bent and kissed her cheek It was a hearty affectionately grateful
young kiss which while it was for herself remotely included Ann

Its the first time Ive ever said good night to any one like that he
said Thank you for letting me

He patted her hand again before releasing it She went upstairs
blushing and feeling rather as though she had been proposed to and yet
spinster though she was somehow quite understanding about the nest and
Ann




CHAPTER XXI


Lady Mallowe and her daughter did not pay their visit to Asshawe Holt
the absolute though not openly referred to fact being that they had
not been invited The visit in question had merely floated in the air as
a delicate suggestion made by her ladyship in her letter to Mrs Asshe
Shaw to the effect that she and Joan were going to stay at Temple
Barholm the visit to Asshawe they had partly arranged some time ago
might now be fitted in

The partial arrangement itself Mrs Asshe Shaw remarked to her eldest
daughter when she received the suggesting note was so partial as to
require slight consideration since it had been made by the woman
herself who would push herself and her daughter into any house in
England if a back door were left open In the civilly phrased letter
she received in answer to her own Lady Mallowe read between the lines
the point of view taken and writhed secretly as she had been made to
writhe scores of times in the course of her career It had happened so
often indeed that it might have been imagined that she had become used
to it but the woman who acted as maid to herself and Joan always knew
when she had tried to get in somewhere and failed

The note of explanation sent immediately to Miss Alicia was at once
adroit and amiable They had unfortunately been detained in London a day
or two past the date fixed for their visit to Asshawe and Lady
Mallowe would not allow Mrs Asshe Shawe who had so many guests to
be inconvenienced by their arriving late and perhaps disarranging her
plans So if it was quite convenient they would come to Temple
Barholm a week earlier but not of course if that would be the least
upsetting

When they arrived Tembarom himself was in London He had suddenly found
he was obliged to go The business which called him was something which
could not be put off He expected to return at once It was made very
easy for him when he made his excuses to Palliser who suggested that
he might even find himself returning by the same train with his guests
which would give him opportunities If he was detained Miss Alicia
could take charge of the situation They would quite understand when she
explained Captain Palliser foresaw for himself some quiet entertainment
in his own meeting with the visitors Lady Mallowe always provided a
certain order of amusement for him and no man alive objected to finding
interest and even a certain excitement in the society of Lady Joan It
was her chief characteristic that she inspired in a man a vague even if
slightly irritated desire to please her in some degree To lead her
on to talk in her sometimes brilliant always heartlessly unsparing
fashion perhaps to smile her shade of a bitter smile gave a man
something to do especially if he was bored Palliser anticipated a
possible chance of repeating the dialogue of the ladies not however
going into the Jem Temple Barholm part of it When one finds a man whose
idle life has generated in him the curiosity which is usually called
feminine it frequently occupies him more actively than he is aware or
will admit

A fashionable male gossip is a curious development Palliser was upon
the whole not aware that he had an intense interest in finding out the
exact reason why Lady Mallowe had not failed utterly in any attempt to
drag her daughter to this particular place to be flung headlong so
to speak at this special man Lady Mallowe one could run and read but
Lady Joan was in this instance unexplainable And as she never deigned
the slightest concealment the story of the dialogue would no doubt
cause her to show her hand She must have a hand and it must be one
worth seeing

It was not he however who could either guess or understand The
following would have been his summing up of her Flaringly handsome
girl brought up by her mother to one end Bad temper to begin with
Girl who might if she lost her head get into some frightful mess
Meets a fascinating devil in the first season A regular Romeo and
Juliet passion blazes upall for love and the world well lost All
London looking on Lady Mallowe frantic and furious Suddenly the
fascinating devil ruined for life done for Bolts gets killed Lady
Mallowe triumphant Girl dragged about afterward like a beautiful young
demon in chains Refuses all sorts of things Behaves infernally Nobody
knows anything else

Nobody did know Lady Mallowe herself did not From the first year in
which Joan had looked at her with child consciousness she had felt
that there was antagonism in the deeps of her eyes No mother likes to
recognize such a thing and Lady Mallowe was a particularly vain woman
The child was going to be an undeniable beauty and she ought to adore
the mother who was to arrange her future Instead of which she plainly
disliked her By the time she was three years old the antagonism had
become defiance and rebellion Lady Mallowe could not even indulge
herself in the satisfaction of showing her embryo beauty off and thus
preparing a reputation for her She was not cross or tearful but she
had the temper of a little devil She would not be shown off She hated
it and her bearing dangerously suggested that she hated her handsome
young mother No effects could be produced with her

Before she was four the antagonism was mutual and it increased with
years The child was of a passionate nature and had been born intensely
all her mother was not and intensely not all her mother was A
throwback to some highspirited and fiercely honest ancestor created in
her a fury at the sight of mean falsities and dishonors Before she was
old enough to know the exact cause of her rage she was shaken by it She
thought she had a bad temper and was bad enough to hate her own mother
without being able to help it As she grew older she found out that
she was not really so bad as she had thought though she was obliged to
concede that nothing palliative could be said about the temper It had
been violent from the first and she had lived in an atmosphere which
infuriated it She did not suppose such a thing could be controlled
It sometimes frightened her Had not the old Marquis of Norborough
been celebrated through his entire life for his furies Was there not a
hushedup rumor that he had once thrown a decanter at his wife and so
nearly killed her that people had been asking one another in whispers if
a peer of the realm could be hanged He had been born that way so had
she Her schoolroom days had been a horror to her and also a terror
because she had often almost flung inkbottles and heavy rulers at her
silly lying governesses and once had dug a pair of scissors into one
sneaking old maid fools arm when she had made her see red by her
ignoble trickeries Perhaps she would be hanged some day herself She
once prayed for a week that she might be made better temperednot that
she believed in prayerand of course nothing came of it

Every year she lived she raged more furiously at the tricks she saw
played by her mother and every one who surrounded her the very servants
were greater liars and pilferers than any other servants Her mother was
always trying to get things from people which they did not want to give
her She would carry off slights and snubs as though they were actual
tributes if she could gain her end The girl knew what the meaning of
her own future would be Since she definitely disliked her daughter
Lady Mallowe did not mince matters when they were alone She had no
money she was extremely good looking she had a certain number of years
in which to fight for her own hand among the new debutantes who were
presented every season Her first season over the next season other
girls would be fresher than she was and newer to the men who were worth
marrying Men like novelty After her second season the debutantes would
seem fresher still by contrast Then people would begin to say She
was presented four or five years ago After that it would be all
struggleevery season it would be worse It would become awful
Unmarried women over thirtyfive would speak of her as though they had
been in the nursery together Married girls with a child or so would
treat her as though she were a maiden aunt She knew what was before
her Beggary stared them both in the face if she did not make the most
of her looks and waste no time And Joan knew it was all true and that
worse far worse things were true also She would be obliged to spend
a long life with her mother in cheap lodgings a faded penniless
unmarried woman railed at taunted sneered at forced to be part of
humiliating tricks played to enable them to get into debt and then to
avoid paying what they owed Had she not seen one horrible old woman of
their own rank who was an example of what poverty might bring one to
an old harpy who tried to queen it over her landlady in an actual back
street and was by turns fawned upon and disgustingly your ladyshiped
or outrageously insulted by her landlady

Then that first season Dear dear God that first season when she met
Jem She was not nineteen and the facile world pretended to be at her
feet and the sun shone as though London were in Italy and the park was
marvelous with flowers and there were such dances and such laughter

And it was all so youngand she met Jem It was at a gardenparty at
a lovely old house on the river a place with celebrated gardens which
would always come back to her memory as a riot of roses The frocks of
the people on the lawn looked as though they were made of the petals of
flowers and a mad little haunting waltz was being played by the band
and there under a great copper birch on the green velvet turf near her
stood Jem looking at her with dark liquid slanting eyes They were
only a few feet from each otherand he looked and she looked and the
haunting mad little waltz played on and it was as though they had been
standing there since the world began and nothing else was true

Afterward nothing mattered to either of them Lady Mallowe herself
ceased to count Now and then the world stops for two people in this
unearthly fashion At such times as far as such a pair are concerned
causes and effects cease Her bad temper fled and she knew she would
never feel its furious lash again

With Jem looking at her with his glowing drooping eyes there would be
no reason for rage and shame She confessed the temper to him and told
of her terror of it he confessed to her his fondness for high play and
they held each others hands not with sentimental youthful lightness
but with the strong clasp of sworn comrades and promised on honor that
they would stand by each other every hour of their lives against their
worst selves

They would have kept the pact Neither was a slight or dishonest
creature The phase of life through which they passed is not a new
one but it is not often so nearly an omnipotent power as was their
threemonths dream

It lasted only that length of time Then came the end of the world Joan
did not look fresh in her second season and before it was over men were
rather afraid of her Because she was so young the freshness returned to
her cheek but it never came back to her eyes

What exactly had happened or what she thought it was impossible to
know She had delicate black brows and between them appeared two
delicate fierce lines Her eyes were of a purplishgray the color of
thunder a snubbed admirer had once said Between their black lashes
they were more deeply thundercolored Her life with her mother was a
thing not to be spoken of To the desperate girls agony of rebellion
against the horror of fate Lady Mallowes taunts and beratings were
devilish There was a certain boudoir in the house in Hill Street which
was to Joan like the question chamber of the Inquisition Shut up in it
together the two went through scenes which in their cruelty would have
done credit to the Middle Ages Lady Mallowe always locked the door to
prevent the unexpected entrance of a servant but servants managed to
hover about it because her ladyship frequently forgot caution so far as
to raise her voice at times as ladies are not supposed to do

We fight Joan said with a short horrible laugh one morningwe
fight like cats and dogs No like two cats A catanddog fight is more
quickly over Some day we shall scratch each others eyes out

Have you no shame her mother cried

I am burning with it I am like St Lawrence on his gridiron Turn me
over on the other side she quoted

This was when she had behaved so abominably to the Duke of Merthshire
that he had actually withdrawn his more than halffinished proposal
That which she hated more than all else was the God she had prayed to
when she asked she might be helped to control her temper

She had not believed in Him at the time but because she was frightened
after she had stuck the scissors into Fraulein she had tried the appeal
as an experiment The night after she met Jem when she went to her
room in Hill Street for the night she knelt down and prayed because she
suddenly did believe Since there was Jem in the world there must be
the other somewhere

As day followed day her faith grew with her love She told Jem about
it and they agreed to say a prayer together at the same hour every
night The big young man thought her piety beautiful and his voice was
unsteady as they talked But she told him that she was not pious but
impious

I want to be made good she said I have been bad all my life I was
a bad child I have been a bad girl but now I must be good

On the night after the tragic cardparty she went to her room and
kneeled down in a new spirit She knelt but not to cover her face she
knelt with throat strained and her fierce young face thrown back and
upward

Her hands were clenched to fists and flung out and shaken at the
ceiling She said things so awful that her own blood shuddered as she
uttered them But she could notin her mad helplessnessmake them
awful enough She flung herself on the carpet at last her arms
outstretched like a creature crucified face downward on the cross

I believed in You she gasped The first moment you gave me a reason
I believed I did I did We both said our prayer to You every night
like children And youve done thisthisthis And she beat with her
fists upon the floor

Several years had passed since that night and no living being knew what
she carried in her soul If she had a soul she said to herself it was
blackblack But she had none Neither had Jem had one when the earth
and stones had fallen upon him it had been the end as it would have
been if he had been a beetle

This was the guest who was coming to the house where Miles Hugo smiled
from his frame in the picturegallerythe house which would today have
been Jems if T Tembarom had not inherited it

Tembarom returned some twentyfour hours after Miss Alicia had received
his visitors for him He had been going into absorbing things in
London His thoughts during his northward journey were puzzled and
discouraged ones He sat in the corner of the railway carriage and
stared out of the window without seeing the springtime changes in the
flying landscape

The price he would have given for a talk with Ann would not have been
easy to compute Her head her level little head and her way of seeing
into things and picking out facts without being rattled by what didnt
really count would have been worth anything The day itself was a
discouraging one with heavy threatenings of rain which did not fall

The low clouds were piles of darkpurple gray and when the sun tried
to send lances of ominous yellow light through them strange and lurid
effects were produced and the heavy purplegray masses rolled together
again He wondered why he did not hear low rumblings of thunder

He went to his room at once when he reached home He was late and
Pearson told him that the ladies were dressing for dinner Pearson was
in waiting with everything in readiness for the rapid performance of his
duties Tembarom had learned to allow himself to be waited upon He
had in fact done this for the satisfying of Pearson whose respectful
unhappiness would otherwise have been manifest despite his efforts
to conceal it He dressed quickly and asked some questions about
Strangeways Otherwise Pearson thought he seemed preoccupied He only
made one slight joke

Youd be a firstrate dresser for a quickchange artist Pearson he
remarked

On his way to the drawingroom he deflected from the direct path
turning aside for a moment to the picturegallery because for a reason
of his own he wanted to take a look at Miles Hugo He took a look at
Miles Hugo oftener than Miss Alicia knew

The gallery was dim and gloomy enough now closing in in the purplegray
twilight He walked through it without glancing at the pictures until
he came to the tall boy in the satin and lace of Charles II period
He paused there only for a short time but he stood quite near the
portrait and looked hard at the handsome face

Gee he exclaimed under his breath its queer gee

Then he turned suddenly round toward one of the big windows He turned
because he had been startled by a sound a movement Some one was
standing before the window For a seconds space the figure seemed
as though it was almost one with the purplegray clouds that were its
background It was a tall young woman and her dress was of a thin
material of exactly their colordarkgray and purple at once The
wearer held her head high and haughtily She had a beautiful stormy
face and the slender black brows were drawn together by a frown
Tembarom had never seen a girl as handsome and disdainful He had
indeed never been looked at as she looked at him when she moved
slightly forward

He knew who it was It was the Lady Joan girl and the sudden sight of
her momentarily rattled him

You quite gave me a jolt he said awkwardly and knowing that he said
it like a mutt I didnt know any one was in the gallery

What are you doing here she asked She spoke to him as though she
were addressing an intruding servant There was emphasis on the word
you

Her intention was so evident that it increased his feeling of being
rattled To find himself confronting deliberate ill nature of a
superior and finished kind was like being spoken to in a foreign
language

IIm T Tembarom he answered not able to keep himself from staring
because she was such a winner as to looks

T Tembarom she repeated slowly and her tone made him at once see
what a fool he had been to say it

I forgot he half laughed I ought to have said Im Temple Barholm

Oh was her sole comment She actually stood still and looked him up
and down

She knew perfectly well who he was and she knew perfectly well that no
palliative view could possibly be taken by any wellbred person of her
bearing toward him He was her host She had come a guest to his house
to eat his bread and salt and the commonest decency demanded that she
should conduct herself with civility But she cared nothing for the
commonest or the most uncommon decency She was thinking of other
things As she had stood before the window she had felt that her soul
had never been so black as it was when she turned away from Miles Hugos
portraitnever never She wanted to hurt people Perhaps Nero had felt
as she did and was not so hideous as he seemed

The mans tailor had put him into proper clothes and his features were
respectable enough but nothing on earth could make him anything but
what he so palpably was She had seen that much across the gallery as
she had watched him staring at Miles Hugo

I should think she said dropping the words slowly again that you
would often forget that you are Temple Barholm

Youre right there he answered I cant nail myself down to it It
seems like a sort of joke

She looked him over again

It is a joke she said

It was as though she had slapped him in the face though she said it so
quietly He knew he had received the slap and that as it was a woman
he could not slap back It was a sort of surprise to her that he did not
giggle nervously and turn red and shuffle his feet in impotent misery
He kept quite still a moment or so and looked at her though not as she
had looked at him She wondered if he was so thickskinned that he did
not feel anything at all

Thats so he admitted Thats so Then he actually smiled at her
I dont know how to behave myself you see he said Youre Lady
Joan Fayre aint you Im mighty glad to see you Happy to make your
acquaintance Lady Joan

He took her hand and shook it with friendly vigor before she knew what
he was going to do

Ill bet a dollar dinners ready he added and Burrills waiting
It scares me to death to keep Burrill waiting Hes got no use for me
anyhow Lets go and pacify him

He did not lead the way or drag her by the arm as it seemed to her
quite probable that he might as costermongers do on Hampstead Heath
He knew enough to let her pass first through the door and when Lady
Mallowe looked up to see her enter the drawingroom he was behind
her To her ladyships amazement and relief they came in so to speak
together She had been spared the trying moment of assisting at the
ceremony of their presentation to each other




CHAPTER XXII


In a certain sense she had been dragged to the place by her mother Lady
Mallowe had many resources and above all she knew how to weary her into
resistlessness which was almost indifference There had been several
shameless little scenes in the locked boudoir But though she had been
dragged she had come with an intention She knew what she would find
herself being forced to submit to if the intruder were not disposed of
at the outset and if the manoeuvering began which would bring him to
London He would appear at her elbow here and there and at every corner
probably unaware that he was being made an offensive puppet by the
astute cleverness against which she could not defend herself unless
she made actual scenes in drawingrooms at dinnertables in the very
streets themselves Gifted as Lady Mallowe was in fine and lighthanded
dealing of her cards in any game her stakes at this special juncture
were seriously high Joan knew what they were and that she was in a
mood touched with desperation The defenselessly new and ignorant Temple
Barholm was to her mind a direct intervention of Providence and it was
only Joan herself who could rob her of the benefits and reliefs he could
provide With regard to Lady Joan though Pallisers quoted New Yorkism
wipe up the earth was unknown to her the process she had in mind
when she left London for Lancashire would have been well covered by it
As in feudal days she might have ordered the right hand of a creature
such as this to be struck off forgetting that he was a man so was she
capable today of inflicting upon him any hurt which might sweep him out
of her way She had not been a tenderhearted girl and in these years
she was absolutely callous The fellow being what he was she had not
the resources she might have called upon if he had been a gentleman
He would not understand the chills and slights of good manners In
the country he would be easier to manage than in town especially if
attacked in his first timidity before his new grandeurs His big house
no doubt frightened him his servants the people who were of a class
of which he knew nothing When Palliser told his story she saw new
openings He would stand in servile awe of her and of others like her
He would be afraid of her to begin with and she could make him more
so

But though she had come to alarm him so that he would be put to absolute
flight she had also come for another reason She had never seen Temple
Barholm and she had discovered before they had known each other a week
that it was Jems secret passion He had loved it with a slighted and
lonely childs romantic longing he had dreamed of it as boy and man
knowing that it must some time be his own his home and yet prevented
by his uncles attitude toward him from daring to act as though he
remembered the fact Old Mr Temple Barholms special humor had been
that of a man guarding against presumption

Jem had not intended to presume but he had been snubbed with relentless
cruelty even for boyish expressions of admiration And he had hid his
feeling in his heart until he poured it out to Joan Today it would
have been his Together together they would have lived in it and loved
every stone of it every leaf on every great tree every wild daffodil
nodding in the green grass Most people God be thanked can forget The
wise ones train themselves beyond all else to forgetting

Joan had been a luckless illbroughtup passionate child and girl In
her Mayfair nursery she had been as little trained as a young savage
Since her black hour she had forgotten nothing allowed herself no
palliating moments Her brief dream of young joy had been the one
real thing in her life She absolutely had lain awake at night and
reconstructed the horror of Jems death had lived it over again
writhing in agony on her bed and madly feeling that by so doing she was
holding her love close to her life

And the man who stood in the place Jem had longed for the man who sat
at the head of his table was this thing That was what she felt him
to be and every hurt she could do him every humiliation which should
write large before him his presumption and grotesque unfitness would be
a blow struck for Jem who could never strike a blow for himself again
It was all senseless but she had not want to reason Fate had not
reasoned in her behalf She watched Tembarom under her lids at the
dinnertable

He had not wriggled or shuffled when she spoke to him in the gallery he
did neither now and made no obvious efforts to seem unembarrassed
He used his knife and fork in odd ways and he was plainly not used to
being waited upon More than once she saw the servants restrain smiles
She addressed no remarks to him herself and answered with chill
indifference such things as he said to her If conversation had flagged
between him and Mr Palford because the solicitor did not know how
to talk to him it did not even reach the point of flagging with her
because she would not talk and did not allow it to begin Lady Mallowe
sick with annoyance was quite brilliant She drew out Miss Alicia by
detailed reminiscences of a visit paid to Rowlton Hall years before
The vicar had dined at the hall while she had been there She remembered
perfectly his charm of manner and powerful originality of mind she said
sweetly He had spoken with such affection of his little Alicia who
was such a help to him in his parish work

I thought he was speaking of a little girl at first she said
smilingly but it soon revealed itself that little Alicia was only
his caressing diminutive

A certain widening of Miss Alicias fascinated eye which could not
remove itself from her face caused her to quail slightly

He was of course a man of great force of character andand
expression she added I remember thinking at the time that his
eloquent frankness of phrase might perhaps seem even severe to frivolous
creatures like myself A really remarkable personality

His sermons faltered Miss Alicia as a refuge were indeed
remarkable I am sure he must greatly have enjoyed his conversations
with you I am afraid there were very few clever women in the
neighborhood of Rowlton

Casting a bitter side glance on her silent daughter Lady Mallowe
lightly seized upon New York as a subject She knew so much of it from
delightful New Yorkers London was full of delightful New Yorkers
She would like beyond everything to spend a winter in New York She
understood that the season there was in the winter and that it was most
brilliant Mr Temple Barholm must tell them about it

Yes said Lady Joan looking at him through narrowed lids Mr Temple
Barholm ought to tell us about it

She wanted to hear what he would say to see how he would try to get out
of the difficulty or flounder staggeringly through it Her mother knew
in an instant that her own speech had been a stupid blunder She had put
the man into exactly the position Joan would enjoy seeing him in But he
wasnt in a position it appeared

What is the season anyhow he said Youve got one on me when you
talk about seasons

In London Miss Alicia explained courageously it is the time when
her Majesty is at Buckingham Palace and when the drawingrooms are
held and Parliament sits and people come up to town and give balls

She wished that Lady Mallowe had not made her remark just at this time
She knew that the quietly moving servants were listening and that their
civilly averted eyes had seen Captain Palliser smile and Lady Joans
curious look and that the whole incident would form entertainment for
their suppertable

I guess they have it in the winter in New York then if thats it
he said Theres no Buckingham Palace there and no drawingrooms and
Congress sits in Washington But New York takes it out in suppers at
Sherrys and Delmonicos and theaters and receptions Miss Alicia knows
how I used to go to them when I was a little fellow dont you Miss
Alicia he added smiling at her across the table

You have told me she answered She noticed that Burrill and the
footmen stood at attention in their places

I used to stand outside in the snow and look in through the windows
at the people having a good time he said Us kids that were selling
newspapers used to try to fill ourselves up with choosing whose plate
wed take if we could get at it Beefsteak and French fried potatoes
were the favorites and hot oyster stews We were so allfired hungry

How pathetic exclaimed Lady Mallowe And how interesting now that
it is all over

She knew that her manner was gushing and Joans slight side glance of
subtle appreciation of the fact exasperated her almost beyond endurance
What could one do what could one talk about without involving oneself
in difficulties out of which ones hasty retreat could be effected
only by gushing Taking into consideration the awkwardness of the whole
situation and seeing Joans temper and attitude if there had not been
so much at stake she would have received a summoning telegram from
London the next day and taken flight But she had been forced to hold
her ground before in places she detested or where she was not wanted
and she must hold it again until she had found out the worst or the
best And great heaven how Joan was conducting herself with that
slow quiet insultingness of tone and look the wicked silent insolence
of bearing which no man was able to stand however admiringly he began
The Duke of Merthshire had turned his back upon it even after all
the world had known his intentions even after the newspapers had
prematurely announced the engagement and she herself had been convinced
that he could not possibly retreat She had worked desperately that
season she had fawned on and petted newspaper people and stooped to
little things no one but herself could have invented and which no one
but herself knew of And never had Joan been so superb her beauty
had seemed at its most brilliant height The match would have been
magnificent but he could not stand her and would not Why indeed
should any man She glanced at her across the table A beauty of
course but she was thinner and her eyes had a hungry fierceness in
them and the two delicate straight lines between her black brows were
deepening

And there were no dukes on the horizon Merthshire had married almost
at once and all the others were too young or had wives already If this
man would take her she might feel herself lucky Temple Barholm and
seventy thousand a year were not to be trifled with by a girl who had
made herself unpopular and who was twentysix And for her own luck the
moment had come just before it was too latea second marriage wealth
the end of the hideous struggle Joan was the obstacle in her path and
she must be forced out of it She glanced quickly at Tembarom He was
trying to talk to Joan now He was trying to please her She evidently
had a fascination for him He looked at her in a curious way when she
was not looking at him It was a way different from that of other men
whom she had watched as they furtively stared It had struck her that he
could not take his eyes away That was because he had never before been
on speaking terms with a woman of beauty and rank

Joan herself knew that he was trying to please her and she was asking
herself how long he would have the courage and presumption to keep it
up He could scarcely be enjoying it

He was not enjoying it but he kept it up He wanted to be friends with
her for more reasons than one No one had ever remained long at enmity
with him He had got over a good many people in the course of his
career as he had got over Joseph Hutchinson This had always been
accomplished because he presented no surface at which arrows could be
thrown She was the hardest proposition he had ever come up against he
was thinking but if he didnt let himself be fool enough to break loose
and get mad shed not hate him so much after a while She would begin
to understand that it wasnt his fault then perhaps he could get her to
make friends In fact if she had been able to read his thoughts there
is no certainty as to how far her temper might have carried her But
she could see him only as a sharpfaced common American of the shopboy
class sitting at the head of Jem Temple Barholms table in his chair

As they passed through the hall to go to the drawingroom after the meal
was over she saw a neat pale young man speaking to Burrill and heard a
few of his rather anxiously uttered words

The orders were that he was always to be told when Mr Strangeways was
like this under all circumstances I cant quiet him Mr Burrill He
says he must see him at once

Burrill walked back stiffly to the diningroom

It wont trouble HIM much to be disturbed at his wine he muttered
before going He doesnt know hock from port

When the message was delivered to him Tembarom excused himself with
simple lack of ceremony

I ll be back directly he said to Palliser Those are good cigars
And he left the room without going into the matter further

Palliser took one of the good cigars and in taking it exchanged a
glance with Burrill which distantly conveyed the suggestion that perhaps
he had better remain for a moment or so Captain Pallisers knowledge of
interesting detail was obtained by chance here and there he sometimes
explained but it was always obtained with a light and casual air

I am not sure he remarked as he took the light Burrill held for
him and touched the end of his cigarI am not quite sure that I know
exactly who Mr Strangeways is

Hes the gentleman sir that Mr Temple Barholm brought over from New
York replied Burrill with a stolidity clearly expressive of distaste

Indeed from New York Why doesnt one see him

Hes not in a condition to see people sir said Burrill and
Pallisers slightly lifted eyebrow seeming to express a good deal he
added a sentence Hes not all there sir

From New York and not all there What seems to be the matter
Palliser asked quietly Odd idea to bring a lunatic all the way from
America There must be asylums there

Us servants have orders to keep out of the way Burrill said with
sterner stolidity Hes so nervous that the sight of strangers does him
harm I may say that questions are not encouraged

Then I must not ask any more said Captain Palliser I did not know I
was edging on to a mystery

I wasnt aware that I was myself sir Burrill remarked until I
asked something quite ordinary of Pearson who is Mr Temple Barholms
valet and it was not what he said but what he didnt that showed me
where I stood

A mystery is an interesting thing to have in a house said Captain
Palliser without enthusiasm He smoked his cigar as though he was
enjoying its aroma and even from his first remark he had managed not to
seem to be really quite addressing himself to Burrill He was certainly
not talking to him in the ordinary way his air was rather that of
a gentleman overhearing casual remarks in which he was only vaguely
interested Before Burrill left the room however and he left it under
the impression that he had said no more than civility demanded Captain
Palliser had reached the point of being able to deduce a number of
things from what he like Pearson had not said




CHAPTER XXIII


The man who in all England was most deeply submerged in deadly boredom
was the old Duke of Stone said with wearied finality himself He had
been a sinful young man of finished taste in 1820 he had cultivated
these tastes which were for literature and art and divers other things
in the most richly alluring foreign capitals until finding himself
becoming an equally sinful and finished elderly man he had decided to
marry After the birth of her four daughters his wife had died and left
them on his hands Developing at that time a tendency to rheumatic gout
and a daily increasing realization of the fact that the resources of
a poor dukedom may be hopelessly depleted by an expensive youth passed
brilliantly in Vienna Paris Berlin and London when it was endurable
he found it expedient to give up what he considered the necessities
of life and to face existence in the country in England It is not
imperative that one should enter into detail There was much and it
covered years during which his four daughters grew up and he grew
down as he called it If his temper had originally been a bad one it
would doubtless have become unbearable as he had been born an amiable
person he merely sank into the boredom which threatens extinction
His girls bored him his neighbors bored him Stone Hover bored him
Lancashire bored him England had always bored him except at abnormal
moments

I read a great deal I walk when I can this he wrote once to a friend
in Rome When I am too stiff with rheumatic gout I drive myself about
in a pony chaise and feel like an aunt in a Bath chair I have so
far escaped the actual chair itself It perpetually rains here I may
mention so I dont get out often You who gallop on white roads in the
sunshine and hear Italian voices and vowels figure to yourself your
friend trundling through damp leadcolored Lancashire lanes and being
addressed in the Lancashire dialect But so am I driven by necessity
that I listen to it gratefully I want to hear village news from
villagers I have become a gossip It is a wonderful thing to be a
gossip It assists one to get through ones declining years Do not wait
so long as I did before becoming one Begin in your roseate middle age

An attack of gout more severe than usual had confined him to his room
for some time after the arrival of the new owner of Temple Barholm
He had in fact been so far indisposed that a week or two had passed
before he had heard of him His favorite nurse had been chosen by him
because she was a comfortable village woman whom he had taught to lay
aside her proper awe and talk to him about her own affairs and her
neighbors when he was in the mood to listen She spoke the broadest
possible dialecthe liked dialect having learned much in his youth
from melloweyed Neapolitan and Tuscan girlsand she had never been
near a hospital but had been trained by the bedsides of her children
and neighbors

If I were a writing person she would become literature impinging upon
Miss Mitfords tales of Our Village Miss Austens varieties and the
young Bronte womans Wuthering Heights Mon Dieu what a resource it
would be to be a writing person he wrote to the Roman friend

To his daughters he said

She brings back my tenderest youth When she pokes the fire in the
twilight and lumbers about the room making me comfortable I lie in my
bed and watch the flames dancing on the ceiling and feel as if I were
six and had the measles She tucks me in my dearsshe tucks me in I
assure you Sometimes I feel it quite possible that she will bend over
and kiss me

She had tucked him in luxuriously in his armchair by the fire on the
first day of his convalescence and as she gave him his tray with his
beef tea and toast he saw that she contained anecdotal information of
interest which tactful encouragement would cause to flow

Now that I am well enough to be entertained Braddle he said tell
me what has been happening

A graidely lot yore Grace she answered but not so much i Stone
Hover as i Temple Barholm Hes coom

Then the duke vaguely recalled rumors he had heard sometime before his
indisposition

The new Mr Temple Barholm Hes an American isnt he The lost heir
who had to be sought for high and lowprincipally low I understand

The beef tea was excellently savory the fire was warm and relief from
two weeks of pain left a sort of Nirvana of peace Rarely had the duke
passed a more delightfully entertaining morning There was a richness
in the Temple Barholm situation as described in detail by Mrs Braddle
which filled him with delight His regret that he was not a writing
person intensified itself Americans had not appeared upon the horizon
in Miss Mitfords time or in Miss Austens or in the Brontes the
type not having entirely detached itself from that of the red Indian It
struck him however that Miss Austen might have done the best work with
this affair if she had survived beyond her period Her finely demure and
sly sense of humor would have seen and seized upon its opportunities
Stark moorland life had not encouraged humor in the Brontes and village
patronage had not roused in Miss Mitford a sense of ironic contrasts
Yes Jane Austen would have done it best

That the story should be related by Mrs Braddle gave it extraordinary
flavor No man or woman of his own class could have given such a
recounting or revealed so many facets of this jewel of entertainment
He and those like him could have seen the thing only from their own
amused outraged bewildered or cynically disgusted point of view
Mrs Braddle saw it as the villagers saw itexcited curious secretly
hopeful of undue lavishness from a chap as had nivver had brass before
an wants to chuck it away for brags sake or somewhat alarmed at the
possible neglecting of customs and privileges by a person ignorant
of memorial benefactions She saw it as the servants saw itsecretly
disdainful outwardly respectful waiting to discover whether the
sacrifice of professional distinction would be balanced by liberties
permitted and lavishness of remuneration and largess She saw it also
from her own point of viewthat of a respectable cottage dweller whose
greatgreatgrandfather had been born in a blackandwhite timbered
house in a green lane and who knew what were gentry ways and what
nature of being could never even remotely approach the assumption of
them She had seen Tembarom more than once and summed him up by no
means illnaturedly

Hes not such a badlookin chap He is na shortlegged or
turnupnosed an thats summat He con stride along an he looks
healthy enow for aw hes thin A thin chap nivver looks as common as a
fat un If he wur pudgy it ud be a lot more agen him

I think perhaps amiably remarked the duke sipping his beef tea
that you had better not call him a chap Braddle The late Mr Temple
Barholm was never referred to as a chap exactly was he

Mrs Braddle gave vent to a sort of internalsounding chuckle She had
not meant to be impertinent and she knew her charge was aware that she
had not and that he was neither being lofty or severe with her

Eh Id aloiked to ha heard somebody do it when he was nigh she
said Happen Id better be moindin ma Ps an Qs a bit more But
thats what this un is yore Grace Hes a chap out an out An
theers some as is sayin hes not a bad sort of a chap either Theres
lots o funny stories about him i Temple Barholm village He goes in to
th cottages now an then an though a fool could see he does na know
his place nor other peoples hes downreet openhanded An he maks
foak laugh He took a lot o New York papers wi big pictures in em
to little Tummas Hibblethwaite An wot does tha think he did one rainy
day He walks in to the owd Dibdens cottage an sits down betwixt em
as they sit one each side o th fre an he tells em theyve got to
cheer him up a bit becos hes got nought to do An he shows em th
picterpapers too an tells em about New York an he ends up wi
singin em a comic song They was frightened out o their wits at
first but somehow he got over em an made em laugh their owd heads
nigh off

Her charge laid his spoon down and his shrewd lined face assumed a new
expression of interest

Did he Did he indeed he exclaimed Good Lord what an exhilarating
person I must go and see him Perhaps hed make me laugh my owd head
nigh off What a sensation

There was really immense color in the anecdotes and in the side views
accompanying them the routing out of her obscurity of the isolated
dependent spinster relative for instance Delicious The man was either
desperate with loneliness or he was one of the roughdiamond benefactors
favored by novelists in which latter case he would not be so
entertaining Pure selfinterest caused the Duke of Stone quite
unreservedly to hope that he was anguished by the unaccustomedness of
his surroundings and was ready to pour himself forth to any one who
would listen There would be originality in such a situation and one
could draw forth revelations worth forming an audience to He himself
had thought that the volteface such circumstances demanded would surely
leave a man staring at things foreign enough to bore him This indeed
had been one of his cherished theories but the only man he had ever
encountered who had become a sort of millionaire between one day
and another had been an appalling Yorkshire man who had had some
extraordinary luck with diamondmines in South Africa and he had been
simply drunk with exhilaration and the delight of spending money with
both hands while he figuratively slapped on the back persons who six
weeks before would have kicked him for doing it

This man did not appear to be excited The duke mentally rocked with
gleeful appreciation of certain things Mrs Braddle detailed She
gave of course Burrills version of the brief interview outside the
diningroom door when Miss Alicias status in the household bad been
made clear to him But the duke being a man endowed with a subtle sense
of shades was wholly enlightened as to the inner meaning of Burrills
master

Now that was good he said to himself almost chuckling By the
Lord the man might have been a gentleman

When to all this was added the story of the friend or poor relative or
what not who was supposed to be not quoite reet i th yed and was
taken care of like a prince in complete isolation attended by a valet
visited and cheered up by his benefactor he felt that a boon had
indeed been bestowed upon him It was a nineteenth century Mysteries of
Udolpho in embryo though too greatly diluted by the fact that though
the stranger was seen by no one the new Temple Barholm made no secret
of him

If he had only made a secret of him the whole thing would have been
complete There was of course in the situation a discouraging suggestion
that Temple Barholm MIGHT turn out to be merely the ordinary noble
character bestowing boons

I will burn a little candle to the Virgin and offer up prayers that
he may NOT That sort of thing would have no cachet whatever and would
only depress me thought his still sufficiently sinful Grace

When Braddle do you think I shall be able to take a drive again he
asked his nurse

Braddle was not prepared to say upon her own responsibility but the
doctor would tell him when he came in that afternoon

I feel astonishingly well considering the sharpness of the attack
her patient said Our little talk has quite stimulated me When I go
outthere was a gleam in the eye he raised to hersI am going to
call at Temple Barholm

I knowed tha would she commented with maternal familiarity I dunnot
believe tha could keep away

And through the rest of the morning as he sat and gazed into the
fire she observed that he several times chuckled gently and rubbed his
delicate chill swollen knuckled hands together

A few weeks later there were some warm days and his Grace chose to go
out in his pony carriage Much as he detested the suggestion of the
aunt in the Bath chair he had decided that he found the low informal
vehicle more entertaining than a more imposing one and the desperation
of his desire to be entertained can be comprehended only by those who
have known its parallel If he was not in some way amused he found
himself whirling with rheumatic gout and seventy years among
recollections of vivid pictures better hung in galleries with closed
doors It was always possible to stop the pony carriage to look at
viewsbits of landscape caught at by vision through trees or under
their spreading branches or at the end of little greenhedged lanes
apparently adorned with cottages or farmhouses with ricks and
barnyards and pigpens designed for the benefit of Morland and other
painters of rusticity He could also slacken the ponys pace and draw up
by roadsides where solitary men sat by piles of stone which they broke
at leisure with hammers as though they were cracking nuts He had spent
many an agreeable halfhour in talk with a roadmender who could be led
into conversation and was left elated by an extra shilling As in years
long past he had sat under chestnuttrees in the Apennines and shared
the black bread and sour wine of a peasant so in these days he
frequently would have been glad to sit under a hedge and eat bread and
cheese with a good fellow who did not know him and whose summing up of
the domestic habits and needs of th workin mon or the amiabilities
or degeneracies of the gentry would be expressed figuratively speaking
in thoughts and words of one syllable The pony however could not
take him very far afield and one could not lunch on the grass with a
stonebreaker well within reach of ones own castle without an air of
eccentricity which he no more chose to assume than he would have chosen
to wear long hair and a flowing necktie Also rheumatic gout had
not hovered about the days in the Apennines He did not it might be
remarked desire to enter into conversation with his humble fellowman
from altruistic motives He did it because there was always a chance
more or less that he would be amused He might hear of little tragedies
or comedieshe much preferred the comediesand he often learned new
words or phrases of dialect interestingly allied to pure AngloSaxon
When this last occurred he entered them in a notebook he kept in his
library He sometimes pretended to himself that he was going to write a
book on dialects but he knew that he was a dilettante sort of creature
and would really never do it The pretense however was a sort of
asset In dire moments during rains or foggy weather when he felt
twinges and had read till his head ached he had wished that he had
not eaten all his cake at the first course of lifes feast that he had
formed a habit or so which might have survived and helped him to eke out
even an easychair existence through the last courses He did not
find consolation in the use of the palliative adjective as applied to
himself A neatly cynical sense of humor prevented it He knew he had
always been an entirely selfish man and that he was entirely selfish
still and was not revoltingly fretful and domineering only because he
was constitutionally unirritable

He was however amiably obstinate and was accustomed to getting his
own way in most things On this day of his outing he insisted on driving
himself in the face of arguments to the contrary He was so fixed in
his intention that his daughters and Mrs Braddle were obliged to admit
themselves overpowered

Nonsense Nonsense he protested when they besought him to allow
himself to be driven by a groom The pony is a fat thing only suited to
a Bath chair He does not need driving He doesnt go when he is driven
He frequently lies down and puts his cheek on his hand and goes to
sleep and I am obliged to wait until he wakes up

But papa dear Lady Edith said your poor hands are not very
strong And he might run away and kill you Please do be reasonable

My dear girl he answered if he runs I shall run after him and kill
him when I catch him George he called to the groom holding the plump
ponys head tell her ladyship what this little beasts name is

The Indolent Apprentice your Grace the groom answered touching his
hat and suppressing a grin

I called him that a month ago said the duke Hogarth would have
depicted all sorts of evil ends for him Three weeks since when I
was in bed being fed by Braddle with a spoon I could have outrun him
myself Let George follow me on a horse if you like but he must keep
out of my sight Half a mile behind will do

He got into the phaeton concealing his twinges with determination and
drove down the avenue with a fine air sitting erect and smiling Indoor
existence had become unendurable and the spring was filling the woods

I love the spring he murmured to himself I am sentimental about it
I love sentimentality in myself when I am quite alone If I had been
a writing person I should have made verses every year in April and sent
them to magazinesand they would have been returned to me

The Indolent Apprentice was it is true fat though comely and he was
also entirely deserving of his name Like his Grace of Stone however
he had seen other and livelier days and now and then he was beset by
recollections He was still a rather high though slow stepperthe
latter from fixed preference He had once stepped fast as well as with
a spirited gait During his masters indisposition he had stood in his
loose box and professed such harmlessness that he had not been annoyed
by being taken out for exercise as regularly as he might have been He
had champed his oats and listened to the repartee of the stableboys
and he had perhaps felt the coming of the spring when the cuckoo
insisted upon it with thrilling mellowness across the green sweeps of
the park land Sometimes it made him sentimental as it made his master
sometimes it made him stamp his small hoofs restlessly in his straw and
want to go out He did not intend when he was taken out to emulate the
Industrious Apprentice by hastening his pace unduly and raising false
hopes for the future but he sniffed in the air the moist green of
leafage and damp moss massed with yellow primroses cuddling in it as
though for warmth and he thought of other fresh scents and the feel of
the road under a ponys feet

Therefore when he found himself out in the world again he shook his
head now and then and even tossed it with the recurring sensations of a
pony who was a mere boy and still slight in the waist

You feel it too do you said the duke I wont remind you of your
years

The drive from Stone Hover to the village of Temple Barholm was an easy
one of many charms of leafarched lanes and greenedged road The duke
had always had a partiality for it and he took it this morning He
would probably have taken it in any case but Mrs Braddles anecdotes
had been floating through his mind when he set forth and perhaps
inclined him in its direction

The groom was a young man of three and twenty and he felt the spring
also The horse he rode was a handsome animal and he himself was not
devoid of a healthy young mans good looks He knew his belted livery
was becoming to him and when on horseback he prided himself on what
he considered an almost military bearing Sarah Hibson farmer Hibsons
dimplechinned and saucyeyed daughter had been carryin on a good
bit with a soldier who was a smart wellsetup impudent fellow and
it was the manifest duty of any other young fellow who had considered
himself to be walking out with her to look after his charges His
Grace had been most particular about Georges keeping far enough behind
him and as half a mile had been mentioned as near enough certainly one
was absolved from the necessity of keeping in sight Why should not one
turn into the lane which ended at Hibsons farmyard and drop into the
dairy and have it out wi Sarah

Dimpled chins and saucy eyes and bare dimpled arms and hands patting
butter while heads are tossed in coquettishly alluring defiance made
even having it out an attractive and memoryobscuring process Sarah
was a plump and sparkling imp of prettiness and knew the power of every
sly glance and every dimple and every golden freckle she possessed
George did not know it so well and in ten minutes had lost his head and
entirely forgotten even the halfmile behind

He was loverlike he was masterful he brought the spring with him he
carried on as Sarah put it until he had actually outdistanced
the soldier and had her in his arms kissing her as she laughed and
prettily struggled

Shame o tha face Shame o tha face George she scolded and dimpled
and blushed Wilt tha be done now Wilt tha be done Ill call mother

And at that very moment mother came without being called running red
of face heavyfooted and panting with her cap all on one side

Th dukes run away Th dukes run away she shouted Jo seed him
Pony got freetened at summatan what art doin here George Bind Get
o thy horse an gallop If hes killed tha rt a ruined man

There was an odd turn of chance in it the duke thought afterward
Though friskier than usual the Indolent Apprentice had behaved
perfectly well until they neared the gates of Temple Barholm which
chanced to be open because a cart had just passed through And it was
not the carts fault for the Indolent Apprentice regarded it with
friendly interest It happened however that perhaps being absorbed
in the cart which might have been drawn by a friend or even a distant
relative the Indolent Apprentice was horribly startled by a large
rabbit which leaped out of the hedge almost under his nose and worse
still was followed the next instant by another rabbit even larger and
more sudden and unexpected in its movements The Indolent Apprentice
snorted pawed whirled dashed through the open gatewaythe dukes
hands were even less strong than his daughter had thoughtand
galloped head in air and bit between teeth up the avenue the low
carriage rocking from side to side

Damn Damn cried the duke rocking also Oh damn I shall be killed
in a runaway perambulator

And ridiculous as it was things surged through his brain and once
though he laughed at himself bitterly afterward he gasped Ah
Heloise as he almost whirled over a jagged treestump gallop and
gallop and gallop off the road and through trees and back again on to
the sward and gallop and gallop and jerk and jolt and jerk and he
was nearing the house and a longlegged young man ran down the steps
pushing aside footmen and was ahead of the drunken little beast of a
pony and caught him just as the phaeton overturned and shot his grace
safely though not comfortably in a heap upon the grass

It was of course no trifle of a shock but its victims sensations gave
him strong reason to hope as he rolled over that no bones were broken
The following servants were on the spot almost at once and took the
ponys head

The young man helped the duke to his feet and dusted him with masterly
dexterity He did not know he was dusting a duke and he would not have
cared if he had

Hello he said youre not hurt I can see that Thank the Lord I
dont believe youve got a scratch

His grace felt a shade shaky and he was slightly pale but he smiled
in a way which had been celebrated forty years earlier and the charm of
which had survived even rheumatic gout

Thank you Im not hurt in the least I am the Duke of Stone This
isnt really a call It isnt my custom to arrive in this way May I
address you as my preserver Mr Temple Barholm




CHAPTER XXIV


Upon the terrace when he was led up the steps stood a most perfect
little elderly lady in a state of agitation much greater than his own or
his rescuers It was an agitation as perfect in its femininity as she
herself was It expressed its kind tremors in the fashion which belonged
to the puce silk dress and fine bits of collar and undersleeve the
belated gracefulness of which caused her to present herself to him
rather as a figure cut neatly from a book of the styles he had admired
in his young manhood It was of course Miss Alicia who having with
Tembarom seen the galloping pony from a window had followed him when
he darted from the room She came forward looking pale with charming
solicitude

I do so hope you are not hurt she exclaimed It really seemed that
only divine Providence could prevent a terrible accident

I am afraid that it was more grotesque than terrible he answered a
shade breathlessly

Let me make you acquainted with the Duke of Stone Miss Alicia
Tembarom said in the formula of Mrs Bowses boarders on state
occasions of introduction Duke let me make you acquainted sir with
myrelationMiss Alicia Temple Barholm

The dukes bow had a remote suggestion of almost including a kissed hand
in its gallant courtesy Not however that Early Victorian ladies had
been accustomed to the kissing of hands but at the period when he had
best known the type he had daily bent over white fingers in Continental
capitals

A glass of wine Miss Alicia implored Pray let me give you a glass
of wine I am sure you need it very much

He was taken into the library and made to sit in a most comfortable
easychair Miss Alicia fluttered about him with sympathy still
delicately tinged with alarm How long how long it had been since he
had been fluttered over Nearly forty years Ladies did not flutter
now and he remembered that it was no longer the fashion to call them
ladies Only the lowermiddle classes spoke of ladies But he found
himself mentally using the word again as he watched Miss Alicia

It had been ladies who had fluttered and been anxious about a man in
this quite pretty way

He could scarcely remove his eyes from her as he sipped his wine She
felt his escape providential and murmured such devout little phrases
concerning it that he was almost consoled for the grotesque inward
vision of himself as an aged peer of the realm tumbling out of a
babycarriage and rolled over on the grass at the feet of a man on whom
later he had meant to make in proper state a formal call She put her
hand to her side smiling half apologetically

My heart beats quite fast yet she said Whereupon a quaintly novel
thing took place at the sight of which the duke barely escaped opening
his eyes very wide indeed The American Temple Barholm put his arm about
her in the most casual and informally accustomed way and led her to a
chair and put her in it so to speak

Say he announced with affectionate authority you sit down right
away Its you that needs a glass of wine and Im going to give it to
you

The relations between the two were evidently on a basis not common in
England even among people who were attached to one another There was a
spontaneous everyday air of natural protective petting about it as
though the fellow was fond of her in his crude fashion and meant to
take care of her He was fond of her and the duke perceived it with
elation and also understood He might be the ordinary bestower of
boons but the protective curve of his arm included other things In the
blank dullness of his unaccustomed splendors he had somehow encountered
this fine delicately preserved little relic of other days and had
seized on her and made her his own

I have not seen anything as delightful as Miss Temple Barholm for many
a year the duke said when Miss Alicia was called from the room and
left them together

Aint she great was Tembaroms reply Shes just great

Its an exquisite survival of type said the duke She belongs to my
time not yours he added realizing that survival of type might not
clearly convey itself

Well she belongs to mine now answered Tembarom I wouldnt lose her
for a farm

The voice the phrases the carriage might survivethey do in
remote neighborhoods I supposebut the dress is quite delightfully
incredible It is a work of art the duke went on She had seemed too
good to be true Her clothes however had certainly not been dug out of
a wardrobe of forty years ago

When I went to talk to the head woman in the shop in Bond Street I
fixed it with em hard and fast that she was not to spoil her They were
to keep her like she was Shes like her little cap you know and her
little mantles and tippets Shes like them exclaimed Tembarom

Did he see that What an odd feature in a man of his sort And how
thoroughly New Yorkish it was that he should march into a fashionable
shop and see that he got what he wanted and the worth of his money
There had been no rashness in the hope that the unexplored treasure
might be a rich one The mans simplicity was an actual complexity He
had a boyish eye and a grin but there was a businesslike line about
his mouth which was strong enough to have been hard if it had not been
goodnatured

That was confoundedly clever of you his grace commented
heartilyconfoundedly I should never have had the wit to think of it
myself or the courage to do it if I had Shopwomen make me shy

Oh well I just put it up to them Tembarom answered easily

I believe cautiously translated the duke that you mean that you
made them feel that they alone were responsible

Yes I do assented Tembarom the grin slightly in evidence Put it
up to thems the short way of saying it

Would you mind my writing that down said the duke I have a fad for
dialects and new phrases He hastily scribbled the words in a tablet
that he took from his pocket Do you like living in England he asked
in course of time

I should like it if Id been born here was the answer

I see I see

If it had not been for finding Miss Alicia and that I made a promise
Id stay for a year anyhow Id have broken loose at the end of the
first week and worked my passage back if I hadnt had enough in my
clothes to pay for it He laughed but it was not real laughter There
was a thing behind it The situation was more edifying than one could
have hoped I made a promise and Im going to stick it out he said

He was going to stick it out because he had promised to endure for a
year Temple Barholm and an income of seventy thousand pounds The duke
gazed at him as at a fond dream realized

Ive nothing to do Tembarom added

Neither have I replied the Duke of Stone

But youre used to it and Im not Im used to working steen hours
a day and dropping into bed as tired as a dog but ready to sleep like
one and get up rested

I used to play twenty hours a day once answered the duke but I
didnt get up rested Thats probably why I have gout and rheumatism
combined Tell me how you worked and I will tell you how I played

It was worth while taking this tone with him It had been worth while
taking it with the chestnutgathering peasants in the Apennines
sometimes even with a stonebreaker by an English roadside And this one
was of a type more unique and distinctive than any othera fellow who
with the blood of Saxon kings and Norman nobles in his veins had known
nothing but the street life of the crudest city in the world who spoke
a sort of argot who knew no parallels of the things which surrounded
him in the ancient home he had inherited and in which he stood apart a
sort of semisophisticated savage The duke applied himself with grace
and finished ability to drawing him out The questions he asked were
all seemingly those of a man of the world charmingly interested in the
superior knowledge of a foreigner of varied experience His method was
one which engaged the interest of Tembarom himself He did not know that
he was not only questioned but so to speak delicately crossexamined
and that before the end of the interview the Duke of Stone knew more of
him his past existence and present sentiments than even Miss Alicia
knew after their long and intimate evening talks The duke however had
the advantage of being a man and of cherishing vivid recollections of
the days of his youth which unlike as it had been to that of
Tembarom furnished a degree of solid foundation upon which go to build
conjecture

A young man of his age his grace reflected astutely has always just
fallen out of love is falling into it or desires vaguely to do so Ten
years later there would perhaps be blank spaces lean years during which
he was not in love at all but at his particular period there must be
a young woman somewhere I wonder if she is employed in one of the
department stores he spoke of and how soon he hopes to present her to
us His conversation has revealed so far to use his own rich simile
neither hide nor hair of her

On his own part he was as ready to answer questions as to ask them In
fact he led Tembarom on to asking

I will tell you how I played had been meant He made a human document
of the history he enlarged he brilliantly diverged he included he
made pictures and found Tembaroms point of view or lack of it gave
spice and humor to relations he had thought himself tired of To tell
familiar anecdotes of courts and kings to a man who had never quite
believed that such things were realities who almost found them humorous
when they were casually spoken of was edification indeed The novel
charm lay in the fact that his class in his country did not include them
as possibilities Peasants in other countries plowmen shopkeepers
laborers in Englandall these at least they knew of and counted them
in as factors in the lives of the rich and great but this dear young
man

Whats a crown like Id like to see one How much do you guess such a
thing would costin dollars

Did not Miss Temple Barholm take you to see the regalia in the Tower
of London I am quite shocked said the duke He was in fact a trifle
disappointed With the puce dress and undersleeves and little fringes
she ought certainly to have rushed with her pupil to that seat of
historical instruction on their first morning in London immediately
after breakfasting on toast and bacon and marmalade and eggs

She meant me to go but somehow it was put off She almost cried on our
journey home when she suddenly remembered that wed forgotten it after
all

I am sure she said it was a wasted opportunity suggested his grace

Yes that was what hit her so hard Shed never been to London before
and you couldnt make her believe she could ever get there again and
she said it was ungrateful to Providence to waste an opportunity Shes
always mighty anxious to be grateful to Providence bless her

She regards you as Providence remarked the duke enraptured With a
touch here and there the touch of a master he had gathered the
whole little story of Miss Alicia and had found it of a whimsical
exquisiteness and humor

Shes a lot too good to me answered Tembarom I guess women as nice
as her are always a lot too good to men Shes a kind of little old
angel What makes me mad is to think of the fellows that didnt get busy
and marry her thirtyfive years ago

Were thereermany of em the duke inquired

Thousands of em though most of em never saw her I suppose you never
saw her then If you had you might have done it

The duke sitting with an elbow on each arm of his chair put the tips
of his fine gouty fingers together and smiled with a farreaching
inclusion of possibilities

So I might he said so I might My loss entirelymy abominable
loss

They had reached this point of the argument when the carriage from Stone
Hover arrived It was a stately barouche the coachman and footman of
which equally with its big horses seemed to have hastened to an extent
which suggested almost panting breathlessness It contained Lady Edith
and Lady Celia both pale and greatly agitated by the news which had
brought them horrified from Stone Hover without a moments delay

They both ascended in haste and swept in such alarmed anxiety up the
terrace steps and through the hall to their fathers side that they had
barely a polite gasp for Miss Alicia and scarcely saw Tembarom at all

Dear Papa they cried when he revealed himself in his chair in the
library intact and smiling How wicked of you dear How you have
frightened us

I begged you to be good dearest said Lady Edith almost in tears
Where was George You must dismiss him at once Reallyreally

He was half a mile away obeying my orders said the duke A groom
cannot be dismissed for obeying orders It is the pony who must be
dismissed to my great regret or else we must overfeed him until he is
even fatter than he is and cannot run away

Were his arms and legs and his ribs and collarbones and head quite
right Was he sure that he had not received any internal injury when he
fell out of the ponycarriage They could scarcely be convinced and
as they hung over and stroked and patted him Tembarom stood aside and
watched them with interest They were the girls he had to please Ann by
getting next to giving himself a chance to fall in love with them
so that shed know whether they were his kind or not They were
nicelooking and had a way of speaking that sounded rather swell but
they werent ace high to a little slim redheaded thing that looked at
you like a baby and pulled your heart up into your throat

Dont poke me any more dear children I am quite quite sound he
heard the duke say In Mr Temple Barholm you behold the preserver
of your parent Filial piety is making you behave with shocking
ingratitude

They turned to Tembarom at once with a pretty outburst of apologies
and thanks Lady Celia wasnt it is true a looker with her narrow
shoulders and rather long nose but she had an air of breeding and the
charming color of which Palliser had spoken returning to Lady Ediths
cheeks illuminated her greatly

They both were very polite and made many agreeably grateful speeches
but in the eyes of both there lurked a shade of anxiety which they hoped
to be able to conceal Their father watched them with a wicked pleasure
He realized clearly their wellbehaved desire to do and say exactly the
right thing and bear themselves in exactly the right manner and also
their awful uncertainty before an entirely unknown quantity Almost any
other kind of young man suddenly uplifted by strange fortune they might
have known some parallel for but a newsboy of New York All the New
Yorkers they had met or heard of had been so rich and grand as to make
them feel themselves by contrast mere country paupers quite shivering
with poverty and huddling for protection in their barely clean rags
so what was there to go on But how dreadful not to be quite right
precisely right in ones approachquite familiar enough and yet not
a shade too familiar which of course would appear condescending And be
it said the delicacy of the situation was added to by the fact that they
had heard something of Captain Pallisers extraordinary little story
about his determination to know ladies Really if Willocks the
butchers boy had inherited Temple Barholm it would have been easier to
know where one stood in the matter of being civil and agreeable to
him First Lady Edith made perhaps bold by the suggestion of physical
advantage bestowed by the color talked to him to the very best of her
ability and when she felt herself fearfully flagging Lady Celia took
him up and did her very wellconducted best Neither she nor her sister
were brilliant talkers at any time and limited by the absence of any
common familiar topic effort was necessary The neighborhood he did
not know London he was barely aware of social functions it would be an
impertinence to bring in games he did not play sport he had scarcely
heard of You were confined to America and if you knew next to nothing
of American life there you were

Tembarom saw it allhe was sharp enough for thatand his habit
of being jocular and wholly unashamed saved him from the misery of
awkwardness that Willocks would have been sure to have writhed under
His casual frankness however for a moment embarrassed Lady Edith to
the bitterest extremity When you are trying your utmost to make a queer
person oblivious to the fact that his world is one unknown to you it is
difficult to know where do you stand when he says

Its mighty hard to talk to a man who doesnt know a thing that belongs
to the kind of world youve spent your life in aint it But dont you
mind me a minute Im glad to be talked to anyhow by people like you
When I dont catch on Ill just ask No man was ever electrocuted for
not knowing and thats just where I am I dont know and Im glad to
be told Now theres one thing Burrill said Your Ladyship to you I
heard him Ought I to say it er oughtnt I

Oh no she answered but somehow without distaste in the momentary
stare he had startled her into Burrill is

Hes a servant he aided encouragingly Well Ive never been a
butler but Ive been somebodys servant all my life and mighty glad of
the chance This is the first time Ive been out of a job

What nice teeth he had What a queer candid unresentful creature What
a good sort of smile And how odd that it was he who was putting her
more at her ease by the mere way in which he was saying this almost
alarming thing By the time he had ended it was not alarming at all
and she had caught her breath again

She was actually sorry when the door opened and Lady Joan Fayre came in
followed almost immediately by Lady Mallowe and Captain Palliser who
appeared to have just returned from a walk and heard the news

Lady Mallowe was most sympathetic Why not indeed The Duke of Stone
was a delightful cynical creature and Stone Hover was despite its
ducal poverty a desirable place to be invited to if you could manage
it Her ladyships method of fluttering was not like Miss Alicias
its character being wholly modern but she fluttered nevertheless
The duke who knew all about her received her amiabilities with
appreciative smiles but it was the splendidly handsome hungryeyed
young woman with the line between her black brows who engaged his
attention On the alert as he always was for a situation he detected
one at once when he saw his American address her She did not address
him and scarcely deigned a reply when he spoke to her When he spoke
to others she conducted herself as though he were not in the room so
obviously did she choose to ignore his existence Such a bearing toward
ones host had indeed the charm of being an interesting novelty And
what a beauty she was with her lovely ferocious eyes and the small
black head poised on the exquisite long throat which was on the verge
of becoming a trifle too thin Then as in a flash he recalled between
one breath and another the quite fiendish episode of poor Jem Temple
Barholmand she was the girl

Then he became almost excited in his interest He saw it all As he had
himself argued must be the case this poor fellow was in love But it
was not with a lady in the New York department stores it was with a
young woman who would evidently disdain to wipe her feet upon him How
thrilling As Lady Mallowe and Palliser and the others chattered he
watched him observing his manner He stood the handsome creatures
steadily persistent rudeness very well he made no effort to push into
the talk when she coolly held him out of it He waited without external
uneasiness or spasmodic smiles If he could do that despite the
inevitable fact that he must feel his position uncomfortable he was
possessed of fiber That alone would make him worth cultivating And if
there were persons who were to be made uncomfortable why not cut in and
circumvent the beauty somewhat and give her a trifle of unease It
was with the light and adroit touch of accustomedness to all orders of
little situations that his grace took the matter in hand with a shade
also of amiable malice He drew Tembarom adroitly into the center of
things he knew how to lead him to make easily the odd frank
remarks which were sufficiently novel to suggest that he was actually
entertaining He beautifully edged Lady Joan out of her position She
could not behave ill to him he was far too old he said to himself
leaving out the fact that a Duke of Stone is a too respectable personage
to be quite waved aside

Tembarom began to enjoy himself a little more Lady Celia and Lady Edith
began to enjoy themselves a little more also Lady Mallowe was filled
with admiring delight Captain Palliser took in the situation and asked
himself questions about it On her part Miss Alicia was restored to
the happiness any lack of appreciation of her dear boy touchingly
disturbed In circumstances such as these he appeared to the advantage
which in a brief period would surely reveal his wonderful qualities She
clung so to his wonderful qualities because in all the threevolumed
novels of her youth the hero debarred from early advantages and raised
by the turn of fortunes wheel to splendor was transformed at once into
a being of the highest accomplishments and the most polished breeding
and ended in the third volume a creature before whom emperors paled
And how more than charmingly cordial his graces manner was when he left
them

Tomorrow he said if my daughters do not discover that I have
injured some more than vital organ I shall call to proffer my thanks
with the most immense formality I shall get out of the carriage in
the manner customary in respectable neighborhoods not roll out at your
feet Afterward you will I hope come and dine with us I am devoured
by a desire to become more familiar with The Earth




CHAPTER XXV


It was Lady Mallowe who perceived the moment when he became the fashion
The Duke of Stone called with the immense formality he had described
and his visit was neither brief nor dull A little later Tembarom with
his guests dined at Stone Hover and the dinner was further removed from
dullness than any one of numerous past dinners always noted for being
the most agreeable the neighborhood afforded The duke managed his guest
as an impresario might have managed his tenor though this was done with
subtly concealed methods He had indeed a novelty to offer which had
been discussed with much uncertainty of point of view He presented it
to an only languidly entertained neighborhood as a trouvaille of his own
choice Here was drama here was atmosphere here was charm verging in
its character upon the occult You would not see it if you were not a
collector of such values

Nobody will be likely to see him as he is unless he is pointed out to
them was what he said to his daughters But being bored to deathwe
are all boredonce adroitly assisted to suspect him of being alluring
most of them will spring upon him and clasp him to their wearied
breasts I havent the least idea what will happen afterward I shall in
fact await the result with interest

Being told Pallisers story of the Ladies he listened holding the
tips of his fingers together and wearing an expression of deep interest
slightly baffled in its nature It was Lady Edith who related the
anecdote to him

Now he said it would be very curious and complicating if that were
true but I dont believe it is Palliser of course likes to tell a
good story I shall be able to discover in time whether it is true or
not but at present I dont believe it

Following the dinner party at Stone Hover came many others All the
wellknown carriages began to roll up the avenue to Temple Barholm The
Temple Barholm carriages also began to roll down the avenue and between
the stone griffins on their way to festive gatherings of varied order
Burrill and the footmen ventured to reconsider their early plans for
giving warning It wasnt so bad if the country was going to take him
up

Do you see what is happening Lady Mallowe said to Joan The man is
becoming actually popular

He is popular as a turn at a music hall is answered Joan He will be
dropped as he was taken up

Theres something about him they like and he represents what everybody
most wants For Gods sake Joan dont behave like a fool this time
The case is more desperate There is nothing elsenothing

There never was said Joan and I know the desperateness of the
case How long are you going to stay here

I am going to stay for some time They are not conventional people It
can be managed very well We are relatives

Will you stay inquired Joan in a low voice until they ask you to
remove yourself

Lady Mallowe smiled an agreeably subtle smile

Not quite that she answered Miss Alicia would never have the
courage to suggest it It takes courage and sophistication to do that
sort of thing Mr Temple Barholm evidently wants us to remain He will
be willing to make as much of the relationship as we choose to let him

Do you choose to let him make as much of it as will establish us here
for weeksor months Joan asked her low voice shaking a little

That will depend entirely upon circumstances It will in fact depend
entirely upon you said Lady Mallowe her lips setting themselves into
a straight thin line

For an appreciable moment Joan was silent but after it she lost her
head and whirled about

I shall go away she cried

Where asked Lady Mallowe

Back to London

How much money have you asked her mother She knew she had none She
was always sufficiently shrewd to see that she had none If the girl had
had a pound a week of her own her mother had always realized that she
would have been unmanageable After the Jem Temple Barholm affair she
would have been capable of going to live alone in slums As it was
she knew enough to be aware that she was too handsome to walk out into
Piccadilly without a penny in her pocket so it had been just possible
to keep her indoors

How much money have you she repeated quietly This was the way in
which their unbearable scenes beganthe scenes which the servants
passing the doors paused to listen to in the hope that her ladyship
would forget that raised voices may be heard by the discreet outsider

How much money have you she said again

Joan looked at her this time it was for about five seconds She turned
her back on her and walked out of the room Shortly afterward Lady
Mallowe saw her walking down the avenue in the rain which was beginning
to fall

She had left the house because she dared not stay in it Once out in
the park she folded her long purple cloak about her and pulled her soft
purple felt hat down over her brows walking swiftly under the big trees
without knowing where she intended to go before she returned She liked
the rain she liked the heavy clouds she wore her dark purples because
she felt a fantastic secret comfort in calling them her mourningher
mourning which she would wear forevermore

No one could know so well as herself how desperate from her own point of
view the case was She had long known that her mother would not hesitate
for a moment before any chance of a second marriage which would totally
exclude her daughter from her existence Why should she after all Joan
thought They had always been antagonists The moment of chance had been
looming on the horizon for months Sir Moses Monaldini had hovered
about fitfully and evidently doubtfully at first more certainly and
frequently of late but always with a clearly objecting eye cast askance
upon herself With determination and desire to establish a social
certainty astute enough not to care specially for young beauty and
exactions he did not purpose to submit to and keen enough to see the
advantage of a handsome woman with bitter reason to value what was
offered to her in the form of a luxurious future Sir Moses was moving
toward action though with proper caution He would have no penniless
daughters hanging about scowling and sneering None of that for him And
the ripest apple upon the topmost bow in the highest wind would not drop
more readily to his feet than her mother would Joan knew with sharp and
shamed burnings

As the rain fell she walked in her purple cloak unpaid for and her
purple hat for which they had been dunned with threatening insults and
knew that she did not own and could not earn a penny She could not dig
and to beg she was ashamed and all the more horribly because she had
been a beggar of the meaner order all her life It made her sick to
think of the perpetual visits they had made where they were not wanted
of the times when they had been politely bundled out of places of the
methods which had been used to induce shopkeepers to let them run up
bills For years her mother and she had been walking advertisements of
smart shops because both were handsome wore clothes well and carried
them where they would be seen and talked about Now this would be all
over since it had been Lady Mallowe who had managed all details Thrown
upon her own resources Joan would have none of them even though she
must walk in rags Her education had prepared her for only one thingto
marry well if luck were on her side It had never been on her side If
she had never met Jem she would have married somebody since that would
have been better than the inevitable last slide into an aging life spent
in cheap lodgings with her mother But Jem had been the beginning and
the end

She bit her lips as she walked and suddenly tears swept down her cheeks
and dripped on to the purple cloth folded over her breast

And he sits in Jems place And every day that common foolish stare
will follow me she said

He sat it was true in the place Jem Temple Barholm would have occupied
if he had been a living man and he looked at her a good deal Perhaps
he sometimes unconsciously stared because she made him think of many
things But if she had been in a state of mind admitting of judicial
fairness she would have been obliged to own that it was not quite a
foolish stare Absorbed abstracted perhaps but it was not foolish
Sometimes on the contrary it was searching and keen

Of course he was doing his best to please her Of all the Ladies it
seemed evident that he was most attracted by her He tried to talk to
her despite her unending rebuffs he followed her about and endeavored
to interest her he presented a hidebound unsensitiveness when she did
her worst Perhaps he did not even know that she was being icily rude
He was plainly making up to her after the manner of his class He
was perhaps playing the part of the patient adorer who melted by noble
longsuffering in novels distinguished by heroes of humble origin

She had reached the village when the rain changed its mind and without
warning began to pour down as if the black cloud passing overhead had
suddenly opened She was wondering if she would not turn in somewhere
for shelter until the worst was over when a door opened and Tembarom ran
out with an umbrella

Come in to the Hibblethwaites cottage Lady Joan he said This will
be over directly

He did not affectionately hustle her in by the arm as he would have
hustled in Miss Alicia but he closely guarded her with the umbrella
until he guided her inside

Thank you she said

The first object she became aware of was a thin face with pointed chin
and ferret eyes peering at her round the end of a sofa then a sharp
voice

Tak off her cloak an shake th rain off it in th wash us it
said Mother an Aunt Susans out Let him unbutton it fer thee

I can unbutton it myself thank you said Lady Joan Tembarom took it
when she had unbuttoned it He took it from her shoulders before she had
time to stop him Then he walked into the tiny wash us and shook it
thoroughly He came back and hung it on a chair before the fire

Tummas was leaning back in his pillows and gazing at her

I know tha name he said He towd me with a jerk of the head toward
Tembarom

Did he replied Lady Joan without interest

A flaringly illustrated New York paper was spread out upon his sofa He
pushed it aside and pulled the shabby atlas toward him It fell open at
a map of North America as if through long habit

Sit thee down he ordered

Tembarom had stood watching them both

I guess youd better not do that he suggested to Tummas

Why not said the boy sharply Shes th wench he was goin to
marry Its th same as if hed married her If she wur his widder
shed want to talk about him Widders allus wants to talk Why shouldnt
she Womens women Hed ha wanted to talk about her

Who is he asked Joan with stiff lips

The Temple Barholm as d be here if he was na

Joan turned to Tembarom

Do you come here to talk to this boy about HIM she said How dare
you

Tummass eyes snapped his voice snapped also

He knew next to nowt about him till I towd him he said Then he came
to ax me things an foind out more He knows as much as I do now Us
sits here an talks him over

Lady Joan still addressed Tembarom

What interest can you have in the man who ought to be in your place
she asked What possible interest

Well he answered awkwardly because he ought to be I suppose Aint
that reason enough

He had never had to deal with women who hated him and who were angry and
he did not know exactly what to say He had known very few women and
he had always been goodnatured with them and won their liking in some
measure Also there was in his attitude toward this particular woman
a baffled feeling that he could not make her understand him She would
always think of him as an enemy and believe he meant things he did not
mean If he had been born and educated in her world he could have used
her own language but he could use only his own and there were so many
things he must not say for a time at least

Do you not realize she said that you are presuming upon your
positionthat you and this boy are taking liberties

Tummas broke in wholly without compunction

Ive taken liberties aw my loife he stated an Im goin to tak
em till I dee Theyre th ony things I can tak lyin here crippled
an Im goin to tak em

Stop that Tummas said Tembarom with friendly authority She
doesnt catch on and you dont catch on either Youre both of you
way off Stop it

I thought happen she could tell me things I didnt know protested
Tummas throwing himself back on his pillows If she conna she conna
an if she wunnot she wunnot Get out wi thee he said to Joan I
dunnot want thee about th place

Say said Tembarom shut up

I am going said Lady Joan and turned to open the door

The rain was descending in torrents but she passed swiftly out into its
deluge walking as rapidly as she could She thought she cared nothing
about the rain but it dashed in her face and eyes taking her breath
away and she had need of breath when her heart was beating with such
fierceness

If she wur his widder the boy had said

Even chance could not let her alone at one of her worst moments She
walked faster and faster because she was afraid Tembarom would follow
her and in a few minutes she heard him splashing behind her and then
he was at her side holding the umbrella over her head

Youre a good walker he said but Im a sprinter I trained running
after street cars and catching the L in New York

She had so restrained her miserable hysteric impulse to break down and
utterly humiliate herself under the unexpected blow of the episode in
the cottage that she had had no breath to spare when she left the room
and her hurried effort to escape had left her so much less that she did
not speak

Ill tell you something he went on Hes a little freak but you
cant blame him much Dont be mad at him Hes never moved from that
corner since he was born I guess and hes got nothing to do or to
think of but just hearing whats happening outside Hes sort of crazy
curious and when he gets hold of a thing that suits him he just holds
on to it till the last bell rings

She said nothing whatever and he paused a moment because he wanted to
think over the best way to say the next thing

Mr James Temple Barholm he ventured it with more delicacy of
desire not to seem to take liberties than she would have credited him
withsaw his mother sitting with him in her arms at the cottage door
a week or so after he was born He stopped at the gate and talked to
her about him and he left him a sovereign Hes got it now It seems
a fortune to him Hes made a sort of idol of him Thats why he talks
like he does I wouldnt let it make me mad if I were you

He did not know that she could not have answered him if she would that
she felt that if he did not stop she might fling herself down upon the
wet heather and wail aloud

You dont like me he began after they had walked a few steps farther
You dont like me

This was actually better It choked back the sobs rising in her throat
The stupid shock of it his tasteless foolishness helped her by its
very folly to a sort of defense against the disastrous wave of emotion
she might not have been able to control She gathered herself together

It must be an unusual experience she answered

Well it issort of he said but in a manner curiously free from
fatuous swagger Ive had luck that way I guess its been because Id
GOT to make friends so as I could earn a living It seems sort of queer
to know that some ones got a grouch against me thatthat I cant get
away with

She looked up the avenue to see how much farther they must walk
together since she was not a sprinter and could not get away from
him She thought she caught a glimpse through the trees of a dogcart
driven by a groom and hoped she had not mistaken and that it was
driving in their direction

It must indeed she said though I am not sure I quite understand
what a grouch is

When youve got a grouch against a fellow he explained impersonally
you want to get at him You want to make him feel like a mutt and a
mutts the worst kind of a fool Youve got one against me

She looked before her between narrowed lids and faintly smiledthe
most disagreeable smile she was capable of And yet for some too
extraordinary reason he went on But she had seen men go on before this
when all the odds were against them Sometimes their madness took them
this way

I knew there was a lot against me when I came here he persisted I
should have been a fool if I hadnt I knew when you came that I was up
against a pretty hard proposition but I thought perhaps if I got busy
and SHOWED youyouve got to SHOW a person

Showed me what she asked contemptuously

Showed youwellme he tried to explain

You

And that I wanted to be friends he added candidly

Was the man mad Did he realize nothing Was he too thick of skin even
to see

Friends You and I The words ought to have scorched him pachyderm
though he was

I thought youd give me a chancea sort of chance

She stopped short on the avenue

You did

She had not been mistaken The dogcart had rounded the faroff curve
and was coming toward them And the man went on talking

Youve felt every minute that I was in a place that didnt belong to
me You know that if the man that it did belong to was here youd be
here with him You felt as if Id robbed him of itand Id robbed you
It was your homeyours You hated me too much to think of anything
else Supposesuppose there was a way I could give it back to youmake
it your home again

His voice dropped and was rather unsteady The fool the gross brutal
vulgar hopeless fool He thought this was the way to approach her to
lead her to listen to his proposal of marriage Not for a second did she
guess that they were talking at cross purposes She did not know that as
he kept himself steady under her contemptuousness he was thinking that
Ann would have to own that he had been up against it hard and plenty
while the thing was going on

Im always up against it when Im talking to you he said You get
me rattled Theres things I want to talk about and ask you Suppose you
give me a chance and let us start out by being sort of friends

I am staying in your house she answered in a deadly voice and I
cannot go away because my mother will not let me You can force yourself
upon me if you choose because I cannot help it but understand once
for all that I will not give you your ridiculous chance And I will not
utter one word to you when I can avoid it

He was silent for a moment and seemed to be thinking rather deeply She
realized now that he saw the nearing dogcart

You wont Then its up to me he said Then with a change of tone he
added Ill stop the cart and tell the man to drive you to the house
Im not going to force myself on you as you call it Itd be no use
Perhaps itll come all right in the end


He made a sign to the groom who hastened his horses pace and drew up
when he reached them

Take this lady back to the house he said

The groom who was a new arrival began to prepare to get down and give
up his place

You neednt do that said Tembarom

Wont you get up and take the reins sir the man asked uncertainly

No I cant drive Youll have to do it Ill walk

And to the grooms amazement they left him standing under the trees
looking after them

Its up to me he was saying The whole durned things up to me




CHAPTER XXVI


The neighborhood of Temple Barholm was not upon the whole a brilliant
one Indeed it had been frankly designated by the casual guest as dull
The country was beautiful enough and several rather large estates lay
within reach of one another but their owners were neither very rich nor
especially notable personages They were of extremely good old blood
and were of established respectability None of them however was given
to entertaining house parties made up of the smart and dazzlingly sinful
world of fashion said by moralists to be composed entirely of young and
mature beauties male and female capable of supplying at any moment
enlivening detail for the divorce courtglittering beings whose
wardrobes were astonishing and whose conversations were composed wholly
of brilliant paradox and sparkling repartee

Most of the residents took their sober season in London the men of the
family returning gladly to their pheasants the women not regretfully to
their gardens and tennis because their successes in town had not been
particularly delirious The guests who came to them were generally
as respectable and lawabiding as themselves and introduced no
iconoclastic diversions For the greater portion of the year in fact
diners out were of the neighborhood and met the neighborhood and were
reduced to discussing neighborhood topics which was not on the whole
a fevered joy The Duke of Stone was perhaps the one man who might
have furnished topics Privately it was believed and in part known
that he at least had had a brilliant if not wholly unreprehensible
past He might have introduced enlivening elements from London even
from Paris Vienna Berlin and Rome but the sobering influence of
years of rheumatic gout and a not entirely sufficing income prevented
activities and his opinions of his social surroundings were vaguely
guessed to be those of a not too lenient critic

I do not know anything technical or scientific about ditchwater he
had expressed himself in the bosom of his family I never analyzed it
but analyzers I gather consider it dull If anything could be duller
than ditchwater I should say it was Stone Hover and its surrounding
neighborhood He had also remarked at another time If our society
could be enriched by some of the characters who form the house parties
and seem in fact integral parts of all country society in modern
problem or even unproblem novels how happy one might be how edified
and amused A wicked lady or so of high or extremely low rank of
immense beauty and corruscating brilliancy a lovely creature male or
female whom she is bent upon undoing

Dear papa protested Lady Celia

Reproach me dearest Reproach me as severely as you please It
inspires me It makes me feel like a wicked dangerous man and I have
not felt like one for many years Such persons as I describe form the
charm of existence I assure you A ruthless adventuress with any kind
of good looks would be the making of us Several of them of different
types a handsome villain and a few victims unknowing of their fate
would cause life to flow by like a peaceful stream

Lady Edith laughed an unseemly little laughunseemly since filial
regret at paternal obliquity should have restrained it

Papa you are quite horrible she said You ought not to make your
few daughters laugh at improper things

I would make my daughters laugh at anything so long as I must doom them
to Stone Hoverand Lady Pevensy and Mrs Stoughton and the rector if
one may mention names he answered To see you laugh revives me by
reminding me that once I was considered a witty personquite so Some
centuries ago however about the time when things were being rebuilt
after the flood

In such circumstances it cannot be found amazing that a situation such
as Temple Barholm presented should provide rich food for conversation
supposition argument and humorous comment

T Tembarom himself after the duke had established him furnished an
unlimited source of interest His household became a perennial fount of
quiet discussion Lady Mallowe and her daughter were the members of it
who met with the most attention They appeared to have become members of
it rather than visitors Her ladyship had plainly elected to extend her
stay even beyond the period to which a fond relative might feel entitled
to hospitality She had been known to extend visits before with great
cleverness but this one assumed an established aspect She was not
going away the neighborhood decided until she had achieved that which
she had come to accomplish The present unconventional atmosphere of the
place naturally supported her And how probable it seemed taking into
consideration Captain Pallisers story that Mr Temple Barholm wished
her to stay Lady Joan would be obliged to stay also if her mother
intended that she should But the poor Americanthere were some
expressions of sympathy though the situation was greatly added to by
the featurethe poor American was being treated by Lady Joan as only
she could treat a man It was worth inviting the whole party to dinner
or tea or lunch merely to see the two together The manner in which
she managed to ignore him and be scathing to him without apparently
infringing a law of civility and the number of laws she sometimes chose
to sweep aside when it was her mood to do so were extraordinary If
she had not been a beauty with a sort of mystic charm for the male
creature surely he would have broken his chains But he did not What
was he going to do in the end What was she going to do What was
Lady Mallowe going to do if there was no end at all He was not as
unhappylooking a lover as one might have expected they said He
kept up his spirits wonderfully Perhaps she was not always as icily
indifferent to him as she chose to appear in public Temple Barholm was
a great estate and Sir Moses Monaldini had been mentioned by rumor Of
course there would be something rather strange and tragic in it if she
came to Temple Barholm as its mistress in such singular circumstances
But he certainly did not look depressed or discouraged So they talked
it over as they looked on

How they gossip How delightfully they gossip said the duke But it
is such a perfect subject They have never been so enthralled before
Dear young man how grateful we ought to be for him

One of the most discussed features of the case was the dukes own
cultivation of the central figure There was an actual oddity about
it He drove from Stone Hover to Temple Barholm repeatedly He invited
Tembarom to the castle and had long talks with himlong comfortable
talks in secluded delightful rooms or under great trees on a lawn
He wanted to hear anecdotes of his past to draw him on to giving his
points of view When he spoke of him to his daughters he called him T
Tembarom but the slight derision of his earlier tone modified itself

That delightful young man will shortly become my closest intimate he
said He not only keeps up my spirits but he opens up vistas Vistas
after a mans seventysecond birthday At times I could clasp him to my
breast

I like him first rate Tembarom said to Miss Alicia I liked him the
minute he got up laughing like an old sport when he fell out of the pony
carriage

As he became more intimate with him he liked him still better Obscured
though it was by airy elderly persiflage he began to come upon a
background of stability and points of view wholly to be relied on in
his new acquaintance It had evolved itself out of long and varied
experience with the aid of brilliant mentality The old peers reasons
were always logical He laughed at most things but at a few he did not
laugh at all After several of the long conversations Tembarom began
to say to himself that this seemed like a man you need not be afraid to
talk things over withthings you didnt want to speak of to everybody

Seems to me he said thoughtfully to Miss Alicia hes an old fellow
you could tie to Ive got on to one thing when Ive listened to him he
talks all he wants to and laughs a lot but he never gives himself away
He wouldnt give another fellow away either if he said he wouldnt He
knows how not to

There was an afternoon on which during a drive they took together the
duke was enlightened as to several points which had given him cause for
reflection among others the story beloved of Captain Palliser and his
audiences

I guess youve known a good many women T Tembarom remarked on this
occasion after a few minutes of thought Living all over the world as
youve done youd be likely to come across a whole raft of them one
time and another

A whole raft of them one time and another agreed the duke Yes

Youve liked them havent you

Immensely Sometimes a trifle disastrously Find me a more absolutely
interesting object in the universe than a womanany womanand I will
devote the remainder of my declining years to the study of it answered
his grace

He said it with a decision which made T Tembarom turn to look at him
and after his look decide to proceed

Have you ever known a bit of a slim thinghe made an odd embracing
gesture with his armthe size that you could pick up with one hand
and set on your knee as if she was a childthe duke remained still
knowing this was only the beginning and pricking up his ears as he took
a rapid kaleidoscopic view of all the Ladies in the neighborhood and
as hastily waved them asidea bit of a thing that some way seems to
mean it all to youand moves the world The conclusion was one which
brought the incongruous touch of maturity into his face

Not one of the Ladies the duke was mentally summing the matter up
Certainly not Lady Joan after all Not I think even the young person
in the department store

He leaned back in his corner the better to inspect his companion
directly

You have I see he replied quietly Once I myself did He had
cried out Ah Heloise though he had laughed at himself when he
seemed facing his ridiculous tragedy

Yes confessed T Tembarom I met her at the boardinghouse where I
lived Her father was a Lancashire man and an inventor I guess youve
heard of him his name is Joseph Hutchinson

The whole country had heard of him more countries indeed than one
had heard He was the man who was going to make his fortune in America
because T Tembarom had stood by him in his extremity He would make a
fortune in America and another in England and possibly several others
on the Continent He had learned to read in the village school and the
girl was his daughter

Yes replied the duke

I dont know whether the one you knew had that quiet little way of
seeing right straight into a thing and making you see it too said
Tembarom

She had answered the duke and an odd expression wavered in his
eyes because he was looking backward across forty years which seemed a
hundred

Thats what I meant by moving the world T Tembarom went on You
know shes RIGHT and youve got to do what she says if you love her

And you always do said the dukealways and forever There are very
few They are the elect

T Tembarom took it gravely

I said to her once that there wasnt more than one of her in the world
because there couldnt be enough to make two of that kind I wasnt
joshing either I meant it Its her quiet little voice and her quiet
babyfied eyes that get you where you cant move And its something
else you dont know anything about Its her never doing anything for
herself but just doing it because its the right thing for you

The dukes chin had sunk a little on his breast and looking back across
the hundred years he forgot for a moment where he was The one he
remembered had been another mans wife a little angel brought up in a
convent by whitesouled nuns passed over by her people to an elderly
vaurien of great magnificence and she had sent the strong laughing
impassioned young English peer away before it was too late and with
the young young eyes of her looking upward at him in that way which saw
straight into a thing and with that quiet little voice So long ago
So long ago

Ah Heloise he sighed unconsciously

What did you say asked T Tembarom The duke came back

I was thinking of the time when I was nine and twenty he answered
It was not yesterday nor even the day before The one I knew died when
she was twentyfour

Died said Tembarom Good Lord He dropped his head and even changed
color A fellow cant get on to a thing like that It seems as if it
couldnt happen Suppose he caught his breath hard and then pulled
himself upNothing could happen to her before she knew that Ive
proved what I saidjust proved it and done every single thing she told
me to do

I am sure you have the duke said

Its because of that I began to say this Tembarom spoke hurriedly
that he might thrust away the sudden dark thought Youre a man and
Im a man far away ahead of me as you are youre a man too I was
crazy to get her to marry me and come here with me and she wouldnt

The dukes eyes lighted anew

She had her reasons he said

She laid em out as if shed been my mother instead of a little
redheaded angel that you wanted to snatch up and crush up to you so she
couldnt breathe She didnt waste a word She just told me what I was
up against Shed lived in the village with her grandmother and she
knew She said Id got to come and find out for myself what no one else
could teach me She told me about the kind of girls Id seebeauties
that were different from anything Id ever seen before And it was up to
me to see all of themthe best of them

Ladies interjected the duke gently

Yes With titles like those in novels she said and clothes like those
in the Ladies Pictorial The kind of girls she said that would make
her look like a housemaid Housemaid be darned he exclaimed suddenly
growing hot Ive seen the whole lot of them Ive done my darndest to
get next and theres not one he stopped short Why should any of
them look at me anyhow he added suddenly

That was not her point remarked the duke She wanted you to look
at them and you have looked T Tembaroms eagerness was inspiring to
behold

I have havent I he cried That was what I wanted to ask you Ive
done as she said I havent shirked a thing Ive followed them around
when I knew they hadnt any use on earth for me Some of them have
handed me the lemon pretty straight Why shouldnt they But I dont
believe she knew how tough it might be for a fellow sometimes

No she did not the duke said Also she probably did not know that
in ancient days of chivalry ladies sent forth their knights to bear
buffeting for their sakes in proof of fealty Rise up Sir Knight This
last phrase of course T Tembarom did not know the poetic significance
of

To his hearer Pallisers story became an amusing thing read in the
light of this most delicious frankness It was Palliser himself who
played the fool and not T Tembarom who had simply known what he
wanted and had with businesslike directness applied himself to
finding a method of obtaining it The young women he gave his time to
must be Ladies because Miss Hutchinson had required it from him The
female flower of the noble houses had been passed in review before
him to practise upon so to speak The handsomer they were the more
dangerously charming the better Miss Hutchinson would be pleased And
he had been regarded as a presumptuous aspirant It was a situation for
a comedy But the Ladies would not enjoy it if they were told It was
also not the Duke of Stone who would tell them They could not in
the least understand the subtlety of the comedy in which they had
unconsciously taken part Ann Hutchinsons grandmother curtsied to them
in her stiff old way when they passed Ann Hutchinson had gone to the
village school and been presented with prizes for needlework and good
behavior But what a girl she must be the slim bit of a thing with a
red head What a clearheaded and firm little person

In courts he had learned to wear a composed countenance when he was
prompted to smile and he wore one now He enjoyed the society of T
Tembarom increasingly every hour He provided him with every joy

Their drive was a long one and they talked a good deal They talked of
the Hutchinsons of the invention of the business deals Tembarom
had entered into at the outset and of their tremendously encouraging
result It was not mere rumor that Hutchinson would end by being a rich
man The girl would be an heiress How complex her position would be
And being of the elect who unknowingly bear with them the power
that moves the world how would she affect Temple Barholm and its
surrounding neighborhood

I wish to God she was here now exclaimed Tembarom suddenly

It had been an interesting talk but now and then the duke had wondered
if as it went on his companion was as wholly at his ease as was usual
with him An occasional shade of absorption in his expression as if
he were thinking of two things at once despite himself a hint of
restlessness revealed themselves occasionally Was there something more
he was speculating on the possibility of saying something more to tell
or explain If there was let him take his time His audience at all
events was possessed of perceptions This somewhat abrupt exclamation
might open the way

That is easily understood my dear fellow replied the duke

Theres times when you want a little thing like that just to talk
things over with just to ask because youyoure dead sure shed never
lose her head and give herself away without knowing she was doing
it She could just keep still and let the waves roll over her and
be standing there ready and quiet when the tide had passed Its the
keeping your mouth shut thats so hard for most people the not saying a
darned thing whatever happens till just the right time

Women cannot often do it said the duke Very few men can

Youre right Tembarom answered and there was a trifle of anxiety in
his tone

Theres women just the best kind that you darent tell a big thing
to Not that theyd mean to give it awayperhaps they wouldnt know
when they did itbut theyd feel so anxious theyd gettheyd get

Rattled put in the duke and knew who he was thinking of He saw Miss
Alicias delicate timid face as he spoke

T Tembarom laughed

Thats just it he answered They wouldnt go back on you for worlds
butwell you have to be careful with them

Hes got something on his mind mentally commented the duke He
wonders if he will tell it to me

And theres times when youd give half youve got to be able to talk a
thing out and put it up to some one else for a while I could do it with
her Thats why I said I wish to God that she was here

You have learned to know how to keep still the duke said So have I
We learned it in different schools but we have both learned

As he was saying the words he thought he was going to hear something
when he had finished saying them he knew that he would without a doubt
T Tembarom made a quick move in his seat he lost a shade of color and
cleared his throat as he bent forward casting a glance at the backs of
the coachman and footman on the high seat above them

Can those fellows hear me he asked

No the duke answered if you speak as you are speaking now

You are the biggest man about here the young man went on You stand
for everything that English people care for and you were born knowing
all the things I dont Ive been carrying a big load for quite a while
and I guess Im not big enough to handle it alone perhaps Anyhow I
want to be sure Im not making fool mistakes The worst of it is that
Ive got to keep still if Im right and Ive got to keep still if Im
wrong Ive got to keep still anyhow

I learned to hold my tongue in places where if I had not held it I
might have plunged nations into bloodshed the duke said Tell me all
you choose

As a result of which by the time their drive had ended and they
returned to Stone Hover he had told him and the duke sat in his
corner of the carriage with an unusual light in his eyes and a flush of
somewhat excited color on his cheek

Youre a queer fellow T Tembarom he said when they parted in the
drawingroom after taking tea You exhilarate me You make me laugh If
I were an emotional person you would at moments make me cry Theres an
affecting uprightness about you Youre rather a fine fellow too pon
my life Putting a waxen goutknuckled old hand on his shoulder and
giving him a friendly push which was half a pat he added You are by
God



And after his guest had left him the duke stood for some minutes gazing
into the fire with a complicated smile and the air of a man who finds
himself quaintly enriched

I have had ambitions in the course of my existenceseveral of them
he said but even in overvaulting moments never have I aspired to such
an altitude as thisto be as it were part of a melodrama One feels
that one scarcely deserves it




CHAPTER XXVII


Mr Temple Barholm seems in better spirits Lady Mallowe said to
Captain Palliser as they walked on the terrace in the starlight dusk
after dinner

Captain Palliser took his cigar from his mouth and looked at the glowing
end of it

Has it struck you that he has been in low spirits he inquired
speculatively One does not usually connect him with depression

Certainly not with depression Hes an extraordinary creature
One would think he would perish from lack of the air he is used to
breathingNew York air

He is not perishing Hes too shrewd returned Palliser He maynt
exactly like all this but hes getting something out of it

He is not getting much of what he evidently wants most I am out of all
patience said Lady Mallowe

Her acquaintance with Palliser had lasted through a number of years
They argued most matters from the same basis of reasoning They were at
times almost candid with each other It may be acknowledged however
that of the two Lady Mallowe was the more inclined to verge on
selfrevelation This was of course because she was the less clever and
had more temper Her temper she had now and then owned bitterly to
herself had played her tricks Captain Pallisers temper never did
this It was Lady Mallowes temper which spoke now but she did not
in the least mind his knowing that Joan was exasperating her beyond
endurance He knew the whole situation well enough to be aware of it
without speech on her part He had watched similar situations several
times before

Her manner toward him is to resort to New York colloquialisms the
limit Palliser said quietly Is it your idea that his less good
spirits have been due to Lady Joans ingenuities They are ingenious
you know

They are devilish exclaimed her mother She treads him in the mire
and sails about professing to be conducting herself flawlessly She is
too clever for me she added with bitterness

Palliser laughed softly

But very often you have been too clever for her he suggested For my
part I dont quite see how you got her here

Lady Mallowe became not almost but entirely candid

Upon the whole I dont quite know myself I believe she really came
for some mysterious reason of her own

That is rather my impression said Palliser She has got something up
her sleeve and so has he

He Lady Mallowe quite ejaculated the word She always has Thats
her abominable secretive way But he T Tembarom with something up his
sleeve One cant imagine it

Almost everybody has I found that out long years ago said Palliser
looking at his cigar end again as if consulting it Since I arrived at
the conclusion I always take it for granted and look out for it Ive
become rather clever in following such things up and I have taken an
unusual interest in T Tembarom from the first

Lady Mallowe turned her handsome face much softened by an enwreathing
gauze scarf toward him anxiously

Do you think his depression or whatever it is means Joan she asked

If he is depressed by her you need not be discouraged smiled
Palliser The time to lose hope would be when despite her ingenuities
he became entirely cheerful But he added after a moment of pause I
have an idea there is some other little thing

Do you suppose that some young woman he has left behind in New York
is demanding her rights said Lady Mallowe with annoyance That
is exactly the kind of thing Joan would like to hear and so entirely
natural Some shopgirl or other

Quite natural as you say but he would scarcely be running up to
London and consulting Scotland Yard about her Palliser answered

Scotland Yard ejaculated his companion How in the world did you
find that out

Captain Palliser did not explain how he had done it Presumably his
knowledge was due to the adroitness of the system of following such
things up

Scotland Yard has also come to him he went on Did you chance to see
a redfaced person who spent a morning with him last week

He looked like a butcher and I thought he might be one of his
friends Lady Mallowe said

I recognized the man He is an extremely clever detective much
respected for his resources in the matter of following clues which are
so attenuated as to be scarcely clues at all

Clues have no connection with Joan said Lady Mallowe still more
annoyed All London knows her miserable story

Have you Captain Pallisers tone was thoughtful has any one ever
seen Mr Strangeways

No Can you imagine anything more absurdly romantic A creature without
a memory shut up in a remote wing of a palace like this as if he were
the Man with the Iron Mask Romance is not quite compatible with T
Tembarom

It is so incongruous that it has entertained me to think it over a good
deal remarked Palliser He leaves everything to ones imagination
All one knows is that he isnt a relative that he isnt mad but only
too nervous to see or be seen Queer situation Ive found there is
always a reason for things the queerer they are the more sure it is
that theres a reason What is the reason Strangeways is kept here and
where would a detective come in Just on general principles Im rather
going into the situation Theres a reason and it would be amusing to
find it out Dont you think so

He spoke casually and Lady Mallowes answer was casual though she knew
from experience that he was not as casual as he chose to seem He was
clever enough always to have certain reasons of his own which formulated
themselves into interests large and small He knew things about people
which were useful Sometimes quite small things were useful He was
always well behaved and no one had ever accused him of bringing
pressure to bear but it was often possible for him to sell things
or buy things or bring about things in circumstances which would have
presented difficulties to other people Lady Mallowe knew from long
experience all about the exigencies of cases when needs must and she
was not critical Temple Barholm as the estate of a distant relative
and T Tembarom as its owner were not assets to deal with indifferently
When a man made a respectable living out of people who could be
persuaded to let you make investments for them it was not an
unbusinesslike idea to be in the position to advise an individual
strongly

Its quite natural that you should feel an interest she answered
But the romantic stranger is too romantic though I will own Scotland
Yard is a little odd

Yes that is exactly what I thought said Palliser

He had in fact thought a good deal and followed the thing up in a quiet
amateur way though with annoyingly little result Occasionally he had
felt rather a fool for his pains because he had been led to so few
facts of importance and had found himself so often confronted by T
Tembaroms entirely frank grin His own mental attitude was not a
complex one Lady Mallowes summing up had been correct enough on the
whole Temple Barholm ought to be a substantial asset regarded in its
connection with its present owner Little dealings in stockssometimes
rather large ones when luck was with himhad brought desirable returns
to Captain Palliser throughout a number of years Just now he was
taking an interest in a somewhat imposing scheme or what might prove
an imposing one if it were managed properly and presented to the right
persons If T Tembarom had been sufficiently lured by the spirit of
speculation to plunge into old Hutchinsons affair as he evidently had
done he was plainly of the temperament attracted by the game of chance
There had been no reason but that of temperament which could have led
him to invest He had found himself suddenly a moneyed man and had
liked the game Never having so much as heard of Little Ann Hutchinson
Captain Palliser not unnaturally argued after this wise There seemed no
valid reason why if a vague invention had allured a less vague scheme
managed in a more businesslike manner should not This Mexican silver
and copper mine was a dazzling thing to talk about He could go into
details He had in fact allowed a good deal of detail to trail through
his conversation at times It had not been difficult to accomplish this
in his talks with Lady Mallowe in his hosts presence Lady Mallowe was
always ready to talk of mines gold silver or copper It happened at
times that one could manage to secure a few shares without the actual
payment of money There were little hospitalities or social amiabilities
now and then which might be regarded as value received So she had made
it easy for Captain Palliser to talk and T Tembarom had heard much
which would have been of interest to the kind of young man he appeared
to be Sometimes he had listened absorbedly and on a few occasions he
had asked a few questions which laid him curiously bare in his role of
speculator If he had no practical knowledge of the ways and means of
great mining companies he at least professed none At all events if
there was any little matter he preferred to keep to himself there was
no harm in making oneself familiar with its aspect and significance A
mans arguments so far as he himself is concerned assume the character
with which his own choice of adjectives and adverbs labels them That
is if he labels them The most astute do not Captain Palliser did not
He dealt merely with reasoning processes which were applicable to the
subject in hand whatsoever its nature He was a practical man of
the worlda gentleman of course It was necessary to adjust matters
without romantic hairsplitting It was all by the way

T Tembarom had at the outset seemed to present so to speak no
surface Palliser had soon ceased to be at all sure that his social
ambitions were to be relied on as a lever Besides which when the old
Duke of Stone took delighted possession of him dined with him drove
with him sat and gossiped with him by the hour there was not much one
could offer him Strangeways had at first meant only eccentricity A
little later he had occasionally faintly stirred curiosity and perhaps
the fact that Burrill enjoyed him as a grievance and a mystery had
stimulated the stirring The veriest chance had led him to find himself
regarding the opening up of possible vistas

From a certain window in a certain wing of the house a muchpraised view
was to be seen Nothing was more natural than that on the occasion of a
curious sunset Palliser should in coming from his room decide to take
a look at it As he passed through a corridor Pearson came out of a room
near him

How is Mr Strangeways today Palliser asked

Not quite so well I am afraid sir was the answer

Sorry to hear it replied Palliser and passed on

On his return he walked somewhat slowly down the corridor As he turned
into it he thought he heard the murmur of voices One was that of T
Tembarom and he was evidently using argument It sounded as if he were
persuading some one to agree with him and the persuasion was earnest
He was not arguing with Pearson or a housemaid Why was he arguing with
his pensioner His voice was as low as it was eager and the other mans
replies were not to be heard Only just after Palliser had passed the
door there broke out an appeal which was a sort of cry

No My God no Dont send me away Dont send me away

One could not even if so inclined stand and listen near a door while
servants might chance to be wandering about Palliser went on his way
with a sense of having been slightly startled

He wants to get rid of him and the fellow is giving him trouble he
said to himself That voice is not American Not in the least It set
him thinking and observing When Tembarom wore the look which was not a
look of depression but of something more puzzling he thought that he
could guess at its reason By the time he talked with Lady Mallowe he
had gone much further than he chose to let her know




CHAPTER XXVIII


The popularity of Captain Pallisers story of the Ladies had been
great at the outset but with the passage of time it had oddly waned
This had resulted from the storys ceasing to develop itself as the
simplest intelligence might have anticipated by means of the only
person capable of its proper development The person in question was of
course T Tembarom Expectations amusing expectations of him had been
raised and he had singularly failed in the fulfilling of them The
neighborhood had so to speak stood upon tiptoethe feminine portion
of it at leastlooking over shoulders to get the first glimpses of
what would inevitably take place

As weeks flew by the standing on tiptoe became a thing of the past The
whole thing flattened out most disappointingly No attack whatever was
made upon the Ladies That the Duke of Stone had immensely taken up
Mr Temple Barholm had of course resulted in his being accepted in such
a manner as gave him many opportunities to encounter one and all He
appeared at dinners teas and garden parties Miss Alicia whom he had
in some occult manner impressed upon people until they found themselves
actually paying a sort of court to her was always his companion

One realizes one cannot possibly leave her out of anything had been
said He has somehow established her as if she were his mother or his
auntor his interpreter And such clothes my dear one doesnt behold
Worth and Paquin and Doucet must go sleepless for weeks to invent them
They are without a flaw in shade or line or texture Which was true
because Mrs Mellish of the Bond Street shop had become quite obsessed
by her idea and committed extravagances Miss Alicia offered up contrite
prayer to atone for while Tembarom simply chortling in his glee
signed checks to pay for their exquisite embodiment That he was not
reluctant to avail himself of social opportunities was made manifest by
the fact that he never refused an invitation He appeared upon any spot
to which hospitality bade him and unashamedly placed himself on record
as a neophyte upon almost all occasions His wellcut clothes began in
time to wear more the air of garments belonging to him but his hat
made itself remarked by its trick of getting pushed back on his head
or tilted on side and his New York voice and accent rang out sharp and
finely nasal in the midst of lowpitched throaty or mellow English
enunciations He talked a good deal at times because he found himself
talked to by people who either wanted to draw him out or genuinely
wished to hear the things he would be likely to say

That the hero of Pallisers story should so comport himself as to
provide either diversion or cause for haughty displeasure would have
been only a natural outcome of his ambitions In a brief period of time
however every young woman who might have expected to find herself
an object of such ambitions realized that his methods of approach and
attack were not marked by the usual characteristics of aspirants of his
class He evidently desired to see and be seen He presented himself as
it were for inspection and consideration but while he was attentive
he did not press attentions upon any one He did not make advances in
the ordinary sense of the word He never essayed flattering or even
admiring remarks He said queer things at which one often could not help
but laugh but he somehow wore no air of saying them with the intention
of offering them as witticisms which might be regarded as allurements
He did not ogle he did not simper or shuffle about nervously and turn
red or pale as eager and awkward youths have a habit of doing under
the stress of unrequited admiration In the presence of a certain
slightingness of treatment which he at the outset met with not
infrequently he conducted himself with a detached good nature which
seemed to take but small account of attitudes less unoffending than his
own When the slightingness disappeared from sheer lack of anything to
slight he did not change his manner in any degree

He is not in the least forward Beatrice Talchester said the time
arriving when she and her sisters occasionally talked him over with
their special friends the Granthams and he is not forever under ones
feet as the pushing sort usually is Do you remember those rich
people from the place they called Troythe ones who took Burnaby for
a yearand the awful eldest son who perpetually invented excuses for
calling bringing books and ridiculous things

This one never makes an excuse Amabel Grantham put in

But he never declines an invitation There is no doubt that he wants
to see people said Lady Honora with the pretty little nose and the
dimples She had ceased to turn up the pretty little nose and she
showed a dimple as she added Gwynedd is tremendously taken with him
She is teaching him to play croquet They spend hours together

Hes beginning to play a pretty good game said Gwynedd Hes not
stupid at all events

I believe you are the first choice if he is really choosing Amabel
Grantham decided I should like to ask you a question

Ask it by all means said Gwynedd

Does he ever ask you to show him how to hold his mallet and then do
idiotic things such as managing to touch your hand

Never was Gwynedds answer The young man from Troy used to do it
and then beg pardon and turn red

I dont understand him or I dont understand Captain Pallisers
story Amabel Grantham argued Lucy and I are quite out of the
running but I honestly believe that he takes as much notice of us as
he does of any of you If he has intentions he doesnt act the part
which is pure New York of the first water

He said however that the things that mattered were not only titles
but looks He asked how many of us were lookers Dont be modest
Amabel Neither you nor Lucy are out of the running Beatrice amiably
suggested

Ladies first commented Amabel pertly There was no objection to
being supported in ones suspicion that after all one was a looker

There may be a sort of explanation Honora put the idea forward
somewhat thoughtfully Captain Palliser insists that he is much
shrewder than he seems Perhaps he is cautious and is looking us all
over before he commits himself

He is a Temple Barholm after all said Gwynedd with boldness Hes
rather good looking He has the nicest white teeth and the most cheering
grin I ever saw and hes as rich as grease is as I heard a
housemaid say one day Im getting quite resigned to his voice or it
is improving I dont know which If he only knew the mere A B C of
ordinary people like ourselves and he committed himself to me I
wouldnt lay my hand on my heart and say that one might not think him
over

I told you she was tremendously taken with him said her sister Its
come to this

But said Lady Gwynedd he is not going to commit himself to any of
us incredible as it may seem The one person he stares at sometimes is
Joan Fayre and he only looks at her as if he were curious and wouldnt
object to finding out why she treats him so outrageously He isnt
annoyed hes only curious

Hes been adored by salesladies in New York said Honora and he
cant understand it

Hes been liked Amabel Grantham summed him up Hes a likable thing
Hes even rather a dear Ive begun to like him myself

I hear you are learning to play croquet the Duke of Stone remarked to
him a day or so later How do you like it

Lady Gwynedd Talchester is teaching me Tembarom answered Id learn
to iron shirtwaists if she would give me lessons Shes one of the two
that have dimples he added reflection in his tone I guess thatll
count Shouldnt you think it would

Miss Hutchinson queried the duke

Tembarom nodded

Yes its always her he answered without a ray of humor I just want
to stack em up

You are doing it the duke replied with a slightly twisted mouth
There were in fact moments when he might have fallen into fits of
laughter while Tembarom was seriousness itself I must however call
your attention to the fact that there is sometimes in your manner a hint
of a businesslike pursuit of a fixed object which you must beware
of The Lady Gwynedds might not enjoy the situation if they began to
suspect If they decided to flout youto throw you down I ought to
saywhere would little Miss Hutchinson be

Tembarom looked startled and disturbed

Say he exclaimed do I ever look that way I must do better than
that Anyhow it aint all put on Im doing my stunt of course but I
like them Theyre mighty nice to me when you consider what theyre up
against And those two with the dimplesLady Gwynned and Lady Honora
are just peaches Any fellow mighthe stopped and looked serious
againThats why theyd count he added

They were having one of their odd long talks under a particularly
splendid copper beech which provided the sheltered outofdoor corner
his grace liked best When they took their seats together in this
retreat it was mysteriously understood that they were settling
themselves down to enjoyment of their own and must not be disturbed

When I am comfortable and entertained Moffat the house steward had
quoted his master as saying you may mention it if the castle is in
flames but do not annoy me with excitement and flurry Ring the bell in
the courtyard and call up the servants to pass buckets but until the
lawn catches fire I must insist on being left alone

What dear papa talks to him about and what he talks about to dear
papa Lady Celia had more than once murmured in her gently remote
highnosed way I cannot possibly imagine Sometimes when I have passed
them on my way to the croquet lawn I have really seen them both look as
absorbed as people in a play Of course it is very good for papa It has
had quite a marked effect on his digestion But isnt it odd

I wish Lady Edith remarked almost wistfully that I could get on
better with him myself conversationally But I dont know what to talk
about and it makes me nervous

Their father on the contrary found in him unique resources and this
afternoon it occurred to him that he had never so far heard him express
himself freely on the subject of Palliser If led to do so he would
probably reveal that he had views of Captain Palliser of which he might
not have been suspected and the manner in which they would unfold
themselves would more than probably be illuminating The duke was in
fact serenely sure that he required neither warning nor advice and he
had no intention of offering either He wanted to hear the views

Do you know he said as he stirred his tea Ive been thinking about
Palliser and it has occurred to me more than once that I should like to
hear just how he strikes you

What I got on to first was how I struck him answered Tembarom with a
reasonable air That was dead easy

There was no hint of any vaunt of superior shrewdness His was merely
the leveltoned manner of an observer of facts in detail

He has given you an opportunity of seeing a good deal of him the duke
added What do you gather from himunless he has made up his mind that
you shall not gather anything at all

A fellow like that couldnt fix it that way however much he wanted
to Tembarom answered again reasonably Just his trying to do it would
give him away

You mean you have gathered things

Oh Ive gathered enough though I didnt go after it It hung on the
bushes Anyhow it seemed to me that way I guess you run up against
that kind everywhere Theres stacks of them in New Yorkdifferent
shapes and sizes

If you met a man of his particular shape and size in New York how
would you describe him the duke asked

I should never have met him when I was there He wouldnt have come
my way Hed have been on Wall Street doing highclass bucketshop
business or hed have had a swell office selling copperminesany old
kind of mine thats going to make ten million a minute the sort of
deal hes in now If hed been the kind I might have run up against
he added with deliberation he wouldnt have been as well dressed or
as well spoken Hed have been either flashy or down at heel Youd have
called him a crook

The duke seemed pleased with his tea as after having sipped it he put
it down on the table at his side

A crook he repeated I wonder if that word is altogether American

Its not complimentary but you asked me said Tembarom But I dont
believe you asked me because you thought I wasnt on to him

Frankly speaking no answered the duke Does he talk to you about
the mammoth mines and the rubber forests

Say thats where he wins out with me Tembarom replied admiringly
He gets in such fine work that I switch him on to it whenever I want
cheering up It makes me sorter forget things that worry me just to see
a man act the part right up to the top notch the way he does it The
very way his clothes fit the style hes got his hair brushed and that
swell careless lounge of his are half of the makeup You see most of
us couldnt mistake him for anything else but just what he looks likea
gentleman visiting round among his friends and a million miles from
wanting to butt in with business The thing that first got me interested
was watching how he slid in the sort of guff he wanted you to get worked
up about and think over Why if Id been what I look like to him hed
have had my pile long ago and he wouldnt be loafing round here any
more

What do you think you look like to him his host inquired

I look as if Id eat out of his hand Tembarom answered quite
unbiased by any touch of wounded vanity Why shouldnt I And Im not
trying to wake him up either I like to look that way to him and to
his sort It gives me a chance to watch and get wise to things Hes a
highschool education in himself I like to hear him talk I asked him
to come and stay at the house so that I could hear him talk

Did he introduce the mammoth mines in his first call the duke
inquired

Oh I dont mean that kind of talk I didnt know how much good I was
going to get out of him at first But he was the kind I hadnt known
and it seemed like he was part of the whole thinglike the girls with
title that Ann said I must get next to And an easy way of getting next
to the man kind was to let him come and stay He wanted to all right
I guess thats the way he lives when hes down on his luck getting
invited to stay at places Like Lady Mallowe he added quite without
prejudice

You do sum them up dont you smiled the duke

Well I dont see how I could help it he said impartially Theyre
printed in sixtyfour point blackface seems to me

What is that the duke inquired with interest He thought it might be
a new and desirable bit of slang I dont know that one

Biggest type there is grinned Tembarom Its the kind thats used
for headlines Thats newspaperoffice talk

Ah technical I see What by the way is the smallest lettering
called his grace followed up

Brilliant answered Tembarom

You remarked the duke are not printed in sixtyfourpoint
blackface so far as they are concerned You are not even brilliant
They dont find themselves able to sum you up That fact is one of my
recreations

Ill tell you why Tembarom explained with his clearly unprejudiced
air Theres nothing much about me to sum up anyhow Im too sort of
plain sailing and ordinary Im not making for anywhere theyd think Id
want to go Im not hiding anything theyd be sure Id want to hide

By the Lord youre not exclaimed the duke

When I first came here every one of them had a fool idea Id want
to pretend Id never set eyes on a newsboy or a bootblack and that I
couldnt find my way in New York when I got off Fifth Avenue I used
to see them thinking theyd got to look as if they believed it if they
wanted to keep next When I just let out and showed I didnt care a darn
and hadnt sense enough to know that it mattered it nearly made them
throw a fit They had to turn round and fix their faces all over again
and act like it was interesting Thats what Lady Mallowe calls it
She says its so interesting

It is commented the duke

Well you know that but she doesnt Not on your life I guess it
makes her about sick to think of it and have to play that its just what
youd want all your men friends to have done Now Palliser he paused
and grinned again He was sitting in a most casual attitude his hands
clasped round one upraised knee which he nursed balancing himself It
was a position of informal ease which had an air of assisting enjoyable
reflection

Yes Palliser Dont let us neglect Palliser his host encouraged him

Hes in a worse mixup than the rest because hes got more to lose If
he could work this mammothmine song and dance with the right people
thered be money enough in it to put him on Easy Street Thats where
hes aiming for The companys just where it has to have a boost
Its just GOT to If it doesnt therell be a bust up that may end in
fitting out a hightoned promoter or so in a striped yellowandblack
Jersey suit and set him to breaking rocks or playing with oakum Ill
tell you poor old Palliser gets the Willies sometimes after hes read
his mail He turns the color of ecru baby Irish Thats a kind of lace I
got a dressmaker to tell me about when I wrote up receptions and dances
for the Sunday Earth Ecru baby Irishthats Pallisers color after
hes read his letters

I dare say the fellows in a devil of a mess if the truth were known
the duke said

And heres T T handmade and handpainted for the part of the kind
of sucker he wants T Tembaroms manner was almost sympathetic in its
appreciation I can tell you Im having a real good time with Palliser
It looked like Id just dropped from heaven when he first saw me If
hed been the praying kind Id have been just the sort hed have prayed
for when he said his NowIlaymes before he went to bed There
wasnt a chance in a hundred that I wasnt a fool that had his head
swelled so that hed swallow any darned thing if you handed it to him
smooth enough First time he called he asked me a lot of questions about
New York business That was pretty smart of him He wanted to find out
sort of careless how much I knewor how little

The duke was leaning back luxuriously in his chair and gazing at him as
he might have gazed at the work of an old master of which each line and
shade was of absorbing interest

I can see him he said I can see him

He found out I knew nothing Tembarom continued And what was to
hinder him trying to teach me something by gee Nothing on top of the
green earth I was there waiting with my mouth open it seemed like

And he has triedin his best manner said his grace

What he hasnt tried wouldnt be worthy trying Tembarom answered
cheerfully Sometimes it seems like a shame to waste it Ive got so
I know how to start him when he doesnt know Im doing it I tell you
hes fine Gentlemanlythats his way you know Hightoned friend that
just happens to know of a good thing and thinks enough of you in a sort
of reserved way to feel like its a pity not to give you a chance to
come in on the ground floor if youve got the sense to see the favor
hes friendly enough to do you Its such a favor that itd just disgust
a man if you could possibly turn it down But of course youre to take
it or leave it Its not to his interest to push it Lord no Whatever
you did his way is that hed not condescend to say a darned word
Hightoned silence thats all

The Duke of Stone was chuckling very softly His chuckles rather broke
his words when he spoke

BybyJove he said Youyou do see it dont you You do see it

Tembarom nursed his knee comfortably

Why he said its what keeps me up You know a lot more about me
than any one else does but theres a whole raft of things I think about
that I couldnt hang round any mans neck If I tried to hang them round
yours youd know that I would be having a hell of a time here if Id
let myself think too much If I didnt see it as you call it if I
didnt see so many things I might begin to get sorry for myself There
was a pause of a second Gee he said Gee this not hearing a thing
about Ann


Good Lord my dear fellow the duke said hastily I know I know

Tembarom turned and looked at him

Youve been there he remarked Youve been there I bet

Yes Ive been there answered the duke Ive been thereand come
back But while its going onyou have just described it A man can
have a hell of a time

He can Tembarom admitted unreservedly Hes got to keep going to
stand it Well Strangeways gives me some work to do And Ive got
Palliser Hes a little sunbeam

A manservant approaching to suggest a possible need of hot tea started
at hearing his grace break into a sudden and plainly involuntary crow
of glee He had not heard that one before either Palliser as a little
sunbeam brightening the pathway of T Tembarom was in the particular
existing circumstances all that could be desired of fine humor It
somewhat recalled the situation of the Ladies of the noble houses of
Pevensy Talchester and Stone unconsciously passing in review for
the satisfaction of little Miss Hutchinson Tembarom laughed a little
himself but he went on with a sort of seriousness

Theres one thing sure enough Ive got on to it by listening and
working out what he would do by what he doesnt know he says If he
could put the screws on me in any way he wouldnt hold back Itd be
all quite polite and gentlemanly but hed do it all the same And hes
deadsure that everybodys got something theyd like to hideor get
Thats what he works things out from

Does he think you have something to hideor get the duke inquired
rather quickly

Hes sure of it But he doesnt know yet whether its get or hide He
noses about Pearsons seen him He asks questions and plays he aint
doing it and aint interested anyhow

He doesnt like you he doesnt like you the duke said rather
thoughtfully He has a way of conveying that you are far more subtle
than you choose to look He is given to enlarging on the fact that an
air of entire frankness is one of the chief assets of certain promoters
of huge American schemes

Tembarom smiled the smile of recognition

Yes he said it looks like thats a long way round doesnt it But
its not far to T T when you want to hitch on the connection Anyhow
thats the way he means it to look If ever I was suspected of being in
any mixup everybody would remember hed said that

Its very amusin said the duke Its very amusin

They had become even greater friends and intimates by this time than the
already astonished neighborhood suspected them of being That they spent
much time together in an amazing degree of familiarity was the talk
of the country in fact one of the most frequent resources of
conversation Everybody endeavored to find reason for the situation
but none had been presented which seemed of sufficiently logical
convincingness The duke was eccentric of course That was easy to
hit upon He was amiably perverse and goodhumoredly cynical He was
of course immensely amused by the incongruity of the acquaintance This
being the case why exactly he had never before chosen for himself a
companion equally out of the picture it was not easy to explain There
were plowboys or clerks out of provincial shops who would surely have
been quite as incongruous when surrounded by ducal splendors He might
have got a young man from Liverpool or Blackburn who would have known
as little of polite society as Mr Temple Barholm there were few of
course who could know less But he had never shown the faintest desire
to seek one out Palliser it is true suggested it was Tembaroms
cheek which stood him in good stead The young man from behind the
counter in a Liverpool or Blackburn shop would probably have been
frightened to death and afraid to open his mouth in selfrevelation
whereas Temple Barholm was so entirely a bounder that he did not know
he was one and was ready to make an ass of himself to any extent The
frankest statement of the situation if any one had so chosen to put it
would have been that he was regarded as a sort of court fool without cap
or bells

No one was aware of the odd confidences which passed between the weirdly
dissimilar pair No one guessed that the old peer sat and listened
to stories of a redheaded slimbodied girl in a dingy New York
boardinghouse that he liked them sufficiently to encourage their
telling that he had made a mental picture of a certain look in a pair
of maternally yearning and fearfully convincing round young eyes that
he knew the burnished fullness and glow of the red hair until he could
imagine the feeling of its texture and abundant warmth in the hand
And this subject was only one of many And of others they talked with
interest doubt argument speculation holding a living thrill

The tap of croquet mallets sounded hollow and clear from the sunken
lawn below the mass of shrubs between them and the players as the duke
repeated

Its hugely amusin dropping his g which was not one of his usual
affectations

Confound it he said next wrinkling the thin fine skin round his
eyes in a speculative smile I wish I had had a son of my own just like
you

All of Tembaroms white teeth revealed themselves

Id have liked to have been in it he replied but I shouldnt have
been like me

Yes you would The duke put the tips of his fingers delicately
together You are of the kind which in all circumstances is like
itself He looked about him taking in the turreted majestic age
and mass of the castle You would have been born here You would have
learned to ride your pony down the avenue You would have gone to Eton
and to Oxford I dont think you would have learned much but you would
have been decidedly edifying and companionable You would have had
a sense of humor which would have made you popular in society and at
court A young fellow who makes those people laugh holds success in his
hand They want to be made to laugh as much as I do Good God how they
are obliged to be bored and behave decently under it You would have
seen and known more things to be humorous about than you know now I
dont think you would have been a fool about women but some of them
would have been fools about you because youve got a way I had one
myself Its all the more dangerous because its possibility suggesting
without being sentimental A friendly young fellow always suggests
possibilities without being aware of it

Would I have been Lord Temple Temple Barholm or something of that
sort Tembarom asked

You would have been the Marquis of Belcarey the duke replied looking
him over thoughtfully and your name would probably have been Hugh
Lawrence Gilbert Henry Charles Adelbert or words to that effect

A regular sixshooter said Tembarom

The duke was following it up with absorption in his eyes

Youd have gone into the Guards perhaps he said and drill would
have made you carry yourself better Youre a good height Youd have
been a wellsetup fellow I should have been rather proud of you I can
see you riding to the palace with the rest of them sabres and chains
clanking and glittering and helmet with plumes streaming By Jove
I dont wonder at the effect they have on nurserymaids On a sunny
morning in spring they suggest knights in a fairytale

I should have liked it all right if I hadnt been born in Brooklyn
grinned Tembarom But that starts you out in a different way Do you
think if Id been born the Marquis of Belwhats his nameI should
have been on to Pallisers little song and dance and had as much fun
out of it

On my soul I believe you would the duke answered Brooklyn or
Stone Hover Castle Im hanged if you wouldnt have been YOU




CHAPTER XXIX


After this came a pause Each man sat thinking his own thoughts which
while marked with difference in form were doubtless subtly alike in
the line they followed During the silence T Tembarom looked out at the
late afternoon shadows lengthening themselves in darkening velvet across
the lawns

At last he said

I never told you that Ive been reading some of the steen thousand
books in the library I started it about a month ago And somehow
theyve got me going

The slightly lifted eyebrows of his host did not express surprise so
much as questioning interest This man at least had discovered that
one need find no cause for astonishment in any discovery that he
had been doing a thing for some time for some reason or through some
prompting of his own and had said nothing whatever about it until he
was what he called good and ready When he was good and ready he
usually revealed himself to the duke but he was not equally expansive
with others

No you have not mentioned it his grace answered and laughed a
little You frequently fail to mention things When first we knew each
other I used to wonder if you were naturally a secretive fellow but you
are not You always have a reason for your silences

It took about ten years to kick that into meten good years I should
say T Tembarom looked as if he were looking backward at many episodes
as he said it Naturally I guess I must have been an innocent
blabmouthed kid I meant no harm but I just didnt know Sometimes
it looks as if just not knowing is about the worst disease you can be
troubled with But if you dont get killed first you find out in time
that what youve got to hold on to hard and fast is the trick of saying
nothing and sawing wood

The duke took out his memorandumbook and began to write hastily T
Tembarom was quite accustomed to this He even repeated his axiom for
him

Say nothing and saw wood he said Its worth writing down It means
shut your mouth and keep on working

Thank you said the duke It is worth writing down Thank you

I did not talk about the books because I wanted to get used to them
before I began to talk Tembarom explained I wanted to get somewhere
Id never read a book through in my life before Never wanted to
Never had one and never had time When night came I was dogtired and
dogready to drop down and sleep

Here was a situation of interest A young man of odd direct shrewdness
who had never read a book through in his existence had plunged suddenly
into the extraordinarily varied literary resources of the Temple Barholm
library If he had been a fool or a genius one might have guessed at the
impression made on him being T Tembarom one speculated with secret
elation The primitiveness he might reveal the profundities he might
touch the surface of the unexpected ends he might reach suggested the
opening of vistas

I have often thought that if books attracted you the library would help
you to get through a good many of the hundred and thirtysix hours a day
youve spoken of and get through them pretty decently commented the
duke

Thats whats happened Tembarom answered Theres not so many now I
can cut em off in chunks

How did it begin

He listened with much pleasure while Tembarom told him how it had begun
and how it had gone on

Id been having a pretty bad time one day Strangeways had been
worsea darned sight worsejust when I thought he was better Id
been trying to help him to think straight and suddenly I made a break
somehow and must have touched exactly the wrong spring It seemed as if
I set him nearly crazy I had to leave him to Pearson right away Then
it poured rain steady for about eight hours and I couldnt get out and
take a walk Then I went wandering into the picturegallery and found
Lady Joan there looking at Miles Hugo And she ordered me out or
blamed near it

You are standing a good deal said the duke

Yes I ambut so is she He set his hard young jaw and nursed his
knee staring once more at the velvet shadows The girl in the book I
picked up he began

The first book his host inquired

Tembarom nodded

The very first I was smoking my pipe at night after every one else
had gone to bed and I got up and began to wander about and stare at the
names of the things on the shelves I was thinking over a whole raft of
thingsa whole raft of themand I didnt know I was doing it until
something made me stop and read a name again It was a book called
Goodby Sweetheart Goodby and it hit me straight I wondered what
it was about and I wondered where old Temple Barholm had fished up a
thing like that I never heard he was that kind

He was a cantankerous old brute said the Duke of Stone with candor
but he chanced to be an omnivorous novelreader Nothing was too
sentimental for him in his later years

I took the thing out and read it Tembarom went on uneasily the
emotion of his first novelreading stirring him as he talked It kept
me up half the night and I hadnt finished it then I wanted to know
the end

Benisons upon the books of which one wants to know the end the duke
murmured

Tembaroms interest had plainly not terminated with the end Its
freshness made it easily revived There was a hint of emotional
indignation in his relation of the plot

It was about a couple of fools who were dead stuck on each otherdead
There was no mistake about that It was all real But what do they
do but work up a fool quarrel about nothing and break away from each
other There was a lot of stuff about pride Pride be damned Hows a
man going to be proud and put on airs when he loves a woman Hows a
woman going to be proud and stick out about things when she loves a man
At least thats the way it hit me

Thats the way it hit meonce remarked his grace

There is only once said Tembarom doggedly

Occasionally said his host Occasionally

Tembarom knew what he meant

The fellow went away and neither of them would give in Its queer
how real it was when you read it You were right there looking on and
swallowing hard every few minutesthough you were as mad as hops The
girl began to dieslowand lay there day after day longing for him
to come back and knowing he wouldnt At the very end when there was
scarcely a breath left in her a young fellow who was crazy about her
himself and always had been put out after the hardheaded fool to
bring him to her anyhow The girl had about given in then And she lay
and waited hour after hour and the youngster came back by himself He
couldnt bring the man hed gone after He found him getting married to
a nice girl he didnt really care a darn for Hed sort of set his teeth
and done itjust because he was all in and down and out and a fool
The girl just dropped her head back on the pillow and lay there dead
What do you think of that quite fiercely I guess it was sentimental
all right but it got you by the throat

Goodbye Sweetheart Goodbye his grace quoted Firstclass
title We are all sentimental And that was the first was it

Yes but it wasnt the last I began to read the others Ive been
reading them ever since I tell you for a fellow that knows nothing
its an easy way of finding out a lot of things You find out what
different kinds of people there are and what different kinds of ways
If youve lived in one place and been up against nothing but earning
your living you think thats all there is of itthat its the whole
thing But it isnt by gee His air became thoughtful Ive begun
to kind of get on to what all this meansglancing about himto you
people and how a fellow like T T must look to you Ive always sort
of guessed but reading a few dozen novels has helped me to see WHY
its that way Ive yelled right out laughing over it many a time
That fellow called ThackerayI cant read his things right straight
throughbut he s an eyeopener

You have tried nothing BUT novels his enthralled hearer inquired

Not yet I shall come to the others in time Im sort of hungry for
these things about PEOPLE Its the ways theyre different that gets
me going There was one that stirred me all upbut it wasnt like that
first one It was about a man he spoke slowly as if searching for
words and parallelswell I guess he was one of the early savages
here It read as if they were like the first Indians in America only
stronger and fiercer When Palford was explaining things to me hed jerk
in every now and then something about coming over with the Conqueror
or being here before the Conqueror I didnt know what it meant I
found out in this book Im telling about It gave me the whole thing
so that you SAW it Here was this little country with no one in it but
these first savage fellows itd always belonged to They thought it
was the world There was a humorous sense of illumination in his
halflaugh It was their New York by jings he put in Their little
old New York that theyd never been outside of And then first one lot
slams in and then another and another and tries to take it from them
Julius Caesar was the first Mr Buttinski and they fought like hell
They were fighters from Fightersville anyhow They fought each other
took each others castles and lands and wives and jewelryjust any
old thing they wanted The only jails were private ones meant for their
particular friends And a man was hung only when one of his neighbors
got mad enough at him and then he had to catch him first and run the
risk of being strung up himself or have his head chopped off and stuck
up on a spike somewhere for ornament But fight Good Lord They were at
it day and night Did it for fun just like folks go to the show They
didnt know what fear was Never heard of it Theyd go about shouting
and bragging and swaggering with their heads hanging half off And the
one in this book was the bulliest fighter of the lot I guess I dont
know how to pronounce his name It began with H

Was it Hereward the Wake by chance exclaimed his auditor Hereward
the Last of the English

Thats the man cried Tembarom

An engaging ruffian and thief and murderer and a touching one also
commented the duke You liked him He really wanted to know

I like the way he went after what he wanted to get and the way he
fought for his bit of England By gee When he went rushing into a
fight shouting and boasting and swinging his sword I got hot in the
collar It was his England What was old Bill doing there anyhow darn
him Those chaps made him swim in their blood before they let him put
the thing over Good business Im glad they gave him all that was
coming to himhot and strong

His sharp face had reddened and his voice rose high and nasal There was
a look of roused blood in him

Are you a fighter from Fightersville the duke asked far from
unstirred himself These things had become myths to most people but
here was Broadway in the midst of them unconsciously suggesting that it
might not have done ill in the matter of swinging BrainBiter itself
The modern entity slipped back again through the lengthened links of
bygone centuriesback until it became T Tembarom once morecasual
though shrewd ready and jocular His eyes resumed their dry New York
humor of expression as they fixed themselves on his wholly modern
questioner

Ill fight he said for what Ive got to fight for but not for a
darned thing else Not a darned thing

But you would fight smiled the duke grimly Did you happen to
remember that blood like that has come down to you It was some drop of
it which made you hot in the collar over that engaging savage roaring
and slashing about him for his bit of England

Tembarom seemed to think it out interestedly

No I did not he answered But I guess thats so I guess its so
Great Jakes Think of me perhaps being sort of kin to fellows just like
that Some way you couldnt help liking him He was always making big
breaks and bellowing out The Wake The Wake in season and out of
season but the way he got therejust got there

He was oddly in sympathy with the early savages here and as
understandingly put himself into their places as he had put himself
into Galtons His New York comprehension of their berserker furies was
apparently without limit Strong partizan as he was of the last of the
English however he admitted that William of Normandy had got in some
good work though it wasnt square

He was a big man he ended If he hadnt been the kind he was I dont
know how I should have stood it when the Hereward fellow knelt down
before him and put his hands between his and swore to be his man
Thats the way the book said it I tell you that must have been
toughtough as hell

From Goodbye Sweetheart to Hereward the Last of the English was a
far cry but he had gathered a curious collection of ideas by the way
and with characteristic everyday reasoning had linked them to his own
experiences

The women in the Hereward book made me think of Lady Joan he
remarked suddenly

Torfreda the duke asked

He nodded quite seriously

She had ways that reminded me of her and I kept thinking they must
both have had the same look in their eyessort of fierce and hungry
Torfreda had black hair and was a winner as to looks but people were
afraid of her and called her a witch Hereward went mad over her and
she went mad over him That part of it was way out of sight it was so
fine She helped him with his fights and told him what to do and tried
to keep him from drinking and bragging Whatever he did she never
stopped being crazy about him She mended his mens clothes and took
care of their wounds and lived in the forest with him when he was
driven out

That sounds rather like Miss Hutchinson his host suggested though
the parallel between a Harlem flat and an English forest in the eleventh
century is not exact

I thought that too Tembarom admitted Ann would have done the same
things but shed have done them in her way If that fellow had taken
his wifes advice he wouldnt have ended with his head sticking on a
spear

Another lady if I remember rightly said the duke

He left her the fool Tembarom answered And theres where I
couldnt get away from seeing Lady Joan Jem Temple Barholm didnt go
off with another woman but what Torfreda went through this one has
gone through and shes going through it yet She cant dress herself in
sackcloth and cut off her hair and hide herself away with a bunch of
nuns as the other one did She has to stay and stick it out however
bad it is Thats a darned sight worse The day after Id finished the
book I couldnt keep my eyes off her I tried to stop it but it was no
use I kept hearing that Torfreda one screaming out Lost Lost Lost
It was all in her face

But my good fellow protested the duke despite feeling a touch of
the thrill again unfortunately she would not suspect you of looking
at her because you were recalling Torfreda and Hereward the Wake Men
stare at her for another reason

Thats what I know about half as well again as I know anything else
answered Tembarom He added with a deliberation holding its own
meaning Thats what Im coming to

The duke waited What was it he was coming to

Reading that novel put me wise to things in a new way Shes been
wiping her feet on me hard for a good while and I sort of made up my
mind Id got to let her until I was sure where I was I wont say I
didnt mind it but I could stand it But that night she caught me
looking at her the way she looked back at me made me see all of a
sudden that it would be easier for her if I told her straight that she
was mistaken

That she is mistaken in thinking

What she does think She wouldnt have thought it if the old lady
hadnt been driving her mad by hammering it in Shed have hated me all
right and I dont blame her when I think of how poor Jem was treated
but she wouldnt have thought that every time I tried to be decent and
friendly to her I was butting in and making a sick fool of myself Shes
got to stay where her mother keeps her and shes got to listen to her
Oh hell Shes got to be told

The duke set the tips of his fingers together

How would you do it he inquired

Just straight replied T Tembarom Theres no other way

From the old worldling broke forth an involuntary low laugh which was a
sort of cackle So this was what he was coming to

I cannot think of any devious method he said which would make it
less than a delicate thing to do A beautiful young woman whose host
you are has flouted you furiously for weeks under the impression that
you are offensively in love with her You propose to tell her that
her judgment has betrayed her and that as you say Theres nothing
doing

Not a darned thing and never has been said T Tembarom He looked
quite grave and not at all embarrassed He plainly did not see it as a
situation to be regarded with humor

If she will listen the duke began

Oh shell listen put in Tembarom Ill make her

His was a selfcontradicting countenance the duke reflected as he took
him in with a somewhat long look One did not usually see a face built
up of boyishness and maturity simpleness which was baffling and a good
nature which could be hard At the moment it was both of these last at
one and the same time

I know something of Lady Joan and I know something of you he said
but I dont exactly foresee what will happen I will not say that I
should not like to be present

Therell be nobody present but just me and her Tembarom answered




CHAPTER XXX


The visits of Lady Mallowe and Captain Palliser had had their features
Neither of the pair had come to one of the most imposing places in
Lancashire to live a life of hermitlike seclusion and dullness They
had arrived with the intention of availing themselves of all such
opportunities for entertainment as could be guided in their direction by
the deftness of experience As a result there had been hospitalities at
Temple Barholm such as it had not beheld during the last generation
at least T Tembarom had looked on an interested spectator as these
festivities had been adroitly arranged and managed for him He had not
however in the least resented acting as a sort of figurehead in the
position of sponsor and host

They think I dont know Im not doing it all myself was his easy
mental summingup Theyve got the idea that Im pleased because I
believe Im It But thats all to the merry Its what Ive set my mind
on having going on here and I couldnt have started it as well myself
I shouldnt have known how Theyre teaching me All I hope is that
Anns grandmother is keeping tab

Do you and Rose know old Mrs Hutchinson he had inquired of Pearson
the night before the talk with the duke

Well not to say exactly know her sir but everybody knows of her She
is a most remarkable old person sir Then after watching his face for
a moment or so he added tentatively Would you perhaps wish us to make
her acquaintance forfor any reason

Tembarom thought the matter over speculatively He had learned that his
first liking for Pearson had been founded upon a rock He was always to
be trusted to understand and also to apply a quite unusual intelligence
to such matters as he became aware of without having been told about
them

What Id like would be for her to hear that theres plenty doing at
Temple Barholm that people are coming and going all the time and that
theres ladies to burnand most of them lookers at that was his
answer

How Pearson had discovered the exotic subtleties of his masters
situation and mental attitude toward it only those of his class and
gifted with his occult powers could explain in detail The fact exists
that Pearson did know an immense number of things his employer had not
mentioned to him and held them locked in his bosom in honored security
like a little gentleman He made his reply with a polite conviction
which carried weight

It would not be necessary for either Rose or me to make old Mrs
Hutchinsons acquaintance with a view to informing her of anything
which occurs on the estate or in the village sir he remarked Mrs
Hutchinson knows more of things than any one ever tells her She sits in
her cottage there and she just knows things and sees through people in
a way thatd be almost unearthly if she wasnt a good old person and
so respectable that theres those that touches their hats to her as if
she belonged to the gentry Shes got a blue eye sir

Has she exclaimed Tembarom

Yes sir As blue as a babys sir and as clear though shes past
eighty And they tell me theres a quiet steady look in it that
illdoers downright quail before Its as if she was a kind of judge
that sentenced them without speaking They cant stand it Oh sir you
can depend upon old Mrs Hutchinson as to whos been here and even what
theyve thought about it The village just flocks to her to tell her the
news and get advice about things Shed know

It was as a result of this that on his return from Stone Hover he
dismissed the carriage at the gates and walked through them to make a
visit in the village Old Mrs Hutchinson sitting knitting in her chair
behind the abnormally flourishing fuchsias geraniums and campanula
carpaticas in her cottagewindow looked between the bankedup
flowerpots to see that Mr Temple Barholm had opened her wicketgate
and was walking up the clean bricked path to her front door When he
knocked she called out in the broad Lancashire she had always spoken
Coom in When he entered he took off his hat and looked at her
friendly but hesitant and with the expression of a young man who has
not quite made up his mind as to what he is about to encounter

Im Temple Temple Barholm Mrs Hutchinson he announced

I know that she answered Not that tha looks loike th Temple
Barholms but Ive been watchin thee walk an drive past here ever
since tha coom to th place

She watched him steadily with an astonishingly limpid pair of old eyes
They were old and young at the same time old because they held deeps of
wisdom young because they were so alive and full of question

I dont know whether I ought to have come to see you or not he said

Well thast coom she replied going on with her knitting Sit thee
doun and have a bit of a chat

Say he broke out Aint you going to shake hands with me He held
his hand out impetuously He knew he was all right if shed shake hands

Theers nowt agen that surely she answered with a shrewd bit of a
smile She gave him her hand If I was na stiff in my legs its my
place to get up an mak thee a curtsey but th rheumatics has no
respect even for th lord o th manor

If you got up and made me a curtsey Tembarom said I should throw a
fit Say Mrs Hutchinson I bet you know that as well as I do

The shrewd bit of a smile lighted her eyes as well as twinkled about her
mouth

Sit thee doun she said again

So he sat down and looked at her as straight as she looked at him

Tha d give a good bit she said presently over her flashing needles
to know how much Little Anns towd me about thee

Id give a lot to know how much itd be square to ask you to tell me
about her he gave back to her hesitating yet eager

What does tha mean by square she demanded

I mean fair Can I talk to you about her at all I promised Id stick
it out here and do as she said She told me she wasnt going to write
to me or let her father write Ive promised and Im not going to fall
down when Ive said a thing

So tha coom to see her grandmother

He reddened but held his head up

Im not going to ask her grandmother a thing she doesnt want me to be
told But Ive been up against it pretty hard lately I read some things
in the New York papers about her father and his invention and about her
traveling round with him and helping him with his business

In Germany they wur she put in forgetting herself Theyre havin
big doins over th invention What Joe ud do wiout th lass I canna
tell Shes doin every bit o th managin an contrivin wi them
furrinersbut hell never know it Shes got a chap to travel wi him
as can talk aw th languages under th sun

Her face flushed and she stopped herself sharply

Im talkin about her to thee she said I would na ha believed o
mysen

He got up from his chair

I guess I oughtnt to have come he said restlessly But you havent
told me more than I got here and there in the papers That was what
started me It was like watching her I could hear her talking and
see the way she was doing things till it drove me half crazy All of a
sudden I just got wild and made up my mind Id come here Ive wanted
to do it many a time but Ive kept away

Tha showed sense i doin that remarked Mrs Hutchinson Shed not
ha thowt well o thee if thad coom runnin to her grandmother every
day or so What she likes about thee is as she thinks thas got a strong
backbone o thy own

She looked up at him over her knitting looked straight into his eyes
and there was that in her own which made him redden and feel his pulse
quicken It was actually something which even remotely suggested that
she was notin the deeps of her strong old mindas wholly unswerving
as her words might imply It was something more subtle than words She
was not keeping him wholly in the dark when she said What she likes
about thee If Ann said things like that to her he was pretty well
off

Happen a look at a lasss grandmotherwhen tha conna get at th lass
hersenis a bit o comfort she added But dont tha go walkin by
here to look in at th window too often She would na think well o that
either

Say Theres one thing Im going to get off my chest before I go he
announced just one thing She can go where she likes and do what she
likes but Im going to marry her when shes done itunless something
knocks me on the head and finishes me Im going to marry her

Tha art art tha laconically but her eyes were still on his and the
something in their depths by no means diminished

Im keeping up my end here and its no slouch of a job but Im not
forgetting what she promised for one minute And Im not forgetting what
her promise means he said obstinately

Thad like me to tell her that she said

If she doesnt know it you telling her wouldnt cut any ice was his
reply Im saying it because I want you to know it and because it does
me good to say it out loud Im going to marry her

Thats for her and thee to settle she commented impersonally

It is settled he answered There s no way out of it Will you shake
hands with me again before I go

Aye she consented I will

When she took his hand she held it a minute Her own was warm and there
was no limpness about it The secret which had seemed to conceal itself
behind her eyes had some difficulty in keeping itself wholly in the
background

She knows aw tha does she said coolly as if she were not suddenly
revealing immensities She knows who cooms an who goes an what they
think o thee an how tha gets on wi em Now get thee gone lad an
dunnot tha coom back till her or me sends for thee



Within an hour of this time the afternoon post brought to Lady Mallowe
a letter which she read with an expression in which her daughter
recognized relief It was in fact a letter for which she had waited with
anxiety and the invitation it contained was a tribute to her social
skill at its highest watermark In her less heroic moments she had
felt doubts of receiving it which had caused shudders to run the entire
length of her spine

Im going to Broome Haughton she announced to Joan

When Joan inquired

At the end of the week I am invited for a fortnight

Am I going Joan asked

No You will go to London to meet some friends who are coming over from
Paris

Joan knew that comment was unnecessary Both she and her mother were on
intimate terms with these hypothetical friends who so frequently
turned up from Paris or elsewhere when it was necessary that she should
suddenly go back to London and live in squalid seclusion in the unopened
house with a charwoman to provide her with underdone or burnt chops
and eggs at eighteen a shilling while the shutters of the front rooms
were closed and dusty desolation reigned She knew every detail of the
melancholy squalor of it the dragging hours the nights of lying awake
listening to the occasional passing of belated cabs or the squeaks and
nibbling of mice in the old walls

If you had conducted yourself sensibly you need not have gone
continued her mother I could have made an excuse and left you here
You would at least have been sure of good food and decent comforts

After your visit are we to return here was Lady Joans sole reply

Dont look at me like that said Lady Mallowe I thought the country
would freshen your color at least but you are going off more every day
You look like the Witch of Endor sometimes

Joan smiled faintly This was the brandishing of an old weapon and
she understood all its significance It meant that the time for
opportunities was slipping past her like the waters of a rapid river

I do not know what will happen when I leave Broome Haughton her
mother added a note of rasped uncertainty in her voice We may be
obliged to come here for a short time or we may go abroad

If I refuse to come would you let me starve to death in Piers Street
Joan inquired

Lady Mallowe looked her over feeling a sort of frenzy at the sight
of her In truth the future was a hideous thing to contemplate if no
rescue at all was in sight It would be worse for her than for Joan
because Joan did not care what happened or did not happen and she cared
desperately She had indeed arrived at a maddening moment

Yes she snapped fiercely

And when Joan faintly smiled again she understood why women of the lower
orders beat one another until policemen interfere She knew perfectly
well that the girl had somehow found out that Sir Moses Monaldini was to
be at Broome Haughton and that when he left there he was going
abroad She knew also that she had not been able to conceal that his
indifference had of late given her some ghastly hours and that her play
for this lagging invitation had been a frantically bold one That the
most ingenious efforts and devices had ended in success only after such
delay made it all the more necessary that no straw must remain unseized
on

I can wear some of your things with a little alteration she said
Rose will do it for me Hats and gloves and ornaments do not require
altering I shall need things you will not need in London Where are
your keys

Lady Joan rose and got them for her She even flushed slightly They
were often obliged to borrow each others possessions but for a moment
she felt herself moved by a sort of hard pity

We are like rats in a trap she remarked I hope you will get out

If I do you will be left inside Get out yourself Get out yourself
said Lady Mallowe in a fierce whisper

Her regrets at the necessity of their leaving Temple Barholm were
expressed with fluent touchingness at the dinnertable The visit had
been so delightful Mr Temple Barholm and Miss Alicia had been so kind
The loveliness of the whole dear place had so embraced them that they
felt as if they were leaving a home instead of ending a delightful
visit It was extraordinary what an effect the house had on one It was
as if one had lived in it alwaysand always would So few places
gave one the same feeling They should both look forwardgreedy as it
seemedto being allowed some time to come again She had decided from
the first that it was not necessary to go to any extreme of caution or
subtlety with her host and Miss Alicia Her method of paving the way
for future visits was perhaps more than a shade too elaborate She felt
however that it sufficed For the most part Lady Joan sat with lids
dropped over her burning eyes She tried to force herself not to
listen This was the kind of thing which made her sick with humiliation
Howsoever rudimentary these people were they could not fail to
comprehend that a foothold in the house was being bid for They should
at least see that she did not join in the bidding Her own visit had
been filled with feelings at war with one another There had been hours
too many in which she would have been gladeven with the dingy horrors
of the closed town house before herto have flown from the hundred
things which called out to her on every side In the longpast three
months of happiness Jem had described them all to herthe rooms
gardens pleached walks pictures the very furniture itself She
could enter no room walk in no spot she did not seem to know and
passionately love in spite of herself She loved them so much that there
were times when she yearned to stay in the place at any cost and others
when she could not endure the misery it woke in herthe pure misery
Now it was over for the time being and she was facing something new
There were endless varieties of wretchedness She had been watching
her mother for some months and had understood her varying moods of
temporary elation or prolonged anxiety Each one had meant some phase
of the episode of Sir Moses Monaldini The people who lived at Broome
Haughton were enormously rich Hebrews who were related to him They
had taken the beautiful old countryseat and were filling it with huge
parties of their friends The party which Lady Mallowe was to join would
no doubt offer opportunities of the most desirable kind Among this
special class of people she was a great success Her amazingly achieved
toilettes her ripe good looks her air of belonging to the great world
impressed themselves immensely

T Tembarom thought he never had seen Lady Joan look as handsome as she
looked tonight The color on her cheek burned her eyes had a driven
loneliness in them She had a wonderfully beautiful mouth and its curve
drooped in a new way He wished Ann could get her in a corner and sit
down and talk sense to her He remembered what he had said to the duke
Perhaps this was the time If she was going away and her mother meant
to drag her back again when she was ready it would make it easier for
her to leave the place knowing she need not hate to come back But the
duke wasnt making any miss hit when he said it wouldnt be easy She
was not like Ann who would feel some pity for the biggest fool on
earth if she had to throw him down hard Lady Joan would feel neither
compunctions nor relentings He knew the way she could look at a fellow
If he couldnt make her understand what he was aiming at they would
both be worse off than they would be if he left things as they were
Butthe hard line showed itself about his mouthhe wasnt going to
leave things as they were

As they passed through the hall after dinner Lady Mallowe glanced at
a sidetable on which lay some letters arrived by the late post An
imposing envelope was on the top of the rest Joan saw her face light as
she took it up

I think this is from Broome Haughton she said If you will excuse
me I will go into the library and read it It may require answering at
once

She turned hot and cold poor woman and went away so that she might
be free from the disaster of an audience if anything had gone wrong It
would be better to be alone even if things had gone right The letter
was from Sir Moses Monaldini Grotesque and ignoble as it naturally
strikes the uninitiated as seeming the situation had its touch of
hideous pathos She had fought for her own hand for years she could not
dig and to beg she was not ashamed but a time had come when even the
most adroit begging began to bore people They saw through it and then
there resulted strained relations slight stiffness of manner even in
the most useful and amiable persons lack of desire to be hospitable
or even condescendingly generous Cold shoulders were turned there
were ominous threatenings of icy backs presenting themselves The
very tradesmen had found this out and could not be persuaded that the
advertisement furnished by the fact that two beautiful women of fashion
ate drank and wore the articles which formed the items in their unpaid
bills was sufficient return for the outlay of capital required Even
Mrs Mellish when graciously approached by the relative of Miss Temple
Barholm whose perfect wardrobe you supplied had listened to all
seductions with a civil eye fixed unmovedly and had referred to the
rules of the establishment Nearer and nearer the edge of the
abyss the years had pushed them and now if something did not
happensomethingsomethingeven the increasingly shabby small house
in town would become a thing of the past And what then Could any one
wonder she said to herself that she could have beaten Joan furiously It
would not matter to any one else if they dropped out of the world
into squalid oblivionoh she knew thatshe knew that with bitter
certaintybut oh how it would matter to themat least to herself
It was all very well for Mudies to pour forth streams of sentimental
novels preaching the horrors of girls marrying for money but what were
you to dowhat in heavens name were you to do So feeling terrified
enough actually to offer up a prayer she took the imposingly addressed
letter into the library

The men had come into the drawingroom when she returned As she
entered Joan did not glance up from the book she was reading but at
the first sound of her voice she knew what had occurred

I was obliged to dash off a note to Broome Haughton so that it would
be ready for the early post Lady Mallowe said She was at her best
Palliser saw that some years had slipped from her shoulders The moment
which relieves or even promises to relieve fears does astonishing
things Tembarom wondered whether she had had good news and Miss Alicia
thought that her evening dress was more becoming than any she had ever
seen her wear before Her brilliant air of social ease returned to her
and she began to talk fluently of what was being done in London and to
touch lightly upon the possibility of taking part in great functions
For some time she had rather evaded talk of the future Palliser had
known that the future had seemed to be closing in upon her and leaving
her staring at a high blank wall Persons whose fortunate names had
ceased to fall easily from her lips appeared again upon the horizon
Miss Alicia was impressed anew with the feeling that she had known every
brilliant or important personage in the big world of social London that
she had taken part in every dazzling event Tembarom somehow realized
that she had been afraid of something or other and was for some reason
not afraid any more Such a change whatsoever the reason for it ought
to have had some effect on her daughter Surely she would share her
luck if luck had come to her

But Lady Joan sat apart and kept her eyes upon her book This was one
of the things she often chose to do in spite of her mothers indignant
protest

I came here because you brought me she would answer I did not come
to be entertaining or polite

She was reading this evening She heard every word of Lady Mallowes
agreeable and slightly excited conversation She did not know exactly
what had happened but she knew that it was something which had buoyed
her up with a hopefulness which exhilarated her almost too muchas an
extra glass of wine might have done Once or twice she even lost
her head a little and was a trifle swaggering T Tembarom would not
recognize the slip but Joan saw Pallisers faint smile without looking
up from her book He observed shades in taste and bearing Before her
own future Joan saw the blank wall of stone building itself higher and
higher If Sir Moses had capitulated she would be counted out With
what degree of boldness could a mother cast her penniless daughter on
the world What unendurable provision make for her Dare they offer a
pound a week and send her to live in the slums until she chose to marry
some Hebrew friend of her stepfathers That she knew would be the
final alternative A cruel little smile touched her lips as she
reviewed the number of things she could not do to earn her living She
could not take in sewing or washing and there was nothing she could
teach Starvation or marriage The wall built itself higher and yet
higher What a hideous thing it was for a penniless girl to be brought
up merely to be a beauty and in consequence supposably a great lady
And yet if she was born to a certain rank and had height and figure a
lovely mouth a delicate nose unusual eyes and lashes to train her to
be a dressmaker or a housemaid would be a stupid investment of capital
If nothing tragic interfered and the right man wanted such a girl she
had been trained to please him But tragic things had happened and
before her grew the wall while she pretended to read her book

T Tembarom was coming toward her She had heard Palliser suggest a game
of billiards

Will you come and play billiards with us Tembarom asked Palliser
says you play splendidly

She plays brilliantly put in Lady Mallowe Come Joan

No thank you she answered Let me stay here and read

Lady Mallowe protested She tried an air of playful maternal reproach
because she was in good spirits Joan saw Palliser smiling quietly and
there was that in his smile which suggested to her that he was thinking
her an obstinate fool

You had better show Temple Barholm what you can do he remarked This
will be your last chance as you leave so soon You ought never let a
last chance slip by I never do

Tembarom stood still and looked down at her from his good height He
did not know what Pallisers speech meant but an instinct made him feel
that it somehow held an ugly quiet taunt

What I would like to do was the unspoken crudity which passed through
his mind would be to swat him on the mouth Hes getting at her just
when she ought to be let alone

Would you like it better to stay here and read he inquired

Much better if you please was her reply

Then that goes he answered and left her

He swept the others out of the room with a goodnatured promptness which
put an end to argument When he said of anything Then that goes it
usually did so




CHAPTER XXXI


When she was alone Joan sat and gazed not at her wall but at the
pictures that came back to her out of a part of her life which seemed
to have been lived centuries ago They were the pictures that came back
continually without being called the clearness of which always startled
her afresh Sometimes she thought they sprang up to add to her torment
but sometimes it seemed as if they came to save her from herselfher
mad wicked self After all there were moments when to know that she
had been the girl whose eighteenyearold heart had leaped so when
she turned and met Jems eyes as he stood gazing at her under the
beechtree was something to cling to She had been that girl and Jem
had beenJem And she had been the girl who had joined him in that
young ardent vow that they would say the same prayers at the same hour
each night together Ah how young it had beenhow YOUNG Her throat
strained itself because sobs rose in it and her eyes were hot with the
swell of tears

She could hear voices and laughter and the click of balls from the
billiardroom Her mother and Palliser laughed the most but she knew
the sound of her mothers voice would cease soon because she would come
back to her She knew she would not leave her long and she knew the
kind of scene they would pass through together when she returned The
old things would be said the old arguments used but a new one would be
added It was a pleasant thing to wait here knowing that it was coming
and that for all her fierce pride and fierce spirit she had no defense
It was at once horrible and ridiculous that she must sit and listenand
stare at the growing wall It was as she caught her breath against the
choking swell of tears that she heard Lady Mallowe returning She came
in with an actual sweep across the room Her society air had fled and
she was unadornedly furious when she stopped before Joans chair For
a few seconds she actually glared then she broke forth in a suppressed
undertone

Come into the billiardroom I command it

Joan lifted her eyes from her book Her voice was as low as her
mothers but steadier

No she answered

Is this conduct to continue Is it Lady Mallowe panted

Yes said Joan and laid her book on the table near her There was
nothing else to say Words made things worse

Lady Mallowe had lost her head but she still spoke in the suppressed
voice

You SHALL behave yourself she cried under her breath and actually
made a passionate halfstart toward her You violentnatured virago
The very look on your face is enough to drive one mad

I know I am violentnatured said Joan But dont you think it wise
to remember that you cannot make the kind of scene here that you can in
your own house We are a badtempered pair and we behave rather
like fishwives when we are in a rage But when we are guests in other
peoples houses

Lady Mallowes temper was as elemental as any Billingsgate could
provide

You think you can take advantage of that she said Dont trust
yourself too far Do you imagine that just when all might go well for me
I will allow you to spoil everything

How can I spoil everything

By behaving as you have been behaving since we came hererefusing
to make a home for yourself by hanging round my neck so that it will
appear that any one who takes me must take you also

There are servants outside Joan warned her

You shall not stop me cried Lady Mallowe

You cannot stop yourself said Joan That is the worst of it It is
bad enough when we stand and hiss at each other in a stage whisper but
when you lose control over yourself and raise your voice

I came in here to tell you that this is your last chance I shall never
give you another Do you know how old you are

I shall soon be twentyseven Joan answered I wish I were a hundred
Then it would all be over

But it will not be over for years and years and years her mother
flung back at her Have you forgotten that the very rags you wear are
not paid for

No I have not forgotten The scene was working itself up on the old
lines as Joan had known it would Her mother never failed to say the
same things every time such a scene took place

You will get no more such ragspaid or unpaid for What do you expect
to do You dont know how to work and if you did no decent woman would
employ you You are too goodlooking and too badtempered

Joan knew she was perfectly right Knowing it she remained silent and
her silence added to her mothers helpless rage She moved a step nearer
to her and flung the javelin which she always knew would strike deep

You have made yourself a laughingstock for all London for years You
are mad about a man who disgraced and ruined himself

She saw the javelin quiver as it struck but Joans voice as it answered
her had a quality of low and deadly steadiness

You have said that a thousand times and you will say it another
thousandthough you know the story was a lie and was proved to be one

Lady Mallowe knew her way thoroughly

Who remembers the denials What the world remembers is that Jem Temple
Barholm was stamped as a cheat and a trickster No one has time to
remember the other thing He is deaddead When a mans dead its too
late

She was desperate enough to drive her javelin home deeper than she had
ever chanced to drive it before The truththe awful truth she uttered
shook Joan from head to foot She sprang up and stood before her in
heartwrung fury

Oh You are a hideously cruel woman she cried They say even tigers
care for their young But youyou can say that to _me_ When a mans
dead its too late

It _is_ too lateit IS too late Lady Mallowe persisted Why had
not she struck this note before It was breaking her will I would say
anything to bring you to your senses

Joan began to move restlessly to and fro

Oh what a fool I am she exclaimed As if you could understandas
if you could care

Struggle as she might to be defiant she was breaking Lady Mallowe
repeated to herself She followed her as a hunter might have followed a
young leopardess with a wound in its flank

I came here because it _is_ your last chance Palliser knew what he was
saying when he made a joke of it just now He knew it wasnt a joke You
might have been the Duchess of Merthshire you might have been Lady St
Maur with a husband with millions And here you are You know whats
before youwhen I am out of the trap

Joan laughed It was a wild little laugh and she felt there was no
sense in it

I might apply for a place in Miss Alicias Home for Decayed
Gentlewomen she said

Lady Mallowe nodded her head fiercely

Apply then There will be no place for you in the home I am going to
live in she retorted

Joan ceased moving about She was about to hear the one argument that
was new

You may as well tell me she said wearily

I have had a letter from Sir Moses Monaldini He is to be at Broome
Haughton He is going there purposely to meet me What he writes can
mean only one thing He means to ask me to marry him Im your mother
and Im nearly twenty years older than you but you see that Im out of
the trap first

I knew you would be answered Joan

He detests you Lady Mallowe went on He will not hear of your living
with usor even near us He says you are old enough to take care of
yourself Take my advice I am doing you a good turn in giving it This
New York newsboy is mad over you If he hadnt been we should have been
bundled out of the house before this He never has spoken to a lady
before in his life and he feels as if you were a goddess Go into
the billiardroom this instant and do all a woman can Go And she
actually stamped her foot on the carpet

Joans thundercolored eyes seemed to grow larger as she stared at her
Her breast lifted itself and her face slowly turned pale Perhapsshe
thought it wildlypeople sometimes did die of feelings like this

He would crawl at your feet her mother went on pursuing what she
felt sure was her advantage She was so sure of it that she added words
only a fool or a woman half hysteric with rage would have added You
might live in the very house you would have lived in with Jem Temple
Barholm on the income he could have given you

She saw the crassness of her blunder the next moment If she had had
an advantage she had lost it Wickedly without a touch of mirth Joan
laughed in her face

Jems house and Jems moneyand the New York newsboy in his shoes
she flung at her T Tembarom to live with until one lay down on ones
deathbed T Tembarom

Suddenly something was giving way in her Lady Mallowe thought again
Joan slipped into a chair and dropped her head and hidden face on the
table

Oh Mother Mother she ended Oh Jem Jem

Was she sobbing or trying to choke sobbing back There was no time to be
lost Her mother had never known a scene to end in this way before

Crying there was absolute spite in her voice That shows you know
what you are in for at all events But Ive said my last word What
does it matter to me after all Youre in the trap Im not Get out as
best you can Ive done with you

She turned her back and went out of the roomas she had come into
itwith a sweep Joan would have smiled at as rather vulgar if she had
seen it As a child in the nursery she had often seen that her ladyship
was vulgar

But she did not see the sweep because her face was hidden Something in
her had broken this time as her mother had felt That bitter sordid
truth driven home as it had been had done it Who had time to remember
denials or lies proved to be lies Nobody in the world Who had time to
give to the defense of a dead man There was not time enough to give to
living ones It was truetrue When a man is dead it is too late The
wall had built itself until it reached her sky but it was not the wall
she bent her head and sobbed over It was that suddenly she had seen
again Jems face as he had stood with slowgrowing pallor and looked
round at the ring of eyes which stared at him Jems face as he strode
by her without a glance and went out of the room She forgot everything
else on earth She forgot where she was She was eighteen again and she
sobbed in her arms as eighteen sobs when its heart is torn from it

Oh Jem Jem she cried If you were only in the same world with me
If you were just in the same world

She had forgotten all else indeed She forgot too long She did not
know how long It seemed that no more than a few minutes had passed
before she was without warning struck with the shock of feeling that
some one was in the room with her standing near her looking at her
She had been mad not to remember that exactly this thing would be sure
to happen by some abominable chance Her movement as she rose was
almost violent she could not hold herself still and her face was
horribly wet with shameless unconcealable tears Shameless she felt
themindecenta sort of nudity of the soul If it had been a servant
who had intruded or if it had been Palliser it would have been
intolerable enough But it was T Tembarom who confronted her with his
common face moved mysteriously by some feeling she resented even more
than she resented his presence He was too grossly ignorant to know that
a man of breeding having entered by chance would have turned and gone
away professing not to have seen He seemed to thinkthe doltthat
he must make some apology

Say Lady Joan he began I beg your pardon I didnt want to butt
in

Then go away she commanded Instantlyinstantly

She knew he must see that she spoke almost through her teeth in her
effort to control her sobbing breath But he made no move toward leaving
her He even drew nearer looking at her in a sort of meditative
obstinate way

Nno he replied deliberately I guessI wont

You wont Lady Joan repeated after him Then I will

He made a stride forward and laid his hand on her arm

No Not on your life You wont eitherif I can help it And youre
going to LET me help it

Almost any one but herselfany one at least who did not resent his
very existencewould have felt the drop in his voice which suddenly
struck the note of boyish friendly appeal in the last sentence Youre
going to LET me he repeated

She stood looking down at the daring unconscious hand on her arm

I suppose she said with cutting slowness that you do not even
_know_ that you are insolent Take your hand away in arrogant command

He removed it with an unabashed halfsmile

I beg your pardon he said I didnt even know Id put it there It
was a breakbut I wanted to keep you

That he not only wanted to keep her but intended to do so was apparent
His air was neither rough nor brutal but he had ingeniously placed
himself in the outlet between the big table and the way to the door He
put his hands in his pockets in his vulgar unconscious way and watched
her

Say Lady Joan he broke forth in the frank outburst of a man who
wants to get something over I should be a fool if I didnt see that
youre up against ithard Whats the matter His voice dropped again

There was something in the drop this time whichperhaps because of her
recent emotionsounded to her almost as if he were asking the question
with the protecting sympathy of the tone one would use in speaking to
a child How dare he But it came home to her that Jem had once said
Whats the matter to her in the same way

Do you think it likely that I should confide in you she said and
inwardly quaked at the memory as she said it

No he answered considering the matter gravely Its not likelythe
way things look to you now But if you knew me better perhaps it would
be likely

I once explained to you that I do not intend to know you better she
gave answer

He nodded acquiescently

Yes I got on to that And its because its up to me that I came out
here to tell you something I want you to know before you go away Im
going to confide in you

Cannot even you see that I am not in the mood to accept confidences
she exclaimed

Yes I can But youre going to accept this one steadily No as
she made a swift movement Im not going to clear the way till Ive
done

I insist she cried If you were

He put out his hand but not to touch her

I know what youre going to say If I were a gentlemanWell Im not
laying claim to thatbut Im a sort of a man anyhow though you maynt
think it And youre going to listen

She began to stare at him It was not the ridiculous boyish drop in his
voice which arrested her attention It was a fantastic incongruous
wholly different thing He had suddenly dropped his slouch and stood
upright Did he realize that he had slung his words at her as if they
were an order given with the ring of authority

Ive not bucked against anything youve said or done since youve been
here he went on speaking fast and grimly I didnt mean to I had my
reasons There were things that Id have given a good deal to say to
you and ask you about but you wouldnt let me You wouldnt give me a
chance to square things for youif they could be squared You threw me
down every time I tried

He was too wildly incomprehensible with his changes from humanness
to folly Remembering what he had attempted to say on the day he had
followed her in the avenue she was inflamed again

What in the name of New York slang does that mean she demanded

Never mind New York he answered cool as well as grim A fellow
thats learned slang in the streets has learned something else as well
Hes learned to keep his eyes open Hes on to a way of seeing things
And what Ive seen is that youre so doggone miserable thatthat youre
almost down and out

This time she spoke to him in the voice with the quality of deadliness
in it which she had used to her mother

Do you think that because you are in your own house you can be as
intrusively insulting as you choose she said

No I dont he answered What I think is quite different I think
that if a man has a house of his own and theres any one in big trouble
under the roof of ita woman most of allhes a cheap skate if he
dont get busy and try to helpjust plain straight help

He saw in her eyes all her concentrated disdain of him but he went on
still obstinate and cool and grim

I guess help is too big a word just yet That may come later and it
maynt What Im going to try at now is making it easier for youjust
easier

Her contemptuous gesture registered no impression on him as he paused a
moment and looked fixedly at her

You just hate me dont you It was a mere statement which couldnt
have been more impersonal to himself if he had been made of wood
Thats all right I seem like a lowdown intruder to you Well thats
all right too But what aint all right is what your mother has set
you on to thinking about me Youd never have thought it yourself Youd
have known better

What fiercely is that

That Im mutt enough to have a mash on you

The common slangy crassness of it was a kind of shock She caught her
breath and merely stared at him But he was not staring at her he was
simply looking straight into her face and it amazingly flashed upon her
that the extraordinary words were so entirely unembarrassed and direct
that they were actually not offensive

He was merely telling her something in his own way not caring the least
about his own effect but absolutely determined that she should hear and
understand it

Her caught breath ended in something which was like a halflaugh His
queer sharp incomprehensible face his queer unmoved voice were too
extraordinarily unlike anything she had ever seen or heard before

I dont want to be brashand what I want to say may seem kind of that
way to you But it aint Anyhow I guess itll relieve your mind Lady
Joan youre a lookeryoure a beaut from Beautville If I were your
kind and things were different Id be crazy about youcrazy But Im
not your kindand things are different He drew a step nearer still to
her in his intentness Theyre this different Why Lady Joan Im dead
stuck on another girl

She caught her breath again leaning forward

Another

She says shes not a lady she threw me down just because all
this darned money came to me he hastened on and suddenly he was
imperturbable no longer but flushed and boyish and more of New York
than ever Shes a little bit of a quiet thing and she drops her hs
but gee Youre a lookeryoure a queen and shes not But Little
Ann HutchinsonWhy Lady Joan as far as this boys concernedand
he oddly touched himself on the breastshe makes you look like thirty
cents

Joan quickly sat down on the chair she had just left She rested an
elbow on the table and shaded her face with her hand She was not
laughing she scarcely knew what she was doing or feeling

You are in love with Ann Hutchinson she said in a low voice

Am I he answered hotly Well I should smile He disdained to say
more

Then she began to know what she felt There came back to her in flashes
scenes from the past weeks in which she had done her worst by him in
which she had swept him aside loathed him set her feet on him used
the devices of an ingenious demon to discomfit and show him at his
poorest and least ready And he had not been giving a thought to the
thing for which she had striven to punish him And he plainly did not
even hate her His mind was clear as water is clear He had come back
to her this evening to do her a good turna good turn Knowing what
she was capable of in the way of arrogance and villainous temper he had
determined to do herin spite of herselfa good turn

I dont understand you she faltered

I know you dont But its only because Im so dead easy to understand
Theres nothing to find out Im just friendlyfriendlythats all

You would have been friends with me she exclaimed You would have
told me and I wouldnt let you Oh with an impulsive flinging out of
her hand to him you goodgood fellow

Good be darned he answered taking the hand at once

You are good to tell me I have behaved like a devil to you But oh if
you only knew

His face became mature again but he took a most informal seat on the
edge of the table near her

I do knowpart of it Thats why Ive been trying to be friends with
you all the time He said his next words deliberately If I was the
woman Jem Temple Barholm had loved wouldnt it have driven me mad to
see another man in his placeand remember what was done to him I never
even saw him but good God she saw his hand clench itselfwhen
I think of it I want to kill somebody I want to kill half a dozen Why
didnt they know it couldnt be true of a fellow like that

She sat up stiffly and watched him

Doyoufeel like thatabout him

Do I redhotly There were men there that knew him There were women
there that knew him Why wasnt there just one to stand by him A man
thats been square all his life doesnt turn into a cardsharp in a
night Damn fools I beg your pardon hastily And then as hastily
again No I mean it Damn fools

Oh she gasped just once

Her passionate eyes were suddenly blinded with tears She caught at his
clenched hand and dragged it to her letting her face drop on it and
crying like a child

The way he took her utter breaking down was just like him and like no
one else He put the other hand on her shoulder and spoke to her exactly
as he had spoken to Miss Alicia on that first afternoon

Dont you mind me Lady Joan he said Dont you mind me a bit Ill
turn my back Ill go into the billiardroom and keep them playing until
you get away upstairs Now we understand each other itll be better
for both of us

No dont go Dont she begged It is so wonderful to find some one
who sees the cruelty of it She spoke fast and passionately No one
would listen to any defense of him My mother simply raved when I said
what you are saying

Do you want he put it to her with a curious comprehending of her
emotionto talk about him Would it do you good

Yes Yes I have never talked to any one There has been no one to
listen

Talk all you want he answered with immense gentleness Im here

I cant understand it even now but he would not see me she broke
out I was half mad I wrote and he would not answer I went to his
chambers when I heard he was going to leave England I went to beg him
to take me with him married or unmarried I would have gone on my knees
to him He was gone Oh why Why

You didnt think hed gone because he didnt love you he put it to
her quite literally and unsentimentally You knew better than that

How could I be sure of anything When he left the room that awful night
he would not look at me He would not look at me

Since Ive been here Ive been reading a lot of novels and Ive found
out a lot of things about fellows that are not the common practical
kind Now he wasnt Hed lived pretty much like a fellow in a novel I
guess Whats struck me about that sort is that they think they have to
make noble sacrifices and theyll just walk all over a woman because
they wont do anything to hurt her Theres not a bit of sense in it
but that was what he was doing He believed he was doing the square
thing by youand you may bet your life it hurt him like hell I beg
your pardonbut thats the wordjust plain hell

I was only a girl He was like iron He went away alone He was killed
and when he was dead the truth was told

Thats what Ive remembered quite slowlyevery time Ive looked at
you By gee Id have stood anything from a woman that had suffered as
much as that

It made her cryhis genuinenessand she did not care in the least that
the tears streamed down her cheeks How he had stood things How he had
borne in that odd unimpressive way insolence and arrogance for which
she ought to have been beaten and blackballed by decent society She
could scarcely bear it

Oh to think it should have been you she wept just you who
understood

Well he answered speculatively I mightnt have understood as
well if it hadnt been for Ann By jings I used to lie awake at night
sometimes thinking supposing it bad been Ann and me Id sort of
work it out as it might have happened in New Yorkat the office of the
Sunday Earth Supposing some fellow thatd had a grouch against me had
managed it so that Galton thought Id been getting away with money that
didnt belong to mefixing up my expense account or worse And Galton
wouldnt listen to what I said and fired me and I couldnt get a job
anywhere else because I was down and out for good And nobody would
listen And I was killed without clearing myself And Little Ann was
left to stand itLittle Ann Old Hutchinson wouldnt listen I
know that And it would be all shut up burning in her big little
heartburning And T T dead and not a word to say for himself
Jehoshaphattaking out his handkerchief and touching his
foreheadit used to make the cold sweat start out on me Its doing it
now Ann and me might have been Jem and you Thats why I understood

He put out his hand and caught hers and frankly squeezed itsqueezed it
hard and the unconventional clutch was a wonderful thing to her

Its all right now aint it he said Weve got it straightened out
Youll not be afraid to come back here if your mother wants you to He
stopped for a moment and then went on with something of hesitation We
dont want to talk about your mother We cant But I understand her
too Folks are different from each other in their ways Shes different
from you IllIll straighten it out with her if you like

Nothing will need straightening out after I tell her that you are going
to marry Little Ann Hutchinson said Joan with a halfsmile And that
you were engaged to her before you saw me

Well that does sort of finish things up doesnt it said T
Tembarom

He looked at her so speculatively for a moment after this that she
wondered whether he had something more to say He had

Theres something I want to ask you he ventured

Ask anything

Do you know any onejust any onewho has a photojust any old
photoof Jem Temple Barholm

She was rather puzzled

Yes I know a woman who has worn one for nearly eight years Do you
want to see it

Id give a good deal to was his answer

She took a flat locket from her dress and handed it to him

Women dont wear lockets in these days He could barely hear her voice
because it was so low But Ive never taken it off I want him near my
heart Its Jem

He held it on the palm of his hand and stood under the light studying
it as if he wanted to be sure he wouldnt forget it

Itssorter like that picture of Miles Hugo aint it he suggested

Yes People always said so That was why you found me in the
picturegallery the first time we met

I knew that was the reasonand I knew Id made a break when I butted
in he answered Then still looking at the photograph Youd know
this face again most anywhere you saw it I guess

There are no faces like it anywhere said Joan

I guess thats so he replied And its one that wouldnt change much
either Thank you Lady Joan

He handed back the picture and she put out her hand again

I think Ill go to my room now she said Youve done a strange
thing to me Youve taken nearly all the hatred and bitterness out of my
heart I shall want to come back here whether my mother comes or notI
shall want to

The sooner the quicker he said And so long as Im here Ill be
ready and waiting

Dont go away she said softly I shall need you

Isnt that great he cried flushing delightedly Isnt it just great
that weve got things straightened so that you can say that Gee This
is a queer old world Theres such a lot to do in it and so few hours
in the day Seems like there aint time to stop long enough to hate
anybody and keep a grouch on A fellows got to keep hustling not to
miss the things worth while

The liking in her eyes was actually wistful

Thats your way of thinking isnt it she said Teach it to me if
you can I wish you could Goodnight She hesitated a second God
bless you she added quite suddenlyalmost fantastic as the words
sounded to her That she Joan Fayre should be calling down devout
benisons on the head of T TembaromT Tembarom

Her mother was in her room when she reached it She had come up early to
look over her possessionsand Joansbefore she began her packing
The bed the chairs and tables were spread with evening morning
and walkingdresses and the millinery collected from their combined
wardrobes She was examining anxiously a lace appliqued and embroidered
white coat and turned a slightly flushed face toward the opening door

I am going over your things as well as my own she said I shall take
what I can use You will require nothing in London You will require
nothing anywhere in future What is the matter she said sharply as
she saw her daughters face

Joan came forward feeling it a strange thing that she was not in the
mood to fightto lash out and be glad to do it

Captain Palliser told me as I came up that Mr Temple Barholm had been
talking to you her mother went on He heard you having some sort of
scene as he passed the door As you have made your decision of course I
know I neednt hope that anything has happened

What has happened has nothing to do with my decision He wasnt waiting
for that Joan answered her We were both entirely mistaken Mother

What are you talking about cried Lady Mallowe but she temporarily
laid the white coat on a chair What do you mean by mistaken

He doesnt want mehe never did Joan answered again A shadow of
a smile hovered over her face and there was no derision in it only a
warming recollection of his earnestness when he had said the words she
quoted He is what they call in New York dead stuck on another girl

Lady Mallowe sat down on the chair that held the white coat and she did
not push the coat aside

He told you that in his vulgar slang she gasped it out Youyou
ought to have struck him dead with your answer

Except poor Jem Temple Barholm was the amazing reply she received
he is the only friend I ever had in my life




CHAPTER XXXII


It was business of serious importance which was to bring Captain
Pallisers visit to a close He explained it perfectly to Miss Alicia a
day or so after Lady Mallowe and her daughter left them He had lately
been most amiable in his manner toward Miss Alicia and had given
her much valuable information about companies and stocks He rather
unexpectedly found it imperative that he should go to London and Berlin
to see peopledealers in great financial schemes who were deeply
interested in solid business speculations such as his own which were
fundamentally different from all others in the impeccable firmness of
their foundations

I suppose he will be very rich some day Miss Alicia remarked the
first morning she and T Tembarom took their breakfast alone together
after his departure It would frighten me to think of having as much
money as he seems likely to have quite soon

It would scare me to death said Tembarom She knew he was making
a sort of joke but she thought the point of it was her tremor at the
thought of great fortune

He seemed to think that it would be an excellent thing for you to
invest inIm not sure whether it was the India Rubber Tree Company
or the mahogany forests or the copper mines that have so much gold and
silver mixed in them that it will pay for the expense of the digging
she went on

I guess it was the whole lot put in Tembarom

Perhaps it was They are all going to make everybody so rich that it is
quite bewildering He is very clever in business matters And so kind
He even said that if I really wished it he might be able to invest my
income for me and actually treble it in a year But of course I told him
that my income was your generous gift to me and that it was far more
than sufficient for my needs

Tembarom put down his coffeecup so suddenly to look at her that she
was fearful that she had appeared to do Captain Palliser some vague
injustice

I am sure he meant to be most obliging dear she explained I was
really quite touched He said most sympathetically and delicately that
when women were unmarried and unaccustomed to investment sometimes a
business man could be of use to them He forgotaffectionatelythat
I had you

Tembarom regarded her with tender curiosity She often opened up vistas
for him as he himself opened them for the Duke of Stone

If you hadnt had me would you have let him treble your income in a
year he asked

Her expression was that of a soft woodland rabbit or a trusting
spinster dove

Well of course if one were quite alone in the world and had only a
small income it would be nice to have it wonderfully added to in such
a short time she answered But it was his friendly solicitude which
touched me I have not been accustomed to such interested delicacy on
the part ofof gentlemen Her hesitance before the last word being the
result of training which had made her feel that it was a little bold
for ladies to refer quite openly to gentlemen

You sometimes read in the newspapers said Tembarom buttering his
toast about ladies who are all alone in the world with a little
income but theyre not often left alone with it long Its like you
saidyouve got me but if the time ever comes when you havent got me
just you make a deadsure thing of it that you dont let any solicitous
business gentleman treble your income in a year If its an income that
comes to more than five cents dont you hand it over to be made into
fifteen Five cents is a heap betterjust plain five

Temple gasped Miss Alicia Youyou surely cannot mean that you do
not think Captain Palliser issincere

Tembarom laughed outright his most hilarious and comforting laugh He
had no intention of enlightening her in such a manner as would lead her
at once to behold pictures of him as the possible victim of appalling
catastrophes He liked her too well as she was

Sincere he said Hes sincere down to the groundin what hes
reaching after But hes not going to treble your income nor mine If
he ever makes that offer again you just tell him Im interested and
that Ill talk it over with him

I could not help saying to him that I didnt think you could want any
more money when you had so much she added but he said one never knew
what might happen He was greatly interested when I told him you had
once said the very same thing yourself

Their breakfast was at an end and he got up laughing again as he
came to her end of the table and put his arm around her shoulders in the
unconventional young caress she adored him for

Its nice to be by ourselves again for a while he said Let us go
for a walk together Put on the little bonnet and dress that are the
color of a mouse Those little duds just get me You look so pretty in
them

The sixteenyearold blush ran up to the roots of her gray
sideringlets Just imagine his remembering the color of her dress and
bonnet and thinking that anything could make her look pretty She was
overwhelmed with innocent and grateful confusion There really was no
one else in the least like him

You do look well maam Rose said when she helped her to dress
Youve got such a nice color and that tiny bit of old rose Mrs
Mellish put in the bonnet does bring it out

I wonder if it is wrong of me to be so pleased Miss Alicia thought
I must make it a subject of prayer and ask to be aided to conquer a
haughty and vainglorious spirit

She was pathetically serious having been trained to a view of the
Great First Cause as figuratively embodied in the image of a gigantic
irascible omnipotent old gentleman especially wrought to fury by
feminine follies connected with becoming headgear

It has sometimes even seemed to me that our Heavenly Father has a
special objection to ladies she had once timorously confessed to
Tembarom I suppose it is because we are so much weaker than men and
so much more given to vanity and petty vices

He had caught her in his arms and actually hugged her that time Their
intimacy had reached the point where the affectionate outburst did not
alarm her

Say he had laughed Its not the men who are going to have the
biggest pull with the authorities when folks try to get into the place
where things are evened up What Im going to work my passage with is a
list of the few ladies Ive known You and Ann will be at the head
of it I shall just slide it in at the boxoffice window and say Just
look over this will you These were friends of mine and they were
mighty good to me I guess if they didnt turn me down you neednt I
know theyre in here Reserved seats Im not expecting to be put with
them but if Im allowed to hang around where they are thatll be heaven
enough for me

I know you dont mean to be irreverent dear Temple she gasped I am
quite sure you dont It isit is only your American way of expressing
your kind thoughts And of coursequite hastilythe Almighty must
understand Americansas he made so many And half frightened though
she was she patted his arm with the warmth of comfort in her soul and
moisture in her eyes Somehow or other he was always so comforting

He held her arm as they took their walk She had become used to that
also and no longer thought it odd It was only one of the ways he had
of making her feel that she was being taken care of They had not been
able to have many walks together since the arrival of the visitors and
this occasion was at once a cause of relief and inward rejoicing The
entire truth was that she had not been altogether happy about him of
late Sometimes when he was not talking and saying amusing New York
things which made people laugh he seemed almost to forget where he was
and to be thinking of something which baffled and tried him The way
in which he pulled himself together when he realized that any one was
looking at him was to her mind the most disturbing feature of his fits
of abstraction It suggested that if he really had a trouble it was a
private one on which he would not like her to intrude Naturally her
adoring eyes watched him oftener than he knew and she tried to find
plausible and not too painful reasons for his mood He always made light
of his unaccustomedness to his new life but perhaps it made him feel
more unrestful than he would admit

As they walked through the park and the village her heart was greatly
warmed by the way in which each person they met greeted him They
greeted no one else in the same way and yet it was difficult to explain
what the difference was They liked himreally liked him though how he
had overcome their natural distrust of his newsboy and bootblack record
no one but himself knew In fact she had reason to believe that even he
himself did not knowhad indeed never asked himself They had gradually
begun to like him though none of them had ever accused him of being
a gentleman according to their own acceptance of the word Every man
touched his cap or forehead with a friendly grin which spread itself the
instant he caught sight of him Grin and salute were synchronous It was
as if there were some extremely human joke between them Miss Alicia had
delightedly remembered a remark the Duke of Stone had made to her on his
return from one of their long drives

He is the most popular man in the county he had chuckled If war
broke out and he were in the army he could raise a regiment at his own
gates which would follow him wheresoever he chose to lead itif it were
into hottest Hades

Tembarom was rather silent during the first part of their walk and when
he spoke it was of Captain Palliser

Hes a fellow thats got lots of curiosity I guess hes asked you more
questions than hes asked me he began at last and he looked at her
interestedly though she was not aware of it

I thought she hesitated slightly because she did not wish to be
criticalI sometimes thought he asked me too many

What was he trying to get on to mostly

He asked so many things about you and your life in New Yorkbut more
I think about you and Mr Strangeways He was really quite persistent
once or twice about poor Mr Strangeways

What did he ask

He asked if I had seen him and if you had preferred that I should
not He calls him your Mystery and thinks your keeping him here is so
extraordinary

I guess it isthe way hed look at it Tembarom dropped in

He was so anxious to find out what he looked like He asked how old
he was and how tall and whether he was quite mad or only a little
and where you picked him up and when and what reason you gave for not
putting him in some respectable asylum I could only say that I really
knew nothing about him and that I hadnt seen him because he had a
dread of strangers and I was a little timid

She hesitated again

I wonder she said still hesitating even after her pause I wonder
if I ought to mention a rather rude thing I saw him do twice

Yes you ought Tembarom answered promptly Ive a reason for wanting
to know

It was such a singular thing to doin the circumstances she went on
obediently He knew as we all know that Mr Strangeways must not
be disturbed One afternoon I saw him walk slowly backward and forward
before the west room window He had something in his hand and kept
looking up That was what first attracted my attentionhis queer way of
looking up Quite suddenly he threw something which rattled on the
panes of glassit sounded like gravel or small pebbles I couldnt help
believing he thought Mr Strangeways would be startled into coming to
the window

Tembarom cleared his throat

He did that twice he said Pearson caught him at it though Palliser
didnt know he did Hed have done it three times or more than that
perhaps but I casually mentioned in the smokingroom one night
that some curious fool of a gardener boy had thrown some stones and
frightened Strangeways and that Pearson and I were watching for him
and that if I caught him I was going to knock his block offbing He
didnt do it again Darned fool What does he think hes after

I am afraid he is ratherI hope it is not wrong to say sobut he
is rather given to gossip And I dare say that the temptation to find
something quite new to talk about was a great one So few new things
happen in the neighborhood and as the duke says people are so
boredand he is bored himself

Hell be more bored if he tries it again when he comes back remarked
Tembarom

Miss Alicias surprised expression made him laugh

Do you think he will come back she exclaimed After such a long
visit

Oh yes hell come back Hell come back as often as he can until hes
got a chunk of my income to trebleor until Ive done with him

Until youve done with him dear inquiringly

Oh wellcasuallyIve a sort of idea that he may tell me
something Id like to know Im not sure Im only guessing But even if
he knows it he wont tell me until he gets good and ready and thinks I
dont want to hear it What he thinks hes going to get at by prowling
around is something he can get me in the crack of the door with

Templeimploringlyare you afraid he wishes to do you an injury

No Im not afraid Im just waiting to see him take a chance on it
and he gave her arm an affectionate squeeze against his side He was
always immensely moved by her little alarms for him They reminded
him in a remote way of Little Ann coming down Mrs Bowses staircase
bearing with her the tartan comforter

How could any onehow could any one want to do him an injury she began
to protest pathetically But he would not let her go on He would not
talk any more of Captain Palliser or allow her to talk of him Indeed
her secret fear was that he really knew something he did not wish her
to be troubled by and perhaps thought he had said too much He began
to make jokes and led her to other subjects He asked her to go to the
Hibblethwaites cottage and pay a visit to Tummas He had learned to
understand his accepted privileges in making of cottage visits by this
time and when he clicked any wicketgate the door was open before he
had time to pass up the wicketpath They called at several cottages
and he nodded at the windows of others where faces appeared as he passed
by

They had a happy morning together and he took her back to Temple
Barholm beaming and forgetting Captain Pallisers existence for the
time at least In the afternoon they drove out together and after
dining they read the last copy of the Sunday Earth which had arrived
that day He found quite an interesting paragraph about Mr Hutchinson
and the invention Little Miss Hutchinson was referred to most
flatteringly by the writer who almost inferred that she was responsible
not only for the inventor but for the invention itself Miss Alicia felt
quite proud of knowing so prominent a character and wondered what it
could be like to read about oneself in a newspaper

About nine oclock he laid his sheet of the Earth down and spoke to her

Im going to ask you to do me a favor he said I couldnt ask it if
we werent alone like this I know you wont mind

Of course she wouldnt mind She was made happier by the mere idea of
doing something for him

Im going to ask you to go to your room rather early he explained
I want to try a sort of stunt on Strangeways Im going to bring him
downstairs if hell come Im not sure I can get him to do it but hes
been a heap better lately and perhaps I can

Is he so much better as that she said Will it be safe

He looked as serious as she had ever seen him lookeven a trifle more
serious

I dont know how much better he is was his answer Sometimes youd
think he was almost all right And then The doctor says that if he
could get over being afraid of leaving his room it would be a big thing
for him He wants him to go to his place in London so that he can watch
him

Do you think you could persuade him to go

Ive tried my level best but so farnothing doing

He got up and stood before the mantel his back against it his hands in
his pockets

Ive found out one thing he said Hes used to houses like this
Every now and again he lets something out quite natural He knew that
the furniture in his room was Jacobeanthats what he called itand
he knew it was fine stuff He wouldnt have known that if hed been a
piker Im going to try if he wont let out something else when he sees
things hereif hell come

You have such a wonderfully reasoning mind dear said Miss Alicia as
she rose You would have made a great detective Im sure

If Ann had been with him he said rather gloomily shed have caught
on to a lot more than I have I dont feel very chesty about the way
Ive managed it

Miss Alicia went upstairs shortly afterward and half an hour later
Tembarom told the footmen in the hall that they might go to bed The
experiment he was going to make demanded that the place should be
cleared of any disturbing presence He had been thinking it over
for sometime past He had sat in the private room of the great nerve
specialist in London and had talked it over with him He had talked of
it with the duke on the lawn at Stone Hover There had been a flush of
color in the older mans cheekbones and his eyes had been alight as
he took his part in the discussion He had added the touch of his own
personality to it as always happened

We are having some fine moments my good fellow he had said rubbing
his hands This is extremely like the fourth act Id like to be sure
what comes next

Id like to be sure myself Tembarom answered Its as if a flash of
lightning came sometimes and then things clouded up And sometimes
when I am trying something out hell get so excited that I darent go on
until Ive talked to the doctor

It was the excitement he was dubious about tonight It was not possible
to be quite certain as to the entire safety of the plan but there might
be a chanceeven a big chanceof wakening some cell from its deadened
sleep Sir Ormsby way had talked to him a good deal about brain cells
and he had listened faithfully and learned more than he could put into
scientific English Gradually during the past months he had been
coming upon strangely exciting hints of curious possibilities They
had been mere hints at first and had seemed almost absurd in their
unbelievableness But each one had linked itself with another and
led him on to further wondering and exploration When Miss Alicia and
Palliser had seen that he looked absorbed and baffled it had been
because he had frequently found himself to use his own figures of
speech mixed up to beat the band He had not known which way to turn
but he had gone on turning because he could not escape from his own
excited interest and the inevitable emotion roused by being caught in
the whirl of a melodrama That was what hed dropped intoa whacking
big play It had begun for him when Palford butted in that night and
told him he was a lost heir with a fortune and an estate in England
and the curtain had been jerking up and down ever since But there had
been thrills in it queer as it was Something doing all the time by
gee

He sat and smoked his pipe and wished Ann were with him because he knew
he was not as cool as he had meant to be He felt a certain tingling
of excitement in his body and this was not the time to be excited
He waited for some minutes before he went upstairs It was true that
Strangeways had been much better lately He had seemed to find it easier
to follow conversation During the past few days Tembarom had talked to
him in a matteroffact way about the house and its various belongings
He had at last seemed to waken to an interest in the picturegallery
Evidently he knew something of picturegalleries and portraits and
found himself relieved by his own clearness of thought when he talked of
them

I feel better he said two or three times Things seem
clearernearer

Good business exclaimed Tembarom I told you itd be that way Lets
hold on to pictures It wont be any time before youll be remembering
where youve seen some

He had been secretly rather strung up but he had been very gradual in
approaching his final suggestion that some night when everything was
quiet they might go and look at the gallery together

What you need is to get out of the way of wanting to stay in one
place he argued The doctor says youve got to have a change and
even going from one room to another is a fine thing

Strangeways had looked at him anxiously for a few moments even
suspiciously but his face had cleared after the look He drew himself
up and passed his hand over his forehead

I believeperhaps he is right he murmured

Sure hes right said Tembarom Hes the sort of chap who ought to
know Hes been made into a baronet for knowing Sir Ormsby Galloway by
jings Thats no slouch of a name Oh he knows you bet your life

This morning when he had seen him he had spoken of the plan again The
visitors had gone away the servants could be sent out of sight and
hearing they could go into the library and smoke and he could look at
the books And then they could take a look at the picturegallery if he
wasnt too tired It would be a change anyhow

Tonight as he went up the huge staircase Tembaroms calmness of being
had not increased He was aware of a quickened pulse and of a slight
dampness on his forehead The dead silence of the house added to the
unusualness of things He could not remember ever having been so anxious
before except on the occasion when he had taken his first days stuff
to Galton and had stood watching him as he read it His forehead had
grown damp then But he showed no outward signs of excitement when he
entered the room and found Strangeways standing perfectly attired in
evening dress

Pearson setting things in order at the other side of the room was
taking note of him furtively over his shoulder Quite in the casual
manner of the ordinary man he had expressed his intention of dressing
for the evening and Pearson had thanked his stars for the fact that the
necessary garments were at hand From the first he had not infrequently
asked for articles such as only the resources of a complete masculine
wardrobe could supply and on one occasion he had suddenly wished to
dress for dinner and the lame excuses it had been necessary to make
had disturbed him horribly instead of pacifying him To explain that his
condition precluded the necessity of the usual appurtenances would have
been out of the question He had been angry What did Pearson mean What
was the matter He had said it over and over again and then had
sunk into a hopelessly bewildered mood and had sat huddled in his
dressinggown staring at the fire Pearson had been so harrowed by the
situation that it had been his own idea to suggest to his master that
all possible requirements should be provided There were occasions when
it appeared that the cloud over him lifted for a passing moment and a
gleam of light recalled to him some familiar usage of his past When he
had finished dressing Pearson had been almost startled by the amount of
effect produced by the straight correctly cut lines of black and white
The mere change of clothes had suddenly changed the man himselfhad
done something to him Pearson put it After his first glance at the
mirror he had straightened himself as if recognizing the fault of his
own carriage When he crossed the room it was with the action of a man
who has been trained to move well The good looks which had been
almost hidden behind a veil of uncertainty of expression and strained
fearfulness became obvious He was tall and his lean limbs were
splendidly hung together His head was perfectly set and the bearing
of his square shoulders was a soldierly thing It was an extraordinarily
handsome man Tembarom and Pearson found themselves gazing at Each
glanced involuntarily at the other

Now thats firstrate Im glad you feel like coming Tembarom plunged
in He didnt intend to give him too much time to think

Thank you It will be a change as you said Strangeways answered
One needs change

His deep eyes looked somewhat deeper than usual but his manner was
that of any wellbred man doing an accustomed thing If he had been an
ordinary guest in the house and his host had dropped into his room he
would have comported himself in exactly the same way

They went together down the corridor as if they had passed down it
together a dozen times before On the stairway Strangeways looked at the
tapestries with the interest of a familiarized intelligence

It is a beautiful old place he said as they crossed the hall That
armor was worn by a crusader He hesitated a moment when they entered
the library but it was only for a moment He went to the hearth and
took the chair his host offered him and lighting a cigar sat
smoking it If T Tembarom had chanced to be a man of an analytical or
metaphysical order of intellect he would have found during the past
month many things to lead him far in mental argument concerning the
weird wonder of the human mindof its power where its possessor the
body is concerned its sometime closeness to the surface of sentient
being its sometime remoteness He would have knownawed marveling at
the blackness of the pit into which it can descendthe unknown shades
that may enfold it and imprison its gropings The old Duke of Stone had
sat and pondered many an hour over stories his favorite companion had
related to him What curious and subtle processes had the queer fellow
not been watching in the closely guarded quiet of the room where the
stranger had spent his days the strange thing cowering in its darkness
the ray of light piercing the cloud one day and seeming lost again the
next the struggles the imprisoned thing made to come forthto cry out
that it was but immured not wholly conquered and that some hour would
arrive when it would fight its way through at last Tembarom had not
entered into psychological research He had been entirely uncomplex in
his attitude sitting down before his problem as a besieger might have
sat down before a castle The duke had sometimes wondered whether it
was not a good enough thing that he had been so simple about it merely
continuing to believe the best with an unswerving obstinacy and lending
a hand when he could A never flagging sympathy had kept him singularly
alive to every chance and now and then he had illuminations which would
have done credit to a cleverer man and which the duke had rubbed his
hands over in halfamused halftouched elation How he had kept his
head level and held to his purpose

T Tembarom talked but little as he sat in his big chair and smoked
Best let him alone and give him time to get used to the newness he
thought Nothing must happen that could give him a jolt Let things sort
of sink into him and perhaps theyd set him to thinking and lead him
somewhere Strangeways himself evidently did not want talk He never
wanted it unless he was excited He was not excited now and had
settled down as if he was comfortable Having finished one cigar he took
another and began to smoke it much more slowly than he had smoked his
first The slowness began to arrest Tembaroms attention This was the
smoking of a man who was either growing sleepy or sinking into deep
thought becoming oblivious to what he was doing Sometimes he held the
cigar absently between his strong fine fingers seeming to forget it
Tembarom watched him do this until he saw it go out and its white
ash drop on the rug at his feet He did not notice it but sat sinking
deeper and deeper into his own being growing more remote What was
going on under his absorbed stillness Tembarom would not have moved or
spoken for a block of Fifth Avenue he said internally The dark eyes
seemed to become darker until there was only a pins point of light to
be seen in their pupils It was as if he were looking at something at
a distanceat a strangely long distance Twice he turned his head
and appeared to look slowly round the room but not as normal people
lookas if it also was at the strange long distance from him and
he were somewhere outside its walls It was an uncanny thing to be a
spectator to

How dead still the room is Tembarom found himself thinking

It was dead still And it was a queer deal sitting not daring to
movejust watching Something was bound to happen sure What was it
going to be

Strangeways cigar dropped from his fingers and appeared to rouse him
He looked puzzled for a moment and then stooped quite naturally to pick
it up

I forgot it altogether Its gone out he remarked

Have another suggested Tembarom moving the box nearer to him

No thank you He rose and crossed the room to the wall of
bookshelves And Tembaroms eye was caught again by the fineness of
movement and line the evening clothes made manifest What a swell he
looked when he moved about like that What a swell by jings

He looked along the line of shelves and presently took a book down
and opened it He turned over its leaves until something arrested his
attention and then he fell to reading He read several minutes while
Tembarom watched him The silence was broken by his laughing a little

Listen to this he said and began to read something in a language
totally unknown to his hearer A man who writes that sort of thing
about a woman is an old bounder whether hes a poet or not Theres a
small biting spitefulness about it thats cattish

Who did it Tembarom inquired softly It might be a good idea to lead
him on

Horace In spite of his genius he sometimes makes you feel he was
rather a blackguard

Horace For the moment T Tembarom forgot himself I always heard he
was a sort of YMCA old guyold Horace Greeley The Tribune was no
yellow journal when he had it

He was sorry he had spoken the next moment Strangeways looked puzzled

The Tribune he hesitated The Roman Tribune

No New York He started itold Horace did But perhaps were not
talking of the same man

Strangeways hesitated again

No I think were not he answered politely

Ive made a break thought Tembarom I ought to have kept my mouth
shut I must try to switch him back

Strangeways was looking down at the back of the book he held in his
hand

This one was the Latin poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus 65 B C You
know him he said

Oh that one exclaimed Tembarom as if with an air of immense relief
What a fool I was to forget Im glad its him Will you go on reading
and let me hear some more Hes a winner from Winnersvillethat Horace
is

Perhaps it was a sort of miracle accomplished by his great desire to
help the right thing to happen to stave off any shadow of the wrong
thing Whatsoever the reason Strangeways waited only a moment before
turning to his book again It seemed to be a link in some chain slowly
forming itself to drag him back from his wanderings And T Tembarom
lightly sweating as a frightened horse will sat smoking another pipe
and listening intently to Satires and Lampoons read aloud in the
Latin of 65 B C

By gee he said faithfully at intervals when he saw on the readers
face that the moment was ripe He knew it allold Horacedidnt he

He had steered his charge back Things were coming along the line to
him Hed learned Latin at one of these big English schools Boys always
learned Latin the duke had told him They just had to Most of them
hated it like thunder and they used to be caned when they didnt recite
it right Perhaps if he went on hed begin to remember the school A
queer part of it was that he did not seem to notice that he was not
reading his own language

He did not in fact seem to remember anything in particular but went
on quite naturally for some minutes He had replaced Horace on the shelf
and was on the point of taking down another volume when he paused as if
recalling something else

Werent we going to see the picturegallery he inquired Isnt it
getting late I should like to see the portraits

No hurry answered T Tembarom I was just waiting till you were
ready But well go right away if you like

They went without further ceremony As they walked through the hall and
down the corridors side by side an imaginative person might have felt
that perhaps the eyes of an ancient darkling portrait or so looked
down at the pair curiously the long loosely built New Yorker rather
slouching along by the soldierly almost romantic figure which in a
measure suggested that others not unlike it might have trod the same
oaken floor wearing ruff and doublet or lace jabot and sword There
was a far cry between the two but they walked closely in friendly
union When they entered the picturegallery Strangeways paused a moment
again and stood peering down its length

It is very dimly lighted How can we see he said

I told Pearson to leave it dim Tembarom answered I wanted it just
that way at first

He triedand succeeded tolerably wellto say it casually as he led
the way ahead of them He and the duke had not talked the scheme over
for nothing As his grace had said they had worked the thing up As
they moved down the gallery the men and women in their frames looked
like ghosts staring out to see what was about to happen

Well turn up the lights after a while T Tembarom explained still
casually Theres a picture here I think a good deal of Ive stood and
looked at it pretty often It reminded me of some one the first day I
set eyes on it but it was quite a time before I made up my mind who it
was It used to drive me half dotty trying to think it out

Which one was it asked Strangeways

Were coming to it I want to see if it reminds you of any one And I
want you to see it sudden Its got to be sudden he had said to
the duke If its going to pan out I believe its got to be sudden
Thats why I had the rest of em left dim I told Pearson to leave a
lamp I could turn up quick he said to Strangeways

The lamp was on a table near by and was shaded by a screen He took it
from the shadow and lifted it suddenly so that its full gleam fell upon
the portrait of the handsome youth with the lace collar and the dark
drooping eyes It was done in a second with a dramatically unexpected
swiftness His heart jumped up and down

Whos that he demanded with abruptness so sharppitched that the
gallery echoed with the sound Whos that

He heard a hard quick gasp a sound which was momentarily a little
horrible as if the mans soul was being jerked out of his bodys
depths

Who is he he cried again Tell me

After the gasp Strangeways stood still and stared His eyes were glued
to the canvas drops of sweat came out on his forehead and he was
shuddering He began to back away with a look of gruesome struggle He
backed and backed and stared and stared The gasp came twice again
and then his voice seemed to tear itself loose from some power that was
holding it back

That he cried It isitis Miles Hugo

The last words were almost a shout and he shook as if he would have
fallen But T Tembarom put his hand on his shoulder and held him
breathing fast himself Gee if it wasnt like a thing in a play

Page at the court of Charles the Second he rattled off Died of
smallpox when he was nineteen Miles Hugo Miles Hugo You hold on to
that for all your worth And hold on to me Ill keep you steady Say it
again

Miles Hugo The poor majesticlooking fellow almost sobbed it Where
am I What is the name of this place

Its Temple Barholm in the county of Lancashire England Hold on to
that toolike thunder

Strangeways held the young mans arm with hands that clutched He
dragged at him His nightmare held him yet Tembarom saw it but flashes
of light were blinding him

Whohe pleaded in a shaking and hollow whisperare you

Here was a stumper By jings By jings And not a minute to think it
out But the answer came all rightall right

My names Tembarom T Tembarom And he grinned his splendid grin from
sheer sense of relief Im a New YorkerBrooklyn I was just forked
in here anyhow Dont you waste time thinking over me You sit down here
and do your durndest with Miles Hugo




CHAPTER XXXIII


Tembarom did not look as though he had slept particularly well Miss
Alicia thought when they met the next morning but when she asked him
whether he had been disappointed in his last nights experiment he
answered that he had not The experiment had come out all right but
Strangeways had been a good deal worked up and had not been able
to sleep until daylight Sir Ormsby Galloway was to arrive in the
afternoon and hed probably give him something quieting Had the
coming downstairs seemed to help him to recall anything Miss Alicia
naturally inquired Tembarom thought it had He drove to Stone Hover and
spent the morning with the duke he even lunched with him He returned
in time to receive Sir Ormsby Galloway however and until that great
personage left they were together in Mr Strangeways rooms

I guess I shall get him up to London to the place where Sir Ormsby
wants him he said rather nervously after dinner Im not going to
miss any chances If hell go I can get him away quietly some time when
I can fix it so theres no one about to worry him

She felt that he had no inclination to go much into detail He had never
had the habit of entering into the details connected with his strange
charge She believed it was because he felt the subject too abnormal not
to seem a little awesome to her sympathetic timidity She did not ask
questions because she was afraid she could not ask them intelligently
In fact the knowledge that this unknown man was living through his
struggle with his lost past in the remote rooms of the west wing almost
as though he were a secret prisoner did seem a little awesome when one
awoke in the middle of the dark night and thought of it

During the passage of the next few weeks Tembarom went up to London
several times Once he seemed called there suddenly as it was only
during dinner that he told her he was going to take a late train and
should leave the house after she had gone to bed She felt as though
something important must have happened and hoped it was nothing
disturbing

When he had said that Captain Palliser would return to visit them her
private impression despite his laugh had been that it must surely be
some time before this would occur But a little more than three weeks
later he appeared preceded only half an hour by a telegram asking
whether he might not spend a night with them on his way farther north
He could not at all understand why the telegram which he said he had
sent the day before had been delayed

A certain fatigued haggardness in his countenance caused Miss Alicia to
ask whether he had been ill and he admitted that he had at least
not been well as a result of long and too hurried journeys and the
strenuousness of extended and profoundly serious interviews with his
capitalist and magnates

No man can engineer gigantic schemes to success without feeling the
reaction when his load drops from his shoulders he remarked

Youve carried it quite through inquired Tembarom

We have set on foot one of the largest most substantially capitalized
companies in the European business world Palliser replied with the
composure which is almost indifference

Good said Tembarom cheerfully

He watched his guest a good deal during the day He was a bad color for
a man who had just steered clear of all shoals and reached the highest
point of success He had a haggard eye as well as a haggard face It
was a terrified eye when its desperate determination to hide its
terrors dropped from it for an instant as a veil might drop A certain
restlessness was manifest in him and he talked more than usual He
was going to make a visit in Northumberland to an elderly lady of
great possessions It was to be vaguely gathered that she was somewhat
interested in the great companythe Cedric She was a remarkable old
person who found a certain agreeable excitement in dabbling in stocks
She was rich enough to be in a position to regard it as a sort of game
and he had been able on several occasions to afford her entertainment
He would remain a few days and spend his time chiefly in telling her
the details of the great scheme and the manner in which they were to be
developed

If she can play with things that way shell be sure to want stock in
it Tembarom remarked

If she does she must make up her mind quickly Palliser smiled or
she will not be able to get it It is not easy to lay ones hands on
even now

Tembarom thought of certain speculators of entirely insignificant
standing of whom he had chanced to see and hear anecdotes in New York
Most of them were youths of obscure origin who sold newspapers or
blacked boots or swapped articles the value of which lay in the
desire they could excite in other persons to possess them A popular
method known as bluff was their most trusted weapon and even at
twelve and fifteen years of age Tembarom had always regarded it as
singularly obvious He always detested bluff whatsoever its disguise
and was rather mystified by its ingenious faith in itself

Hes got badly stung was his internal comment as he sucked at
his pipe and smiled urbanely at Palliser across the room as they sat
together Hes come here with some sort of deal on that he knows he
couldnt work with any one but just such a fool as he thinks I am I
guess he added in composed reflectiveness I dont really know how
big a fool I do look

Whatsoever the deal was he would be likely to let it be known in time

Hell get it off his chest if hes going away tomorrow decided
Tembarom If theres anything hes found out hell use it If it
doesnt pan out as he thinks it will hell just float away to his old
lady

He gave Palliser every chance talking to him and encouraging him to
talk even asking him to let him look over the prospectus of the new
company and explain details to him as he was going to explain them to
the old lady in Northumberland He opened up avenues but for a time
Palliser made no attempt to stroll down them His walk would be a
stroll Tembarom knew being familiar with his methods His aspect would
be that of a man but little concerned He would be capable of a slightly
rude coldness if he felt that concern on his part was in any degree
counted as a factor Tembarom was aware among other things that
innocent persons would feel that it was incumbent upon them to be very
careful in their treatment of him He seemed to be thinking things over
before he decided upon the psychological moment at which he would begin
if he began When a man had a good deal to lose or to win Tembarom
realized that he would be likely to hold back until he felt something
like solid ground under him

After Miss Alicia had left them for the night perhaps he felt as a
result of thinking the matter over that he had reached a foothold of a
firmness at least somewhat to be depended upon

What a change you have made in that poor womans life he said
walking to the sidetable and helping himself to a brandy and soda
What a change

It struck me that a change was needed just about the time I dropped
in answered his host

All the same suggested Palliser tolerantly you were immensely
generous She wasnt entitled to expect it you know

She didnt expect anything not a darned thing said Tembarom That
was what hit me

Palliser smiled a cold amiable smile His slim neatly fitted person
looked a little shrunken and less straight than was its habit and its
slackness suggested itself as being part of the harry and fatigue which
made his face and eyes haggard under his pale smooth hair

Do you purpose to provide for the future of all your indigent relatives
even to the third and fourth generation my dear chap he inquired

I wont refuse till Im asked anyhow was the answer

Asked Palliser repeated Im one of them you know and Lady Mallowe
is another There are lots of us when we come out of our holes If its
only a matter of asking we might all descend on you

Tembarom smiling wondered whether they hadnt descended already and
whether the descent had so far been all that they had anticipated

Palliser strolled down his opened avenue with an incidental air
which was entirely creditable to his training of himself T Tembarom
acknowledged that much

You are too generous said Palliser You are the sort of fellow
who will always need all he has and more The way you go among the
villagers You think you merely slouch about and keep it quiet but you
dont Youve set an example no other landowner can expect to live up
to or intends to Its too lavish Its pernicious dear chap I have
heard all about the cottage you are doing over for Pearson and his
bride You had better invest in the Cedric

Tembarom wanted him to go on if there was anything in it He made his
face look as he knew Palliser hoped it would look when the psychological
moment came Its expression was not a deterrent in fact it had a
character not unlikely to lead an eager man or one who was not as
wholly experienced as he believed he was to rush down a steep hill into
the sea after the manner of the swine in the parable

Heaven knew Palliser did not mean to rush and was not aware when the
rush began but he had reason to be so much more eager than he professed
to be that momentarily he swerved despite himself and ceased to be
casual

It is an enormous opportunity he saidtimber lands in Mexico you
know If you had spent your life in England you would realize that
timber has become a desperate necessity and that the difficulties which
exist in the way of supplying the demand are almost insuperable These
forests are virtually boundless and the company which controls them

Thats a good spiel broke in Tembarom

It sounded like the crudely artless interruption of a person whose
perceptions left much to be desired T Tembarom knew what it sounded
like If Palliser lost his temper he would get over the ground faster
and he wanted him to get over the ground

Im afraid I dont understand he replied rather stiffly

There was a fellow I knew in New York who used to sell typewriters
and he had a thing to say he used to reel off when any one looked like a
customer He used to call it his spiel

Pallisers quick glance at him asked questions and his stiffness did
not relax itself

Is this New York chaff he inquired coldly

No Tembarom said Youre not doing it for ten per He was

No not exactly said Palliser Neither would you be doing it for ten
per if you went into it His voice changed He became slightly haughty
Perhaps it was a mistake on my part to think you might care to connect
yourself with it You have not of course been in the position to
comprehend such matters

If I was what I look like thatd stir me up and make me feel bad
thought T Tembarom with cheerful comprehension of this at least Id
have to rush in and try to prove to him that I was as accustomed to big
business as he is and that it didnt rattle me The way to do it that
would come most natural would be to show I was ready to buy as big a
block of stock as any other fellow

But the expression of his face did not change He only gave a
halfawkward sort of laugh

I guess I can learn he said

Palliser felt the foothold become firmer The bounder was interested
but after a bounders fashion was either nervous or imagined that
a show of hesitation looked shrewd The slight hit made at his
inexperience in investment had irritated him and made him feel less
cocksure of himself A slightly offended manner might be the best
weapon to rely upon

I thought you might care to have the thing made clear to you he
continued indifferently I meant to explain You may take the chance or
leave it as you like of course That is nothing to me at this stage of
the game But after all we are as I said relatives of a sort and it
is a gigantic opportunity Suppose we change the subject Is that the
Sunday Earth I see by you on the table He leaned forward to take the
paper as though the subject really were dropped but after a seemingly
nervous suck or two at his pipe Tembarom came to his assistance It
wouldnt do to let him quiet down too much

Im no Van Morganbilt he said hesitatingly but I can see that
its a big opportunityfor some one else Lets have a look over the
prospectus again

Palliser paused in his unconcerned opening of the copy of the Sunday
Earth His manner somewhat disgustedly implied indecision as to whether
it was worth while to allow oneself to be dropped and taken up by turns

Do you really mean that he asked with a certain chill of voice

Yes I dont mind trying to catch on to whats doing in any big
scheme

Palliser did not lay aside his suggestion of cold semireluctance more
readily than any man who knew his business would have laid it aside His
manner at the outset was quite perfect His sole ineptitude lay in his
feeling a too great confidence in the exact quality of his companions
type as he summed it up He did not calculate on the variations from
all type sometimes provided by circumstances

He produced his papers without too obvious eagerness He spread them
upon the table and coolly examined them himself before beginning his
explanation There was more to explain to a foreigner and one unused
to investment than there would be to a man who was an Englishman and
familiar with the methods of large companies he said He went into
technicalities so to speak and used rapidly and lightly some imposing
words and phrases to which T Tembarom listened attentively but
without any special air of illumination He dealt with statistics and
the resulting probabilities He made apparent the existing condition
of Englands inability to supply an enormous and unceasing demand for
timber He had acquired divers excellent methods of stating his case to
the party of the second part

He made me feel as if a fellow had better hold on to a box of matches
like grim death and that the time wasnt out of sight when youd
have to give fiftyseven dollars and a half for a toothpick Tembarom
afterwards said to the duke

What Tembarom was thinking as he listened to him was that he was
not getting over the ground with much rapidity and that it was time
something was doing He had not watched him for weeks without learning
divers of his idiosyncrasies

If he thought I wanted to know what he thinks Id a heap rather NOT
know hed never tell me he speculated If he gets a bit hot in the
collar he may let it out Thing is to stir him up Hes lost his nerve
a bit and hell get mad pretty easy

He went on smoking and listening and asking an unenlightened question
now and then in a manner which was as far from being a deterrent as the
largely unilluminated expression of his face was

Of course money is wanted Palliser said at length Money is always
wanted and as much when a scheme is a success as when it isnt
Good names with a certain character are wanted The fact of your
inheritance is known everywhere and the fact that you are an American
is a sort of guaranty of shrewdness

Is it said T Tembarom Well he added slowly I guess Americans
are pretty good business men

Palliser thought that this was evolving upon perfectly natural lines as
he had anticipated it would The fellow was flattered and pleased You
could always reach an American by implying that he was one of those who
specially illustrate enviable national characteristics

He went on in smooth casual laudation

No American takes hold of a scheme of this sort until he knows jolly
well what hes going to get out of it You were shrewd enough he added
significantly about Hutchinsons affair You got in on the ground
floor there That was New York forethought by Jove

Tembarom shuffled a little in his chair and grinned a faint pleased
grin

Im a man of the world my boythe business world Palliser
commented hoping that he concealed his extreme satisfaction I know
New York though I havent lived there Im only hoping to Your air of
ingenuous ignorance is the cleverest thing about you which agreeable
implication of the fact that he had been privately observant and
impressed ought to have fetched the bounder if anything would

T Tembaroms grin was no longer faint but spread itself Pallisers
first impression was that he had fetched him But when he answered
though the very crudeness of his words seemed merely the result of
his betrayal into utter tactlessness by soothed vanity there was
somethinga shade of somethingnot entirely satisfactory in his face
and nasal twang

Well I guess he said New York DID teach a fellow not to buy a gold
brick off every con man that came along

Palliser was guilty of a mere ghost of a start Was there something
in it or was he only the gross blundering fool he had trusted to his
being He stared at him a moment and saw that there WAS something under
the words and behind his professedly flattered grinsomething which
must be treated with a high hand

What do you mean he exclaimed haughtily I dont like your tone Do
you take ME for what you call a con man

Good Lord no answered Tembarom and he looked straight at Palliser
and spoke slowly Youre a gentleman and youre paying me a visit You
could no more try on a game to do me in my own house thanwell than
I could TELL you if Id got on to you if I saw you doing it Youre a
gentleman

Palliser glared back into his infuriatingly candid eyes He was a far
cry from being a dullard himself he was sharp enough to catch on to
the revelation that the situation was not what he had thought it the
type was more complex than he had dreamed The chap had been playing a
part he had absolutely been jollying him along after the New York
fashion He became pale with humiliated rage though he knew his only
defense was to control himself and profess not to see through the trick
Until he could use his big lever he added to himself

Oh I see he commented acridly I suppose you dont realize that
your figures of speech are unfortunate

That comes of New York streets too Tembarom answered with
deliberation But you cant live as Ive lived and be dead easynot
DEAD easy

Palliser had left his chair and stood in contemptuous silence

You know how a fellow hates to be thought DEAD easyTembarom actually
went to the insolent length of saying the words with a touch of cheerful
confidingnesswhen hes NOT And Im not Have another drink

There was a pause Palliser began to see or thought he began to see
where he stood He had come to Temple Barholm because he had been driven
into a corner and had a dangerous fight before him In anticipation of
it he had been following a clue for some time though at the outset it
had been one of incredible slightness Only his absolute faith in his
theory that every man had something to gain or lose which he concealed
discreetly had led him to it He held a card too valuable to be used
at the beginning of a game Its power might have lasted a long time and
proved an influence without limit He forbore any mental reference to
blackmail the word was absurd One used what fell into ones hands
If Tembarom had followed his lead with any degree of docility he would
have felt it wiser to save his ammunition until further pressure was
necessary But behind his ridiculous rawness his foolish jocularity
and his professedly candid good humor had been hidden the Yankee
trickster who was fool enough to think he could play his game through
Well he could not

During the few moments pause he saw the situation as by a photographic
flashlight He leaned over the table and supplied himself with a fresh
brandy and soda from the tray of siphons and decanters He gave himself
time to take the glass up in his hand

No he answered you are not dead easy Thats why I am going to
broach another subject to you

Tembarom was refilling his pipe

Go ahead he said

Who by the way is Mr Strangeways

He was deliberate and entirely unemotional So was T Tembarom when
with match applied to his tobacco he replied between puffs as he
lighted it

You can search me You can search him too for that matter He doesnt
know who he is himself

Bad luck for him remarked Palliser and allowed a slight pause again
After it he added Did it ever strike you it might be good luck for
somebody else

Somebody else Tembarom puffed more slowly perhaps because his pipe
was lighted

Palliser took some brandy in his soda

There are men you know he suggested who can be spared by their
relatives I have some myself by Jove he added with a laugh You
keep him rather dark dont you

He doesnt like to see people

Does he object to people seeing him I saw him once myself

When you threw the gravel at his window

Palliser stared contemptuously

What are you talking about I did not throw stones at his window he
lied Im not a schoolboy

Thats so Tembarom admitted

I saw him nevertheless And I can tell you he gave me rather a start

Why

Palliser half laughed again He did not mean to go too quickly he would
let the thing get on Tembaroms nerves gradually

Well Im hanged if I didnt take him for a man who is dead

Enough to give any fellow a jolt Tembarom admitted again

It gave me a jolt Good word that But it would give you a bigger
one my dear fellow if he was the man he looked like

Why Tembarom asked laconically

He looked like Jem Temple Barholm

He saw Tembarom start There could be no denying it

You thought that Honest he said sharply as if for a moment he had
lost his head You thought that

Dont be nervous Perhaps I couldnt have sworn to it I did not see
him very close

T Tembarom puffed rapidly at his pipe and only ejaculated

Oh

Of course hes dead If he wasntwith a shrug of his
shouldersLady Joan Fayre would be Lady Joan Temple Barholm and the
pair would be bringing up an interesting family here He looked about
the room and then as if suddenly recalling the fact added By
George youd be selling newspapers or making themwhich was itin
New York

It was by no means unpleasing to see that he had made his hit there
T Tembarom swung about and walked across the room with a suddenly
perturbed expression

Say he put it to him coming back are you in earnest or are you
just saying it to give me a jolt

Palliser studied him The American sharpness was not always so keen as
it sometimes seemed His face would have betrayed his uneasiness to the
dullest onlooker

Have you any objection to my seeing him in his own room Palliser
inquired

It does him harm to see people Tembarom said with nervous
brusqueness It worries him

Palliser smiled a quiet but far from agreeable smile He enjoyed what he
put into it

Quite so best to keep him quiet he returned Do you know what my
advice would be Put him in a comfortable sanatorium A lot of stupid
investigations would end in nothing of course but theyd be a
frightful bore

He thought it extraordinarily stupid in T Tembarom to come nearer to
him with an anxious eagerness entirely unconcealed if he really knew
what he was doing

Are you sure that if you saw him close youd KNOW so that you could
swear to him he demanded

Youre extremely nervous arent you Palliser watched him with
smiling coolness Of course Jem Temple Barholm is dead but Ive no
doubt that if I saw this man of yours I could swear he had remained
deadif I were asked

If you knew him well you could make me sure You could swear one way
or another I want to be SURE said Tembarom

So should I in your place couldnt be too sure Well since you
ask me I COULD swear I knew him well enough He was one of my most
intimate enemies What do you say to letting me see him

I would if I could Tembarom replied as if thinking it over I would
if I could

Palliser treated him to the far from pleasing smile again

But its quite impossible at present he suggested Excitement is
not good for him and all that sort of thing You want time to think it
over

Tembaroms slowly uttered answer spoken as if he were still considering
the matter was far from being the one he had expected

I want time but thats not the reason you cant see him right now You
cant see him because hes not here Hes gone

Then it was Palliser who started taken totally unaware in a manner
which disgusted him altogether He had to pull himself up

Hes gone he repeated You are quicker than I thought Youve got
him safely away have you Well I told you a comfortable sanatorium
would be a good idea

Yes you did T Tembarom hesitated seeming to be thinking it over
again Thats so He laid his pipe aside because it had gone out

He suddenly sat down at the table putting his elbows on it and his face
in his hands with a harried effect of wanting to think it over in
a sort of withdrawal from his immediate surroundings This was as it
should be His Yankee readiness had deserted him altogether

By Jove you are nervous Palliser commented Its not surprising
though I can sympathize with you With a markedly casual air he
himself sat down and drew his documents toward him Let us talk of
something else he said He preferred to be casual and incidental if
he were allowed It was always better to suggest things and let them
sink in until people saw the advantage of considering them and you To
manage a business matter without open argument or too frank a display of
weapons was at once more comfortable and in better taste

You are making a great mistake in not going into this he suggested
amiably You could go in now as you went into Hutchinsons affair on
the ground floor Thats a good enough phrase too Twenty thousand
pounds would make you a million You Americans understand nothing less
than millions

But T Tembarom did not take him up He muttered in a worried way from
behind his shading hands Well talk about that later

Why not talk about it now before anything can interfere Palliser
persisted politely almost gently

Tembarom sprang up restless and excited He had plainly been planning
fast in his temporary seclusion

Im thinking of what you said about Lady Joan he burst forth Say
shes gone through all this Jem Temple Barholm thing once it about half
killed her If any one raised false hopes for her shed go through it
all again Once is enough for any woman

His effect at professing heat and strong feeling made a spark of
amusement show itself in Pallisers eye It struck him as being
peculiarly American in its affectation of sentiment and chivalry

I see he said Its Lady Joan youre disturbed about You want to
spare her another shock I see You are a considerate fellow as well as
a man of business

I dont want her to begin to hope if

Very good taste on your part Pallisers polite approval was
admirable but he tapped lightly on the paper after expressing it I
dont want to seem to press you about this but dont you feel inclined
to consider it I can assure you that an investment of this sort would
be a good thing to depend on if the unexpected happened If you gave
me your check now it would be Cedric stock tomorrow and quite safe
Suppose you

II dont believe you were rightabout what you thought The
sharpfeatured face was changing from pale to red Youd have to be
able to swear to it anyhow and I dont believe you can He looked at
Palliser in eager and anxious uncertainty If you could he dragged
out I shouldnt have a checkbook Where would you be then

I should be in comfortable circumstances dear chap and so would you
if you gave me the money tonight while you possess a checkbook It
would be only a sort of temporary loan in any case whatever turned up
The investment would quadruple itself But there is no time to be lost
Understand that

T Tembarom broke out into a sort of boyish resentment

I dont believe he did look like him anyhow he cried I believe
its all a bluff His crudesounding young swagger had a touch of final
desperation in it as he turned on Palliser Im dead sure its a bluff
What a fool I was not to think of that You want to bluff me into
going into this Cedric thing You could no more swear he was like him
thanthan I could

The outright presumptuous bold stripping bare of his phrases
infuriated Palliser too suddenly and too much He stepped up to him and
looked into his eyes

Bluff you you young bounder he flung out at him Youre losing
your head Youre not in New York streets here You are talking to a
gentleman No he said furiously I couldnt swear that he was like
him but what I can swear in any court of justice is that the man I saw
at the window was Jem Temple Barholm and no other man on earth

When he had said it he saw the astonishing dolt change his expression
utterly again as if in a flash He stood up putting his hands in his
pockets His face changed his voice changed

Fine he said Firstrate Thats what I wanted to get on to




CHAPTER XXXIV


After this climax the interview was not so long as it was interesting
Two men as far apart as the poles as remote from each other in mind
and body in training and education or lack of it in desires and
intentions in points of view and trend of being as nature and
circumstances could make them talked in a language foreign to each
other of a wildly strange thing Pallisers arguments and points of
aspect were less unknown to T Tembarom than his own were to Palliser
He had seen something very like them before though they had developed
in different surroundings and had been differently expressed The
colloquialism Youre not doing that for your health can be made
to cover much ground in the way of the stripping bare of motives for
action This was what in excellent and wellchosen English Captain
Palliser frankly said to his host Of nothing which T Tembarom said
to him in his own statement did he believe one word or syllable The
statement in question was not long or detailed It was of course
Palliser saw a ridiculously impudent flinging together of a farrago
of nonsense transparent in its effort beyond belief Before he had
listened five minutes with the distinctly nasty smile he burst out
laughing

That is a good spiel my dear chap he said Its as good a spiel
as your typewriter friend used to rattle off when he thought he saw a
customer but Im not a customer

Tembarom looked at him interestedly for about ten seconds His hands
were thrust into his trousers pockets as was his almost invariable
custom Absorption and speculation even emotion and excitement were
usually expressed in this unconventional manner



You dont believe a darned word of it was his sole observation

Not a darned word Palliser smiled You are trying a bluff which
doesnt do credit to your usual sharpness Its a bluff that is actually
silly It makes you look like an ass

Well its true said Tembarom its true

Palliser laughed again

I only said it made you look like an ass he remarked I dont
profess to understand you altogether because you are a new species
Your combination of ignorance and sharpness isnt easy to calculate on
But there is one thing I have found out and that is that when you want
to play a particular sharp trick you are willing to let people take
you for a fool Ill own youve deceived me once or twice even when I
suspected you Ive heard thats one of the most successful methods used
in the American business world Thats why I only say you look like an
ass You are an ass in some respects but you are letting yourself look
like one now for some shrewd end You either think youll slip out of
danger by it when I make this discovery public or you think youll
somehow trick me into keeping my mouth shut

I neednt trick you into keeping your mouth shut Tembarom suggested
Theres a straightway to do that aint there And he indelicately
waved his hand toward the documents pertaining to the Cedric Company

It was stupid as well as gross in his hearers opinion If he had known
what was good for him he would have been clever enough to ignore the
practical presentation of his case made half an hour or so earlier

No there is not Palliser replied with serene mendacity No
suggestion of that sort has been made My business proposition was given
out on an entirely different basis You of course choose to put your
personal construction upon it

Gee whiz ejaculated T Tembarom I was way off wasnt I

I told you that professing to be an ass wouldnt be good enough in this
case Dont go on with it said Palliser sharply

Youre throwing bouquets Let a fellow be natural said Tembarom

That is bluff too Palliser replied more sharply still I am not
taken in by it bold as it is Ever since you came here you have been
playing this game It was your fools grin and guffaw and pretense of
good nature that first made me suspect you of having something up your
sleeve You were too unembarrassed and candid

So you began to look out Tembarom said considering him curiously
just because of that Then suddenly he laughed outright the fools
guffaw

It somehow gave Palliser a sort of puzzled shock It was so hearty that
it remotely suggested that he appeared more secure than seemed possible
He tried to reply to him with a languid contempt of manner

You think you have some tremendously sharp deal in your hand he
said but you had better remember you are in England where facts are
like sledgehammers You cant dodge from under them as you can in
America I dare say you wont answer me but I should like to ask you
what you propose to do

I dont know what Im going to do any more than you do was the
unilluminating answer I dont mind telling you that

And what do you think he will do

Ive got to wait till I find out Im doing it That was what I told
you What are you going to do he added casually

Im going to Lincolns Inn Fields to have an interview with Palford 
Grimby

Thats a good enough move commented Tembarom if you think you can
prove what you say Youve got to prove things you know I couldnt so
I lay low and waited just like I told you

Of course of course Palliser himself almost grinned in his derision
You have only been waiting

When youve got to prove a thing and havent much to go on youve got
to wait said T Tembaromto wait and keep your mouth shut whatever
happens and to let yourself be taken for a fool or a horsethief isnt
as giltedged a job as it seems But proofs what its best to have
before you ring up the curtain Youd have to have it yourself So
would Palford  Grimby before itd be stonecold safe to rush things and
accuse a man of a penitentiary offense

He took his unconventional halfseat on the edge of the table with one
foot on the floor and the other one lightly swinging

Palford  Grimby are clever old ducks and they know that much Thing
theyd know best would be that to set a raft of lies going about a
man whos got money enough to defend himself and to make them pay big
damages for it afterward would be pretty bum business I guess they
know all about what proof stands for They may have to wait so may you
same as I have

Palliser realized that he was in the position of a man striking at an
adversary whose construction was of Indiarubber He struck home but
left no bruise and drew no blood which was an irritating thing He lost
his temper

Proof he jerked out There will be proof enough and when it is made
public you will not control the money you threaten to use

When you get proof just you let me hear about it T Tembarom said
And all the money Im threatening on shall go where it belongs and
Ill go back to New York and sell papers if I have to It wont come as
hard as you think

The flippant insolence with which he brazened out his pretense that he
had not lied that his ridiculous romance was actual and simple truth
suggested dangerous readiness of device and secret knowledge of power
which could be adroitly used

You are merely marking time said Palliser rising with cold
determination to be juggled with no longer You have hidden him away
where you think you can do as you please with a man who is an invalid
That is your dodge Youve got him hidden somewhere and his friends had
better get at him before it is too late

Im not answering questions this evening and Im not giving addresses
though there are no witnesses to take them down If hes hidden away
hes where he wont be disturbed was T Tembaroms rejoinder You may
lay your bottom dollar on that

Palliser walked toward the door without speaking He had almost reached
it when he whirled about involuntarily arrested by a shout of laughter

Say announced Tembarom you maynt know it but this layout would
make a firstrate turn in a vaudeville You think Im lying I look like
Im lying I guess every word I say sounds like Im lying To a fellow
like you I guess it couldnt help but sound that way And Im not
lying Thats where the joke comes in Im not lying Ive not told you
all I know because its none of your business and wouldnt help but
what I have told you is the stonecold truth

He was keeping it up to the very end with a desperate determination
not to let go his hold of his pose until he had made his private shrewd
deal whatsoever it was At least so it struck Palliser who merely
said

I m leaving the house by the first train tomorrow morning He fixed
a cold gray eye on the fools grin

Six fortyfive said T Tembarom Ill order the carriage I might go
up myself

The door closed


Tembarom was looking cheerful enough when he went into his bedroom He
had become used to its size and had learned to feel that it was a good
sort of place It had the hall bedroom at Mrs Bowses boardinghouse
beaten to a frazzle There was about everything in it that any man
could hatch up an idea hed like to have He had slept luxuriously
on the splendid carved bed through long nights he had lain awake
and thought out things on it he had lain and watched the firelight
flickering on the ceiling as he thought about Ann and made plans and
fixed up the Harlem flat which could be run on fifteen per He had
picked out the pieces of furniture from the Sunday Earth advertisement
sheet and had set them in their places He always saw the sixdollar
mahoganystained table set for supper with Ann at one end and himself
at the other He had grown actually fond of the old room because of the
silence and comfort of it which tended to give reality to his dreams
Pearson who had ceased to look anxious and who had acquired fresh
accomplishments in the form of an entirely new set of duties was
waiting and handed him a telegram

This just arrived sir he explained James brought it here because
he thought you had come up and I didnt send it down because I heard
you on the stairs

Thats right Thank you Pearson his master said

He tore the yellow envelop and read the message In a moment Pearson
knew it was not an ordinary message and therefore remained more than
ordinarily impassive of expression He did not even ask of himself what
it might convey

Mr Temple Barholm stood still a few seconds with the look of a man who
must think and think rapidly

What is the next train to London Pearson he asked

There is one at twelve thirtysix sir he answered Its the last
till six in the morning You have to change at Crowley

Youre always ready Pearson returned Mr Temple Barholm I want to
get that train

Pearson was always ready Before the last word was quite spoken he had
turned and opened the bedroom door

Ill order the dogcart thats quickest sir he said He was out of
the room and in again almost immediately Then he was at the wardrobe
and taking out what Mr Temple Barholm called his grip but what
Pearson knew as a Gladstone bag It was always kept ready packed for
unexpected emergencies of travel

Mr Temple Barholm sat at the table and drew pen and paper toward him
He looked excited he looked more troubled than Pearson had seen him
look before

The wires from Sir Ormsby Galloway Pearson he said

Its about Mr Strangeways Hes done what I used to be always watching
out against hes disappeared

Disappeared sir cried Pearson and almost dropped the Gladstone bag
I beg pardon sir I know theres no time to lose He steadied the bag
and went on with his task without even turning round

His master was in some difficulty He began to write and after dashing
off a few words stopped and tore them up

No he muttered that wont do Theres no time to explain Then he
began again but tore up his next lines also

That says too much and not enough Itd frighten the life out of her

He wrote again and ended by folding the sheet and putting it into an
envelop

This is a message for Miss Alicia he said to Pearson Give it to
her in the morning I dont want her to worry because I had to go in
a hurry Tell her everythings going to be all right but you neednt
mention that anythings happened to Mr Strangeways

Yes sir answered Pearson

Mr Temple Barholm was already moving about the room doing odd things
for himself rapidly and he went on speaking

I want you and Rose to know he said that whatever happens you are
both fixed all rightboth of you Ive seen to that

Thank you sir Pearson faltered made uneasy by something new in his
tone You said whatever happened sir

Whatever old thing happens his master took him up

Not to you sir Oh I hope sir that nothing

Mr Temple Barholm put a cheerful hand on his shoulder

Nothings going to happen thatll hurt any one Things may change
thats all You and Rose are all right Miss Alicias all right Im all
right Come along Got to catch that train

In this manner he took his departure

Miss Alicia had from necessity acquired the habit of early rising at
Rowcroft vicarage and as the next morning was bright she was clipping
roses on a terrace before breakfast when Pearson brought her the note

Mr Temple Barholm received a telegram from London last night maam
he explained and he was obliged to take the midnight train He hadnt
time to do any more than leave a few lines for you but he asked me to
tell you that nothing disturbing had occurred He specially mentioned
that everything was all right

But how very sudden exclaimed Miss Alicia opening her note and
beginning to read it Plainly it had been written hurriedly indeed It
read as though he had been in such haste that he hadnt had time to be
clear


Dear little Miss Alicia

Ive got to light out of here as quick as I can make it I cant even
stop to tell you why Theres just one thingdont get rattled Miss
Alicia Whatever any one says or does just dont let yourself get
rattled

Yours affectionately

T TEMBAROM


Pearson Miss Alicia exclaimed again looking up are you sure
everything is all right

That was what he said maam All right maam

Thank you Pearson I am glad to hear it

She walked to and fro in the sunshine reading the note and rereading
it

Of course if he said it was all right it was all right she murmured
It is only the phrasing that makes me slightly nervous Why should he
ask me not to get rattled The term was by this time as familiar to her
as any in Dr Johnsons dictionary Of course he knows I do get rattled
much too easily but why should I be in danger of getting rattled now
if nothing has happened She gave a very small start as she remembered
something Could it be that Captain PalliserBut how could he Though
I do not like Captain Palliser

Captain Palliser her distaste for whom at the moment quite agitated
her was this morning an early riser also and as she turned in her walk
she found him coming toward her

I find I am obliged to take an early train to London this morning
he said after their exchange of greetings It is quite unexpected I
spoke to Mr Temple Barholm about it last night

Perhaps the unexpectedness perhaps a certain suggestion of coincidence
caused Miss Alicias side ringlets to appear momentarily tremulous

Then perhaps we had better go in to breakfast at once she said

Is Mr Temple Barholm down he inquired as they seated themselves at
the breakfasttable

He is not here she answered He too was called away unexpectedly
He went to London by the midnight train

She had never been so aware of her unchristian lack of liking for
Captain Palliser as she was when he paused a moment before he made any
comment His pause was as marked as a start and the smile he indulged
in was she felt most singularly disagreeable It was a smile of the
order which conceals an unpleasant explanation of itself

Oh he remarked he has gone first has he

Yes she answered pouring out his coffee for him He evidently had
business of importance

They were quite alone and she was not one of the women one need disturb
oneself about She had been browbeaten into hypersensitive timidity
early in life and did not know how to resent cleverly managed polite
bullying She would always feel herself at fault if she was tempted to
criticize any one She was innocent and nervous enough to betray herself
to any extent because she would feel it rude to refuse to answer
questions howsoever far they exceeded the limits of polite curiosity
He had learned a good deal from her in the past Why not try what could
be startled out of her now Thus Captain Palliser said

I dare say you feel a little anxious at such an extraordinarily sudden
departure he suggested amiably Bolting off in the middle of the
night was sudden if he did not explain himself

He had no time to explain she answered

That makes it appear all the more sudden But no doubt he left you
a message I saw you were reading a note when I joined you on the
terrace

Lightly casual as he chose to make the words sound they were an
audacity he would have known better than to allow himself with any one
but a timid earlyVictorian spinster whose politeness was hypersensitive
in its quality

He particularly desired that I should not be anxious she said He is
always considerate

He would of course have explained everything if he had not been so
hurried

Of course if it had been necessary answered Miss Alicia nervously
sipping her tea

Naturally said Captain Palliser His note no doubt mentioned that he
went away on business connected with his friend Mr Strangeways

There was no question of the fact that she was startled

He had not time enough she said He could only write a few lines
Mr Strangeways

We had a long talk about him last night He told me a remarkable
story Captain Palliser went on I suppose you are quite familiar with
all the details of it

I know how he found him in New York and I know how generous he has
been to him

Have you been told nothing more

There was nothing more to tell If there was anything I am sure he had
some good reason for not telling me said Miss Alicia loyally His
reasons are always good

Pallisers air of losing a shade or so of discretion as a result of
astonishment was really well done

Do you mean to say that he has not even hinted that ever since he
arrived at Temple Barholm he has strongly suspected Strangeways
identitythat he has even known who he is he exclaimed

Miss Alicias small hands clung to the tablecloth

He has not known at all He has been most anxious to discover He has
used every endeavor she brought out with some difficulty

You say he has been trying to find out Palliser interposed

He has been more than anxious she protested He has been to London
again and again he has gone to great expense he has even seen people
from Scotland Yard I have sometimes almost thought he was assuming more
responsibility than was just to himself In the case of a relative or an
old friend but for an entire strangerOh really I ought not to seem
to criticize I do not presume to criticize his wonderful generosity and
determination and goodness No one should presume to question him

If he knows that you feel like this Palliser began

He knows all that I feel Miss Alicia took him up with a pretty
rising spirit He knows that I am full of unspeakable gratitude to him
for his beautiful kindness to me he knows that I admire and respect and
love him in a way I could never express and that I would do anything in
the world he could wish me to do

Naturally said Captain Palliser I was only about to express my
surprise that since he is aware of all this he has not told you who he
has proved Strangeways to be It is a little odd you know

I think Miss Alicia was even gently firm in her replythat you
are a little mistaken in believing Mr Temple Barholm has proved Mr
Strangeways to be anybody When he has proof he will no doubt think
proper to tell me about it Until then I should prefer

Palliser laughed as he finished her sentence

Not to know I was not going to betray him Miss Alicia He evidently
has one of his excellent reasons for keeping things to himself I may
mention however that it is not so much he who has proof as I myself

You How could she help quite starting in her seat when his gray eyes
fixed themselves on her with such a touch of finely amused malice

I offered him the proof last night and it rather upset him he said
He thought no one knew but himself and he was not inclined to tell the
world He was upset because I said I had seen the man and could swear to
his identity That was why he went away so hurriedly He no doubt went
to see Strangeways and talk it over

See Mr Strangeways But Mr Strangeways Miss Alicia rose and rang
the bell

Tell Pearson I wish to see him at once she said to the footman

Palliser took in her mood without comment He had no objection to being
present when she made inquiries of Pearson

I hear the wheels of the dogcart he remarked You see I must catch
my train

Pearson stood at the door

Is not Mr Strangeways in his room Pearson Miss Alicia asked

Mr Temple Barholm took him to London when he last went maam
answered Pearson You remember he went at night The doctor thought it
best

He did not tell you that either said Palliser casually

The dogcart is at the door sir announced Pearson

Miss Alicias hand was unsteady when the departing guest took it

Dont be disturbed he said considerately but a most singular thing
has happened When I asked so many questions about Temple Barholms Man
with the Iron Mask I asked them for curious reasons That must be my
apology You will hear all about it later probably from Palford 
Grimby

When he had left the room Miss Alicia stood upon the hearthrug as the
dogcart drove away and she was pale Her simple and easily disturbed
brain was in a whirl She could scarcely remember what she had heard
and could not in the least comprehend what it had seemed intended to
imply except that there had been concealed in the suggestions some
disparagement of her best beloved

Singular as it was that Pearson should return without being summoned
when she turned and found that he mysteriously stood inside the
threshold again as if she had called him she felt a great sense of
relief

Pearson she faltered I am rather upset by certain things which
Captain Palliser has said I am afraid I do not understand

She looked at him helplessly not knowing what more to say She wished
extremely that she could think of something definite

The masterly finish of Pearsons reply lay in its neatly restrained hint
of unobtrusively perceptive sympathy

Yes Miss I was afraid so Which is why I took the liberty of stepping
into the room again I myself do not understand but of course I do not
expect to If I may be so bold as to say it Miss whatever we dont
understand we both understand Mr Temple Barholm My instructions were
to remind you Miss that everything would be all right

Miss Alicia took up her letter from the table where she had laid it
down

Thank you Pearson she said her forehead beginning to clear itself
a little Of course of course I ought not toHe told me not toget
rattled she added with plaintive ingenuousness and I ought not to
above all things

Yes Miss It is most important that you should not




CHAPTER XXXV


The story of the adventures experiences and journeyings of Mr Joseph
Hutchinson his daughter and the invention if related in detail would
prove reading of interest but as this is merely a study of the manner
in which the untrained characteristics and varied limitations of one man
adjusted or failed to adjust themselves to incongruous surroundings and
totally unpreparedfor circumstances such details whatsoever their
potential picturesqueness can be touched upon but lightly No new idea
of value to the world of practical requirements is presented to the
public at large without the waking of many sleeping dogs and the
stirring of many snapping fish floating with open ears and eyes in
many pools An uneducated blustering obstinate man of one idea having
resentfully borne discouragement and wounded egotism for years and
suddenly confronting immense promise of success is not unlikely to be
prey easily harpooned Joseph Hutchinsons rebound from despair to high
and wellfounded hope made of him exactly what such a man is always
made by such rebound The testimony to his genius and judgment which
acknowledgment of the value of his work implied was naturally in his
opinion only a proper tribute which the public had been a bullheaded
fool not to lay at his feet years before So much time lost and so much
money for it as well as for him and served em all damned well right
he said If Temple Barholm hadnt come into his money and hadnt
had more sense than the rest of them where would they all have been
Perhaps theyd never have had the benefit of the thing hed been telling
them about for years He prided himself immensely on the possession of a
business shrewdness which was an absolute defense against any desire
on the part of the iniquitous to overreach him He believed it to be a
peculiarly Lancashire characteristic and kept it in view constantly

Lancashires not easy to do he would say hilariously Them that can
do a Lancashire chap has got to look out that they get up early in the
morning and dont go to bed till late

Smoothmannered and astute men of business who knew how to make a man
talk were given diffuse and loudvoiced explanations of his methods and
longacknowledged merits and characteristics His life his morals and
his training or rather lack of it were laid before them as examples
of what a man might work himself up to if he had it in him Education
didnt do it He had never been to naught but a village school where
hed picked up precious little but the three Rs It had to be born in a
man Look at him His invention promised to bring him in a fortune like
a dukes if he managed it right and kept his eyes open for sharpers
This company and that company were after him but Lancashire didnt snap
up things without going into em and under em and through em for
the matter of that

The wellmannered gentlemen of business stimulated him greatly by their
appreciative attention He sometimes lost his head a trifle and almost
bullied them but they did not seem to mind it Their apparently
oldtime knowledge of and respect for Lancashire business sagacity
seemed invariably a marked thing Men of genius and powerful character
combined with practical shrewdness of outlook they intimated were of
enormous value to the business world They were to be counted upon as
important factors They could see and deal with both sides of a proposal
as those of weaker mind could not

That they can Hutchinson would admit rolling about in his chair and
thrusting his hands in his pockets Theyve got some bottom to stand
on And he would feel amenable to reason

Little Ann found her duties and responsibilities increasing daily Many
persons seemed to think it necessary to come and talk business and
father had so much to think of and reason out so that he could be
sure that he didnt make any mistakes In a quiet remote and darkened
corner of her mind in which were stored all such things as it was well
to say little or nothing about there was discreetly kept for reference
the secretly acquired knowledge that father did not know so much about
business ways and business people as he thought he did Mother had
learned this somewhat important fact and had secluded it in her own
private mental storeroom with much affectionate delicacy

Fathers a great man and a good man Ann love she had confided to
her choosing an occasion when her husband was a hundred miles away
and he IS rightdown Lancashire in his clever way of seeing through
people that think themselves sharp but when a man is a genius and
nobleminded he sometimes cant see the right peoples faults and
wickedness He thinks they mean as honest as he does And theres times
when he may get taken in if some one perhaps not half as clever as
he is doesnt look after him When the inventions taken up and
everybodys running after him to try to cheat him out of his rights if
Im not there Ann you must just keep with him and watch every minute
Ive seen these sharp tricky ones rightdown flinch and quail when
there was a nice quietbehaved woman in the room and she just fixed
her eye steady and clearlike on them and showed shed took in every
word and was like to remember You know what I mean Ann youve got
that look in your own eye

She had The various persons who interviewed Mr Hutchinson became
familiar with the fact that he had an unusual intimacy with and
affection for his daughter She was present on all occasions If she had
not been such a quiet and entirely unobtrusive little thing she
might have been an obstacle to freedom of expression But she seemed a
childish unsophisticated creature who always had a book with her when
she waited in an office and a trifle of sewing to occupy herself with
when she was at home At first she so obliterated herself that she was
scarcely noticed but in course of time it became observed by some that
she was curiously pretty The face usually bent over her book or work
was tinted like a flower and she had quite magnificent red hair A
stout old financier first remarked her eyes He found one day that she
had quietly laid her book on her lap and that they were resting upon
him like unflinching crystals as he talked to her father Their serenity
made him feel annoyed and uncomfortable It was a sort of recording
serenity He felt as though she would so clearly remember every word he
had said that she would be able to write it down when she went home and
he did not care to have it written down So he began to wander somewhat
in his argument and did not reach his conclusions

I was glad Father to see how you managed that gentleman this
afternoon Little Ann said that night when Hutchinson had settled
himself with his pipe after an excellent dinner

Eh he exclaimed Eh

The one she exclaimed that thought he was so sure he was going to
persuade you to sign that paper I do wonder he could think youd listen
to such a poor offer and tie up so much Why even I could see he
was trying to take advantage and I know nothing in the world about
business

The financier in question had been a brilliant and laudatory
conversationalist and had so soothed and exhilarated Mr Hutchinson
that such perils had beset him as his most lurid imaginings could never
have conceived in his darkest moments of believing that the entire
universe had ceased all other occupation to engage in that of defrauding
him of his rights and dues He had been so uplifted by the admiration of
his genius so properly exhibited and the fluency with which his future
fortunes had been described that he had been huffed when the arguments
seemed to dwindle away Little Ann startled him but it was not he
who would show signs of dismay at the totally unexpected expression of
adverse opinion He had got into the habit of always listening though
inadvertently as it were to Ann as he had inadvertently listened to
her mother

Rosenthal he said Are you talking about him

Yes I am Little Ann answeered smiling approvingly over her bit of
sewing Father I wish youd try and teach me some of the things you
know about business Ive learned a little by just listening to you
talk but I should so like to feel as if I could follow you when you
argue I do so enjoy hearing you argue Its just an education

Women are not up to much at business reflected Hutchinson If youd
been a boy Id have trained you same as Ive trained myself Youre a
sharp little thing Ann but youre a woman Not but what a womans the
best thing on earth he added almost severely in his convictionthe
best thing on earth in her place I dont know what Id ever have done
without you Ann in the bad times

He loved her blundering old egotist just as he had loved her mother
Ann always knew it and her own love for him warmed all the world about
them both She got up and went to him to kiss him and pat him and
stuff a cushion behind his stout back

And now the good times have come she said bestowing on him two or
three special little pats which were caresses of her own invention and
people see what you are and always have been as they ought to have seen
long ago I dont want to feel as if I couldnt keep up with you and
understand your plans Perhaps Ive got a little bit of your cleverness
and you might teach me to use it in small ways Ive got a good memory
you know Father love and I might recollect things people say and make
bits of notes of them to save you trouble And I can calculate I once
got a copy of Bunyans Pilgrims Progress for a prize at the village
school just for sums

The bald but unacknowledged fact that Mr Hutchinson had never exhibited
gifts likely to entitle him to receive a prize for sums caused this
suggestion to be one of some practical value When business men talked
to him of per cents and tenth shares or net receipts and expected him
to comprehend their proportions upon the spot without recourse to
pencil and paper he felt himself grow hot and nervous and red and was
secretly terrified lest the party of the second part should detect that
he was tossed upon seas of horrible uncertainty T Tembarom in the same
situation would probably have said This is the place where T T sits
down a while to take breath and count things up on his fingers I am not
a sharp on arithmetic and I need timelots of it

Mr Hutchinsons way was to bluster irritatedly

Aye aye I see that of course plain enough I see that And feel
himself breaking into a cold perspiration Eh this English climate
is a damp un he would add when it became necessary to mop his red
forehead somewhat with his big clean handkerchief

Therefore he found it easy to receive Little Anns proposition with
favor

Theres summat i that he acknowledged graciously dropping into
Lancashire Thats one of the little things a woman can do if shes
sharp at figures Your mother taught me that much She always said women
ought to look after the bits of things as was too small for a man to
bother with

Men have the big things to look after Thats enough for anybody
said Little Ann And they ought to leave something for women to do
If youll just let me keep notes for you and remember things and answer
your letters and just make calculations youre too busy to attend to I
should feel rightdown happy Father

Eh he said relievedly tha art like thy mother

That would make me happy if there was nothing else to do it said Ann
smoothing his shoulder

Youre her girl he said warmed and supported

Yes Im her girl and Im yours Now isnt there some little thing
I could begin with Would you mind telling me if I was right in what I
thought you thought about Mr Rosenthals offer

What did you think I thought about it He was able to put affectionate
condescension into the question

She went to her workbasket and took out a sheet of paper She came back
and sat cozily on the arm of his chair

I had to put it all down when I came home she said I wanted to make
sure I hadnt forgotten I do hope I didnt make mistakes

She gave it to him to look at and as he settled himself down to its
careful examination she kept her blue eyes upon him She herself did
not know that it was a wonderful little document in its neatly jotted
down notes of the exact detail most important to his interests

There were figures there were calculations of profits there were
records of the gist of his replies there were things Hutchinson
himself could not possibly have fished out of the jumbled ragbag of his
uncertain recollections

Did I say that he exclaimed once

Yes Father love and I could see it upset him I was watching his face
because it wasnt a face I took to

Joseph Hutchinson began to chucklethe chuckle of a relieved and
gratified stout man

Tha kept thy eyes open Little Ann he said And the way thas put
it down is a credit to thee And Ill lay a sovereign that tha made no
mistakes in what tha thought I was thinking

He was a little anxious to hear what it had been The memorandum had
brought him up with a slight shock because it showed him that he had
not remembered certain points and had passed over others which were of
dangerous importance Ann slipped her warm arm about his neck as she
nearly always did when she sat on the arm of his chair and talked things
over with him She had never thought in fact she was not even aware
that her soft little instincts made her treat him as the big good
conceited blundering child nature had created him

What I was seeing all the time was the way you were taking in his
trick of putting whole lots of things in that didnt really matter and
leaving out things that did she explained He kept talking about
what the invention would make in England and how it would make it and
adding up figures and per cents and royalties until my head was buzzing
inside And when he thought hed got your mind fixed on England so that
youd almost forget there was any other country to think of he read out
the agreement that said All rights and he was silly enough to think
he could get you to sign it without reading it over and over yourself
and showing it to a clever lawyer that would know that as many tricks
can be played by things being left out of a paper as by things being put
in

Small beads of moisture broke out on the bald part of Joseph
Hutchinsons head He had been first so flattered and exhilarated by the
quoting of large figures and then so flustrated and embarrassed by his
inability to calculate and follow argument and again so soothed and
elated and thrilled by his own importance in the scheme and the honors
which his position in certain companies would heap upon him that an
abyss had yawned before him of which he had been wholly unaware He was
not unaware of it now He was a vainglorious ignorant man whose life
had been spent in common work done under the supervision of those who
knew what he did not know He had fed himself upon the comforting belief
that he had learned all the tricks of any trade He had been openly
boastful of his astuteness and experience and yet as Anns soft little
voice went on and she praised his cleverness in seeing one point after
another he began to quake within himself before the dawning realization
that he had seen none of them that he had been carried along exactly
as Rosenthal had intended that he should be and that if luck had not
intervened he had been on the brink of signing his name to an agreement
that would have implied a score of concessions he would have bellowed
like a bull at the thought of making if he had known what he was doing

Aye lass he gulped out when he could speakaye lass tha wert
right enow Im glad tha wert there and heard it and saw what I was
thinking I didnt say much I let the chap have rope enow to hang
himself with When he comes back Ill give him a bit o my mind asll
startle him It was rightdown clever of thee to see just what I had i
my head about all that there gab about things as didnt matter an the
leavin out them as didthinking I wouldnt notice Manys the time
Ive said It is na so much whats put into a contract as whats left
out Ill warrant thast heard me say it thysen

I dare say I have answered Ann and I dare say that was why it came
into my mind

That was it he answered Thy mother was always tellin me of things
Id said that Id clean forgot myself

He was beginning to recover his balance and selfrespect It would have
been so like a Lancashire chap to have seen and dealt shrewdly with a
business schemer who tried to outwit him that he was gradually convinced
that he had thought all that had been suggested and had comported
himself with triumphant though silent astuteness He even began to rub
his hands

Ill show him he said Ill send him off with a flea in his ear

If youll help me Ill study out the things Ive written down on this
paper Ann said and then Ill write down for you just the things you
make up your mind to say It will be such a good lesson for me if you
dont mind Father It wont be much to write it out the way youll say
it You know how you always feel that in business the fewer words the
better and that however much a person deserves it calling names and
showing youre angry is only wasting time One of the cleverest things
you ever thought was that a thief doesnt mind being called one if hes
got what he wanted out of you hell only laugh to see you in a rage
when you cant help yourself And if he hasnt got what he wanted its
only waste of strength to work yourself up Its you being what you are
that makes you know that temper isnt business

Well said Hutchinson drawing a long and deep breath I was almost
hot enough to have forgot that and Im glad youve reminded me Well
go over that paper now Ann Id like to give you your lesson while
weve got a bit o time to ourselves and what Ive said is fresh in your
mind The trick is always to get at things while theyre fresh in your
mind

The little daughter with the red hair was present during Rosenthals
next interview with the owner of the invention The fellow he told
himself had been thinking matters over had perhaps consulted a lawyer
and having had time for reflection he did not present a mass of mere
inflated and blundering vanity as a target for adroit aim He seemed a
trifle sulky but he did not talk about himself diffusely and lose
his head when he was smoothed the right way He had a set of curiously
concise notes to which he referred and he stuck to his points with a
bulldog obstinacy which was not to be shaken Something had set him on
a new tack The tricks which could be used only with a totally ignorant
and readily flattered and influenced business amateur were no longer in
order This was baffling and irritating

The worst feature of the situation was that the daughter did not read a
book as had seemed her habit at other times She sat with a tablet and
pencil on her knee and still as unobtrusively as ever jotted down
notes

Put that down Ann her father said to her more than once Theres no
objections to having things written down I suppose he put it bluntly
to Rosenthal Ive got to have notes made when Im doing business
Memorys all well enough but black and whites better No one can go
back of black and white Notes save time

There was but one attitude possible No man of business could resent
the recording of his considered words but the tablet and pencil and the
quietly bent red head were extraordinary obstacles to the fluidity of
eloquence Rosenthal found his arguments less ready and his methods
modifying themselves The outlook narrowed itself When he returned to
his office and talked the situation over with his partner he sat and
bit his nails in restless irritation

Ridiculous as it seems outrageously ridiculous Ive an idea he
said Ive more than an idea that we have to count with the girl

Girl What girl

Daughter Wellbehaved quiet bit of a thing who sits in a corner
and listens while she pretends to sew or read Im certain of it Shes
taken to making notes now and Hutchinsons turned stubborn You need
not laugh Lewis Shes in it Weve got to count with that girl little
female mouse as she looks

This view which was first taken by Rosenthal and passed on to his
partner was in course of time passed on to others and gradually
accepted sometimes reluctantly and with much private protest
sometimes with amusement The wellbehaved daughter went with
Hutchinson wheresoever his affairs called him She was changeless in the
unobtrusiveness of her demeanor which was always that of a dutiful and
obedient young person who attended her parent because he might desire
her humble little assistance in small matters

Shes my secretary Hutchinson began to explain with a touch of
swagger Ive got to have a secretary and Id rather trust my private
business to my own daughter than to any one else Its safe with her

It was so safe with her steady demureness that Hutchinson found himself
becoming steady himself The lessons he gave to Little Ann and the
notes made as a result always ostensibly for her own security and
instruction began to form a singularly firm foundation for statement
and argument He began to tell himself that his memory was improving
Facts were no longer jumbled together in his mind He could better
follow a line of logical reasoning He less often grew red and hot and
flustered

Thats the thing Ive said so oftenthat tempers got naught to do wi
business and only upsets a man when he wants all his wits about
him Its the truest thing I ever worked out he not infrequently
congratulated himself If a chap can keep his temper hell be like to
keep his head and drive his bargain I see it plainer every day o my
life




CHAPTER XXXVI


It was in the course of the lessons that he realized that he had
always argued that the best way to do business was to do it face to face
with people To stay in England and let another chap make your bargains
for you in France or Germany or some other outlandish place where
frogeating foreigners ran loose was a fools trick Hed said it often
enough Get your eye on em and let them know youve got it on them
and theyd soon find out they were dealing with Lancashire and not with
foreign knaves and nincompoops So when it became necessary to deal
with France Little Ann packed him up neatly so to speak and in the
role of obedient secretarial companion took him to that country having
for weeks beforehand mentally confronted the endless complications
attending the step She knew in the first place what the effect of the
French language would be upon his temper that it would present itself
to him as a wall deliberately built by the entire nation as a means of
concealing a deep duplicity the sole object of which was the baffling
thwarting and undoing of Englishmen from whom it wished to wrest their
honest rights Apoplexy becoming imminent as a result of his impotent
rage during their first few days in Paris she paid a private visit to a
travelers agency and after careful inquiry discovered that it was not
impossible to secure the attendance and service of a wellmannered young
man who spoke most of the languages employed by most of the inhabitants
of the globe She even found that she might choose from a number of such
persons and she therefore selected with great care

One thats got a good temper and isnt easy irritated she said to
herself in summing up the aspirants but not one thats easytempered
because hes silly He must have plenty of common sense as well as be
willing to do what hes told

When her father discovered that he himself had been considering the
desirability of engaging the services of such a person and had indeed
already in a way expressed his intention of sending her to the agency
chap to look him up she was greatly relieved

I can try to teach him what youve taught me Father she said and
of course hell learn just by being with you

The assistant engaged was a hungry young student who had for weeks
through ill luck been endeavoring to return with some courage the gaze
of starvation which had been staring him in the face

His name was Dudevant and with desperate struggles he had educated
himself highly having cherished literary ambitions from his infancy At
this juncture it had become imperative that he should for a few months
at least obtain food Ann had chosen well by instinct His speech had
told her that he was intelligent his eyes had told her that he would do
anything on earth to earn his living

From the time of his advent Joseph Hutchinson had become calmer and had
ceased to be in peril of apoplectic seizure Foreign nations became
less iniquitous and dangerous foreign languages were less of a barrier
easier to understand A pleasing impression that through great facility
he had gained a fair practical knowledge of French German and Italian
supported and exhilarated him immensely

Its rightdown wonderful how a chap gets to understand these fellows
lingo after hes listened to it a bit he announced to Ann I wouldnt
have believed it of myself that I could see into it as quick as I have
I couldnt say as I understand everything they say just when theyre
saying it but I understand it right enough when Ive had time to
translate like If foreigners didnt talk so fast and run their words
one into another and jabber as if their mouths was full of puddin
itd be easier for them as is English Now theres wee and nong I
know em whenever I hear em and thats a good bit of help

Yes answered Ann of course thats the chief thing you want to know
in business whether a person is going to say yes or no

He began to say wee and nong at meals and once broke forth Passy
mor le burr in a tone so casually Parisian that Ann was frightened
because she did not understand immediately and also because she saw
looming up before her a future made perilous by the sudden interjection
of unexpected foreign phrases it would be incumbent upon her and
Dudevant to comprehend instantaneously without invidious hesitation

Dont you understand Pass the butter Dont you understand a bit o
French like that he exclaimed irritatedly Buy yourself one o these
books full of easy sentences and learn some of em lass You oughtnt
to be travelin about with your father in foreign countries and learnin
nothin Its not every lass thats gettin your advantages

Ann had not mentioned the fact that she spent most of her rare leisure
moments in profound study of phrasebooks and grammars which she kept
in her trunk and gave her attention to before she got up in the morning
after she went to her room at night and usually while she was dressing
You can keep a book open before you when you are brushing your hair
Dudevant gave her a lesson or so whenever time allowed She was as
quick to learn as her father thought he was and she was desperately
determined It was really not long before she understood much more than
wee and nong when she was present at a business interview

You are a wonderful young lady Dudevant said with that wellknown
yearning in his eyes You are most wonderful

Shes just a wonder Mrs Bowse and her boarders had said And the
respectful yearning in the young Frenchmans eyes and voice were well
known to her because she had seen it often before and remembered it
in Jem Bowles and Julius Steinberger That this young man had without an
hour of delay fallen abjectly in love with her was a circumstance with
which she dealt after her own inimitably kind and undeleterious method
which in itself was an education to any amorous youth

I can understand all you tell me she said when he reached the point
of confiding his hard past to her I can understand it because I knew
some one who had to fight for himself just that way only perhaps it was
harder because he wasnt educated as you are

Did heconfide in you Dudevant ventured with delicate hesitation
You are so kind I am sure he did Mademoiselle

He told me about it because he knew I wanted to hear she answered
I was very fond of him she added and her kind gravity was quite
unshaded by any embarrassment I was rightdown fond of him

His emotion rendered him for a moment indiscreet to her immediate
realization and regret as was evident by his breaking off in the midst
of his question

And noware you

Yes I always shall be Mr Dudevant

His adoration naturally only deepened itself as all hope at once
receded as it could not but recede before the absolute pellucid truth
of her

However much he likes me he will get over it in time People do when
they know how things stand she was thinking with maternal sympathy

It did him no bitter harm to help her with her efforts at learning
what she most needed and he found her intelligence and modest power
of concentration remarkable A singularly clear knowledge of her own
specialized requirements was a practical background to them both She
had no desire to shine she was merely steadily bent on acquiring as
immediately as possible a comprehension of nouns verbs and phrases
that would be useful to her father The manner in which she applied
herself and assimilated what it was her quietly fixed intention to
assimilate bespoke her possession of a brain the powers of which being
concentrated on large affairs might have accomplished almost startling
results There was however nothing startling in her intentions and
ambition did not touch her Yet as she went with Hutchinson from one
country to another more than one man of affairs had it borne in upon
him that her young slimness and her silence represented an unanticipated
knowledge of points under discussion which might wisely be considered
as a factor in all decisions for or against To realize that a
softcheeked childeyed girl was an element to regard privately in
discussions connected with the sale of or the royalties paid on a
valuable patent appeared in some minds to be a situation not without
flavor She was the kind of little person a man naturally made love to
and a girl who was made love to in a clever manner frequently became
amenable to reason and might be persuaded to use her influence in the
direction most desired But such male financiers as began with this idea
discovered that they had been led into errors of judgment through lack
of familiarity with the variations of type One personable young man
of title who had just been disappointed in a desirable marriage with
a fortune being made aware that the invention was likely to arrive at
amazing results was sufficiently rash to approach Mr Hutchinson with
formal proposals Having a truly British respect for the lofty in
place and not being sufficiently familiar with titled personages to
discriminate swiftly between the large and the small Joseph Hutchinson
was somewhat unduly elated

The chaps a count lass he said Thaud go back to Manchester a
countess

Ive heard theyre nearly all counts in these countries commented
Ann And theres countesses that have to do their own washing in a
manner of speaking You send him to me Father

When the young man came and compared the fine little nose of Miss
Hutchinson with the large and bony structure dominating the countenance
of the German heiress he had lost also when he gazed into the clearness
of the infantile blue eyes his spirits rose He felt himself en veine
he was equal to attacking the situation He felt that he approached it
with alluring and chivalric delicacy He almost believed all that he
said

But the pellucid blueness of the gaze that met his was confusingly
unstirred by any shade of suitable timidity or emotion There
was something in the lovely sedate little creature something so
undisturbed and matter of fact that it frightened him because he
suddenly felt like a fool whose folly had been found out

Thats downright silly remarked Little Ann not allowing him to
escape from her glance which unhesitatingly summed up him and his
situation And you know it is You dont know anything about me and
you wouldnt like me if you did And I shouldnt like you Were too
different Please go away and dont say anything more about it I
shouldnt have patience to talk it over

Father she said that night if ever I get married at all theres
only one person Im going to marry You know that And she would say no
more

By the time they returned to England the placing of the invention in
divers countries had been arranged in a manner which gave assurance of
a fortune for its owners on a foundation not likely to have established
itself in more adverse circumstances Mr Hutchinson had really driven
some admirable bargains and had secured advantages which to his last
hour he would believe could have been achieved only by Lancashire
shrewdness and Lancashire ability to see as far through a milestone
as most chaps an a bit farther The way in which he had never allowed
himself to be done caused him at times to chuckle himself almost
purple with selfcongratulation

They got to know what they was dealing with them chaps They was
sharp but Joe was a bit sharper he would say

They found letters waiting for them when they reached London

Theres one fro thy grandmother Hutchinson said in dealing out the
package Shes written to thee pretty steady for an old un

This was true Letters from her had followed them from one place to
another This was a thick one in an envelop of good size

Arent tha going to read it he asked

Not till youve had your dinner Father Youve had a long day of it
with that channel at the end I want to see you comfortable with your
pipe

The hotel was a good one and the dinner was good Joseph Hutchinson
enjoyed it with the appetite of a robust man who has had time to get
over a not too pleasant crossing When he had settled down into a stout
easychair with the pipe he drew a long and comfortable breath as he
looked about the room

Eh Ann lass he said thy mother d be fine an set up if she could
see aw this Us having the best thats to be had an knowin we can
have it to the end of our lives thats what its come to tha knows No
more thirdclass railwaycarriages for you and me No more commercial
an temperance hotels Th first cuts what we can haveth upper
cut Eh eh but its a good day for a man when hes begun to be
appreciated as he should be

Its a good day for those that love him said Little Ann And I dare
say mother knows every bit about it

I dare say she does admitted Hutchinson with tender lenience She
was one o them as believed that way And I never knowed her to be wrong
in aught else so Im ready to give in as she was reet about that Good
lass she was good lass

He had fallen into a contented and utterly comfortable doze in his chair
when Ann sat down to read her grandmothers letter The old woman always
wrote at length giving many details and recording village events with
shrewd realistic touches Throughout their journeyings Ann had been
followed by a record of the estate and neighborhood of Temple Barholm
which had lacked nothing of atmosphere She had known what the new lord
of the manor did what people said what the attitude of the gentry had
become that the visit of the Countess of Mallowe and her daughter had
extended itself until curiosity and amusement had ceased to comment
and passively awaited results She had heard of Miss Alicia and her
reincarnation and knew much of the story of the Duke of Stone whose
reputation as a dommed clever owd chap had earned for him a sort of
awed popularity There had been many ladies The new Temple Barholm
had boldly sought them out and faced them in their strongholds with the
manner of one who would confront the worst and who revealed no tendency
to flinch The one at Stone Hover with the pretty color and the one
with the dimples had appeared frequently upon the scene Then there had
been Lady Joan Fayre who had lived at his elbow sitting at his table
driving in his carriages with the air of cold aloofness which the
cottagers could na abide an had no patience wi She had sometimes
sat and wondered and wondered about things and sometimes had flushed
daisyred instead of daisypink and sometimes she had turned rather
pale and closed her soft mouth firmly But though she had written twice
a week to her grandmother she had recorded principally the successes
and complexities of the invention and had asked very few questions
Old Mrs Hutchinson would tell her all she must know and her choice of
revelation would be made with a farsightedness which needed no stimulus
of questioning The letter she had found awaiting her had been long on
its way having missed her at point after point and followed her at last
to London It looked and felt thick and solid in its envelop Little Ann
opened it stirred by the suggestion of quickened pulsebeats with which
she had become familiar As she bent over it she looked sweetly flushed
and warmed



Joseph Hutchinsons doze had almost deepened into sleep when he was
awakened by the touch of her hand on his shoulder She was standing by
him holding some sheets of her grandmothers letter and several other
sheets were lying on the table Something had occurred which had changed
her quiet look

Has aught happened to your grandmother he asked

No Father but this letter thats been following me from one place to
another has got some queer news in it

Whats up lass Tha looks as if summat was up

The thing thats happened has given me a great deal to think of was
her answer Its about Mr Temple Barholm and Mr Strangeways

He became wideawake at once sitting up and turning in his chair in
testy anxiety

Now now he exclaimed I hope that cracked chaps not gone out an
out mad an done some mischief I towd Temple Barholm it was a foolish
thing to do taking all that trouble about him Has he set fire to th
house or has he knocked th poor lad on th head

No he hasnt Father Hes disappeared and Mr Temple Barholms
disappeared too

Disappeared Hutchinson almost shouted What for i the Lords
name

Nobody knows for certain and people are talking wild The village is
all upset and all sorts of silly things are being said

What sort o things

You know what servants at big houses arehow they hear bits of
talk and make much of it she explained Theyve been curious and
chattering among themselves about Mr Strangeways from the first It was
Burrill that said he believed he was some relation that was being hid
away for some good reason One night Mr Temple Barholm and Captain
Palliser were having a long talk together and Burrill was about

Aye hed be about if he thought there was a chance of him hearing
summat as was none of his business jerked out Hutchinson irately

They were talking about Mr Strangeways and Burrill heard Captain
Palliser getting angry and as he stepped near the door he heard him say
out loud that he could swear in any court of justice that the man he had
seen at the west room windowits a startling thing Fatherwas Mr
James Temple Barholm For the moment her face was pale

Hereupon Hutchinson sprang up

What His second shout was louder than his first Th liar Th
chaps dead an he knows it Th dommed mischiefmakin liar

Her eyes were clear and speculatively thoughtful notwithstanding her
lack of color

There have been people that have been thought dead that have come
back to their friends alive Its happened many a time she said It
wouldnt be so strange for a man that had no friends to be lost in a
wild faroff place where there was neither law nor order and where
every man was fighting for his own life and the gold he was mad after
Particularly a man that was shamed and desperate and wanted to hide
himself And most of all it would be easy if he was like Mr
Strangeways and couldnt remember and had lost himself

As her father listened the angry redness of his countenance moderated
its hue His eyes gradually began to question and his under jaw fell
slightly

Si thee lass he broke out huskily does that mean to say tha
believes it

Its not often you can believe what you dont know she answered I
dont know anything about it Theres just one thing I believe because
I know it I believe what grandmother does Read that

She handed him the final sheet of old Mrs Hutchinsons letter It was
written with very black ink and in an astonishingly bold and clear hand
It was easy to read the sentences with which she ended



Theres a lot said Theres always more saying than doing But its
rightdown funny to see how the lad has made hard and fast friends just
going about in his queer way and no one knowing how he did it I
like him myself Hes one of those you neednt ask questions about If
theres anything said that isnt to his credit its not true Theres
no ifs buts or ands about that Ann



Little Ann herself read the words as her father read them

Thats the thing I believe because I know it was all she said

Its the thing Id swear to mysel her father answered bluffly But
by Judd

She gave him a little push and spoke to him in homely Lancashire
phrasing and with some soft unsteadiness of voice

Sit thee down Father love she said and let me sit on thy knee

He sat down with emotional readiness and she sat on his stout knee like
a child It was a thing she did in tender or troubled moments as much
in these days as she had done when she was six or seven Her little
lightness and soft young ways made it the most natural thing in the
world as well as the prettiest She had always sat on his knee in the
hours when he had been most discouraged over the invention She had
known it made him feel as though he were taking care of her and as
though she depended utterly on him to steady the foundations of her
world What could such a little bit of a lass do without a father

Its upset thee lass he said Its upset thee

He saw her slim hands curl themselves into small firm fists as they
rested on her lap

I cant bear to think that ill can be said of him even by a wastrel
like Captain Palliser she said Hes MINE

It made him fumble caressingly at her big knot of soft red hair

Thine is he he said Thine Eh but tha did say that just like
thy mother would ha said it tha brings the heart i my throat now and
again That chaps i luck I can tell himsame as I was once

Hes mine now whatever happens she went on with a firmness which
no skeptic would have squandered time in the folly of hoping to shake
Hes done what I told him to do and its ME he wants Hes found out
for himself and so have I He can have me the minute he wants methe
very minute

He can said Hutchinson That settles it I believe thad rather take
him when he was i trouble than when he was out of it Same as thad
rather take him i a flat in Harlem on fifteen dollar a week than on
fifteen hundred

Yes Father I would Itd give me more to do for him

Eh eh he grunted tenderly thy mother again I used to tell her as
the only thing she had agen me was that I never got i jail so she could
get me out an stand up for me after it Theres only one thing worrits
me a bit I wish the lad hadnt gone away

Ive thought that out though Ive not had much time to reason
about things said Little Ann If hes gone away hes gone to get
something and whatever it happens to be hell be likely to bring it
back with him Father




CHAPTER XXXVII


Old Mrs Hutchinsons letter had supplied much detail but when her son
and granddaughter arrived in the village of Temple Barholm they heard
much more the greater part of it not in the least to be relied upon

The most of its lies as folks enjoys theirsels pretendin to
believe the grandmother commented Its servantshall talk and
cottage gossip and plenty made itself up out o beer drunk in th
taproom at th Wool Park In a place where naught much happens people
get into th way o springin on a bit o news and shakin and worryin
it like a terrier does a rat Its nature That lads given em lots to
talk about ever since he coom Hes been a blessin to em If hed been
gentry hed not ha been nigh as lively Th village lads tries to talk
through their noses like him Little Tummas Hibblethwaite does it i
broad Lancashire

The only facts fairly authenticated were that the mysterious stranger
had been taken away very late one night some time before the interview
between Mr Temple Barholm and Captain Palliser of which Burrill knew
so much because he had happened to be about When a domestic magnate
of Burrills type happens to be about at a crisis he is not unlikely
to hear a great deal Burrill it was believed knew much more than
he deigned to make public The entire truth was that Captain Palliser
himself in one of his hasty appearances in the neighborhood of Temple
Barholm had bestowed a few words of cold caution on him

Dont talk too much he had said Proof is required before talk is
safe The American was sharp enough to say that to me himself He was
sharp enough too to keep his man hidden I was the only person that
saw him who could have recognized him and I saw him by chance Palford
 Grimby require proof We are in search of it Servants will talk
but if you dont want to run the risk of getting yourself into trouble
dont make absolute statements

This had been a disappointment to Burrill who had seen himself
developing in magnitude but he was a timid man and therefore felt it
wise to convey his knowledge merely through the conviction carried by
a dignified silence after his first indiscreet revelation of having
happened to be about had been made It would have been some solace
to him to intimate to Miss Alicia by his bearing and the manner of his
services that she had been discovered so to speak in the character of
a sort of accomplice that her position was a perilously uncertain one
which would probably end in utter downfall leaving her in her old
and proper place as an elderly insignificant and unattractive poor
relation without a feature to recommend her But being as before
remarked a timid man and recalling the interview between himself
and his employer held outside the diningroom door and having also a
disturbing memory of the sharp cool boyish eye and the tone of the
casual remark that he had a head on his shoulders and that it was up
to him to make the others understand it seemed as well to restrain his
inclinations until the proof Palford  Grimby required was forthcoming

It was perhaps the moderate and precautionary attitude of Palford 
Grimby during their first somewhat startled though reserved interview
with Captain Palliser which had prevented the vaguely wild rumors
from being regarded as more than villagers exaggerated talk among
themselves The gentry indeed knew much less of the cottagers than
the cottagers knew of the gentry consequently events furnishing much
excitement among the village people not infrequently remained unheard
of by those in the class above them A story less incredible might
have been more considered but the highly colored reasons given for the
absence of the owner of Temple Barholm would if heard of have been
more than likely to be received and passed over with a smile

The manner of Mr Palford and also of Mr Grimby during the deliberately
unmelodramatic and carefully connected relation of Captain Pallisers
singular story was that of professional gentlemen who for reasons
of good breeding were engaged in restraining outward expression of
conviction that they were listening to utter nonsense Palliser himself
was aware of this and upon the whole did not wonder at it in entirely
unimaginative persons of extremely sober lives In fact he had begun
by giving them some warning as to what they might expect in the way of
unusualness

You will no doubt think what I am about to tell you absurd and
incredible he had prefaced his statements I thought the same myself
when my first suspicions were aroused I was in fact inclined to laugh
at my own idea until one link connected itself with another

Neither Mr Grimby nor Mr Palford was inclined to laugh On the
contrary they were extremely grave and continued to find it necessary
to restrain their united tendency to indicate facially that the thing
must be nonsense It transcended all bounds as it were The delicacy
with which they managed to convey this did them much credit This
delicacy was equaled by the moderation with which Captain Palliser drew
their attention to the fact that it was not the thing likelytohappen
on which were founded the celebrated criminal cases of legal history
it was the incredible and almost impossible events the ordinarily
unbelievable duplicities moral obliquities and coincidences which made
them what they were and attracted the attention of the world This Mr
Palford and his partner were obviously obliged to admit What they did
not admit was that such things never having occurred in ones own world
they had been mentally relegated to the world of newspaper and criminal
record as things that could not happen to oneself Mr Palford cleared
his throat in a seriously cautionary way

This is of course a matter suggesting too serious an accusation not
to be approached in the most conservative manner he remarked

Most serious consequences have resulted in cases implying libelous
assertions which have been made rashly added Mr Grimby As Mr
Temple Barholm intimated to you a man of almost unlimited means has
command of resources which it might not be easy to contend with if he
had reason to feel himself injured

The fact that Captain Palliser had in a bitterly frustrated moment
allowed himself to be goaded into losing his temper and giving away
to Tembarom the discovery on which he had felt that he could rely as
a lever did not argue that a like weakness would lead him into more
dangerous indiscretion He had always regarded himself as a careful man
whose defenses were well built about him at such crises in his career
as rendered entrenchment necessary There would of course be some
pleasure in following the matter up and getting more than even with a
man who had been insolent to him but a more practical feature of the
case was that if through his alert observation and shrewd aid Jem
Temple Barholm was restored to his muchtobeenvied place in the
world a far from unnatural result would be that he might feel suitable
gratitude and indebtedness to the man who not from actual personal
liking but from a mere sense of justice had rescued him As for the
fears of Messrs Palford  Grimby he had put himself on record with
Burrill by commanding him to hold his tongue and stating clearly that
proof was both necessary and lacking No man could be regarded as
taking risks whose attitude was so wholly conservative and nonaccusing
Servants will gossip A superior who reproves such gossip holds an
unattackable position In the private room of Palford  Grimby however
he could confidently express his opinions without risk

The recognition of a man lost sight of for years and seen only for a
moment through a window is not substantial evidence Mr Grimby had
proceeded The incident was startling but not greatly to be relied
upon

I knew him Palliser was slightly grim in his air of finality He was
a man most men either liked or hated I didnt like him I detested a
trick he had of staring at you under his drooping lids By the way do
you remember the portrait of Miles Hugo which was so like him

Mr Palford remembered having heard that there was a certain portrait in
the gallery which Mr James Temple Barholm had been said to resemble He
had no distinct recollection of the ancestor it represented

It was a certain youngster who was a page in the court of Charles the
Second and who died young Miles Hugo Charles James was his name He
is my strongest clue The American seemed rather keen the first time we
talked together He was equally keen about Jem Temple Barholm He wanted
to know what he looked like and whether it was true that he was like
the portrait

Indeed exclaimed Palford and Grimby simultaneously

It struck me that there was something more than mere curiosity in his
manner Palliser enlarged I couldnt make him out then Later I
began to see that he was remarkably anxious to keep every one from
Strangeways It was a sort of Man in the Iron Mask affair Strangeways
was apparently not only too excitable to be looked at or spoken to but
too excitable to be spoken of He wouldnt talk about him

That is exceedingly curious remarked Mr Palford but it was not
in response to Palliser A few moments before he had suddenly looked
thoughtful He wore now the aspect of a man trying to recall something
as Palliser continued

One day after I had been to look at a sunset through a particular
window in the wing where Strangeways was kept I passed the door of his
sittingroom and heard the American arguing with him He was evidently
telling him he was to be taken elsewhere and the poor devil was
terrified I heard him beg him for Gods sake not to send him away
There was panic in his voice In connection with the fact that he has
got him away secretlyat midnightits an ugly thing to recall

It would seem to have significance Grimby said it uneasily

It set me thinking and looking into things Palliser went on Pearson
was secretive but the head man Burrill made casual enlightening
remarks I gathered some curious details which might or might not have
meant a good deal When Strangeways suddenly appeared at his window one
evening a number of things fitted themselves together My theory is that
the AmericanTembarom as he used to call himselfmay not have
been certain of the identity at first but he wouldnt have brought
Strangeways with him if he had not had some reason to suspect who he
was He darent lose sight of him and he wanted time to make sure and
to lay his plans The portrait of Miles Hugo was a clue which alarmed
him and no doubt he has been following it If he found it led to
nothing he could easily turn Strangeways over to the public charge and
let him be put into a lunatic asylum If he found it led to a revelation
which would make him a pauper again it would be easy to dispose of
him

Come Come Captain Palliser We mustnt go too far ejaculated Mr
Grimby alarmedly It shocked him to think of the firm being dragged
into a case dealing with capital crime and possible hangmen That was
not its line of the profession

Captain Pallisers slight laugh contained no hint of being shocked by
any possibilities whatever

There are extremely private asylums and socalled sanatoriums where the
discipline is strict and no questions are asked One sometimes reads
in the papers of cases in which mildmannered keepers in defending
themselves against the attacks of violent patients are obliged to
use forcewith disastrous results It is in such places that our
investigations should begin

Dear me Dear me Mr Grimby broke out Isnt that going rather far
You surely dont think

Mr Tembaroms chief characteristic was that he was a practical
and direct person He would do what he had to do in exactly that
businesslike manner The inquiries I have been making have been as
to the whereabouts of places in which a superfluous relative might be
placed without attracting attention

That is really astute butbutwhat do you think Palford Mr
Grimby turned to his partner still wearing the shocked and disturbed
expression

I have been recalling to mind a circumstance which probably bears upon
the case said Mr Palford Captain Pallisers mention of the portrait
reminded me of it I remember now that on Mr Temple Barholms first
visit to the picturegallery he seemed much attracted by the portrait of
Miles Hugo He stopped and examined it curiously He said he felt as
if he had seen it before He turned to it once or twice and finally
remarked that he might have seen some one like it at a great fancydress
ball which had taken place in New York

Had he been invited to the ball laughed Palliser

I did not gather that replied Mr Palford gravely He had apparently
watched the arriving guests from some railings near byor perhaps it
was a lamppostwith other newsboys

He recognized the likeness to Strangeways no doubt and it gave
him what he calls a jolt said Captain Palliser He must have
experienced a number of jolts during the last few months

Palford  Grimbys view of the matter continued to be marked by extreme
distaste for the whole situation and its disturbing and irritating
possibilities The coming of the American heir to the estate of Temple
Barholm had been trying to the verge of extreme painfulness but
sufficient time having lapsed and their client having troubled them but
little they had outlived the shock of his first appearance and settled
once more into the calm of their accustomed atmosphere and routine That
he should suddenly reappear upon their dignified horizon as a probable
melodramatic criminal was a fault of taste and a lack of consideration
beyond expression To be draggedinto vulgar detective work to be
referred to in newspapers in a connection which would lead to confusing
the firm with the representatives of such branches of the profession as
dealt with persons who had committed acts for which in vulgar parlance
they might possibly swing if their legal defenders did not get them
off to a firm whose sole affairs had been the dealing with noble and
ancient estates with advising and supporting personages of stately
name and with private and weighty family confidences If the worst came
to the worst the affair would surely end in the most glaring and odious
notoriety in headlines and daily reports even in London in appalling
pictures of every one concerned in every New York newspaper even in
baffled struggles to keep abominable woodcuts of themselvesMr Edward
James Palford and Mr James Matthew Grimbyfrom being published in
sensational journalistic sheets Professional duty demanded that the
situation should be dealt with that investigation should be entered
into that the most serious even if conservative steps should be
taken at once With regard to the accepted report of Mr James Temple
Barholms tragic death it could not be denied that Captain Pallisers
view of the naturalness of the origin of the mistake that had been made
had a logical air

In a region full of rioting derelicts crazed with the lawless
excitement of their dash after gold he had said identities and
names are easily lost Temple Barholm himself was a derelict and in a
desperate state He was in no mood to speak of himself or try to make
friends He no doubt came and went to such work as he did scarcely
speaking to any one A mass of earth and debris of all sorts suddenly
gives way burying halfadozen men Two or three are dug out dead the
others not reached There was no time to spare to dig for dead men Some
one had seen Temple Barholm near the place he was seen no more Ergo
he was buried with the rest At that time those who knew him in England
felt it was the best thing that could have happened to him It would
have been if his valet had not confessed his trick and old Temple
Barholm had not died My theory is that he may have left the place days
before the accident without being missed His mental torment caused some
mental illness it does not matter what He lost his memory and wandered
aboutthe Lord knows how or where he lived he probably never knew
himself The American picked him up and found that he had money For
reasons of his own he professed to take care of him He must have come
on some clue just when he heard of his new fortune He was naturally
panicstricken it must have been a big blow at that particular moment
He was sharp enough to see what it might mean and held on to the poor
chap like grim death and has been holding on ever since

We must begin to take steps decided Palford  Grimby We must of
course take steps at once but we must begin with discretion

After grave private discussion they began to take the steps in question
and with the caution that it seemed necessary to observe until they felt
solid ground under their feet Captain Palliser was willing to assist
them He had been going into the matter himself He went down to the
neighborhood of Temple Barholm and quietly looked up data which might
prove illuminating when regarded from one point or another It was on
the first of these occasions that he saw and warned Burrill It was from
Burrill he heard of Tummas Hibblethwaite

Theres an impident little vagabond in the village sir he said
that Mr Temple Barholm used to go and see and take New York newspapers
to A cripple the lad is and hes got a kind of craze for talking about
Mr James Temple Barholm He had a map of the place where he was said
to be killed If I may presume to mention it sir he added with great
dignity it is my opinion that the two had a good deal of talk together
on the subject

I dare say Captain Palliser admitted indifferently and made no
further inquiry or remark

He sauntered into the Hibblethwaite cottage however late the next
afternoon

Tummas was in a bad temper for reasons quite sufficient for himself
and he regarded him sourly

What has tha coom for he demanded I did na ask thee

Dont be cheeky said Captain Palliser I will give you a sovereign
if youll let me see the map you and Mr Temple Barholm used to look at
and talk so much about

He laid the sovereign down on the small table by Tummass sofa but
Tummas did not pick it up

I know who tha art Thart Palliser an tha wast th one as said as
him as was killed in th Klondike had coom back alive

Youve been listening to that servants story have you remarked
Palliser You had better be careful as to what you say I suppose you
never heard of libel suits Where would you find yourself if you were
called upon to pay Mr Temple Barholm ten thousand pounds damages
Youd be obliged to sell your atlas

Burrill towd as he heard thee say thad swear in court as it was th
one as was killed as thad seen

Thats Burrills story not mine And Burrill had better keep his mouth
shut said Palliser If it were true how would you like it Ive
heard you were interested in th one as was killed

Tummass eyes burned troublously

Ive got reet down taken wi th other un he answered Hes noan
gentry but hes th reet mak II dunnot believe as him as was killed
has coom back

Neither do I Palliser answered with amiable tolerance The American
gentleman had better come back himself and disprove it When you used to
talk about the Klondike he never said anything to make you feel as if
he doubted that the other man was dead

Not him answered Tummas

Eh Tummas what art tha talkin about exclaimed Mrs Hibblethwaite
who was mending at the other end of the room I heerd him say mysel
Suppose th story hadnt been true an he was alive somewhere now itd
make a big change would na it An he laughed

I never heerd him said Tummas in stout denial

Thas losin tha moind commented his mother As soon as I heerd
th talk about him runnin away an takin th mad gentleman wi him I
remembered it An I remembered as he sat still after it and said nowt
for a minute or so same as if he was thinkin things over Theer was
summat a bit queer about it

I never heerd him Tummas asserted obstinately and shut his mouth

He were as ready to talk about th poor gentleman as met with th
accident as tha wert thysel Tummas Mrs Hibblethwaite proceeded
moved by the opportunity offered for presenting her views on the
exciting topic Hed ax thee aw sorts o questions about what thad
found out wi pumpin foak Hed ax me questions now an agen about
what he was loike to look at an how tall he wur Onct he axed me if I
remembered what soart o chin he had an how he spoke

It wur to set thee goin an please me volunteered Tummas
grudgingly He did it same as hed look at th map to please me an
tell me tales about th newslads i New York

It had not seemed improbable that a village cripple tied to a sofa would
be ready enough to relate all he knew and perhaps so much more that it
would be necessary to use discretion in selecting statements of value
To drop in and give him a sovereign and let him talk had appeared
simple Lads of his class liked to be listened to enjoyed enlarging
upon and rendering dramatic such material as had fallen into their
hands But Tummas was an eccentric and instinct led him to close like
an oyster before a remote sense of subtly approaching attack It was
his mother not he who had provided information but it was not
sufficiently specialized to be worth much

What did tha say hed run away fur Tummas said to his parent later
Hes not one o th runnin away soart

He has probably been called away by business remarked Captain
Palliser as he rose to go after a few minutes casual talk with Mrs
Hibblethwaite It was a mistake not to leave an address behind him
Your mother is mistaken in saying that he took the mad gentleman with
him He had him removed late at night some time before he went himself

Tak tha sovrin said Tummas as Palliser moved away I did na show
thee th atlas Tha did na want to see it

I will leave the sovereign for your mother said Palliser Im sorry
you are not in a better humor

His interest in the atlas had indeed been limited to his idea that it
would lead to subjects of talk which might cast illuminating sidelights
and possibly open up avenues and vistas Tummas however having
instinctively found him displeasing he had gained but little

Avenues and vistas were necessaryavenues through which the steps of
Palford and Grimby might wander vistas which they might explore
with hesitating investigating glances So far the scene remained
unpromisingly blank The American Temple Barholm had simply disappeared
as had his mysterious charge Steps likely to lead to definite results
can scarcely be taken hopefully in the case of a person who has seemed
temporarily to cease to exist You cannot interrogate him you cannot
demand information whatsoever the foundations upon which rest your
accusations if such accusation can be launched only into thin air and
the fact that there is nobody to reply toto acknowledge or indignantly
refute themis in itself a serious barrier to accomplishment It was
also true that only a few weeks had elapsed since the accused had so to
speak dematerialized It was also impossible to calculate upon what
an American of his class and peculiarities would be likely to do in any
circumstances whatever

In private conference Palford and Grimby frankly admitted to each other
that they would almost have preferred that Captain Palliser should have
kept his remarkable suspicions to himself for the time being at least
Yet when they had admitted this they were confronted by the disturbing
possibilitysuggested by Palliserthat actual crime had been or might
be committed They had heard unpleasant stories of private lunatic
asylums and their like Things to shudder at might be going on at
the very moment they spoke to each other Under this possibility no
supineness would be excusable Efforts to trace the missing man must at
least be made Efforts were made but with no result Painful as it was
to reflect on the subject of the asylums careful private inquiry was
made information was quietly collected there were even visits to
gruesomely quiet places on various polite pretexts

If a longer period of time had elapsed Mr Palford remarked several
times with some stiffness of manner we should feel that we had more
solid foundation for our premises

Perfectly right Captain Palliser agreed with him but it is lapse of
time which may mean life or death to Jem Temple Barholm so its perhaps
as well to be on the safe side and go on quietly following small clues
I dare say you would feel more comfortable yourselves

Both Mr Palford and Mr Grimby having made an appointment with
Miss Alicia arrived one afternoon at Temple Barholm to talk to her
privately thereby casting her into a state of agonized anxiety which
reduced her to pallor

Our visit is merely one of inquiry Miss Temple Barholm Mr Palford
began There is perhaps nothing alarming in our clients absence

In the note which he left me he asked me tofeel no anxiety Miss
Alicia said

He left you a note of explanation I wish we had known this earlier
Mr Palfords tone had the note of relieved exclamation Perhaps there
was an entirely simple solution of the painful difficulty

But his hope had been too sanguine

It was not a note of explanation exactly He went away too suddenly to
have time to explain

The two men looked at each other disturbedly

He had not mentioned to you his intention of going asked Mr Grimby

I feel sure he did not know he was going when he said goodnight He
remained with Captain Palliser talking for some time Miss Alicias
eyes held wavering and anxious question as she looked from one to the
other She wondered how much more than herself her visitors knew He
found a telegram when he went to his room It contained most disquieting
news about Mr Strangeways Hehe had got away from the place where

Got away Mr Palford was again exclamatory Was he in some
institution where he was kept under restraint

Miss Alicia was wholly unable to explain to herself why some quality in
his manner filled her with sudden distress

Oh I think not Surely not Surely nothing of that sort was necessary
He was very quiet always and he was getting better every day But it
was important that he should be watched over He was no doubt under the
care of a physician in some quiet sanatorium

Some quiet sanatorium Mr Palfords disturbance of mind was manifest
But you did not know where

No Indeed Mr Temple Barholm talked very little of Mr Strangeways I
believe he knew that it distressed me to feel that I could be of no real
assistance asas the case was so peculiar

Each perturbed solicitor looked again with rapid question at the other
Miss Alicia saw the exchange of glances and so to speak broke down
under the pressure of their unconcealed anxiety The last few weeks with
their suggestion of accusation too vague to be met had been too much for
her

I am afraidI feel sure you know something I do not she began I
am most anxious and unhappy I have not liked to ask questions because
that would have seemed to imply a doubt of Mr Temple Barholm I have
even remained at home because I did not wish to hear things I could not
understand I do not know what has been said Pearson in whom I have
the greatest confidence felt that Mr Temple Barholm would prefer that
I should wait until he returned

Do you think he will return said Mr Grimby amazedly

Oh the gentle creature ejaculated Can you possibly think he will
not Why Why

Mr Palford had shared his partners amazement It was obvious that she
was as ignorant as a babe of the details of Pallisers extraordinary
story In her affectionate consideration for Temple Barholm she had
actually shut herself up lest she should hear anything said against him
which she could not refute She stood innocently obedient to his wishes
like the boy upon the burning deck awaiting his return and his version
of whatsoever he had been accused of There was something delicately
heroic in the little slender old thing with her troubled eyes and her
cap and her quivering sideringlets

You she appealed are his legal advisers and will be able to tell
me if there is anything he would wish me to know I could not allow
myself to listen to villagers or servants but I may ask you

We are far from knowing as much as we desire to know Mr Palford
replied

We came here in fact added Grimby to ask questions of you Miss
Temple Barholm

The fact that Miss Temple Barholm has not allowed herself to be
prejudiced by village gossip which is invariably largely unreliable
will make her an excellent witness Mr Palford said to his partner
with a deliberation which held suggestive significance Each man
in fact had suddenly realized that her ignorance would leave her
absolutely unbiased in her answers to any questions they might put and
that it was much better in crossexamining an emotional elderly lady
that such should be the case

Witness Miss Alicia found the word alarming Mr Palfords bow was
apologetically palliative

A mere figure of speech madam he said

I really know so little every one else doesnt know Miss Alicias
protest had a touch of bewilderment in it What could they wish to ask
her

But as we understand it your relations with Mr Temple Barholm were
most affectionate and confidential

We were very fond of each other she answered

For that reason he no doubt talked to you more freely than to other
people Mr Grimby put it Perhaps Palford it would be as well to
explain to Miss Temple Barholm that a curious feature of this matter
is that itin a wayinvolves certain points concerning the late Mr
Temple Barholm

Miss Alicia uttered a pathetic exclamation

Poor Jemwho died so cruelly

Mr Palford bent his head in acquiescence

Perhaps you can tell me what the present Mr Temple Barholm knew of
himhow much he knew

I told him the whole story the first time we took tea together Miss
Alicia replied and between her recollection of that strangely happy
afternoon and her wonder at its connection with the present moment she
began to feel timid and uncertain

How did it seem to impress him

She remembered it all so wellhis queer dear New York way of
expressing his warmhearted indignation at the cruelty of what had
happened

Oh he was very much excited He was so sorry for him He wanted to
know everything about him He asked me what he looked like

Oh said Palford He wanted to know that

He was so full of sympathy she replied her explanation gaining
warmth When I told him that the picture of Miles Hugo in the gallery
was said to look like Jem as a boy he wanted very much to see it
Afterward we went and saw it together I shall always remember how he
stood and looked at it Most young men would not have cared But he
always had such a touching interest in poor Jem

You mean that he asked questions about himabout his death and so
forth was Mr Palfords inquiry

About all that concerned him He was interested especially in his looks
and manner of speaking and personality so to speak And in the awful
accident which ended his life though he would not let me talk about
that after he had asked his first questions

What kind of questions suggested Grimby

Only about what was known of the time and place and how the sad story
reached England It used to touch me to think that the only person who
seemed to care was the one whomight have been expected to be almost
glad the tragic thing had happened But he was not

Mr Palford watched Mr Grimby and Mr Grimby gave more than one
dubious and distressed glance at Palford

His interest was evident remarked Palford thoughtfully And unusual
under the circumstances

For a moment he hesitated then put another question Did he ever
seemI should say do you remember any occasion when he appeared to
think thatthere might be any reason to doubt that Mr James Temple
Barholm was one of the men who died in the Klondike

He felt that through this wild questioning they had at least reached a
certain testimony supporting Captain Pallisers views and his interest
reluctantly increased It was reluctant because there could be no shadow
of a question that this innocent spinster lady told the absolute truth
and this being the case one seemed to be dragged to the verge of
depths which must inevitably be explored Miss Alicias expression was
that of one who conscientiously searched memory

I do not remember that he really expressed doubt she answered
carefully Not exactly that but

But what prompted Palford as she hesitated Please try to recall
exactly what he said It is most important

The fact that his manner was almost eager and that eagerness was not
his habit made her catch her breath and look more questioning and
puzzled than before

One day he came to my sittingroom when he seemed rather excited she
explained He had been with Mr Strangeways who had been worse than
usual Perhaps he wanted to distract himself and forget about it He
asked me questions and talked about poor Jem for about an hour And
at last he said Do you suppose theres any sort of chance that it
mightnt be truethat story that came from the Klondike He said it so
thoughtfully that I was startled and said Do you think there could
be such a chancedo you And he drew a long breath and answered You
want to be sure about things like that youve got to be sure I was
a little excited so he changed the subject very soon afterward and I
never felt quite certain of what he was really thinking You see what he
said was not so much an expression of doubt as a sort of question

A touch of the lofty condemnatory made Mr Palford impressive

I am compelled to admit that I fear that it was a question of which he
had already guessed the answer he said

At this point Miss Alicia clasped her hands quite tightly together upon
her knees

If you please she exclaimed I must ask you to make things a
little clear to me What dreadful thing has happened I will regard any
communication as a most sacred confidence

I think we may as well Palford Mr Grimby suggested to his partner

Yes Palford acquiesced He felt the difficulty of a blank
explanation We are involved in a most trying position he said
We feel that great discretion must be used until we have reached more
definite certainty An extraordinaryin fact a startling thing has
occurred We are beginning as a result of cumulative evidence to
feel that there was reason to believe that the Klondike story was to be
doubted

That poor Jem cried Miss Alicia

One begins to be gravely uncertain as to whether he has not been
in this house for months whether he was not the mysterious Mr
Strangeways

Jem Jem gasped poor little Miss Temple Barholm quite white with
shock

And if he was the mysterious Strangeways Mr Grimby assisted to
shorten the matter the American Temple Barholm apparently knew the
fact brought him here for that reason and for the same reason kept him
secreted and under restraint

No No cried Miss Alicia Never Never I beg you not to say such a
thing Excuse meI cannot listen It would be wrongungrateful Excuse
me She got up from her seat trembling with actual anger in her sense
of outrage It was a remarkable thing to see the small elderly creature
angry but this remarkable thing had happened It was as though she were
a mother defending her young

I loved poor Jem and I love Temple and though I am only a woman who
never has been the least clever I know them both I know neither of
them could lie or do a wicked cunning thing Temple is the soul of
honor

It was quite an inspirational outburst She had never before in her life
said so much at one time Of course tears began to stream down her face
while Mr Palford and Mr Grimby gazed at her in great embarrassment

If Mr Strangeways was poor Jem come back alive Temple did not
knowhe never knew All he did for him was done for kindness sake
II It was inevitable that she should stammer before going to this
length of violence and that the words should burst from her I would
swear it

It was really a shock to both Palford and Grimby That a lady of Miss
Temple Barholms age and training should volunteer to swear to a thing
was almost alarming It was also in rather unpleasing taste

Captain Palliser obliged Mr Temple Temple Barholm to confess that he
had known for some time Mr Palford said with cold regret He also
informed him that he should communicate with us without delay

Captain Palliser is a bad man Miss Alicia choked back a gasp to make
the protest

It was after their interview that Mr Temple Barholm almost immediately
left the house

Without any explanation whatever added Grimby

He left a few lines for me defended Miss Alicia

We have not seen them Mr Palford was still as well as cold Poor
little Miss Alicia took them out of her pocket with an unsteady hand
They were always with her and she could not on such a challenge seem
afraid to allow them to be read Mr Palford took them from her with
a slight bow of thanks He adjusted his glasses and read aloud with
pauses between phrases which seemed somewhat to puzzle him



Dear little Miss Alicia

Ive got to light out of here as quick as I can make it I cant even
stop to tell you why Theres just one thingdont get rattled Miss
Alicia Whatever any one says or does dont get rattled

Yours affectionately

T TEMBAROM



There was a silence Mr Palford passed the paper to his partner who
gave it careful study Afterward he refolded it and handed it back to
Miss Alicia

In a court of law was Mr Palfords sole remark it would not be
regarded as evidence for the defendant

Miss Alicias tears were still streaming but she held her ringleted
head well up

I cannot stay I beg your pardon I do indeed she said But I must
leave you You see she added with her fine little touch of dignity
as yet this house is still Mr Temple Barholms home and I am the
grateful recipient of his bounty Burrill will attend you and make you
quite comfortable With an obeisance which was like a slight curtsey
she turned and fled

In less than an hour she walked up the neat bricked path and old Mrs
Hutchinson looking out saw her through the tiers of flowerpots in
the window Hutchinson himself was in London but Ann was reading at the
other side of the room

Heres poor little owd Miss Temple Barholm aw in a flutter remarked
her grandmother Thas got some work cut out for thee if thas going to
quiet her Oppen th door lass

Ann opened the door and stood by it with calm though welcoming dimples

Miss Hutchinson Miss Alicia began all at once to realize that they
did not know each other and that she had flown to the refuge of her
youth without being at all aware of what she was about to say Oh
Little Ann she broke down with frank tears My poor boy My poor
boy

Little Ann drew her inside and closed the door

There Miss Temple Barholm she said There now Just come in and sit
down Ill get you a good cup of tea You need one




CHAPTER XXXVIII


The Duke of Stone had been sufficiently occupied with one of his
slighter attacks of rheumatic gout to have been so to speak out of the
running in the past weeks His indisposition had not condemned him
to the usual dullness however He had suffered less pain than was
customary and Mrs Braddle had been more than usually interesting in
conversation on those occasions when in making him very comfortable in
one way or another she felt that a measure of entertainment would add
to his wellbeing His epicurean habit of mind tended toward causing
him to find a subtle pleasure in the hearing of various versions of any
story whatever His intimacy with T Tembarom had furnished forth many
an agreeable mental repast for him He had had T Tembaroms version of
himself the version of the county the version of the uneducated class
and his own version All of these had had varying shades of their own
He had found a cynically fine flavor in Pallisers version which he had
gathered through talk and processes of exclusion and inclusion

There is a good deal to be said for it he summed it up Its
plausible on ordinary sophisticated grounds T Tembarom would say It
looks sort of that way

As Mrs Braddle had done what she could in the matter of expounding her
views of the uncertainties of the village attitude he had listened
with stimulating interest Mrs Braddles version on the passing of T
Tembarom stood out picturesquely against the background of the version
which was his ownthe one founded on the singular facts he had shared
knowledge of with the chief character in the episode He had not like
Miss Alicia received a communication from Tembarom This seemed to him
one of the attractive features of the incident It provided opportunity
for speculation Some wild development had called the youngster away in
a rattling hurry Of what had happened since his departure he knew no
more than the villagers knew What had happened for some months before
his going he had watched with the feeling of an intelligently observant
spectator at a play He had been provided with varied emotions by the
fantastic drama He had smiled he had found himself moved once or
twice and he had felt a good deal of the thrill of curious uncertainty
as to what the curtain would rise and fall on The situation was such
that it was impossible to guess Results could seem only to float in the
air One thing might happen so might another so might a dozen more
What he wished really to attain was some degree of certainty as to what
was likely to occur in any case to the American Temple Barholm

He felt the first time he drove over to call on Miss Alicia that
his indisposition and confinement to his own house had robbed him of
something They had deprived him of the opportunity to observe shades of
development and to hear the expressing of views of the situation as it
stood He drove over with views of his own and with anticipations He
had reason to know that he would encounter in the dear lady indications
of the feeling that she had reached a crisis There was a sense of this
crisis impending as one mounted the terrace steps and entered the
hall The menservants endeavored to wipe from their countenances any
expression denoting even a vague knowledge of it He recognized
their laudable determination to do so Burrill was monumental in the
unconsciousness of his outward bearing

Miss Alicia sitting waiting on Fate in the library wore precisely the
aspect he had known she would wear She had been lying awake at night
and she had of course wept at intervals since she belonged to the
period the popular female view of which had been that only the unfeeling
did not so relieve themselves in crises of the affections Her eyelids
were rather pink and her nice little face was tired

It is very very kind of you to come she said when they shook hands
I wonder her hesitance was touching in its obvious appeal to him
not to take the wrong sideI wonder if you know how deeply troubled I
have been

You see I have had a touch of my abominable gout and my treasure of a
Braddle has been nursing me and gossiping he answered So of course
I know a great deal None of it true I dare say I felt I must come and
see you however

He looked so neat and entirely within the boundaries of finished and
welldressed modernity and everyday occurrence in his perfectly
fitting clothes beautifully shining boots and delicate fawn gaiters
that she felt a sort of support in his mere aspect The mind connected
such almost dapper freshness and excellent taste only with unexaggerated
incidents and a behavior which almost placed the stamp of absurdity upon
the improbable in circumstance The vision of disorderly and illegal
possibilities seemed actually to fade into an unreality

If Mr Palford and Mr Grimby knew him as I know himasas you know
him she added with a faint hopefulness

Yes if they knew him as we know him that would make a different matter
of it admitted the duke amiably But thought Miss Alicia he might
only have put it that way through consideration for her feelings and
because he was an extremely polished man who could not easily reveal to
a lady a disagreeable truth He did not speak with the note of natural
indignation which she thought she must have detected if he had felt as
she felt herself He was of course a man whose manner had always
the finish of composure He did not seem disturbed or even very
curiousonly kind and most polite

If we only knew where he was she began again If we only knew where
Mr Strangeways was

My impression is that Messrs Palford  Grimby will probably find
them both before long he consoled her They are no doubt exciting
themselves unnecessarily

He was not agitated at all she felt it would have been kinder if he
had been a little agitated He was really not the kind of person
whose feelings appeared very deep being given to a light and graceful
cynicism of speech which delighted people so perhaps it was not natural
that he should express any particular emotion even in a case affecting
a friendsurely he had been Temples friend But if he had seemed a
little distressed or doubtful or annoyed she would have felt that she
understood better his attitude As it was he might almost have been on
the other sidea believer or a disbelieveror merely a person looking
on to see what would happen When they sat down his glance seemed to
include her with an interest which was sympathetic but rather as if she
were a child whom he would like to pacify This seemed especially so
when she felt she must make clear to him the nature of the crisis which
was pending as he had felt when he entered the house

You perhaps do not knowthe appeal which had shown itself in her eyes
was in her voicethat the solicitors have decided after a great deal
of serious discussion and private inquiry in London that the time has
come when they must take open steps

In the matter of investigation he inquired

They are coming here this afternoon with Captain Palliser toto
question the servants and some of the villagers They will question
me alarmedly

They would be sure to do thathe really seemed quite to envelop her
with kindnessbut I beg of you not to be alarmed Nothing you could
have to say could possibly do harm to Temple Barholm He knew it was
her fear of this contingency which terrified her

You do feel sure of that she burst forth relievedly You
dobecause you know him

I do Let us be calm dear lady Let us be calm

I will I will she protested But Captain Palliser has arranged that
a lady should come herea lady who disliked poor Temple very much She
was most unjust to him

Lady Joan Fayre he suggested and then paused with a remote smile as
if lending himself for the moment to some humor he alone detected in the
situation

She will not injure his cause I think I can assure you

She insisted on misunderstanding him I am so afraid

The appearance of Pearson at the door interrupted her and caused her to
rise from her seat The neat young man was pale and spoke in a nervously
lowered voice

I beg pardon Miss I beg your Graces pardon for intruding but

Miss Alicia moved toward him in such a manner that he himself seemed to
feel that he might advance

What is it Pearson Have you anything special to say

I hope I am not taking too great a liberty Miss but I did come in for
a purpose knowing that his Grace was with you and thinking you might
both kindly advise me It is about Mr Temple Barholm your Grace
addressing him as if in involuntary recognition of the fact that he
might possibly prove the greater support

Our Mr Temple Barholm Pearson We are being told there are two
of them The dukes delicate emphasis on the possessive pronoun was
delightful and it so moved and encouraged sensitive little Pearson that
he was emboldened to answer with modest firmness

Yesours Thank you your Grace

You feel him yours too Pearson a shade more delightfully still

II take the liberty your Grace of being deeply attached to him and
more than grateful

What did you want to ask advice about

The family solicitors Captain Palliser and Lady Joan Fayre and Mr and
Miss Hutchinson are to be here shortly and I have been told I am to be
questioned What I want to know your Grace is He paused and looked
no longer pale but painfully red as he gathered himself together for his
anxious outburstMust I speak the truth

Miss Alicia started alarmedly

The duke looked down at the delicate fawn gaiters covering his fine
instep His fleeting smile was not this time an external one

Do you not wish to speak the truth Pearson

Pearsons manner could have been described only as one of obstinate
frankness

No your Grace I do not Your Grace may misunderstand mebut I do
not

His Grace tapped the gaiters with the slight ebony cane he held in his
hand

Is this he put it with impartial curiositybecause the truth might
be detrimental to our Mr Temple Barholm

If you please your Grace Pearson made a firm step forward what is
the truth

That is what Messrs Palford  Grimby seem determined to find out
Probably only our Mr Temple Barholm can tell them

Your Grace what Im thinking of is that if I tell the truth it may
seem to prove something thats not the truth

What kinds of things Pearson still impartially

I can be plain with your Grace Things like this I was with Mr Temple
Barholm and Mr Strangeways a great deal Theyll ask me about what I
heard Theyll ask me if Mr Strangeways was willing to go away to the
doctor if he had to be persuaded and argued with Well he had and he
hadnt your Grace At first just the mention of it would upset him so
that Mr Temple Barholm would have to stop talking about it and quiet
him down But when he improvedand he did improve wonderfully your
Gracehe got into the way of sitting and thinking it over and listening
quite quiet But if Im asked suddenly

What you are afraid of is that you may be asked pointblank questions
without warning his Grace put it with the perspicacity of experience

Thats why I should be grateful for advice Must I tell the truth your
Grace when it will make them believe things Id swear are liesId
swear it your Grace

So would I Pearson His serene lightness was of the most baffling
but curiously supporting order This being the case my advice would
be not to go into detail Let us tell white liesall of uswithout a
shadow of hesitancy Miss Temple Barholm even you must do your best

I will tryindeed I will try And the Duke felt her tremulously
ardent assent actually delicious

There well consider that settled Pearson he said

Thank you your Grace Thank you Miss Pearsons relieved gratitude
verged on the devout He turned to go and as he did so his attention
was arrested by an approach he remarked through a window

Mr and Miss Hutchinson are arriving now Miss he announced hastily

They are to be brought in here said Miss Alicia

The duke quietly left his seat and went to look through the window with
frank and unembarrassed interest in the approach He went in fact to
look at Little Ann and as he watched her walk up the avenue her
father lumbering beside her he evidently found her aspect sufficiently
arresting

Ah he exclaimed softly and paused What a lot of very nice red
hair he said next And then No wonder No wonder

That I should say he remarked as Miss Alicia drew near is what I
once heard a bad young man call a deserving case

He was conscious that she might have been privately a little shocked by
such aged flippancy but she was at the moment perturbed by something
else

The fact is that I have never spoken to Hutchinson she fluttered
These changes are very confusing I suppose I ought to say Mr
Hutchinson now that he is such a successful person and Temple

Without a shadow of a doubt The duke seemed struck by the happiness
of the idea They will make him a peer presently He may address me as
Stone at any moment One must learn to adjust ones self with agility
The old order changeth Ah she is smiling at him and I see the
dimples

Miss Alicia made a clean breast of it

I went to herI could not help it she confessed I was in such
distress and dare not speak to anybody Temple had told me that she was
so wonderful He said she always understood and knew what to do

Did she in this case he asked smiling

Miss Alicias manner was that of one who could express the extent of her
admiration only in disconnected phrases

She was like a little rock Such a quiet firm way Such calm
certainty Oh the comfort she has been to me I begged her to come here
today I did not know her father had returned

No doubt he will have testimony to give which will be of the greatest
assistance the duke said most encouragingly Perhaps he will be a
sort of rock

II dont in the least know what he will be sighed Miss Alicia
evidently uncertain in her views

But when the father and daughter were announced she felt that his Grace
was really enchanting in the happy facility of his manner He at least
adjusted himself with agility Hutchinson was of course lumbering
Lacking the support of T Tembaroms presence and incongruity he
himself was the incongruous feature He would have been obliged to
bluster by way of sustaining himself even if he had only found himself
being presented to Miss Alicia but when it was revealed to him that he
was also confronted with the greatest personage of the neighborhood he
became as hot and red as he had become during certain fateful business
interviews More so indeed

Th other chaps hadnt been dukes and to Hutchinson the old order had
not yet so changed that a duke was not an awkwardly impressive person to
face unexpectedly

The dukes manner of shaking hands with him however was even touched
with an amiable suggestion of appreciation of the value of a man of
genius He had heard of the invention in fact knew some quite technical
things about it He realized its importance He had congratulations for
the inventor and the world of inventions so greatly benefited

Lancashire must be proud of your success Mr Hutchinson How
agreeably and with what ease he said it

Aye its a success now your Grace Hutchinson answered but I might
have waited a good bit longer if it hadnt been for that lad an his
bold backing of me

Mr Temple Barholm said the duke

Aye Hes got th way of making folks see things that they cant see
even when theyre hitting them in th eyes Id that lost heart I could
never have done it myself

But now it is done smiled his Grace Delightful

Ive got theresame as they say in New YorkIve got there said
Hutchinson

He sat down in response to Miss Alicias invitation His unease was
wonderfully dispelled He felt himself a person of sufficient importance
to address even a duke as man to man

Whats all this romancin talk about th other Temple Barholm comin
back an our lad knowin an hidin him away An Palliser an th
lawyers an th police bein after em both

You have heard the whole story from the duke

Ive heard naught else since I come back

Grandmother knew a great deal before we came home said Little Ann

The duke turned his attention to her with an engaged smile His look
his bow his bearing in the moment of their being presented to each
other had seemed to Miss Alicia the most perfect thing His fine eye
had not obviously wandered while he talked to her father but it had
in fact been taking her in with an inclusiveness not likely to miss
agreeable points of detail

What is her opinion may I ask he said What does she say

Grandmother is very set in her ways your Grace The limpidity of
her blue eye and a flickering dimple added much to the quaint
comprehensiveness of her answer She says the worlds that full of
fools that if they were all killed the Lord would have to begin again
with a new Adam and Eve

She has entire faith in Mr Temple Barholmas you have put forward
his Grace

Mines not faith exactly I know him Little Ann answered her tone as
limpid as her eyes

Theres more than her has faith in him broke forth Hutchinson
Danged if I dont like th way them village chaps are taking it
Theyre ready to fight over it Since theyve found out what its come
to an about th lawyers comin down theyre talkin about gettin up
a kind o demonstration

Delightful ejaculated his Grace again He leaned forward Quite what
I should have expected Theres a good deal of beer drunk I suppose

Plenty o beer but itll do no harm Hutchinson began to chuckle
Theyre talkin o gettin out th fife an drum band an marchin
round th village with a calico banner with Vote for T Tembarom
painted on it to show what they think of him

The duke chuckled also

I wonder how hes managed it he laughed They wouldnt do it for
any of the rest of us you know though Ive no doubt were quite as
deserving I am I know

Hutchinson stopped laughing and turned on Miss Alicia

Whats that young woman comin down here for he inquired

Lady Joan was engaged to Mr James Temple Barholm Miss Alicia
answered

Eh Eh Hutchinson jerked out Thatll turn her into a wildcat Ill
warrant Shell do all th harm she can Im much obliged to you for
lettin us come maam I want to be where I can stand by him

Father said Little Ann what you have got to remember is that you
mustnt fly into a passion You know youve always said it never did any
good and it only sends the blood to your head

You are not nervous Miss Hutchinson the duke suggested

About Mr Temple Barholm I couldnt be your Grace If I was to see
two policemen bringing him in handcuffed I shouldnt be nervous I
should know the handcuffs didnt belong to him and the policemen would
look rightdown silly to me

Miss Alicia fluttered over to fold her in her arms

Do let me kiss you she said Do let me Little Ann

Little Ann had risen at once to meet her embrace She put a hand on her
arm

We dont know anything about this really she said Weve only heard
what people say We havent heard what he says Im going to wait They
were all looking at herthe duke with such marked interest that she
turned toward him as she ended And if I had to wait until I was as old
as grandmother Id waitand nothing would change my mind

And Ive been lying awake at night softly wailed Miss Alicia




CHAPTER XXXIX


It was Mr Hutchinson who having an eye on the window first announced
an arriving carriage

Some of ems comin from the station he remarked Theres no young
woman with em that I can see from here

I thought I heard wheels Miss Alicia went to look out agitatedly
It is the gentlemen Perhaps Lady Joan she turned desperately to the
duke I dont know what to say to Lady Joan I dont know what she will
say to me I dont know what she is coming for Little Ann do keep near
me

It was a pretty thing to see Little Ann stroke her hand and soothe her

Dont be frightened Miss Temple Barholm All youve got to do is to
answer questions she said

But I might say things that would be wrongthings that would harm
him

No you mightnt Miss Temple Barholm Hes not done anything that
could bring harm on him

The Duke of Stone who had seated himself in T Tembaroms favorite
chair which occupied a point of vantage seemed to Mr Palford and
Mr Grimby when they entered the room to wear the aspect of a sort
of presidiary audience The sight of his erect head and clearcut
ivorytinted old face with its alert while wholly unbiased
expression somewhat startled them both They had indeed not expected to
see him and did not know why he had chosen to come His presence
might mean any one of several things and the fact that he enjoyed a
reputation for quite alarming astuteness of a brilliant kind presented
elements of probable embarrassment If he thought that they had allowed
themselves to be led upon a wildgoose chase he would express his
opinions with trying readiness of phrase

His manner of greeting them however expressed no more than a lightly
agreeable detachment from any view whatsoever Captain Palliser felt
this curiously though he could not have said what he would have
expected from him if he had known it would be his whim to appear

How do you do How d you do His Grace shook hands with the amiable
ease which scarcely commits a man even to casual interest after which
he took his seat again

How d do Miss Hutchinson said Palliser How d do Mr Hutchinson
Mr Palford will be glad to find you here

Mr Palford shook hands with correct civility

I am indeed he said It was in your room in New York that I first
saw Mr Temple Temple Barholm

Aye it was responded Hutchinson dryly

I thought Lady Joan was coming Miss Alicia said to Palliser

She will be here presently She came down in our train but not with
us

Whatwhat is she coming for faltered Miss Alicia

Yes put in the duke what by the way is she coming for

I wrote and asked her to come was Pallisers reply I have reason
to believe she may be able to recall something of value to the inquiry
which is being made

Thats interesting said his Grace but with no air of participating
particularly She doesnt like him though does she Wouldnt do to put
her on the jury

He did not wait for any reply but turned to Mr Palford

All this is delightfully portentous Do you know it reminds me of a
scene in one of those numerous plays where the wrong man has murdered
somebodyor hasnt murdered somebodyand the whole company must be
crossexamined because the curtain cannot be brought down until the
right man is unmasked Do let us come into this Mr Palford what we
know seems so inadequate

Mr Palford and Mr Grimby each felt that there lurked in this manner a
possibility that they were being regarded lightly All the objections to
their situation loomed annoyingly large

It is of course an extraordinary story Mr Palford said but if we
are not mistaken in our deductions we may find ourselves involved in a
cause celebre which will set all England talking

I am not mistaken Palliser presented the comment with a short and dry
laugh

Tha seems pretty cocksure Hutchinson thrust in

I am No one knew Jem Temple Barbolm better than I did in the past We
were intimateenemies And he laughed again

Tha says thall swear th chap tha saw through th window was him
said Hutchinson

Id swear it with composure

The duke was reflecting He was again tapping with his cane the gaiter
covering his slender shining boot

If Mr Temple Temple Barholm had remained here his actions would have
seemed less suspicious he suggested

It was Palliser who replied

Or if he hadnt whisked the other man away He lost his head and played
the fool

He didnt lose his head that chap Its screwed on th right wayhis
head is grunted Hutchinson

The curious fellow has a number of friends the duke remarked to
Palford and Grimby in his impartial tone I am hoping you are not
thinking of crossexamining me I have always been convinced that
under crossexamination I could be induced to innocently give evidence
condemnatory to both sides of any case whatever But would you mind
telling me what the exact evidence is so far

Mr Palford had been opening a budget of papers

It is evidence which is cumulative your Grace he said Mr Temple
Temple Barholms position would have been a far less suspicious oneas
you yourself suggestedif he had remained or if he hadnt secretly
removed MrMr Strangeways

The last was Captain Pallisers suggestion I believe smiled the
duke Did he remove him secretly How secretly for instance

At night answered Palliser Miss Temple Barholm herself did not know
when it happened Did you turning to Miss Alicia who at once flushed
and paled

He knew that I was rather nervous where Mr Strangeways was concerned
I am sorry to say he found that out almost at once He even told me
several times that I must not think of himthat I need hear nothing
about him She turned to the duke her air of appeal plainly
representing a feeling that he would understand her confession I
scarcely like to say it but wrong as it was I couldnt help feeling
that it was like having aa lunatic in the house I was afraid he might
be moreillthan Temple realized and that he might some time become
violent I never admitted so much of course but I was

You see she was not told Palliser summed it up succinctly

Evidently the duke admitted I see your point But he seemed to
disengage himself from all sense of admitting implications with entire
calmness as he turned again to Mr Palford and his papers

You were saying that the exact evidence was

Mr Palford referred to a sheet of notes

Thatwhether before or shortly after his arrival here is not at
all certainMr Temple Temple Barholm began strongly to suspect the
identity of the person then known as Strangeways

Palliser again emitted the short and dry laugh and both the duke and
Mr Palford looked at him inquiringly

He had got on to it before he brought him he answered their
glances Be sure of that

Then why did he bring him the duke suggested lightly

Oh well taking his cue from the duke and assuming casual lightness
also he was obliged to come himself and was jolly well convinced
that he had better keep his hand on the man also his eye It was a
goodenough idea He couldnt leave a thing like that wandering about
the States He could play benefactor safely in a house of the size of
this until he was ready for action

The duke gave a moment to considering the matterstill detachedly

It is on the whole not unlikely that something of the sort might
suggest itself to the criminal mind he said And his glance at Mr
Palford intimated that he might resume his statement

We have secured proof that he applied himself to secret investigation
He is known to have employed Scotland Yard to make certain inquiries
concerning the man said to have been killed in the Klondike Having
evidently reached more than suspicion he began to endeavor to persuade
Mr Strangeways to let him take him to London This apparently took some
time The mere suggestion of removal threw the invalid into a state of
painful excitement

Did Pearson tell you that the duke inquired

Captain Palliser himself in passing the door of the room one day
heard certain expressions of terrified pleading was Mr Palfords
explanation

I heard enough Palliser took it up carelessly to make it worth
while to question Pearsonwho must have heard a great deal more
Pearson was ordered to hold his tongue from the first but he will have
to tell the truth when he is asked

The duke did not appear to resent his view

Pearson would be likely to know what went on he remarked Hes an
intelligent little fellow

The fact remains that in spite of his distress and reluctance Mr
Strangeways was removed privately and there our knowledge ends He has
not been seen sinceand a few hours after Captain Palliser expressed
his conviction that the person he had seen through the West Room window
was Mr James Temple Barholm Mr Temple Temple Barholm left the house
taking a midnight train and leaving no clue as to his whereabouts or
intentions

Disappeared said the duke Where has he been looked for

The countenance of both Mr Palford and his party expressed a certain
degree of hesitance

Principally in asylums and socalled sanatoriums Mr Grimby admitted
with a hint of reluctance

Places where the curiosity of outsiders is not encouraged said
Palliser languidly And where if a patient dies in a fit of mania there
are always respectable witnesses to explain that his case was hopeless
from the first

Mr Hutchinson had been breathing hard occasionally as he sat and
listened and now he sprang up uttering a sound dangerously near a
violent snort

Art tha accusin that lad o bein black villain enough to be ready to
do bloody murder he cried out

He was in a very tight place Hutchinson Palliser shrugged his
shoulders as he said it But one makes suggestions at this stagenot
accusations

That Hutchinson had lost his head was apparent to his daughter at least

Thad be in a tight place my fine chap if I had my way he flung
forth irately Id like to get thy head under my arm

The roll of approaching wheels reached Miss Alicia

Theres another carriage was her agitated exclamation Oh dear It
must be Lady Joan

Little Ann left her seat to make her father return to his

Father youd better sit down she said gently pushing him in the
right direction When you cant prove a things a lie its just as
well to keep quiet until you can And she kept quiet herself
though she turned and stood before Palliser and spoke with clear
deliberateness What you pretend to believe is not true Captain
Palliser Its just not true she gave to him

They were facing and looking at each other when Burrill announced Lady
Joan Fayre She entered rather quickly and looked round the room with
a sweeping glance taking them all in She went to the duke first and
they shook hands

I am glad you are here she said

I would not have been out of it my dear young lady he answered
for a farm Thats a quotation

I know she replied giving her hand to Miss Alicia and taking in
Palliser and the solicitors with a bow which was little more than a nod
Then she saw Little Ann and walked over to her to shake hands

I am glad you are here I rather felt you would be was her greeting
I am glad to see you

Whether tha rt glad to see me or not Im glad Im here said
Hutchinson bluntly Ive just been speaking a bit o my mind

Now Father love Little Ann put her hand on his arm

Lady Joan looked him over Her hungry eyes were more hungry than ever
She looked like a creature in a fever and worn by it

I think I am glad you are here too she answered

Palliser sauntered over to her He had approved the dukes air of being
at once detached and inquiring and he did not intend to wear the
aspect of the personage who plays the unpleasant part of the pursuer and
avenger What he said was

It was good of you to come Lady Joan

Did you think I would stay away was her answer But I will tell you
that I dont believe it is true

You think that it is too good to be true

Her hot eyes had records in them it would have been impossible for him
to read or understand She had been so torn she had passed through such
hours since she had been told this wild thing

Pardon my not telling you what I think she said Nothing matters
after all if he is alive

Except that we must find him said Palliser

If he is in the same world with me I shall find him fiercely Then
she turned again to Ann You are the girl T Tembarom loves she put
it to her

Yes my lady

If he was lost and you knew he was on the earth with you dont you
know that you would find him

I should know hed come back to me Little Ann answered her Thats
what her small face looked very fine as in her second of hesitation
a spirited flush ran over it thats what your man will do quite
firmly

It was amazing to see how the bitter face changed as if one word had
brought back a passionate softening memory

My man Her voice mellowed until it was deep and low Did you call T
Tembarom that too Oh I understand you Keep near me while I talk to
these people She made her sit down by her

I know every detail of your letters She addressed Palliser as well
as Palford  Grimby sweeping all details aside What is it you want to
ask me

This is our position your ladyship Mr Palford fumbled a little with
his papers in speaking Mr Temple Temple Barholm and the person known
as Mr Strangeways have been searched for so far without result In the
meantime we realize that the more evidence we obtain that Mr Temple
Temple Barholm identified Strangeways and acted from motive the more
solid the foundation upon which Captain Pallisers conviction rests Up
to this point we have only his statement which he is prepared to make on
oath Fortunately however he on one occasion overheard something said
to you which he believes will be corroborative evidence

What did you overhear she inquired of Palliser

Her tone was not pacific considering that logically she must be on
the side of the investigators But it was her habit as Captain Palliser
remembered to seem to put most people on the defensive He meant to
look as uninvolved as the duke but it was not quite within his power
His manner was sufficiently deliberate

One evening before you left for London I was returning from the
billiardroom and heard you engaged in animated conversation withour
host My attention was arrested first because a sketch of a smile
illconcealed itself you usually scarcely deigned to speak to him and
secondly because I heard Jem Temple Barholms name

And you neither eyes nor manner omitted the word listened

But the slight lift of his shoulders was indifferent enough

I listened deliberately I was convinced that the fellow was a criminal
impostor and I wanted evidence

Ah come now remarked the duke amiably Now we are getting on Did
you gain any

I thought so Merely of the cumulative order of course Palliser
answered with moderation Those were early days He asked you turning
to Lady Joan again if you knew any oneany onewho had any sort of a
photograph of Jem You had one and you showed it to him

She was quite silent for a moment The hour came back to herthe
extraordinary hour when he had stood in his lounging fashion before her
and through some odd uncivilized but absolutely human force of his own
had made her listen to himand had gone on talking in his nasal voice
until with one common crude grotesque phrase he had turned her hideous
world upside downchanged the whole face of itsent the stone wall
rising before her crumbling into dust and seemed somehow to set her
free For the moment he had lifted a load from her the nature of which
she did not think he could understanda load of hatred and silence She
had clutched his hand she had passionately wept on it she could have
kissed it He had told her she could come back and not be afraid As the
strange episode rose before her detail by detail she literally stared
at Palliser

You did didnt you he inquired

Yes she answered

Her mind was in a riot because in the midst of things which must
be true something was false But with the memory of a myriad subtle
duplicities in her brain she had never seen anything which could have
approached a thing like that He had made her feel more human than any
one in the world had ever made her feelbut Jem He had been able to do
it because he was human himselfhuman Im friendly he had said with
his boys laughjust friendly

I saw him start though you did not Palliser continued He stood and
studied the locket intently

She remembered perfectly He had examined it so closely that he had
unconsciously knit his brows

He said something in a rather low voice Palliser took it up I could
not quite catch it all It was something about knowing the face again
I can see you remember Lady Joan Can you repeat the exact words

He did not understand the struggle he saw in her face It would have
been impossible for him to understand it What she felt was that if she
lost hold on her strange belief in the honesty of this one decent
thing she had seen and felt so close to her that it cleared the air
she breathed it would be as if she had fallen into a bottomless abyss
Without knowing why she did it she got up from her chair as if she were
a witness in a court

Yes I can she said Yes I can but I wish to make a statement for
myself Whether Jem Temple Barholm is alive or dead Captain Palliser
T Tembarom has done him no harm

The duke sat up delicately alert He had evidently found her worth
looking at and listening to from the outset

Hear Hear he said pleasantly

What were the exact words suggested Palliser

Miss Alicia who had been weeping on Little Anns shoulderalmost on her
laplifted her head to listen Hutchinson set his jaw and grunted and
Mr Palford cleared his throat mechanically

He said and no one better than herself realized how ominously
cumulative the words sounded that a man would know a face like that
againwherever he saw it

Wherever he saw it ejaculated Mr Grimby

There ensued a moment of entire pause It was inevitable Having reached
this point a taking of breath was necessary Even the duke ceased to
appear entirely detached As Mr Palford turned to his papers again
there was perhaps a slight feeling of awkwardness in the air Miss
Alicia had dropped terror smitten into new tears

The slight awkwardness was on the whole rather added to by T
Tembaromas if serenely introduced by the hand of drama itselfopening
the door and walking into the room He came in with a matteroffact
but rather obstinate air and stopped in their midst looking round at
them as if collectedly taking them all in

Hutchinson sprang to his feet with a kind of roar his big hands
plunging deep into his trousers pockets

Here he is Danged if he isnt he bellowed Now lad tha let em
have it

What he was to let them have did not ensue because his attitude was not
one of assault

Say you are all here aint you he remarked obviously Good
business

Miss Alicia got up from the sofa and came trembling toward him as one
approaches one risen from the dead and he made a big stride toward
her and took her in his arms patting her shoulder in reproachful
consolation

Say you havent done what I told youhave you he soothed Youve
let yourself get rattled

But I knew it wasnt true she sobbed I knew it wasnt

Of course you did but you got rattled all the same And he patted her
again

The duke came forward with a delightfully easy andcould it be almost
jocoseair of bearing himself Palford and Grimby remarked it with
pained dismay He was so unswerving in his readiness as he shook hands

How well done of you he said How well arranged But Im afraid you
didnt arrange it at all It has merely happened Where did you come
from

From America got back yesterday T Tembaroms handshake was a
robust hearty greeting Its all right

From America The united voices of the solicitors exclaimed it

Joseph Hutchinson broke into a huge guffaw and he stamped in
exultation

Im danged if he has na been to America he cried out To America

Oh Miss Alicia gasped hysterically they go backward and forward to
America likelike lightning

Little Ann had not risen at his entrance but sat still with her hands
clasped tightly on her lap Her face had somehow the effect of a flower
gradually breaking into extraordinary bloom Their eyes had once met and
then she remained her soul in hers which were upon him as she drank in
every word he uttered Her time had not yet come

Lady Joan had remained standing by the chair which a few moments before
her manner had seemed to transform into something like a witness stand
in a court of justice Her hungry eyes had grown hungrier each second
and her breath came and went quickly The very face she had looked up at
on her last talk with T Tembaromthe oddly human faceturned on
her as he came to her It was just as it had been that nightjust as
commonly uncommon and believable

Say Lady Joan You didnt believe all that guff did youYou didnt
he said

Nonono I couldnt she cried fiercely

He saw she was shaking with suspense and he pushed her gently into a
chair

Youd better sit down a minute Youre about all in he said

She might have been a woman with an ague as she caught his arm shaking
it because her hands themselves so shook

Is it true was her low cry Is he aliveis he alive

Yes hes alive And as he answered he drew close and so placed
himself before her that he shielded her from the others in the room He
seemed to manage to shut them out so that when she dropped her face
on her arms against the chairback her shuddering silent sobbing
was hidden decently It was not only his body which did it but some
protecting power which was almost physically visible She felt it spread
before her

Yes hes alive he said and hes all rightthough its been a long
time coming by gee

Hes alive They all heard it For a man of Pallisers make to stand
silent in the midst of mysterious slowly accumulating convictions that
some oneperilously of his own rarely inept typewas on the verge
of feeling appallingly like a foolwas momentarily unendurable And
nothing had been explained after all

Is this what you call bluff in New York he demanded Youve got
a lot to explain You admit that Jem Temple Barholm is alive and
realized his asinine error before the words were fully spoken

The realization was the result of the squareshouldered swing with which
T Tembarom turned round and the expression of his eyes as they ran
over him

Admit he said Admit hell Hes upstairs with a slight jerk of
his head in the direction of the ceiling

The duke alone did not gasp He laughed slightly

Weve just got here He came down from London with me and Sir Ormsby
Galloway And he said it not to Palliser but to Palford and Grimby

The Sir Ormsby Galloway It was an ejaculation from Mr Palford
himself

T Tembarom stood square and gave his explanation to the lot of them so
to speak without distinction

Hes the big nerve specialist Ive had him looking after the case from
the firstbefore I began to suspect anything I took orders and orders
were to keep him quiet and not let any fool butt in and excite him
Thats what Ive been giving my mind to The great stunt was to get him
to go and stay at Sir Ormsbys place He stopped a moment and suddenly
flared forth as if he had had about enough of it He almost shouted at
them in exasperation All Im going to tell you is that for about six
months Ive been trying to prove that Jem Temple Barholm was Jem Temple
Barholm and the hardest thing I had to do was to get him so that he
could prove it himself He strode over to the hearth and rang a
bell Its not my place to give orders here now he said but Jem
commissioned me to see this thing through Sir Ormsbyll tell you all
you want to hear

He turned and spoke solely to the duke

This is what happened he said I dare say youll laugh when you hear
it I almost laughed myself What does Jem do when he thinks things
over but get some fool notion in his head about not coming back here
and pushing me out And he lights out and leaves the countryleaves
itto get time to think it over some more

The duke did not laugh He merely smileda smile which had a shade of
curious selfquestioning in it

Romantic and emotionaland quite ridiculous he commented slowly
Hed have awakened to that when he had thought it out some more The
thing couldnt be done

Burrill had presented himself in answer to the bell and awaited orders
His Grace called Tembaroms attention to him and Tembarom included
Palliser with Palford and Grimby when he gave his gesture of
instruction

Take these gentlemen to Sir Ormsby Galloway and then ask Mr Temple
Barholm if hell come downstairs he said

It is possible that Captain Palliser felt himself more irritatingly
infolded in the swathing realization that some one was in a ridiculous
position and it is certain that Mr Palford felt it necessary to
preserve an outwardly flawless dignity as the duke surprisingly left his
chair and joined them

Let me go too he suggested I may be able to assist in throwing
light His including movement in Miss Alicias direction was
delightfully gracious and friendly It was inclusive of Mr Hutchinson
also

Will you come with us Miss Temple Barholm he said And you too Mr
Hutchinson We shall go over it all in its most interesting detail and
you must be eager about it I am myself

His happy and entirely correct idea was that the impending entrance
of Mr James Temple Barholm would come off better in the absence of
audience

Hutchinson almost bounced from his chair in his readiness Miss Alicia
looked at Tembarom

Yes Miss Alicia he answered her inquiring glance You go too
Youll get it all over quicker

Rigid propriety forbade that Mr Palford should express annoyance but
the effort to restrain the expression of it was in his countenance Was
it possible that the American habit of being jocular had actually held
its own in a matter as serious as this And could even the most cynical
and lightminded of ducal personages have been involved in its unworthy
frivolities But no one looked jocularTembaroms jaw was set in its
hard line and the duke taking up the broad ribbon of his rimless
monocle to fix the glass in his eye wore the expression of a man whose
sense of humor was temporarily in abeyance

Are we to understand that your Grace

Yes said his Grace a trifle curtly I have known about it for some
time

But why was nobody told put in Palliser

Why should people be told There was nothing sufficiently definite to
tell It was a waiting game His Grace wasted no words I was
told Mr Temple Barholm did not know England or English methods His
ideaperhaps a mistaken onewas that an English duke ought to be able
to advise him He came to me and made a clean breast of it He goes
straight at things that young fellow Makes what he calls a bee line
Oh Ive been in itI ve been in it I assure you

It was as they crossed the hall that his Grace slightly laughed

It struck me as a sort of wildgoose chase at first He had only a
ghost of a cluea mere resemblance to a portrait But he believed in
it and he had an instinct He laughed again The dullest and most
unmelodramatic neighborhood in England has been taking part in a
melodramabut there has been no villain in itonly a matteroffact
young man working out a queer thing in his own queer matteroffact
way

When the door closed behind them Tembarom went to Lady Joan She had
risen and was standing before the window her back to the room She
looked tall and straight and tensely braced when she turned round but
there was endurance not fierceness in her eyes

Did he leave the country knowing I was herewaiting she asked Her
voice was low and fatigued She had remembered that years had passed
and that it was perhaps after all only human that long anguish should
blot things out and dull a hopeless mans memory

No answered Tembarom sharply He didnt You werent in it then He
believed youd married that Duke of Merthshire fellow This is the way
it was Let me tell it to you quick A letter that had been wandering
round came to him the night before the cavein when they thought he was
killed It told him old Temple Barholm was dead He started out before
daylight and you can bet he was strung up till he was near crazy with
excitement He believed that if he was in England with plenty of money
he could track down that cardsharp lie He believed youd help him
Somewhere while he was traveling he came across an old paper with a lot
of dope about your being engaged

Joan remembered well how her mother had worked to set the story
afloathow they had gone through the most awful of their scenesalmost
raving at each other shut up together in the boudoir in Hill Street

Thats all he remembers except that he thought some one had hit him
a crack on the head Nothing had hit him Hed had too much to stand up
under and something gave way in his brain He doesnt know what happened
after that Hed wake up sometimes just enough to know he was wandering
about trying to get home Its been the limit to try to track him If
hed not come to himself we could never have been quite sure Thats why
I stuck at it But he DID come to himself All of a sudden Sir Ormsby
will tell you thats what nearly always happens They wake up all of a
sudden Its all right its all right I used to promise him it would
bewhen I wasnt sure that I wasnt lying And for the first time he
broke into the friendly grinbut it was more valiant than spontaneous
He wanted her to know that it was all right

Oh she cried oh you

She stopped because the door was opening

Its Jem he said sharply Ann lets go And that instant Little
Ann was near him

No no dont go cried Lady Joan

Jem Temple Barholm came in through the doorway Life and sound and
breath stopped for a second and then the two whirled into each others
arms as if a storm had swept them there

Jem she wailed Oh Jem My man Where have you been

Ive been in hell Joanin hell he answered chokingand this
wonderful fellow has dragged me out of it

But Tembarom would have none of it He could not stand it This sort of
thing filled up his throat and put him at an overwhelming disadvantage
He just laid a hand on Jem Temple Barholms shoulder and gave him an
awkwardly friendly push

Say cut me out of it he said You get busy his voice rather
breaking Youve got a lot to say to her It was up to me beforenow
its up to you

Little Ann went with him into the next room



The room they went into was a smaller one quiet and its oriel windows
much overshadowed by trees By the time they stood together in the
center of it Tembarom had swallowed something twice or thrice and had
recovered himself Even his old smile had come back as he took one of
her hands in each of his and holding them wide apart stood and looked
down at her

God bless you Little Ann he said I just knew I should find you
here Id have bet my last dollar on it

The hands he held were trembling just a little and the dimples quivered
in and out But her eyes were steady and a lovely increasing intensity
glowed in them

You went after him and brought him back He was all wrought up and he
needed some one with good common sense to stop him in time to make him
think straight before he did anything silly she said

I says to him T Tembarom made the matter clear Say youve left
something behind that belongs to you Comeback and get it I meant
Lady Joan And I says Good Lord man youre acting like a fellow in
a play That place doesnt belong to me It belongs to you If it was
mine fair and square Little Willied hang on to it Thered be no
noble sacrifice in his You get a brace on

When they were talking in that silly way about you and saying youd
run away said Little Ann her face uplifted adoringly as she talked
I said to father If hes gone hes gone to get something And hell
be likely to bring it back

He almost dropped her hands and caught her to him then But he saved
himself in time

Now this great change has come he said everything will be
different The men youll know will look like the pictures in the
advertisements at the backs of magazinesthose fellows with chins and
smooth hair I shall look like a chauffeur among them

But she did not blench in the least though she remembered whose words
he was quoting The intense and lovely femininity in her eyes only
increased She came closer to him and so because of his height had to
look up more

You will always make jokesbut I dont care I dont care for anything
but you she said I love your jokes I love everything about you
I love your eyesand your voiceand your laugh I love your very
clothes Her voice quivered as her dimples did These last months Ive
sometimes felt as if I should die of loving you

It was a wonderful thingwonderful His eyeshis whole young being had
kindled as he looked down drinking in every word

Is that the kind of quiet little thing you are he said

Yes it is she answered firmly

And youre satisfiedyou know who it is I wantYoure ready to do
what you said you would that last night at Mrs Bowses

What do you think she said in her clear little voice

He caught her then in a strong hearty young joyous clutch

You come to me Little Ann You come right to me he said




CHAPTER XL


Many an honest penny was turned with the assistance of the romantic
Temple Barholm case by writers of paragraphs for newspapers published
in the United States It was not merely a romance which belonged to
England but was excitingly linked to America by the fact that its
hero regarded himself as an American and had passed through all the
picturesque episodes of a most desirably struggling youth in the very
streets of New York itself and had worked his way up to the proud
position of society reporter on a huge Sunday paper It was generally
considered to redound largely to his credit that refusing in spite
of all temptations to belong to other nations he had been born in
Brooklyn that he had worn ragged clothes and shoes with holes in
them that he had blacked other peoples shoes run errands and
sold newspapers there If he had been a mere English young man one
recounting of his romance would have disposed of him but as he was
presented to the newspaper public every characteristic lent itself to
elaboration He was in fact flaringly anecdotal As a newly elected
President who has made boots or driven a canalboat in his unconsidered
youth endears himself indescribably to both paragraph reader and
paragraph purveyor so did T Tembarom endear himself For weeks he
was a perennial fount What quite credible story cannot be related of
a hungry lad who is wildly flung by chance into immense fortune and the
laps of dukes so to speak The feeblest imagination must be stirred
by the high color of such an episode and stimulated to superb effort
Until the public had become sated with reading anecdotes depicting the
extent of his early privations and dwelling on illustrations which
presented lumberyards in which he had slept and the facades of
tumbledown tenements in which he had first beheld the light of day
he was a modest source of income Any lumberyard or any tenement
sufficiently dilapidated would serve as a model and the fact that in
the shifting architectural life of New York the actual original
scenes of the incidents had been demolished and built upon by
new apartmenthouses or new railroad stations or new factories
seventyfive stories high was an unobstructing triviality Accounts
of his manner of conducting himself in European courts to which he had
supposedly been bidden of his immense popularity in glittering circles
of his finely democratic bearing when confronted by emperors surrounded
by their guilty splendors were the joy of remote villages and towns A
thrifty and young minor novelist hastily incorporated him in a serial
and syndicated it upon the spot under the title of Living or Dead
Among its especial public it was a success of such a nature as betrayed
its author into as hastily writing a second romance which not being
rendered stimulating by a foundation of fact failed to repeat his
triumph

T Tembarom reading in the library at Temple Barholm the first
newspapers sent from New York smiled widely

You see theyve got to say something Jem he explained Its too big
a scoop to be passed over Somethings got to be turned in And it means
money to the fellows too Its good copy

Suppose suggested Jem watching him with interest you were to write
the facts yourself and pass them on to some decent chap whod be glad to
get them

Glad Tembarom flushed with delight Any chap would beway up in the
air at the chance Its the best kind of stuff Wouldnt you mind Are
you sure you wouldnt He was the warhorse snuffing battle from afar

Jem Temple Barholm laughed outright at the gleam in his eyes

No I shouldnt care a hang dear fellow And the fact that I objected
would not stop the story

No it wouldnt by gee Say Ill get Ann to help me and well send
it to the man who took my place on the Earth Itll mean board and boots
to him for a month if he works it right And itll be doing a good turn
to Galton too I shall be glad to see old Galton when I go back

You are quite sure you want to go back inquired Jem A certain glow
of feeling was always in his eyes when he turned them on T Tembarom

Go back I should smile Of course I shall go back Ive got to
get busy for Hutchinson and Ive got to get busy for myself I guess
therell be work to do thatll take me half over the world but Im
going back first Anns going with me

But there was no reference to a return to New York when the Sunday
Earth and other widely circulated weekly sheets gave prominence to the
marriage of Mr Temple Temple Barholm and Miss Hutchinson only child
and heiress of Mr Joseph Hutchinson the celebrated inventor From a
newspaper point of view the wedding had been rather unfairly quiet
and it was necessary to fill space with a revival of the renowned story
with pictures of bride and bridegroom and of Temple Barholm surrounded
by ancestral oaks A thriving business would have been done by the
reporters if an ocean greyhound had landed the pair at the dock some
morning and snapshots could have been taken as they crossed the
gangway and wearing apparel described But hope of such fortune was
swept away by the closing paragraph which stated that Mr and Mrs
Temple Barholm would spend the next two months in motoring through
Italy and Spain in their 90 hp Panhard

It was T Tembarom who sent this last item privately to Galton

Its not true his letter added but what Im going to do is nobodys
business but mine and my wifes and this will suit people just as
well And then he confided to Galton the thing which was the truth

The St Francesca apartmenthouse was a very new one situated on a
corner of an as yet sparsely built but rapidly spreading avenue above
the 100th Streetsmany numbers above them There was a frankly
unfinished air about the neighborhood but here and there a store
had broken forth and valiantly displayed necessities and even articles
verging upon the economically ornamental It was plainly imperative
that the idea should be suggested that there were on the spot sources
of supply not requiring the immediate employment of the services of
the elevated railroad in the achievement of purchase and also that
enterprise rightly encouraged might develop into being equal to all
demands Here and there an exceedingly fresh and clean market store
brilliant with the highly colored labels adorning tinned soups and meats
and edibles in glass jars alluringly presented itself to the passerby
The elevated railroad perched upon iron supports and with iron
stairways so tall that they looked almost perilous was a prominent
feature of the landscape There were stretches of waste ground and high
backgrounds of bits of country and woodland to be seen The rush of New
York traffic had not yet reached the streets and the avenue was of
an agreeable suburban cleanliness and calm People who lived in upper
stories could pride themselves on having views of the river These
they laid stress upon when it was hinted that they lived a long way
uptown

The St Francesca was built of lightbrown stone and decorated with
much ornate molding It was fourteen stories high and was supplied with
ornamental fireescapes It was no slouch of a building Everything
decorative which could be done for it had been done The entrance was
almost imposing and a generous lavishness in the way of cement mosaic
flooring and new and thick red carpet struck the eye at once The
grillwork of the elevator was of fresh bright blackness picked out
with gold and the colored elevatorboy wore a blue livery with brass
buttons Persons of limited means who were willing to discard the
excitements of downtown got a good deal for their money and
frequently found themselves secretly surprised and uplifted by the
atmosphere of luxury which greeted them when they entered their
redcarpeted hall It was wonderful they said congratulating one
another privately how much comfort and style you got in a New York
apartmenthouse after you passed the 150ths

On a certain afternoon T Tembarom with his hat on the back of his head
and his arms full of parcels having leaped off the L when it stopped
at the nearest station darted up and down the iron stairways until
he reached the ground and then hurried across the avenue to the St
Francesca He made long strides and two or three times grinned as if
thinking of something highly amusing and once or twice he began to
whistle and checked himself He looked approvingly at the tall building
and its solidly balustraded entrancesteps as he approached it and when
he entered the redcarpeted hall he gave greeting to a small mulatto boy
in livery

Hello Tom Hows everything he inquired hilariously You taking
good care of this building Let any more eightroom apartments Youve
got to keep right on the job you know Cant have you loafing because
youve got those brass buttons

The small page showed his teeth in gleeful appreciation of their
friendly intimacy

Yassir Thats so he answered Mis Barom shes waitin for you
Them carpets is come sir Tracys wagon brought em bout an hour ago
I told her Id help her lay em if she wanted me to but she said you
was comin with the hammer an tacks Twarnt that she thought I was
too little It was jest that there wasnt no tacks I tol her jest call
me in any time to do anythin she want done an she said she would

Shell do it said T Tembarom You just keep on tap Im just
counting on you and Light here taking in the elevatorboy as he
stepped into the elevator to look after her when Im out

The elevatorboy grinned also and the elevator shot up the shaft the
numbers of the floors passing almost too rapidly to be distinguished
The elevator was new and so was the boy and it was the pride of his
soul to land each passenger at his own particular floor as if he had
been propelled upward from a catapult But he did not go too rapidly for
this passenger at least though a paper parcel or so was dropped in the
transit and had to be picked up when he stopped at floor fourteen

The red carpets were on the corridor there also and fresh paint and
paper were on the walls A few yards from the elevator he stopped at a
door and opened it with a latchkey beaming with inordinate delight

The door opened into a narrow corridor leading into a small apartment
the furniture of which was not yet set in order A roll of carpet and
some mats stood in a corner chairs and tables with burlaps round their
legs waited here and there a cot with a mattress on it evidently to be
transformed into a couch held packages of bafflingly irregular shapes
and sizes In the tiny kitchen new pots and pans and kettles some still
wrapped in paper tilted themselves at various angles on the gleaming
new range or on the closed lids of the dollsized stationary washtubs

Little Ann had been very busy and some of the things were unpacked She
had been sweeping and mopping floors and polishing up remote corners
and she had on a big white pinaforeapron with long sleeves which
transformed her into a sort of small female chorister She came into the
narrow corridor with a broom in her hand her periwinkleblue gaze as
thrilled as an excited childs when it attacks the arrangement of its
first dolls house Her hair was a little ruffled where it showed below
the white kerchief she had tied over her head The warm daisy pinkness
of her cheeks was amazing

Hello called out Tembarom at sight of her Are you there yet I
dont believe it

Yes Im here she answered dimpling at him

Not you he said You couldnt be Youve melted away Lets see
And he slid his parcels down on the cot and lifted her up in the air as
if she had been a baby How can I tell anyhow he laughed out You
dont weigh anything and when a fellow squeezes you hes got to look
out what hes doing

He did not seem to look out particularly when he caught her to him in
a hug into which she appeared charmingly to melt She made herself part
of it with soft arms which went at once round his neck and held him

Say he broke forth when he set her down Do you think Im not glad
to get back

No I dont Tem she answered I know how glad you are by the way
Im glad myself

You know just everything he ejaculated looking her over just every
darned thingGod bless you But dont you melt away will you Thats
what Im afraid of Ill do any old thing on earth if youll just stay

That was his great jokethough she knew it was not so great a joke as
it seemedthat he would not believe that she was real and believed
that she might disappear at any moment They had been married three
weeks and she still knew when she saw him pause to look at her that he
would suddenly seize and hold her fast trying to laugh sometimes not
with entire success

Do you know how long it was Do you know how far away that big place
was from everything in the world he had said once And me holding on
and gritting my teeth And not a soul to open my mouth to The old duke
was the only one who understood anyhow Hed been there

Ill stay she answered now standing before him as he sat down on the
end of the couch She put a firm warmpalmed little hand on each side
of his face and held it between them as she looked deep into his eyes
You look at me Temand see

I believe it now he said but I shant in fifteen minutes

Were both rightdown silly she said her soft cosy laugh breaking
out Look round this room and see what weve got to do Lets begin
this minute Did you get the groceries

He sprang up and began to go over his packages triumphantly

Tea coffee sugar pepper salt beefsteak he called out

We cant have beefsteak often she said soberly if were going to
do it on fifteen a week

Good Lord no he gave back to her hilariously But this is a Fifth
Avenue feed

Lets take them into the kitchen and put them into the cupboard
and untie the pots and pans She was suddenly quite absorbed and
businesslike We must make the room tidy and tack down the carpet and
then cook the dinner

He followed her and obeyed her like an enraptured boy The wonder of her
was that despite its unarranged air the tiny place was already cleared
and set for action She had done it all before she had swept out the
undiscovered corners Everything was near the spot to which it belonged
There was nothing to move or drag out of the way

I got it all ready to put straight she said but I wanted you to
finish it with me It wouldnt have seemed right if Id done it without
you It wouldnt have been as much OURS

Then came active service She was like a small general commanding an
army of one They put things on shelves they hung things on hooks
they found places in which things belonged they set chairs and tables
straight and then after dusting and polishing them set them at a more
imposing angle they unrolled the little green carpet and tacked down
its corners and transformed the cot into a couch by covering it
with what Tracys knew as a throw and adorning one end of it with
cottonstuffed cushions They hung little photogravures on the walls and
strung up some curtains before the goodsized window which looked down
from an enormous height at the top of fourstoried houses and took
in beyond them the river and the shore beyond Because there was no
fireplace Tembarom knocked up a shelf and covering it with a scarf
from Tracys set up some inoffensive ornaments on it and flanked them
with photographs of Jem Temple Barholm Lady Joan in court dress Miss
Alicia in her prettiest cap and the great house with its huge terrace
and the griffins

Aint she a looker Tembarom said of Lady Joan And aint Jem a
looker too Gee theyre a pair Jem thinks this honeymoon stunt of
ours is the best thing he ever heard ofus fixing ourselves up here
just like we would have done if nothing had ever happened and wed
HAD to do it on fifteen per Say throwing an arm about her are you
getting as much fun out of it as if we HAD to as if I might lose my job
any minute and we might get fired out of here because we couldnt pay
the rent I believe youd rather like to think I might ring you into
some sort of trouble so that you could help me to get you out of it

Thats nonsense she answered with a sweet untruthful little face I
shouldnt be very sensible if I wasnt glad you COULDNT lose your job
Father and I are your job now

He laughed aloud This was the innocent fantastic truth of it They had
chosen to do this thingto spend their honeymoon in this particular
way and there was no reason why they should not The little dream which
had been of such unattainable proportions in the days of Mrs Bowses
boardinghouse could be realized to its fullest No one in the
St Francesca apartments knew that the young honeymooners in the
fiveroomed apartment were other than Mr and Mrs T Barholm as
recorded on the tablet of names in the entrance Hutchinson knew and
Miss Alicia knew and Jem Temple Barholm and Lady Joan The Duke of
Stone knew and thought the oldfashionedness of the idea quite the last
touch of modernity

Did you see any one who knew you when you were out Little Ann asked

No and if I had they wouldnt have believed theyd seen me because
the papers told them that Mr and Mrs Temple Barholm are spending their
honeymoon motoring through Spain in their ninetyhorsepower Panhard

Lets go and get dinner said Little Ann

They went into the dollshouse kitchen and cooked the dinner Little
Ann broiled steak and fried potato chips and T Tembarom produced a
wonderful custard pie he had bought at a confectioners He set the
table and put a bunch of yellow daisies in the middle of it

We couldnt do it every day on fifteen per week he said If we
wanted flowers we should have to grow them in old tomatocans

Little Ann took off her choristersgown apron and her kerchief and
patted and touched up her hair She was pink to her ears and had
several new dimples and when she sat down opposite him as she had sat
that first night at Mrs Bowses boardinghouse supper Tembarom stared
at her and caught his breath

You ARE there he said aint you

Yes I am she answered

When they had cleared the table and washed the dishes and had left
the toy kitchen spick and span the ten million lights in New York were
lighted and casting their glow above the city Tembarom sat down on the
Adams chair before the window and took Little Ann on his knee She was
of the build which settles comfortably and with ease into soft curves
whose nearness is a caress Looked down at from the fourteenth story of
the St Francesca apartments the lights strung themselves along lines
of streets crossing and recrossing one another they glowed and blazed
against masses of buildings and they hung at enormous heights in
midair here and there apparently without any support Everywhere was
the glow and dazzle of their brilliancy of light with the distant bee
hum of a nearing elevated train at intervals gradually deepening into a
roar The river looked miles below them and craft with sparks or blaze
of light went slowly or swiftly to and fro

Its like a dream said Little Ann after a long silence And we are
up here like birds in a nest

He gave her a closer grip

Miss Alicia once said that when I was almost down and out he said
It gave me a jolt She said a place like this would be like a nest
Wherever we goand well have to go to lots of places and live in lots
of different wayswell keep this place and some time well bring her
here and let her try it Ive just got to show her New York

Yes let us keep it said Little Ann drowsily just for a nest

There was another silence and the lights on the river far below still
twinkled or blazed as they drifted to and fro

You are there aint you said Tembarom in a halfwhisper

YesI am murmured Little Ann

But she had had a busy day and when he looked down at her she hung
softly against his shoulder fast asleep
