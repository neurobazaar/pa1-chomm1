 Thesaurus1911 
 Version 102 supplemented July 18 1991 


 An electronic thesaurus derived from the version of Rogets Thesaurus
published in 1911

 This thesaurus has been prepared by MICRA Inc May 1991



 MICRA Inc makes no representation that the original 1911 printed
work on which this is based is now in the public domain in any particular
country However MICRA Inc makes no proprietary claims regarding this
electronic version of the 1911 thesaurus If the 1911 work is currently
public domain this electronic version can also be treated as public
domain

 If any commercial use is made of this work prior to January 1 1993
it is suggested that an appropriate donation be made to MICRA Inc to
assist in preparing other such texts which may be useful



 Note that this version of Thesaurus1911 has been supplemented with
over 1000 words not present in the original 1911 edition but many modern
words are still missing About 1500 verbs out of 6500 which can be found
in an 80000word spellchecker are absent from this work The deficiency
of nouns is probably much worse especially on technical topics Of 40000
unique words contained in the original text 12000 are not recognized by a
spellchecker Most of these are foreign words primarily Latin and many
are obsolete In this version these words are marked as such by comments
in square brackets Although this version has been proofread there are
doubtless numerous residual transcription errors some of which may be
obvious even without reference to the original text We will be grateful
if any of these are brought to our attention the corrections will appear
in subsequent versions

 The original arrangement has also been modified slightly in several
places in particular by splitting one entry into two A version of the
1911 thesaurus which is almost identical to the original only a small
number of additions to the original work has also been prepared by MICRA
Inc and also carries no restrictions from MICRA Copies of that version
or this one may be purchased for 4000 from MICRA Inc or from the
Austin Code Works Austin Texas

 In this file comments which are not a proper part of the thesaurus
itself are contained within arrow brackets thus  comment 

 Section headings which are not an actual part of the thesaurus
proper are included between percent  markers

 Occasional references to numbers starting with  are the embryonic
beginnings of a reorganized version mentioned below A few comments are
also included within curly brackets 

 Last edit 122091

 

 The following additional differences will be noted between this version
and the original edition of the printed 1911 thesaurus

 1 the spacesaving abbreviations in the original using hyphens to
 represent common words prefixes or suffixes have been expanded
 into the full words or phrases

 2 the sidebyside format for words and their opposites has been
 abandoned Words are listed in order of their entry number

 3 each main entry 1035 entries has a pound sign  in front of
 the number to facilitate computerized search

 4 Greek words and phrases are transliterated and included between
 brackets in the format grgreek wordgr

 5 where italics occurred in the original italics are used in the
 Microsoft Word format file In the plain ASCII file this
 formatting is lost

 6 in the original book words which were obsolete in 1911 were
 marked with a dagger In this version those words are marked with a
 vertical bar 

 Some of the words which were still current in 1911 but are no longer
 found in a current collegesize dictionary presently obsolete words
 or which are no longer used in the specific indicated sense have been
 marked with a bar followed by an exclamation point  However
 this marking process has just commenced and only a small portion of
 the words which are now obsolete have been thus marked Most though
 not all of the foreignlanguage phrases are now obsolete
 The obsolete notation obs3 indicates that the previous word or
 some word in the previous phrase is not recognized by the word
 processors spelling checker and also is either NOT in a modern
 collegesized dictionary or is noted there as being ARCHAIC

 7 the approximate location of the bottom of each page in the original
 1911 printed book is indicated by a comment of the form
  p 23  To search for a page note that there are two spaces
 between the p and the page number

 8 This file contains only the main body of the thesaurus Neither
 outline nor index are contained here The outline with an overview
 of the organization of the concepts is contained in a separate file
 outlinedoc on the distribution disk

 This first edition of this supplemented 1911 thesaurus June 1991 is
very much less complete than the latest editions of commercial thesauri
and is probably not suitable for use as an adjunct to wordprocessing
programs but it has no proprietary claims attached to it by MICRA Inc
and does not contain any material published commercially after 1911

 Future copyrighted versions of this thesaurus are planned which
will be reorganized in a hierarchical fashion to maximize the ability to
take advantage of inheritance of semantic characteristics from higher
categories The objective is to create a database of words organized by
semantic categories suitable for use in naturallanguage understanding
programs This is a very smallscale project which will not be
competitive with large academic or commercial efforts such as the CYC
project but is intended to provide a convenient resource for
experimentation in naturallanguage processing for individuals or small
groups Anyone who is currently engaged in or contemplating a similar
thesaurus or dictionary project who would be willing to collaborate on
this project is encouraged to contact us so that unnecessary duplication
of effort can be avoided We would also appreciate being notified of
typos errors or omissions in any version Send inquiries or comments to

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
