ACT I SCENE I
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES

Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS

 ARCHIDAMUS If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the
 like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see
 as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia
 CAMILLO I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to
 pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
 ARCHIDAMUS Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
 justified in our loves for indeed
 CAMILLO Beseech you
 ARCHIDAMUS Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we
 cannot with such magnificence in so rare I know not what to
 say We will give you sleepy drinks that your senses
 unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot
 praise us as little accuse us
 CAMILLO You pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely
 ARCHIDAMUS Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me
 and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
 CAMILLO Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia They were
 traind together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt
 them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now
 Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
 separation of their society their encounters though not
 personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts
 letters loving embassies that they have seemd to be together
 though absent shook hands as over a vast and embracd as it were
 from the ends of opposed winds The heavens continue their loves
 ARCHIDAMUS I think there is not in the world either malice or
 matter to alter it You have an unspeakable comfort of your young
 Prince Mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that
 ever came into my note
 CAMILLO I very well agree with you in the hopes of him It is a
 gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old
 hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
 yet their life to see him a man
 ARCHIDAMUS Would they else be content to die
 CAMILLO Yes if there were no other excuse why they should
 desire to live
 ARCHIDAMUS If the King had no son they would desire to live on
 crutches till he had one
 Exeunt




SCENE II
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES

Enter LEONTES POLIXENES HERMIONE MAMILLIUS CAMILLO and
ATTENDANTS

 POLIXENES Nine changes of the watry star hath been
 The shepherds note since we have left our throne
 Without a burden Time as long again
 Would be filld up my brother with our thanks
 And yet we should for perpetuity
 Go hence in debt And therefore like a cipher
 Yet standing in rich place I multiply
 With one We thank you many thousands moe
 That go before it
 LEONTES Stay your thanks a while
 And pay them when you part
 POLIXENES Sir thats tomorrow
 I am questiond by my fears of what may chance
 Or breed upon our absence that may blow
 No sneaping winds at home to make us say
 This is put forth too truly Besides I have stayd
 To tire your royalty
 LEONTES We are tougher brother
 Than you can put us tot
 POLIXENES No longer stay
 LEONTES One sevnight longer
 POLIXENES Very sooth tomorrow
 LEONTES Well part the time betweens then and in that
 Ill no gainsaying
 POLIXENES Press me not beseech you so
 There is no tongue that moves none none i th world
 So soon as yours could win me So it should now
 Were there necessity in your request although
 Twere needful I denied it My affairs
 Do even drag me homeward which to hinder
 Were in your love a whip to me my stay
 To you a charge and trouble To save both
 Farewell our brother
 LEONTES Tonguetied our Queen Speak you
 HERMIONE I had thought sir to have held my peace until
 You had drawn oaths from him not to stay You sir
 Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure
 All in Bohemias well this satisfaction
 The bygone day proclaimd Say this to him
 Hes beat from his best ward
 LEONTES Well said Hermione
 HERMIONE To tell he longs to see his son were strong
 But let him say so then and let him go
 But let him swear so and he shall not stay
 Well thwack him hence with distaffs
 To POLIXENES Yet of your royal presence Ill
 adventure the borrow of a week When at Bohemia
 You take my lord Ill give him my commission
 To let him there a month behind the gest
 Prefixd fors parting Yet good deed Leontes
 I love thee not a jar o th clock behind
 What lady she her lord Youll stay
 POLIXENES No madam
 HERMIONE Nay but you will
 POLIXENES I may not verily
 HERMIONE Verily
 You put me off with limber vows but I
 Though you would seek t unsphere the stars with oaths
 Should yet say Sir no going Verily
 You shall not go a ladys verily is
 As potent as a lords Will go yet
 Force me to keep you as a prisoner
 Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
 When you depart and save your thanks How say you
 My prisoner or my guest By your dread verily
 One of them you shall be
 POLIXENES Your guest then madam
 To be your prisoner should import offending
 Which is for me less easy to commit
 Than you to punish
 HERMIONE Not your gaoler then
 But your kind hostess Come Ill question you
 Of my lords tricks and yours when you were boys
 You were pretty lordings then
 POLIXENES We were fair Queen
 Two lads that thought there was no more behind
 But such a day tomorrow as today
 And to be boy eternal
 HERMIONE Was not my lord
 The verier wag o th two
 POLIXENES We were as twinnd lambs that did frisk i th sun
 And bleat the one at th other What we changd
 Was innocence for innocence we knew not
 The doctrine of illdoing nor dreamd
 That any did Had we pursud that life
 And our weak spirits neer been higher reard
 With stronger blood we should have answerd heaven
 Boldly Not guilty the imposition cleard
 Hereditary ours
 HERMIONE By this we gather
 You have trippd since
 POLIXENES O my most sacred lady
 Temptations have since then been born to s for
 In those unfledgd days was my wife a girl
 Your precious self had then not crossd the eyes
 Of my young playfellow
 HERMIONE Grace to boot
 Of this make no conclusion lest you say
 Your queen and I are devils Yet go on
 Th offences we have made you do well answer
 If you first sinnd with us and that with us
 You did continue fault and that you slippd not
 With any but with us
 LEONTES Is he won yet
 HERMIONE Hell stay my lord
 LEONTES At my request he would not
 Hermione my dearest thou never spokst
 To better purpose
 HERMIONE Never
 LEONTES Never but once
 HERMIONE What Have I twice said well When wast before
 I prithee tell me crams with praise and makes
 As fat as tame things One good deed dying tongueless
 Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
 Our praises are our wages you may rides
 With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
 With spur we heat an acre But to th goal
 My last good deed was to entreat his stay
 What was my first It has an elder sister
 Or I mistake you O would her name were Grace
 But once before I spoke to th purpose When
 Nay let me havet I long
 LEONTES Why that was when
 Three crabbed months had sourd themselves to death
 Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
 And clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
 I am yours for ever
 HERMIONE Tis Grace indeed
 Why lo you now I have spoke to th purpose twice
 The one for ever earnd a royal husband
 Th other for some while a friend
 Giving her hand to POLIXENES
 LEONTES Aside Too hot too hot
 To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
 I have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
 But not for joy not joy This entertainment
 May a free face put on derive a liberty
 From heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
 And well become the agent T may I grant
 But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
 As now they are and making practisd smiles
 As in a lookingglass and then to sigh as twere
 The mort o th deer O that is entertainment
 My bosom likes not nor my brows Mamillius
 Art thou my boy
 MAMILLIUS Ay my good lord
 LEONTES I fecks
 Why thats my bawcock What hast smutchd thy nose
 They say it is a copy out of mine Come Captain
 We must be neat not neat but cleanly Captain
 And yet the steer the heifer and the calf
 Are all calld neat Still virginalling
 Upon his palm How now you wanton calf
 Art thou my calf
 MAMILLIUS Yes if you will my lord
 LEONTES Thou wantst a rough pash and the shoots that I have
 To be full like me yet they say we are
 Almost as like as eggs Women say so
 That will say anything But were they false
 As oerdyd blacks as wind as waters false
 As dice are to be wishd by one that fixes
 No bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
 To say this boy were like me Come sir page
 Look on me with your welkin eye Sweet villain
 Most dearst my collop Can thy dam mayt be
 Affection thy intention stabs the centre
 Thou dost make possible things not so held
 Communicatst with dreams how can this be
 With whats unreal thou coactive art
 And fellowst nothing Then tis very credent
 Thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
 And that beyond commission and I find it
 And that to the infection of my brains
 And hardning of my brows
 POLIXENES What means Sicilia
 HERMIONE He something seems unsettled
 POLIXENES How my lord
 What cheer How ist with you best brother
 HERMIONE You look
 As if you held a brow of much distraction
 Are you movd my lord
 LEONTES No in good earnest
 How sometimes nature will betray its folly
 Its tenderness and make itself a pastime
 To harder bosoms Looking on the lines
 Of my boys face methoughts I did recoil
 Twentythree years and saw myself unbreechd
 In my green velvet coat my dagger muzzld
 Lest it should bite its master and so prove
 As ornaments oft do too dangerous
 How like methought I then was to this kernel
 This squash this gentleman Mine honest friend
 Will you take eggs for money
 MAMILLIUS No my lord Ill fight
 LEONTES You will Why happy man bes dole My brother
 Are you so fond of your young prince as we
 Do seem to be of ours
 POLIXENES If at home sir
 Hes all my exercise my mirth my matter
 Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
 My parasite my soldier statesman all
 He makes a Julys day short as December
 And with his varying childness cures in me
 Thoughts that would thick my blood
 LEONTES So stands this squire
 Officd with me We two will walk my lord
 And leave you to your graver steps Hermione
 How thou lovst us show in our brothers welcome
 Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap
 Next to thyself and my young rover hes
 Apparent to my heart
 HERMIONE If you would seek us
 We are yours i th garden Shalls attend you there
 LEONTES To your own bents dispose you youll be found
 Be you beneath the sky Aside I am angling now
 Though you perceive me not how I give line
 Go to go to
 How she holds up the neb the bill to him
 And arms her with the boldness of a wife
 To her allowing husband

 Exeunt POLIXENES HERMIONE and ATTENDANTS

 Gone already
 Inchthick kneedeep oer head and ears a forkd one
 Go play boy play thy mother plays and I
 Play too but so disgracd a part whose issue
 Will hiss me to my grave Contempt and clamour
 Will be my knell Go play boy play There have been
 Or I am much deceivd cuckolds ere now
 And many a man there is even at this present
 Now while I speak this holds his wife by th arm
 That little thinks she has been sluicd ins absence
 And his pond fishd by his next neighbour by
 Sir Smile his neighbour Nay theres comfort int
 Whiles other men have gates and those gates opend
 As mine against their will Should all despair
 That hath revolted wives the tenth of mankind
 Would hang themselves Physic fort theres none
 It is a bawdy planet that will strike
 Where tis predominant and tis powrfull think it
 From east west north and south Be it concluded
 No barricado for a belly Knowt
 It will let in and out the enemy
 With bag and baggage Many thousand ons
 Have the disease and feelt not How now boy
 MAMILLIUS I am like you they say
 LEONTES Why thats some comfort
 What Camillo there
 CAMILLO Ay my good lord
 LEONTES Go play Mamillius thourt an honest man
 Exit MAMILLIUS
 Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
 CAMILLO You had much ado to make his anchor hold
 When you cast out it still came home
 LEONTES Didst note it
 CAMILLO He would not stay at your petitions made
 His business more material
 LEONTES Didst perceive it
 Aside Theyre here with me already whispring rounding
 Sicilia is a soforth Tis far gone
 When I shall gust it last How camet Camillo
 That he did stay
 CAMILLO At the good Queens entreaty
 LEONTES At the Queens bet Good should be pertinent
 But so it is it is not Was this taken
 By any understanding pate but thine
 For thy conceit is soaking will draw in
 More than the common blocks Not noted ist
 But of the finer natures by some severals
 Of headpiece extraordinary Lower messes
 Perchance are to this business purblind Say
 CAMILLO Business my lord I think most understand
 Bohemia stays here longer
 LEONTES Ha
 CAMILLO Stays here longer
 LEONTES Ay but why
 CAMILLO To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties
 Of our most gracious mistress
 LEONTES Satisfy
 Th entreaties of your mistress Satisfy
 Let that suffice I have trusted thee Camillo
 With all the nearest things to my heart as well
 My chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
 Hast cleansd my bosom I from thee departed
 Thy penitent reformd but we have been
 Deceivd in thy integrity deceivd
 In that which seems so
 CAMILLO Be it forbid my lord
 LEONTES To bide upont thou art not honest or
 If thou inclinst that way thou art a coward
 Which hoxes honesty behind restraining
 From course requird or else thou must be counted
 A servant grafted in my serious trust
 And therein negligent or else a fool
 That seest a game playd home the rich stake drawn
 And takst it all for jest
 CAMILLO My gracious lord
 I may be negligent foolish and fearful
 In every one of these no man is free
 But that his negligence his folly fear
 Among the infinite doings of the world
 Sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord
 If ever I were wilfullnegligent
 It was my folly if industriously
 I playd the fool it was my negligence
 Not weighing well the end if ever fearful
 To do a thing where I the issue doubted
 Whereof the execution did cry out
 Against the nonperformance twas a fear
 Which oft infects the wisest These my lord
 Are such allowd infirmities that honesty
 Is never free of But beseech your Grace
 Be plainer with me let me know my trespass
 By its own visage if I then deny it
 Tis none of mine
 LEONTES Ha not you seen Camillo
 But thats past doubt you have or your eyeglass
 Is thicker than a cuckolds horn or heard
 For to a vision so apparent rumour
 Cannot be mute or thought for cogitation
 Resides not in that man that does not think
 My wife is slippery If thou wilt confess
 Or else be impudently negative
 To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
 My wifes a hobbyhorse deserves a name
 As rank as any flaxwench that puts to
 Before her trothplight Sayt and justifyt
 CAMILLO I would not be a standerby to hear
 My sovereign mistress clouded so without
 My present vengeance taken Shrew my heart
 You never spoke what did become you less
 Than this which to reiterate were sin
 As deep as that though true
 LEONTES Is whispering nothing
 Is leaning cheek to cheek Is meeting noses
 Kissing with inside lip Stopping the career
 Of laughter with a sigh a note infallible
 Of breaking honesty Horsing foot on foot
 Skulking in corners Wishing clocks more swift
 Hours minutes noon midnight And all eyes
 Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
 That would unseen be wicked is this nothing
 Why then the world and all thats int is nothing
 The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing
 My wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
 If this be nothing
 CAMILLO Good my lord be curd
 Of this diseasd opinion and betimes
 For tis most dangerous
 LEONTES Say it be tis true
 CAMILLO No no my lord
 LEONTES It is you lie you lie
 I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee
 Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
 Or else a hovering temporizer that
 Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
 Inclining to them both Were my wifes liver
 Infected as her life she would not live
 The running of one glass
 CAMILLO Who does infect her
 LEONTES Why he that wears her like her medal hanging
 About his neck Bohemia who if I
 Had servants true about me that bare eyes
 To see alike mine honour as their profits
 Their own particular thrifts they would do that
 Which should undo more doing Ay and thou
 His cupbearer whom I from meaner form
 Have benchd and reard to worship who mayst see
 Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
 How I am galld mightst bespice a cup
 To give mine enemy a lasting wink
 Which draught to me were cordial
 CAMILLO Sir my lord
 I could do this and that with no rash potion
 But with a lingring dram that should not work
 Maliciously like poison But I cannot
 Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
 So sovereignly being honourable
 I have lovd thee
 LEONTES Make that thy question and go rot
 Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled
 To appoint myself in this vexation sully
 The purity and whiteness of my sheets
 Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
 Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
 Give scandal to the blood o th Prince my son
 Who I do think is mine and love as mine
 Without ripe moving to t Would I do this
 Could man so blench
 CAMILLO I must believe you sir
 I do and will fetch off Bohemia fort
 Provided that when hes removd your Highness
 Will take again your queen as yours at first
 Even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing
 The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
 Known and allied to yours
 LEONTES Thou dost advise me
 Even so as I mine own course have set down
 Ill give no blemish to her honour none
 CAMILLO My lord
 Go then and with a countenance as clear
 As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia
 And with your queen I am his cupbearer
 If from me he have wholesome beverage
 Account me not your servant
 LEONTES This is all
 Dot and thou hast the one half of my heart
 Dot not thou splitst thine own
 CAMILLO Ill dot my lord
 LEONTES I will seem friendly as thou hast advisd me Exit
 CAMILLO O miserable lady But for me
 What case stand I in I must be the poisoner
 Of good Polixenes and my ground to dot
 Is the obedience to a master one
 Who in rebellion with himself will have
 All that are his so too To do this deed
 Promotion follows If I could find example
 Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
 And flourishd after Id not dot but since
 Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
 Let villainy itself forsweart I must
 Forsake the court To dot or no is certain
 To me a breakneck Happy star reign now
 Here comes Bohemia

 Enter POLIXENES

 POLIXENES This is strange Methinks
 My favour here begins to warp Not speak
 Good day Camillo
 CAMILLO Hail most royal sir
 POLIXENES What is the news i th court
 CAMILLO None rare my lord
 POLIXENES The King hath on him such a countenance
 As he had lost some province and a region
 Lovd as he loves himself even now I met him
 With customary compliment when he
 Wafting his eyes to th contrary and falling
 A lip of much contempt speeds from me
 So leaves me to consider what is breeding
 That changes thus his manners
 CAMILLO I dare not know my lord
 POLIXENES How dare not Do not Do you know and dare not
 Be intelligent to me Tis thereabouts
 For to yourself what you do know you must
 And cannot say you dare not Good Camillo
 Your changd complexions are to me a mirror
 Which shows me mine changd too for I must be
 A party in this alteration finding
 Myself thus alterd witht
 CAMILLO There is a sickness
 Which puts some of us in distemper but
 I cannot name the disease and it is caught
 Of you that yet are well
 POLIXENES How caught of me
 Make me not sighted like the basilisk
 I have lookd on thousands who have sped the better
 By my regard but killd none so Camillo
 As you are certainly a gentleman thereto
 Clerklike experiencd which no less adorns
 Our gentry than our parents noble names
 In whose success we are gentle I beseech you
 If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
 Thereof to be informd imprisont not
 In ignorant concealment
 CAMILLO I may not answer
 POLIXENES A sickness caught of me and yet I well
 I must be answerd Dost thou hear Camillo
 I conjure thee by all the parts of man
 Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
 Is not this suit of mine that thou declare
 What incidency thou dost guess of harm
 Is creeping toward me how far off how near
 Which way to be prevented if to be
 If not how best to bear it
 CAMILLO Sir I will tell you
 Since I am chargd in honour and by him
 That I think honourable Therefore mark my counsel
 Which must be evn as swiftly followed as
 I mean to utter it or both yourself and me
 Cry lost and so goodnight
 POLIXENES On good Camillo
 CAMILLO I am appointed him to murder you
 POLIXENES By whom Camillo
 CAMILLO By the King
 POLIXENES For what
 CAMILLO He thinks nay with all confidence he swears
 As he had seen t or been an instrument
 To vice you tot that you have touchd his queen
 Forbiddenly
 POLIXENES O then my best blood turn
 To an infected jelly and my name
 Be yokd with his that did betray the Best
 Turn then my freshest reputation to
 A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
 Where I arrive and my approach be shunnd
 Nay hated too worse than the greatst infection
 That eer was heard or read
 CAMILLO Swear his thought over
 By each particular star in heaven and
 By all their influences you may as well
 Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
 As or by oath remove or counsel shake
 The fabric of his folly whose foundation
 Is pild upon his faith and will continue
 The standing of his body
 POLIXENES How should this grow
 CAMILLO I know not but I am sure tis safer to
 Avoid whats grown than question how tis born
 If therefore you dare trust my honesty
 That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
 Shall bear along impawnd away tonight
 Your followers I will whisper to the business
 And will by twos and threes at several posterns
 Clear them o th city For myself Ill put
 My fortunes to your service which are here
 By this discovery lost Be not uncertain
 For by the honour of my parents I
 Have uttred truth which if you seek to prove
 I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
 Than one condemnd by the Kings own mouth thereon
 His execution sworn
 POLIXENES I do believe thee
 I saw his heart ins face Give me thy hand
 Be pilot to me and thy places shall
 Still neighbour mine My ships are ready and
 My people did expect my hence departure
 Two days ago This jealousy
 Is for a precious creature as shes rare
 Must it be great and as his persons mighty
 Must it be violent and as he does conceive
 He is dishonourd by a man which ever
 Professd to him why his revenges must
 In that be made more bitter Fear oershades me
 Good expedition be my friend and comfort
 The gracious Queen part of this theme but nothing
 Of his illtaen suspicion Come Camillo
 I will respect thee as a father if
 Thou bearst my life off hence Let us avoid
 CAMILLO It is in mine authority to command
 The keys of all the posterns Please your Highness
 To take the urgent hour Come sir away Exeunt

 Enter LEONTES ANTIGONUS LORDS and OTHERS

 LEONTES Was he met there his train Camillo with him
 FIRST LORD Behind the tuft of pines I met them never
 Saw I men scour so on their way I eyd them
 Even to their ships
 LEONTES How blest am I
 In my just censure in my true opinion
 Alack for lesser knowledge How accursd
 In being so blest There may be in the cup
 A spider steepd and one may drink depart
 And yet partake no venom for his knowledge
 Is not infected but if one present
 Th abhorrd ingredient to his eye make known
 How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
 With violent hefts I have drunk and seen the spider
 Camillo was his help in this his pander
 There is a plot against my life my crown
 Alls true that is mistrusted That false villain
 Whom I employd was preemployd by him
 He has discoverd my design and I
 Remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick
 For them to play at will How came the posterns
 So easily open
 FIRST LORD By his great authority
 Which often hath no less prevaild than so
 On your command
 LEONTES I knowt too well
 Give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him
 Though he does bear some signs of me yet you
 Have too much blood in him
 HERMIONE What is this Sport
 LEONTES Bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
 Away with him and let her sport herself
 MAMILLIUS is led out
 With that shes big with for tis Polixenes
 Has made thee swell thus
 HERMIONE But Id say he had not
 And Ill be sworn you would believe my saying
 Howeer you lean to th nayward
 LEONTES You my lords
 Look on her mark her well be but about
 To say She is a goodly lady and
 The justice of your hearts will thereto add
 Tis pity shes not honest honourable
 Praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
 Which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
 The shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
 That calumny doth use O I am out
 That mercy does for calumny will sear
 Virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has
 When you have said shes goodly come between
 Ere you can say shes honest But bet known
 From him that has most cause to grieve it should be
 Shes an adultress
 HERMIONE Should a villain say so
 The most replenishd villain in the world
 He were as much more villain you my lord
 Do but mistake
 LEONTES You have mistook my lady
 Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing
 Which Ill not call a creature of thy place
 Lest barbarism making me the precedent
 Should a like language use to all degrees
 And mannerly distinguishment leave out
 Betwixt the prince and beggar I have said
 Shes an adultress I have said with whom
 More shes a traitor and Camillo is
 A federary with her and one that knows
 What she should shame to know herself
 But with her most vile principal that shes
 A bedswerver even as bad as those
 That vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy
 To this their late escape
 HERMIONE No by my life
 Privy to none of this How will this grieve you
 When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
 You thus have publishd me Gentle my lord
 You scarce can right me throughly then to say
 You did mistake
 LEONTES No if I mistake
 In those foundations which I build upon
 The centre is not big enough to bear
 A schoolboys top Away with her to prison
 He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
 But that he speaks
 HERMIONE Theres some ill planet reigns
 I must be patient till the heavens look
 With an aspect more favourable Good my lords
 I am not prone to weeping as our sex
 Commonly are the want of which vain dew
 Perchance shall dry your pities but I have
 That honourable grief lodgd here which burns
 Worse than tears drown Beseech you all my lords
 With thoughts so qualified as your charities
 Shall best instruct you measure me and so
 The Kings will be performd
 LEONTES To the GUARD Shall I be heard
 HERMIONE Who ist that goes with me Beseech your highness
 My women may be with me for you see
 My plight requires it Do not weep good fools
 There is no cause when you shall know your mistress
 Has deservd prison then abound in tears
 As I come out this action I now go on
 Is for my better grace Adieu my lord
 I never wishd to see you sorry now
 I trust I shall My women come you have leave
 LEONTES Go do our bidding hence
 Exeunt HERMIONE guarded and LADIES
 FIRST LORD Beseech your Highness call the Queen again
 ANTIGONUS Be certain what you do sir lest your justice
 Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
 Yourself your queen your son
 FIRST LORD For her my lord
 I dare my life lay down and will dot sir
 Please you t accept it that the Queen is spotless
 I th eyes of heaven and to you I mean
 In this which you accuse her
 ANTIGONUS If it prove
 Shes otherwise Ill keep my stables where
 I lodge my wife Ill go in couples with her
 Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her
 For every inch of woman in the world
 Ay every dram of womans flesh is false
 If she be
 LEONTES Hold your peaces
 FIRST LORD Good my lord
 ANTIGONUS It is for you we speak not for ourselves
 You are abusd and by some putteron
 That will be damnd fort Would I knew the villain
 I would landdamn him Be she honourflawd
 I have three daughters the eldest is eleven
 The second and the third nine and some five
 If this prove true theyll pay for t By mine honour
 Ill geld em all fourteen they shall not see
 To bring false generations They are coheirs
 And I had rather glib myself than they
 Should not produce fair issue
 LEONTES Cease no more
 You smell this business with a sense as cold
 As is a dead mans nose but I do seet and feelt
 As you feel doing thus and see withal
 The instruments that feel
 ANTIGONUS If it be so
 We need no grave to bury honesty
 Theres not a grain of it the face to sweeten
 Of the whole dungy earth
 LEONTES What Lack I credit
 FIRST LORD I had rather you did lack than I my lord
 Upon this ground and more it would content me
 To have her honour true than your suspicion
 Be blamd fort how you might
 LEONTES Why what need we
 Commune with you of this but rather follow
 Our forceful instigation Our prerogative
 Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
 Imparts this which if you or stupified
 Or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
 Relish a truth like us inform yourselves
 We need no more of your advice The matter
 The loss the gain the ordring ont is all
 Properly ours
 ANTIGONUS And I wish my liege
 You had only in your silent judgment tried it
 Without more overture
 LEONTES How could that be
 Either thou art most ignorant by age
 Or thou wert born a fool Camillos flight
 Added to their familiarity
 Which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture
 That lackd sight only nought for approbation
 But only seeing all other circumstances
 Made up to th deed doth push on this proceeding
 Yet for a greater confirmation
 For in an act of this importance twere
 Most piteous to be wild I have dispatchd in post
 To sacred Delphos to Apollos temple
 Cleomenes and Dion whom you know
 Of stuffd sufficiency Now from the oracle
 They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
 Shall stop or spur me Have I done well
 FIRST LORD Well done my lord
 LEONTES Though I am satisfied and need no more
 Than what I know yet shall the oracle
 Give rest to th minds of others such as he
 Whose ignorant credulity will not
 Come up to th truth So have we thought it good
 From our free person she should be confind
 Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
 Be left her to perform Come follow us
 We are to speak in public for this business
 Will raise us all
 ANTIGONUS Aside To laughter as I take it
 If the good truth were known
 Exeunt

 FIRST SERVANT My lord
 LEONTES How does the boy
 FIRST SERVANT He took good rest tonight
 Tis hopd his sickness is dischargd
 LEONTES To see his nobleness

 He straight declind droopd took it deeply
 Fastend and fixd the shame ont in himself
 Threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
 And downright languishd Leave me solely Go
 See how he fares Exit SERVANT Fie fie no thought of him
 The very thought of my revenges that way
 Recoil upon me in himself too mighty
 And in his parties his alliance Let him be
 Until a time may serve for present vengeance
 Take it on her Camillo and Polixenes
 Laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
 They should not laugh if I could reach them nor
 Shall she within my powr

 Enter PAULINA with a CHILD

 FIRST LORD You must not enter
 PAULINA Nay rather good my lords be second to me
 Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
 Than the Queens life A gracious innocent soul
 More free than he is jealous
 ANTIGONUS Thats enough
 SECOND SERVANT Madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
 None should come at him
 PAULINA Not so hot good sir
 I come to bring him sleep Tis such as you
 That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
 At each his needless heavings such as you
 Nourish the cause of his awaking I
 Do come with words as medicinal as true
 Honest as either to purge him of that humour
 That presses him from sleep
 LEONTES What noise there ho
 PAULINA No noise my lord but needful conference
 About some gossips for your Highness
 LEONTES How
 Away with that audacious lady Antigonus
 I chargd thee that she should not come about me
 I knew she would
 ANTIGONUS I told her so my lord
 On your displeasures peril and on mine
 She should not visit you
 LEONTES What canst not rule her
 PAULINA From all dishonesty he can in this
 Unless he take the course that you have done
 Commit me for committing honour trust it
 He shall not rule me
 ANTIGONUS La you now you hear
 When she will take the rein I let her run
 But shell not stumble
 PAULINA Good my liege I come
 And I beseech you hear me who professes

 Your most obedient counsellor yet that dares
 Less appear so in comforting your evils
 Than such as most seem yours I say I come

 LEONTES Good Queen
 PAULINA Good Queen my lord good Queen I say good Queen
 And would by combat make her good so were I
 A man the worst about you

 Laying down the child
 LEONTES Out
 A mankind witch Hence with her out o door

 In so entitling me and no less honest
 Than you are mad which is enough Ill warrant
 As this world goes to pass for honest

 PAULINA So I would you did then twere past all doubt
 Youd call your children yours
 LEONTES A nest of traitors
 ANTIGONUS I am none by this good light
 PAULINA Nor I nor any
 But one thats here and thats himself for he
 The sacred honour of himself his Queens
 His hopeful sons his babes betrays to slander
 Whose sting is sharper than the swords and will not
 For as the case now stands it is a curse
 He cannot be compelld to t once remove
 The root of his opinion which is rotten
 As ever oak or stone was sound
 LEONTES A callat
 Of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
 And now baits me This brat is none of mine
 It is the issue of Polixenes
 Hence with it and together with the dam
 Commit them to the fire
 PAULINA It is yours
 And might we lay th old proverb to your charge
 So like you tis the worse Behold my lords
 Although the print be little the whole matter
 And copy of the father eye nose lip
 The trick ofs frown his forehead nay the valley
 The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles
 The very mould and frame of hand nail finger
 And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it
 So like to him that got it if thou hast
 The ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
 No yellow int lest she suspect as he does
 Her children not her husbands
 LEONTES A gross hag
 And lozel thou art worthy to be hangd
 That wilt not stay her tongue
 ANTIGONUS Hang all the husbands
 That cannot do that feat youll leave yourself
 Hardly one subject
 LEONTES Once more take her hence
 PAULINA A most unworthy and unnatural lord
 Can do no more
 LEONTES Ill ha thee burnt
 PAULINA I care not
 It is an heretic that makes the fire
 Not she which burns int Ill not call you tyrant
 But this most cruel usage of your Queen
 Not able to produce more accusation
 Than your own weakhingd fancy something savours
 Of tyranny and will ignoble make you
 Yea scandalous to the world
 LEONTES On your allegiance
 Out of the chamber with her Were I a tyrant
 Where were her life She durst not call me so
 If she did know me one Away with her
 PAULINA I pray you do not push me Ill be gone
 Look to your babe my lord tis yours Jove send her
 A better guiding spirit What needs these hands
 You that are thus so tender oer his follies
 Will never do him good not one of you
 So so Farewell we are gone Exit
 LEONTES Thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
 My child Away witht Even thou that hast
 A heart so tender oer it take it hence
 And see it instantly consumd with fire
 Even thou and none but thou Take it up straight
 Within this hour bring me word tis done
 And by good testimony or Ill seize thy life
 With that thou else callst thine If thou refuse
 And wilt encounter with my wrath say so
 The bastard brains with these my proper hands
 Shall I dash out Go take it to the fire
 For thou setst on thy wife
 ANTIGONUS I did not sir
 These lords my noble fellows if they please
 Can clear me int
 LORDS We can My royal liege
 He is not guilty of her coming hither
 LEONTES Youre liars all
 FIRST LORD Beseech your Highness give us better credit
 We have always truly servd you and beseech
 So to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
 As recompense of our dear services
 Past and to come that you do change this purpose
 Which being so horrible so bloody must
 Lead on to some foul issue We all kneel
 LEONTES I am a feather for each wind that blows
 Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
 And call me father Better burn it now
 Than curse it then But be it let it live
 It shall not neither To ANTIGONUS You Sir come you
hither
 You that have been so tenderly officious
 With Lady Margery your midwife there
 To save this bastards life for tis a bastard
 So sure as this beards grey what will you adventure
 To save this brats life
 ANTIGONUS Anything my lord
 That my ability may undergo
 And nobleness impose At least thus much
 Ill pawn the little blood which I have left
 To save the innocent anything possible
 LEONTES It shall be possible Swear by this sword
 Thou wilt perform my bidding
 ANTIGONUS I will my lord
 LEONTES Mark and perform it seest thou For the fail
 Of any point int shall not only be
 Death to thyself but to thy lewdtongud wife
 Whom for this time we pardon We enjoin thee
 As thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
 This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
 To some remote and desert place quite out
 Of our dominions and that there thou leave it
 Without more mercy to it own protection
 And favour of the climate As by strange fortune
 It came to us I do in justice charge thee
 On thy souls peril and thy bodys torture
 That thou commend it strangely to some place
 Where chance may nurse or end it Take it up
 ANTIGONUS I swear to do this though a present death
 Had been more merciful Come on poor babe
 Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
 To be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say
 Casting their savageness aside have done
 Like offices of pity Sir be prosperous
 In more than this deed does require And blessing
 Against this cruelty fight on thy side
 Poor thing condemnd to loss Exit with the child
 LEONTES No Ill not rear

 LEONTES Twentythree days
 They have been absent tis good speed foretells
 The great Apollo suddenly will have
 The truth of this appear Prepare you lords
 Summon a session that we may arraign
 Our most disloyal lady for as she hath
 Been publicly accusd so shall she have
 A just and open trial While she lives
 My heart will be a burden to me Leave me
 And think upon my bidding Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Sicilia On the road to the Capital

Enter CLEOMENES and DION

 CLEOMENES The climates delicate the air most sweet
 Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
 The common praise it bears
 DION I shall report
 For most it caught me the celestial habits
 Methinks I so should term them and the reverence
 Of the grave wearers O the sacrifice
 How ceremonious solemn and unearthly
 It was i th offring
 CLEOMENES But of all the burst
 And the eardeafning voice o th oracle
 Kin to Joves thunder so surprisd my sense
 That I was nothing
 DION If th event o th journey
 Prove as successful to the Queen O bet so
 As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
 The time is worth the use ont
 CLEOMENES Great Apollo
 Turn all to th best These proclamations
 So forcing faults upon Hermione
 I little like
 DION The violent carriage of it
 Will clear or end the business When the oracle
 Thus by Apollos great divine seald up
 Shall the contents discover something rare
 Even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses
 And gracious be the issue Exeunt




SCENE II
Sicilia A court of justice

Enter LEONTES LORDS and OFFICERS

 LEONTES This sessions to our great grief we pronounce
 Even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
 The daughter of a king our wife and one
 Of us too much belovd Let us be cleard
 Of being tyrannous since we so openly
 Proceed in justice which shall have due course
 Even to the guilt or the purgation
 Produce the prisoner
 OFFICER It is his Highness pleasure that the Queen
 Appear in person here in court

 Enter HERMIONE as to her trial PAULINA and LADIES

 Silence
 LEONTES Read the indictment
 OFFICER Reads Hermione Queen to the worthy Leontes King of
 Sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in
 committing adultery with Polixenes King of Bohemia and
 conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
 lord the King thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by
 circumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the
 faith and allegiance of true subject didst counsel and aid them
 for their better safety to fly away by night
 HERMIONE Since what I am to say must be but that
 Which contradicts my accusation and
 The testimony on my part no other
 But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
 To say Not guilty Mine integrity
 Being counted falsehood shall as I express it
 Be so receivd But thus if powrs divine
 Behold our human actions as they do
 I doubt not then but innocence shall make
 False accusation blush and tyranny
 Tremble at patience You my lord best know
 Who least will seem to do so my past life
 Hath been as continent as chaste as true
 As I am now unhappy which is more
 Than history can pattern though devisd
 And playd to take spectators for behold me
 A fellow of the royal bed which owe
 A moiety of the throne a great kings daughter
 The mother to a hopeful prince here standing
 To prate and talk for life and honour fore
 Who please to come and hear For life I prize it
 As I weigh grief which I would spare for honour
 Tis a derivative from me to mine
 And only that I stand for I appeal
 To your own conscience sir before Polixenes
 Came to your court how I was in your grace
 How merited to be so since he came
 With what encounter so uncurrent I
 Have straind t appear thus if one jot beyond
 The bound of honour or in act or will
 That way inclining hardned be the hearts
 Of all that hear me and my nearst of kin
 Cry fie upon my grave
 LEONTES I neer heard yet
 That any of these bolder vices wanted
 Less impudence to gainsay what they did
 Than to perform it first
 HERMIONE Thats true enough
 Though tis a saying sir not due to me
 LEONTES You will not own it
 HERMIONE More than mistress of
 Which comes to me in name of fault I must not
 At all acknowledge For Polixenes
 With whom I am accusd I do confess
 I lovd him as in honour he requird
 With such a kind of love as might become
 A lady like me with a love even such
 So and no other as yourself commanded
 Which not to have done I think had been in me
 Both disobedience and ingratitude
 To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
 Ever since it could speak from an infant freely
 That it was yours Now for conspiracy
 I know not how it tastes though it be dishd
 For me to try how all I know of it
 Is that Camillo was an honest man
 And why he left your court the gods themselves
 Wotting no more than I are ignorant
 LEONTES You knew of his departure as you know
 What you have undertaen to do ins absence
 HERMIONE Sir
 You speak a language that I understand not
 My life stands in the level of your dreams
 Which Ill lay down
 LEONTES Your actions are my dreams
 You had a bastard by Polixenes
 And I but dreamd it As you were past all shame
 Those of your fact are so so past all truth
 Which to deny concerns more than avails for as
 Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
 No father owning it which is indeed
 More criminal in thee than it so thou
 Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
 Look for no less than death
 HERMIONE Sir spare your threats
 The bug which you would fright me with I seek
 To me can life be no commodity
 The crown and comfort of my life your favour
 I do give lost for I do feel it gone
 But know not how it went my second joy
 And first fruits of my body from his presence
 I am barrd like one infectious my third comfort
 Starrd most unluckily is from my breast
 The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth
 Hald out to murder myself on every post
 Proclaimd a strumpet with immodest hatred
 The childbed privilege denied which longs
 To women of all fashion lastly hurried
 Here to this place i th open air before
 I have got strength of limit Now my liege
 Tell me what blessings I have here alive
 That I should fear to die Therefore proceed
 But yet hear this mistake me not no life
 I prize it not a straw but for mine honour
 Which I would free if I shall be condemnd
 Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
 But what your jealousies awake I tell you
 Tis rigour and not law Your honours all
 I do refer me to the oracle
 Apollo be my judge
 FIRST LORD This your request
 Is altogether just Therefore bring forth
 And in Apollos name his oracle
 Exeunt certain OFFICERS
 HERMIONE The Emperor of Russia was my father
 O that he were alive and here beholding
 His daughters trial that he did but see
 The flatness of my misery yet with eyes
 Of pity not revenge

 Reenter OFFICERS with CLEOMENES and DION

 OFFICER You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
 That you Cleomenes and Dion have
 Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought
 This sealdup oracle by the hand deliverd
 Of great Apollos priest and that since then
 You have not dard to break the holy seal
 Nor read the secrets int
 CLEOMENES DION All this we swear
 LEONTES Break up the seals and read
 OFFICER Reads Hermione is chaste Polixenes blameless
 Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent
 babe truly begotten and the King shall live without an heir if
 that which is lost be not found
 LORDS Now blessed be the great Apollo
 HERMIONE Praised
 LEONTES Hast thou read truth
 OFFICER Ay my lord even so
 As it is here set down
 LEONTES There is no truth at all i th oracle
 The sessions shall proceed This is mere falsehood

 Enter a SERVANT

 SERVANT My lord the King the King
 LEONTES What is the business
 SERVANT O sir I shall be hated to report it
 The Prince your son with mere conceit and fear
 Of the Queens speed is gone
 LEONTES How Gone
 SERVANT Is dead
 LEONTES Apollos angry and the heavens themselves
 Do strike at my injustice HERMIONE swoons
 How now there
 PAULINA This news is mortal to the Queen Look down
 And see what death is doing
 LEONTES Take her hence
 Her heart is but oerchargd she will recover
 I have too much believd mine own suspicion
 Beseech you tenderly apply to her
 Some remedies for life
 Exeunt PAULINA and LADIES with HERMIONE
 Apollo pardon
 My great profaneness gainst thine oracle
 Ill reconcile me to Polixenes
 New woo my queen recall the good Camillo
 Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy
 For being transported by my jealousies
 To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose
 Camillo for the minister to poison
 My friend Polixenes which had been done
 But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
 My swift command though I with death and with
 Reward did threaten and encourage him
 Not doing it and being done He most humane
 And filld with honour to my kingly guest
 Unclaspd my practice quit his fortunes here
 Which you knew great and to the certain hazard
 Of all incertainties himself commended
 No richer than his honour How he glisters
 Thorough my rust And how his piety
 Does my deeds make the blacker

 Reenter PAULINA

 PAULINA Woe the while
 O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
 Break too
 FIRST LORD What fit is this good lady
 PAULINA What studied torments tyrant hast for me
 What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
 In leads or oils What old or newer torture
 Must I receive whose every word deserves
 To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny
 Together working with thy jealousies
 Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
 For girls of nine O think what they have done
 And then run mad indeed stark mad for all
 Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
 That thou betraydst Polixenes twas nothing
 That did but show thee of a fool inconstant
 And damnable ingrateful Nor wast much
 Thou wouldst have poisond good Camillos honour
 To have him kill a king poor trespasses
 More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon
 The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
 To be or none or little though a devil
 Would have shed water out of fire ere donet
 Nor ist directly laid to thee the death
 Of the young Prince whose honourable thoughts
 Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
 That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
 Blemishd his gracious dam This is not no
 Laid to thy answer but the last O lords
 When I have said cry Woe the Queen the Queen
 The sweetst dearst creatures dead and vengeance
 Fort not droppd down yet
 FIRST LORD The higher powrs forbid
 PAULINA I say shes dead Ill sweart If word nor oath
 Prevail not go and see If you can bring
 Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
 Heat outwardly or breath within Ill serve you
 As I would do the gods But O thou tyrant
 Do not repent these things for they are heavier
 Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
 To nothing but despair A thousand knees
 Ten thousand years together naked fasting
 Upon a barren mountain and still winter
 In storm perpetual could not move the gods
 To look that way thou wert
 LEONTES Go on go on
 Thou canst not speak too much I have deservd
 All tongues to talk their bittrest
 FIRST LORD Say no more
 Howeer the business goes you have made fault
 I th boldness of your speech
 PAULINA I am sorry fort
 All faults I make when I shall come to know them
 I do repent Alas I have showd too much
 The rashness of a woman He is touchd
 To th noble heart Whats gone and whats past help
 Should be past grief Do not receive affliction
 At my petition I beseech you rather
 Let me be punishd that have minded you
 Of what you should forget Now good my liege
 Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
 The love I bore your queen lo fool again
 Ill speak of her no more nor of your children
 Ill not remember you of my own lord
 Who is lost too Take your patience to you
 And Ill say nothing
 LEONTES Thou didst speak but well
 When most the truth which I receive much better
 Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me
 To the dead bodies of my queen and son
 One grave shall be for both Upon them shall
 The causes of their death appear unto
 Our shame perpetual Once a day Ill visit
 The chapel where they lie and tears shed there
 Shall be my recreation So long as nature
 Will bear up with this exercise so long
 I daily vow to use it Come and lead me
 To these sorrows Exeunt




SCENE III
Bohemia The seacoast

Enter ANTIGONUS with the CHILD and a MARINER

 ANTIGONUS Thou art perfect then our ship hath touchd upon
 The deserts of Bohemia
 MARINER Ay my lord and fear
 We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
 And threaten present blusters In my conscience
 The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
 And frown upon s
 ANTIGONUS Their sacred wills be done Go get aboard
 Look to thy bark Ill not be long before
 I call upon thee
 MARINER Make your best haste and go not
 Too far i th land tis like to be loud weather
 Besides this place is famous for the creatures
 Of prey that keep upont
 ANTIGONUS Go thou away

 MARINER I am glad at heart
 To be so rid o th business Exit
 ANTIGONUS Come poor babe
 I have heard but not believd the spirits o th dead
 May walk again If such thing be thy mother
 Appeard to me last night for neer was dream
 So like a waking To me comes a creature
 Sometimes her head on one side some another
 I never saw a vessel of like sorrow
 So filld and so becoming in pure white robes
 Like very sanctity she did approach
 My cabin where I lay thrice bowd before me
 And gasping to begin some speech her eyes
 Became two spouts the fury spent anon
 Did this break from her Good Antigonus
 Since fate against thy better disposition
 Hath made thy person for the throwerout
 Of my poor babe according to thine oath
 Places remote enough are in Bohemia
 There weep and leave it crying and for the babe
 Is counted lost for ever Perdita
 I prithee callt For this ungentle business
 Put on thee by my lord thou neer shalt see
 Thy wife Paulina more so with shrieks
 She melted into air Affrighted much
 I did in time collect myself and thought
 This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys
 Yet for this once yea superstitiously
 I will be squard by this I do believe
 Hermione hath sufferd death and that
 Apollo would this being indeed the issue
 Of King Polixenes it should here be laid
 Either for life or death upon the earth
 Of its right father Blossom speed thee well
 Laying down the child
 There lie and there thy character there these
 Laying down a bundle
 Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
 And still rest thine The storm begins Poor wretch
 That for thy mothers fault art thus exposd
 To loss and what may follow Weep I cannot
 But my heart bleeds and most accursd am I
 To be by oath enjoind to this Farewell
 The day frowns more and more Thourt like to have
 A lullaby too rough I never saw
 The heavens so dim by day Noise of hunt within A savage clamour
 Well may I get aboard This is the chase
 I am gone for ever Exit pursued by a bear

 Enter an old SHEPHERD

 hogshead And then for the land service to see how the bear tore

 name was Antigonus a nobleman But to make an end of the ship
 to see how the sea flapdragond it but first how the poor

ACT IV SCENE I

Enter TIME the CHORUS

 TIME I that please some try all both joy and terror
 Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
 Now take upon me in the name of Time
 To use my wings Impute it not a crime
 To me or my swift passage that I slide
 Oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried
 Of that wide gap since it is in my powr
 To oerthrow law and in one selfborn hour
 To plant and oerwhelm custom Let me pass
 The same I am ere ancientst order was
 Or what is now receivd I witness to
 The times that brought them in so shall I do
 To th freshest things now reigning and make stale
 The glistering of this present as my tale
 Now seems to it Your patience this allowing
 I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
 As you had slept between Leontes leaving
 Th effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
 That he shuts up himself imagine me
 Gentle spectators that I now may be
 In fair Bohemia and remember well
 I mentiond a son o th Kings which Florizel
 I now name to you and with speed so pace
 To speak of Perdita now grown in grace
 Equal with wondring What of her ensues
 I list not prophesy but let Times news
 Be known when tis brought forth A shepherds daughter
 And what to her adheres which follows after
 Is th argument of Time Of this allow
 If ever you have spent time worse ere now
 If never yet that Time himself doth say
 He wishes earnestly you never may Exit




SCENE II
Bohemia The palace of POLIXENES

Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO

 POLIXENES I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate tis
 a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this
 CAMILLO It is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have
 for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones
 there Besides the penitent King my master hath sent for me
 to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to
 think so which is another spur to my departure
 POLIXENES As thou lovst me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy
 services by leaving me now The need I have of thee thine own
 goodness hath made Better not to have had thee than thus to want
 thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can
 sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or
 take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I
 have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more
 thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the
 heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee
 speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance
 of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my
 brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are
 even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawst thou the
 Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue
 not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have
 approved their virtues
 CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the Prince What his
 happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly
 noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent
 to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared
 POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care
 so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his
 removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is
 seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say
 that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
 neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
 CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of
 most rare note The report of her is extended more than can be
 thought to begin from such a cottage
 POLIXENES Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the
 angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the
 place where we will not appearing what we are have some
 question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not
 uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither Prithee be my
 present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of
 Sicilia
 CAMILLO I willingly obey your command
 POLIXENES My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves
 Exeunt




SCENE III
Bohemia A road near the SHEPHERDS cottage

Enter AUTOLYCUS singing

 When daffodils begin to peer
 With heigh the doxy over the dale
 Why then comes in the sweet o the year
 For the red blood reigns in the winters pale

 The white sheet bleaching on the hedge
 With heigh the sweet birds O how they sing
 Doth set my pugging tooth on edge
 For a quart of ale is a dish for a king

 The lark that tirralirra chants
 With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
 Are summer songs for me and my aunts
 While we lie tumbling in the hay

 I have servd Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile
 but now I am out of service

 But shall I go mourn for that my dear
 The pale moon shines by night
 And when I wander here and there
 I then do most go right

 If tinkers may have leave to live
 And bear the sowskin budget
 Then my account I well may give
 And in the stocks avouch it

 My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen
 My father namd me Autolycus who being I as am litterd under
 Mercury was likewise a snapperup of unconsidered trifles With
 die and drab I purchasd this caparison and my revenue is the
 sillycheat Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway
 beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come I
 sleep out the thought of it A prize a prize

 Enter CLOWN

 CLOWN Let me see every leven wether tods every tod yields pound

 pound of currants rice what will this sister of mine do with
 rice But my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she
 lays it on She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the
 shearers threeman songmen all and very good ones but they
 are most of them means and bases but one Puritan amongst them
 and he sings psalms to hornpipes I must have saffron to colour
 the warden pies mace dates none thats out of my note
 nutmegs seven race or two of ginger but that I may beg four
 pound of prunes and as many of raisins o th sun
 AUTOLYCUS Grovelling on the ground O that ever I was born
 CLOWN I th name of me
 AUTOLYCUS O help me help me Pluck but off these rags and then
 death death
 CLOWN Alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on
 thee rather than have these off
 AUTOLYCUS O sir the loathsomeness of them offend me more than the
 stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions
 CLOWN Alas poor man a million of beating may come to a great matter
 AUTOLYCUS I am robbd sir and beaten my money and apparel taen
 from me and these detestable things put upon me
 CLOWN What by a horseman or a footman
 AUTOLYCUS A footman sweet sir a footman
 CLOWN Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left
 with thee if this be a horsemans coat it hath seen very hot
 service Lend me thy hand Ill help thee Come lend me thy hand
 Helping him up
 AUTOLYCUS O good sir tenderly O
 CLOWN Alas poor soul

 kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom I was
 going I shall there have money or anything I want Offer me no
 money I pray you that kills my heart
 CLOWN What manner of fellow was he that robbd you
 AUTOLYCUS A fellow sir that I have known to go about with
 trollmydames I knew him once a servant of the Prince I cannot
 tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was
 certainly whipt out of the court
 CLOWN His vices you would say theres no virtue whipt out of the
 court They cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no
 more but abide
 AUTOLYCUS Vices I would say sir I know this man well he hath
 been since an apebearer then a processserver a bailiff then
 he compassd a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinkers
 wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having
 flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue
 Some call him Autolycus
 CLOWN Out upon him prig for my life prig He haunts wakes
 fairs and bearbaitings
 AUTOLYCUS Very true sir he sir he thats the rogue that put
 me into this apparel
 CLOWN Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia if you had but
 lookd big and spit at him hed have run
 AUTOLYCUS I must confess to you sir I am no fighter I am false
 of heart that way and that he knew I warrant him
 CLOWN How do you now
 AUTOLYCUS Sweet sir much better than I was I can stand and walk
 I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsmans
 CLOWN Shall I bring thee on the way
 AUTOLYCUS No goodfacd sir no sweet sir
 CLOWN Then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our sheepshearing
 AUTOLYCUS Prosper you sweet sir Exit CLOWN
 Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice Ill be with
 you at your sheepshearing too If I make not this cheat bring
 out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolld
 and my name put in the book of virtue
 Sings
 Jog on jog on the footpath way
 And merrily hent the stilea
 A merry heart goes all the day
 Your sad tires in a milea Exit




SCENE IV
Bohemia The SHEPHERDS cottage

Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA

 FLORIZEL These your unusual weeds to each part of you
 Do give a life no shepherdess but Flora
 Peering in Aprils front This your sheepshearing
 Is as a meeting of the petty gods
 And you the Queen ont
 PERDITA Sir my gracious lord
 To chide at your extremes it not becomes me
 O pardon that I name them Your high self
 The gracious mark o th land you have obscurd
 With a swains wearing and me poor lowly maid
 Most goddesslike prankd up But that our feasts
 In every mess have folly and the feeders
 Digest it with a custom I should blush
 To see you so attird swoon I think
 To show myself a glass
 FLORIZEL I bless the time
 When my good falcon made her flight across
 Thy fathers ground
 PERDITA Now Jove afford you cause
 To me the difference forges dread your greatness
 Hath not been usd to fear Even now I tremble
 To think your father by some accident
 Should pass this way as you did O the Fates
 How would he look to see his work so noble
 Vilely bound up What would he say Or how
 Should I in these my borrowed flaunts behold
 The sternness of his presence
 FLORIZEL Apprehend
 Nothing but jollity The gods themselves
 Humbling their deities to love have taken
 The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter
 Became a bull and bellowd the green Neptune
 A ram and bleated and the firerobd god
 Golden Apollo a poor humble swain
 As I seem now Their transformations
 Were never for a piece of beauty rarer
 Nor in a way so chaste since my desires
 Run not before mine honour nor my lusts
 Burn hotter than my faith
 PERDITA O but sir
 Your resolution cannot hold when tis
 Opposd as it must be by th powr of the King
 One of these two must be necessities
 Which then will speak that you must change this purpose
 Or I my life
 FLORIZEL Thou dearest Perdita
 With these forcd thoughts I prithee darken not
 The mirth o th feast Or Ill be thine my fair
 Or not my fathers for I cannot be
 Mine own nor anything to any if
 I be not thine To this I am most constant
 Though destiny say no Be merry gentle
 Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
 That you behold the while Your guests are coming
 Lift up your countenance as it were the day
 Of celebration of that nuptial which
 We two have sworn shall come
 PERDITA O Lady Fortune
 Stand you auspicious
 FLORIZEL See your guests approach
 Address yourself to entertain them sprightly
 And lets be red with mirth

 Enter SHEPHERD with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised
 CLOWN MOPSA DORCAS with OTHERS

 SHEPHERD Fie daughter When my old wife livd upon
 This day she was both pantler butler cook
 Both dame and servant welcomd all servd all
 Would sing her song and dance her turn now here
 At upper end o th table now i th middle
 On his shoulder and his her face o fire
 With labour and the thing she took to quench it
 She would to each one sip You are retired

 The hostess of the meeting Pray you bid

 For you theres rosemary and rue these keep
 Seeming and savour all the winter long
 Grace and remembrance be to you both
 And welcome to our shearing
 POLIXENES Shepherdess
 A fair one are you well you fit our ages
 With flowrs of winter
 PERDITA Sir the year growing ancient
 Not yet on summers death nor on the birth
 Of trembling winter the fairest flowrs o th season
 Are our carnations and streakd gillyvors
 Which some call natures bastards Of that kind
 Our rustic gardens barren and I care not
 To get slips of them
 POLIXENES Wherefore gentle maiden
 Do you neglect them
 PERDITA For I have heard it said
 There is an art which in their piedness shares
 With great creating nature
 POLIXENES Say there be
 Yet nature is made better by no mean
 But nature makes that mean so over that art
 Which you say adds to nature is an art
 That nature makes You see sweet maid we marry
 A gentler scion to the wildest stock
 And make conceive a bark of baser kind
 By bud of nobler race This is an art
 Which does mend nature change it rather but
 The art itself is nature
 PERDITA So it is
 POLIXENES Then make your garden rich in gillyvors
 And do not call them bastards
 PERDITA Ill not put
 The dibble in earth to set one slip of them
 No more than were I painted I would wish
 This youth should say twere well and only therefore
 Desire to breed by me Heres flowrs for you
 Hot lavender mints savory marjoram
 The marigold that goes to bed wi th sun
 And with him rises weeping these are flowrs
 Of middle summer and I think they are given
 To men of middle age Yare very welcome
 CAMILLO I should leave grazing were I of your flock
 And only live by gazing
 PERDITA Out alas
 Youd be so lean that blasts of January
 Would blow you through and through Now my fairst friend
 I would I had some flowrs o th spring that might
 Become your time of day and yours and yours
 That wear upon your virgin branches yet
 Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina
 From the flowers now that frighted thou letst fall
 From Diss waggon daffodils
 That come before the swallow dares and take
 The winds of March with beauty violets dim
 But sweeter than the lids of Junos eyes
 Or Cythereas breath pale primroses
 That die unmarried ere they can behold
 Bright Phoebus in his strength a malady
 Most incident to maids bold oxlips and
 The crownimperial lilies of all kinds
 The flowrdeluce being one O these I lack
 To make you garlands of and my sweet friend
 To strew him oer and oer
 FLORIZEL What like a corse
 PERDITA No like a bank for love to lie and play on
 Not like a corse or if not to be buried
 But quick and in mine arms Come take your flowrs
 Methinks I play as I have seen them do
 In Whitsun pastorals Sure this robe of mine
 Does change my disposition
 FLORIZEL What you do
 Still betters what is done When you speak sweet
 Id have you do it ever When you sing
 Id have you buy and sell so so give alms
 Pray so and for the ordring your affairs
 To sing them too When you do dance I wish you
 A wave o th sea that you might ever do
 Nothing but that move still still so
 And own no other function Each your doing
 So singular in each particular
 Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds
 That all your acts are queens
 PERDITA O Doricles
 Your praises are too large But that your youth
 And the true blood which peeps fairly throught
 Do plainly give you out an unstaind shepherd
 With wisdom I might fear my Doricles
 You wood me the false way
 FLORIZEL I think you have
 As little skill to fear as I have purpose
 To put you tot But come our dance I pray
 Your hand my Perdita so turtles pair
 That never mean to part
 PERDITA Ill swear for em
 POLIXENES This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
 Ran on the greensward nothing she does or seems
 But smacks of something greater than herself
 Too noble for this place
 CAMILLO He tells her something
 That makes her blood look out Good sooth she is
 The queen of curds and cream
 CLOWN Come on strike up
 DORCAS Mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
 To mend her kissing with
 MOPSA Now in good time
 CLOWN Not a word a word we stand upon our manners
 Come strike up Music

 POLIXENES Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
 Which dances with your daughter
 SHEPHERD They call him Doricles and boasts himself
 To have a worthy feeding but I have it
 Upon his own report and I believe it
 He looks like sooth He says he loves my daughter
 I think so too for never gazd the moon
 Upon the water as hell stand and read
 As twere my daughters eyes and to be plain
 I think there is not half a kiss to choose
 Who loves another best
 POLIXENES She dances featly
 SHEPHERD So she does any thing though I report it
 That should be silent If young Doricles
 Do light upon her she shall bring him that
 Which he not dreams of

 Enter a SERVANT

 SERVANT O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you
 would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe
 could not move you He sings several tunes faster than youll
 tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all mens
 ears grew to his tunes
 CLOWN He could never come better he shall come in I love a
 ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set
 down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably
 SERVANT He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner
 can so fit his customers with gloves He has the prettiest
 lovesongs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with
 such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
 her and where some stretchmouthd rascal would as it were
 mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the
 maid to answer Whoop do me no harm good man puts him off
 slights him with Whoop do me no harm good man
 POLIXENES This is a brave fellow
 CLOWN Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow
 Has he any unbraided wares
 SERVANT He hath ribbons of all the colours i th rainbow points
 more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle though
 they come to him by th gross inkles caddisses cambrics
 lawns Why he sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you
 would think a smock were sheangel he so chants to the
 sleevehand and the work about the square ont
 CLOWN Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
 PERDITA Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words ins tunes
 Exit SERVANT
 CLOWN You have of these pedlars that have more in them than youd
 think sister
 PERDITA Ay good brother or go about to think

 Reenter SERVANT

 SERVANT Master there is three carters three shepherds three
 neatherds three swineherds that have made themselves all men
 of hair they call themselves Saltiers and they have dance which
 the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not
 int but they themselves are o th mind if it be not too rough
 for some that know little but bowling it will please
 plentifully
 SHEPHERD Away Well none ont here has been too much homely
 foolery already I know sir we weary you
 POLIXENES You weary those that refresh us Pray lets see these
 four threes of herdsmen
 SERVANT One three of them by their own report sir hath dancd
 before the King and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve
 foot and a half by th squier
 SHEPHERD Leave your prating since these good men are pleasd let
 them come in but quickly now
 SERVANT Why they stay at door sir Exit

 Here a dance of twelve SATYRS

 POLIXENES To SHEPHERD O father youll know more of that hereafter
 To CAMILLO Is it not too far gone Tis time to part them
 Hes simple and tells much To FLORIZEL How now fair
 shepherd
 Your heart is full of something that does take
 Your mind from feasting Sooth when I was young
 And handed love as you do I was wont
 To load my she with knacks I would have ransackd
 The pedlars silken treasury and have pourd it
 To her acceptance you have let him go
 And nothing marted with him If your lass
 Interpretation should abuse and call this
 Your lack of love or bounty you were straited
 For a reply at least if you make a care
 Of happy holding her
 FLORIZEL Old sir I know
 She prizes not such trifles as these are
 The gifts she looks from me are packd and lockd
 Up in my heart which I have given already
 But not deliverd O hear me breathe my life
 Before this ancient sir whom it should seem
 Hath sometime lovd I take thy hand this hand
 As soft as doves down and as white as it
 Or Ethiopians tooth or the fannd snow thats bolted
 By th northern blasts twice oer
 POLIXENES What follows this
 How prettily the young swain seems to wash
 The hand was fair before I have put you out
 But to your protestation let me hear
 What you profess
 FLORIZEL Do and be witness tot
 POLIXENES And this my neighbour too
 FLORIZEL And he and more
 Than he and men the earth the heavens and all
 That were I crownd the most imperial monarch
 Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth
 That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
 More than was ever mans I would not prize them
 Without her love for her employ them all
 Commend them and condemn them to her service
 Or to their own perdition
 POLIXENES Fairly offerd
 CAMILLO This shows a sound affection
 SHEPHERD But my daughter
 Say you the like to him
 PERDITA I cannot speak
 So well nothing so well no nor mean better
 By th pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
 The purity of his
 SHEPHERD Take hands a bargain
 And friends unknown you shall bear witness tot
 I give my daughter to him and will make
 Her portion equal his
 FLORIZEL O that must be
 I th virtue of your daughter One being dead
 I shall have more than you can dream of yet
 Enough then for your wonder But come on
 Contract us fore these witnesses
 SHEPHERD Come your hand
 And daughter yours
 POLIXENES Soft swain awhile beseech you
 Have you a father
 FLORIZEL I have but what of him
 POLIXENES Knows he of this
 FLORIZEL He neither does nor shall
 POLIXENES Methinks a father
 Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
 That best becomes the table Pray you once more
 Is not your father grown incapable
 Of reasonable affairs Is he not stupid
 With age and altring rheums Can he speak hear
 Know man from man dispute his own estate
 Lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
 But what he did being childish
 FLORIZEL No good sir
 He has his health and ampler strength indeed
 Than most have of his age
 POLIXENES By my white beard
 You offer him if this be so a wrong
 Something unfilial Reason my son
 Should choose himself a wife but as good reason
 The father all whose joy is nothing else
 But fair posterity should hold some counsel
 In such a business
 FLORIZEL I yield all this
 But for some other reasons my grave sir
 Which tis not fit you know I not acquaint
 My father of this business
 POLIXENES Let him knowt
 FLORIZEL He shall not
 POLIXENES Prithee let him
 FLORIZEL No he must not
 SHEPHERD Let him my son he shall not need to grieve
 At knowing of thy choice
 FLORIZEL Come come he must not
 Mark our contract
 POLIXENES Discovering himself Mark your divorce young sir
 Whom son I dare not call thou art too base
 To be acknowledgd thou a sceptres heir
 That thus affects a sheephook Thou old traitor
 I am sorry that by hanging thee I can but
 Shorten thy life one week And thou fresh piece
 Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
 The royal fool thou copst with
 SHEPHERD O my heart
 POLIXENES Ill have thy beauty scratchd with briers and made
 More homely than thy state For thee fond boy
 If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
 That thou no more shalt see this knack as never
 I mean thou shalt well bar thee from succession
 Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
 Farre than Deucalion off Mark thou my words
 Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time
 Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
 From the dead blow of it And you enchantment
 Worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
 That makes himself but for our honour therein
 Unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou
 These rural latches to his entrance open
 Or hoop his body more with thy embraces
 I will devise a death as cruel for thee
 As thou art tender tot Exit
 PERDITA Even here undone
 I was not much afeard for once or twice
 I was about to speak and tell him plainly
 The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
 Hides not his visage from our cottage but
 Looks on alike To FLORIZEL Willt please you sir be gone
 I told you what would come of this Beseech you
 Of your own state take care This dream of mine
 Being now awake Ill queen it no inch farther
 But milk my ewes and weep
 CAMILLO Why how now father
 Speak ere thou diest
 SHEPHERD I cannot speak nor think
 Nor dare to know that which I know To FLORIZEL O sir
 You have undone a man of fourscorethree
 That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
 To die upon the bed my father died
 To lie close by his honest bones but now
 Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
 Where no priest shovels in dust To PERDITA O cursed
wretch
 That knewst this was the Prince and wouldst adventure
 To mingle faith with him Undone undone
 If I might die within this hour I have livd
 To die when I desire Exit
 FLORIZEL Why look you so upon me
 I am but sorry not afeard delayd
 But nothing altred What I was I am
 More straining on for plucking back not following
 My leash unwillingly
 CAMILLO Gracious my lord
 You know your fathers temper At this time
 He will allow no speech which I do guess
 You do not purpose to him and as hardly
 Will he endure your sight as yet I fear
 Then till the fury of his Highness settle
 Come not before him
 FLORIZEL I not purpose it
 I think Camillo
 CAMILLO Even he my lord
 PERDITA How often have I told you twould be thus
 How often said my dignity would last
 But till twere known
 FLORIZEL It cannot fail but by
 The violation of my faith and then
 Let nature crush the sides o th earth together
 And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks
 From my succession wipe me father I
 Am heir to my affection
 CAMILLO Be advisd
 FLORIZEL I am and by my fancy if my reason
 Will thereto be obedient I have reason
 If not my senses better pleasd with madness
 Do bid it welcome
 CAMILLO This is desperate sir
 FLORIZEL So call it but it does fulfil my vow
 I needs must think it honesty Camillo
 Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
 Be thereat gleand for all the sun sees or
 The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
 In unknown fathoms will I break my oath
 To this my fair belovd Therefore I pray you
 As you have ever been my fathers honourd friend
 When he shall miss me as in faith I mean not
 To see him any more cast your good counsels
 Upon his passion Let myself and Fortune
 Tug for the time to come This you may know
 And so deliver I am put to sea
 With her who here I cannot hold on shore
 And most opportune to her need I have
 A vessel rides fast by but not prepard
 For this design What course I mean to hold
 Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
 Concern me the reporting
 CAMILLO O my lord
 I would your spirit were easier for advice
 Or stronger for your need
 FLORIZEL Hark Perdita Takes her aside
 To CAMILLO Ill hear you by and by
 CAMILLO Hes irremovable
 Resolvd for flight Now were I happy if
 His going I could frame to serve my turn
 Save him from danger do him love and honour
 Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
 And that unhappy king my master whom
 I so much thirst to see
 FLORIZEL Now good Camillo
 I am so fraught with curious business that
 I leave out ceremony
 CAMILLO Sir I think
 You have heard of my poor services i th love
 That I have borne your father
 FLORIZEL Very nobly
 Have you deservd It is my fathers music
 To speak your deeds not little of his care
 To have them recompensd as thought on
 CAMILLO Well my lord
 If you may please to think I love the King
 And through him whats nearest to him which is
 Your gracious self embrace but my direction
 If your more ponderous and settled project
 May suffer alteration on mine honour
 Ill point you where you shall have such receiving
 As shall become your Highness where you may
 Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see
 Theres no disjunction to be made but by
 As heavens forfend your ruin marry her
 And with my best endeavours in your absence
 Your discontenting father strive to qualify
 And bring him up to liking
 FLORIZEL How Camillo
 May this almost a miracle be done
 That I may call thee something more than man
 And after that trust to thee
 CAMILLO Have you thought on
 A place whereto youll go
 FLORIZEL Not any yet
 But as th unthoughton accident is guilty
 To what we wildly do so we profess
 Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
 Of every wind that blows
 CAMILLO Then list to me
 This follows if you will not change your purpose
 But undergo this flight make for Sicilia
 And there present yourself and your fair princess
 For so I see she must be fore Leontes
 She shall be habited as it becomes
 The partner of your bed Methinks I see
 Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
 His welcomes forth asks thee there Son forgiveness
 As twere i th fathers person kisses the hands
 Of your fresh princess oer and oer divides him
 Twixt his unkindness and his kindness th one
 He chides to hell and bids the other grow
 Faster than thought or time
 FLORIZEL Worthy Camillo
 What colour for my visitation shall I
 Hold up before him
 CAMILLO Sent by the King your father
 To greet him and to give him comforts Sir
 The manner of your bearing towards him with
 What you as from your father shall deliver
 Things known betwixt us three Ill write you down
 The which shall point you forth at every sitting
 What you must say that he shall not perceive
 But that you have your fathers bosom there
 And speak his very heart
 FLORIZEL I am bound to you
 There is some sap in this
 CAMILLO A course more promising
 Than a wild dedication of yourselves
 To unpathd waters undreamd shores most certain
 To miseries enough no hope to help you
 But as you shake off one to take another
 Nothing so certain as your anchors who
 Do their best office if they can but stay you
 Where youll be loath to be Besides you know
 Prosperitys the very bond of love
 Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
 Affliction alters
 PERDITA One of these is true
 I think affliction may subdue the cheek
 But not take in the mind
 CAMILLO Yea say you so
 There shall not at your fathers house these seven years
 Be born another such
 FLORIZEL My good Camillo
 She is as forward of her breeding as
 She is i th rear o our birth
 CAMILLO I cannot say tis pity
 She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
 To most that teach
 PERDITA Your pardon sir for this
 Ill blush you thanks
 FLORIZEL My prettiest Perdita
 But O the thorns we stand upon Camillo
 Preserver of my father now of me
 The medicine of our house how shall we do
 We are not furnishd like Bohemias son
 Nor shall appear in Sicilia
 CAMILLO My lord
 Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes
 Do all lie there It shall be so my care
 To have you royally appointed as if
 The scene you play were mine For instance sir
 That you may know you shall not want one word
 They talk aside

 Reenter AUTOLYCUS

 AUTOLYCUS Ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his sworn
 brother a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery
 not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch
 tablebook ballad knife tape glove shoetie bracelet
 hornring to keep my pack from fasting They throng who should
 buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a
 benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was
 best in picture and what I saw to my good use I remembred My
 clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in
 love with the wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
 till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the
 herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears You might
 have pinchd a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a
 codpiece of a purse I would have fild keys off that hung in
 chains No hearing no feeling but my sirs song and admiring
 the nothing of it So that in this time of lethargy I pickd and
 cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come
 in with whoobub against his daughter and the Kings son and
 scard my choughs from the chaff I had not left a purse alive in
 the whole army

 CAMILLO FLORIZEL and PERDITA come forward

 CAMILLO Nay but my letters by this means being there
 So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
 FLORIZEL And those that youll procure from King Leontes
 CAMILLO Shall satisfy your father
 PERDITA Happy be you
 All that you speak shows fair
 CAMILLO seeing AUTOLYCUS Who have we here
 Well make an instrument of this omit
 Nothing may give us aid
 AUTOLYCUS Aside If they have overheard me now why hanging
 CAMILLO How now good fellow Why shakst thou so
 Fear not man heres no harm intended to thee
 AUTOLYCUS I am a poor fellow sir
 CAMILLO Why be so still heres nobody will steal that from thee
 Yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange
 therefore discase thee instantly thou must think theres a
 necessity int and change garments with this gentleman Though
 the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee theres
 some boot Giving money
 AUTOLYCUS I am a poor fellow sir Aside I know ye well enough
 CAMILLO Nay prithee dispatch The gentleman is half flayd already
 AUTOLYCUS Are you in earnest sir Aside I smell the trick ont
 FLORIZEL Dispatch I prithee
 AUTOLYCUS Indeed I have had earnest but I cannot with conscience
 take it
 CAMILLO Unbuckle unbuckle

 FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments

 Fortunate mistress let my prophecy
 Come home to ye you must retire yourself
 Into some covert take your sweethearts hat
 And pluck it oer your brows muffle your face
 Dismantle you and as you can disliken
 The truth of your own seeming that you may
 For I do fear eyes over to shipboard
 Get undescried
 PERDITA I see the play so lies
 That I must bear a part
 CAMILLO No remedy
 Have you done there
 FLORIZEL Should I now meet my father
 He would not call me son
 CAMILLO Nay you shall have no hat
 Giving it to PERDITA
 Come lady come Farewell my friend
 AUTOLYCUS Adieu sir
 FLORIZEL O Perdita what have we twain forgot
 Pray you a word They converse apart
 CAMILLO Aside What I do next shall be to tell the King
 Of this escape and whither they are bound
 Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
 To force him after in whose company
 I shall review Sicilia for whose sight
 I have a womans longing
 FLORIZEL Fortune speed us
 Thus we set on Camillo to th seaside
 CAMILLO The swifter speed the better
 Exeunt FLORIZEL PERDITA and CAMILLO
 AUTOLYCUS I understand the business I hear it To have an open
 ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a
 cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for
 th other senses I see this is the time that the unjust man doth
 thrive What an exchange had this been without boot What a boot
 is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive
 at us and we may do anything extempore The Prince himself is
 about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his
 clog at his heels If I thought it were a piece of honesty to
 acquaint the King withal I would not dot I hold it the more
 knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession

 Reenter CLOWN and SHEPHERD

 Aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain Every lanes
 end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work
 CLOWN See see what a man you are now There is no other way but
 to tell the King shes a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
 SHEPHERD Nay but hear me
 CLOWN Nay but hear me
 SHEPHERD Go to then
 CLOWN She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood
 has not offended the King and so your flesh and blood is not to
 be punishd by him Show those things you found about her those
 secret things all but what she has with her This being done
 let the law go whistle I warrant you
 SHEPHERD I will tell the King all every word yea and his sons
 pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his
 father nor to me to go about to make me the Kings brotherinlaw
 CLOWN Indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you could have
 been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know
 how much an ounce
 AUTOLYCUS Aside Very wisely puppies
 SHEPHERD Well let us to the King There is that in this fardel
 will make him scratch his beard
 AUTOLYCUS Aside I know not what impediment this complaint may
 be to the flight of my master
 CLOWN Pray heartily he be at palace
 AUTOLYCUS Aside Though I am not naturally honest I am so
 sometimes by chance Let me pocket up my pedlars excrement
 Takes off his false beard How now rustics Whither are you bound
 SHEPHERD To th palace an it like your worship
 AUTOLYCUS Your affairs there what with whom the condition of
 that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages
 of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be
 known discover
 CLOWN We are but plain fellows sir
 AUTOLYCUS A lie you are rough and hairy Let me have no lying it
 becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the
 lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing
 steel therefore they do not give us the lie
 CLOWN Your worship had like to have given us one if you had not
 taken yourself with the manner
 SHEPHERD Are you a courtier ant like you sir
 AUTOLYCUS Whether it like me or no I am a courtier Seest thou
 not the air of the court in these enfoldings Hath not my gait in
 it the measure of the court Receives not thy nose courtodour
 from me Reflect I not on thy baseness courtcontempt Thinkst
 thou for that I insinuate that toaze from thee thy business I
 am therefore no courtier I am courtier capape and one that
 will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon I
 command the to open thy affair
 SHEPHERD My business sir is to the King
 AUTOLYCUS What advocate hast thou to him
 SHEPHERD I know not ant like you
 CLOWN Advocates the courtword for a pheasant say you have none
 SHEPHERD None sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen
 AUTOLYCUS How blessed are we that are not simple men
 Yet nature might have made me as these are
 Therefore I will not disdain
 CLOWN This cannot be but a great courtier
 SHEPHERD His garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely
 CLOWN He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
 A great man Ill warrant I know by the picking ons teeth
 AUTOLYCUS The fardel there Whats i th fardel Wherefore that box
 SHEPHERD Sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which
 none must know but the King and which he shall know within this
 hour if I may come to th speech of him
 AUTOLYCUS Age thou hast lost thy labour
 SHEPHERD Why Sir
 AUTOLYCUS The King is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new
 ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou best
 capable of things serious thou must know the King is full of grief
 SHEPHERD So tis said sir about his son that should have
 married a shepherds daughter
 AUTOLYCUS If that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly the
 curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the
 back of man the heart of monster
 CLOWN Think you so sir
 AUTOLYCUS Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and
 vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though
 removd fifty times shall all come under the hangman which
 though it be great pity yet it is necessary An old
 sheepwhistling rogue a ramtender to offer to have his
 daughter come into grace Some say he shall be stond but that
 death is too soft for him say I Draw our throne into a
 sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
 CLOWN Has the old man eer a son sir do you hear ant like you sir
 AUTOLYCUS He has a son who shall be flayd alive then nointed
 over with honey set on the head of a wasps nest then stand
 till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recoverd again
 with aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is
 and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set
 against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon
 him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death But
 what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be
 smild at their offences being so capital Tell me for you seem
 to be honest plain men what you have to the King Being
 something gently considerd Ill bring you where he is aboard
 tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs
 and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits here
 is man shall do it
 CLOWN He seems to be of great authority Close with him give him
 gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led
 by the nose with gold Show the inside of your purse to the
 outside of his hand and no more ado Remember stond and
 flayd alive
 SHEPHERD Ant please you sir to undertake the business for us
 here is that gold I have Ill make it as much more and leave
 this young man in pawn till I bring it you
 AUTOLYCUS After I have done what I promised
 SHEPHERD Ay sir
 AUTOLYCUS Well give me the moiety Are you a party in this business
 CLOWN In some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful one I
 hope I shall not be flayd out of it
 AUTOLYCUS O thats the case of the shepherds son Hang him
 hell be made an example
 CLOWN Comfort good comfort We must to the King and show our
 strange sights He must know tis none of your daughter nor my
 sister we are gone else Sir I will give you as much as this
 old man does when the business is performed and remain as he
 says your pawn till it be brought you

 the righthand I will but look upon the hedge and follow you
 CLOWN We are blest in this man as I may say even blest
 SHEPHERD Lets before as he bids us He was provided to do us good
 Exeunt SHEPHERD and CLOWN
 AUTOLYCUS If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not
 suffer me she drops booties in my mouth I am courted now with a
 double occasion gold and a means to do the Prince my master
 good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement I
 will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him If he
 think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they
 have to the King concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for
 being so far officious for I am proof against that title and
 what shame else belongs tot To him will I present them
 There may be matter in it Exit

ACT V SCENE I
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES

Enter LEONTES CLEOMENES DION PAULINA and OTHERS

 CLEOMENES Sir you have done enough and have performd
 A saintlike sorrow No fault could you make
 Which you have not redeemd indeed paid down
 More penitence than done trespass At the last
 Do as the heavens have done forget your evil
 With them forgive yourself
 LEONTES Whilst I remember
 Her and her virtues I cannot forget
 My blemishes in them and so still think of
 The wrong I did myself which was so much
 That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
 Destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man
 Bred his hopes out of
 PAULINA True too true my lord
 If one by one you wedded all the world
 Or from the all that are took something good
 To make a perfect woman she you killd
 Would be unparalleld
 LEONTES I think so Killd
 She I killd I did so but thou strikst me
 Sorely to say I did It is as bitter
 Upon thy tongue as in my thought Now good now
 Say so but seldom
 CLEOMENES Not at all good lady
 You might have spoken a thousand things that would
 Have done the time more benefit and gracd
 Your kindness better
 PAULINA You are one of those
 Would have him wed again
 DION If you would not so
 You pity not the state nor the remembrance
 Of his most sovereign name consider little
 What dangers by his Highness fail of issue
 May drop upon his kingdom and devour
 Incertain lookerson What were more holy
 Than to rejoice the former queen is well
 What holier than for royaltys repair
 For present comfort and for future good
 To bless the bed of majesty again
 With a sweet fellow tot
 PAULINA There is none worthy
 Respecting her thats gone Besides the gods
 Will have fulfilld their secret purposes
 For has not the divine Apollo said
 Ist not the tenour of his oracle
 That King Leontes shall not have an heir
 Till his lost child be found Which that it shall
 Is all as monstrous to our human reason
 As my Antigonus to break his grave
 And come again to me who on my life
 Did perish with the infant Tis your counsel
 My lord should to the heavens be contrary
 Oppose against their wills To LEONTES Care not for issue
 The crown will find an heir Great Alexander
 Left his to th worthiest so his successor
 Was like to be the best
 LEONTES Good Paulina
 Who hast the memory of Hermione
 I know in honour O that ever I
 Had squard me to thy counsel Then even now
 I might have lookd upon my queens full eyes
 Have taken treasure from her lips
 PAULINA And left them
 More rich for what they yielded
 LEONTES Thou speakst truth
 No more such wives therefore no wife One worse
 And better usd would make her sainted spirit
 Again possess her corpse and on this stage
 Where we offend her now appear soulvexd
 And begin Why to me
 PAULINA Had she such power
 She had just cause
 LEONTES She had and would incense me
 To murder her I married
 PAULINA I should so
 Were I the ghost that walkd Id bid you mark
 Her eye and tell me for what dull part int
 You chose her then Id shriek that even your ears
 Should rift to hear me and the words that followd
 Should be Remember mine
 LEONTES Stars stars
 And all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife
 Ill have no wife Paulina
 PAULINA Will you swear
 Never to marry but by my free leave
 LEONTES Never Paulina so be blest my spirit
 PAULINA Then good my lords bear witness to his oath
 CLEOMENES You tempt him overmuch
 PAULINA Unless another
 As like Hermione as is her picture
 Affront his eye
 CLEOMENES Good madam
 PAULINA I have done
 Yet if my lord will marry if you will sir
 No remedy but you will give me the office
 To choose you a queen She shall not be so young
 As was your former but she shall be such
 As walkd your first queens ghost it should take joy
 To see her in your arms
 LEONTES My true Paulina
 We shall not marry till thou bidst us
 PAULINA That
 Shall be when your first queens again in breath
 Never till then

 Enter a GENTLEMAN

 GENTLEMAN One that gives out himself Prince Florizel
 Son of Polixenes with his princess she
 The fairest I have yet beheld desires access
 To your high presence
 LEONTES What with him He comes not
 Like to his fathers greatness His approach
 So out of circumstance and sudden tells us
 Tis not a visitation framd but forcd
 By need and accident What train
 GENTLEMAN But few
 And those but mean
 LEONTES His princess say you with him
 GENTLEMAN Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think
 That eer the sun shone bright on
 PAULINA O Hermione
 As every present time doth boast itself
 Above a better gone so must thy grave
 Give way to whats seen now Sir you yourself
 Have said and writ so but your writing now
 Is colder than that theme She had not been
 Nor was not to be equalld Thus your verse
 Flowd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebbd
 To say you have seen a better
 GENTLEMAN Pardon madam
 The one I have almost forgot your pardon
 The other when she has obtaind your eye
 Will have your tongue too This is a creature
 Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
 Of all professors else make proselytes
 Of who she but bid follow
 PAULINA How not women
 GENTLEMAN Women will love her that she is a woman
 More worth than any man men that she is
 The rarest of all women
 LEONTES Go Cleomenes
 Yourself assisted with your honourd friends
 Bring them to our embracement Exeunt
 Still tis strange
 He thus should steal upon us
 PAULINA Had our prince
 Jewel of children seen this hour he had paird
 Well with this lord there was not full a month
 Between their births
 LEONTES Prithee no more cease Thou knowst
 He dies to me again when talkd of Sure
 When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches
 Will bring me to consider that which may
 Unfurnish me of reason

 Reenter CLEOMENES with FLORIZEL PERDITA and
 ATTENDANTS

 They are come
 Your mother was most true to wedlock Prince
 For she did print your royal father off
 Conceiving you Were I but twentyone
 Your fathers image is so hit in you
 His very air that I should call you brother
 As I did him and speak of something wildly
 By us performd before Most dearly welcome
 And your fair princess goddess O alas
 I lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
 Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
 You gracious couple do And then I lost
 All mine own folly the society
 Amity too of your brave father whom
 Though bearing misery I desire my life
 Once more to look on him
 FLORIZEL By his command
 Have I here touchd Sicilia and from him
 Give you all greetings that a king at friend
 Can send his brother and but infirmity
 Which waits upon worn times hath something seizd
 His wishd ability he had himself
 The lands and waters twixt your throne and his
 Measurd to look upon you whom he loves
 He bade me say so more than all the sceptres
 And those that bear them living
 LEONTES O my brother
 Good gentleman the wrongs I have done thee stir
 Afresh within me and these thy offices
 So rarely kind are as interpreters
 Of my behindhand slackness Welcome hither
 As is the spring to th earth And hath he too
 Exposd this paragon to th fearful usage
 At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune
 To greet a man not worth her pains much less
 Th adventure of her person
 FLORIZEL Good my lord
 She came from Libya
 LEONTES Where the warlike Smalus
 That noble honourd lord is feard and lovd
 FLORIZEL Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
 His tears proclaimd his parting with her thence
 A prosperous southwind friendly we have crossd
 To execute the charge my father gave me
 For visiting your Highness My best train
 I have from your Sicilian shores dismissd
 Who for Bohemia bend to signify
 Not only my success in Libya sir
 But my arrival and my wifes in safety
 Here where we are
 LEONTES The blessed gods
 Purge all infection from our air whilst you
 Do climate here You have a holy father
 A graceful gentleman against whose person
 So sacred as it is I have done sin
 For which the heavens taking angry note
 Have left me issueless and your fathers blest
 As he from heaven merits it with you
 Worthy his goodness What might I have been
 Might I a son and daughter now have lookd on
 Such goodly things as you

 Enter a LORD

 LORD Most noble sir
 That which I shall report will bear no credit
 Were not the proof so nigh Please you great sir
 Bohemia greets you from himself by me
 Desires you to attach his son who has
 His dignity and duty both cast off
 Fled from his father from his hopes and with
 A shepherds daughter
 LEONTES Wheres Bohemia Speak
 LORD Here in your city I now came from him
 I speak amazedly and it becomes
 My marvel and my message To your court
 Whiles he was hastning in the chase it seems
 Of this fair couple meets he on the way
 The father of this seeming lady and
 Her brother having both their country quitted
 With this young prince
 FLORIZEL Camillo has betrayd me
 Whose honour and whose honesty till now
 Endurd all weathers
 LORD Layt so to his charge
 Hes with the King your father
 LEONTES Who Camillo
 LORD Camillo sir I spake with him who now
 Has these poor men in question Never saw I
 Wretches so quake They kneel they kiss the earth
 Forswear themselves as often as they speak
 Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
 With divers deaths in death
 PERDITA O my poor father
 The heaven sets spies upon us will not have
 Our contract celebrated
 LEONTES You are married
 FLORIZEL We are not sir nor are we like to be
 The stars I see will kiss the valleys first
 The odds for high and lows alike
 LEONTES My lord
 Is this the daughter of a king
 FLORIZEL She is
 When once she is my wife
 LEONTES That once I see by your good fathers speed
 Will come on very slowly I am sorry
 Most sorry you have broken from his liking
 Where you were tied in duty and as sorry
 Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
 That you might well enjoy her
 FLORIZEL Dear look up
 Though Fortune visible an enemy
 Should chase us with my father powr no jot
 Hath she to change our loves Beseech you sir
 Remember since you owd no more to time
 Than I do now With thought of such affections
 Step forth mine advocate at your request
 My father will grant precious things as trifles
 LEONTES Would he do so Id beg your precious mistress
 Which he counts but a trifle
 PAULINA Sir my liege
 Your eye hath too much youth int Not a month
 Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
 Than what you look on now
 LEONTES I thought of her
 Even in these looks I made To FLORIZEL But your petition
 Is yet unanswerd I will to your father
 Your honour not oerthrown by your desires
 I am friend to them and you Upon which errand
 I now go toward him therefore follow me
 And mark what way I make Come good my lord Exeunt




SCENE II
Sicilia Before the palace of LEONTES

Enter AUTOLYCUS and a GENTLEMAN

 AUTOLYCUS Beseech you sir were you present at this relation
 FIRST GENTLEMAN I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the
 old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after
 a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber
 only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child
 AUTOLYCUS I would most gladly know the issue of it
 FIRST GENTLEMAN I make a broken delivery of the business but the
 changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of
 admiration They seemd almost with staring on one another to
 tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness
 language in their very gesture they lookd as they had heard of
 a world ransomd or one destroyed A notable passion of wonder
 appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but
 seeing could not say if th importance were joy or sorrowbut in
 the extremity of the one it must needs be

 Enter another GENTLEMAN

 Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more The news Rogero
 SECOND GENTLEMAN Nothing but bonfires The oracle is fulfilld
 the Kings daughter is found Such a deal of wonder is broken out
 within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it

 Enter another GENTLEMAN

 Here comes the Lady Paulinas steward he can deliver you more
 How goes it now sir This news which is calld true is so like
 an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion Has the
 King found his heir
 THIRD GENTLEMAN Most true if ever truth were pregnant by
 circumstance That which you hear youll swear you see there is
 such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermiones her
 jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with
 it which they know to be his character the majesty of the
 creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness
 which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences
 proclaim her with all certainty to be the Kings daughter
 Did you see the meeting of the two kings
 SECOND GENTLEMAN No
 THIRD GENTLEMAN Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen
 cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown
 another so and in such manner that it seemd sorrow wept to take
 leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up
 of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such
 distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour
 Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
 daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries O thy
 mother thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces
 his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping
 her Now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a
 weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns I never heard of
 such another encounter which lames report to follow it and
 undoes description to do it
 SECOND GENTLEMAN What pray you became of Antigonus that carried
 hence the child
 THIRD GENTLEMAN Like an old tale still which will have matter to
 rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was
 torn to pieces with a bear This avouches the shepherds son who
 has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but
 a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows
 FIRST GENTLEMAN What became of his bark and his followers
 THIRD GENTLEMAN Wreckd the same instant of their masters death
 and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments
 which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was
 found But O the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was
 fought in Paulina She had one eye declind for the loss of her
 husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilld She
 lifted the Princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing
 as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be
 in danger of losing
 FIRST GENTLEMAN The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
 kings and princes for by such was it acted
 THIRD GENTLEMAN One of the prettiest touches of all and that
 which angld for mine eyes caught the water though not the
 fish was when at the relation of the Queens death with the
 manner how she came tot bravely confessd and lamented by the
 King how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign
 of dolour to another she did with an Alas I would fain say
 bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most
 marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed If all
 the world could have seent the woe had been universal
 FIRST GENTLEMAN Are they returned to the court
 THIRD GENTLEMAN No The Princess hearing of her mothers statue
 which is in the keeping of Paulina a piece many years in doing
 and now newly performd by that rare Italian master Julio
 Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into
 his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is
 her ape He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say
 one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with
 all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend
 to sup
 SECOND GENTLEMAN I thought she had some great matter there in
 hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since
 the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we
 thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
 FIRST GENTLEMAN Who would be thence that has the benefit of
 access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our
 absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Lets along
 Exeunt GENTLEMEN
 AUTOLYCUS Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would
 preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son
 aboard the Prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I
 know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds
 daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much
 seasick and himself little better extremity of weather
 continuing this mystery remained undiscoverd But tis all one
 to me for had I been the finderout of this secret it would not
 have relishd among my other discredits

 Enter SHEPHERD and CLOWN

 Here come those I have done good to against my will and already
 appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
 SHEPHERD Come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and
 daughters will be all gentlemen born
 CLOWN You are well met sir You denied to fight with me this
 other day because I was no gentleman born See you these
 clothes Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman
 born You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born Give
 me the lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman born
 AUTOLYCUS I know you are now sir a gentleman born
 CLOWN Ay and have been so any time these four hours
 SHEPHERD And so have I boy
 CLOWN So you have but I was a gentleman born before my father
 for the Kings son took me by the hand and calld me brother and
 then the two kings calld my father brother and then the Prince
 my brother and the Princess my sister calld my father father
 And so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that
 ever we shed
 SHEPHERD We may live son to shed many more
 CLOWN Ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous
 estate as we are
 AUTOLYCUS I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I
 have committed to your worship and to give me your good report
 to the Prince my master
 SHEPHERD Prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
 gentlemen
 CLOWN Thou wilt amend thy life
 AUTOLYCUS Ay an it like your good worship
 CLOWN Give me thy hand I will swear to the Prince thou art as
 honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia
 SHEPHERD You may say it but not swear it
 CLOWN Not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins
 say it Ill swear it
 SHEPHERD How if it be false son
 CLOWN If it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear it in
 the behalf of his friend And Ill swear to the Prince thou art a
 tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I
 know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
 drunk But Ill swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall
 fellow of thy hands
 AUTOLYCUS I will prove so sir to my power
 CLOWN Ay by any means prove a tall fellow If I do not wonder
 how thou darst venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow
 trust me not Hark the kings and the princes our kindred are
 going to see the Queens picture Come follow us well be thy
 good masters Exeunt




SCENE III
Sicilia A chapel in PAULINAs house

Enter LEONTES POLIXENES FLORIZEL PERDITA CAMILLO PAULINA
LORDS and ATTENDANTS

 LEONTES O grave and good Paulina the great comfort
 That I have had of thee
 PAULINA What sovereign sir
 I did not well I meant well All my services
 You have paid home but that you have vouchsafd
 With your crownd brother and these your contracted
 Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
 It is a surplus of your grace which never
 My life may last to answer
 LEONTES O Paulina
 We honour you with trouble but we came
 To see the statue of our queen Your gallery
 Have we passd through not without much content
 In many singularities but we saw not
 That which my daughter came to look upon
 The statue of her mother
 PAULINA As she livd peerless
 So her dead likeness I do well believe
 Excels whatever yet you lookd upon
 Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it
 Lonely apart But here it is Prepare
 To see the life as lively mockd as ever
 Still sleep mockd death Behold and say tis well
 PAULINA draws a curtain and discovers HERMIONE
 standing like a statue
 I like your silence it the more shows off
 Your wonder but yet speak First you my liege
 Comes it not something near
 LEONTES Her natural posture
 Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed
 Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she
 In thy not chiding for she was as tender
 As infancy and grace But yet Paulina
 Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
 So aged as this seems
 POLIXENES O not by much
 PAULINA So much the more our carvers excellence
 Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
 As she livd now
 LEONTES As now she might have done
 So much to my good comfort as it is
 Now piercing to my soul O thus she stood
 Even with such life of majesty warm life
 As now it coldly stands when first I wood her
 I am ashamd Does not the stone rebuke me
 For being more stone than it O royal piece
 Theres magic in thy majesty which has
 My evils conjurd to remembrance and
 From thy admiring daughter took the spirits
 Standing like stone with thee
 PERDITA And give me leave
 And do not say tis superstition that
 I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady
 Dear queen that ended when I but began
 Give me that hand of yours to kiss
 PAULINA O patience
 The statue is but newly fixd the colours
 Not dry
 CAMILLO My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
 Which sixteen winters cannot blow away
 So many summers dry Scarce any joy
 Did ever so long live no sorrow
 But killd itself much sooner
 POLIXENES Dear my brother
 Let him that was the cause of this have powr
 To take off so much grief from you as he
 Will piece up in himself
 PAULINA Indeed my lord
 If I had thought the sight of my poor image
 Would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine
 Id not have showd it
 LEONTES Do not draw the curtain
 PAULINA No longer shall you gaze ont lest your fancy
 May think anon it moves
 LEONTES Let be let be
 Would I were dead but that methinks already
 What was he that did make it See my lord
 Would you not deem it breathd and that those veins
 Did verily bear blood
 POLIXENES Masterly done
 The very life seems warm upon her lip
 LEONTES The fixture of her eye has motion int
 As we are mockd with art
 PAULINA Ill draw the curtain
 My lords almost so far transported that
 Hell think anon it lives
 LEONTES O sweet Paulina
 Make me to think so twenty years together
 No settled senses of the world can match
 The pleasure of that madness Let t alone
 PAULINA I am sorry sir I have thus far stirrd you but
 I could afflict you farther
 LEONTES Do Paulina
 For this affliction has a taste as sweet
 As any cordial comfort Still methinks
 There is an air comes from her What fine chisel
 Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me
 For I will kiss her
 PAULINA Good my lord forbear
 The ruddiness upon her lip is wet
 Youll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
 With oily painting Shall I draw the curtain
 LEONTES No not these twenty years
 PERDITA So long could I
 Stand by a lookeron
 PAULINA Either forbear
 Quit presently the chapel or resolve you
 For more amazement If you can behold it
 Ill make the statue move indeed descend
 And take you by the hand but then youll think
 Which I protest against I am assisted
 By wicked powers
 LEONTES What you can make her do
 I am content to look on what to speak
 I am content to hear for tis as easy
 To make her speak as move
 PAULINA It is requird
 You do awake your faith Then all stand still
 Or those that think it is unlawful business
 I am about let them depart
 LEONTES Proceed
 No foot shall stir
 PAULINA Music awake her strike Music
 Tis time descend be stone no more approach
 Strike all that look upon with marvel Come
 Ill fill your grave up Stir nay come away
 Bequeath to death your numbness for from him
 Dear life redeems you You perceive she stirs
 HERMIONE comes down from the pedestal
 Start not her actions shall be holy as
 You hear my spell is lawful Do not shun her
 Until you see her die again for then
 You kill her double Nay present your hand
 When she was young you wood her now in age
 Is she become the suitor
 LEONTES O shes warm
 If this be magic let it be an art
 Lawful as eating
 POLIXENES She embraces him
 CAMILLO She hangs about his neck
 If she pertain to life let her speak too
 POLIXENES Ay and make it manifest where she has livd
 Or how stoln from the dead
 PAULINA That she is living
 Were it but told you should be hooted at
 Like an old tale but it appears she lives
 Though yet she speak not Mark a little while
 Please you to interpose fair madam Kneel
 And pray your mothers blessing Turn good lady
 Our Perdita is found
 HERMIONE You gods look down
 And from your sacred vials pour your graces
 Upon my daughters head Tell me mine own
 Where hast thou been preservd Where livd How found
 Thy fathers court For thou shalt hear that I
 Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
 Gave hope thou wast in being have preservd
 Myself to see the issue
 PAULINA Theres time enough for that
 Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
 Your joys with like relation Go together
 You precious winners all your exultation
 Partake to every one I an old turtle
 Will wing me to some witherd bough and there
 My mate thats never to be found again
 Lament till I am lost
 LEONTES O peace Paulina
 Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
 As I by thine a wife This is a match
 And made betweens by vows Thou hast found mine
 But how is to be questiond for I saw her
 As I thought dead and have in vain said many
 A prayer upon her grave Ill not seek far
 For him I partly know his mind to find thee
 An honourable husband Come Camillo
 And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
 Is richly noted and here justified
 By us a pair of kings Lets from this place
 What look upon my brother Both your pardons
 That eer I put between your holy looks
 My ill suspicion This your soninlaw
 And son unto the King whom heavens directing
 Is trothplight to your daughter Good Paulina
 Lead us from hence where we may leisurely
 Each one demand and answer to his part
 Performd in this wide gap of time since first
 We were disseverd Hastily lead away Exeunt
