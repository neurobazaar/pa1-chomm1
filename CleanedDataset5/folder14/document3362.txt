THE KENTONS


By William Dean Howells




I

The Kentons were not rich but they were certainly richer than the
average in the pleasant county town of the Middle West where they had
spent nearly their whole married life As their circumstances had
grown easier they had mellowed more and more in the keeping of their
comfortable home until they hated to leave it even for the short
outings which their children made them take to Niagara or the Upper
Lakes in the hot weather They believed that they could not be so well
anywhere as in the great square brick house which still kept its four
acres about it in the heart of the growing town where the trees
they had planted with their own hands topped it on three aides and a
spacious garden opened southward behind it to the summer wind Kenton
had his library where he transacted by day such law business as he had
retained in his own hands but at night he liked to go to his wifes
room and sit with her there They left the parlors and piazzas to their
girls where they could hear them laughing with the young fellows who
came to make the morning calls long since disused in the centres of
fashion or the evening calls scarcely more authorized by the great
world She sewed and he read his paper in her satisfactory silence or
they played checkers together She did not like him to win and when she
found herself unable to bear the prospect of defeat she refused to let
him make the move that threatened the safety of her men Sometimes
he laughed at her and sometimes he scolded but they were very good
comrades as elderly married people are apt to be They had long ago
quarrelled out their serious differences which mostly arose from
such differences of temperament as had first drawn them together they
criticised each other to their children from time to time but they
atoned for this defection by complaining of the children to each other
and they united in giving way to them on all points concerning their
happiness not to say their pleasure

They had both been teachers in their youth before he went into the war
and they had not married until he had settled himself in the practice
of the law after he left the army He was then a man of thirty and five
years older than she five children were born to them but the second
son died when he was yet a babe in his mothers arms and there was an
interval of six years between the first boy and the first girl Their
eldest son was already married and settled next them in a house which
was brick like their own but not square and had grounds so much less
ample that he got most of his vegetables from their garden He had grown
naturally into a share of his fathers law practice and he had taken it
all over when Renton was elected to the bench He made a show of giving
it back after the judge retired but by that time Kenton was well on in
the fifties The practice itself had changed and had become mainly the
legal business of a large corporation In this form it was distasteful
to him he kept the affairs of some of his old clients in his hands but
he gave much of his time which he saved his selfrespect by calling his
leisure to a history of his regiment inthe war

In his later life he had reverted to many of the preoccupations of his
youth and he believed that Tuskingum enjoyed the best climate on
the whole in the union that its people of mingled Virginian
Pennsylvanian and Connecticut origin with little recent admixture of
foreign strains were of the purest American stock and spoke the
best English in the world they enjoyed obviously the greatest sum of
happiness and had incontestibly the lowest death rate and divorce rate
in the State The growth of the place was normal and healthy it had
increased only to five thousand during the time he had known it which
was almost an ideal figure for a countytown There was a higher average
of intelligence than in any other place of its size and a wider and
evener diffusion of prosperity Its record in the civil war was less
brilliant perhaps than that of some other localities but it was
fully up to the general Ohio level which was the highwater mark of the
national achievement in the greatest war of the greatest people under
the sun It was Kentons pride and glory that he had been a part of the
finest army known in history He believed that the men who made history
ought to write it and in his first CommemorationDay oration he urged
his companions in arms to set down everything they could remember of
their soldiering and to save the letters they had written home so
that they might each contribute to a collective autobiography of the
regiment It was only in this way he held that the intensely personal
character of the struggle could be recorded He had felt his way to the
fact that every battle is essentially episodical very campaign a sum of
fortuities and it was not strange that he should suppose with his
want of perspective that this universal fact was purely national and
American His zeal made him the repository of a vast mass of material
which he could not have refused to keep for the soldiers who brought it
to him more or less in a humorous indulgence of his whim But he even
offered to receive it and in a community where everything took the
complexion of a joke he came to be affectionately regarded as a crank
on that point the shabbily aging veterans whom he pursued to their
workbenches and cornfields for the documents of the regimental
history liked to ask the colonel if he had brought his gun They
always give him the title with which he had been breveted at the
close of the war but he was known to the younger generation of his
fellowcitizens as the judge His wife called him Mr Kenton in the
presence of strangers and sometimes to himself but to his children she
called him Poppa as they did

The steadygoing eldest son who had succeeded to his fathers affairs
without giving him the sense of dispossession loyally accepted the
popular belief that he would never be the man his father was He joined
with his mother in a respect for Kentons theory of the regimental
history which was none the less sincere because it was unconsciously a
little sceptical of the outcome and the eldest daughter was of their
party The youngest said frankly that she had no use for any history
but she said the same of nearly everything which had not directly
or indirectly to do with dancing In this regulation she had use for
parties and picnics for buggyrides and sleighrides for calls from
young men and visits to and from other girls for concerts for plays
for circuses and church sociables for everything but lectures and
she devoted herself to her pleasures without the shadow of chaperonage
which was indeed a thing still unheard of in Tuskingum

In the expansion which no one else ventured or perhaps wished to set
bounds to she came under the criticism of her younger brother who
upon the rare occasions when he deigned to mingle in the family affairs
drew their mothers notice to his sisters excesses in carryingon and
required some action that should keep her from bringing the name
of Kenton to disgrace From being himself a boy of very slovenly and
lawless life he had suddenly at the age of fourteen caught himself up
from the street reformed his dress and conduct and confined himself in
his large room at the top of the house where on the pursuits to which
he gave his spare time the friends who frequented his society and the
literature which nourished his darkling spirit might fitly have been
written Mystery The sister whom he reprobated was only two years his
elder but since that difference in a girl accounts for a great deal it
apparently authorized her to take him more lightly than he was able
to take himself She said that he was in love and she achieved an
importance with him through his speechless rage and scorn which none
of the rest of his family enjoyed With his father and mother he had a
bearing of repressed superiority which a strenuous conscience kept from
unmasking itself in open contempt when they failed to make his sister
promise to behave herself Sometimes he had lapses from his dignified
gloom with his mother when for no reason that could be given he fell
from his habitual majesty to the tender dependence of a little boy
just as his voice broke from its nascent base to its earlier treble at
moments when he least expected or wished such a thing to happen His
stately but vague ideal of himself was supported by a stature beyond
his years but this rendered it the more difficult for him to bear the
humiliation of his sudden collapses and made him at other times the
easier prey of Lotties ridicule He got on best or at least most
evenly with his eldest sister She took him seriously perhaps because
she took all life so and she was able to interpret him to his father
when his intolerable dignity forbade a common understanding between
them When he got so far beyond his depth that he did not know what
he meant himself as sometimes happened she gently found him a safe
footing nearer shore

Kentons theory was that he did not distinguish among his children He
said that he did not suppose they were the best children in the world
but they suited him and he would not have known how to change them
for the better He saw no harm in the behavior of Lottie when it most
shocked her brother he liked her to have a good time but it flattered
his nerves to have Ellen about him Lottie was a great deal more
accomplished he allowed that she could play and sing and she had
social gifts far beyond her sister but he easily proved to his wife
that Nelly knew ten times as much

Nelly read a great deal she kept up with all the magazines and knew
all the books in his library He believed that she was a fine German
scholar and in fact she had taken up that language after leaving
school when if she had been better advised than she could have been in
Tuskingum she would have kept on with her French She started the first
book club in the place and she helped her father do the intellectual
honors of the house to the Eastern lecturers who always stayed with
the judge when they came to Tuskingum She was faithfully present at the
moments which her sister shunned in derision when her father explained
to them respectively his theory of regimental history and would just
as he said show them a few of the documents he had collected He
made Ellen show them she knew where to put her hand on the most
characteristic and illustrative and Lottie offered to bet what one
dared that Ellen would marry some of those lecturers yet she was
literary enough

She boasted that she was not literary herself and had no use for any
one who was and it could not have been her culture that drew the
most cultivated young man in Tuskingum to her Ellen was really more
beautiful Lottie was merely very pretty but she had charm for them
and Ellen who had their honor and friendship had no charm for them No
one seemed drawn to her as they were drawn to her sister till a man came
who was not one of the most cultivated in Tuskingum and then it was
doubtful whether she was not first drawn to him She was too transparent
to hide her feeling from her father and mother who saw with even more
grief than shame that she could not hide it from the man himself whom
they thought so unworthy of it

He had suddenly arrived in Tuskingum from one of the villages of the
county where he had been teaching school and had found something to do
as reporter on the Tuskingum Intelligencer which he was instinctively
characterizing with the spirit of the new journalism and was pushing as
hardily forward on the lines of personality as if he had dropped down
to it from the height of a New York or Chicago Sunday edition The judge
said with something less than his habitual honesty that he did not
mind his being a reporter but he minded his being light and shallow
he minded his being flippant and mocking he minded his bringing his
cigarettes and banjo into the house at his second visit He did not mind
his push the fellow had his way to make and he had to push but he did
mind his being all push and his having come out of the country with as
little simplicity as if he had passed his whole life in the city He
had no modesty and he had no reverence he had no reverence for Ellen
herself and the poor girl seemed to like him for that

He was all the more offensive to the judge because he was himself to
blame for their acquaintance which began when one day the fellow
had called after him in the street and then followed down the shady
sidewalk beside him to his hour wanting to know what this was he had
heard about his history and pleading for more light upon his plan in
it At the gate he made a flourish of opening and shutting it for the
judge and walking up the path to his door he kept his hand on the
judges shoulder most offensively but in spite of this Kenton had
the weakness to ask him in and to call Ellen to get him the most
illustrative documents of the history

The interview that resulted in the Intelligencer was the least evil
that came of this error Kenton was amazed and then consoled and then
afflicted that Ellen was not disgusted with it and in his conferences
with his wife he fumed and fretted at his own culpable folly and tried
to get back of the time he had committed it in that illusion which
people have with trouble that it could somehow be got rid of if it could
fairly be got back of till the time came when his wife could no longer
share his unrest in this futile endeavor

She said one night when they had talked late and long That cant be
helped now and the question is what are we going to do to stop it

The judge evaded the point in saying The devil of it is that all the
nice fellows are afraid of her they respect her too much and the very
thing which ought to disgust her with this chap is what gives him his
power over her I dont know what we are going to do but we must break
it off somehow

We might take her with us somewhere Mrs Kenton suggested

Run away from the fellow I think I see myself No we have got to stay
and face the thing right here But I wont have him about the house any
more understand that Hes not to be let in and Ellen mustnt see him
you tell her I said so Or no I will speak to her myself His wife
said that he was welcome to do that but he did not quite do it He
certainly spoke to his daughter about her lover and he satisfied
himself that there was yet nothing explicit between them But she was so
much less frank and open with him than she had always been before that
he was wounded as well as baffled by her reserve He could not get her
to own that she really cared for the fellow but man as he was and old
man as he was he could not help perceiving that she lived in a fond
dream of him

He went from her to her mother If he was only onehalf the man she
thinks he ishe ended his report in a hopeless sigh

You want to give in to her his wife pitilessly interpreted Well
perhaps that would be the best thing after all

No no it wouldnt Sarah it would be the easiest for both of us I
admit but it would be the worst thing for her Weve got to let it run
along for a while yet If we give him rope enough he may hang himself
theres that chance We cant go away and we cant shut her up and we
cant turn him out of the house We must trust her to find him out for
herself

Shell never do that said the mother Lottie says Ellen thinks hes
just perfect He cheers her up and takes her out of herself Weve
always acted with her as if we thought she was different from other
girls and he behaves to her as if she was just like all of them just
as silly and just as weak and it pleases her and flatters her she
likes it

Oh Lord groaned the father I suppose she does

This was bad enough it was a blow to his pride in Ellen but there was
something that hurt him still worse When the fellow had made sure of
her he apparently felt himself so safe in her fondness that he did not
urge his suit with her His content with her tacit acceptance gave the
bitterness of shame to the promise Kenton and his wife had made each
other never to cross any of their children in love They were ready
now to keep that promise for Ellen if he asked it of them rather
than answer for her lifelong disappointment if they denied him But
whatever he meant finally to do he did not ask it he used his footing
in their house chiefly as a basis for flirtations beyond it He began
to share his devotions to Ellen with her girl friends and not with her
girl friends alone It did not come to scandal but it certainly came to
gossip about him and a silly young wife and Kenton heard of it with
a torment of doubt whether Ellen knew of it and what she would do he
would wait for her to do herself whatever was to be done He was never
certain how much she had heard of the gossip when she came to her
mother and said with the gentle eagerness she had Didnt poppa talk
once of going South this winter

He talked of going to New York the mother answered with a throb of
hope

Well the girl returned patiently and Mrs Kenton read in her
passivity an eagerness to be gone from sorrow that she would not suffer
to be seen and interpreted her to her father in such wise that he could
not hesitate




II

If such a thing could be mercifully ordered the order of this event had
certainly been merciful but it was a cruel wrench that tore Kenton from
the home where he had struck such deep root When he actually came to
leave the place his going had a ghastly unreality which was heightened
by his sense of the common reluctance No one wanted to go so far as
he could make out not even Ellen herself when he tried to make her say
she wished it Lottie was in open revolt and animated her young men to
a share in the insurrection Her older brother was kindly and helpfully
acquiescent but he was so far from advising the move that Kenton had
regularly to convince himself that Richard approved it by making him
say that it was only for the winter and that it was the best way of
helping Ellen get rid of that fellow All this did not enable Kenton to
meet the problems of his younger son who required him to tell what he
was to do with his dog and his pigeons and to declare at once how he
was to dispose of the cocoons he had amassed so as not to endanger the
future of the moths and butterflies involved in them The boy was so
fertile in difficulties and so importunate for their solution that he
had to be crushed into silence by his father who ached in a helpless
sympathy with his reluctance

Kenton came heavily upon the courage of his wife who was urging forward
their departure with so much energy that he obscurely accused her of
being the cause of it and could only be convinced of her innocence when
she offered to give the whole thing up if he said so When he would not
say so she carried the affair through to the bitter end and she did
not spare him some pangs which she perhaps need not have shared with
him But people are seldom man and wife for half their lives without
wishing to impart their sufferings as well as their pleasures to each
other and Mrs Kenton if she was no worse was no better than other
wives in pressing to her husbands lips the cup that was not altogether
sweet to her own She went about the house the night before closing it
to see that everything was in a state to be left and then she came to
Kenton in his library where he had been burning some papers and getting
others ready to give in charge to his son and sat down by his cold
hearth with him and wrung his soul with the tale of the last things she
had been doing When she had made him bear it all she began to turn the
bright side of the affair to him She praised the sense and strength of
Ellen in the course the girl had taken with herself and asked him
if he really thought they could have done less for her than they were
doing She reminded him that they were not running away from the fellow
as she had once thought they must but Ellen was renouncing him and
putting him out of her sight till she could put him out of her mind She
did not pretend that the girl had done this yet but it was everything
that she wished to do it and saw that it was best Then she kissed
him on his gray head and left him alone to the first ecstasy of his
homesickness

It was better when they once got to New York and were settled in an
apartment of an oldfashioned downtown hotel They thought themselves
very cramped in it and they were but little easier when they found that
the apartments over and under them were apparently thought spacious for
families of twice their numbers It was the very quietest place in the
whole city but Kenton was used to the stillness of Tuskingum where
since people no longer kept hens the nights were stiller than in the
country itself and for a week he slept badly Otherwise as soon as
they got used to living in six rooms instead of seventeen they were
really very comfortable

He could see that his wife was glad of the release from housekeeping
and she was growing gayer and seemed to be growing younger in the
inspiration of the great goodnatured town They had first come to New
York on their wedding journey but since that visit she had always let
him go alone on his business errands to the East these had grown less
and less frequent and he had not seen New York for ten or twelve years
He could have waited as much longer but he liked her pleasure in the
place and with the homesickness always lurking at his heart he went
about with her to the amusements which she frequented as she said to
help Ellen take her mind off herself At the play and the opera he
sat thinking of the silent lonely house at Tuakingum dark among its
leafless maples and the life that was no more in it than if they had
all died out of it and he could not keep down a certain resentment
senseless and cruel as if the poor girl were somehow to blame for their
exile When he betrayed this feeling to his wife as he sometimes must
she scolded him for it and then offered if he really thought anything
like that to go back to Tuskingum at once and it ended in his having
to own himself wrong and humbly promise that he never would let the
child dream how he felt unless he really wished to kill her He was
obliged to carry his selfpunishment so far as to take Lottie very
sharply to task when she broke out in hot rebellion and declared that
it was all Ellens fault she was not afraid of killing her sister and
though she did not say it to her she said it of her that anybody else
could have got rid of that fellow without turning the whole family out
of house and home

Lottie in fact was not having a bit good time in New York which she
did not find equal in any way to Tuskingum for fun She hated the dull
propriety of the hotel where nobody got acquainted and every one was
as afraid as death of every one else and in her desolation she was
thrown back upon the society of her brother Boyne They became friends
in their common dislike of New York and pending some chance of bringing
each other under condemnation they lamented their banishment from
Tuskingum together But even Boyne contrived to make the heavy time
pass more lightly than she in the lessons he had with a tutor and the
studies of the city which he carried on When the skating was not good
in Central Park he spent most of his afternoons and evenings at the
vaudeville theatres None of the dime museums escaped his research
and he conversed with freaks and monsters of all sorts upon terms of
friendly confidence He reported their different theories of themselves
to his family with the same simplehearted interest that he criticised
the song and dance artists of the vaudeville theatres He became an
innocent but by no means uncritical connoisseur of their attractions
and he surprised with the constancy and variety of his experience in
them a gentleman who sat next him one night Boyne thought him a person
of cultivation and consulted him upon the opinion he had formed that
there was not so much harm in such places as people said The gentleman
distinguished in saying that he thought you would not find more harm in
them if you did not bring it with you than you would in the legitimate
theatres and in the hope of further wisdom from him Boyne followed him
out of the theatre and helped him on with his overcoat The gentleman
walked home to his hotel with him and professed a pleasure in his
acquaintance which he said he trusted they might sometime renew

All at once the Kentons began to be acquainted in the hotel as often
happens with people after they have long ridden up and down in the
elevator together in bonds of apparently perpetual strangeness From
one friendly family their acquaintance spread to others until they were
almost without knowing it suddenly and simultaneously on smiling and
then on speaking terms with the people of every permanent table in the
diningroom Lottie and Boyne burst the chains of the unnatural kindness
which bound them and resumed their old relations of reciprocal censure
He found a fellow of his own age in the apartment below who had the
same country traditions and was engaged in a like inspection of the
city and she discovered two girls on another floor who said they
received on Saturdays and wanted her to receive with them They made
a tea for her and asked some real New Yorkers and such a round of
pleasant little events began for her that Boyne was forced to call his
mothers attention to the way Charlotte was going on with the young men
whom she met and frankly asked to call upon her without knowing anything
about them you could not do that in New York he said

But by this time New York had gone to Mrs Kentons head too and
she was less fitted to deal with Lottie than at home Whether she had
succeeded or not in helping Ellen take her mind off herself she had
certainly freed her own from introspection in a dream of things which
had seemed impossible before She was in that moment of a womans life
which has a certain pathos for the intelligent witness when having
reared her children and outgrown the more incessant cares of her
motherhood she sometimes reverts to her girlish impulses and ideals
and confronts the remaining opportunities of life with a joyful hope
unknown to our heavier and sullener sex in its later years It is this
peculiar power of rejuvenescence which perhaps makes so many women
outlive their husbands who at the same age regard this world as an
accomplished fact Mrs Kenton had kept up their reading long after
Kenton found himself too busy or too tired for it and when he came
from his office at night and fell asleep over the book she wished him to
hear she continued it herself and told him about it When Ellen began
to show the same taste they read together and the mother was not
jealous when the father betrayed that he was much prouder of his
daughters culture than his wifes She had her own misgivings that she
was not so modern as Ellen and she accepted her judgment in the case of
some authors whom she did not like so well

She now went about not only to all the places where she could make
Ellens amusement serve as an excuse but to others when she could not
coax or compel the melancholy girl She was as constant at matinees
of one kind as Boyne at another sort she went to the exhibitions of
pictures and got herself up in schools of painting she frequented
galleries public and private and got asked to studio teas she went to
meetings and conferences of aesthetic interest and she paid an easy
way to parlor lectures expressive of the vague but profound ferment
in womens souls from these her presence in intellectual clubs was
a simple and natural transition She met and talked with interesting
people and now and then she got introduced to literary people Once
in a bookstore she stood next to a gentleman leaning over the same
counter whom a salesman addressed by the name of a popular author and
she remained staring at him breathless till he left the place When she
bragged of the prodigious experience at home her husband defied her to
say how it differed from meeting the lecturers who had been their guests
in Tuskingum and she answered that none of them compared with this
author and besides a lion in his own haunts was very different from
a lion going round the country on exhibition Kenton thought that was
pretty good and owned that she had got him there

He laughed at her to the children but all the same she believed that
she was living in an atmosphere of culture and with every breath she
was sensible of an intellectual expansion She found herself in the
enjoyment of so wide and varied a sympathy with interests hitherto
strange to her experience that she could not easily make people believe
she had never been to Europe Nearly every one she met had been several
times and took it for granted that she knew the Continent as well as
they themselves

She denied it with increasing shame she tried to make Kenton understand
how she felt and she might have gone further if she had not seen how
homesick he was for Tuskingum She did her best to coax him and scold
him into a share of the pleasure they were all beginning to have in New
York She made him own that Ellen herself was beginning to be gayer
she convinced him that his business was not suffering in his absence and
that he was the better from the complete rest he was having She defied
him to say then what was the matter with him and she bitterly
reproached herself in the event for not having known that it was not
homesickness alone that was the trouble When he was not going about
with her or doing something to amuse the children he went upon long
lonely walks and came home silent and fagged He had given up smoking
and he did not care to sit about in the office of the hotel where other
old fellows passed the time over their papers and cigars in the heat of
the glowing grates They looked too much like himself with their air of
unrecognized consequence and of personal loss in an alien environment
He knew from their dress and bearing that they were country people
and it wounded him in a tender place to realize that they had each left
behind him in his own town an authority and a respect which they could
not enjoy in New York Nobody called them judge or general or doctor
or squire nobody cared who they were or what they thought Kenton did
not care himself but when he missed one of them he envied him for
then he knew that he had gone back to the soft warm keeping of his own
neighborhood and resumed the intelligent regard of a community he had
grown up with There were men in New York whom Kenton had met in former
years and whom he had sometimes fancied looking up but he did not let
them know he was in town and then he was hurt that they ignored him He
kept away from places where he was likely to meet them he thought that
it must have come to them that he was spending the winter in New York
and as bitterly as his nature would suffer he resented the indifference
of the Ohio Society to the presence of an Ohio man of his local
distinction He had not the habit of clubs and when one of the pleasant
younger fellows whom he met in the hotel offered to put him up at one
he shrank from the courtesy shyly and almost dryly He had outlived the
period of active curiosity and he did not explore the city as he world
once have done He had no resorts out of the hotel except the basements
of the secondhand bookdealers He haunted these and picked up copies
of war histories and biographies which as fast as he read them he
sent off to his son at Tuskingum and had him put them away with
the documents for the life of his regiment His wife could see with
compassion if not sympathy that he was fondly strengthening by these
means the ties that bound him to his home and she silently proposed to
go back to it with him whenever he should say the word

He had a mechanical fidelity however to their agreement that they
should stay till spring and he made no sign of going as the
winter wore away to its end except to write out to Tuskingum minute
instructions for getting the garden ready He varied his visits to the
bookstalls by conferences with seedsmen at their stores and his wife
could see that he had as keen a satisfaction in despatching a rare find
from one as from the other

She forbore to make him realize that the situation had not changed and
that they would be taking their daughter back to the trouble the girl
herself had wished to escape She was trusting with no definite hope
for some chance of making him feel this while Kenton was waiting with
a kind of passionate patience for the term of his exile when he came in
one day in April from one of his long walks and said he had been up to
the Park to see the blackbirds But he complained of being tired and he
lay down on his bed He did not get up for dinner and then it was six
weeks before he left his room

He could not remember that he had ever been sick so long before and
he was so awed by his suffering which was severe but not serious that
when his doctor said he thought a voyage to Europe would be good for
him he submitted too meekly for Mrs Kenton Her heart smote her for
her guilty joy in his sentence and she punished herself by asking if it
would not do him more good to get back to the comfort and quiet of their
own house She went to the length of saying that she believed his attack
had been brought on more by homesickness than anything else But the
doctor agreed rather with her wish than her word and held out that his
melancholy was not the cause but the effect of his disorder Then she
took courage and began getting ready to go She did not flag even in the
dark hours when Kenton got back his courage with his returning strength
and scoffed at the notion of Europe and insisted that as soon as they
were in Tuskingum he should be all right again

She felt the ingratitude not to say the perfidy of his behavior
and she fortified herself indignantly against it but it was not her
constant purpose or the doctors inflexible opinion that prevailed
with Kenton at last a letter came one day for Ellen which she showed to
her mother and which her mother with her distress obscurely relieved
by a sense of its powerful instrumentality brought to the girls
father It was from that fellow as they always called him and it asked
of the girl a hearing upon a certain point in which it had just come
to his knowledge she had misjudged him He made no claim upon her and
only urged his wish to right himself with her because she was the one
person in the whole world after his mother for whose good opinion he
cared With some tawdriness of sentiment the letter was well worded
it was professedly written for the sole purpose of knowing whether when
she came back to Tuskingum she would see him and let him prove to her
that he was not wholly unworthy of the kindness she had shown him when
he was without other friends

What does she say the judge demanded

What do you suppose his wife retorted She thinks she ought to see
him

Very well then We will go to Europe

Not on my account Mrs Kenton consciously protested

No not on your account or mine either On Nellys account Where is
she I want to talk with her

And I want to talk with you Shes out with Lottie and when she comes
back I will tell her what you say But I want to know what you think
first

It was some time before they arrived at a common agreement as to what
Kenton thought and when they reached it they decided that they must
leave the matter altogether to Ellen as they had done before They
would never force her to anything and if after all that her mother
could say she still wished to see the fellow they would not deny her

When it came to this Ellen was a long time silent so long a time that
her mother was beginning restively to doubt whether she was going to
speak at all Then she drew a long silent breath I suppose I ought to
despise myself momma for caring for him when hes never really said
that he cared for me

No no her mother faltered

But I do I do she gave way piteously I cant help it He doesnt
say so even now

No he doesnt It hurt her mother to own the fact that alone gave her
hope

The girl was a long time silent again before she asked Has poppa got
the tickets

Why he wouldnt Ellen child till he knew how you felt her mother
tenderly reproached her

Hed better not wait The tears ran silently down Ellens cheeks and
her lips twitched a little between these words and the next she spoke
as if it were still of her father but her mother understood If he
ever does say so dont you speak a word to me momma and dont you let
poppa

No indeed I wont her mother promised Have we ever interfered
Ellen Have we ever tried to control you

He WOULD have said so if he hadnt seen that everybody was against
him The mother bore without reply the ingratitude and injustice that
she knew were from the childs pain and not from her will Where is his
letter Give me his letter She nervously twitched it from her mothers
hand and ran it into her pocket She turned away to go and put off her
hat which she still wore from coming in with Lottie but she stopped
and looked over her shoulder at her mother Im going to answer it and
I dont want you ever to ask me what Ive said Will you

No I wont Nelly

Well then

The next night she went with Boyne and Lottie to the apartment overhead
to spend their last evening with the young people there who were going
into the country the next day She came back without the others
who wished to stay a little longer as she said with a look of gay
excitement in her eyes which her mother knew was not happiness Mrs
Kenton had an impulse to sweep into her lap the lithograph plans of
the steamer and the passage ticket which lay open on the table before
herself and her husband But it was too late to hide them from Ellen
She saw them and caught up the ticket and read it and flung it down
again Oh I didnt think you would do it she burst out and she
ran away to her room where they could hear her sobbing as they sat
haggardly facing each other

Well that settles it said Benton at last with a hard gulp

Oh I suppose so his wife assented

On his part now he had a genuine regret for her disappointment from
the sad safety of the trouble that would keep them at home and on her
part she could be glad of it if any sort of comfort could come out of it
to him

Till she says go he added weve got to stay

Oh yes his wife responded The worst of it is we cant even go back
to Tuskingum He looked up suddenly at her and she saw that he had not
thought of this She made Tchk in sheer amaze at him

We wont cross that river till we come to it he said sullenly but
halfashamed The next morning the situation had not changed overnight
as they somehow both crazily hoped it might and at breakfast which
they had at a table grown more remote from others with the thinning out
of the winter guests of the hotel the father and mother sat down alone
in silence which was scarcely broken till Lottie and Boyne joined them

Wheres Ellen the boy demanded

Shes having her breakfast in her room Mrs Kenton answered

She says she dont want to eat anything Lottie reported She made
the man take it away again

The gloom deepened in the faces of the father and mother but neither
spoke and Boyne resumed the word again in a tone of philosophic
speculation I dont see how Im going to get along with those
European breakfasts They say you cant get anything but cold meat or
eggs and generally they dont expect to give you anything but bread and
butter with your coffee I dont think thats the way to start the day
do you poppa

Kenton seemed not to have heard for he went on silently eating and the
mother who had not been appealed to merely looked distractedly across
the table at her children

Mr Plumpton says hes coming down to see us off said Lottie
smoothing her napkin in her lap Do you know the time of day when the
boat sails momma

Yes her brother broke in and if I had been momma Id have boxed
your ears for the way you went on with him You fairly teased him to
come The way Lottie goes on with men is a shame momma

What time does the boat sail momma Lottie blandly persisted I
promised to let Mr Plumpton know

Yes so as to get a chance to write to him said Boyne I guess when
he sees your spelling

Momma Do wake up What time does our steamer sail

A light of consciousness came into Mrs Rentons eyes at last and she
sighed gently Were not going Lottie

Not going Why but weve got the tickets and Ive told

Your father has decided not to go for the present We may go later in
the summer or perhaps in the fall

Boyne looked at his fathers troubled face and said nothing but Lottie
was not stayed from the expression of her feelings by any illtimed
consideration for what her fathers might be I just know she fired
its something to do with that nasty Bittridge Hes been a bitter dose
to this family As soon as I saw Ellen have a letter I was sure it was
from him and she ought to be ashamed If I had played the simpleton
with such a fellow I guess you wouldnt have let me keep you from going
to Europe very much What is she going to do now Marry him Or doesnt
he want her to

Lottie said her mother and her father glanced up at her with a face
that silenced her

When youve been half as good a girl as Ellen has been in this whole
matter he said darkly it will be time for you to complain of the
way youve been treated

Oh yes I know you like Ellen the best said the girl defiantly

Dont say such a thing Lottie said her mother Your father loves
all his children alike and I wont have you talking so to him Ellen
has had a great deal to bear and she has behaved beautifully If we are
not going to Europe it is because we have decided that it is best not to
go and I wish to hear nothing more from you about it

Oh yes And a nice position it leaves me in when Ive been taking
goodbye of everybody Well I hope to goodness you wont say anything
about it till the Plumptons get away I couldnt have the face to meet
them if you did

It wont be necessary to say anything or you can say that weve merely
postponed our sailing People are always doing that

Its not to be a postponement said Kenton so sternly that no one
ventured to dispute him the children because they were afraid of him
and their mother because she was suffering for him

At the steamship office however the authorities represented that it
was now so near the date of his sailing that they could not allow him to
relinquish his passages except at his own risk They would try to sell
his ticket for him but they could not take it back and they could not
promise to sell it There was reason in what they said but if there had
been none they had the four hundred dollars which Kenton had paid
for his five berths and they had at least the advantage of him in
the argument by that means He put the ticket back in his pocketbook
without attempting to answer them and deferred his decision till he
could advise with his wife who after he left the breakfasttable upon
his errand to the steamship office had abandoned her children to their
own devices and gone to scold Ellen for not eating

She had not the heart to scold her when she found the girl lying face
downward in the pillow with her thin arms thrown up through the coils
and heaps of her looseflung hair She was so alight that her figure
scarcely defined itself under the bedclothes the dark hair and the
white outstretched arms seemed all there was of her She did not stir
but her mother knew she was not sleeping Ellen she said gently
you neednt be troubled about our going to Europe Your father has gone
down to the steamship office to give back his ticket

The girl flashed her face round with nervous quickness Gone to give
back his ticket

Yes we decided it last night Hes never really wanted to go and

But I dont wish poppa to give up his ticket said Ellen He must get
it again I shall die if I stay here momma We have got to go Cant
you understand that

Mrs Kenton did not know what to answer She had a strong superficial
desire to shake her daughter as a naughty child which has vexed its
mother but under this was a stir stronger pity for her as a woman
which easily prevailed Why but Ellen dear We thought from what you
said last night

But couldnt you SEE the girl reproached her and she began to cry
and turned her face into the pillow again and lay sobbing

Well said her mother after she had given her a little time you
neednt be troubled Your father can easily get the ticket again he can
telephone down for it Nothing has been done yet But didnt you really
want to stay then

It isnt whether I want to stay or not Ellen spoke into her pillow
You know that You know that I have got to go You know that if I saw
himOh why do you make me talk

Yes I understand child Then in the imperious necessity of blaming
some one Mrs Kenton added You know how it is with your father He is
always so precipitate and when he heard what you said last night it
cut him to the heart He felt as if he were dragging you away and this
morning he could hardly wait to get through his breakfast before he
rushed down to the steamship office But now its all right again and
if you want to go well go and your father will only be too glad

I dont want father to go against his will You said he never wanted to
go to Europe The girl had turned her face upon her mother again and
fixed her with her tearful accusing eyes

The doctors say he ought to go He needs the change and I think we
should all be the better far getting away

I shall not said Ellen But if I dont

Yes said her mother soothingly

You know that nothing has changed He hasnt changed and I havent If
he was bad hes as bad as ever and Im just as silly Oh its like a
drunkard I suppose they know its killing them but they cant give it
up Dont you think its very strange momma I dont see why I should
be so It seems as if I had no character at all and I despise myself
so Do you believe I shall ever get over it Sometimes I think the best
thing for me would be to go into an asylum

Oh yes dear youll get over it and forget it all As soon as you see
othersother scenesand get interested

And you dont you dont think Id better let him come and

Ellen

Ellen began to sob again and toss her head upon the pillow What shall
I do What shall I do she wailed He hasnt ever done anything bad to
me and if I can overlook hishis flirtingwith that horrid thing
I dont know what the rest of you have got to say And he says he can
explain everything Why shouldnt I give him the chance momma I do
think it is acting very cruel not to let him even say a word

You can see him if you wish Ellen said her mother gravely Your
father and I have always said that And perhaps it would be the best
thing after all

Oh you say that because you think that if I did see him I should be
so disgusted with him that Id never want to speak to him again But
what if I shouldnt

Then we should wish you to do whatever you thought was for your
happiness Ellen We cant believe it would be for your good but if it
would be for your happiness we are willing Or if you dont think its
for your happiness but only for his and you wish to do it still we
shall be willing and you know that as far as your father and I are
concerned there will never be a word of reproachnot a whisper

Lottie would despise me and what would Richard say

Richard would never say anything to wound you dear and if you dont
despise yourself you neednt mind Lottie

But I should momma thats the worst of it I should despise myself
and he would despise me too No if I see him I am going to do it
because I am selfish and wicked and wish to have my own way no matter
who is harmed by it oranything and Im not going to have it put on
any other ground I could see him she said as if to herself just
once moreonly once moreand then if I didnt believe in him I could
start right off to Europe

Her mother made no answer to this and Ellen lay awhile apparently
forgetful of her presence inwardly dramatizing a passionate scene of
dismissal between herself and her false lover She roused herself from
the reverie with a long sigh and her mother said Wont you have some
breakfast now Ellen

Yes and I will get up You neednt be troubled any more about me
momma I will write to him not to come and poppa must go back and get
his ticket again

Not unless you are doing this of your own free will child I cant
have you feeling that we are putting any pressure upon you

Youre not Im doing it of my own will If it isnt my free will that
isnt your fault I wonder whose fault it is Mine or what made me so
silly and weak

You are not silly and weak said her mother fondly and she bent over
the girl and would have kissed her but Ellen averted her face with
a piteous Dont and Mrs Kenton went out and ordered her breakfast
brought back

She did not go in to make her eat it as she would have done in the
beginning of the girls trouble they had all learned how much better
she was for being left to fight her battles with herself singlehanded
Mrs Kenton waited in the parlor till her husband same in looking
gloomy and tired He put his hat down and sank into a chair without
speaking Well she said

We have got to lose the price of the ticket if we give it back I
thought I had better talk with you first said Kenton and he explained
the situation

Then you had better simply have it put off till the next steamer I
have been talking with Ellen and she doesnt want to stay She wants
to go His wife took advantage of Kentons mute amaze in the nervous
vagaries even of the women nearest him a man learns nothing from
experience to put her own interpretation on the case which as it was
creditable to the girls sense and principle he found acceptable if not
imaginable And if you will take my advice she ended you will go
quietly back to the steamship office and exchange your ticket for the
next steamer or the one after that if you cant get good rooms and
give Ellen time to get over this before she leaves It will be much
better for her to conquer herself than to run away for that would
always give her a feeling of shame and if she decides before she goes
it will strengthen her pride and selfrespect and there will be less
dangerwhen we come back

Do you think hes going to keep after her

How can I tell He will if he thinks its to his interest or he can
make anybody miserable by it

Kenton said nothing to this but after a while he suggested rather
timorously as if it were something he could not expect her to approve
and was himself half ashamed of I believe if I do put it off Ill
run out to Tuskingum before we sail and look after a little matter of
business that I dont think Dick can attend to so well

His wife knew why he wanted to go and in her own mind she had already
decided that if he should ever propose to go she should not gainsay
him She had in fact been rather surprised that he had not proposed
it before this and now she assented without taxing him with his real
motive and bringing him to open disgrace before her She even went
further in saying Very well then you had better go I can get on very
well here and I think it will leave Ellen freer to act for herself if
you are away And there are some things in the house that I want and
that Richard would be sure to send his wife to get if I asked him and
I wont have her rummaging around in my closets I suppose you will want
to go into the house

I suppose so said Renton who had not let a day pass since he left
his house without spending half his homesick time in it His wife
suffered his affected indifference to go without exposure and trumped
up a commission for him which would take him intimately into the house




IV

The piety of his son Richard had maintained the place at Tuskingum in
perfect order outwardly and Kentons heart ached with tender pain as he
passed up the neatly kept walk from the gate between the blooming ranks
of syringas and snowballs to his door and witnessed the faithful
care that Richards hired man had bestowed upon every detail The grass
between the banks of roses and rhododendrons had been as scrupulously
lawnmowered and as sedulously gardenhosed as if Kenton himself had
been there to look after its welfare or had tended the shrubbery as
he used to do in earlier days with his own hand The oaks which he had
planted shook out their glossy green in the morning gale and in the
tuliptrees which had snowed their petals on the ground in wide circles
defined by the reach of their branches he heard the squirrels barking
a redbird from the woody depths behind the house mocked the catbirds
in the quincetrees The June rose was red along the trellis of the
veranda where Lottie ought to be sitting to receive the morning calls
of the young men who were sometimes quite as early as Kentons present
visit in their devotions and the sound of Ellens piano played
fitfully and absently in her fashion ought to be coming out
irrespective of the hour It seemed to him that his wife must open
the door as his steps and his sons made themselves heard on the walk
between the box borders in their upper orchard and he faltered a
little

Look here father said his son detecting his hesitation Why dont
you let Mary come in with you and help you find those things

No no said Kenton sinking into one of the wooden seats that flanked
the doorway I promised your mother that I would get them myself You
know women dont like to have other women going through their houses

Yes but Mary his son urged

Ah Its just Mary with her perfect housekeeping that your mother
wouldnt like to have see the way she left things said Kenton and he
smiled at the notion of any one being housekeeper enough to find a flaw
in his wifes My but this is pleasant he added He took off his
hat and let the breeze play through the lank thin hair which was still
black on his fine high forehead He was a very handsome old man with
a delicate aquiline profile of the perfect Roman type which is perhaps
oftener found in America than ever it was in Rome Youve kept it very
nice Dick he said with a generalizing wave of his hat

Well I couldnt tell whether you would be coming back or not and I
thought I had better be ready for you

I wish we were said the old man and we shall be in the fall or
the latter part of the summer But its better now that we should goon
Ellens account

Oh youll enjoy it his son evaded him

You havent seen anything of him lately Kenton suggested

He wasnt likely to let me see anything of him returned the son

No said the father Well He rose to put the key into the door and
his son stepped down from the little porch to the brick walk

Mary will have dinner early father and when youve got through here
youd better come over and lie down a while beforehand

Kenton had been dropped at eight oclock from a sleeper on the Great
Three and had refused breakfast at his sons house upon the plea that
the porter had given him a Southern cantaloupe and a cup of coffee on
the train and he was no longer hungry

All right he said I wont be longer than I can help He had got
the door open and was going to close it again

His son laughed Better not shut it father It will let the fresh air
in

Oh all right said the old man

The son lingered about giving some orders to the hired man in the
vegetable garden for an excuse in the hope that his father might
change his mind and ask him to come into the house with him he felt it
so forlorn for him to be going through those lifeless rooms alone
When he looked round and saw his father holding the door ajar as if
impatiently waiting for him to be gone he laughed and waved his hand
to him All right father Im going now But though he treated the
matter so lightly with his father he said grimly to his wife as he
passed her on their own porch on his way to his once I dont like to
think of father being driven out of house and home this way

Neither do I Dick But it cant be helped can it

I think I could help it if I got my hands on that fellow once

No you couldnt Dick Its not he thats doing it Its Ellen you
know that well enough and youve just got to stand it

Yes I suppose so said Richard Kenton

Of course my heart aches for your poor old father but so it would if
Ellen had some kind of awful sickness It is a kind of sickness and you
cant fight it any more than if she really was sick

No said the husband dejectedly You just slip over there after a
while Mary if fathers gone too long will you I dont like to have
him there alone

Deed and deed I wont Dick He wouldnt like it at all my spying
round Nothing can happen to him and I believe your mothers just made
an excuse to send him after something so that he can be in there alone
and realize that the house isnt home any more It will be easier for
him to go to Europe when he finds that out I believe in my heart that
was her idea in not wanting me to find the things for him and Im not
going to meddle myself

With the fatuity of a man in such things and with the fatuity of
age regarding all the things of the past Kenton had thought in his
homesickness of his house as he used to be in it and had never been
able to picture it without the family life As he now walked through the
empty rooms and up and down the stairs his pulse beat low as if in the
presence of death Everything was as they had left it when they went
out of the house and it appeared to Kenton that nothing had been
touched there since though when he afterwards reported to his wife that
there was not a speck of dust anywhere she knew that Mary had been going
through the house in their absence not once only but often and she
felt a pang of grateful jealousy He got together the things that Mrs
Kenton had pretended to want and after glancing in at the different
rooms which seemed to be lying stealthily in wait for him with their
emptiness and silence he went downstairs with the bundle he had made
and turned into his library He had some thought of looking at the
collections for his history but after pulling open one of the drawers
in which they were stored he pushed it to again and sank listlessly
into his leathercovered swivelchair which stood in its place before
the wide writingtable and seemed to have had him in it before he sat
down The table was bare except for the books and documents which he
had sent home from time to time during the winter and which Richard or
his wife had neatly arranged there without breaking their wraps He
let fall his bundle at his feet and sat staring at the ranks of books
against the wall mechanically relating them to the different epochs of
the past in which he or his wife or his children had been interested
in them and aching with tender pain He had always supposed himself a
happy and strong and successful man but what a dreary ruin his life had
fallen into Was it to be finally so helpless and powerless for with
all the defences about him that a man can have he felt himself fatally
vulnerable that he had fought so many years Why at his age should
he be going into exile away from everything that could make his days
bright and sweet Why could not he come back there where he was now
more solitary than he could be anywhere else on earth and reanimate the
dead body of his home with his old life He knew why in an immediate
sort but his quest was for the cause behind the cause What had he
done or left undone He had tried to be a just man and fulfil all
his duties both to his family and to his neighbors he had wished to be
kind and not to harm any one he reflected how as he had grown older
the dread of doing any unkindness had grown upon him and how he had
tried not to be proud but to walk meekly and humbly Why should he be
punished as he was stricken in a place so sacred that the effort to
defend himself had seemed a kind of sacrilege He could not make it out
and he was not aware of the tears of selfpity that stole slowly down
his face though from time to time he wiped them away

He heard steps in the hall without advancing and pausing which must be
those of his son coming back for him and with these advances and pauses
giving him notice of his approach but he did not move and at first
he did not look up when the steps arrived at the threshold of the room
where he sat When he lifted his eyes at last he saw Bittridge lounging
in the doorway with one shoulder supported against the doorjamb his
hands in his pockets and his hat pushed well back on his forehead In an
instant all Kentons humility and soft repining were gone Well what
is it he called

Oh said Bittridge coming forward He laughed and explained Didnt
know if you recognized me

I recognized you said Kenton fiercely What is it you want

Well I happened to be passing and I saw the door open and I thought
maybe Dick was here

It was on Kentons tongue to say that it was a good thing for him
Dick was not there But partly the sense that this would be unbecoming
bluster and partly the suffocating resentment of the fellows
impudence limited his response to a formless gasp and Bittridge went
on But Im glad to find you here judge I didnt know that you were
in town Family all well in New York He was not quelled by the silence
of the judge on this point but as if he had not expected any definite
reply to what might well pass for formal civility he now looked aslant
into his breastpocket from which he drew a folded paper I just got
hold of a document this morning that I think will interest you I was
bringing it round to Dicks wife for you The intolerable familiarity
of all this was fast working Kenton to a violent explosion but he
contained himself and Bittridge stepped forward to lay the paper on
the table before him Its the original roster of Company C in your
regiment and

Take it away shouted Kenton and take yourself away with it and he
grasped the stick that shook in his hand

A wicked light came into Bittridges eye as he drawled in lazy scorn
Oh I dont know Then his truculence broke in a malicious amusement
Why judge whats the matter He put on a face of mock gravity and
Kenton knew with helpless fury that he was enjoying his vantage He
could fall upon him and beat him with his stick leaving the situation
otherwise undefined but a moments reflection convinced Kenton that
this would not do It made him sick to think of striking the fellow as
if in that act he should be striking Ellen too It did not occur to him
that he could be physically worsted or that his vehement age would
be no match for the others vigorous youth All he thought was that it
would not avail except to make known to every one what none but her
dearest could now conjecture Bittridge could then publicly say and
doubtless would say that he had never made love to Ellen that if there
had been any lovemaking it was all on her side and that he had only
paid her the attentions which any young man might blamelessly pay a
pretty girl This would be true to the facts in the case though it was
true also that he had used every tacit art to make her believe him in
love with her But how could this truth be urged and to whom So far
the affair had been quite in the hands of Ellens family and they had
all acted for the best up to the present time They had given Bittridge
no grievance in making him feel that he was unwelcome in their house
and they were quite within their rights in going away and making it
impossible for him to see her again anywhere in Tuskingum As for his
seeing her in New York Ellen had but to say that she did not wish it
and that would end it Now however by treating him rudely Kenton was
aware that he had bound himself to render Bittridge some account of his
behavior throughout if the fellow insisted upon it

I want nothing to do with you sir he said less violently but
as he felt not more effectually You are in my house without my
invitation and against my wish

I didnt expect to find you here I came in because I saw the door
open and I thought I might see Dick or his wife and give them this
paper for you But Im glad I found you and if you wont give me any
reason for not wanting me here I can give it myself and I think I can
make out a very good case for you Kenton quivered in anticipation of
some mention of Ellen and Bittridge smiled as if he understood But he
went on to say I know that there were things happened after you first
gave me the run of your house that might make you want to put up the
bars againif they were true But they were not true And I can prove
that by the best of all possible witnessesby Uphill himself He stands
shoulder to shoulder with me to make it hot for any one who couples his
wifes name with mine

Humph Kenton could not help making this comment and Bittridge being
what he was could not help laughing

Whats the use he asked recovering himself I dont pretend that
I did right but you know there wasnt any harm in it And if there had
been I should have got the worst of it Honestly judge I couldnt tell
you how much I prized being admitted to your house on the terms I was
Dont you think I could appreciate the kindness you all showed me
Before you took me up I was alone in Tuskingum but you opened every
door in the place for me You made it home to me and you wont believe
it of course because youre prejudiced but I felt like a son and
brother to you all I felt towards Mrs Kenton just as I do towards my
own mother I lost the best friends I ever had when you turned against
me Dont you suppose Ive seen the difference here in Tuskingum Of
course the men pass the time of day with me when we meet but they
dont look me up and there are more nearsighted girls in this town
Kenton could not keep the remote dawn of a smile out of his eyes and
Bittridge caught the faroff gleam And everybodys been away the whole
winter Not a soul at home anywhere and I had to take my chance of
surprising Mrs Dick Kenton when I saw your door open here He laughed
forlornly as the gleam faded out of Kentons eye again And the worst
of it is that my own mother isnt at home to me figuratively speaking
when I go over to see her at Ballardsville She got wind of my
misfortune somehow and when I made a clean breast of it to her she
said she could never feel the same to me till I had made it all right
with the Kentons And when a mans own mother is down on him judge

Bittridge left Kenton to imagine the desperate case and in spite of his
disbelief in the man and all he said Kenton could not keep his hardness
of heart towards him I dont know what youre after young man he
began But if you expect me to receive you under my roof again

Oh I dont judge I dont Bittridge interposed All I want is to
be able to tell my motherI dont care for anybody elsethat I saw
you and you allowed me to say that I was truly sorry for the painif
it was pain or annoyance anywaythat I had caused you and to go back
to her with the hope of atoning for it sometime or somehow Thats all

Look here cried Renton What have you written to my daughter for

Wasnt that natural I prized her esteem more than I do yours even but
did I ask her anything more than Ive asked you I didnt expect her to
answer me all I wanted was to have her believe that I wasnt as black
as I was paintednot inside anyway You know well enoughanybody
knowsthat I would rather have her think well of me than any one else
in this world except my mother I havent got the gift of showing out
whats good in me if there is any good but I believe Miss Ellen would
want to think well of me if I gave her a chance If ever there was an
angel on earth shes one I dont deny that I was hopeful of mercy from
her because she cant think evil but I can lay my hand on my heart and
say that I wasnt selfish in my hopes It seemed to me that it was
her due to understand that a man whom she had allowed to be her friend
wasnt altogether unworthy Thats as near as I can come to putting into
words the motive I had in writing to her I cant even begin to put
into words the feeling I have towards her Its as if she was something
sacred

This was the feeling Renton himself had towards his daughter and for
the first time he found himself on common ground with the scapegrace
who professed it and whose light mocking face so little enforced his
profession If Bittridge could have spoken in the dark his words might
have carried a conviction of his sincerity but there in plain day
confronting the father of Ellen who had every wish to believe him true
the effect was different Deep within his wish to think the man honest
Kenton recoiled from him He vaguely perceived that it was because she
could not think evil that this wretch had power upon her and he was
sensible as he had not been before that she had no safety from him
except in absence He did not know what to answer he could not repel
him in open terms and still less could he meet him with any words that
would allow him to resume his former relations with his family He said
finally We will let matters stand We are going to Europe in a week
and I shall not see you again I will tell Mrs Kenton what you say

Thank you judge And tell her that I appreciate your kindness more
than I can say The judge rose from his chair and went towards the
window which he had thrown open Going to shut up Let me help you
with that window it seems to stick Everything fast upstairs

II think so Kenton hesitated

Ill just run up and look said Bittridge and he took the stairs two
at a time before Kenton could protest when they came out into the hall
together Its all right he reported on his quick return Ill just
look round below here and he explored the groundfloor rooms in turn
No you hadnt opened any other window he said glancing finally into
the library Shall I leave this paper on your table

Yes leave it there said Kenton helplessly and he let Bittridge
close the front door after him and lock it

I hope Miss Lottie is well he suggested in handing the key to Kenton
And Boyne he added with the cordiality of an old family friend
I hope Boyne has got reconciled to New York a little He was rather
anxious about his pigeons when he left I understand But I guess
Dicks man has looked after them Id have offered to take charge of the
cocoons myself if Id had a chance He walked gayly chatting across
the intervening lawn with Kenton to his sons door where at sight of
him bra Richard Kenton evanesced into the interior so obviously that
Bittridge could not offer to come in Well I shall see you all when
you come back in the fall judge and I hope youll have a pleasant
voyage and a good time in Europe

Thank you said Kenton briefly

Remember me to the ladies and Bittridge took off his hat with his
left hand while he offered the judge his right Well goodbye

Kenton made what response he could and escaped indoors where his
daughterinlaw appeared from the obscurity into which she had retired
from Bittridge Well that follow does beat all How in the world did
he find you father

He came into the house said the judge much abashed at his failure to
deal adequately with Bittridge He felt it the more in the presence of
his sons wife I couldnt seem to get rid of him in any way short of
kicking him out

No theres nothing equal to his impudence I do believe he would have
come in here if he hadnt seen me first Did you tell him when you were
going back father Because hed be at the train to see you off just as
sure

No I didnt tell him said Kenton feeling move shaken now from the
interview with Bittridge than he had realized before He was ashamed to
let Mary know that he had listened to Bittridges justification which
he now perceived was none and he would have liked to pretend that he
had not silently condoned his offences but Mary did not drive him to
these deceptions by any further allusions to Bittridge

Well now you must go into the sittingroom and lie down on the
lounge I promised Dick to make you Or would you rather go upstairs to
your room

I think Ill go to my room said Kenton

He was asleep there on the bed when Richard came home to dinner and
looked softly in He decided not to wake him and Mary said the sleep
would do him more good than the dinner At table they talked him over
and she told her husband what she knew of the mornings adventure

That was pretty tough for father said Richard I wouldnt go into
the house with him because I knew he wanted to have it to himself and
then to think of that dirty hound skulking in Well perhaps its for
the best It will make it easier for father to go and leave the place
and theyve got to go Theyve got to put the Atlantic Ocean between
Ellen and that fellow

It does seem as if something might be done his wife rebelled

Theyve done the best that could be done said Richard And if
that skunk hasnt got some sort of new hold upon father I shall be
satisfied The worst of it is that it will be all over town in an hour
that Bittridge has made up with us I dont blame father he couldnt
help it he never could be rude to anybody

I think Ill try if I cant be rude to Mr Bittridge if he ever
undertakes to show in my pretence that he has made it up with us said
Mary

Richard tenderly found out from his fathers shamefaced reluctance
later that no great mischief had been done But no precaution on his
part availed to keep Bittridge from demonstrating the good feeling
between himself and the Kentons when the judge started for New York the
next afternoon He was there waiting to see him off and he all but
took the adieus out of Richards hands He got possession of the judges
valise and pressed past the porter into the sleepingcar with it and
remained lounging on the arm of the judges seat making conversation
with him and Richard till the train began to move Then he ran outside
and waved his hand to the judges window in farewell before all that
leisure of Tuskingum which haunted the arrival and departure of the
trains

Mary Kenton was furious when her husband came home and reported the fact
to her

How in the world did he find out when father was going

He must have come to all the through trains since he say him yesterday
But I think even you would have been suited Mary if you had seen his
failure to walk off from the depot arminarm with me

I wouldnt have been suited with anything short of your knocking him
down Dick

Oh that wouldnt have done said Richard After a while he added
patiently Ellen is making a good deal of trouble for us

This was what Mary was thinking herself and it was what she might have
said but since Dick had said it she was obliged to protest She isnt
to blame for it

Oh I know she isnt to blame




V

The father of the unhappy girl was of the same mixed mind as he rode
sleeplessly back to New York in his berth and heard the noises of
slumber all round him From time to time he groaned softly and
turned from one cheek to the other Every halfhour or so he let his
windowcurtain fly up and lay watching the landscape fleeting past and
then he pulled the curtain down again and tried to sleep After passing
Albany he dozed but at Poughkeepsie a zealous porter called him
by mistake and the rest of the way to New York he sat up in the
smokingroom It seemed a long while since he had drowsed the thin nap
had not rested him and the old face that showed itself in the glass
with the frost of a two days beard on it was dryeyed and limply
squared by the fall of the muscles at the corners of the chin

He wondered how he should justify to his wife the thing which he felt as
accountable for having happened to him as if he could have prevented it
It would not have happened of course if he had not gone to Tuskingum
and she could say that to him now it seemed to him that his going
which had been so imperative before he went was altogether needless
Nothing but harm had come of it and it had been a selfish indulgence of
a culpable weakness

It was a little better for Kenton when he found himself with his family
and they went down together to the breakfast which the mother had
engaged the younger children to make as pleasant as they could for their
father and not worry him with talk about Tuskingum They had in fact
got over their first season of homesickness and were postponing their
longing for Tuskingum till their return from Europe when they would all
go straight out there Kenton ran the gauntlet of welcome from the black
elevatorboys and bellboys and the headwaiter who went before him to
pull out the judges chair with commanding frowns to his underlings
to do the like for the rest of the family and as his own clumsy Irish
waiter stood behind his chair breathing heavily upon the judges head
he gave his order for breakfast with a curious sense of having got home
again from some strange place He satisfied Boyne that his pigeons and
poultry had been well cared for through the winter and he told Lottie
that he had not met much of anybody except Dicks family before he
recollected seeing half a dozen of her young men at differed times She
was not very exacting about them and her mind seemed set upon Europe or
at least she talked of nothing else Ellen was quiet as she always was
but she smiled gently on her father and Mrs Kenton told him of the
girls preparations for going and congratulated herself on their wisdom
in having postponed their sailing in view of all they had to do and
she made Kenton feel that everything was in the best possible shape As
soon as she got him alone in their own room she said Well what is
it poppa

Then he had to tell her and she listened with ominous gravity She did
not say that now he could see how much better it would have been if he
had not gone but she made him say it for her and she would not let
him take comfort in the notion of keeping the fact of his interview with
Bittridge from Ellen It would be worse than useless He will write to
her about it and then she will know that we have been concealing it

Kenton was astonished at himself for not having thought of that And
what are you going to do Sarah

I am going to tell her said Mrs Kenton

Why didnt poppa tell me before the girl perversely demanded as soon
as her another had done so

Ellen you are a naughty child I have a great mind not to have a word
more to say to you Your father hasnt been in the house an hour Did
you want him to speak before Lottie and Boyne

I dont see why he didnt tell me himself I know there is something
you are keeping back I know there is some word

Oh you poor girl said her mother melting into pity against all
sense of duty Have we ever tried to deceive you

No Ellen sobbed with her face in her hands Now I will tell you
every word that passed said Mrs Kenton and she told as well as she
could remember all that the judge had repeated from Bittridge I dont
say he isnt ashamed of himself she commented at the end He ought to
be and of course he would be glad to be in with us again when we go
back but that doesnt alter his character Ellen Still if you cant
see that yourself I dont want to make you and if you would rather go
home to Tuskingum we will give up the trip to Europe

Its too late to do that now said the girl in cruel reproach

Her mother closed her lips resolutely till she could say Or you can
write to him if you want to

I dont want to said Ellen and she dragged herself up out of her
chair and trailed slowly out of the room without looking at her mother

Well the judge asked impatiently when he came in as soon after this
as he decently could They observed forms with regard to talking about
Ellen which after all were rather for themselves than for her Mrs
Kenton at least knew that the girl knew when they were talking about
her

She took it as well as I expected

What is she going to do

She didnt say But I dont believe she will do anything

I wish I had taken our tickets for next Saturday said Kenton

Well we must wait now said his wife If he doesnt write to her
she wont write to him

Has she ever answered that letter of his

No and I dont believe she will now

That night Ellen came to her mother and said she need not be afraid of
her writing to Bittridge He hasnt changed if he was wrong by coming
and saying those things to poppa and nothing has changed

That is the way I hoped you would see it Ellen Her mother looked
wistfully at her but the girl left her without letting her satisfy the
longing in the mothers heart to put her arms round her child and pull
her head down upon her breast for a cry

Kenton slept better that night than his wife who was kept awake by a
formless foreboding For the week that followed she had the sense of
literally pushing the hours away so that at times she found herself
breathless as if from some heavy physical exertion At such times she
was frantic with the wish to have the days gone and the day of their
sailing come but she kept her impatience from her husband and children
and especially from Ellen The girl was passive enough she was almost
willing and in the preparation for their voyage she did her share of
the shopping and discussed the difficult points of this business with
her mother and sister as if she had really been thinking about it all
But her mother doubted if she had and made more of Ellens sunken eyes
and thin face than of her intelligent and attentive words It was these
that she reported to her husband whom she kept from talking with Ellen
and otherwise quelled

Let her alone she insisted one morning of the last week What can
you do by speaking to her about it Dont you see that she is making the
best fight she can You will weaken her if you interfere Its less than
a week now and if you can only hold out I know she can

Kenton groaned Well I suppose youre right Sarah But I dont like
the idea of forcing her to go unless

Then you had better write to that fellow and ask him to come and get
her

This shut Kentons mouth and he kept on with his shaving When he
had finished he felt fresher if not stronger and he went down to
breakfast which he had alone not only with reference to his own
family but all the other guests of the hotel He was always so early
that sometimes the diningroom was not open when this happened he used
to go and buy a newspaper at the clerks desk for it was too early then
for the newsstand to be open It happened so that morning and he got
his paper without noticing the young man who was writing his name in
the hotel register but who looked briskly up when the clerk bade Kenton
goodmorning by name

Why judge he said and he put out a hand which Kenton took with
trembling reluctance and a dazed stare I thought you sailed last
Saturday

We sail next Saturday said Kenton

Well well Then I misunderstood said Bittridge and he added Why
this is money found in the road How are all the family Ive got my
mother here with me brought her on for a kind of a little outing
Shell be the most surprised woman in New York when I tell her youre
here yet We came to this hotel because we knew you had been here but
we didnt suppose you were here Well This is too good I saw Dick
Friday but he didnt say anything about your sailing I suppose he
thought I knew Didnt you tell me you were going in a week that day in
your house

Perhaps I did Kenton faltered out his eyes fixed on Bittridges with
a helpless fascination

Well it dont matter so long as youre here Mothers in the parlor
waiting for me I wont risk taking you to her now judgeright off the
train you know But I want to bring her to call on Mrs Kenton as soon
after breakfast as youll let me She just idolizes Mrs Kenton from
what Ive told her about her Our rooms ready He turned to the
clerk and the clerk called Front to a bellboy who ran up and took
Bittridges handbaggage and stood waiting to follow him into the
parlor Well you must excuse me now judge So long he said gayly
and Kenton crept feebly away to the diningroom

He must have eaten breakfast but he was not aware of doing so and the
events of his leaving the table and going up in the elevator and finding
himself in his wifes presence did not present themselves consecutively
though they must all have successively occurred It did not seem to him
that he could tell what he knew but he found himself doing it and her
hearing it with strange quiet

Very well she said I must tell Ellen and if she wishes we must
stay in and wait for their call

Yes the judge mechanically consented

It was painful for Mrs Kenton to see how the girl flushed when she
announced the fact of Bittridges presence for she knew what a strife
of hope and shame and pride there was in Ellens heart At first she
said that she did not wish to see him and then when Mrs Kenton would
not say whether she had better see him or not she added vaguely If
he has brought his mother

I think we must see them Ellen You wouldnt wish to think you had
been unkind and he might be hurt on his mothers account He seems
really fond of her and perhaps

No there isnt any perhaps momma said the girl gratefully But I
think we had better see them too I think we had better ALL see them

Just as you please Ellen If you prefer to meet them alone

I dont prefer that I want poppa to be there and Lottie and Boyne
even

Boyne objected when he was told that his presence was requested at this
family rite and he would have excused himself if the invitation had
been of the form that one might decline What do I want to see him
for he puffed He never cared anything about me in Tuskingum Whats
he want here anyway

I wish you to come in my son said his mother and that ended it

Lottie was not so tractable Very well momma she said But dont
expect me to speak to him I have some little selfrespect if the rest
of you havent Am I going to shake hands with him I never took the
least notice of him at home and Im not going to here

Bittridge decided the question of handshaking for her when they met
He greeted her glooming brother with a jolly Hello Boyne and without
waiting for the boys tardy response he said Hello Lottie to the
girl and took her hand and kept it in his while he made an elaborate
compliment to her good looks and her gain in weight She had come
tardily as a proof that she would not have come in at all if she had not
chosen to do so and Mrs Bittridge was already seated beside Ellen on
the sofa holding her hand and trying to keep her mobile inattentive
eyes upon Ellens face She was a little woman youthfully dressed
but not dressed youthfully enough for the dry yellow hair which curled
tightly in small rings on her skull like the wig of a ragdoll Her
restless eyes were round and deepset with the lids flung up out of
sight she had a lax formless mouth and an anxious smile with which
she constantly watched her son for his initiative while she recollected
herself from time to time long enough to smooth Ellens hand between
her own and say Oh I just think the world of Clarence and I guess
he thinks his mother is about right too and then did not heed what
Ellen answered

The girl said very little and it was Bittridge who talked for all
dominating the room with a large satisfied presence in which the judge
sat withdrawn his forehead supported on his hand and his elbow on the
table Mrs Kenton held herself upright with her hands crossed before
her stealing a look now and then at her daughters averted face but
keeping her eyes from Mrs Bittridge who whenever she caught Mrs
Kentons glance said something to her about her Clarence and how he
used to write home to her at Ballardsville about the Kentons so
that she felt acquainted with all of them Her reminiscences were
perfunctory Mrs Bittridge had voluntarily but one topic and that
was herself either as she was included in the interest her son must
inspire or as she included him in the interest she must inspire She
said that now they had met at last she was not going to rest till the
Kentons had been over to Ballardsville and made her a good long visit
her son had some difficulty in making her realize that the Kentons were
going to Europe Then she laughed and said she kept forgetting and she
did wish they were all coming back to Tuskingum

If it is a merit to treat a fatuous mother with deference Bittridge had
that merit His deference was of the caressing and laughing sort which
took the spectator into the joke of her peculiarities as something they
would appreciate and enjoy with him She had been a kittenish and petted
person in her youth perhaps and now she petted herself after she had
long ceased to be a kitten What was respectable and what was pathetic
in her was her wish to promote her sons fortunes with the Kentons but
she tried to do this from not a very clear understanding of her part
apparently and little sense of the means For Ellens sake rather
than hers the father and mother received her overtures to their liking
kindly they answered her patiently and Mrs Kenton even tried to lead
the way for her to show herself at her best by talking of her journey
on to New York and of the city and what she would see there to
interest her Lottie and Boyne sternly aloof together in one of their
momentary alliances listened to her replies with a silent contempt
that almost included their mother Kenton bore with the woman humbly and
sadly

He was in fact rather bewildered with the situation for which he felt
himself remotely if not immediately responsible Bittridge was there
among them not only on good terms but apparently in the character of a
more than tolerated pretendant to Ellens favor There were passages of
time is which the father was not sure that the fellow was not engaged
to his daughter though when these instants were gone he was aware that
there had been no overt lovemaking between them and Bittridge had never
offered himself What was he doing there then The judge asked himself
that without being able to answer himself So far as he could make
out his wife and he were letting him see Ellen and show her off to
his mother mainly to disgust her with them both and because they were
afraid that if they denied her to him it would be the worse for them
through her suffering The judge was not accustomed to apply the tests
by which people are found vulgar or not these were not of his simple
world all that he felt about Mrs Bittridge was that she was a very
foolish false person who was true in nothing but her admiration of her
rascal of a son he did not think of Bittridge as a rascal violently
but helplessly and with a heart that melted in pity for Ellen

He longed to have these people gone not so much because he was so
unhappy in their presence as because he wished to learn Ellens feeling
about them from his wife She would know whether Allen said anything
to her or not But perhaps if Mrs Kenton had been asked to deliver her
mind on this point at once she would have been a little puled All that
she could see and she saw it with a sinking of the heart was that
Ellen looked more at peace than she had been since Bittridge was last
in their house at Tuskingum Her eyes covertly followed him as he sat
talking or went about the room making himself at home among them as
if he were welcome with every one He joked her more than the rest and
accused her of having become a regular NewYorker he said he supposed
that when she came back from Europe she would not know anybody in
Tuskingum and his mother playing with Ellens fingers as if they had
been the fringe of a tassel declared that she must not mind him for he
carried on just so with everybody at the same time she ordered him to
stop or she would go right out of the room

She gave no other sign of going and it was her son who had to make the
movement for her at last she apparently did not know that it was her
part to make it She said that now the Kentons must come and return her
call and be real neighborly just the same as if they were all at home
together When her son shook hands with every one she did so too and
she said to each Well I wish you goodmorning and let him push her
before him in high delight with the joke out of the room

When they were gone the Kentons sat silent Ellen with a rapt smile on
her thin flushed face till Lottie said You forgot to ask him if
we might BREATHE poppa and paced out of the room in stately scorn
followed by Boyne who had apparently no words at the command of his
dumb rage Kenton wished to remain and he looked at his wife for
instruction She frowned and he took this for a sign that he had better
go and he went with a light sigh

He did not know what else to do with himself and he went down to the
readingroom He found Bittridge there smoking a cigar and the young
man companionably offered to bestow one upon him but the judge stiffly
refused saying he did not wish to smoke just then He noted that
Bittridge was still in his character of family favorite and his hand
trembled as he passed it over the smooth knob of his stick while he
sat waiting for the fellow to take himself away But Bittridge had
apparently no thought of going He was looking at the amusements for the
evening in a paper he had bought and he wished to consult the judge as
to which was the best theatre to go to that night he said he wanted to
take his mother Kenton professed not to know much about the New York
theatres and then Bittridge guessed he must get the clerk to tell him
But still he did not part with the judge He sat down beside him and
told him how glad he was to see his family looking so well especially
Miss Ellen he could not remember ever seeing her so stronglooking He
said that girl had captured his mother who was in love with pretty much
the whole Kenton family though

And bytheway he added I want to thank you and Mrs Kenton judge
for the way you received my mother You made her feel that she was among
friends She cant talk about anything else and I guess I shant have
much trouble in making her stay in New York as long as youre here She
was inclined to be homesick The fact is though I dont care to have it
talked about yet and I wish you wouldnt say anything to Dick about it
when you write home I think of settling in New York Ive been offered
a show in the advertising department of one of the big dailiesIm not
at liberty to say whichand its a tossup whether I stay here or go to
Washington Ive got a chance there too but its on the staff of a new
enterprise and Im not sure about it Ive brought my mother along to
let her have a look at both places though she doesnt know it and Id
rather you wouldnt speak of it before her Im going to take her on to
Washington before we go back I want to have my mother with me judge
Its better for a fellow to have that homefeeling in a large place from
the start it keeps him out of a lot of things and I dont pretend to
be better than other people or not more superhuman If Ive been able
to keep out of scrapes its more because Ive had my mother near me
and I dont intend ever to be separated from her after this till I
have a home of my own Shes been the guidingstar of my life

Kenton was unable to make any formal response and in fact he was so
preoccupied with the question whether the fellow was more a fool or
a fraud that he made no answer at all beyond a few inarticulate
grumblings of assent These sufficed for Bittridge apparently for he
went on contentedly Whenever Ive been tempted to go a little wild
the thought of how mother would feel has kept me on the track like
nothing else would No judge there isnt anything in this world like a
good mother except the right kind of a wife

Kenton rose and said he believed he must go upstairs Bittridge said
All right Ill see you later judge and swung easily off to advise
with the clerk as to the best theatre




VI

Kenton was so unhappy that he could not wait for his wife to come to him
in their own room he broke in upon her and Ellen in the parlor and at
his coming the girl flitted out in the noiseless fashion which of late
had made her father feel something ghostlike in her He was afraid
she was growing to dislike him and trying to avoid him and now he
presented himself quite humbly before his wife as if he had done wrong
in coming He began with a sort of apology for interrupting but his
wife said it was all right and she added We were not talking about
anything in particular She was silent and then she added again
Sometimes I think Ellen hasnt very fine perceptions after all She
doesnt seem to feel about people as I supposed she would

You mean that she doesnt feel as you would suppose about those
people

Mrs Kenton answered obliquely She thinks its a beautiful thing in
him to be so devoted to his mother

Humph And what does she think of his mother

She thinks she has very pretty hair

Mrs Kenton looked gravely down at the work she had in her hands and
Kenton did not know what to make of it all He decided that his wife
must feel as he did a doubt of the childs sincerity with sense of
her evasiveness more tolerant than his own Yet he knew that if it
came to a question of forcing Ellen to do what was best for her
or forbidding her to do what was worst his wife would have all the
strength for the work and he none He asked her hopelessly enough Do
you think she still cares for him

I think she wishes to give him another trial I hope she will Kenton
was daunted and he showed it She has got to convince herself and
we have got to let her She believes of course that hes here on her
account and that flatters her Why should she be so different from
other girls Mrs Kenton demanded of the angry protest in her husbands
eye

His spirit fell and he said I only wish she were more like them

Well then she is just as headstrong and as silly when it comes to a
thing like this Our only hope is to let her have her own way

Do you suppose he cares for her after all

Mrs Kenton was silent as if in exhaustive selfquestion Then she
answered No I dont in that way But he believes he can get her

Then Sarah I think we have a duty to the poor child You must tell
her what you have told me

Mrs Kenton smiled rather bitterly in recognition of the fact that the
performance of their common duty must fall wholly to her But she merely
said There is no need of my telling her She knows it already

And she would take him in spite of knowing that he didnt really care
for her

I dont say that She wouldnt own it to herself

And what are you going to do

Nothing We must let things take their course

They had a great deal more talk that came to the same end They played
their sad comedy he in the part of a father determined to save his
child from herself and she in hers of resisting and withholding him
It ended as it had so often ended beforehe yielded with more faith in
her wisdom than she had herself

At luncheon the Bittridges could not join the Kentons or be asked to do
so because the table held only four but they stopped on their way to
their own table the mother to bridle and toss in affected reluctance
while the son bragged how he had got the last two tickets to be had that
night for the theatre where he was going to take his mother He seemed
to think that the fact had a special claim on the judges interest and
she to wish to find out whether Mrs Kenton approved of theatregoing
She said she would not think of going in Ballardsville but she supposed
it was more rulable in New York

During the afternoon she called at the Kenton apartment to consult the
ladies about what she ought to wear She said she had nothing but a
black barege along and would that do with the hat she had on She had
worn it to let them see and now she turned her face from aide to side
to give them the effect of the plumes that fell like a dishevelled
featherduster round and over the crown Mrs Kenton could only say that
it would do but she believed that it was the custom now for ladies to
take their hats off in the theatre

Mrs Bittridge gave a hoarse laugh Oh dear Then Ill have to fix my
hair two ways I dont know what Clarence WILL say

The mention of her sons name opened the way for her to talk of him in
relation to herself and the rest of her stay passed in the celebration
of his filial virtues which had been manifest from the earliest period
She could not remember that she ever had to hit the child a lick she
said or that he had ever made her shed a tear

When she went Boyne gloomily inquired What makes her hair so much
darker at the roots than it is at the points and his mother snubbed
him promptly

You had no business to be here Boyne I dont like boys hanging about
where ladies are talking together and listening

This did not prevent Lottie from answering directly for Boyne and
indirectly for Ellen Its because its begun to grow since the last
bleach

It was easier to grapple with Boyne than with Lottie and Mrs Kenton
was willing to allow her to leave the room with her brother unrebuked
She was even willing to have had the veil lifted from Mrs Bittridges
hair with a rude hand if it world help Ellen

I dont want you to think momma said the girl that I didnt know
about her hair or that I dont see how silly she is But its all the
more to his credit if he can be so good to her and admire her Would
you like him better if he despised her

Mrs Kenton felt both the defiance and the secret shame from which it
sprang in her daughters words and she waited for a moment before she
answered I would like to be sure he didnt

If he does and if he hides it from her its the same as if he didnt
its better But you all wish to dislike him

We dont wish to dislike him Ellen goodness knows But I dont think
he would care much whether we disliked him or not I am sure your poor
father and I would be only too glad to like him

Lottie wouldnt said Ellen with a resentment her mother found
pathetic it was so feeble and aimless

Lottie doesnt matter she said She could not make out how nearly
Ellen was to sharing the common dislike or how far she would go in
fortifying herself against it She kept with difficulty to her negative
frankness and she let the girl leave the room with a fretful sigh as
if provoked that her mother would not provoke her further There were
moments when Mrs Kenton believed that Ellen was sick of her love and
that she would pluck it out of her heart herself if she were left alone
She was then glad Bittridge had come so that Ellen might compare with
the reality the counterfeit presentment she had kept in her fancy and
she believed that if she could but leave him to do his worst it would
be the best for Ellen

In the evening directly after dinner Bittridge sent up his name for
Mrs Kenton The judge had remained to read his paper below and Lottie
and Boyne had gone to some friends in another apartment It seemed to
Mrs Kenton a piece of luck that she should be able to see him alone
and she could not have said that she was unprepared for him to come in
holding his theatretickets explanatorily in his hand or surprised when
he began

Mrs Kenton my mothers got a bad headache and Ive come to ask a
favor of you She cant use her ticket for tonight and I want you to
let Miss Ellen come with me Will you

Bittridge had constituted himself an old friend of the whole family from
the renewal of their acquaintance and Mrs Kenton was now made aware of
his being her peculiar favorite in spite of the instant repulsion she
felt she was not averse to what he proposed Her fear was that Ellen
would be so or that she could keep from influencing her to this test
of her real feeling for Bittridge I will ask her Mr Bittridge she
said with a severity which was a preliminary of the impartiality she
meant to use with Ellen

Well thats right he answered and while she went to the girls room
he remained examining the details of the drawingroom decorations in
easy security which Mrs Kenton justified on her return

Ellen will be ready to go with you Mr Bittridge

Well thats good said the young man and while he talked on she sat
wondering at a nature which all modesty and deference seemed left
out of though he had sometimes given evidence of his intellectual
appreciation of these things He talked to Mrs Kenton not only as if
they were in everywise equal but as if they were of the same age
almost of the same sex

Ellen came in cloaked and hatted with her delicate face excited in
prospect of the adventure and her mother saw Bittridge look at her with
more tenderness than she had ever seen in him before Ill take good
care of her Mrs Kenton he said and for the first time she felt
herself relent a little towards him

A minute after they were gone Lottie bounced into the room followed by
Boyne

Momma she shouted Ellen isnt going to the theatre with that
fellow

Yes she is

And you let her momma Without a chaperon

Boynes face had mirrored the indignation in his sisters but at
this unprecedented burst of conventionality he forgot their momentary
alliance Well youre a pretty one to talk about chaperons Walking
all over Tuskingum with fellows at night and going buggyriding with
everybody and out rowing and here fairly begging Jim Plumpton to come
down to the steamer and see you off again

Shut up Lottie violently returned or Ill tell momma how youve
been behaving with Rita Plumpton yourself

Well tell Boyne defied her

Oh it dont matter what a brat of a boy says or does anyway said
Lottie But I think Ellen is disgracing the family Everybody in the
hotel is laughing at that wiggy old Mrs Bittridge with her wobbly
eyes and they can see that hes just as green The Plumptons have been
laughing so about them and I told them that we had nothing to do with
them at home and had fairly turned Bittridge out of the house but he
had impudence enough for anything and now to find Ellen going off to
the theatre with him alone

Lottie began to cry with vexation as she whipped out of the room and
Boyne who felt himself drawn to her side again said very seriously
Well it aint the thing in New York you know momma and anybody can
see what a jay Bittridge is I think its too bad to let her

It isnt for you to criticise your mother Boyne said Mrs Kenton
but she was more shaken than she would allow Her own traditions were so
simple that the point of etiquette which her children had urged had not
occurred to her The question whether Ellen should go with Bittridge at
all being decided she would of course go in New York as she would go
in Tuskingum Now Mrs Kenton perceived that she must not and she had
her share of humiliation in the impression which his mother as her
friend apparently was making with her childrens acquaintances in the
hotel If they would think everybody in Tuskingum was like her it
would certainly be very unpleasant but she would not quite own this
to herself still less to a fourteenyearold boy I think what your
father and I decide to be right will be sufficient excuse for you with
your friends

Does father know it Boyne asked most unexpectedly

Having no other answer ready Mrs Kenton said You had better go to
bed my son

Well he grumbled as he left the room I dont know where all the
pride of the Kentons is gone to

In his sense of fallen greatness he attempted to join Lottie in her
room but she said Go away nasty thing and Boyne was obliged to
seek his own room where he occupied himself with a contrivance he was
inventing to enable you to close your door and turn off your gas by
a system of pulleys without leaving your bed when you were tired of
reading

Mrs Kenton waited for her husband in much less comfort and when he
came and asked restlessly Where are the children she first told
him that Lottie and Boyne were in their rooms before she could bring
herself to say that Ellen had gone to the theatre with Bittridge

It was some relief to have him take it in the dull way he did and to
say nothing worse than Did you think it was well to have her

You may be sure I didnt want her to But what would she have said if
I had refused to let her go I can tell you it isnt an easy matter to
manage her in this business and its very easy for you to criticise
without taking the responsibility

Im not criticising said Kenton I know you have acted for the
best

The children said Mrs Kenton wishing to be justified further
think she ought to have had a chaperon I didnt think of that it
isnt the custom at home but Lottie was very saucy about it and I had
to send Boyne to bed I dont think our children are very much comfort
to us

They are good children Kenton said saidprovisionally

Yes that is the worst of it If they were bad we wouldnt expect any
comfort from them Ellen is about perfect Shes as near an angel as a
child can be but she could hardly have given us more anxiety if she had
been the worst girl in the world

Thats true the father sadly assented

She didnt really want to go with him tonight Ill say that for her
and if I had said a single word against it she wouldnt have gone But
all at once while she sat there trying to think how I could excuse
her she began asking me what she should wear Theres something strange
about it Rufus If I believed in hypnotism I should say she had gone
because he willed her to go

I guess she went because she wanted to go because shes in love with
him said Kenton hopelessly

Yes Mrs Kenton agreed I dont see how she can endure the sight of
him Hes handsome enough she added with a womans subjective logic
And theres something fascinating about him Hes very graceful and
hes got a good figure

Hes a hound said Kenton exhaustively

Oh yes hes a hound she sighed as if there could be no doubt on
that point It dont seem right for him to be in the same room with
Ellen But its for her to say I feel more and more that we cant
interfere without doing harm I suppose that if she were not so
innocent herself she would realize what he was better But I do think he
appreciates her innocence He shows more reverence for her than for any
one else

How was it his mother didnt go asked Kenton

She had a headache he said But I dont believe that He always
intended to get Ellen to go And thats another thing Lottie was vexed
about she says everybody is laughing at Mrs Bittridge and its
mortifying to have people take her for a friend of ours

If there were nothing worse than that said Kenton I guess we could
live through it Well I dont know how its going to all end

They sat talking sadly but finding a certain comfort in their mutual
discouragement and in their knowledge that they were doing the best
they could for their child whose freedom they must not infringe so far
as to do what was absolutely best and the time passed not so heavily
till her return This was announced by the mounting of the elevator to
their landing and then by low rapid pleading in a mans voice outside
Kenton was about to open the door when there came the formless noise of
what seemed a struggle and Ellens voice rose in a muffed cry Oh Oh
Let me be Go away I hate you Kenton the door open and Ellen burst
in running to hide her face in her mothers breast where she sobbed
out Hehe kissed me like a terrified child more than an insulted
woman Through the open door came the clatter of Bittridges feet as he
ran downstairs




VII

When Mrs Kenton came from quieting the hysterical girl in her room she
had the task almost as delicate and difficult of quieting her husband
She had kept him by the most solemn and exhaustive entreaty from
following Bittridge downstairs and beating him with his stick and now
she was answerable to him for his forbearance If you dont behave
yourself Rufus she had to say you will have some sort of stroke
After all theres no harm done

No harm Do you call it no harm for that hound to kiss Ellen

He wouldnt have attempted it unless something had led up to it I
suppose

Sarah How can you speak so of that angel

Oh that angel is a girl like the rest You kissed me before we were
engaged

That was very different

I dont see how If your daughter is so sacred why wasnt her mother
You men dont think your wives are sacred Thats it

No no Sarah Its because I dont think of you as apart from myself
that I cant think of you as I do of Ellen I beg your pardon if I
seemed to set her above you But when I kissed you we were very young
and we lived in a simple day when such things meant no harm and I was
very fond of you and you were the holiest thing in the world to me Is
Ellen holy to that fellow

I know Mrs Kenton relented Im not comparing him to you And there
is a difference with Ellen She isnt like other girls If it had been
Lottie

I shouldnt have liked it with Lottie either said the major
stiffly But if it had been Lottie she would have boxed his ears for
him instead of running to you Lottie can take care of herself And I
will take care of Ellen When I see that scoundrel in the morning

What will you do an old man like you I can tell you its something
youve just got to bear it if you dont want the scandal to fill the
whole hotel Its a very fortunate thing after all Itll put an end to
the whole affair

Do you think so Sarah If I believed that What does Ellen say

Nothing she wont say anythingjust cries and hides her face I
believe she is ashamed of having made a scene before us But I know that
shes so disgusted with him that she will never look at him again and
if its brought her to that I should think his kissing her the greatest
blessing in the world to us all Yes Ellen

Mrs Kenton hurried off at a faint call from the girls room and when
she came again she sat down to a long discussion of the situation with
her husband while she slowly took down her hair and prepared it for
the night Her conclusion which she made her husbands was that it
was most fortunate they should be sailing so soon and that it was the
greatest pity they were not sailing in the morning She wished him to
sleep whether she slept herself or not and she put the most hopeful
face possible upon the matter One thing you can rest assured of
Rufus and that is that its all over with Ellen She may never speak to
you about him and you mustnt ever mention him but she feels just as
you could wish Does that satisfy you Some time I will tell you all she
says

I dont care to hear said Kenton All I want is for him to keep away
from me I think if he spoke to me I should kill him

Rufus

I cant help it Sarah I feel outraged to the bottom of my soul I
could kill him

Mrs Kenton turned her head and looked steadfastly at him over her
shoulder If you strike him if you touch him Mr Kenton you will
undo everything that the abominable wretch has done for Ellen and you
will close my mouth and tie my hands Will you promise that under no
provocation whatever will you do him the least harm I know Ellen better
than you do and I know that you will make her hate you unless

Oh I will promise You neednt be afraid Lord help me Kenton
groaned I wont touch him But dont expect me to speak to him

No I dont expect that He wont offer to speak to you

They slept and in the morning she stayed to breakfast with Ellen
in their apartment and let her husband go down with their younger
children She could trust him now whatever form his further trial
should take and he felt that he was pledging himself to her anew when
Bittridge came hilariously to meet him in the readingroom where he
went for a paper after breakfast

Ah judge said the young man gayly Hello Boyne he added to the
boy who had come with his father Lottie had gone directly upstairs
from the breakfastroom I hope youre all well this morning Play not
too much for Miss Ellen

Kenton looked him in the face without answering and then tried to get
away from him but Bittridge followed him up talking and ignoring his
silence

It was a splendid piece judge You must take Mrs Kenton I know
youll both like it I havent ever seen Miss Ellen so interested I
hope the walk home didnt fatigue her I wanted to get a cab but she
would walk The judge kept moving on with his head down He did not
speak and Bittridge was forced to notice his silence Nothing the
matter I hope with Miss Ellen judge

Go away said the judge in a low voice fumbling the head of his
stick

Why whats up asked Bittridge and he managed to get in front of
Kenton and stay him at a point where Kenton could not escape It was a
corner of the room to which the old man had aimlessly tended with no
purpose but to avoid him

I wish you to let me alone sir said Kenton at last I cant speak
to you

I understand what you mean judge said Bittridge with a grin all
the more maddening because it seemed involuntary But I can explain
everything I just want a few words with you Its very important its
life or death with me sir he said trying to look grave Will you
let me go to your rooms with you

Kenton made no reply

Bittridge began to laugh Then lets sit down here or in the ladies
parlor It wont take me two minutes to make everything right If you
dont believe Im in earnest I know you dont think I am but I can
assure youWill you let me speak with you about Miss Ellen

Still Kenton did not answer shutting his lips tight and remembering
his promise to his wife

Bittridge laughed as if in amusement at what he had done Judge let
me say two words to you in private If you cant now tell me when you
can Were going back this evening mother and I are she isnt well
and Im not going to take her to Washington I dont want to go leaving
you with the idea that I wanted to insult Miss Ellen I care too much
for her I want to see you and Mrs Kenton about it I do indeed And
wont you let me see you somewhere

Kenton looked away first to one side and then to another and seemed
stifling

Wont you speak to me Wont you answer me See here Id get down on
my knees to you if it would do you any good Where will you talk with
me

Nowhere shouted Kenton Will you go away or shall I strike you with
my stick

Oh I dont think said Bittridge and suddenly in the wantonness of
his baffled effrontery he raised his hand and rubbed the back of it in
the old mans face

Boyne Kenton struck wildly at him and Bittridge caught the boy by the
arm and flung him to his knees on the marble floor The men reading in
the armchairs about started to their feet a porter came running
and took hold of Bittridge Do you want an officer Judge Kenton he
panted

No no Kenton answered choking and trembling Dont arrest him I
wish to go to my rooms thats all Let him go Dont do anything about
it

Ill help you judge said the porter Take hold of this fellow he
said to two other porters who came up Take him to the desk and
tell the clerk he struck Judge Kenton but the judge dont want him
arrested

Before Kenton reached the elevator with Boyne who was rubbing his
knees and fighting back the tears he heard the clerks voice saying
formally to the porters Baggage out of 35 and 37 and adding as
mechanically to Bittridge Your rooms are wanted Get out of them at
once

It seemed the gathering of neighborhood about Kenton where he had felt
himself so unfriended against the outrage done him and he felt the
sweetness of being personally championed in a place where he had thought
himself valued merely for the profit that was in him his eyes filled
and his voice failed him in thanking the elevatorboy for running before
him to ring the bell of his apartment




VIII

The next day in Tuskingum Richard Kenton found among the letters of
his last mail one which he easily knew to be from his sister Lottie
by the tightly curledup handwriting and by the unliterary look of the
slanted and huddled address of the envelope The only doubt he could
have felt in opening it was from the unwonted length at which she had
written him Lottie usually practised a laconic brevity in her notes
which were suited to the poverty of her written vocabulary rather than
the affluence of her spoken word

 Dear Dick her letter ran tripping and stumbling in its course
 I have got to tell you about something that has just happened here
 and you needent laugh at the speling or the way I tell it but just
 pay attention to the thing itself if you please That disgusting
 Bittridge has been here with his horrid wiggy old mother and momma
 let him take Ellen to the theatre On the way home he tried to make
 her promise she would marry him and at the door he kissed her They
 had an awful night with her hiseterics and I heard momma going in
 and out and trying to comfort her till daylight nearly In the
 morning I went down with poppy and Boyne to breakfast and after I
 came up father went to the readingroom to get a paper and that
 Bittridge was there waiting for him and wanted to speak with him
 about Ellen Poppa wouldent say a word to him and he kept
 following poppa up to make him Boyne says be wouldent take no for
 an ansir and hung on and hungon till poppa threatened to hitt him
 with his cane Then he saw it was no use and he took his hand and
 rubbed it in poppas face and Boyne believes he was trying to pull
 poppas nose Boyne acted like I would have done he pounded
 Bittridge in the back but of course Bittridge was too strong for
 him and threw him on the floor and Boyne scraped his knee so that
 it bledd Then the porters came up and caught Bittridge and
 wanted to send for a policeman but father wouldent let them and
 the porters took Bittridge to the desk and the clerk told him to get
 out instantly and they left as soon as old Wiggy could get her
 things on I dont know where they went but he told poppa they
 were going home today any way Now Dick I dont know what you
 will want to do and I am not going to put you up to anything but I
 know what I would do pretty well the first time Bittridge showed
 himself in Tuskingum You can do just as you please and I dont
 ask you to believe me if youre think Im so exciteable that I cant
 tell the truth I guess Boyne will say the same Much love to
 Mary Your affectionate sister

 Lottie

 P SEvery word Lottie says is true but I am not sure he meant
 to pull his nose The reason why he threw me down so easily is I
 have grown about a foot and I have not got up my strength BOYNE

 This is strictly confidential They dont know we
 are writing LATTIE


After reading this letter Richard Kenton tore it into small pieces so
that there should not be even so much witness as it bore to facts that
seemed to fill him with fury to the throat His fury was in agreement
with his temperament the white kind and cold kind He was able to keep
it to himself for that reason at supper his wife knew merely that
he had something on his mind that he did not wish to talk of and
experience had taught her that it would be useless to try making him
speak

He slept upon his wrath and in the morning early at an hour when he
knew there would be no loafers in the place he went to an outdated
saddlers shop and asked the owner a veteran of his fathers regiment
Welks do you happen to have a cowhide among your antiquities

Regular old style Welks returned Kind they make out of a cows hide
and use on a mans

Something of that sort said Richard with a slight smile

The saddler said nothing more but rummaged among the riffraff on an
upper shelf He got down with the tapering translucent wickedlooking
thing in his hand I reckon thats what youre after squire

Reckon it is Welks said Richard drawing it through his tubed left
hand Then he buttoned it under his coat and paid the quarter which
Welks said had always been the price of a cowhide even since he could
remember and walked away towards the station

Hows the old colonel Welks called after him having forgotten to ask
before

The colonels all right Richard called back without looking round

He walked up and down in front of the station A local train came in
from Ballardsville at 815 and waited for the New York special and
then returned to Ballardsville Richard had bought a ticket for that
station and was going to take the train back but among the passengers
who descended from it when it drew in was one who saved him the trouble
of going

Bittridge with his overcoat hanging on his arm advanced towards him
with the rest and continued to advance in a sort of fascination after
his neighbors with the instinct that something was about to happen
parted on either side of Richard and left the two men confronted
Richard did not speak but deliberately reached out his left hand which
he caught securely into Bittridges collar then he began to beat him
with the cowhide wherever he could strike his writhing and twisting
shape Neither uttered a word and except for the whir of the cowhide in
the air and the rasping sound of its arrest upon the body of Bittridge
the thing was done in perfect silence The witnesses stood well back in
a daze from which they recovered when Richard released Bittridge with
a twist of the hand that tore his collar loose and left his cravat
dangling and tossed the frayed cowhide away and turned and walked
homeward Then one of them picked up Bittridges hat and set it aslant
on his head and others helped pull his collar together and tie his
cravat

For the few moments that Richard Kenton remained in sight they scarcely
found words coherent enough for question and when they did Bittridge
had nothing but confused answers to give to the effect that he did not
know what it meant but he would find out He got into a hack and had
himself driven to his hotel but he never made the inquiry which he
threatened

In his own house Richard Kenton lay down awhile deadly sick and
his wife had to bring him brandy before he could control his nerves
sufficiently to speak Then he told her what he had done and why and
Mary pulled off his shoes and put a hotwater bottle to his cold feet
It was not exactly the treatment for a champion but Mary Kenton was not
thinking of that and when Richard said he still felt a little sick at
the stomach she wanted him to try a drop of camphor in addition to the
brandy She said he must not talk but she wished him so much to talk
that she was glad when he began

It seemed to be something I had to do Mary but I would give anything
if I had not been obliged to do it

Yes I know just how you feel Dick and I think its pretty hard this
has come on you I do think Ellen might

It wasnt her fault Mary You mustnt blame her Shes had more to
bear than all the rest of us Mary looked stubbornly unconvinced and
she was not moved apparently by what he went on to say The thing now
is to keep what Ive done from making more mischief for her

What do you mean Dick You dont believe hell do anything about it
do you

No Im not afraid of that His mouth is shut But you cant tell how
Ellen will take it She may side with him now

Dick If I thought Ellen Kenton could be such a fool as that

If shes in love with him shell take his part

But she cant be in love with him when she knows how he acted to your
father

We cant be sure of that I know how he acted to father but at this
minute I pity him so that I could take his part against father And I
can understand how EllenAnyway I must make a clean breast of it What
day is this Thursday And they sail Saturday I must write

He lifted himself on his elbow and made as if to throw off the shawl
she had spread upon him

No no I will write Dick I will write to your mother What shall
I say She whirled about and got the paper and ink out of her
writingdesk and sat down near him to keep him from getting up and
wrote the date and the address Dear Mother Kenton which was the way
she always began her letters to Mrs Kenton in order to distinguish her
from her own mother Now what shall I say

Simply this answered Richard That I knew of what had happened in
New York and when I met him this morning I cowhided him Ugh

Well that wont do Dick Youve got to tell all about it Your mother
wont understand

Then you write what you please and read it to me It makes me sick to
think of it Richard closed his eyes and Mary wrote

 DEAR MOTHER KENTONI am sitting by Richard writing at his
 request about what he has done He received a letter from New York
 telling him of the Bittridges performances there and how that
 wretch had insulted and abused you all He bought a cowhide
 meaning to go over to Ballardsville and use it on him there but B
 came over on the Accommodation this morning and Richard met him at
 the station He did not attempt to resist for Richard took him
 quite by surprise Now Mother Kenton you know that Richard
 doesnt approve of violence and the dear sweet soul is perfectly
 brokendown by what he had to do But he had to do it and he
 wishes you to know at once that he did it He dreads the effect
 upon Ellen and we must leave it to your judgment about telling her
 Of course sooner or later she must find it out You need not be
 alarmed about Richard He is just nauseated a little and he will
 be all right as soon as his stomach is settled He thinks you ought
 to have this letter before you sail and with affectionate goodbyes
 to all in which Dick joins

 Your loving daughter

 Mary KENTON

There Will that do

Yes that is everything that can be said answered Richard and Mary
kissed him gratefully before sealing her letter

I will put a special delivery on it she said and her precaution
availed to have the letter delivered to Mrs Kenton the evening the
family left the hotel when it was too late to make any change in their
plans but in time to give her a bad night on the steamer in her doubt
whether she ought to let the family go with this trouble behind them

But she would have had a bad night on the steamer in any case with the
heat and noise and smell of the docks and the steamer sailed with her
at six oclock the next morning with the doubt still open in her mind
The judge had not been of the least use to her in helping solve it and
she had not been able to bring herself to attack Lottie for writing to
Richard She knew it was Lottie who had made the mischief but she could
not be sure that it was mischief till she knew its effect upon Ellen
The girl had been carried in the arms of one of the stewards from the
carriage to her berth in Lotties room and there she had lain through
the night speechless and sleepless




IX

Ellen did not move or manifest any consciousness when the steamer left
her dock and moved out into the stream or take any note of the tumult
that always attends a great liners departure At breakfasttime her
mother came to her from one of the brief absences she made in the hope
that at each turn she should find her in a different mood and asked if
she would not have something to eat

Im not hungry she answered When will it sail

Why Ellen We sailed two hours ago and the pilot has just left us

Ellen lifted herself on her elbow and stared at her And you let me
she said cruelly

Ellen I will not have this cried her mother frantic at the
reproach What do you mean by my letting you You knew that we were
going to sail didnt you What else did you suppose we had come to the
steamer for

I supposed you would let me stay if I wanted to But go away momma
go away Youre all against meyou and poppa and Lottie and Boyne
Oh dear oh dear She threw herself down in her berth and covered her
face with the sheet sobbing while her mother stood by in an anguish of
pity and anger She wanted to beat the girl she wanted to throw herself
upon her and weep with her in the misery which she shared with her

Lottie came to the door of the stateroom with an armload of
longstemmed roses the gift of the young Mr Plumpton who had not had
so much to be entreated to come down to the steamer and see her off as
Boyne had pretended Momma she said I have got to leave these roses
in here whether Ellen likes it or not Boyne wont have them in his
room because he says the man thats with him would have a right to
object and this is half my room anyway

Mrs Kenton frowned and shook her head but Ellen answered from under
the sheet I dont mind the roses Lottie I wish youd stay with me a
little while

Lottie hesitated having in mind the breakfast for which the horn
had just sounded But apparently she felt that one good turn deserved
another and she answered All right I will Nell Momma you tell
Boyne to hurry and come to Ellen as soon as hes done and then I will
go Dont let anybody take my place

I wish said Ellen still from under the sheet that momma would have
your breakfast sent here I dont want Boyne

Women apparently do not require any explanation of these swift
vicissitudes in one another each knowing probably in herself the nerves
from which they proceed Mrs Kenton promptly assented in spite of the
sulky reluctance which Lotties blue eyes looked at her she motioned
her violently to silence and said Yes I will Ellen I will send
breakfast for both of you

When she was gone Ellen uncovered her face and asked Lottie to dip a
towel in water and give it to her As she bathed her eyes she said You
dont care do you Lottie

Not very much said Lottie unsparingly I can go to lunch I
suppose

Maybe Ill go to lunch with you Ellen suggested as if she were
speaking of some one else

Lottie wasted neither sympathy nor surprise on the question Well
maybe that would be the best thing Why dont you come to breakfast

No I wont go to breakfast But you go

When Lottie joined her family in the diningsaloon she carelessly
explained that Ellen had said she wanted to be alone Before the young
man who was the only other person besides the Kentons at their table
her mother could not question her with any hope that the bad would not
be made worse and so she remained silent Judge Kenton sat with his
eyes fixed on his plate where as yet the steward had put no breakfast
for him Boyne was supporting the dignity of the family in one of those
moments of majesty from which he was so apt to lapse into childish
dependence Lottie offered him another alternative by absently laying
hold of his napkin on the table

Thats mine he said with husky gloom

She tossed it back to him with prompt disdain and a deeply eyelashed
glance at a napkin on her right The young man who sat next it said
with a smile Perhaps thats yoursunless Ive taken my neighbors

Lottie gave him a stare and when she had sufficiently punished him for
his temerity said rather sweetly Oh thank you and took the napkin

I hope we shall all have use for them before long the young man
ventured again

Well I should think as much returned the girl and this was the
beginning of a conversation which the young man shared successively with
the judge and Mrs Kenton as opportunity offered He gave the judge his
card across the table and when the judge had read on it Rev Hugh
Breckon he said that his name was Kenton and he introduced the young
man formally to his family Mr Breckon had a cleanshaven face with an
habitual smile curving into the cheeks from under a long straight nose
his chin had a slight whopperjaw twist that was charming his gay eyes
were blue and a full vein came down his forehead between them from his
smooth hair When he laughed which was often his color brightened

Boyne was named last and then Mr Breckon said with a smile that
showed all his white teeth Oh yes Mr Boyne and I are friends
alreadyever since we found ourselves roommates and but for us as
Lottie afterwards noted they might never have known Boyne was rooming
with him and could easily have made all sorts of insulting remarks
about Mr Breckon in their ignorance

The possibility seemed to delight Mr Breckon he invited her to make
all the insulting remarks she could think of any way and professed
himself a loser so far as her real opinion was withheld from him by
reason of his rashness in giving the facts away In the electrical
progress of their acquaintance she had begun walking up and down the
promenade with him after they came up from breakfast her mother had
gone to Ellen the judge had been made comfortable in his steamerchair
and Boyne had been sent about his business

I will try to think some up she promised him as soon as I HAVE
any real opinion of you and he asked her if he might consider that a
beginning

She looked at him out of her indomitable blue eyes and said If it
hadnt been for your card and the Reverend on it I should have said
you were an actor

Well well said Mr Breckon with a laugh perhaps I am in a way
I oughtnt to be of course but if a minister ever forces himself I
suppose hes acting

I dont see said Lottie instantly availing herself of the opening
how you can get up and pray Sunday after Sunday whether you feel like
it or not

The young man said with another laugh but not so gay Well the case
has its difficulties

Or perhaps you just read prayers Lottie sharply conjectured

No he returned I havent that advantageif you think it one Im a
sort of a Unitarian Very advanced too Im afraid

Is that a kind of Universalist

Notnot exactly Theres an old jokeIm not sure its very
goodwhich distinguishes between the sects Its said that the
Universalists think God is too good to damn them and the Unitarians
think they are too good to be damned Lottie shrank a little from him
Ah he cried you think it sounds wicked Well Im sorry Im not
clerical enough to joke about serious things

He looked into her face with a pretended anxiety Oh I dont know
she said with a little scorn I guess if you can stand it I can

Im not sure that I can Im afraid its more in keeping with an
actors profession than my own Why he added as if to make a
diversion should you have thought I was an actor

I suppose because you were cleanshaved and your pronunciation So
Englishy

Is it Perhaps I ought to be proud But Im not an Englishman I am a
plain republican American May I ask if you are English

Oh said Lottie As if you thought such a thing Were from Ohio

Mr Breckon said Ah Lottie could not make out in just what sense

By this time they were leaning on the rail of the promenade looking
over at what little was left of Long Island and she said abruptly I
think I will go and see how my father is getting along

Oh do take me with you Miss Kenton Mr Breckon entreated I am
feeling very badly about that poor old joke I know you dont think well
of me for it and I wish to report what Ive been saying to your father
and let him judge me Ive heard that its hard to live up to Ohio
people when youre at your best and I do hope youll believe I have not
been quite at my best Will you let me come with you

Lottie did not know whether he was making fun of her or not but she
said Oh its a free country and allowed him to go with her

His preface made the judge look rather grave but when he came to the
joke Kenton laughed and said it was not bad

Oh but that isnt quite the point said Mr Breckon The question
is whether I am good in repeating it to a young lady who was seeking
serious instruction on a point of theology

I dont know what she would have done with the instruction if she
had got it said the judge dryly and the young man ventured in her
behalf

It would be difficult for any one to manage perhaps

Perhaps Kenton assented and Lottie could see that he was thinking
Ellen would know what to do with it

She resented that and she was in the offence that girls feel when
their elders make them the subject of comment with their contemporaries
Well Ill leave you to discuss it alone Im going to Ellen she
said the young man vainly following her a few paces with apologetic
gurgles of laughter

Thats right her father consented and then he seized the opening to
speak about Ellen My eldest daughter is something of an invalid but
I hope we shall have her on deck before the voyage is over She is more
interested in those matters than her sister

Oh Mr Breckon interpolated in a note of sympathetic interest He
could not well do more

It was enough for Judge Kenton who launched himself upon the
celebration of Ellens gifts and qualities with a simplehearted
eagerness which he afterwards denied when his wife accused him of it
but justified as wholly safe in view of Mr Breckons calling and his
obvious delicacy of mind It was something that such a person would
understand and Kenton was sure that he had not unduly praised the
girl A less besotted parent might have suspected that he had not deeply
interested his listener who seemed glad of the diversion operated by
Boynes coming to growl upon his father Mothers bringing Ellen up

Oh then I mustnt keep your chair said the minister and he rose
promptly from the place he had taken beside the judge and got himself
away to the other side of the ship before the judge could frame a
fitting request for him to stay

If you had Mrs Kenton declared when he regretted this to her I
dont know what I would have done Its bad enough for him to hear you
bragging about the child without being kept to help take care of her
or keep her amused as you call it I will see that Ellen is kept amused
without calling upon strangers She intimated that if Kenton did not
act with more selfrestraint she should do little less than take Ellen
ashore and abandon him to the voyage alone Under the intimidation he
promised not to speak of Ellen again

At luncheon where Mr Breckon again devoted himself to Lottie he and
Ellen vied in ignoring each other after their introduction as far as
words went The girl smiled once or twice at what he was saying to her
sister and his glance kindled when it detected her smile He might be
supposed to spare her his conversation in her own interest she looked
so little able to cope with the exigencies of the talk he kept going

When he addressed her she answered as if she had not been listening and
he turned back to Lottie After luncheon he walked with her and their
acquaintance made such a swift advance that she was able to ask him if
he laughed that way with everybody

He laughed and then he begged her pardon if he had been rude

Well I dont see what there is to laugh at so much When you ask me
a thing I tell you just what I think and it seems to set you off in a
perfect gale Dont you expect people to say what they think

I think its beautiful said the young man going into the gale and
Ive got to expecting it of you at any rate Butbut its always so
surprising It isnt what you expect of people generally is it

I dont expect it of you said Lottie

No asked Mr Breckon in another gale Am I so uncandid

I dont know about uncandid But I should say you were slippery

At this extraordinary criticism the young man looked graver than he had
yet been able to do since the beginning of their acquaintance He said
presently I wish you would explain what you mean by slippery

Youre as close as a trap

Really

It makes me tired

If youre not too tired now I wish you would say how

Oh you understand well enough Youve got me to say what I think about
all sorts of things and you havent expressed your opinion on a single
solitary point

Lottie looked fiercely out to sea turning her face so as to keep him
from peering around into it in the way he had For that reason perhaps
he did not try to do so He answered seriously I believe you are
partly right Im afraid I havent seemed quite fair Couldnt you
attribute my closeness to something besides my slipperiness He began
to laugh again Cant you imagine my being interested in your opinions
so much more than my own that I didnt care to express mine

Lottie said impatiently Oh pshaw She had hesitated whether to say
Rats

But now he pursued if you will suggest some point on which I can
give you an opinion I promise solemnly to do so but he was not very
solemn as he spoke

Well then I will she said Dont you think its very strange to
say the least for a minister to be always laughing so much

Mr Breckon gave a peal of delight and answered Yes I certainly do
He controlled himself so far as to say Now I think Ive been pretty
open with you and I wish youd answer me a question Will you

Well I willone said Lottie

It may be two or three but Ill begin with one Why do you think a
minister ought to be more serious than other men

Why Well I should think youd know You wouldnt laugh at a funeral
would you

Ive been at some funerals where it would have been a relief to laugh
and Ive wanted to cry at some weddings But you think it wouldnt do

Of course it wouldnt I should think youd know as much as that said
Lottie out of patience with him

But a minister isnt always marrying or burying people and in the
intervals why shouldnt he be setting them an example of harmless
cheerfulness

He ought to be thinking more about the other world I should say

Well if he believes there is another world

Why Dont you she broke out on him

Mr Breckon ruled himself and continuedas strenuously and
unquestionably as he ought he has greater reason than other men for
gayety through his faith in a happier state of being than this Thats
one of the reasons I use against myself when I think of leaving off
laughing Now Miss Kenton he concluded for such a close and
slippery nature I think Ive been pretty frank and he looked round
and down into her face with a burst of laughter that could be heard
an the other side of the ship He refused to take up any serious topic
after that and he returned to his former amusement of making her give
herself away

That night Lottie came to her room with an expression so decisive in her
face that Ellen following it with vague dark eyes as it showed itself
in the glass at which her sister stood taking out the first dismantling
hairpins before going to bed could not fail of something portentous in
it

Well said Lottie with severe finality I havent got any use
for THAT young man from this time out Of all the tiresome people he
certainly takes the cake You can have him Ellen if you want him

Whats the matter with him asked Ellen with a voice in sympathy with
the slow movement of her large eyes as she lay in her berth staring at
Lottie

Theres everything the matter that oughtnt to be Hes too trivial
for anything I like a man thats serious about one thing in the
universe at least and thats just what Mr Breckon isnt She went at
such length into his disabilities that by the time she returned to the
climax with which she started she was ready to clamber into the upper
berth and as she snapped the electric button at its head she repeated
Hes trivial

Isnt it getting rough asked Ellen The ship seems to be tipping

Yes it is said Lottie crossly Goodnight

If the Rev Mr Breckon was making an early breakfast in the hope of
sooner meeting Lottie who had dismissed him the night before without
encouraging him to believe that she wished ever to see him again he
was destined to disappointment The deputation sent to breakfast by
the paradoxical family whose acquaintance he had made on terms of each
forbidding intimacy did not include the girl who had frankly provoked
his confidence and severely snubbed it He had left her brother very
seasick in their stateroom and her mother was reported by her father
to be feeling the motion too much to venture out The judge was in
fact the only person at table when Breckon sat down but when he had
accounted for his wifes absence and confessed that he did not believe
either of his daughters was coming Ellen gainsaid him by appearing and
advancing quite steadily along the saloon to the place beside him It
had not gone so far as this in the judges experience of a neurotic
invalid without his learning to ask her no questions about herself He
had always a hard task in refraining but he had grown able to refrain
and now he merely looked unobtrusively glad to see her and asked her
where Lottie was

Oh she doesnt want any breakfast she says Is momma sick too
Wheres Boyne

The judge reported as to her mother and Mr Breckon after the exchange
of a silent salutation with the girl had a gleeful moment in describing
Boynes revolt at the stewards notion of gruel Im glad to see you so
well Miss Kenton he concluded

I suppose I will be sick too if it gets rougher she said and she
turned from him to give a rather compendious order to the table steward

Well youve got an appetite Ellen her father ventured

I dont believe I will eat anything she checked him with a falling
face

Breckon came to the aid of the judge If youre not sick now I
prophesy you wont be Miss Kenton It cant get much rougher without
doing something uncommon

Is it a storm she asked indifferently

Its what they call half a gale I believe I dont know how they
measure it

She smiled warily in response to his laugh and said to her father Are
you going up after breakfast poppa

Why if you want to go Ellen

Oh I wasnt asking for that I am going back to Lottie But I should
think you would like the air Wont it do you good

Im all right said the judge cheered by her show of concern for some
one else I suppose its rather wet on deck he referred himself to
Breckon

Well not very if you keep to the leeward She doesnt seem a very wet
boat

What is a wet boat Ellen asked without lifting her sad eyes

Well really Im afraid its largely a superstition Passengers like
to believe that some boats are less liable to ship seasto run into
wavesthan others but I fancy thats to give themselves the air of old
travellers

She let the matter lapse so entirely that he supposed she had forgotten
it in all its bearings when she asked Have you been across many
times

Not manyfour or five

This is our first time she volunteered

I hope it wont be your last I know you will enjoy it She fell
listless again and Breckon imagined he had made a break Not he
added with an endeavor for lightness that I suppose youre going for
pleasure altogether Women nowadays are above that I understand They
go abroad for arts sake and to study political economy and history
and literature

My daughter the judge interposed will not do much in that way I
hope

The girl bent her head over her plate and frowned

Oh then said Breckon I will believe that shes going for purely
selfish enjoyment I should like to be justified in making that my
object by a good example

Ellen looked up and gave him a look that cut him short in his glad note
The lifting of her eyelids was like the rise of the curtain upon some
scene of tragedy which was all the more impressive because it seemed
somehow mixed with shame This poor girl whom he had pitied as an
invalid was a sufferer from some spiritual blight more pathetic than
broken health He pulled his mind away from the conjecture that tempted
it and went on One of the advantages of going over the fourth or fifth
time is that youre relieved from a discoverers duties to Europe Ive
got absolutely nothing before me now but at first I had to examine
every object of interest on the Continent and form an opinion about
thousands of objects that had no interest for me I hope Miss Kenton
will take warning from me

He had not addressed Ellen directly and her father answered We have
no definite plans as yet but we dont mean to overwork ourselves even
if weve come for a rest I dont know he added but we had better
spend our summer in England Its easier getting about where you know
the language

The judge seemed to refer his ideas to Breckon for criticism and the
young man felt authorized to say Oh so many of them know the language
everywhere now that its easy getting about in any country

Yes I suppose so the judge vaguely deferred

Which Ellen demanded of the young man with a nervous suddenness do
you think is the most interesting country

He found himself answering with equal promptness Oh Italy of
course

Can we go to Italy poppa asked the girl

I shouldnt advise you to go there at once Breckon intervened
smiling Youd find it Pretty hot there now Florence or Rome or
Naplesyou cant think of them

We have it pretty hot in Central Ohio said the judge with latent
pride in his home climate What sort of place is Holland

Oh delightful And the boat goes right on to Rotterdam you know

Yes We had arranged to leave it at Boulogne but we could change
Do you think your mother would like Holland The judge turned to his
daughter

I think she would like Italy better Shes read more about it said
the girl

Rise of the Dutch Republic her father suggested

Yes I know But shes read more about Italy

Oh well Breckon yielded the Italian lakes wouldnt be impossible
And you might find Venice fairly comfortable

We could go to Italy then said the judge to his daughter if your
mother prefers

Breckon found the simplicity of this charming and he tasted a yet finer
pleasure in the duplicity for he divined that the father was seeking
only to let his daughter have her way in pretending to yield to her
mothers preference

It was plain that the familys life centred as it ought about this
sad sick girl the heart of whose mystery he perceived on reflection
he had not the wish to pluck out He might come to know it but he would
not try to know it if it offered itself he might even try not to know
it He had sometimes found it more helpful with trouble to be ignorant
of its cause

In the mean time he had seen that these Kentons were sweet good
people as he phrased their quality to himself He had come to terms of
impersonal confidence the night before with Boyne who had consulted
him upon many more problems and predicaments of life than could have yet
beset any boys experience probably with the wish to make provision for
any possible contingency of the future The admirable principles which
Boyne evolved for his guidance from their conversation were formulated
with a gravity which Breckon could outwardly respect only by stifling
his laughter in his pillow He rather liked the way Lottie had tried to
weigh him in her balance and found him as it were of an imponderable
levity With his sense of being really very light at most times and
with most people he was aware of having been particularly light with
Lottie of having been slippery of having so far as responding to her
frankness was concerned been close He relished the unsparing honesty
with which she had denounced him and though he did not yet know his
outcast condition with relation to her he could not think of her
without a smile of wholly disinterested liking He did not know as a
man of earlier date would have known all that the little button in the
judges lapel meant but he knew that it meant service in the civil war
a struggle which he vaguely and impersonally revered though its details
were of much the same dimness for him as those of the Revolution and
the War of 1812 The modest distrust which had grown upon the bold
selfconfidence of Kentons earlier manhood could not have been more
tenderly and reverently imagined and Breckons conjecture of things
suffered for loves sake against sense and conviction in him were his
further tribute to a character which existed of course mainly in this
conjecture It appeared to him that Kenton was held not only in the
subjection to his wifes judgment which befalls and doubtless
becomes a man after many years of marriage but that he was in the
actual performance of more than common renunciation of his judgment in
deference to the good woman She in turn to be sure offered herself a
sacrifice to the whims of the sick girl whose worst whim was having
no wish that could be ascertained and who now after two days of her
mothers devotion was cast upon her own resources by the inconstant
barometer It had become apparent that Miss Kenton was her fathers
favorite in a special sense and that his partial affection for her
was of much older date than her mothers Not less charming than her
fondness for her father was the openness with which she disabled his
wisdom because of his partiality to her




X

When they left the breakfast table the first morning of the rough
weather Breckon offered to go on deck with Miss Kenton and put her
where she could see the waves That had been her shapeless ambition
dreamily expressed with reference to some time as they rose Breckon
asked Why not now and he promised to place her chair on deck where
she could enjoy the spectacle safe from any seas the boat might ship
Then she recoiled and she recoiled the further upon her fathers
urgence At the foot of the gangway she looked wistfully up the reeling
stairs and said that she saw her shawl and Lotties among the others
solemnly swaying from the top railing Oh then Breckon pressed her
you could be made comfortable without the least trouble

I ought to go and see how Lottie is getting along she murmured

Her father said he would see for her and on this she explicitly
renounced her ambition of going up You couldnt do anything she
said coldly

If Miss Lottie is very seasick shes beyond all earthly aid Breckon
ventured Shed better be left to the vain ministrations of the
stewardess

Ellen looked at him in apparent distrust of his piety if not of his
wisdom I dont believe I could get up the stairs she said

Well he admitted theyre not as steady as landgoing stairs Her
father discreetly kept silence and as no one offered to help her she
began to climb the crazy steps with Breckon close behind her in latent
readiness for her fall

From the top she called down to the judge Tell momma I will only stay
a minute But later tucked into her chair on the lee of the bulkhead
with Breckon bracing himself against it beside her she showed no
impatience to return Are they never higher than that she required
of him with her wan eyes critically on the infinite procession of the
surges

They must be Breckon answered if theres any truth in common
report Ive heard of their running mountains high Perhaps they used
rather low mountains to measure them by Or the measurements may
not have been very exact But common report never leaves much to the
imagination

That was the way at Niagara the girl assented and Breckon obligingly
regretted that he had never been there He thought it in good taste that
she should not tell him he ought to go She merely said I was there
once with poppa and did not press her advantage Do they think she
asked that its going to be a very long voyage

I havent been to the smokingroomthats where most of the thinking
is done on such points the ships officers never seem to know about
itsince the weather changed Should you mind it greatly

I wouldnt care if it never ended said the girl with such a note of
dire sincerity that Breckon instantly changed his first mind as to her
words implying a pose She took any deeper implication from them in
adding I didnt know I should like being at sea

Well if youre not seasick he assented there are not many
pleasanter things in life

She suggested I suppose Im not well enough to be seasick Then she
seemed to become aware of something provisional in his attendance and
she said You mustnt stay on my account I can get down when I want
to

Do let me stay he entreated unless youd really rather not and
as there was no chair immediately attainable he crouched on the deck
beside hers

It makes me think she said and he perceived that she meant the sea
of the coldwhite heavy plunging foam in The Dream of Fair Women
The words always seemed drenched

Ah Tennyson yes said Breckon with a disposition to smile at the
simpleheartedness of the literary allusion Do young ladies read
poetry much in Ohio

I dont believe they do she answered Do they anywhere

Thats one of the things I should like to know Is Tennyson your
favorite poet

I dont believe I have any said Ellen I used to like Whither and
Emerson aid Longfellow too

Used to Dont you now

I dont read them so much now and she made a pause behind which he
fancied her secret lurked But he shrank from knowing it if he might

Youre all great readers in your family he suggested as a polite
diversion

Lottie isnt she answered dreamily She hates it

Ah I referred more particularly to the others said Breckon and
he began to laugh and then checked himself Your mother and the
judgeand your brother

Boyne reads about insects she admitted

He told me of his collection of cocoons He seems to be afraid it has
suffered in his absence

Im afraid it has said Ellen and then remained silent

There the young man broke out pointing seaward Thats rather a
fine one Doesnt that realize your idea of something mountains high
Unless your mountains are very high in Ohio

It is grand And the gulf between But we havent any in our part Its
all level Do you believe the tenth wave is larger than the rest

Why the difficulty is to know which the tenth wave is or when to
begin counting

Yes said the girl and she added vaguely I suppose its like
everything else in that We have to makebelieve before we can believe
anything

Something like an hypothesis certainly seems necessary Breckon
assented with a smile for the gravity of their discourse We shouldnt
have the atomic theory without it She did not say anything and he
decided that the atomic theory was beyond the range of her reading He
tried to be more concrete We have to makebelieve in ourselves before
we can believe dont we And then we sometimes find we are wrong He
laughed but she asked with tragical seriousness

And what ought you to do when you find out you are mistaken in
yourself

Thats what Im trying to decide he replied Sometimes I feel like
renouncing myself altogether but usually I give myself another chance
I dare say if I hadnt been so forbearing I might have agreed with your
sister about my unfitness for the ministry

With Lottie

She thinks I laugh too much

I dont see why a minister shouldnt laugh if he feels like it And if
theres something to laugh at

Ah thats just the point Is there ever anything to laugh at If we
looked closely enough at things oughtnt we rather to cry He laughed
in retreat from the serious proposition But it wouldnt do to try
making each other cry instead of laugh would it I suppose your sister
would rather have me cry

I dont believe Lottie thought much about it said Ellen and at this
point Mr Breckon yielded to an impulse

I should think I had really been of some use if I had made you laugh
Miss Kenton

Me

You look as if you laughed with your whole heart when you did laugh

She glanced about and Breckon decided that she had found him too
personal I wonder if I could walk with the ship tipping so she
asked

Well not far said Breckon with a provisional smile and then he was
frightened from his irony by her flinging aside her wraps and starting
to her feet Before he could scramble to his own she had slid down
the reeling promenade half to the guard over which she seemed about to
plunge He hurled himself after her he could not have done otherwise
and it was as much in a wild clutch for support as in a purpose to save
her that he caught her in his arms and braced himself against the ships
slant Where are you going What are you trying to do he shouted

I wanted to go downstairs she protested clinging to him

You were nearer going overboard he retorted You shouldnt have
tried He had not fully formulated his reproach when the ship righted
herself with a counterroll and plunge and they were swung staggering
back together against the bulkhead The door of the gangway was within
reach and Breckon laid hold of the rail beside it and put the girl
within Are you hurt he asked

No no Im not hurt she panted sinking on the cushioned benching
where usually rows of semiseasick people were lying

I thought you might have been bruised against the bulkhead he said
Are you sure youre not hurt that I cant get you anything From the
steward I mean

Only help me downstairs she answered Im perfectly well and
Breckon was so willing on these terms to close the incident that he was
not aware of the bruise on his own arm which afterwards declared itself
in several primitive colors Dont tell them she added I want to
come up again

Why certainly not he consented but Boyne Kenton who had been an
involuntary witness of the fact from a point on the forward promenade
where he had stationed himself to study the habits of the stormy petrel
at a moment so favorable to the acquaintance of the petrel having
left a seasick bed for the purpose was of another mind He had been
alarmed and as it appeared in the private interview which he demanded
of his mother he had been scandalized

It is bad enough the way Lottie is always going on with fellows And
now if Ellen is going to begin

But Boyne child Mrs Kenton argued in an equilibrium between the
wish to laugh at her son and the wish to box his ears how could she
help his catching her if he was to save her from pitching overboard

Thats just it He will always think that she did it just so he would
have to catch her

I dont believe any one would think that of Ellen said Mrs Kenton
gravely

Momma You dont know what these Eastern fellows are There are so few
of them that theyre used to having girls throw themselves at them and
they will think anything ministers and all You ought to talk to Ellen
and caution her Of course she isnt like Lottie but if Lotties
been behaving her way with Mr Breckon he must suppose the rest of the
family is like her

Boyne said his mother provisionally what sort of person is Mr
Breckon

Well I think hes kind of frivolous

Do you Boyne

I dont suppose he means any harm by it but I dont like to see a
minister laugh so much I cant hardly get him to talk seriously about
anything And I just know he makes fun of Lottie I dont mean that he
always makes fun with me He didnt that night at the vaudeville where
I first saw him

What do you mean

Dont you remember I told you about it last winter

And was Mr Breckon that gentleman

Yes but he didnt know who I was when we met here

Well upon my word Boyne I think you might have told us before said
his mother in not very definite vexation Go along now

Boyne stood talking to his mother with his hands which he had not
grown to largely planted on the jambs of her stateroom door She was
keeping her berth not so much because she was seasick as because it
was the safest place in the unsteady ship to be in Do you want me to
send Ellen to you

I will attend to Ellen Boyne his mother snubbed him How is
Lottie

I cant tell whether shes sick or not I went to see about her and she
motioned me away and fairly screamed when I told her she ought to keep
out in the air Well I must be going up again myself or

Before lunch Boyne had experienced the alternative which he did not
express although his theory and practice of keeping in the open air
ought to have rendered him immune Breckon saw his shock of hair and
his large eyes like Ellens in their present gloom looking out of it
on the pillow of the upper berth when he went to their room to freshen
himself for the luncheon and found Boyne averse even to serious
conversation He went to lunch without him None of the Kentons were at
table and he had made up his mind to lunch alone when Ellen appeared
and came wavering down the aisle to the table He stood up to help her
but seeing how securely she stayed herself from chair to chair he sank
down again

Poppy is sick too now she replied as if to account for being
alone

And youre none the worse for your little promenade The steward came
to Breckons left shoulder with a dish and after an effort to serve
himself from it he said with a slight gasp The other side please
Ellen looked at him but did not speak and he made haste to say The
doctor goes so far as to admit that its half a gale I dont know just
what measure the first officer would have for it But I congratulate you
on a very typical little storm Miss Kenton perfectly safe but very
decided A great many people cross the Atlantic without anything half
as satisfactory There is either too much or too little of this sort
of thing He went on talking about the weather and had got such a
distance from the point of beginning that he had cause to repent being
brought back to it when she asked

Did the doctor think you were hurt

Well perhaps I ought to be more ashamed than I am said Breckon But
I thought I had better make sure And its only a bruise

Wont you let ME help you she asked as another dish intervened at
his right I hurt you

Breckon laughed at her solemn face and voice If youll exonerate
yourself first he answered I couldnt touch a morsel that conveyed
confession of the least culpability on your part Do you consent
Otherwise I pass this dish And really I want some

Well she sadly consented and he allowed her to serve his plate

More yet please he said A lot

Is that enough

Well for the first helping And dont offer to cut it up for me My
proud spirit draws the line at cutting up Besides a fork will do the
work with goulash

Is that what it is she asked but not apparently because she cared to
know

Unless you prefer to naturalize it as stew It seems to have come in
with the Hungarian bands I suppose you have them in

Tuskingum No it is too small But I heard them at a restaurant in New
York where my brother took us

In the spirit of scientific investigation Its strange how a common
principle seems to pervade both the Hungarian music and cookingthe
same wandering airs and flavorswild vague lawless harmonies in both
Did you notice it

Ellen shook her head The look of gloom which seemed to Breckon habitual
in it came back into her face and he had a fantastic temptation to
see how far he could go with her sad consciousness before she should
be aware that he was experimenting upon it He put this temptation from
him and was in the enjoyment of a comfortable selfrighteousness when
it returned in twofold power upon him with the coming of some cutlets
which capriciously varied the repast

Ah now Miss Kenton if you were to take pity on my helplessness

Why certainly She possessed herself of his plate and began to cut
up the meat for him Am I making the bites too small she asked with
an upward glance at him

Well I dont know Should you think so he returned with a smile
that outmeasured the morsels on the plate before her

She met his laughing eyes with eyes that questioned his honesty at
first sadly and then indignantly She dropped the knife and fork upon
the plate and rose

Oh Miss Kenton he penitently entreated

But she was down the slanting aisle and out of the reeling door before
he could decide what to do




XI

It seemed to Breckon that he had passed through one of those accessions
of temperament one of those crises of natural man to put it in the
terms of an older theology than he professed that might justify him in
recurring to his original sense of his unfitness for his sacred calling
as he would hardly ham called it He had allowed his levity to get the
better of his sympathy and his love of teasing to overpower that love
of helping which seemed to him his chief right and reason for being a
minister To play a sort of poor practical joke upon that melancholy
girl who was also so attractive was not merely unbecoming to him as
a minister it was cruel it was vulgar it was ungentlemanly He could
not say less than ungentlemanly for that seemed to give him the only
pang that did him any good Her absolute sincerity had made her such
an easy prey that he ought to have shrunk from the shabby temptation in
abhorrence

It is the privilege of a woman whether she wills it or not to put a
man who is in the wrong concerning her much further in the wrong than he
could be from his offence Breckon did not know whether he was suffering
more or less because he was suffering quite hopelessly but he was sure
that he was suffering justly and he was rather glad if anything that
he must go on suffering His first impulse had been to go at once to
Judge Kenton and own his wrong and take the consequencesin fact
invite them But Breckon forbore for two reasons one that he had
already appeared before the judge with the confession of having possibly
made an unclerical joke to his younger daughter the other that the
judge might not consider levity towards the elder so venial and though
Breckon wished to be both punished and pardoned in the final analysis
perhaps he most wished to be pardoned Without pardon he could see no
way to repair the wrong he had done Perhaps he wished even to retrieve
himself in the girls eyes or wished for the chance of trying

Ellen went away to her stateroom and sat down on the sofa opposite
Lottie and she lost herself in a muse in which she was found by the
voice of the sufferer in the berth

If you havent got anything better to do than come in here and stare
at me I wish you would go somewhere else and stare I can tell you it
isnt any joke

I didnt know I was staring at you said Ellen humbly

It would be enough to have you rising and sinking there without your
staring at all If youre going to stay I wish youd lie down I dont
see why youre so well anyway after getting us all to come on this
wildgoose chase

I know I know Ellen strickenly deprecated But Im not going to
stay I jest came for my things

Is that giggling simpleton sick I hope he is

Mr Breckon Ellen asked though she knew whom Lottie meant No he
isnt sick He was at lunch

Was poppa

He was at breakfast

And momma

She and Boyne are both in bed I dont know whether theyre very sick

Well then Ill just tell you what Ellen Kenton Lottie sat up in
accusal You were staring at something he said and the first thing we
all know it will be another case of Bittridge Ellen winced but Lottie
had no pity You dont know it because you dont know anything and
Im not blaming you but if you let that simpletonI dont care if he
is a ministergo round with you when your family are all sick abed
youll be having the whole ship to look after you

Be still Lottie cried Ellen You are awful and with a flaming
face she escaped from the stateroom

She did not know where else to go and she beat along the sides of the
corridor as far as the diningsaloon She had a dim notion of trying to
go up into the musicroom above but a glance at the reeling steep of
the stairs forbade With her wraps on her arm and her seacap in her
hand she stood clinging to the railpost

Breckon came out of the saloon Oh Miss Kenton he humbly entreated
dont try to go on deck Its rougher than ever

I was going to the musicroom she faltered

Let me help you then he said again They mounted the gangwaysteps
but this time with his hand under her elbow and his arm alert as before
in a suspended embrace against her falling

She had lost the initiative of her earlier adventure she could only
submit herself to his guidance But he almost outdid her in meekness
when he got her safely placed in a corner whence she could not be easily
flung upon the floor You must have found it very stuffy below but
indeed youd better not try going out

Do you think it isnt safe here she asked

Oh yes As long as you keep quiet May I get you something to read
They seem to have a pretty good little library

They both glanced at the case of books from which the stewardlibrarian
was setting them the example of reading a volume

No I dont want to read You musnt let me keep you from it

Well one can read any time But one hasnt always the chance to say
that one is ashamed Dont pretend you dont understand Miss Kenton
I didnt really mean anything The temptation to let you exaggerate my
disability was too much for me Say that you despise me It would be
such a comfort

Werent you hurt

A littlea little more than a little but not half so much as I
deservednot to the point of not being able to cut up my meat Am I
forgiven Ill promise to cut up all your meat for you at dinner Ah
Im making it worse

Oh no Please dont speak of it

Could you forbid my thinking of it too He did not wait for her to
answer Then here goes One two three and the thought is banished
forever Now what shall we speak of or think of We finished up the
weather pretty thoroughly this morning And if you have not the weather
and the ships run when youre at sea why you are at sea Dont you
think it would be a good plan when they stick those little flags into
the chart to show how far weve come in the last twentyfour hours if
theyd supply a topic for the day They might have topics inscribed on
the flagsstandard topics that would serve for any voyage We might
leave port with Historysay personal history that would pave the way
to a general acquaintance among the passengers Then Geography and if
the world is really round and what keeps the sea from spilling Then
Politics and the comparative advantages of monarchical and republican
governments for international discussion Then Pathology and whether
youre usually seasick and if there is any reliable remedy Thenfor
those who are still upPoetry and Fiction whether women really like
Kipling and what kind of novels you prefer There ought to be about
ten topics These boats are sometimes very slow Cant you suggest
something Miss Kenton There is no hurry Weve got four to talk over
for we must bring up the arrears you know And now well begin with
personal history Your sister doesnt approve of me does she

My sister Ellen faltered and between the conscience to own the fact
and the kindness to deny it she stopped altogether

I neednt have asked She told me so herself in almost as many words
She said I was slippery and as close as a trap Miss Kenton I have the
greatest wish to know whether I affect you as both slippery and close

I dont always know what Lottie means

She means what she says and I feel that I am under condemnation till
I reform I dont know how to stop being slippery but Im determined to
stop being close Will you tell her that for me Will you tell her
that you never met an opener franker personof course except
herselfand that so far from being light I seemed to you particularly
heavy Say that I did nothing but talk about myself and that when you
wanted to talk about yourself you couldnt get in a word edgewise Do
try now Miss Kenton and see if you can I dont want you to invent a
character for me quite

Why theres nothing to say about me she began in compliance with his
gayety and then she fell helpless from it

Well then about Tuskingum I should like to hear about Tuskingum so
much

I suppose we like it because weve always lived there You havent been
much in the West have you

Not as much as I hope to be He had found that Western people were
sometimes sensitive concerning their section and were prepared to
resent complacent ignorance of it Ive always thought it must be very
interesting

It isnt said the girl At least not like the East I used to be
provoked when the lecturers said anything like that but when youve
been to New York you see what they mean

The lecturers he queried

They always stayed at our house when they lectured in Tuskingum

Ah Oh yes said Breckon grasping a situation of which he had heard
something chiefly satirical Of course And is your fatheris Judge
Kenton literary Excuse me

Only in his history Hes writing the history of his regiment or he
gets the soldiers to write down all they can remember of the war and
then he puts their stories together

How delightful said Breckon And I suppose its a great pleasure to
him

I dont believe it is said Ellen Poppa doesnt believe in war any
more

Indeed said Breckon That is very interesting

Sometimes when Im helping him with it

Ah I knew you must help him

And he comes to a place where there has been a dreadful slaughter it
seems as if he felt worse about it than I did He isnt sure that it
wasnt all wrong He thinks all war is wrong now

Is hehas he become a follower of Tolstoy

Hes read him He says hes the only man that ever gave a true account
of battles but he had thought it all out for himself before he read
Tolstoy about fighting Do you think it is right to revenge an injury

Why surely not said Breckon rather startled

That is what we say the girl pursued But if some one had injured
youabused your confidence andinsulted you what would you do

Im not sure that I understand Breckon began The inquiry was
superficially impersonal but he reflected that women are never
impersonal or the sons of women for that matter and he suspected an
intimate ground His suspicions were confirmed when Miss Kenton said
It seems easy enough to forgive anything thats done to yourself but
if its done to some one else too have you the rightisnt it wrong
to let it go

You think the question of justice might come in then Perhaps it ought
But what is justice And where does your duty begin to be divided He
saw her following him with alarming intensity and he shrank from the
responsibility before him What application might not she make of his
words in the case whatever it was which he chose not to imagine To
tell you the truth Miss Kenton Im not very clear on that pointIm
not sure that Im disinterested

Disinterested

Yes you know that I abused your confidence at luncheon and until I
know whether the wrong involved any one else He looked at her with
hovering laughter in his eyes which took wing at the reproach in hers
But if we are to be serious

Oh no she said it isnt a serious matter But in the helplessness
of her sincerity she could not carry it off lightly or hide from him
that she was disappointed

He tried to make talk about other things She responded vaguely and
when she had given herself time she said she believed she would go
to Lottie she was quite sure she could get down the stairs alone He
pursued her anxiously politely and at the head of her corridor took
leave of her with a distinct sense of having merited his dismissal

I see what you mean Lottie she said about Mr Breckon

Lottie did not turn her head on the pillow Has it taken you the whole
day to find it out




XII

The father and the mother had witnessed with tempered satisfaction
the interest which seemed to be growing up between Ellen and the young
minister By this time they had learned not to expect too much of any
turn she might take she reverted to a mood as suddenly as she left it
They could not quite make out Breckon himself he was at least as great
a puzzle to them as their own child was

It seems said Mrs Kenton in their first review of the affair after
Boyne had done a brothers duty in trying to bring Ellen under their
mothers censure that he was the gentleman who discussed the theatre
with Boyne at the vaudeville last winter Boyne just casually mentioned
it I was so provoked

I dont see what bearing the fact has the judge remarked

Why Boyne liked him very much that night but now he seems to feel
very much as Lottie does about him He thinks he laughs too much

I dont know that theres much harm in that said the judge And I
shouldnt value Boynes opinion of character very highly

I value any ones intuitionsespecially childrens

Boynes in that middle state where he isnt quite a child And so is
Lottie for that matter

That is true their mother assented And we ought to be glad of
anything that takes Ellens mind off herself If I could only believe
she was forgetting that wretch

Does she ever speak of him

She never hints of him even But her mind may be full of him all the
time

The judge laughed impatiently It strikes me that this young Mr
Breckon hasnt much advantage of Ellen in what Lottie calls closeness

Ellen has always been very reserved It would have been better for her
if she hadnt Oh I scarcely dare to hope anything Rufus I feel that
in everything of this kind we are very ignorant and inexperienced

Inexperienced Renton retorted I dont want any more experience of
the kind Ellen has given us

I dont mean that I meanthis Mr Breckon I cant tell what attracts
him in the child She must appear very crude and uncultivated to him
You neednt resent it so I know shes read a great deal and youve
made her think herself intellectualbut the very simpleheartedness of
the way she would show out her reading would make such a young man see
that she wasnt like the girls he was used to They would hide their
intellectuality if they had any Its no use your trying to fight it
Mr Kenton We are country people and he knows it

Tuskingum isnt country the judge declared

It isnt city And we dont know anything about the world any of us
Oh I suppose we can read and write But we dont know the a b c of
the things he knows He belongs to a kind of societyof peoplein
New York that I had glimpses of in the winter but that I never imagined
before They made me feel very belated and benightedas if I hadnt
read or thought anything They didnt mean to but I couldnt help it
and they couldnt

Youyouve been frightened out of your propriety by what youve seen
in New York said her husband

Ive been frightened certainly And I wish you had been too I wish
you wouldnt be so conceited about Ellen It scares me to see you so
Poor sick thing her looks are all gone You must see that And she
doesnt dress like the girls hes used to I know weve got her things
in New York but she doesnt wear them like a NewYorker I hope she
isnt going in for MORE unhappiness

At the thought of this the judges crest fell Do you believe shes
getting interested in him he asked humbly

No no I dont say that But promise me you wont encourage her in it
And dont for pitys sake brag about her to him

No I wont said the judge and he tacitly repented having done so

The weather had changed and when he went up from this interview
with his wife in their stateroom he found a good many people strung
convalescently along the promenade on their steamerchairs These so
far as they were women were of such sick plainness that when he came
to Ellen his heart throbbed with a glad resentment of her mothers
aspersion of her health and beauty She looked not only very well and
very pretty but in a gay red cap and a trig jacket she looked to her
fathers uncritical eyes very stylish The glow left his heart at eight
of the empty seat beside her

Where is Lottie he asked though it was not Lotties whereabouts that
interested him

Oh shes walking with Mr Breckon somewhere said Ellen

Then shes made up her mind to tolerate him has she the father
asked more lightly than he felt

Ellen smiled That wasnt anything very serious I guess At any rate
shes walking with him

What book is that he asked of the volume she was tilting back and
forth under her hand

She showed it One of his He brought it up to amuse me he said

While he was amusing himself with Lottie thought the judge in his
jealousy for her It is going the same old way Well What he said
aloud was And is it amusing you

I havent looked at it yet said the girl Its amusing enough to
watch the sea Oh poppa I never thought I should care so much for it

And youre glad we came

I dont want to think about that I just want to know that Im here
She pressed his arm gently significantly where he sat provisionally
in the chair beside her and he was afraid to speak lest he should scare
away the hope her words gave him

He merely said Well well and waited for her to speak further But
her impulse had exhausted itself as if her spirit were like one of
those weak forms of life which spend their strength in a quick run or
flight and then rest to gather force for another Wheres Boyne he
asked after waiting for her to speak

He was here a minute ago Hes been talking with some of the deck
passengers that are going home because they couldnt get on in America
Doesnt that seem pitiful poppa I always thought we had work enough
for the whole world

Perhaps these fellows didnt try very hard to find it said the judge

Perhaps she assented

I shouldnt want you to get to thinking that its all like New York
Remember how comfortable everybody is in Tuskingum

Yes she said sadly How far off Tuskingum seems

Well dont forget about it and remember that wherever life is
simplest and purest and kindest that is the highest civilization

How much like old times it seems to hear you talk that way poppa I
should think I was in the library at home And I made you leave it she
sighed

Your mother was glad of any excuse And it will do us all good if we
take it in the right way said the judge with a didactic severity that
did not hide his pang from her

Poor poppa she said

He went away saying that he was going to look Lottie up His simple
design was to send Lottie to her mother so that Breckon might come back
to Ellen but he did not own this to himself

Lottie returned from another direction with Boyne and Ellen said
Poppas gone to look for you

Has he asked Lottie dropping decisively into her chair Well
theres one thing I wont call him poppa any more

What will you call him Boyne demanded demurely

Ill call him father it you want to know and Im going to call momma
mother Im not going to have those English laughing at us and I wont
say papa and mamma Everybody that knows anything says father and mother
now

Boyne kept looking from one sister to another during Lotties
declaration and with his eyes on Ellen he said Its true Ellen
All the Plumptons did He was very serious

Ellen smiled Im too old to change Id rather seem queer in Europe
than when I get back to Tuskingum

You wouldnt be queer there a great while said Lottie Theyll all
be doing it in a week after I get home

Upon the encouragement given him by Ellen Boyne seized the chance
of being of the opposition Yes he taunted Lottie and you think
theyll say woman and man for lady and gentleman I suppose

They will as soon as they know its the thing

Well I know I wont said Boyne I wont call momma a woman

It doesnt matter what you do Boyne dear his sister serenely assured
him

While he stood searching his mind for a suitable retort a young man
not apparently many years his senior came round the corner of the
musicroom and put himself conspicuously in view at a distance from the
Kentons

There he is now said Boyne He wants to be introduced to Lottie
He referred the question to Ellen but Lottie answered for her

Then why dont you introduce him

Well I would if he was an American But you cant tell about these
English He resumed the dignity he had lost in making the explanation
to Lottie and ignored her in turning again to Ellen What do you
think Ellen

Oh dont know about such things Boyne she said shrinking from the
responsibility

Well upon my word cried Lottie If Ellen can talk by the hour
with that precious Mr Breckon and stay up here along with him when
everybody else is down below sick I dont think she can have a great
deal to say about a halfgrown boy like that being introduced to me

Hes as old as you are said Boyne hotly

Oh I saw him associating with you and I thought he was a boy too
Pardon me Lottie turned from giving Boyne his coupdegrace to plant
a little stab in Ellens breast To be sure now Mr Breckon has found
those friends of his I suppose he wont want to flirt with Ellen any
more

Ah ha ha Boyne broke in Lottie is mad because he stopped to speak
to some ladies he knew Women I suppose shed call them

Well I shouldnt call him a gentleman anyway said Lottie

The pretty smoothfaced freshfaced young fellow whom their varying
debate had kept in abeyance looked round at them over his shoulder as
he leaned on the rail and seemed to discover Boyne for the first time
He came promptly towards the Kentons

Now said Lottie rapidly youll just HAVE to

The young fellow touched his cap to the whole group but he ventured to
address only Boyne

Every one seems to be about this morning he said with the cheery
Englishrising infection

Yes answered Boyne with such snubbing coldness that Ellens heart
was touched

Its so pleasant she said after that dark weather

Isnt it cried the young fellow gratefully One doesnt often get
such sunshine as this at sea you know

My sister Miss Kenton Mr Pogis Boyne solemnly intervened And
Miss Lottie Kenton

The pretty boy bowed to each in turn but he made no pretence of
being there to talk with Ellen Have you been ill too he actively
addressed himself to Lottie

No just mad she said I wasnt very sick and that made it all the
worse being down in a poky stateroom when I wanted to walk

And I suppose youve been making up for lost time this morning

Not half said Lottie

Oh do finish the half with me

Lottie instantly rose and flung her sister the wrap she had been
holding ready to shed from the moment the young man had come up Keep
that for me Nell Are you good at catching she asked him

Catching

Yes People she explained and at a sudden twist of the ship she made
a clutch at his shoulder

Oh I think I can catch you

As they moved off together Boyne said Well upon my word but Ellen
did not say anything in comment on Lottie After a while she asked Who
were the ladies that Mr Breckon met

I didnt hear their names They were somebody he hadnt seen before
since the ship started They looked like a young lady and her mother
It made Lottie mad when he stopped to speak with them and she wouldnt
wait till he could get through Ran right away and made me come too




XIII

Breckon had not seen the former interest between himself and Ellen
lapse to commonplace acquaintance without due sense of loss He suffered
justly but he did not suffer passively or without several attempts
to regain the higher ground In spite of these he was aware of being
distinctly kept to the level which he accused himself of having chosen
by a gentle acquiescence in his choice more fatal than snubbing The
advances that he made across the table while he still met Miss Kenton
alone there did not carry beyond the rack supporting her plate She
talked on whatever subject he started with that angelic sincerity which
now seemed so far from him but she started none herself she did not
appeal to him for his opinion upon any question more psychological than
the barometer and

 In a tumultuous privacy of storm

he found himself as much estranged from her as if a fairweather crowd
had surrounded them He did not believe that she resented the levity he
had shown but he had reason to fear that she had finally accepted it as
his normal mood and in her efforts to meet him in it as if he had no
other he read a tolerance that was worse than contempt When he tried
to make her think differently if that was what she thought of him
he fancied her rising to the notion he wished to give her and then
shrinking from it as if it must bring her the disappointment of some
trivial joke

It was what he had taught her to expect of him and he had himself to
blame Now that he had thrown that precious chance away he might well
have overvalued it She had certain provincialisms which he could not
ignore She did not know the right use of will and shall and would and
should and she pronounced the letter r with a hard midWestern twist
Her voice was weak and thin and she could not govern it from being at
times a gasp and at times a drawl She did not dress with the authority
of women who know more of their clothes than the people they buy them
of she did not carry herself like a pretty girl she had not the
definite stamp of youngladyism Yet she was undoubtedly a lady in every
instinct she wore with pensive grace the clothes which she had not
subjected to her personal taste and if she did not carry herself like a
pretty girl she had a beauty which touched and entreated

More and more Breckon found himself studying her beautyher soft brown
brows her gentle dark eyes a little sunken and with the lids pinched
by suffering the cheeks somewhat thin but not colorless the long
chin the clear forehead and the massed brown hair that seemed too
heavy for the drooping neck It was not the modern athletic type it
was rather of the earlier period when beauty was associated with the
fragility despised by a tanned and golfing generation Ellen Kentons
wrists were thin and her hands long and narrow As he looked at her
across the racks during those two days of storm he had sometimes the
wish to take her long narrow hands in his and beg her to believe that
he was worthier her serious friendship than he had shown himself What
he was sure of at all times now was that he wished to know the secret
of that patient pathos of hers She was not merely or primarily an
invalid Her family had treated her as an invalid but except Lottie
whose rigor might have been meant sanatively they treated her more with
the tenderness people use with a wounded spirit and Breckon fancied
moments of something like humility in her when she seemed to cower from
his notice These were not so imaginable after her family took to their
berths and left her alone with him but the touching mystery remained a
sort of bewilderment as he guessed it a surprise such as a child
might show at some incomprehensible harm It was this grief which he had
refused not merely to knowhe still doubted his right to know itbut
to share he had denied not only his curiosity but his sympathy and
had exiled himself to a region where when her family came back with
the fair weather he felt himself farther from her than before their
acquaintance began

He had made an overture to its renewal in the book he lent her and then
Mrs Rasmith and her daughter had appeared on deck and borne down
upon him when he was walking with Lottie Kenton and trying to begin his
selfretrieval through her She had left him but they had not and in
the bonds of a prophet and his followers he found himself bound with
them for much more conversation than he had often held with them ashore
The parochial duties of an ethical teacher were not strenuous and
Breckon had not been made to feel them so definitely before Mrs
Rasmith held that they now included promising to sit at her table for
the rest of the voyage but her daughter succeeded in releasing him from
the obligation and it was she who smilingly detached the clinging
hold of the elder lady We mustnt keep Mr Breckon from his friends
mother she said brightly and then he said he should like the
pleasure of introducing them and both of the ladies declared that they
would be delighted

He bowed himself off and half the shipslength away he was aware from
meeting Lottie with her little Englishman that it was she and not Ellen
whom he was seeking As the couple paused in whirring past Breckon long
enough to let Lottie make her hat fast against the wind he heard the
Englishman shout

I say that sister of yours is a fine girl isnt she

Shes a pretty goodlooker Lottie answered back Whats the matter
with HER sister

Oh I say her companion returned in a transport with her slangy
pertness which Breckon could not altogether refuse to share

He thought that he ought to condemn it and he did condemn Mrs Kenton
for allowing it in one of her daughters when he came up to her sitting
beside another whom he felt inexpressibly incapable of it Mrs Kenton
could have answered his censure if she had known it that daughters
like sons were not what their mothers but what their environments made
them and that the same environment sometimes made them different as he
saw She could have told him that Lottie with her slangy pertness had
the truest and best of the men she knew at her feet and that Ellen
with her meekness had been the prey of the commonest and cheapest
spirit in her world and so left him to make an inference as creditable
to his sex as he could But this bold defence was as far from the poor
lady as any spoken reproach was from him Her daughter had to check in
her a mechanical offer to rise as if to give Breckon her place the
theory and practice of Tuskingum being that their elders ought to leave
young people alone together

Dont go momma Ellen whispered I dont want you to go

Breckon when he arrived before them remained talking on foot and
unlike Lotties company he talked to the mother This had happened
before from him but she had not got used to it and now she deprecated
in everything but words his polite questions about her sufferings from
the rough weather and his rejoicing that the worst was probably over
She ventured the hope that it was so for she said that Mr Kenton had
about decided to keep on to Holland and it seemed to her that they had
had enough of storms He said he was glad that they were going right on
and then she modestly recurred to the earlier opinion he had given
her husband that it would be better to spend the rest of the summer in
Holland than to go to Italy as if she wished to conform herself in the
wisdom of Mr Kentons decision He repeated his conviction and he said
that if he were in their place he should go to The Hague as soon as they
had seen Rotterdam and make it their headquarters for the exploration
of the whole country

You cant realize how little it is you can get anywhere in an hour
the difficulty is to keep inside of Holland when you leave any given
point I envy you going there

Mrs Kenton inferred that he was going to stop in France but if it were
part of his closeness not to tell it was part of her pride not to ask
She relented when he asked if he might get a map of his and prove the
littleness of Holland from it and in his absence she could not well
avoid saying to Ellen He seems very pleasant

Yes why not the girl asked

I dont know Lottie is so against him

He was very kind when you were all sick

Well you ought to know better than Lottie youve seen him so much
more Ellen was silent and her mother advanced cautiously I suppose
he is very cultivated

How can I tell Im not

Why Ellen I think you are Very few girls have read so much

Yes but he wouldnt care if I were cultivated Ha is like all the
rest He would like to joke and laugh Well I think that is nice too
and I wish I could do it But I never could and now I cant try I
suppose he wonders what makes me such a dead weight on you all

You know youre not that Ellen You musnt let yourself be morbid It
hurts me to have you say such things

Well I should like to tell him why and see what he would say

Ellen

Why not If he is a minister he must have thought about all kinds
of things Do you suppose he ever knew of a girl before who had been
through what I have Yes I would like to know what he would really
say

I know what he ought to say If he knew he would say that no girl had
ever behaved more angelically

Do you think he would Perhaps he would say that if I hadnt been so
proud and sillyHere he comes Shall we ask him

Breckon approached with his map and her mother gasped thinking how
terrible such a thing would be if it could be Ellen smiled brightly up
at him Will you take my chair And then you can show momma your map I
am going down and while he was still protesting she was gone

Miss Kenton seems so much better than she did the first day he said
as he spread the map out on his knees and gave Mrs Kenton one end to
hold

Yes the mother assented as she bent over to look at it

She followed his explanation with a surface sense while her nether mind
was full of the worry of the question which Ellen had planted in it
What would such a man think of what she had been through Or rather
how would he say to her the only things that in Mrs Kentons belief he
could say How could the poor child ever be made to see it in the
light of some mind not colored with her familys affection for her An
immense an impossible longing possessed itself of the mothers heart
which became the more insistent the more frantic it appeared She
uttered Yes and No and Indeed to what he was saying but all the
time she was rehearsing Ellens story in her inner sense In the end she
remembered so little what had actually passed that her dramatic reverie
seemed the reality and when she left him she got herself down to
her stateroom giddy with the shame and fear of her imaginary
selfbetrayal She wished to test the enormity and yet not find it so
monstrous by submitting the case to her husband and she could scarcely
keep back her impatience at seeing Ellen instead of her father

Momma what have you been saying to Mr Breckon about me

Nothing said Mrs Kenton aghast at first and then astonished to
realize that she was speaking the simple truth He said how much better
you were looking but I dont believe I spoke a single word We were
looking at the map

Very well Ellen resumed I have been thinking it all over and now I
have made up my mind

She paused and her mother asked tremulously About what Ellen

You know momma I see all now You neednt be afraid that I care
anything about him now and her mother knew that she meant Bittridge
or that I ever shall Thats gone forever But its gone she added
and her mother quaked inwardly to hear her reason because the wrong
and the shame was all for mefor us Thats why I can forgive it
and forget If we had done anything the least thing in the world to
revenge ourselves or to hurt him thenDont you see momma

I think I see Ellen

Then I should have to keep thinking about it and what we had made him
suffer and whether we hadnt given him some claim I dont wish ever
to think of him again You and poppa were so patient and forbearing all
through and I thank goodness now for everything you put up with only I
wish I could have borne everything myself

You had enough to bear Mrs Kenton said in tender evasion

Im glad that I had to bear so much for bearing it is what makes me
free now She went up to her mother and kissed her and gazed into her
face with joyful tearful looks that made her heart sink




XIV

Mrs Kenton did not rest till she had made sure from Lottie and Boyne
that neither of them had dropped any hint to Ellen of what happened to
Bittridge after his return to Tuskingum She did not explain to them why
she was so very anxious to know but only charged them the more solemnly
not to let the secret which they had all been keeping from Ellen
escape them

They promised but Lottie said Shes got to know it some time and I
should think the sooner the better

I will be judge of that Lottie said her mother and Boyne seized his
chance of inculpating her with his friend Mr Pogis He said she
was carrying on awfully with him already and an Englishman could not
understand and Boyne hinted that he would presume upon her American
freedom

Well if he does Ill get you to cowhide him Boyne she retorted
and left him fuming helplessly while she went to give the young
Englishman an opportunity of resuming the flirtation which her mother
had interrupted

With her husband Mrs Kenton found it practicable to be more explicit
I havent had such a load lifted off my heart since I dont know when
It shows me what Ive thought all along that Ellen hasnt really cared
anything for that miserable thing since he first began going with Mrs
Uphill a year ago When he wrote that letter to her in New York she
wanted to be sure she didnt and when he offered himself and misbehaved
so to both of you she was afraid that she and you were somehow to
blame Now shes worked it out that no one else was wronged and she is
satisfied Its made her feel free as she says But oh dear me Mrs
Kenton broke off I talk as if there was nothing to bind her and yet
there is what poor Richard did What would she say if she knew that
I have been cautioning Lottie and Boyne but I know it will come out
somehow Do you think its wise to keep it from her Hadnt we better
tell her Or shall we wait and see

Kenton would not allow to her or to himself that his hopes ran with
hers love is not business with a man as it is with a woman he feels it
indecorous and indelicate to count upon it openly where she thinks it
simply a chance of life to be considered like another All that Kenton
would say was I see no reason for telling her just yet She will have
to know in due time But let her enjoy her freedom now

Yes Mrs Kenton doubtfully assented

The judge was thoughtfully silent Then he said Few girls could have
worked out her problem as Ellen has Think how differently Lottie would
have done it

Lottie has her good points too said Mrs Kenton And of course I
dont blame Richard There are all kinds of girls and Lottie means no
more harm than Ellen does Shes the kind that cant help attracting
but I always knew that Ellen was attractive too if she would only find
it out And I knew that as soon as anything worth while took up her mind
she would never give that wretch another thought

Kenton followed her devious ratiocinations to a conclusion which he
could not grasp What do you mean Sarah

If I only she explained in terms that did not explain felt as sure
of him as I do about him

Her husband looked densely at her Bittridge

No Mr Breckon He is very nice Rufus Yes he is Hes been showing
me the map of Holland and weve had a long talk He isnt the way
we thoughtor I did He is not at all clerical or worldly And he
appreciates Ellen I dont suppose he cares so much for her being
cultivated I suppose she doesnt seem so to him But he sees how wise
she ishow good And he couldnt do that without being good himself
Rufus If we could only hope such a thing But of course there are
thousands after him

There are not thousands of Ellens after him said the judge before he
could take time to protest And I dont want him to suppose that she is
after him at all If he will only interest her and help her to keep her
mind off herself its all I will ask of him I am not anxious to part
with her now that shes all ours again

Of course Mrs Kenton soothingly assented And I dont say that she
dreams of him in any such way She cant help admiring his mind But
what I mean is that when you see how he appreciates her you cant help
wishing he could know just how wise and just how good she is It did
seem to me as if I would give almost anything to have him know what she
had been through with thatrapscallion

Sarah

Oh you may Sarah me But I can tell you what Mr Kenton I believe
that you could tell him every word of it and only make him appreciate
her the more Till you know that about Ellen you dont know what a
character she is I just ached to tell him

I dont understand you my dear said Kenton But if you mean to tell
him

Why who could imagine doing such a thing Dont you see that it is
impossible Such a thing would never have come into my head if it hadnt
been for some morbid talk of Ellens

Of Ellens

Oh about wanting to disgust him by telling him why she was such a
burden to us

She isnt a burden

I am saying what she said And it made me think that if such a person
could only know the highminded way she had found to get out of her
trouble I would like somebody who is capable of valuing her to value
her in all her preciousness Wouldnt you be glad if such a man as he is
could know how and why she feels free at last

I dont think its necessary said Kenton haughtily Theres only
one thing that could give him the right to know it and well wait for
that first I thought you said that he was frivolous

Boyne said that and Lottie I took it for granted till I talked with
him today He is lighthearted and gay he likes to laugh and joke but
he can be very serious when he wants to

According to all precedent said the judge glumly such a man ought
to be hanging round Lottie Everybody was that amounted to anything in
Tuskingum

Oh in Tuskingum And who were the men there that amounted to anything
A lot of young lawyers and two students of medicine and some railroad
clerks There wasnt one that would compare with Mr Breckon for a
moment

All the more reason why he cant really care for Ellen Now see here
Sarah You know I dont interfere with you and the children but Im
afraid youre in a craze about this young fellow Hes got these friends
of his who have just turned up and well wait and see what he does with
them I guess he appreciates the young lady as much as he does Ellen

Mrs Kentons heart went down She doesnt compare with Ellen she
piteously declared

Thats what we think He may think differently

Mrs Kenton was silenced but all the more she was determined to make
sure that Mr Breckon was not interested in Miss Rasmith in any measure
or manner detrimental to Ellen As for Miss Rasmith herself Mrs Kenton
would have had greater reason to be anxious about her behavior with
Boyne than Mr Breckon From the moment that the minister had made his
two groups of friends acquainted the young lady had fixed upon Boyne
as that member of the Kenton group who could best repay a more intimate
friendship She was polite to them all but to Boyne she was flattering
and he was too little used to deference from ladies ten years his senior
not to be very sensible of her worth in offering it To be unremittingly
treated as a grownup person was an experience so dazzling that his
vision was blinded to any possibilities in the behavior that formed it
and before the day ended Boyne had possessed Miss Rasmith of all that it
was important for any fellowbeing to know of his character and history
He opened his heart to eyes that had looked into others before his
less for the sake of exploiting than of informing himself In the rare
intelligence of Miss Rasmith he had found that serious patience with
his problems which no one else not Ellen herself had shown and
after trying her sincerity the greater part of the day he put it to
the supreme test one evening with a book which he had been reading
Boynes literature was largely entomological and zoological but this
was a work of fiction treating of the fortunes of a young American
adventurer who had turned his military education to account in the
service of a German princess Her Highnesss dominions were not in any
map of Europe and perhaps it was her condition of political incognito
that rendered her the more fittingly the prey of a passion for the
American head of her armies Boynes belief was that this character
veiled a real identity and he wished to submit to Miss Rasmith the
question whether in the exclusive circles of New York society any young
millionaire was known to have taken service abroad after leaving west
Point He put it in the form of a scoffing incredulity which it was a
comfort to have her take as if almost hurt by his doubt She said that
such a thing might very well be and with rich American girls marrying
all sorts of titles abroad it was not impossible for some brilliant
young fellow to make his way to the steps of a throne Boyne declared
that she was laughing at him and she protested that it was the last
thing she should think of doing she was too much afraid of him Then he
began to argue against the case supposed in the romance he proved from
the book itself that the thing could not happen such a princess would
not be allowed to marry the American no matter how rich he was She
owned that she had not heard of just such an instance and he might
think her very romantic and perhaps she was but if the princess was an
absolute princess such as she was shown in that story she held that
no power on earth could keep her from marrying the young American For
herself she did not see though how the princess could be in love
with that type of American If she had been in the princesss place she
should have fancied something quite different She made Boyne agree with
her that Eastern Americans were all more or less Europeanized and it
stood to reason she held that a European princess would want something
as unEuropean as possible if she was falling in love to please herself
They had some contention upon the point that the princess would want
a Western American and then Miss Rasmith with a delicate audacity
painted an heroic portrait of Boyne himself which he could not recognize
openly enough to disown but he perceived resemblances in it which went
to his head when she demurely rose with a soft Goodnight Mr Kenton
I suppose I mustnt call you Boyne

Oh yes do he entreated ImIm not grown up yet you know

Then it will be safe she sighed But I should never have thought
of that I had got so absorbed in our argument You are so logical Mr
KentonBoyne I meanthank you You must get it from your father How
lovely your sister is

Ellen

Well no I meant the other one But Miss Kenton is beautiful too You
must be so happy together all of you She added with a rueful smile
Theres only one of me Goodnight

Boyne did not know whether he ought not in humanity if not gallantry
to say he would be a brother to her but while he stood considering she
put out a hand to him so covered with rings that he was afraid she had
hurt herself in pressing his so hard and had left him before he could
decide

Lottie walking the deck had not thought of bidding Mr Pogis
goodnight She had asked him half a dozen times how late it was and
when he answered had said as often that she knew better and she was
going below in another minute But she stayed and the flow of her
conversation supplied him with occasion for the remarks of which he
seldom varied the formula When she said something too audacious for
silent emotion he called out Oh I say If she advanced an opinion
too obviously acceptable or asked a question upon some point where
it seemed to him there could not be two minds he was ready with the
ironical note Well rather At times she pressed her studies of his
character and her observations on his manner and appearance so far that
he was forced to protest You are so personal But these moments
were rare for the most part Oh I say and Well rather perfectly
covered the ground He did not generally mind her parody of his poverty
of phrase but once after she had repeated Well rather and Oh
I say steadily at everything he said for the whole round of the
promenade they were making he intimated that there were occasions when
in his belief a womans abuse of the freedom generously allowed her sex
passed the point of words

And when it passes the point of words she taunted him what do you
do

You will see he said if it ever does and Lottie felt justified by
her inference that he was threatening to kiss her in answering

And if I ever SEE I will box your ears

Oh I say he retorted I should like to have you try

He had ideas of the rightful mastery of a man in all things which
she promptly pronounced brutal and when he declared that his fathers
conduct towards his wife and children was based upon these ideas she
affirmed the superiority of her own fathers principles and behavior
Mr Pogis was too declared an admirer of Judge Kenton to question
his motives or method in anything and he could only generalize The
Americans spoil their women

Well their women are worth it said Lottie and after allowing the
paradox time to penetrate his intelligence he cried out in a glad
transport

Oh I SAY

At the moment Boynes intellectual seance with Miss Rasmith was
coming to an end Lottie had tacitly invited Mr Pogis to prolong the
comparison of English and American family life by stopping in front of
a couple of steamerchairs and confessing that she was tired to death
They sat down and he told her about his mother whom although his
fathers subordinate he seemed to be rather fonder of He had some
elder brothers most of them in the colonies and he had himself been
out to America looking at something his father had found for him in
Buffalo

You ought to come to Tuskingum said Lottie

Is that a large place Mr Pogis asked As large as Buffalo

Well no Lottie admitted But its a growing place And we have the
best kind of times

What kind The young man easily consented to turn the commercial into
a social inquiry

Oh picnics and river parties and buggyrides and dances

Im keen on dancing said Mr Pogis I hope theyll give us a dance
on board Will you put me down for the first dance

I dont care Will you send me some flowers The steward must have some
left in the refrigerator

Well rather Ill send you a spray if hes got enough

A spray Whats a spray

Oh I say My sister always wears one Its a long chain of flowers
reachin from your shoulder diagonally down to your waist

Does your sister always have her sprays sent to her

Well rather Dont they send flowers to girls for dances in the
States

Well rather Didnt I just ask you

This was very true and after a moment of baffle Mr Pogis said in
generalization If you go with a young lady in a party to the theatre
you send her a box of chocolates

Only when you go to theatre I couldnt get enough then unless you
asked me every night said Lottie and while Mr Pogis was trying to
choose between Oh I say and something specific like I should like
to ask you every night she added And what would happen if you sent a
girl a spray for the theatre and chocolates for a dance Wouldnt it jar
her

Now indeed there was nothing for him but to answer Oh I say

Well say then Here comes Boyne and I must go Well Boyne she
called from the dark nook where she sat to her brother as he stumbled
near with his eyes to the stars has the old lady retired

He gave himself away finely What old lady

Well maybe at your age you dont consider her very old But I dont
think a boy ought to sit up mooning at his grandmother all night I know
Miss Rasmiths no relation if thats what youre going to say

Oh I say Mr Pogis chuckled You are so personal

Well rather said Lottie punishing his presumption But I dont
think its nice for a kid even if she isnt

Kid Boyne ground through his clenched teeth

By this time Lottie was up out of her chair and beyond repartee in her
flight down the gangway stairs She left the two youngsters confronted

What do you say to a lemonsquash asked Mr Pogis respecting his
friends wounded dignity and ignoring Lottie and her offence

I dont care if I do said Boyne in gloomy acquiescence




XV

Few witnesses of the fact that Julia Rasmith and her mother had found
themselves on the same steamer with the Rev Hugh Breckon would have
been of such a simple mind as to think they were there by accident if
they had also been witnesses of their earlier history The ladies could
have urged that in returning from California only a few days before
the Amstel sailed and getting a stateroom which had been unexpectedly
given up they had some claim to a charitable interpretation of their
behavior but this plea could not have availed them with any connoisseur
of women Besides it had been a matter of notoriety among such of Mr
Breckons variegated congregation as knew one another that Mrs Rasmith
had set her heart on him it Julia had not set her cap for him In that
pied flock where every shade and dapple of doubt from heterodox Jew to
agnostic Christian foregathered as it has been said in the misgiving
of a blessed immortality the devotion of Mrs Rasmith to the minister
had been almost a scandal Nothing had saved the appearance from this
character but Mr Breckons open acceptance of her flatteries and
hospitalities this was so frank and the behavior of Julia herself so
judicious under the circumstances that envy and virtue were if not
equally silenced equally baffled So far from pretending not to see her
mothers manoeuvres Julia invited public recognition of them in the
way of joking which she kept within the limits of filial fondness she
made fun of her mothers infatuation to Breckon himself and warned
him against the moment when her wiles might be too much for him Before
other people she did not hesitate to save him from her mother so that
even those who believed her in the conspiracy owned that no girl could
have managed with more cleverness in a situation where not every one
would have refused to be placed In this situation Julia Rasmith had the
service of a very clear head and as was believed by some a cool heart
if she and her mother had joint designs upon the minister hers was the
ambition and her mothers the affection that prompted them She was a
long undulant girl of a mixed blondness that left you in doubt after
you had left her whether her hair or her complexion were not of one
tint but her features were good and there could be no question of her
captivating laugh and her charming mouth which she was always pulling
down with demure irony She was like her mother in her looks but her
indolent droning temperament must have been from her father whose
memory was lost in that antiquity which swallows up the record of so
many widows husbands and who could not have left her what was left of
her mothers money for none of it had ever been his It was still her
mothers and it was supposed to be the daughters chief attraction
There must therefore have been a good deal of it for those who were
harshest with the minister did not believe that a little money would
attract him Not that they really thought him mercenary some of his
people considered him gay to the verge of triviality but there were
none that accused him of insincerity They would have liked a little
more seriousness in him especially when they had not much of their
own and would have had him make up in severity of behavior for what he
lacked and what they wished him to lack in austerity of doctrine

The Amstel had lost so much time in the rough weather of her first days
out that she could not make it up with her oldfashioned single screw
She was at best a tenday boat counting from Sandy Hook to Boulogne
and she had not been four days out when she promised to break her record
for slowness Three days later Miss Rasmith said to Breckon as he took
the chair which her mother agilely abandoned to him beside her The
head steward says it will be a twelveday trip end our bedroom steward
thinks more What is the consensus of opinion in the smokingroom Where
are you going mother Are you planning to leave Mr Breckon and me
alone again It isnt necessary We couldnt get away from each other
if we tried and all we askWell I suppose age must be indulged in its
little fancies she called after Mrs Rasmith

Breckon took up the question she had asked him The odds are so heavily
in favor of a fifteendays run that there are no takers

Now you are joking again she said I thought a seavoyage might make
you serious

It has been tried before Besides its you that I want to be serious

What about Besides I doubt it

About Boyne

Oh I thought you were going to say some one else

No I think that is very well settled

Youll never persuade my mother said Miss Rasmith with a low
comfortable laugh

But if you are satisfied

She will have to resign herself Well perhaps But why do you wish me
to be serious about Boyne

I have no doubt he amuses you But that doesnt seem a very good reason
why you should amuse yourself with him

No Why not

Well because the poor boy is in earnest and youre not
exactlycontemporaries

Why how old is Boyne she asked with affected surprise

About fifteen I think said Breckon gravely

And Im but a very few months past thirty I dont see the great
disparity But he is merely a brother to mean elder brotherand he
gives me the best kind of advice

I dare say you need it but all the same I am afraid you are putting
ideas into his head

Well if he began it If he put them in mine first

She was evidently willing that he should go further and create the
common ground between them that grows up when one gives a reproof and
the other accepts it but Breckon whether he thought that he had now
done his duty and need say no more or because he was vexed with her
left the subject

Mrs Rasmith says you are going to Switzerland for the rest of the
summer

Yes to Montreux Are you going to spend it in Paris

Im going to Paris to see I have had some thoughts of Etretat I have
cousins there

I wish that I could go to the seaside But this happens to be one of
the summers when nothing but mountains can save my mothers life Shall
you get down to Rome before you go back

I dont know If I sail from Naples I shall probably pass through
Rome

You had better stop off We shall be there in November and they
say Rome is worth seeing she laughed demurely That is what Boyne
understands Hes promised to use his influence with his family to let
him run down to see us there if he cant get them all to come You
might offer to personally conduct them

Yes said Breckon with the effect of cloture Have you made many
acquaintances an board

What Two lone women You havent introduced us to any but the Kentons
But I dare say they are the best The judge is a dear and Mrs Kenton
is everything that is motherly and matronly Boyne says she is very well
informed and knows all about the reigning families If he decides
to marry into them she can be of great use in saving him from a
mesalliance I cant say very much for Miss Lottie Miss Lottie seems to
me distinctly of the minx type But that poor pale girl is adorable I
wish she liked me

What makes you think she doesnt like you Breckon asked

What Women dont require anything to convince them that other women
cant bear them They simply know it I wonder what has happened to
her

Why do you think anything has happened to her

Why Well girls dont have that air of melancholy absence for nothing
She is brooding upon something you may be sure But you have had so
many more opportunities than I Do you mean that you havent suspected a
tragical past far her

I dont know said Breckon a little restively that I have allowed
myself to speculate about her past

That is you oughtnt to have allowed yourself to do so Well there
I agree with you But a woman may do so without impertinence and I am
sure that Miss Kenton has a story I have watched her and her face has
told me everything but the story

Breckon would not say that some such revelation had been made to him
and in the absence of an answer from him Miss Rasmith asked Is she
cultivated too

Too

Like her mother

Oh I should say she had read a good dial And shes bookish yes in a
simplehearted kind of way

She asks you if you have read the book of the year and whether you
dont think the heroine is a beautiful character

Not quite so bad as that But if you care to be serious about her

Oh I do

I doubt it Then I should say that she seems to have grown up in a
place where the interests are so material that a girl who was disposed
to be thoughtful would be thrown back upon reading for her society more
than in more intellectual centresif there are such things She has
been so much with books that she does not feel odd in speaking of them
as if they were the usual topics of conversation It gives her a certain
quaintness

And that is what constitutes her charm

I didnt know that we were speaking of her charm

No that is true But I was thinking of it She fascinates me Are they
going to get off at Boulogne

No they are going on to Rotterdam

To be sure Boyne told me And are you going on with them

I thought we talked of my going to Paris Breckon looked round at her
and she made a gesture of deprecation

Why of course How could I forget But Im so much interested in Miss
Kenton that I cant think of anything else

Not even of Miss Rasmith

Not even of Miss Rasmith I know that she has a history and that its
a sad one She paused in ironical hesitation Youve been so good as
to caution me about her brotherand I never can be grateful enoughand
that makes me almost free to suggest

She stopped again and he asked hardily What

Oh nothing It isnt for me to remind my pastor my ghostly
advisershe pulled down her mouth and glanced at him demurelyand
I will only offer the generalization that a girl is never so much in
danger of having her heart broken as when shes had it brokenOh are
you leaving me she cried as Breckon rose from his chair

Well then send Boyne to me She broke into a laugh as he faltered
Are you going to sit down again That is right And I wont talk any
more about Miss Kenton

I dont mind talking of her said Breckon Perhaps it will even be
well to do so if you are in earnest Though it strikes me that you have
rather renounced the right to criticise me

Now is that logical It seems to me that in putting myself in the
attitude of a final friend at the start and refusing to be anything
more I leave established my right to criticise you on the firmest
basis I cant possibly be suspected of interested motives Besides
youve just been criticizing me if you want a womans reason

Well go on

Why I had finished Thats the amusing part I should have supposed
that I could go on forever about Miss Kenton but I have nothing to go
upon She has kept her secret very well and so have the rest of them
You think I might have got it out of Boyne Perhaps I might but you
know I have my little scruples I dont think it would be quite fair or
quite nice

You are scrupulous And I give you credit for having been more delicate
than Ive been

You dont mean youve been trying to find it out

Ah now Im not sure about the superior delicacy

Oh how good said Miss Rasmith What a pity you should be wasted in
a calling that limits you so much

You call it limiting I didnt know but I had gone too far

Not at all You know theres nothing I like so much as those little
digs

I had forgotten Then you wont mind my saying that this surveillance
seems to me rather more than I have any right to from you

How exquisitely you put it Who else could have told me to mind my
own business so delightfully Well it isnt my business I acknowledge
that and I spoke only because I knew you would be sorry if you had gone
too far I remembered our promise to be friends

She threw a touch of real feeling into her tone and he responded Yes
and I thank you for it though it isnt easy

She put out her hand to him and as he questioningly took it she
pressed his with animation Of course it isnt Or it wouldnt be for
any other man But dont you suppose I appreciate that supreme courage
of yours There is nobody elsenobodywho could stand up to an
impertinence and turn it to praise by such humility

Dont go too far or I shall be turning your praise to impertinence
by my humility Youre quite right though about the main matter I
neednt suppose anything so preposterous as you suggest to feel that
people are best left alone to outlive their troubles unless they are of
the most obvious kind

Now if I thought I had done anything to stop you from offering that
sort of helpfulness which makes you a blessing to everybody I should
never forgive myself

Nothing so dire as that I believe But if youve made me question the
propriety of applying the blessing in all cases you have done a very
good thing

Miss Rasmith was silent and apparently serious After a moment she said
And I for my part promise to let poor little Boyne alone

Breckon laughed Dont burlesque it Besides I havent promised
anything

That is very true said Miss Rasmith and she laughed too




XVI

In one of those dramatic reveries which we all hold with ourselves when
fortune has pressingly placed us Ellen Kenton had imagined it possible
for her to tell her story to the man who had so gently and truly tried
to be her friend It was mostly in the way of explaining to him how she
was unworthy of his friendship that the story was told and she fancied
telling it without being scandalized at violating the conventions that
should have kept her from even dreaming of such a thing It was all
exalted to a plane where there was no question of fit or unfit in doing
it but only the occasion and he would never hear of the unworthiness
which she wished to ascribe to herself Sometimes he mournfully left
her when she persisted left her forever and sometimes he refused
and retained with her in a sublime kindness a noble amity lofty and
serene which did not seek to become anything else In this case she
would break from her reveries with selfaccusing cries under her
breath of Silly silly Oh how disgusting and if at that moment
Breckon were really coming up to sit by her she would blush to her
hair and wish to run away and failing the force for this would sit
cold and blank to his civilities and have to be skilfully and gradually
talked back to selfrespect and selftolerance

The recurrence of these reveries and their consequence in her made it
difficult for him to put in effect the promise he had given himself in
Miss Rasmiths presence If Ellen had been eager to welcome his coming
it would have been very simple to keep away from her but as she
appeared anxious to escape him and had to be entreated as it were
to suffer his society something better than his curiosity was piqued
though that was piqued too He believed that he saw her lapsing again
into that morbid state from which he had seemed once able to save her
and he could not help trying again He was the more bound to do so by
the ironical observance of Miss Rasmith who had to be defied first and
then propitiated certainly when she saw him apparently breaking faith
with her she had a right to some sort of explanation but certainly
also she had no right to a blind and unreasoning submission from him
His embarrassment was heightened by her interest in Miss Kenton
whom with an admirable show of now finding her safe from Breckons
attractions she was always wishing to study from his observation What
was she really like The girl had a perfect fascination for her she
envied him his opportunities of knowing her and his privileges of
making that melancholy face light up with that heartbreaking smile and
of banishing that delicious shyness with which she always seemed to meet
him Miss Rasmith had noticed it how could she help noticing it

Breckon wished to himself that she had been able to help noticing it or
were more capable of minding her own business than she showed herself
and his heart closed about Ellen with a tenderness that was dangerously
indignant At the same time he felt himself withheld by Miss Rasmiths
witness from being all to the girl that he wished to be and that he now
seemed to have been in those first days of storm while Miss Rasmith and
her mother were still keeping their cabin He foresaw that it would end
in Miss Rasmiths sympathetic nature not being able to withhold itself
from Ellens need of cheerful companionship and he was surprised as
little as he was pleased one morning when he came to take the chair
beside her to find Miss Rasmith in it talking and laughing to the girl
who perversely showed herself amused Miss Rasmith made as if to offer
him the seat but he had to go away disappointed after standing long
enough before them to be aware that they were suspending some topic
while he stayed

He naturally supposed the topic to be himself but it was not so or at
least not directly so It was only himself as related to the scolding he
had given Miss Rasmith for trifling with the innocence of Boyne which
she wished Miss Kenton to understand as the effect of a real affection
for her brother She loved all boys and Boyne was simply the most
delightful creature in the world She went on to explain how delightful
he was and showed a such an appreciation of the infantile sweetness
mingled with the mature severity of Boynes character that Ellen could
not help being pleased and won She told some little stories of Boyne
that threw a light also their home life in Tuskingum and Miss Rasmith
declared herself perfectly fascinated and wished that she could go and
live in Tuskingum She protested that she should not find it dull Boyne
alone would be entertainment enough and she figured a circumstance so
idyllic from the hints she had gathered that Ellens brow darkened in
silent denial and Miss Rasmith felt herself as the children say in
the game very hot in her proximity to the girls secret She would have
liked to know it but whether she felt that she could know it when
she liked enough or whether she should not be so safe with Breckon in
knowing it she veered suddenly away and said that she was so glad to
have Boynes family know the peculiar nature of her devotion which
did not necessarily mean running away with him though it might come
to that She supposed she was a little morbid about it from what Mr
Breckon had been saying he had a conscience that would break the peace
of a whole community though he was the greatest possible favorite not
only with his own congregation which simply worshipped him but with
the best society where he was in constant request

It was not her fault if she did not overdo these history but perhaps
it was all true about the number of girls who were ready and willing to
marry him It might even be true though she had no direct authority for
saying it that he had made up his mind never to marry and that was the
reason why he felt himself so safe in being the nicest sort of friend
He was safe Miss Rasmith philosophized but whether other people were
so safe was a different question There were girls who were said to
be dying for him but of course those things were always said about a
handsome young minister She had frankly taken him on his own ground
from the beginning and she believed that this was what he liked At any
rate they had agreed that they were never to be anything but the best
of friends and they always had been

Mrs Kenton came and shyly took the chair on Miss Rasmiths other side
and Miss Rasmith said they had been talking about Mr Breckon and she
repeated what she had been saying to Ellen Mrs Kenton assented more
openly than Ellen could to her praises but when she went away and her
daughter sat passive without comment or apparent interest the mother
drew a long involuntary sigh

Do you like her Ellen

She tries to be pleasant I think

Do you think she really knows much about Mr Breckon

Oh yes Why not She belongs to his church

He doesnt seem to me like a person who would have a parcel of girls
tagging after him

That is what they do in the East Boyne says

I wish she would let Boyne alone She is making a fool of the child
Hes round with her every moment I think she ought to be ashamed such
an old thing

Ellen chose to protest or thought it fair to do so I dont believe
she is doing him any harm She just lets him talk out and everybody
else checks him up so It was nice of her to come and talk with me when
we had all been keeping away from her Perhaps he sent her though She
says they have always been such good friends because she wouldnt be
anything else from the beginning

I dont see why she need have told you that

Oh it was just to show he was run after I wonder if he thinks we are
running after him Momma I am tired of him I wish he wouldnt speak to
me any more

Why do you really dislike him Ellen

No not dislike him But it tires me to have him trying to amuse me
Dont you understand

Mrs Kenton said yes she understood but she was clear only of the fact
that Ellen seemed flushed and weak at that moment She believed that
it was Miss Rasmith and not Mr Breckon who was to blame but she said
Well you neednt worry about it long It will only be a day or two now
till we get to Boulogne and then he will leave us Hadnt you better go
down now and rest awhile in your berth I will bring your things

Ellen rose pulling her wraps from her skirts to give them to her
mother A voice from behind said between their meeting shoulders Oh
are you going down I was just coming to beg Miss Kenton to take a
little walk with me and they looked round together and met Breckons
smiling face

Im afraid Mrs Kenton began and then like a welltrained American
mother she stopped and left the affair to her daughter

Do you think you can get down with them momma the girl asked and
somehow her mothers heart was lightened by her evasion not to call it
uncandor It was at least not morbid it was at least like other girls
and Mrs Kenton imparted what comfort there was in it to the judge when
he asked where she had left Ellen

Not that its any use she sighed when she had seen him share it with
a certain shamefacedness That woman has got her grip on him and she
doesnt mean to let go

Kenton understood Miss Rasmith by that woman but he would not allow
himself to be so easily cast down This was one of the things that
provoked Mrs Kenton with him when he had once taken hope he would not
abandon it without reason I dont see any evidence of her having her
grip on him Ive noticed him and he doesnt seem attentive to her I
should say he tried to avoid her He certainly doesnt avoid Ellen

What are you thinking of Rufus

What are you You know wed both be glad if he fancied her

Well suppose we would I dont deny it He is one of the most
agreeable gentlemen I ever saw one of the kindest and nicest

Hes more than that said the judge Ive been sounding him on
various points and I dont see where hes wrong Of course I dont
know much about his religious persuasion if it is one but I think Im
a pretty fair judge of character and that young man has character
He isnt a light person though he likes joking and laughing and he
appreciates Ellen

Yes so do we And theres about as much prospect of his marrying her
Rufus its pretty hard Shes just in the mood to be taken with him
but she wont let herself because she knows its of no use That Miss
Rasmith has been telling her how much he is run after and I could
see that that settled it for Ellen as plainly as if she said so More
plainly for theres enough of the girl in her to make her say one thing
when she means another She was just saying she was sick of him and
never wanted to speak to him again when he came up and asked her to
walk and she went with him instantly I knew what she meant She wasnt
going to let him suppose that anything Miss Rasmith had said was going
to change her

Well then said the judge I dont see what youre scared at

Im not SCARED But oh Rufus It cant come to anything There isnt
time An hysterical hope trembled in her asseveration of despair that
made him smile

I guess if times all thats wanted

He is going to get off at Boulogne

Well we can get off there too

Rufus if you dare to think of such a thing

I dont But Europe isnt so big but what he can find us again if he
wants to

Ah if he wants to

Ellen seemed to have let her mother take her languor below along with
the shawls she had given her Buttoned into a close jacket and skirted
short for the sea she pushed against the breeze at Breckons elbow with
a vigor that made him look his surprise at her Girllike she took it
that something was wrong with her dress and ran herself over with an
uneasy eye

Then he explained I was just thinking how much you were like Miss
Lottieif youll excuse my being so personal And it never struck me
before

I didnt suppose we looked alike said Ellen

No certainly I shouldnt have taken you for sisters And yet just
now I felt that you were like her You seem so much stronger this
morningperhaps its that the voyage is doing you good Shall you be
sorry to have it end

Shall you Thats the way Lottie would answer

Breckon laughed Yes it is I shall be very sorry I should be willing
to have it rough again it that would make it longer I liked its being
rough We had it to ourselves He had not thought how that sounded but
if it sounded particular she did not notice it

She merely said I was surprised not to be seasick too

And should you be willing to have it rough again

You wouldnt see anything more of your friends then

Ah yes Miss Rasmith She is a great talker Did you find her
interesting

She was very interesting

Yes What did she talk about

Ellen realized the fact too late to withhold Why about you

And was that what made her interesting

Now what would Lottie say to such a thing as that asked Ellen
gayly

Something terribly cutting Im afraid But dont you From you I dont
want to believe I deserve it no matter what Miss Rasmith said me

Oh she didnt say anything very bad Unless you mind being a universal
favorite

Well it makes a man out rather silly

But you cant help that

Now you remind me of Miss Lottie again

But I didnt mean that said Ellen blushing and laughing I hope you
wouldnt think I could be so pert

I wouldnt think anything that wasnt to your praise said Breckon
and a pause ensued after which the words he added seemed tame and flat
I suspect Miss Rasmith has been idealizing the situation At any rate
I shouldnt advise you to trust her report implicitly Im at the head
of a society you know ethical or sociological or altruistic whatever
you choose to call it which hasnt any very definite object of worship
and yet meets every Sunday for a sort of worship and I have to be in
the pulpit So you see

Ellen said I think I understand with a temptation to smile at the
ruefulness of his appeal

Breckon laughed for her Thats the mischief and the absurdity of it
But it isnt so bad as it seems Theyre really most of them hardheaded
people and those that are not couldnt make a fool of a man that nature
hadnt begun with Still Im not very well satisfied with my work among
themthat is Im not satisfied with myself He was talking soberly
enough and he did not find that she was listening too seriously Im
going away to see whether I shall come back He looked at her to make
sure that she had taken his meaning and seemed satisfied that she had
Im not sure that Im fit for any sort of ministry and I may find the
winter in England trying to find out I was at school in England you
know

Ellen confessed that she had not known that

Yes I suppose thats what made me seem so Englishy the first day to
Miss Lottie as she called it But Im straight enough American as far
as parentage goes Do you think you will be in Englandlater

I dont know If poppa gets too homesick we will go back in the fall

Miss Kenton said the young man abruptly will you let me tell you
how much I admire and revere your father

Tears came into her eyes and her throat swelled But you dont know
she begun and then she stopped

I have been wanting to submit something to his judgment but Ive been
afraid I might seem to be fishing for his favor

Poppa wouldnt think anything that was unjust said Ellen gravely

Ah Breckon laughed I suspect that I should rather have him unjust
I wish youd tell me what he would think

But I dont know what it is she protested with a reflected smile

I was in hopes Miss Rasmith might have told you Well it is simply
this and you will see that Im not quite the universal favorite shes
been making you fancy me There is a rift in my lute a schism in my
little society which is so little that I could not have supposed
there was enough of it to break in two There are some who think their
lecturerfor thats what I amount toought to be an older if not
a graver man They are in the minority but theyre in the right Im
afraid and thats why I happen to be here telling you all this Its
a question of whether I ought to go back to New York or stay in London
where theres been a faint call for me He saw the girl listening
devoutly with that flattered look which a serious girl cannot keep out
of her face when a man confides a serious matter to her I might
safely promise to be older but could I keep my word if I promised to
be graver Thats the point If I were a Calvinist I might hold fast by
faith and fight it out with that or if I were a Catholic I could
cast myself upon the strength of the Church and triumph in spite of
temperament Then it wouldnt matter whether I was grave or gay it
might be even better if I were gay But he went on in terms which
doubtless were not then for the first time formulated in his mind
being merely the leader of a sort of forlorn hope in the Divine
Goodness perhaps I have no right to be so cheerful

The note of a sad irony in his words appealed to such indignation for
him in Ellen as she never felt for herself But she only said I dont
believe Poppa could take that in the wrong way if you told him

Breckon stared Yes your father What would he say

I cant tell you But Im sure he would know what you meant

And you he pursued what should YOU say

I I never thought about such a thing You mustnt ask me if youre
serious and if youre not

But I am I am deeply serious I would like to know how the case
strikes you I shall be so grateful if you will tell me

Im sorry I cant Mr Breckon Why dont you ask poppa

No I see now I shant be able I feel too much after telling you
as if I had been posing The reality has gone out of it all And Im
ashamed

You mustnt be she said quietly and she added I suppose it would
be like a kind of defeat if you didnt go back

I shouldnt care for the appearance of defeat he said courageously
The great question is whether somebody else wouldnt be of more use in
my place

Nobody could be said she in a sort of impassioned absence and then
coming to herself I mean they wouldnt think so I dont believe

Then you advise

No no I cant I dont Im not fit to have an opinion about such a
thing it would be crazy But poppa

They were at the door of the gangway and she slipped within and left
him His nerves tingled and there was a glow in his breast It was
sweet to have surprised that praise from her though he could not have
said why he should value the praise or a girl of her open ignorance and
inexperience in everything that would have qualified her to judge him
But he found himself valuing it supremely and wonderingly wishing to be
worthy of it




XVII

Ellen discovered her father with a book in a distant corner of the
diningsaloon which he preferred to the deck or the library for his
reading in such intervals as the stewards laying and cleaning the
tables left him unmolested in it She advanced precipitately upon him
and stood before him in an excitement which though he lifted his dazed
eyes to it from his page he was not entirely aware of till afterwards
Then he realized that her cheeks were full of color and her eyes of
light and that she panted as if she had been running when she spoke

Poppa she said there is something that Mr Breckon wants to speak
to youto ask you about He has asked me but I want you to see him
for I think he had better tell you himself

While he still stared at her she was as suddenly gone as she had come
and he remained with his book which the meaning had as suddenly left
There was no meaning in her words except as he put it into them and
after he had got it in he struggled with it in a sort of perfunctory
incredulity It was not impossible it chiefly seemed so because
it seemed too good to be true and the more he pondered it the more
possible if not probable it became He could not be safe with it till
he had submitted it to his wife and he went to her while he was sure of
repeating Ellens words without varying from them a syllable

To his astonishment Mrs Kenton was instantly convinced Why of
course she said it cant possibly mean anything else Why should it
be so very surprising The time hasnt been very long but theyve been
together almost every moment and he was taken with her from the very
beginningI could see that Put on your other coat she said as she
dusted the collar of the coat the judge was wearing Hell be looking
you up at once I cant say that its unexpected and she claimed a
prescience in the matter which all her words had hitherto denied

Kenton did not notice her inconsistency If it were not so exactly
what I wished he said I dont know that I should be surprised at
it myself Sarah if I had been trying to imagine any one for Ellen I
couldnt have dreamed of a person better suited to her than this young
man Hes everything that I could wish him to be Ive seen the pleasure
and comfort she took in his way from the first moment He seemed to make
her forgetDo you suppose she has forgotten that miserable wretch Do
you think

If she hadnt could she be letting him come to speak to you I dont
believe she ever really cared for Bittridgeor not after he began
flirting with Mrs Uphill She had no shrinking from the names which
Kenton avoided with disgust The only question for you is to consider
what you shall say to Mr Breckon

Say to him Why of course if Ellen has made up her mind theres only
one thing I can say

Indeed there is He ought to know all about that disgusting Bittridge
business and you have got to tell him

Sarah I couldnt It is too humiliating How would it do to refer him
toYou could manage that part so much better I dont see how I could
keep it from seeming an indelicate betrayal of the poor child

Perhaps shes told him herself Mrs Kenton provisionally suggested

The judge eagerly caught at the notion Do you think so It would be
like her Ellen would wish him to know everything

He stopped and his wife could see that he was trembling with
excitement We must find out I will speak to Ellen

Andyou dont think Id better have the talk with him first

Certainly not

Why Rufus You were not going to look him up

No he hesitated but she could see that some such thing had been on
his mind

Surely she said you must be crazy But she had not the heart to
blight his joy with sarcasm and perhaps no sarcasm would have blighted
it

I merely wondered what I had better say in case he spoke to me before
you saw Ellenthats all Sarah I couldnt have believed that anything
could please me so much But it does seem as if it were the assurance
of Ellens happiness and she has deserved it poor child If ever
there was a dutiful and loving daughterat least before that wretched
affairshe was one

She has been a good girl Mrs Kenton stoically admitted

And they are very well matched Ellen is a cultivated woman He never
could have cause to blush for her either her mind or her manners
in any circle of society she would do him credit under any and all
circumstances If it were Lottie

Lottie is all right said her mother in resentment of his preference
but she could not help smiling at it Dont you be foolish about Ellen
I approve of Mr Breckon as much as you do But its her prettiness and
sweetness thats taken his fancy and not her wisdom if shes got him

If shes got him

Well you know what I mean Im not saying she hasnt Dear knows I
dont want to I feel just as you do about it I think its the greatest
piece of good fortune coming on top of all our trouble with her I
couldnt have imagined such a thing

He was instantly appeased Are you going to speak with Ellen he
radiantly inquired

I will see Theres no especial hurry is there

Only if he should happen to meet me

You can keep out of his way I reckon Or You can put him off
somehow

Yes Kenton returned doubtfully Dont he added be too blunt
with Ellen You know she didnt say anything explicit to me

I think I will know how to manage Mr Kenton

Yes of course Sarah Im not saying that

Breckon did not apparently try to find the judge before lunch and
at table he did not seem especially devoted to Ellen in her fathers
jealous eyes He joked Lottie and exchanged those passages or repartee
with her in which she did not mind using a bludgeon when she had not
a rapier at hand it is doubtful if she was very sensible of the
difference Ellen sat by in passive content smiling now and then and
Boyne carried on a dignified conversation with Mr Pogis whom he
had asked to lunch at his table and who listened with one ear to the
vigorous retorts of Lottie in her combat with Breckon

The judge witnessed it all with a grave displeasure more and more
painfully apparent to his wife She could see the impatience the
gathering misgiving in his face and she perceived that she must not
let this come to conscious dissatisfaction with Breckon she knew her
husband capable of indignation with trifling which would complicate the
situation if it came to that She decided to speak with Ellen as soon
as possible and she meant to follow her to her stateroom when they
left the table But fate assorted the pieces in the game differently
Boyne walked over to the place where Miss Rasmith was sitting with
her mother Lottie and Mr Pogis went off to practise duets together
terrible fourhanded torments under which the piano presently clamored
and Ellen stood for a moment talked to by Mr Breckon who challenged
her then for a walk on deck and with whom she went away smiling

Mrs Kenton appealed with the reflection of the girls happiness in her
face to the frowning censure in her husbands but Kenton spoke first
What does he mean he demanded darkly If he is making a fool of her
hell find that that game cant be played twice with impunity Sarah I
believe I should choke him

Mr Kenton she gasped and she trembled in fear of him even while
she kept herself with difficulty from shaking him for his folly Dont
say such a thing Cant you see that they want to talk it over If he
hasnt spoken to you its because he wants to know how you took what
she said Seeing the effect of these arguments she pursued Will you
never have any sense I will speak to Ellen the very minute I get her
alone and you have just got to wait Dont you suppose its hard for
me too Have I got nothing to bear

Kenton went silently back to his book which he took with him to the
readingroom where from time to time his wife came to him and reported
that Ellen and Breckon were still walking up and down together or that
they were sitting down talking or were forward looking over at the
prow or were watching the deckpassengers dancing Her husband received
her successive advices with relaxing interest and when she had brought
the last she was aware that the affair was entirely in her hands with
all the responsibility After the gay parting between Ellen and Breckon
which took place late in the afternoon she suffered an interval to
elapse before she followed the girl down to her stateroom She found
her lying in her berth with shining eyes and glad red cheeks she was
smiling to herself

That is right Ellen her mother said You need rest after your long
tramp

Im not tired We were sitting down a good deal I didnt think how
late it was Im ever so much better Wheres Lottie

Off somewhere with that young Englishman said Mrs Kenton as if that
were of no sort of consequence Ellen she added abruptly trying
within a tremulous smile to hide her eagerness what is this that Mr
Breckon wants to talk with your father about

Mr Breckon With poppa

Yes certainly You told him this morning that Mr Breckon

Oh Oh yes said Ellen as if recollecting something that had slipped
her mind He wants poppa to advise him whether to go back to his
congregation in New York or not

Mrs Kenton sat in the corner of the sofa next the door looking into
the girls face on the pillow as she lay with her arms under her head
Tears of defeat and shame came into her eyes and she could not see the
girls light nonchalance in adding

But he hasnt got up his courage yet He thinks hell ask him after
dinner He says he doesnt want poppa to think hes posing I dont know
what he means

Mrs Kenton did not speak at once Her bitterest mortification was not
for herself but for the simple and tender fathersoul which had been
so tried already She did not know how he would bear it the
disappointment and the cruel hurt to his pride But she wanted to fall
on her knees in thankfulness that he had betrayed himself only to her

She started in sudden alarm with the thought Where is he nowMr
Breckon

Hes gone with Boyne down into the baggageroom

Mrs Kenton sank back in her corner aware now that she would not have
had the strength to go to her husband even to save him from the awful
disgrace of giving himself away to Breckon And was that all she
faltered

All

That he wanted to speak to your father about

She must make irrefragably sure for Kentons sake that she was not
misunderstanding

Why of course What else Why momma what are you crying about

Im not crying child Just some foolishness of your fathers He
understoodhe thought Mrs Kenton began to laugh hysterically But
you know how ridiculous he is and he supposedNo I wont tell you

It was not necessary The girls mind perhaps because it was imbued
already with the subject had possessed itself of what filled her
mothers She dropped from the elbow on which she had lifted herself
and turned her face into the pillow with a long wail of shame




XVIII

Mrs Kentons difficulties in setting her husband right were
indefinitely heightened by the suspicion that the most unsuspicious of
men fell into concerning Breckon Did Breckon suppose that the matter
could be turned off in that way he stupidly demanded and when he was
extricated from this error by his wifes representation that Breckon
had not changed at all but had never told Ellen that he wished to speak
with him of anything but his returning to his society Kenton still
could not accept the fact He would have contended that at least the
other matter must have been in Breckons mind and when he was beaten
from this position and convinced that the meaning they had taken from
Ellens words had never been in any mind but their own he fell into
humiliation so abject that he could hide it only by the hauteur with
which he carried himself towards Breckon when they met at dinner He
would scarcely speak to the young man Ellen did not come to the
table Lottie and Boyne and their friend Mr Pogis were dining with the
Rasmiths and Mrs Kenton had to be as she felt cringingly kind to
Breckon in explaining just the sort of temporary headache that kept
her eldest daughter away He was more than ordinarily sympathetic
and polite but he was manifestly bewildered by Kentons behavior He
refused an hilarious invitation from Mrs Rasmith when he rose from
table to stop and have his coffee with her on his way out of the
saloon His old adorer explained that she had ordered a small bottle of
champagne in honor of its being the night before they were to get into
Boulogne and that he ought to sit down and help her keep the young
people straight Julia she brokenly syllabled with the gay beverage
bubbling back into her throat was not the least use she was worse than
any Julia did not look it in the demure regard which she bent upon her
amusing mother and Breckon persisted in refusing He said he thought
he might safely leave them to Boyne and Mrs Rasmith said into her
handkerchief Oh yes Boyne and pressed Boynes sleeve with her
knobbed and jewelled fingers

It was evident where most of the small bottle had gone but Breckon was
none the cheerfuller for the spectacle of Mrs Rasmith He could not
have a moments doubt as to the sort of work he had been doing in New
York if she were an effect of it and he turned his mind from the sad
certainty back to the more important inquiry as to what offence his wish
to advise with Judge Kenton could have conveyed Ellen had told him in
the afternoon that she had spoken with her father about it and she had
not intimated any displeasure or reluctance on him but apparently he
had decided not to suffer himself to be approached

It might be as well Breckon had not been able to convince himself that
his proposal to consult Judge Kenton was not a pose He had flashes
of owning that it was contemplated merely as a means of ingratiating
himself with Ellen Now as he found his way up and down among the empty
steamerchairs he was aware at the bottom of his heart of not
caring in the least for Judge Kentons repellent bearing except as it
possibly or impossibly reflected some mood of hers He could not make
out her not coming to dinner the headache was clearly an excuse for
some reason she did not wish to see him he argued with the egotism of
his condition

The logic of his conclusion was strengthened at breakfast by her
continued absence and this time Mrs Kenton made no apologies for her
The judge was a shade less severe or else Breckon did not put himself
so much in the way to be withheld as he had the night before Boyne and
Lottie carried on a sort of muted scrap unrebuked by their mother who
seemed too much distracted in some tacit trouble to mind them From
time to time Breckon found her eyes dwelling upon him wonderingly
entreatingly she dropped them if she caught his and colored

In the afternoon it was early evident that they were approaching
Boulogne The hatch was opened and the sailors began getting up the
baggage of the passengers who were going to disembark It seemed a long
time for everybody till the steamer got in those going ashore sat on
their handbaggage for an hour before the tug came up to take them
off Mr Pogis was among them he had begun in the forenoon to mark
the approaching separation between Lottie and himself by intervals of
unmistakable withdrawal Another girl might have cared but Lottie did
not care for her failure to get a rise out of him by her mockingly
varied Oh I say and Well rather In the growth of his dignified
reserve Mr Pogis was indifferent to jeers By whatever tradition
of what would or would not do he was controlled in relinquishing her
acquaintance or whether it was in obedience to some imperative ideal
or some fearful domestic influence subtly making itself felt from the
coasts of his native island or some fine despair of equalling the
imagined grandeur of Lotties social state in Tuskingum by anything he
could show her in England it was certain that he was ending with Lottie
then and there At the same time he was carefully defining himself from
the Rasmiths with whom he must land He had his stateroom things put
at an appreciable distance where he did not escape a final stab from
Lottie

Oh do give me a rose out of that she entreated in travestied
imploring as he stood looking at a withered bouquet which the steward
had brought up with his rugs

Im takin it home he explained coldly

And I want to take a rose back to New York I want to give it to a
friend of mine there

Mr Pogis hesitated Then he asked A man Well rather said
Lottie

He answered nothing but looked definitively down at the flowers in his
hand

Oh I say Lottie exulted

Boyne remained fixed in fealty to the Rasmiths with whom Breckon was
also talking as Mrs Kenton came up with the judge She explained how
sorry her daughter Ellen was at not being able to say goodbye she was
still not at all well and the ladies received her excuses with polite
patience Mrs Rasmith said she did not know what they should do without
Boyne and Miss Rasmith put her arm across his shoulders and pulled him
up to her and implored Oh give him to me Mrs Kenton

Boyne stole an ashamed look at his mother and his father said with
an unbending to Breckon which must have been the effect of severe
expostulation from Mrs Kenton I suppose you and the ladies will go to
Paris together

Why no Breckon said and he added with mounting confusion II
had arranged to keep on to Rotterdam I was going to mention it

Keep on to Rotterdam Mrs Rasmiths eyes expressed the greatest
astonishment

Why of course mother said her daughter Dont you know Boyne told
us

Boyne after their parting seized the first chance of assuring his
mother that he had not told Miss Rasmith that for he had not known it
and he went so far in her condemnation to wonder how she could say such
a thing His mother said it was not very nice and then suggested that
perhaps she had heard it from some one else and thought it was he
She acquitted him of complicity with Miss Rasmith in forbearing to
contradict her and it seemed to her a fitting time to find out from
Boyne what she honestly could about the relation of the Rasmiths to Mr
Breckon It was very little beyond their supposition which every one
else had shared that he was going to land with them at Boulogne and
he must have changed his mind very suddenly Boyne had not heard the
Rasmiths speak of it Miss Rasmith never spoke of Mr Breckon at all
but she seemed to want to talk of Ellen she was always asking about
her and what was the matter with her and how long she had been sick

Boyne said his mother with a pang you didnt tell her anything
about Ellen

Momma said the boy in such evident abhorrence of the idea that she
rested tranquil concerning it She paid little attention to what Boyne
told her otherwise of the Rasmiths Her own horizon were so limited that
she could not have brought home to herself within them that wandering
life the Rasmiths led from climate to climate and sensation to
sensation with no stay so long as the annually made in New York where
they sometimes passed months enough to establish themselves in giving
and taking tea in a circle of kindred nomads She conjectured as
ignorantly as Boyne himself that they were very rich and it would
not have enlightened her to know that the mother was the widow of a
California politician whom she had married in the sort of middle period
following upon her less mortuary survival of Miss Rasmiths father
whose name was not Rasmith

What Mrs Kenton divined was that they had wanted to get Breckon and
that so far as concerned her own interest in him they had wanted to
get him away from Ellen In her innermost selfconfidences she did not
permit herself the notion that Ellen had any right to him but still it
was a relief to have them off the ship and to have him left Of all
the witnesses of the fact she alone did not find it awkward Breckon
himself found it very awkward He did not wish to be with the
Rasmiths but he found it uncomfortable not being with them under
the circumstances and he followed them ashore in tingling reveries of
explanation and apology He had certainly meant to get off at Boulogne
and when he had suddenly and tardily made up his mind to keep on to
Rotterdam he had meant to tell them as soon as he had the labels on his
baggage changed He had not meant to tell them why he had changed his
mind and he did not tell them now in these tingling reveries He did
not own the reason in his secret thoughts for it no longer seemed a
reason it no longer seemed a cause He knew what the Rasmiths would
think but he could easily make that right with his conscience at
least by parting with the Kentons at Rotterdam and leaving them to
find their unconducted way to any point they chose beyond He separated
himself uncomfortably from them when the tender had put off with
her passengers and the ship had got under way again and went to the
smokingroom while the judge returned to his book and Mrs Kenton
abandoned Lottie to her own devices and took Boyne aside for her
apparently fruitless inquiries

They were not really so fruitless but that at the end of them she could
go with due authority to look up her husband She gently took his book
from him and shut it up Now Mr Kenton she began if you dont go
right straight and find Mr Breckon and talk with him II dont know
what I will do You must talk to him

About Ellen the judge frowned

No certainly not Talk with him about anything that interests you Be
pleasant to him Cant you see that hes going on to Rotterdam on our
account

Then I wish he wasnt Theres no use in it

No matter Its polite in him and I want you to show him that you
appreciate it

Now see here Sarah said the judge if you want him shown that we
appreciate his politeness why dont you do it yourself

I Because it would look as if you were afraid to It would look as if
we meant something by it

Well I am afraid and thats just what Im afraid of I declare my
heart comes into my mouth whenever I think what an escape we had I
think of it whenever I look at him and I couldnt talk to him without
having that in my mind all the time No women can manage those things
better If you believe he is going along on our account so as to help
us see Holland and to keep us from getting into scrapes youre the
one to make it up to him I dont care what you say to show him our
gratitude I reckon we will get into all sorts of trouble if were left
to ourselves But if you think hes stayed because he wants to be with
Ellen and

Oh I dont KNOW what I think And thats silly I cant talk to him
Im afraid itll seem as if we wanted to flatter him and goodness knows
we dont want to Or yes we do Id give anything if it was true
Rufus do you suppose he did stay on her account My oh my If I could
only think so Wouldnt it be the best thing in the world for the poor
child and for all of us I never saw anybody that I liked so much But
its too good to be true

Hes a nice fellow but I dont think hes any too good for Ellen

Im not saying he is The great thing is that hes good enough and
gracious knows what will happen if she meets some other worthless
fellow and gets befooled with him Or if she doesnt take a fancy to
some one and goes back to Tuskingum without seeing any one else she
likes there is that awful wretch and when she hears what Dick did to
himshes just wrongheaded enough to take up with him again to make
amends to him Oh dear oh dear I know Lottie will let it out to her
yet

The judge began threateningly You tell Lottie from me

What said the girl herself who had seen her father and mother
talking together in a remote corner of the musicroom and had stolen
lightfootedly upon them just at this moment

Lottie child said her mother undismayed at Lotties arrival in her
larger anxiety I wish you would try and be agreeable to Mr Breckon
Now that hes going on with us to Holland I dont want him to think
were avoiding him

Why

Oh because

Because you want to get him for Ellen

Dont be impudent said her father You do as your mother bids you

Be agreeable to that old Breckon I think I see myself Id sooner
read Im going to get a book now She left them as abruptly as she had
come upon them and ran across to the bookcase where she remained two
stepping and peering through the glass doors at the literature within
in unaccustomed question concerning it

Shes a case said the judge looking at her not only with relenting
but with the pride in her sufficiency for all the exigencies of life
which he could not feel in Ellen She can take care of herself

Oh yes Mrs Kenton sadly assented I dont think anybody will ever
make a fool of Lottie

Its a great deal more likely to be the other way her father
suggested

I think Lottie is conscientious Mrs Kenton protested She wouldnt
really fool with a man

No shes a good girl the judge owned

Its girls like Ellen who make the trouble and the care They are too
good and you have to think some evil in this world Well She rose and
gave her husband back his book

Do you know where Boyne is

No Do you want him to be pleasant to Mr Breckon

Somebody has got to But it would be ridiculous if nobody but Boyne
was

She did not find Boyne after no very exhaustive search and the boy was
left to form his bearing towards Breckon on the behavior of the rest of
his family As this continued helplessly constrained both in his father
and mother and voluntarily repellent in Lottie Boyne decided upon a
blend of conduct which left Breckon in greater and greater doubt of his
wisdom in keeping on to Rotterdam There was no good reason which he
would have been willing to give himself from the beginning It had been
an impulse suddenly coming upon him in the baggageroom where he had
gone to get something out of his trunk and where he had decided to
have the label of his baggage changed from the original destination at
Boulogne to the final port of the steamers arrival When this was once
done he was sorry but he was ashamed to have the label changed back
The most assignable motive for his act was his reluctance to go on
to Paris with the Rasmiths or rather with Mrs Rasmith for with her
daughter who was not a bad fellow one could always manage He was
quite aware of being safely in his own hands against any design of Mrs
Rasmiths but her machinations humiliated him for her he hated to see
her going through her manoeuvres and he could not help grieving for her
failures with a sort of impersonal sympathy all the more because he
disliked her as little as he respected her

The motive which he did not assign to himself was that which probably
prevailed with him though in the last analysis it was as selfish
no doubt as the one he acknowledged Ellen Kenton still piqued his
curiosity still touched his compassion He had so far from exhausted
his wish or his power to befriend her to help her that he had still a
wholly unsatisfied longing to console her especially when she drooped
into that listless attitude she was apt to take with her face fallen
and her hands let lie the back of one in the palm of the other in
her lap It was possibly the vision of this following him to the
baggageroom when he went to open his trunk that as much as anything
decided him to have the label changed on his baggage but he did not own
it then and still less did he own it now when he found himself quite
on his own hands for his pains

He felt that for some reason the Kentons were all avoiding him Ellen
indeed did not take part against him unless negatively for she had
appeared neither at lunch nor at dinner as the vessel kept on its way
after leaving Boulogne and when he ventured to ask for her Mrs Kenton
answered with embarrassment that she was not feeling very well He asked
for her at lunch but not at dinner and when he had finished that meal
he went on the promenadedeck and walked forlornly up and down feeling
that he had been a fool

Mrs Kenton went below to her daughters room and found Ellen there
on the sofa with her book shut on her thumb at the place where the
twilight had failed her

Ellen dear her mother said arent you feeling well

Yes Im well enough said the girl sensible of a leading in the
question Why

Oh nothing Onlyonly I cant make your father behave naturally with
Mr Breckon Hes got his mind so full of that mistake we both came so
near making that he cant think of anything else Hes so sheepish
about it that he can hardly speak to him or even look at him and I must
confess that I dont do much better You know I dont like to put myself
forward where your father is and if I did really I dont believe I
could make up my mouth to say anything I did want Lottie to be nice
to him but Lottie dislikes him so And even Boynewell it wouldnt
matter about Boyne if he didnt seem to be carrying out a sort of
family planBoyne barely answers him when he speaks to him I dont
know what he can think Ellen was a good listener and Mrs Kenton
having begun did not stop till she had emptied the bag I just know
that he didnt get off at Boulogne because he wanted to stay on with us
and thought he could be useful to us at The Hague and everywhere and
here were acting as ungratefully Why were not even commonly polite
to him and I know he feels it I know that hes hurt

Ellen rose and stood before the glass into which he asked of her
mothers reflected face while she knotted a fallen coil of hair into
its place Where is he

I dont know He went on deck somewhere

Ellen put on her hat and pinned it and put on her jacket and buttoned
it Then she started towards the door Her mother made way for her
faltering What are you going to do Ellen

I am going to do right

Dontcatch cold her mother called after her figure vanishing down
the corridor but the warning couched in these terms had really no
reference to the weather

The girls impulse was one of those effects of the weak will in her
which were apt to leave her short of the fulfilment of a purpose It
carried her as her as the promenade which she found empty and she went
and leaned upon the rail and looked out over the sorrowful North Sea
which was washing darkly away towards where the gloomy sunset had been

Steps from the other side of the ship approached hesitated towards her
and then arrested themselves She looked round

Why Miss Kenton said Breckon stupidly

The sunset is over isnt it she answered

The twilight isnt Breckon stopped then he asked Wouldnt you like
to take a little walk

Yes she answered and smiled fully upon him He had never known
before how radiant a smile she lead

Better have my arm Its getting rather dark

Well She put her hand on his arm and he felt it tremble there while
she palpitated We are all so glad you could go on to Rotterdam My
mother wanted me to tell you

Oh dont speak of that said Breckon not very appositely Presently
he forced a laugh in order to add with lightness I was afraid
perhaps I had given you all some reason to regret it

She said I was afraid you would think thator momma wasand I
couldnt bear to have you

Well then I wont





XIX

Breckon had answered with gayety but his happiness was something beyond
gayety He had really felt the exclusion from the Kentons in which he
had passed the day and he had felt it the more painfully because
he liked them all It may be owned that he liked Ellen best from the
beginning and now he liked her better than ever but even in the days
exile he had not ceased to like each of them They were in their family
affection as lovable as that sort of selfishness can make people They
were very united and good to one another Lottie herself except in
her most lurid moments was good to her brother and sister and almost
invariably kind to her parents She would not Breckon saw have brooked
much meddling with her flirtations from them but as they did not offer
to meddle she had no occasion to grumble on that score She grumbled
when they asked her to do things for Ellen but she did them and though
she never did them without grumbling she sometimes did them without
being asked She was really very watchful of Ellen when it would least
have been expected and sometimes she was sweet She never was sweet
with Boyne but she was often his friend though this did not keep her
from turning upon him at the first chance to give him a little dig or
a large one for that matter As for Boyne he was a mass of helpless
sweetness though he did not know it and sometimes took himself for
an iceberg when he was merely an icecream of heroic mould He was as
helplessly sweet with Lottie as with any one and if he suffered keenly
from her treacheries and seized every occasion to repay them in kind
it was clearly a matter of conscience with him and always for the good
Their father and mother treated their squabbles very wisely Breckon
thought They ignored them as much as possible and they recognized
them without attempting to do that justice between them which would have
rankled in both their breasts

To a spectator who had been critical at first Mr and Mrs Kenton
seemed an exemplary father and mother with Ellen as well as with their
other children It is easy to be exemplary with a sick girl but they
increasingly affected Breckon as exemplary with Ellen He fancied that
they acted upon each other beneficially towards her At first he had
foreboded some tiresome boasting from the fathers tenderness and some
weak indulgence of the daughters whims from her mother but there was
either never any ground for this or else Mrs Kenton in keeping her
husband from boasting had been obliged in mere consistency to set a
guard upon her own fondness

It was not that Ellen he was more and more decided would have abused
the weakness of either if there was anything more angelic than her
patience it was her wish to be a comfort to them and between the
caprices of her invalidism to be a service It was pathetic to see her
remembering to do things for them which Boyne and Lottie had forgotten
or plainly shirked doing and to keep the fact out of sight She really
kept it out of sight with them and if she did not hide it from so close
an observer as Breckon that was more his fault than hers When her
father first launched out in her praise or the praise of her reading
the young man had dreaded a rustic prig yet she had never been a prig
but simply glad of what book she had known and meekly submissive to his
knowledge if not his taste He owned that she had a right to her taste
which he found almost always good and accounted for as instinctive in
the absence of an imaginable culture in her imaginable ambient So far
as he had glimpses of this he found it so different from anything
he had known that the modest adequacy of Mrs Kenton in the political
experiences of modern Europe as well as the clear judgments of Kenton
himself in matters sometimes beyond Breekon himself mystified him no
less than Ellens taste

Even with the growth of his respect for their intelligence and his love
of their kindliness he had not been able to keep a certain patronage
from mingling and it was not till they evinced not only entire ability
but an apparent wish to get on without his approval without his
acquaintance even that he had conceived a just sense of them The like
is apt to happen with the best of us when we are also the finest and
Breckon was not singular in coming to a due consciousness of something
valuable only in the hour of its loss He did not know that the loss was
only apparent He knew that he had made a distinct sacrifice for these
people and that when he had prepared himself to befriend them little
short of selfdevotion they showed themselves indifferent and almost
repellent In the revulsion of feeling when Ellen gave him her mothers
message and frankly offered him reparation on behalf of her whole
family he may have overdone his gratitude but he did not overdo it to
her perception They walked up and down the promenade of the Amstel
in the watery North Sea moon while bells after bells noted the hour
unheeded and when they parted for the night it was with an involuntary
pressure of hands from which she suddenly pulled hers and ran down the
corridor of her stateroom and Lotties

He stood watching the narrow space in which she had vanished and
thinking how gentle she was and how she had contrived somehow to make
him feel that now it was she who had been consoling him and trying to
interest him and amuse him He had not realized that before he had
been used to interesting and amusing her but he could not resent it
he could not resent the implication of superiority if such a thing were
possible which her kindness conveyed The question with Breckon was
whether she had walked with him so long because she wished in the hour
to make up as fully as possible for the days neglect or because she
had liked to walk up and down with him It was a question he found
keeping itself poignantly yet pleasantly in his mind after he had got
into his berth under the solidly slumberous Boyne and inclining now to
one solution and now to the other with a delicate oscillation that was
charming

The Amstel took her time to get into Rotterdam and when her passengers
had gone ashore the next forenoon the train that carried Breckon to The
Hague in the same compartment with the Kentons was in no greater hurry
It arrived with a deliberation which kept it from carrying them on to
Amsterdam before they knew it and Mrs Kenton had time to place such
parts of the wars in the Rise of the Dutch Republic as she could attach
to the names of the stations and the general features of the landscape
Boyne was occupied with improvements for the windmills and the
canalboats which did not seem to him of the quality of the Michigan
aerometers or the craft with which he was familiar on the Hudson River
and on the canal that passed through Tuskingum Lottie with respect
to the canals offered the frank observation that they smelt and in
recognizing a fact which travel almost universally ignores in Holland
she watched her chance of popping up the window between herself and
Boyne which Boyne put down with mounting rage The agriculture which
triumphed everywhere on the little halfacre plots lifted fifteen
inches above the waters of the environing ditches and the black and
white cattle everywhere attesting the immemorial Dutch ideal of a cow
were what at first occupied Kenton and he was tardily won from them to
the question of fighting over a country like that It was a concession
to his wifes impassioned interest in the overthrow of the Spaniards in
a landscape which had evidently not changed since She said it was hard
to realize that Holland was not still a republic and she was not very
patient with Breckons defence of the monarchy on the ground that the
young Queen was a very pretty girl

And she is only sixteen Boyne urged

Then she is two years too old for you said Lottie

No such thing Boyne retorted I was fifteen in June

Dear me I should never have thought it said his sister

Ellen seemed hardly to look out of the window at anything directly but
when her father bade her see this thing and that it seemed that she had
seen it already She said at last with a quiet sigh I never want to
go away

She had been a little shy of Breckon the whole morning and had kept him
asking himself whether she was sorry she had walked so long with him the
night before or having offered him due reparation for her family she
was again dropping him Now and then he put her to the test by words
explicitly directed at her and she replied with the dreamy passivity
which seemed her normal mood and in which he could fancy himself half
forgotten or remembered with an effort

In the midst of this doubt she surprised himhe reflected that she was
always surprising himby asking him how far it was from The Hague to
the sea He explained that The Hague was in the sea like all the rest
of Holland but that if she meant the shore it was no distance at all
Then she said vaguely she wished they were going to the shore Her
father asked Breckon if there was not a hotel at the beach and the
young man tried to give him a notion of the splendors of the Kurhaus
at Scheveningen of Scheveningen itself he despaired of giving any just
notion

Then we can go there said the judge ignoring Ellen in his decision
as if she had nothing to do with it

Lottie interposed a vivid preference for The Hague She had she said
had enough of the sea for one while and did not want to look at it
again till they sailed for home Boyne turned to his father as if a good
deal shaken by this reasoning and it was Mrs Kenton who carried the
day for going first to a hotel in The Hague and prospecting from there
in the direction of Scheveningen Boyne and his father could go down to
the shore and see which they liked best

I dont see what that has to do with me said Lottie No one was
alarmed by her announcement that if she did not like Scheveningen she
should stay at The Hague whatever the rest did in the event fortune
favored her going with her family

The hotel in The Hague was very pleasant with a garden behind it where
a companionable cat had found a dry spot and where Lottie found the
cat and made friends with it But she said the hotel was full of Cooks
tourists whom she recognized in spite of her lifelong ignorance of
them by a prescience derived from the conversation of Mr Pogis and
from the instinct of a society woman already rife in her She found
that she could not stay in a hotel with Cooks tourists and she
took her fathers place in the exploring party which went down to the
wateringplace in the afternoon on the top of a tramcar under the
leafy roof of the adorable avenue of trees which embowers the track to
Scheveningen She disputed Boynes impressions of the Dutch people whom
he found looking more like Americans than any foreigners he had seen
and she snubbed Breckon from his supposed charge of the party But after
the start when she declared that Ellen could not go and that it was
ridiculous for her to think of it she was very good to her and looked
after her safety and comfort with a despotic devotion

At the Kurhaus she promptly took the lead in choosing rooms for she had
no doubt of staying there after the first glance at the place and
she showed a practical sense in settling her family which at least her
mother appreciated when they were installed the next day

Mrs Kenton could not make her husband admire Lotties faculty so
readily You think it would have been better for her to sit down with
Ellen on the sand and dream of the sea she reproached him with a
tender resentment on behalf of Lottie Everybody cant dream

Yes but I wish she didnt keep awake with such a din said the judge
After all he admired Lotties judgment about the rooms and he censured
her with a sigh of relief from care as he sank back in the easychair
fronting the window that looked out on the North Sea Lottie had already
made him appreciate the view till he was almost sick of it

What is the matter said Mrs Kenton sharply Do you want to be
in Tuskingum I suppose you would rather be looking into Richards
backyard

No said the judge mildly this is very nice

It will do Ellen good every minute I dont care how much she sits on
the sands and dream Ill love to see her

The sitting on the sand was a survival of Mr Kentons preoccupations
of the seaside As a mater of fact Ellen was at that moment sitting in
one of the hooked wicker armchairs which were scattered over the whole
vast beach like a growth of monstrous mushrooms and confronting her
in cosey proximity Breckon sat equally hidden in another windstuhl Her
father and her mother were able to keep them placed among the multitude
of windstuhls by the presence of Lottie who hovered near them and
with Boyne fended off the demure wickedlooking little Scheveningen
girls On a smaller scale these were exactly like their demure
wickedlooking Scheveningen mothers and they approached with knitting
in their hands and with large stones folded in their aprons which they
had pilfered from the mole and were trying to sell for footstools The
windstuhl men and they were enemies and when Breckon bribed them to go
away the windstuhl men chased them and the little girls ran making
mouths at Boyne over their shoulders He scorned to notice them but he
was obliged to report the misconduct of Lottie who began making eyes at
the Dutch officers as soon as she could feel that Ellen was safely off
her hands She was the more exasperating and the more culpable to Boyne
because she had asked him to walk up the beach with her and had then
made the fraternal promenade a basis of operations against the Dutch
military She joined her parents in ignoring Boynes complaints and
continued to take credit for all the pleasant facts of the situation
she patronized her family as much for the table dhote at luncheon as
for the comfort of their rooms She was able to assure them that there
was not a Cooks tourist in the hotel where there seemed to be nearly
every other kind of fellowcreature At the end of the first week she
had acquaintance of as many nationalities as she could reach in their
native or acquired English in all the stages of haughty toleration
vivid intimacy and cold exhaustion She had a faculty for getting
through with people or of ceasing to have any use for them which was
perhaps her best safeguard in her adventurous flirting while the simple
aliens were still in the full tide of fancied success Lottie was sick
of them all and deep in an indiscriminate correspondence with her young
men in Tuskingum

The letters which she had invited from these while still in New York
arrived with the first of those readdressed from the judges London
banker She had more letters than all the rest of the family together
and counted a halfdozen against a poor two for her sister Mrs Kenton
cared nothing about Lotties letters but she was silently uneasy about
the two that Ellen carelessly took She wondered who could be writing to
Ellen especially in a cover bearing a handwriting altogether strange to
her

It isnt from Bittridge at any rate she said to her husband in the
speculation which she made him share I am always dreading to have her
find out what Richard did It would spoil everything Im afraid and
now everything is going so well I do wish Richard hadnt though of
course he did it for the best Who do you think has been writing to
her

Why dont you ask her

I suppose she will tell me after a while I dont like to seem to be
following her up One was from Bessie Pearl I think

Ellen did not speak of her letters to her mother and after waiting a
day or two Mrs Kenton could not refrain from asking her

Oh I forgot said Ellen I havent read them yet

Havent read them said Mrs Kenton Then after reflection she
added You are a strange girl Ellen and did not venture to say more

I suppose I thought I should have to answer them and that made me
careless But I will read them Her mother was silent and presently
Ellen added I hate to think of the past Dont you momma

It is certainly very pleasant here said Mrs Kenton cautiously
Youre enjoying yourselfI mean you seem to be getting so much
stronger

Why momma why do you talk as if I had been sick Ellen asked

I mean youre so much interested

Dont I go about everywhere like anybody Ellen pursued ignoring her
explanation

Yes you certainly do Mr Breckon seems to like going about

Ellen did not respond to the suggestion except to say We go into all
sorts of places This morning we went up on that schooner thats drawn
up on the beach and the old man who was there was very pleasant I
thought it was a wreck but Mr Breckon says they are always drawing
their ships that way up on the sand The old man was patching some
of the woodwork and he told Mr Breckonhe can speak a little
Dutchthat they were going to drag her down to the water and go fishing
as soon as he was done He seemed to think we were brother and sister
She flushed a little and then she said I believe I like the dunes as
well as anything Sometimes when those curious cold breaths come in
from the sea we climb up in the little hollows on the other side and sit
there out of the draft Everybody seems to do it

Apparently Ellen was submitting the propriety of the fact to her mother
who said Yes it seems to be quite the same as it is at home I
always supposed that it was different with young people here There is
certainly no harm in it

Ellen went on irrelevantly I like to go and look at the Scheveningen
women mending the nets on the sand back of the dunes They have such
good gossiping times They shouted to us last evening and then laughed
when they saw us watching them When they got through their work they
got up and stamped off so strong with their bare red arms folded into
their aprons and their skirts sticking out so stiff Yes I should like
to be like them

You Ellen

Yes why not

Mrs Kenton found nothing better to answer than

They were very material looking

They are very happy looking They live in the present That is what
I should like living in the present and not looking backwards or
forwards After all the present is the only life weve got isnt it

I suppose you may say it is Mrs Kenton admitted not knowing just
where the talk was leading but dreading to interrupt it

But that isnt the Scheveningen womans only ideal Their other
ideal is to keep the place clean Saturday afternoon they were all out
scrubbing the brick sidewalks and clear into the middle of the street
We were almost ashamed to walk over the nice bricks and we picked out
as many dirty places as we could find

Ellen laughed with a lighthearted gayety that was very strange to her
and Mrs Kenton as she afterwards told her husband did not know what
to think

I couldnt help wondering she said whether the poor child would
have liked to keep on living in the present a month ago

Well Im glad you didnt say so the judge answered




XX

From the easy conquest of the men who looked at her Lottie proceeded to
the subjection of the women It would have been more difficult to put
these down if the process had not been so largely so almost entirely
subjective As it was Lottie exchanged snubs with many ladies of the
continental nationalities who were never aware of having offered or
received offence In some cases when they fearlessly ventured to speak
with her they behaved very amiable and seemed to find her conduct
sufficiently gracious in return In fact she was approachable enough
and had no shame before Boyne in dismounting from the high horse which
she rode when alone with him and meeting these ladies on foot at least
halfway She made several of them acquainted with her mother who
after a timorous reticence found them very conversable with a range of
topics however that shocked her American sense of decorum One
Dutch lady talked with such manly freedom and with such untrammelled
intimacy that she was obliged to send Boyne and Lottie about their
business upon an excuse that was not apparent to the Dutch lady She
only complimented Mrs Kenton upon her children and their devotion
to each other and when she learned that Ellen was also her daughter
ventured the surmise she was not long married

It isnt her husband Mrs Kenton explained with inward trouble
Its just a gentleman that came over with us and she went with her
trouble to her own husband as soon as she could

Im afraid it isnt the custom to go around alone with young men as
much as Ellen thinks she suggested

He ought to know said the judge I dont suppose he would if it
wasnt

That is true Mrs Kenton owned and for the time she put her
misgivings away

So long as we do nothing wrong the judge decided I dont see why we
should not keep to our own customs

Lottie says theyre not ours in New York

Well we are not in New York now

They had neither of them the heart to interfere with Ellens happiness
for after all Breckon was careful enough of the appearances and it
was only his being constantly with Ellen that suggested the Dutch ladys
surmise In fact the range of their wanderings was not beyond the
dunes though once they went a little way on one of the neatly bricked
country roads that led towards The Hague As yet there had been no
movement in any of the party to see the places that lie within such easy
tramreach of The Hague and the hoarded interest of the past in
their keeping Ellen chose to dwell in the actualities which were
an enlargement of her own present and Lotties active spirit found
employment enough in the amusements at the Kurhaus She shopped in the
little bazars which make a Saratoga under the colonnades fronting two
sides of the great space before the hotel and she formed a critical
and exacting taste in music from a constant attendance at the afternoon
concerts it is true that during the winter in New York she had cast
forever behind her the unsophisticated ideals of Tuskingum in the art
so that from the first she was able to hold the famous orchestra that
played in the Kurhaus concertroom up to the highest standard She had
no use for anybody who had any use for ragtime and she was terribly
severe with a young American primarily of Boynes acquaintance who
tried to make favor with her by asking about the latest coonsongs She
took the highest ethical ground with him about tickets in a charitable
lottery which he had bought from the portier but could not move him on
the lower level which he occupied He offered to give her the picture
which was the chief prize in case he won it and she assured him
beforehand that she should not take it She warned Boyne against him
under threats of exposure to their mother as not a good influence but
one afternoon when the young Queen of Holland came to the concert with
the queenmother Lottie cast her prejudices to the winds in accepting
the places which the wicked fellowcountryman offered Boyne and herself
when they had failed to get any where they could see the queens as the
Dutch called them

The hotel was draped with flags and banked with flowers about the
main entrance where the queens were to arrive and the guests massed
themselves in a dense lane for them to pass through Lottie could
not fail to be one of the foremost in this array and she was able
to decide when the queens had passed that the younger would not be
considered a more than average pretty girl in America and that she was
not very well dressed They had all stood within five feet of her and
Boyne had appropriated one of the prettiest of the pretty bends which
the gracious young creature made to right and left and had responded to
it with an empressement which he hoped had not been a sacrifice of his
republican principles

During the concert he sat with his eyes fixed upon the Queen where she
sat in the royal box with her mother and her ladies behind her and
wondered and blushed to wonder if she had noticed him when he bowed or
if his chivalric devotion in applauding her when the audience rose to
receive her had been more apparent than that of others whether it had
seemed the heroic act of setting forth at the head of her armies to
beat back a German invasion which it had essentially been with his
instantaneous return as victor and the Queens abdication and adoption
of republican principles under conviction of his reasoning and her
idolized consecration as the first chief of the Dutch republic His
cheeks glowed and he quaked at heart lest Lottie should surprise his
thoughts and expose them to that sarcastic acquaintance who proved to
be a medical student resting at Scheveningen from the winters courses
and clinics in Vienna He had already got on to many of Boynes curves
and had sacrilegiously suggested the Queen of Holland when he found him
feeding his fancy on the modern heroical romances he advised him as an
American adventurer to compete with the European princes paying court
to her So thin a barrier divided that malign intelligence from Boynes
most secret dreams that he could never feel quite safe from him and yet
he was always finding himself with him now that he was separated from
Miss Rasmith and Mr Breckon was taken up so much with Ellen On the
ship he could put many things before Mr Breckon which must here perish
in his breast or suffer the blight of this Mr Trannels raillery The
student sat near the Kentons at table and he was no more reverent of
the judges modest convictions than of Boynes fantastic preoccupations
The worst of him was that you could not help liking him he had a
fascination which the boy felt while he dreaded him and now and then
he did something so pleasant that when he said something unpleasant you
could hardly believe it

At the end of the concert when he rose and stood with all the rest
while the royal party left their box and the orchestra played the Dutch
national hymn he said in a loud whisper to Boyne Nows your time
my boy Hurry out and hand her into her carriage

Boyne fairly reeled at the words which translated a passage of the wild
drama playing itself in his brain and found little support in
bidding his tormentor Shut up The retort rude as it was seemed
insufficient but Boyne tried in vain to think of something else
He tried to punish him by separating Lottie from him but failed as
signally in that She went off with him and sat in a windstuhl facing
his the rest of the afternoon with every effect of carrying on

Boyne was helpless with his mother against it when he appealed to her
to let him go and tell Lottie that she wanted her Mrs Kenton said that
she saw no harm in it that Ellen was sitting in like manner with Mr
Breckon

Mr Breckon is very different and Ellen knows how to behave
he urged but his mother remained unmoved or was too absent about
something to take any interest in the matter In fact she was again
unhappy about Ellen though she put on such an air of being easy about
her Clearly so far as her maternal surmise could fathom the case Mr
Breckon was more and more interested in Ellen and it was evident that
the child was interested in him The situation was everything that was
acceptable to Mrs Kenton but she shuddered at the cloud which hung
over it and which might any moment involve it Again and again she had
made sure that Lottie had given Ellen no hint of Richards illadvised
vengeance upon Bittridge but it was not a thing that could be kept
always and the question was whether it could be kept till Ellen had
accepted Mr Breckon and married him This was beyond the question of
his asking her to do so but it was so much more important that Mrs
Kenton was giving it her attention first quite out of the order of
time Besides she had every reason as she felt to count upon the
event Unless he was trifling with Ellen far more wickedly than
Bittridge he was in love with her and in Mrs Kentons simple
experience and philosophy of life being in love was briefly preliminary
to marrying If she went with her anxieties to her husband she had
first to reduce him from a buoyant optimism concerning the affair before
she could get him to listen seriously When this was accomplished he
fell into such despair that she ended in lifting him up and supporting
him with hopes that she did not feel herself What they were both united
in was the conviction that nothing so good could happen in the world
but they were equally united in the old American tradition that they
must not lift a finger to secure this supreme good for their child

It did not seem to them that leaving the young people constantly to
themselves was doing this They interfered with Ellen now neither more
nor less than they had interfered with her as to Bittridge or than
they would have interfered with her in the case of any one else She was
still to be left entirely to herself in such matters and Mrs Kenton
would have kept even her thoughts off her if she could She would have
been very glad to give her mind wholly to the study of the great events
which had long interested her here in their scene but she felt that
until the conquest of Mr Breckon was secured beyond the hazard of
Ellens morbid defection at the supreme moment she could not give her
mind to the history of the Dutch republic

Dont bother me about Lottie Boyne she said I have enough to think
of without your nonsense If this Mr Trannel is an American that
is all that is necessary We are all Americans together and I dont
believe it will make remark Lotties sitting on the beach with him

I dont see how hes different from that Bittridge said Boyne He
doesnt care for anything and he plays the banjo just like him

Mrs Kenton was too troubled to laugh She said with finality Lottie
can take care of herself and then she asked Boyne do you know whom
Ellens letters were from

One was from Bessie Pearl

Yes she showed me that But you dont know who the other was from

No she didnt tell me You know how close Ellen is

Yes the mother sighed she is very odd

Then she added Dont you let her know that I asked you about her
letters

No said Boyne His audience was apparently at an end but he seemed
still to have something on his mind Momma he began afresh

Well she answered a little impatiently

Nothing Only I got to thinking Is a person able to control
theirtheir fancies

Fancies about what

Oh I dont know About falling in love Boyne blushed

Why do you want to know You musnt think about such things a boy like
you Its a great pity that you ever knew anything about that Bittridge
business Its made you too bold But it seems to have been meant to
drag us down and humiliate us in every way

Well I didnt try to know anything about it Boyne retorted

No thats true his mother did him the justice to recognize Well
what is it you want to know Boyne was too hurt to answer at once and
his mother had to coax him a little She did it sweetly and apologized
to him for saying what she had said After all he was the youngest
and her baby still Her words and caresses took effect at last and he
stammered out Is everybody so or is it only the Kentons that seem
to be always puttingwell their affectionswhere its perfectly
useless

His mother pushed him from her Boyne are you silly about that
ridiculous old Miss Rasmith

No Boyne shouted savagely Im NOT

Who is it then

I shant tell you Boyne said and tears of rage and shame came into
his eyes





XXI

In his exile from his kindred for it came practically to that Boyne
was able to add a fine gloom to the state which he commonly observed
with himself when he was not giving way to his morbid fancies or his
morbid fears and breaking down in helpless subjection to the nearest
member of his household Lottie was so taken up with her student that
she scarcely quarrelled with him any more and they had no longer those
moments of union in which they stood together against the world His
mother had cast him off as he felt very heartlessly though it was
really because she could not give his absurdities due thought in view of
the hopeful seriousness of Ellens affair and Boyne was aware that
his father at the best of times was ignorant of him when he was not
impatient of him These were not the best of times with Judge Kenton
and Boyne was not the first object of his impatience In the last
analysis he was living until he could get home and so largely in the
hope of this that his wife at times could scarcely keep him from taking
some step that would decide the matter between Ellen and Breckon at
once They were tacitly agreed that they were waiting for nothing else
and without making their agreement explicit she was able to quell him
by asking what he expected to do in case there was nothing between them
Was he going to take the child back to Tuskingum which was the same
as taking her back to Bittridge it hurt her to confront him with this
question and she tried other devices for staying and appeasing him
She begged him now seeing Boyne so forlorn and hanging about the hotel
alone or moping over those ridiculous books of his to go off with the
boy somewhere and see the interesting places within such easy reach
like Leyden and Delft if he cared nothing for the place where William
the Silent was shot he ought to see the place that the Pilgrims started
from She had counted upon doing those places herself with her husband
and it was in a sacrifice of her ideal that she now urged him to go
with Boyne But her preoccupation with Ellens affair forbade her
selfabandon to those high historical interests to which she urged his
devotion She might have gone with him and Boyne but then she must have
left the larger half of her divided mind with Ellen not to speak of
Lottie who refused to be a party to any such excursion Mrs Kenton
felt the disappointment and grieved at it but not without hope of
repairing it later and she did not cease from entreating the judge to
do what he could at once towards fulfilling the desires she postponed
Once she prevailed with him and really got him and Boyne off for a
day but they came back early with signs of having bored each other
intolerably and after that it was Boyne as much as his father who
relucted from joint expeditions Boyne did not so much object to going
alone and his father said it was best to let him though his mother
had her fears for her youngest He spent a good deal of his time on the
trams between Scheveningen and The Hague and he was understood to have
explored the capital pretty thoroughly In fact he did go about with a
valet de place whom he got at a cheap rate and with whom he conversed
upon the state of the country and its political affairs The valet said
that the only enemy that Holland could fear was Germany but an invasion
from that quarter could be easily repulsed by cutting the dikes and
drowning the invaders The sea he taught Boyne was the great defence
of Holland and it was a waste of money to keep such an army as the
Dutch had but neither the sea nor the sword could drive out the Germans
if once they insidiously married a Prussian prince to the Dutch Queen

There seemed to be no getting away from the Queen for Boyne The valet
not only talked about her as the pleasantest subject which he could
find but he insisted upon showing Boyne all her palaces He took
him into the Parliament house and showed him where she sat while the
queenmother read the address from the throne He introduced him at a
bazar where the shopgirl who spoke English better than Boyne or at
least without the central Ohio accent wanted to sell him a miniature of
the Queen on porcelain She said the Queen was such a nice girl and she
was herself such a nice girl that Boyne blushed a little in looking at
her He bought the miniature and then he did not know what to do with
it if any of the family if Lottie found out that he had it or that
Trannel he should have no peace any more He put it in his pocket
provisionally and when he came giddily out of the shop he felt himself
taken by the elbow and placed against the wall by the valet who said
the queens were coming They drove down slowly through the crowded
narrow street bowing right and left to the people flattened against the
shops and again Boyne saw her so near that he could have reached out
his hand and almost touched hers

The consciousness of this was so strong in him that he wondered whether
he had not tried to do so If he had he would have been arrestedhe
knew that and so he knew that he had not done it He knew that he
imagined doing so because it would be so awful to have done it and he
imagined being in love with her because it would be so frantic At
the same time he dramatized an event in which he died for her and
she became aware of his hopeless passion at the last moment while the
anarchist from whom he had saved her confessed that the bomb had been
meant for her Perhaps it was a pistol

He escaped from the valet as soon as he could and went back to
Scheveningen limp from this experience but the queens were before
him They had driven down to visit the studio of a famous Dutch painter
there and again the doom was on Boyne to press forward with the
other spectators and wait for the queens to appear and get into their
carriage The young Queens looks were stamped in Boynes consciousness
so that he saw her wherever he turned like the sun when one has gazed
at it He thought how that Trannel had said he ought to hand her into
her carriage and he shrank away for fear he should try to do so but he
could not leave the place till she had come out with the queenmother
and driven off Then he went slowly and breathlessly into the hotel
feeling the Queens miniature in his pocket It made his heart stand
still and then bound forward He wondered again what he should do with
it If he kept it Lottie would be sure to find it and he could not
bring himself to the sacrilege of destroying it He thought he would
walk out on the breakwater as far as he could and throw it into the sea
but when he got to the end of the mole he could not do so He decided
that he would give it to Ellen to keep for him and not let Lottie see
it or perhaps he might pretend he had bought it for her He could not
do that though for it would not be true and if he did he could not
ask her to keep it from Lottie

At dinner Mr Trannel told him he ought to have been there to see the
Queen that she had asked especially for him and wanted to know if they
had not sent up her card to him Boyne meditated an apt answer through
all the courses but he had not thought of one when they had come to
the corbeille de fruits and he was forced to go to bed without having
avenged himself

In taking rooms for her family at the hotel Lottie had arranged for her
emancipation from the thraldom of rooming with Ellen She said that had
gone on long enough if she was grown up at all she was grown up enough
to have a room of her own and her mother had yielded to reasoning which
began and ended with this position She would have interfered so far as
to put Lottie into the room next her but Lottie said that if Boyne was
the baby he ought to be next his mother Ellen might come next him but
she was going to have the room that was furthest from any implication
of the dependence in which she had languished and her mother submitted
again Boyne was not sorry there had always been hours of the night
when he felt the need of getting at his mother for reassurance as to
forebodings which his fancy conjured up to trouble him in the wakeful
dark It was understood that he might freely do this and though the
judge inwardly fretted he could not deny the boy the comfort of his
mothers encouraging love Boynes visits woke him but he slept the
better for indulging in the young nerves that tremor from impressions
against which the old nerves are proof But now in the strange fatality
which seemed to involve him Boyne could not go to his mother It was
too weirdly intimate even for her besides when he had already tried
to seek her counsel she had ignorantly repelled him

The night after his day in The Hague when he could bear it no longer
he put on his dressinggown and softly opened Ellens door awake
Ellen he whispered

Yes What is it Boyne her gentle voice asked

He came and sat down by her bed and stole his hand into hers which she
put out to him The watery moonlight dripped into the room at the edges
of the shades and the long wash of the sea made itself regularly heard
on the sands

Cant you sleep Ellen asked again Are you homesick

Not exactly that But it does seem rather strange for us to be off here
so far doesnt it

Yes I dont see how I can forgive myself for making you come said
Ellen but her voice did not sound as if she were very unhappy

You couldnt help it said Boyne and the words suggested a question
to him Do you believe that such things are ordered Ellen

Everything is ordered isnt it

I suppose so And if they are were not to blame for what happens

Not if we try to do right

Of course The Kentons always do that said Boyne with the faith in
his family that did not fail him in the darkest hour But what I mean
is that if anything comes on you that you cant foresee and you cant
get out of The next step was not clear and Boyne paused He asked

Do you think that we can control our feelings Ellen

About what

Well about persons that we like He added for safety Or dislike

Im afraid not said Ellen sadly We ought to like persons and
dislike them for some good reason but we dont

Yes thats what I mean said Borne with a long breath Sometimes it
seems like a kind of possession doesnt it

It seems more like that when we like them Ellen said

Yes thats what I mean If a person was to take a fancy to some one
that was above him that was richer or older he wouldnt be to blame
for it would he

Was that what you wanted to ask me about

Borne hesitated Yes he said He was in for it now

Ellen had not noticed Boynes absorption with Miss Rasmith on the ship
but she vaguely remembered hearing Lottie tease him about her and she
said now He wouldnt be to blame for it if he couldnt help it but if
the person was much older it would be a pity

Uh she isnt so very much older said Borne more cheerfully than he
had spoken before

Is it somebody that you have taken a fancy to Borne

I dont know Ellen Thats what makes it so kind of awful I cant
tell whether its a real fancy or I only think it is Sometimes I think
it is and sometimes I think that I think so because I am afraid to
believe it Do you under Ellen

It seems to me that I do But you oughtnt to let your fancy run away
with you Boyne What a queer boy

Its a kind of fascination I suppose But whether its a real fancy or
an unreal one I cant get away from it

Poor boy said his sister

Perhaps its those books Sometimes I think it is and I laugh at the
whole idea and then again its so strong that I cant get away from it
Ellen

Well Boyne

I could tell you who it is if you think that would do any goodif you
think it would help me to see it in the true light or you could help me
more by knowing who it is than you can now

I hope it isnt anybody that you cant respect Boyne

No indeed Its somebody you would never dream of

Well Ellen was waiting for him to speak but he could not get the
words out even to her

I guess Ill tell you some other time Maybe I can get over it myself

It would be the best way if you could

He rose and left her bedside and then he came back Ellen Ive got
something that I wish you would keep for me

What is it Of course I will

Well itssomething I dont want you to let Lottie know Ive got She
tells that Mr Trannel everything and then he wants to make fun Do you
think hes so very witty

I cant help laughing at some things he says

I suppose he is Boyne ruefully admitted But that doesnt make you
like him any better Well if you wont tell Lottie Ill give it to you
now

I wont tell anything that you dont want me to Boyne

Its nothing Its justa picture of the Queen on porcelain that I got
in The Hague The guide took me into the store and I thought I ought to
get something

Oh thats very nice Boyne I do like the Queen so much Shes so
sweet

Yes isnt she said Boyne glad of Ellens approval So far at
least he was not wrong Here it is now

He put the miniature in Ellens hand She lifted herself on her elbow
Light the candle and let me see it

No no he entreated It might wake Lottie andandGoodnight
Ellen

Can you go to sleep now Boyne

Oh yes Im all right Goodnight

Goodnight then

Borne stooped over and kissed her and went to the door He came back
and asked You dont think it was silly or anything for me to get
it

No indeed Its just what you will like to have when you get home
Weve all seen her so often Ill put it in my trunk and nobody shall
know about it till were safely back in Tuskingum

Boyne sighed deeply Yes thats what I meant Goodnight

Goodnight Boyne

I hope I havent waked you up too much

Oh no I can get to sleep easily again

Well goodnight Boyne sighed again but not so deeply and this time
he went out




XXII

Mrs Kenton woke with the clear vision which is sometimes vouchsafed to
people whose eyes are holden at other hours of the day She had heard
Boyne opening and shutting Ellens door and her heart smote her that
he should have gone to his sister with whatever trouble he was in rather
than come to his mother It was natural that she should put the blame
on her husband and Now Mr Kenton she began with an austerity of
voice which he recognized before he was well awake if you wont take
Boyne off somewhere today I will I think we had better all go We
have been here a whole fortnight and we have got thoroughly rested and
there is no excuse for our wasting our time any longer If we are going
to see Holland we had better begin doing it

The judge gave a general assent and said that if she wanted to go
to Flushing he supposed he could find some gardenseeds there in the
flower and vegetable nurseries which would be adapted to the climate of
Tuskingum and they could all put in the day pleasantly looking round
the place Whether it was the suggestion of Tuskingum in relation to
Flushing that decided her against the place or whether she had really
meant to go to Leyden she now expressed the wish as vividly as if it
were novel to explore the scene of the Pilgrims sojourn before they
sailed for Plymouth and she reproached him for not caring about the
place when they both used to take such an interest in it at home

Well said the judge if I were at home I should take an interest in
it here

This provoked her to a silence which he thought it best to break in
tacit compliance with her wish and he asked Do you propose taking the
whole family and the appurtenances We shall be rather a large party

Ellen would wish to go and I suppose Mr Breckon We couldnt very
well go without them

And how about Lottie and that young Trannel

We cant leave him out very well I wish we could I dont like him

Theres nothing easier than not asking him if you dont want him

Yes there is when youve got a girl like Lottie to deal with Quite
likely she would ask him herself We must take him because we cant
leave her

Yes I reckon the judge acquiesced

Im glad Mrs Kenton said after a moment that it isnt Ellen hes
after it almost reconciles me to his being with Lottie so much I only
wonder he doesnt take to Ellen hes so much like that

She did not say out what was in her mind but her husband knew Yes
Ive noticed it This young Breckon was quite enough so for my taste I
dont know what it is that just saves him from it

Hes good You could tell that from the beginning

They went off upon the situation that superficially or subliminally
was always interesting them beyond anything in the world and they did
not openly recur to Mrs Kentons plan for the day till they met their
children at breakfast It was a meal at which Breckon and Trammel were
both apt to join them where they took it at two of the tables on the
broad seaward piazza of the hotel when the weather was fine Both
the young men now applauded her plan in their different sorts It was
easily arranged that they should go by train and not by tram from The
Hague The train was chosen and Mrs Kenton when she went to her
room to begin the preparations for a days pleasure which constitute so
distinctly a part of its pain imagined that everything was settled She
had scarcely closed the door behind her when Lottie opened it and shut
it again behind her

Mother she said in the new style of address to which she was
habituating Mrs Kenton after having so long called her momma I am
not going with you

Indeed you are then her mother retorted Do you think I would leave
you here all day with that fellow A nice talk we should make

You are perfectly welcome to that fellow mother and as hes accepted
he will have to go with you and there wont be any talk But as I
remarked before I am not going

Why arent you going I should like to know

Because I dont like the company

What do you mean Have you got anything against Mr Breckon

Hes insipid but as long as Ellen dont mind it I dont care I object
to Mr Trannel

Why

I dont see why I should have to tell you If I said I liked him you
might want to know but it seems to me that my not liking him ismy
not liking him is my own affair There was a kind of logic in this that
silenced Mrs Kenton for the moment In view of her advantage Lottie
relented so far as to add Ive found out something about him

Mrs Kenton was imperative in her alarm What is it she demanded

Lottie answered obliquely Well I didnt leave The Hague to get rid
of them and then take up with one of them at Scheveningen

One of what

COOKS TOURISTS if you must know mother Mr Trannel as you call
him is a Cooks tourist and thats the end of it I have got no use
for him from this out

Mrs Kenton was daunted and not for the first time by her daughters
superior knowledge of life She could put Boyne down sometimes though
not always when he attempted to impose a novel code of manners or
morals upon her but she could not cope with Lottie In the present case
she could only ask Well

Well theyre the cheapest of the cheap He actually showed me his
coupons and tried to put me down with the idea that everybody used
them But I guess he found it wouldnt work He said if you were not
personally conducted it was all right

Now Lottie you have got to tell me just what you mean said Mrs
Kenton and from having stood during this parley she sat down to hear
Lottie out at her leisure But if there was anything more difficult than
for Lottie to be explicit it was to make her be so and in the end
Mrs Kenton was scarcely wiser than she was at the beginning to her
daughters reasons It appeared that if you wanted to be cheap you could
travel with those coupons and Lottie did not wish to be cheap or have
anything to do with those who were The Kentons had always held up their
heads and if Ellen had chosen to disgrace them with Bittridge Dick had
made it all right and she at least was not going to do anything that
she would be ashamed of She was going to stay at home and have her
meals in her room till they got back

Her mother paid no heed to her repeated declaration Lottie she
asked with the heartquake that the thought of Richards act always
gave her with reference to Ellen have you ever let out the least hint
of that

Of course I havent Lottie scornfully retorted I hope I know what a
crank Ellen is

They were not just the terms in which Mrs Kenton would have chosen to
be reassured but she was glad to be assured in any terms She said
vaguely I believe in my heart that I will stay at home too All this
has given me a bad headache

I was going to have a headache myself said Lottie with injury But
I suppose I can get on along without I can just simply say Im not
going If he proposes to stay too I can soon settle that

The great difficulty will be to get your father to go

You can make Ellen make him Lottie suggested

That is true said Mrs Kenton with such increasing absence that her
daughter required of her

Are you staying on my account

I think you had better not be left alone the whole day But I am not
staying on your account I dont believe we had so many of us better go
It might look a little pointed

Lottie laughed harshly I guess Mr Breckon wouldnt see the point
hes so perfectly gone

Do you really believe it Lottie Mrs Kenton entreated with a sudden
tenderness for her younger daughter such as she did not always feel

I should think anybody would believe itanybody but Ellen

Yes Mrs Kenton dreamily assented

Lottie made her way to the door Well if you do stay mother Im not
going to have you hanging round me all day I can chaperon myself

Lottie her mother tried to stay her I wish you would go I dont
believe that Mr Trannel will be much of an addition He will be on your
poor fathers hands all day or else Ellens and if you went you could
help off

Thank you mother Ive had quite all I want of Mr Trannel You can
tell him he neednt go if you want to

Lottie at least did not leave her mother to make her excuses to the
party when they met for starting Mrs Kenton had deferred her own
till she thought it was too late for her husband to retreat and then
bunglingly made them with so much iteration that it seemed to her it
would have been far less pointed as concerned Mr Breckon if she
had gone Lottie sunnily announced that she was going to stay with
her mother and did not even try to account for her defection to Mr
Trannel

Whats the matter with my staying too he asked It seems to me
there are four wheels to this coach now

He had addressed his misgiving more to Lottie than the rest but with
the same sunny indifference to the consequence for others that she had
put on in stating her decision she now discharged herself from further
responsibility by turning on her heel and leaving it with the party
generally In the circumstances Mr Trannel had no choice but to go and
he was supported possibly by the hope of taking it out of Lottie some
other time

It was more difficult for Mrs Kenton to get rid of the judge but an
inscrutable frown goes far in such exigencies It seems to explain and
it certainly warns and the husband on whom it is bent never knows even
after the longest experience whether he had better inquire further
Usually he decides that he had better not and Judge Kenton went off
towards the tram with Boyne in the cloud of mystery which involved them
both as to Mrs Kentons meaning




XXIII


Trannel attached himself as well as he could to Breckon and Ellen
and Breckon had an opportunity not fully offered him before to note
a likeness between himself and a fellowman whom he was aware of not
liking though he tried to love him as he felt it right to love all
men He thought he had not been quite sympathetic enough with Mrs
Kenton in her having to stay behind and he tried to make it up to Mr
Trannel in his having to come He invented civilities to show him and
ceded his place next Ellen as if Trannel had a right to it Trannel
ignored him in keeping it unless it was recognizing Breckon to say
Oh I hope Im not in your way old fellow and then making jokes to
Ellen Breckon could not say the jokes were bad though the taste
of them seemed to him so The man had a fleeting wit which scorched
whatever he turned it upon and yet it was wit Why dont you try him
in American he asked at the failure of Breckon and the tram conductor
to understand each other in Dutch He tried the conductor himself in
American and he was so deplorably funny that it was hard for Breckon to
help being particeps criminus at least in a laugh

He asked himself if that were really the kind of man he was and he grew
silent and melancholy in the fear that it was a good deal the sort of
man To this morbid fancy Trannel seemed himself in a sort of excess or
what he would be if he were logically ultimated He remembered all the
triviality of his behavior with Ellen at first and rather sickened at
the thought of some of his early pleasantries She was talking gayly
now with Trannel and Breckon wondered whether she was falling under the
charm that he felt in him in spite of himself

If she was her father was not The judge sat on the other side of the
car and unmistakably glowered at the fellows attempts to make himself
amusing to Ellen Trannel himself was not insensible to the judges
mood Now and then he said something to intensify it He patronized the
judge and he made fun of the tourist character in which Boyne had got
himself up with a fieldglass slung by a strap under one arm and a
red Baedeker in his hand He sputtered with malign laughter at a rather
gorgeous necktie which Boyne had put on for the day and said it was not
a very good match for the Baedeker

Boyne retorted rudely and that amused Trannel still more He became
personal to Breckon and noted the unclerical cut of his clothes He
said he ought to have put on his uniform for an expedition like that
in case they got into any sort of trouble To Ellen alone he was
inoffensive unless he overdid his polite attentions to her in carrying
her parasol for her and helping her out of the tram when they arrived
shouldering every one else away and making haste to separate her from
the others and then to walk on with her a little in advance

Suddenly he dropped her and fell back to Boyne and his father while
Breckon hastened forward to her side Trannel put his arm across Boynes
shoulders and asked him if he were mad and then laughed at him Youre
all right Boyne but you oughtnt to be so approachable You ought to
put on more dignity and repel familiarity

Boyne could only twitch away in silence that he made as haughty as he
could but not so haughty that Trannel did not find it laughable and he
laughed in a teasing way that made Breckon more and more serious He
was aware of becoming even solemn with the question of his likeness to
Trannel He was of Trannels quality and their difference was a matter
of quantity and there was not enough difference In his sense of their
likeness Breckon vowed himself to a gravity of behavior evermore
which he should not probably be able to observe but the sample he now
displayed did not escape the keen vigilance of Trannel

With the exception of Miss Kenton he addressed himself to the party
youre all so easy and careless that if you dont look out youll lose
me Miss Kenton I wish you would keep an eye on me I dont want to get
lost

Ellen laughedshe could not help itand her laughing made it less
possible than before for Breckon to unbend and meet Trannel on his own
ground to give him joke for joke to exchange banter with him He might
never have been willing to do that but now he shrank from it in his
realization of their likeness with an abhorrence that rendered him
rigid

The judge was walking ahead with Boyne and his back expressed such
severe disapproval that between her fear that Trannel would say
something to bring her fathers condemnation on him and her sense of
their inhospitable attitude towards one who was their guest in a sort
she said with her gentle gayety Then you must keep near me Mr
Trannel Ill see that nothing happens

Thats very sweet of you said Trannel soberly Whether he had now
vented his malicious humor and was ready to make himself agreeable or
was somewhat quelled by the unfriendly ambient he had created or was
wrought upon by her friendliness he became everything that could be
wished in a companion for a days pleasure He took the lead at the
station and got them a compartment in the car to themselves for the
little run to Leyden and on the way he talked very well He politely
borrowed Boynes Baedeker and decided for the party what they had
best see and showed an acceptable intelligence as well as a large
experience in the claims of Leyden upon the visitors interest He had
been there often before it seemed and in the event it appeared that he
had chosen the days sightseeing wisely

He no longer addressed himself respectfully to Ellen alone but he
reestablished himself in Boynes confidence with especial pains and he
conciliated Breckon by a recognition of his priority with Ellen with a
delicacy refined enough for even the susceptibility of a lover alarmed
for his rights If he could not overcome the reluctance of the judge he
brought him to the civil response which any one who tried for Kentons
liking achieved even if he did not merit it and there remained no more
reserve in Kentons manner than there had been with the young man from
the first He had never been a persona grata to the judge and if he did
not become so now he at least ceased to be actively displeasing

That was the year before the young Queen came to her own and in the
last days of her minority she was visiting all the cities of her future
dominion with the queenmother When Kentons party left the station
they found Leyden as gay for her reception as flags and banners could
make the gray old town and Trannel relapsed for a moment so far as to
suggest that the decorations were in honor of Boynes presence but he
did not abuse the laugh that this made to Boynes further shame

There was no carriage at the station which would hold the party of five
and they had to take two vehicles Trannel said it was lucky they wanted
two since there were no more and he put himself in authority to assort
the party The judge he decided must go with Ellen and Breckon and he
hoped Boyne would let him go in his carriage if he would sit on the box
with the driver The judge afterwards owned that he had weakly indulged
his dislike of the fellow in letting him take Boyne and not insisting
on going himself with Tramiel but this was when it was long too
late Ellen had her misgivings but except for that gibe about the
decorations Trannel had been behaving so well that she hoped she might
trust Boyne with him She made a kind of appeal for her brother bidding
him and Trannel take good care of each other and Trannel promised so
earnestly to look after Boyne that she ought to have been alarmed for
him He took the lead rising at times to wave a reassuring hand to her
over the back of his carriage and in fact nothing evil could very
well happen from him with the others following so close upon him They
met from time to time in the churches they visited and when they lost
sight of one another through a difference of opinion in the drivers as
to the best route they came together at the place Trannel had appointed
for their next reunion

He showed himself a guide so admirably qualified that he found a way
for them to objects of interest that had at first denied themselves in
anticipation of the visit from the queens when they all sat down at
lunch in the restaurant which he found for them he could justifiably
boast that he would get them into the Town Hall which they had been
told was barred for the day against anything but sovereign curiosity
He was now on the best term with Boyne who seemed to have lost all
diffidence of him and treated him with an easy familiarity that showed
itself in his slapping him on the shoulder and making dints in his hat
Trannel seemed to enjoy these caresses and when they parted again for
the afternoons sightseeing Ellen had no longer a qualm in letting
Boyne drive off with him

He had in fact known how to make himself very acceptable to Boyne He
knew all the originals of his heroical romances and was able to give
the real names and the geographical position of those princesses who
had been in love with American adventurers Under promise of secrecy he
disclosed the real names of the adventurers themselves now obscured in
the titles given them to render them worthy their union with sovereigns
He resumed his fascinating confidences when they drove off after
luncheon and he resumed them after each separation from the rest of the
party Boyne listened with a flushed face and starting eyes and when at
last Trannel offered upon a pledge of the most sacred nature from him
never to reveal a word of what he said he began to relate an adventure
of which he was himself the hero It was a bold travesty of one of the
latest romances that Boyne had read involving the experience of an
American very little older than Boyne himself to whom a wilful young
crownprincess in a little state which Trannel would not name even to
Boyne had made advances such as he could not refuse to meet without
cruelty He was himself deeply in love with her but he felt bound in
honor not to encourage her infatuation as long as he could help for he
had been received by her whole family with such kindness and confidence
that he had to consider them

Oh pshaw Boyne broke in upon him doubting and yet wishing not to
doubt thats the same as the story of Hector Folleyne

Yes said Trannel quietly I thought you would recognize it

Well but Boyne went on Hector married the princess

In the book yes The fellow I gave the story to said it would never
do not to have him marry her and it would help to disguise the fact
Thats what he said after he had given the whole thing away

And do you mean to say it was you Oh you cant stuff me How did you
get out of marrying her I should like to know when the chancellor came
to you and said that the whole family wanted you to for fear it would
kill her if

Well there was a scene I cant deny that We had a regular family
conclavefather mother Aunt Hitty and all the folksand we kept it
up pretty much all night The princess wasnt there of course and I
could convince them that I was right If she had been I dont believe
I could have held out But they had to listen to reason and I got away
between two days

But why didnt you marry her

Well for one thing as I told you I thought I ought to consider
her family Then there was a good fellow the crownprince of
SaxeWolfenhutten who was dead in love with her and was engaged to her
before I turned up I had been at school with him and I felt awfully
sorry for him and I thought I ought to sacrifice myself a little to
him But I suppose the thing that influenced me most was finding out
that if I married the princess I should have to give up my American
citizenship and become her subject

Well Boyne panted

Well would you have done it

Couldnt you have got along without doing that

That was the only thing I couldnt get around somehow So I left

And the princess did shedie

It takes a good deal more than that to kill a fifteenyearold
princess said Trannel and he gave a harsh laugh She married
SaxeWolfenhutten Boyne was silent Now I dont want you to speak
of this till after I leave Scheveningenespecially to Miss Lottie You
know how girls are and I think Miss Lottie is waiting to get a bind
on me anyway If she heard how I was cut out of my chance with that
princess shed never let me believe I gave her up of my own free will

NO no I wont tell her

Boyne remained in a silent rapture and he did not notice they were no
longer following the rest of their party in the other carriage This had
turned down a corner at which Mr Breckon sitting on the front seat
had risen and beckoned their driver to follow but their driver who
appeared afterwards to have not too much a head of his own or no head
at all had continued straight on in the rear of a tramcar which was
slowly finding its way through the momently thickening crowd Boyne was
first aware that it was a humorous crowd when at a turn of the street
their equipage was greeted with ironical cheers by a group of gay young
Dutchmen on the sidewalk Then he saw that the sidewalks were packed
with people who spread into the street almost to the tram and that the
house fronts were dotted with smiling Dutch faces the faces of pretty
Dutch girls who seemed to share the amusement of the young fellows
below

Trannel lay back in the carriage This is something like he said
Boyne theyre on to the distinguished young Ohioanthe only Ohioan
out of office in Europe

Yes said Boyne trying to enjoy it I wonder what they are holloing
at

Trannel laughed Theyre holloing at your Baedeker my dear boy They
never saw one before and Boyne was aware that he was holding his
redbacked guide conspicuously in view on his lap They know youre a
foreigner by it

Dont you think we ought to turn down somewhere I dont see poppa
anywhere He rose and looked anxiously back over the top of their
carriage The crowd closing in behind it hailed his troubled face with
cries that were taken up by the throng on the sidewalks Boyne turned
about to find that the tramcar which they had been following had
disappeared round a corner but their driver was still keeping on At
a wilder burst of applause Trannel took off his hat and bowed to the
crowd right and left

Bow bow he said to Boyne Theyll be calling for a speech the next
thing Bow I tell you

Tell him to turn round cried the boy

I cant speak Dutch said Trannel and Boyne leaned forward and poked
the driver in the back

Go back he commanded

The driver shook his head and pointed forward with his whip Hes all
right said Trannel He cant turn now Weve got to take the next
corner The street in front was empty and the people were crowding
back on the sidewalks Loud vague noises made themselves heard round
the corner to which the driver had pointed By Jove Trannel said I
believe theyre coming round that way

Who are coming Boyne palpitated

The queens

The queens Boyne gasped it seemed to him that he shrieked the words

Yes And theres a tobacconists now said Trannel as if that were
what he had been looking for all along I want some cigarettes

He leaped lightly from the carriage and pushed his way out of sight on
the sidewalk Boyne remained alone in the vehicle staring wildly round
the driver kept slowly and stupidly on Boyne did not know how much
farther He could not speak he felt as if he could not stir But the
moment came when he could not be still He gave a galvanic jump to the
ground and the friendly crowd on the sidewalk welcomed him to its ranks
and closed about him The driver had taken the lefthand corner just
before a plain carriage with the Queen and the queenmother came in
sight round the right The young Queen was bowing to the people gently
and with a sort of mechanical regularity Now and then a brighter
smile than that she conventionally wore lighted up her face The simple
progress was absolutely without state except for the aidedecamp on
horseback who rode beside the carriage a little to the front

Boyne stood motionless on the curb where a friendly tall Dutchman had
placed him in front that he might see the Queen

Hello said the voice of Trannel and elbowing his way to Boynes
side he laughed and coughed through the smoke of his cigarette I was
afraid you had lost me Wheres your carriage

Boyne did not notice his mockeries He was entranced in that beatific
vision his boyheart went out in worship to the pretty young creature
with a reverence that could not be uttered The tears came into his
eyes

There there Shes bowing to you Boyne shes smiling right at you
By Jove Shes beckoning to you

You be still Boyne retorted finding his tongue She isnt doing any
such a thing

She is I swear she is Shes doing it again Shes stopping the
carriage Oh go out and see what she wants Dont you know that a
queens wish is a command Youve got to go

Boyne never could tell just how it happened The carriage did seem to be
stopping and the Queen seemed to be looking at him He thought he
must and he started into the street towards her and the carriage came
abreast of him He had almost reached the carriage when the aide turned
and spurred his horse before him Four strong hands that were like iron
clamps were laid one on each of Boynes elbows and shoulders and he was
haled away as if by superhuman force Mr Trannel he called out in
his agony but the wretch had disappeared and Boyne was left with his
captors to whom he could have said nothing if he could have thought of
anything to say

The detectives pulled him through the crowd and hurried him swiftly down
the side street A little curiosity straggled after him in the shape
of small Dutch boys too short to look over the shoulders of men at the
queens and too weak to make their way through them to the front but
for them Boyne seemed alone in the world with the relentless officers
who were dragging him forward and hurting him so with the grip of their
iron hands He lifted up his face to entreat them not to hold him so
tight and suddenly it was as if he beheld an angel standing in his
path It was Breckon who was there staring at him aghast

Why Boyne he cried

Oh Mr Breckon Boyne wailed back Is it you Oh do tell them I
didnt mean to do anything I thought she beckoned to me

Who Who beckoned to you

The Queen Boyne sobbed while the detectives pulled him relentlessly
on

Breckon addressed them suavely in their owe tongue which had never come
in more deferential politeness from human lips He ventured the belief
that there was a mistake he assured them that he knew their prisoner
and that he was the son of a most respectable American family whom they
could find at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen He added some irrelevancies
and got for all answer that they had made Boynes arrest for sufficient
reasons and were taking him to prison If his friends wished to
intervene in his behalf they could do so before the magistrate but for
the present they must admonish Mr Breckon not to put himself in the way
of the law

Dont go Mr Breckon Boyne implored him as his captors made him
quicken his pace after slowing a little for their colloquy with Breckon
Oh where is poppa He could get me away Oh where is poppa

Dont Dont call out Boyne Breckon entreated Your father is right
here at the end of the street Hes in the carriage there with Miss
Kenton I was coming to look for you Dont cry out so

No no I wont Mr Breckon Ill be perfectly quiet now Only do get
poppa quick He can tell them in a minute that its all right

He made a prodigious effort to control himself while Breckon ran
a little ahead with some wild notion of preparing Ellen As he
disappeared at the corner Boyne choked a sob into a muffed bellow and
was able to meet the astonished eyes of his father and sister in this
degree of triumph

They had not in the least understood Breckons explanation and in
fact it had not been very lucid At sight of her brother strenuously
upheld between the detectives and dragged along the sidewalk Ellen
sprang from the carriage and ran towards him Why whats the matter
with Boyne she demanded Are you hurt Boyne dear Are they taking
him to the hospital

Before he could answer and quite before the judge could reach the
tragical group she had flung her arms round Boynes neck and was
kissing his teardrabbled face while he lamented back Theyre taking
me to prison

Taking you to prison I should like to know what for What are you
taking my brother to prison for she challenged the detectives who
paused bewildered while all the little Dutch boys round admired this
obstruction of the law and several Dutch housewives too old to go
out to see the queens looked down from their windows It was wholly
illegal but the detectives were human They could snub such a friend of
their prisoner as Breckon but they could not meet the dovelike ferocity
of Ellen with unkindness They explained as well as they might and at a
suggestion which Kenton made through Breckon they admitted that it was
not beside their duty to take Boyne directly to a magistrate who could
pass upon his case and even release him upon proper evidence of his
harmlessness and sufficient security for any demand that justice might
make for his future appearance

Then said the judge quietly tell them that we will go with them
It will be all right Boyne Ellen you and I will get back into the
carriage and

No Boyne roared Dont leave me Nelly

Indeed I wont leave you Boyne Mr Breckon you get into the
carriage with poppa and I

I think I had better go with you Miss Kenton said Breckon and in a
tender superfluity they both accompanied Boyne on foot while the judge
remounted to his place in the carriage and kept abreast of them on their
way to the magistrates




XXIV

The magistrate conceived of Boynes case with a readiness that gave the
judge a high opinion of his personal and national intelligence He even
smiled a little in accepting the explanation which Breckon was able to
make him from Boyne but he thought his duty to give the boy a fatherly
warning for the future He remarked to Breckon that it was well for
Boyne that the affair had not happened in Germany where it would have
been found a much more serious matter though indeed he added it
had to be seriously regarded anywhere in these times when the lives
of sovereigns were so much at the mercy of all sorts of madmen and
miscreants He relaxed a little from his severity in his admonition to
say directly to Boyne that queens even when they wished to speak with
people did not beckon them in the public streets When this speech
translated to Boyne by Breckon whom the magistrate complimented on the
perfection of his Dutch Boyne hung his head sheepishly and could not
be restored to his characteristic dignity again in the magistrates
presence The judge gratefully shook hands with the friendly justice
and made him a little speech of thanks which Breckon interpreted and
then the justice shook hand with the judge and gracefully accepted the
introduction which he offered him to Ellen They parted with reciprocal
praises and obeisances which included even the detectives The judge
had some question which he submitted to Breckon whether he ought not
to offer them something but Breckon thought not

Breckon found it hard to abdicate the sort of authority in which his
knowledge of Dutch had placed him and when he protested that he had
done nothing but act as interpreter Ellen said Yes but we couldnt
have done anything without you and this was the view that Mrs Kenton
took of the matter in the family conclave which took place later in the
evening Breckon was not allowed to withdraw from it in spite of many
modest efforts before she had bashfully expressed her sense of his
service to him and made Boyne share her thanksgiving She had her arm
about the boys shoulder in giving Breckon her hand and when Breckon
had got away she pulled Boyne to her in a more peremptory embrace

Now Boyne she said I am not going to have any more nonsense I
want to know why you did it

The judge and Ellen had already conjectured clearly enough and Boyne
did not fear them But he looked at his younger sister as he sulkily
answered I am not going to tell you before Lottie

Come in here then said his mother and she led him into the next
room and closed the door She quickly returned without him Yes she
began its just as I supposed it was that worthless fellow who
put him up to it Of course it began with those fool books hes been
reading and the notions that Miss Rasmith put into his head But he
never would have done anything if it hadnt been for Mr Trannel

Lottie had listened in silent scorn to the whole proceedings up to this
point and had refused a part in the general recognition of Breckon as
a special providence Now she flashed out with a terrible volubility
What did I tell you What else could you expect of a Cooks tourist
And mommother wanted to make me go with you after I told her what
he was Well if I had have gone Ill bet I could have kept him from
playing his tricks Ill bet he wouldnt have taken any liberties
with me along Ill bet if he had it wouldnt have been Boyne that
got arrested Ill bet he wouldnt have got off so easily with the
magistrate either But I suppose youll all let him come bowing and
smiling round in the morning like butter wouldnt melt in your mouths
That seems to be the Kenton way Anybody can pull our noses or get us
arrested that wants to and we never squeak She went on a long time
to this purpose Mrs Kenton listening with an air almost of conviction
and Ellen patiently bearing it as a right that Lottie had in a matter
where she had been otherwise ignored

The judge broke out not upon Lottie but upon his wife Good heavens
Sarah cant you make the child hush

Lottie answered for her mother with a crash of nerves and a gush of
furious tears Oh Ive got to hush I suppose Its always the way
when Im trying to keep up the dignity of the family I suppose it will
be cabled to America and by tomorrow it will be all over Tuskingum how
Boyne was made a fool of and got arrested But I bet theres one person
in Tuskingum that wont have any remarks to make and thats Bittridge
Not as long as Dicks there he wont

Lottie cried her mother and her father started towards her while
Ellen still sat patiently quiet

Oh well Lottie submitted But if Dick was here I know this Trannel
wouldnt get off so smoothly Dick would give him a worse cowhiding than
he did Bittridge

Half the last word was lost in the bang of the door which Lottie slammed
behind her leaving her father and mother to a silence which Ellen did
not offer to break The judge had no heart to speak in his dismay and
it was Mrs Kenton who took the word

Ellen she began with compassionate gentleness we tried to keep it
from you We knew how you would feel But now we have got to tell you
Dick did cowhide him when he got back to Tuskingum Lottie wrote out to
Dick about it how Mr Bittridge had behaved in New York Your father
and I didnt approve of it and Dick didnt afterwards but yes he did
do it

I knew it momma said Ellen sadly

You knew it How

That other letter I got when we first cameit was from his mother

Did she tell

Yes It was terrible she seemed to feel so And I was sorry for her I
thought I ought to answer it and I did I told her I was sorry too
I tried not to blame Richard I dont believe I did And I tried not to
blame him She was feeling badly enough without that

Her father and mother looked at each other they did not speak and she
asked Do you think I oughtnt to have written

Her father answered a little tremulously You did right Ellen And I
am sure that you did it in just the right way

I tried to I thought I wouldnt worry you about it

She rose and now her mother thought she was going to say that it put
an end to everything that she must go back and offer herself as a
sacrifice to the injured Bittridges Her mind had reverted to that
moment on the steamer when Ellen told her that nothing had reconciled
her to what had happened with Bittridge but the fact that all the wrong
done had been done to themselves that this freed her In her despair
she could not forbear asking What did you write to her Ellen

Nothing I just said that I was very sorry and that I knew how she
felt I dont remember exactly

She went up and kissed her mother She seemed rather fatigued than
distressed and her father asked her Are you going to bed my dear

Yes Im pretty tired and I should think you would be too poppa
Ill speak to poor Boyne Dont mind Lottie I suppose she couldnt
help saying it She kissed her father and slipped quietly into Boynes
room from which they could hear her passing on to her own before they
ventured to say anything to each other in the hopeful bewilderment to
which she had left them

Well said the judge

Well Mrs Kenton returned in a note of exasperation as if she were
not going to let herself be forced to the initiative

I thought you thought

I did think that Now I dont know what to think We have got to wait

Im willing to wait for Ellen

She seems said Mrs Kenton to have more sense than both the other
children put together and I was afraid

She might easily have more sense than Boyne or Lottie either

Well I dont know Mrs Kenton began But she did not go on to resent
the disparagement which she had invited What I was afraid of was her
goodness It was her goodness that got her into the trouble to begin
with If she hadnt been so good that fellow could never have fooled
her as he did She was too innocent

The judge could not forbear the humorous view Perhaps shes getting
wickeder or not so innocent At any rate she doesnt seem to have been
take in by Trannel

He didnt pay any attention to her He was all taken up with Lottie

Well that was lucky Sarah said the judge do you think he is like
Bittridge

Hes made me think of him all the time

Its curious the judge mused I have always noticed how our faults
repeat themselves but I didnt suppose our fates would always take the
same shape or something like it Mrs Kenton stared at him When this
other one first made up to us on the boat my heart went down I thought
of Bittridge so

Mr Breckon

Yes the same lightness the same sort of triflingDidnt you notice
it

Noyes I noticed it But I wasnt afraid for an instant I saw that
he was good

Oh

What Im afraid of now is that Ellen doesnt care anything about him

He isnt wicked enough

I dont say that But it would be too much happiness to expect in one
short life

The judge could not deny the reasonableness of her position He could
only oppose it Well I dont think weve had any more than our share
of happiness lately

No one except Boyne could have made Trannels behavior a cause of
quarrel but the other Kentons made it a cause of coldness which was
quite as effective In Lottie this took the form of something so active
so positive that it was something more than a mere absence of warmth
Before she came clown to breakfast the next morning she studied a stare
in her mirror and practised it upon Trannel so successfully when he
came up to speak to her that it must have made him doubt whether he had
ever had her acquaintance In his doubt he ventured to address her
and then Lottie turned her back upon him in a manner that was perfectly
convincing He attempted a smiling ease with Mrs Kenton and the judge
but they shared neither his smile nor his ease and his jocose questions
about the end of yesterdays adventures which he had not been privy to
did not seem to appeal to the American sense of humor in them Ellen was
not with them nor Boyne but Trannel was not asked to take either of
the vacant places at the table even when Breckon took one of them
after a decent exchange of civilities with him He could only saunter
away and leave Mrs Kenton to a little pang

Tchk she made Im sorry for him

So am I said the judge But he will get over itonly too soon Im
afraid I dont believe hes very sorry for himself

They had not advised with Breckon and he did not feel authorized to
make any comment He seemed preoccupied to Mrs Kentons eye when she
turned it upon him from Trannels discomfited back lessening in the
perspective and he answered vaguely to her overture about his nights
rest Lottie never made any conversation with Breckon and she now left
him to himself with some remnants of the disapproval which she found on
her hands after crushing Trannel It could not be said that Breckon was
aware of her disapproval and the judge had no apparent consciousness
of it He and Breckon tried to make something of each other but failed
and it all seemed a very defeating sequel to Mrs Kenton after the
triumphal glow of the evening before When Lottie rose she went with
her alleging her wish to see if Boyne had eaten his breakfast She
confessed to Breckons kind inquiry that Boyne did not seem very well
and that she had made him take his breakfast in his room and she did
not think it necessary to own even to so friendly a witness as Mr
Breckon that Boyne was ashamed to come down and dreaded meeting
Trannel so much that she was giving him time to recover his selfrespect
and courage




XV

As soon as she and Lottie were gone Breckon began rather more
formidably than he liked but helplessly so Judge Kenton I should be
glad of a few moments with you onon an importanton a matter that is
important to me

Well said the judge cautiously Whatever was coming he wished to
guard himself from the mistake that he had once so nearly fallen into
and that still made him catch his breath to think of How can I be of
use to you

I dont know that you can be of any useI dont know that I ought
to speak to you But I thought you might perhaps save me fromsave my
taking a false step

He looked at Kenton as if he would understand and Kenton supposed that
he did He said My daughter once mentioned your wish to talk with me

Your daughter Breckon stared at him in stupefaction

Yes Ellen She said you wished to consult me about going back to your
charge in New York when we were on the ship together But I dont know
that Im very competent to give advice in such

Oh Breckon exclaimed in a tone of immense relief which did not
continue itself in what he went on to say That Ive quite made up my
mind to go back He stopped and then he burst out I want to speak
with you about her The judge sat steady still resolute not to give
himself away and the young man scarcely recovered from what had been
a desperate plunge in adding I know that its usual to speak with
herwith the lady herself first butI dont know The circumstances
are peculiar You only know about me what youve seen of me and I would
rather make my mistakes in the order that seems right to me although it
isnt just the American way

He smiled rather piteously and the judge said rather encouragingly I
dont quite know whether I follow you

Breckon blushed and sought help in what remained of his coffee The
way isnt easy for me But its this I ask your leave to ask Miss Ellen
to marry me The worst was over now and looked as if it were a relief
She is the most beautiful person in the world to me and the best but
as you know so little of me I thought it right to get your leaveto
tell youtotoThat is all He fell back in his chair and looked a
at Kenton

It is unusual the judge began

Yes Yes I know that And for that reason I speak first to you Ill
be ruled by you implicitly

I dont mean that Kenton said I would have expected that you would
speak to her first But I get your point of view and I must say I think
youre right I think you are behavinghonorably I wish that every one
was like you But I cant say anything now I must talk with her mother
My daughters life has not been happy I cant tell you But as far as I
am concerned and I think Mrs Kenton too I would be gladWe like you
Mr Breckon We think you are a good man

Oh thank you Im not so sure

Wed risk it But that isnt all Will you excuse me if I dont say
anything more just yetand if I leave you

Why certainly The judge had risen and pushed back his chair and
Breckon did the same And I shallhear from you

Why certainly said the judge in his turn

It isnt possible that you put him off his wife reproached him when
he told what had passed between him and Breckon Oh you couldnt have
let him think that we didnt want him for her Surely you didnt

Will you get it into your head he flamed back that he hasnt spoken
to Ellen yet and I couldnt accept him till she had

Oh yes I forgot that Mrs Kenton struggled with the fact in the
difficulty of realizing so strange an order of procedure I suppose
its his being educated abroad that way But do go back to him Rufus
and tell him that of course

I will do nothing of the kind Sarah What are you thinking of

Oh I dont know what Im thinking of I must see Ellen I suppose
Ill go to her now Oh dear if she doesntif she lets such a chance
slip through her fingersBut shes quite likely to shes so obstinate
I wonder what shell want us to do

She fled to her daughters room and found Boyne there sitting beside
his sisters bed giving her a detailed account of his adventure of
the day before up to the moment Mr Breckon met him in charge of the
detectives Up to that moment it appeared to Boyne as nearly as he
could recollect that he had not broken down but had behaved himself
with a dignity which was now beginning to clothe his whole experience
In the retrospect a quiet heroism characterized his conduct and at the
moment his mother entered the room he was questioning Ellen as to her
impressions of his bearing when she first saw him in the grasp of the
detectives

His mother took him by the arm and said I want to speak with Ellen
Boyne and put him out of the door

Then she came back and sat down in his chair Ellen Mr Breckon has
been speaking to your father Do you know what about

About his going back to New York the girl suggested

Her mother kept her patience with difficulty No not about that About
you Hes asked your fatherI cant understand yet why he did it
only hes so delicate and honorable and goodness known we appreciate
itwhether he can tell you thatthat It was not possible for such
a mother as Mrs Kenton to say He loves you it would have sounded as
she would have said too sickish and she compromised on He likes
you and wants to ask you whether you will marry him And Ellen she
continued in the ample silence which followed if you dont say you
will I will have nothing more to do With such a simpleton I have
always felt that you behaved very foolishly about Mr Bittridge but
I hoped that when you grew older you would see it as we did andand
behave differently And now if after all weve been through with you
you are going to say that you wont have Mr Breckon

Mrs Kenton stopped for want of a figure that would convey all the
disaster that would fall upon Ellen in such an event and she was given
further pause when the girl gently answered Im not going to say that
momma

Then what in the world are you going to say Mrs Kenton demanded

Ellen had turned her face away on the pillow and now she answered
quietly When Mr Breckon asks me I will tell him

Well you had better her mother threatened in return and she did not
realize the falsity of her position till she reported Ellens words to
the judge

Well Sarah I think she had you there he said and Mrs Kenton
then said that she did not care if the child was only going to behave
sensibly at last and she did believe she was

Then its all right said the judge and he took up the Tuskingum
Intelligencer lying till then unread in the excitements which had
followed its arrival the day before and began to read it

Mrs Kenton sat dreamily watching him with her hands fallen in her lap
She suddenly started up with the cry Good gracious What are we all
thinking of

Kenton stared at her over the top of his paper How thinking of

Why Mr Breckon He must be crazy to know what weve decided poor
fellow

Oh said the judge folding the Intelligencer on his knee I had
forgotten Somehow I thought it was all settled

Mrs Kenton took his paper from him and finished folding it It hasnt
begun to be settled You must go and let him know

Wont he look me up the judge suggested

You must look him up Go at once dear Think how anxious he must be

Kenton was not sure that Breckon looked very anxious when he found him
on the brick promenade before the Kurhaus apparently absorbed in noting
the convulsions of a large round German lady in the water who must
have supposed herself to be bathing But perhaps the young man did not
see her the smile on his face was too vague for such an interest when
he turned at Kentons approaching steps

The judge hesitated for an instant in which the smile left Breckons
face I believe thats all right Mr Breckon he said Youll find
Mrs Kenton in our parlor and then the two men parted with an Oh
thank you from Breckon who walked back towards the hotel and left
Kenton to ponder upon the German lady as soon as he realized that she
was not a barrel the judge continued his walk along the promenade
feeling rather ashamed

Mrs Kenton had gone to Ellens room again when she had got the judge
off upon his mission She rather flung in upon her Oh you are up
she apologized to Ellens back The girls face was towards the glass
and she was tilting her head to get the effect of the hat on it which
she now took off

I suppose poppas gone to tell him she said sitting tremulously
down

Didnt you want him to her mother asked stricken a little at sight
of her agitation

Yes I wanted him to but that doesnt make it any easier It makes it
harder Momma

Well Ellen

You know youve got to tell him first

Tell him Mrs Kenton repeated but she knew what Ellen meant

AboutMr Bittridge All about it Every single thing About his
kissing me that night

At the last demand Mrs Kenton was visibly shaken in her invisible
assent to the girls wish Dont you think Ellen that you had better
tell him thatsome time

No now And you must tell him You let me go to the theatre with him
The faintest shadow of resentment clouded the girls face but still
Mrs Kenton thought she knew her own guilt could not yield

Why Ellen she pleaded not without a reproachful sense of vulgarity
in such a plea dont you suppose HE everkissed any one

That doesnt concern me momma said Ellen without a trace of
consciousness that she was saying anything uncommon If you wont tell
him then that ends it I wont see him

Oh well her mother sighed I will try to tell him But Id rather
be whipped I know hell laugh at me

He wont laugh at you said the girl confidently almost
comfortingly I want him to know everything before I meet him I
dont want to have a single thing on my mind I dont want to think of
myself

Mrs Kenton understood the womansoul that spoke in these words
Well she said with a deep long breath be ready then

But she felt the burden which had been put upon her to be so much more
than she could bear that when she found her husband in their parlor she
instantly resolved to cast it upon him He stood at the window with his
hat on

Has Breckon been here yet he asked

Have you seen him yet she returned

Yes and I thought he was coming right here But perhaps he stopped to
screw his courage up He only knew how little it needed with us

Well now its we whove got to have the courage Or you have Do
you know what Ellen wants to have done Mrs Kenton put it in these
impersonal terms and as a preliminary to shirking her share of the
burden

She doesnt want to have him refused

She wants to have him told all about Bittridge

After a momentary revolt the judge said Well thats right Its like
Ellen

Theres something else thats more like her said Mrs Kenton
indignantly She wants him to told about what Bittridge did that
nightabout him kissing her

The judge looked disgusted with his wife for the word then he looked
aghast About

Yes and she wont have a word to say to him till he is told and
unless he is told she will refuse him

Did she say that

No but I know she will

If she didnt say she would I think we may take the chances that she
wont

No we mustnt take any such chances You must tell him

I No I couldnt manage it I have no tact and it would sound
so confoundedly queer coming from one man to another It would
beindelicate Its something that nobody but a womanWhy doesnt she
tell him herself

She wont She considers it our part and something we ought to do
before he commits himself

Very well then Sarah you must tell him You can manage it so it
wont by soqueer

That is just what I supposed you would say Mr Kenton but I must say
I didnt expect it of you I think its cowardly

Look out Sarah I dont like that word

Oh I suppose youre brave enough when it comes to any kind of danger
But when it comes to taking the brunt of anything unpleasant

It isnt unpleasantits queer

Why do you keep saying that over and over Theres nothing queer about
it Its Ellenish but isnt it right

Its right yes I suppose But its squeamish

I see nothing squeamish about it But I know youre determined to leave
it to me and so I shall do it I dont believe Mr Breckon will think
its queer or squeamish

Ive no doubt hell take it in the right way youll know how to
Kenton looked into his hat which he had taken off and then put it on
again His tone and his manner were sufficiently sneaking and he could
not make them otherwise It was for this reason no doubt that he would
not prolong the interview

Oh yes go said Mrs Kenton as he found himself with his hand on the
door Leave it all to me do and he was aware of skulking out of the
room By the time that it would have taken him so long as to walk to
the top of the grand stairway he was back again Hes coming he said
breathlessly I saw him at the bottom of the stairs Go into your room
and wash your eyes ILL tell him

No no Rufus Let me It will be much better Youll be sure to bungle
it

We must risk that You were quite right Sarah It would have been
cowardly in me to let you do it

Rufus You know I didnt mean it Surely youre not resenting that

No Im glad you made me see it Youre all right Sarah and youll
find that it will all come out all right You neednt be afraid Ill
bungle it I shall use discretion Go

I shall not stir a step from this parlor Youve got back all your
spirit dear said the old wife with young pride in her husband But
I must say that Ellen is putting more upon you than she has any right
to I think she might tell him herself

No its our businessmy business We allowed her to get in for it
Shes quite right about it We must not let him commit himself to her
till he knows the thing that most puts her to shame It isnt enough for
us to say that it was really no shame She feels that it casts a sort of
stainyou know what I mean Sarah and I believe I can make this young
man know If I cant so much the worse for him He shall never see
Ellen again

Oh Rufus

Do you think he would be worthy of her if he couldnt

I think Ellen is perfectly ridiculous

Then that shows that I am right in deciding not to leave this thing to
you I feel as she does about it and I intend that he shall

Do you intend to let her run the chance of losing him

That is what I intend to do

Well then Ill tell you what I am going to stay right here We will
both see him its right for us to do it But at a rap on the parlor
door Mrs Kenton flew to that of her own room which she closed upon her
with a sort of Parthian whimper Oh do be careful Rufus

Whether Kenton was careful or not could never be known from either
Kenton himself or from Breckon The judge did tell him everything and
the young man received the most damning details of Ellens history with
a radiant absence which testified that they fell upon a surface sense
of Kenton and did not penetrate to the allpervading sense of Ellen
herself below At the end Kenton was afraid he had not understood

You understand he said that she could not consent to see you before
you knew just how weak she thought she had been The judge stiffened to
defiance in making this humiliation I dont consider myself that she
was weak at all

Of course not Breckon beamed back at him

I consider that throughout she acted with the greatestgreatestAnd
that in that affair when he behaved with thatthat outrageous
impudence it was because she had misled the scoundrel by her kindness
her forbearance her wish not to do him the least shadow of injustice
but to give him every chance of proving himself worthy of her tolerance
and

The judge choked and Breckon eagerly asked And shall Imay I see her
now

Whyyes the judge faltered If youre sure

What about Breckon demanded

I dont know whether she will believe that I have told you

I will try to convince her Where shall I see her

I will go and tell her you are here I will bring her

Kenton passed into the adjoining room where his wife laid hold of
him almost violently You did it beautifully Rufus she huskily
whispered and I was so afraid you would spoil everything Oh how
manly you were and how perfect he was But now its my turn and I will
go and bring EllenYou will let me wont you

You may do anything you please Sarah I dont want to have any more of
this said the judge from the chair he had dropped into

Well then I will bring her at once said Mrs Kenton staying only
in her gladness to kiss him on his gray head he received her embrace
with a superficial sultriness which did not deceive her

Ellen came back without her mother and as soon as she entered the room
and Breckon realized that she had come alone he ran towards her as if
to take her in his arms But she put up her hand with extended fingers
and held him lightly off

Did poppa tell you she asked with a certain defiance She held her
head up fiercely and spoke steadily but he could see the pulse beating
in her pretty neck

Yes he told me

Andwell

Oh I love you Ellen

That isnt it Did you care

Breckon had an inspiration an inspiration from the truth that dwelt at
the bottom of his soul and had never yet failed to save him He let his
arms fall and answered desperately Yes I did I wished it hadnt
happened He saw the pulse in her neck cease to beat and he swiftly
added But I know that it happened just because you were yourself and
were so

If you had said you didnt care she breathlessly whispered I would
never have spoken to you He felt a conditional tremor creeping into
the fingers which had been so rigid against his breast I dont see how
I lived through it Do you think you can

I think so he returned with a faint far suggestion of levity that
brought from her an imperative imploring

Dont

Then he added solemnly It had no more to do with you Ellen than an
offence from some hateful animal

Oh how good you are The fingers folded themselves and her arms
weakened so that there was nothing to keep him from drawing her to him
Whatwhat are you doing she asked with her face smothered against
his

Oh Ellen Ellen Ellen Oh my love my dearest my best

But I have been such a fool she protested imagining that she was
going to push him from her but losing herself in him more and more

Yes yes darling I know it Thats why I love you so




XXVI

There is just one thing said the judge as he wound up his watch that
night that makes me a little uneasy still

Mrs Kenton already in her bed turned her face upon him with a
despairing Tchk Dear What is it I thought we had talked over
everything

We havent got Lotties consent yet

Well I think I see myself asking Lottie Mrs Kenton began before
she realized her husbands irony She added How could you give me such
a start

Well Lottie has bossed us so long that I couldnt help mentioning it
said the judge

It was a lame excuse and in its most potential implication his
suggestion proved without reason If Lottie never gave her explicit
approval to Ellens engagement she never openly opposed it She treated
it rather with something like silent contempt as a childish weakness
on Ellens part which was beneath her serious consideration Towards
Breckon her behavior hardly changed in the severity which she had
assumed from the moment she first ceased to have any use for him I
suppose I will have to kiss him she said gloomily when her mother
told her that he was to be her brother and she performed the rite with
as much coldness as was ever put in that form of affectionate welcome
It is doubtful if Breckon perfectly realized its coldness he never
knew how much he enraged her by acting as if she were a little girl
and saying lightly almost trivially Im so glad youre going to be a
sister to me

With Ellen Lottie now considered herself quits and from the first hour
of Ellens happiness she threw off all the care with all the apparent
kindness which she had used towards her when she was a morbid invalid
Here again if Lottie had minded such a thing she might have been as
much vexed by Ellens attitude as by Breckons Ellen never once noticed
the withdrawal of her anxious oversight or seemed in the least to miss
it As much as her meek nature would allow she arrogated to herself
the privileges and prerogatives of an elder sister and if it had been
possible to make Lottie ever feel like a chit there were moments when
Ellens behavior would have made her feel like a chit It was not till
after their return to Tuskingum that Lottie took her true place in
relation to the affair and in the preparations for the wedding which
she appointed to be in the First Universalist Church overruling both
her mothers and sisters preferences for a home wedding that Lottie
rose in due authority Mrs Kenton had not ceased to feel quelled
whenever her younger daughter called her mother instead of momma and
Ellen seemed not really to care She submitted the matter to Breckon
who said Oh yes if Lottie wishes and he laughed when Ellen
confessed Well I said we would

With the lifting of his great anxiety he had got back to that lightness
which was most like him and he could not always conceal from Lottie
herself that he regarded her as a joke She did not mind it she said
from such a mere sop as in the vast content of his love he was

This was some months after Lottie had got at Scheveningen from Mr
Plumpton that letter which decided her that she had no use for him
There came the same day and by the same post with it a letter from one
of her young men in Tuskingum who had faithfully written to her all
the winter before and had not intermitted his letters after she went
abroad To Kenton he had always seemed too wise if not too good for
Lottie but Mrs Kenton who had her own doubts of Lottie would not
allow this when it came to the question and said woundedly that she
did not see why Lottie was not fully his equal in every way

Well the judge suggested she isnt the first young lawyer at the
Tuskingum bar

Well I wouldnt wish her to be said Mrs Kenton who did not often
make jokes

Well I dont know that I would her husband assented and he added
Pretty good Sarah

Lottie her mother summed up is practical and she is very neat She
wont let Mr Elroy go around looking so slovenly I hope she will make
him have his hair cut and not look as if it were bitten off And I
dont believe hes had his boots blacked since

He was born the judge proposed and she assented

Yes She is very saving and he is wasteful It will be a very good
match You can let them build on the other corner of the lot if Ellen
is going to be in New York I would miss Lottie more than Ellen about
the housekeeping though the dear knows I will miss them both badly
enough

Well you can break off their engagements said the judge

As yet and until Ellen was off her hands Lottie would not allow Mr
Elroy to consider himself engaged to her His conditional devotion did
not debar him from a lovers rights and until Breckon came on from
New York to be married there was much more courtship of Lottie than
of Ellen in the house But Lottie saved herself in the form if not the
fact and as far as verbal terms were concerned she was justified by
them in declaring that she would not have another sop hanging round

It was Boyne and Boyne alone who had any misgivings in regard to
Ellens engagement and these were of a nature so recondite that when
he came to impart them to his mother before they left Scheveningen and
while there was yet time for that conclusion which his father suggested
to Mrs Kenton too late Boyne had an almost hopeless difficulty in
stating them His approaches even were so mystical that his mother was
forced to bring him to book sharply

Boyne if you dont tell me right off just what you mean I dont know
what I will do to you What are you driving at for pitys sake Are you
saying that she oughtnt to be engaged to Mr Breckon

No Im not saying that momma said Boyne in a distress that caused
his mother to take a reef in her impatience

Well what are you saying then

Why you know how Ellen is momma You know how conscientious
andandsensitive Or I dont mean sensitive exactly

Well

Well I dont think she ought to be engaged to Mr Breckon out
ofgratitude

Gratitude

Yes I just know that she thinksor it would be just like herthat he
saved me that day But he only met me about a second before we came
to her and poppa and the officers were taking me right along towards
them Mrs Kenton held herself stormily in and he continued I know
that he translated for us before the magistrate but the magistrate
could speak a little English and when he saw poppa he saw that it was
all right anyway I dont want to say anything against Mr Breckon and
I think he behaved as well any one could but if Ellen is going to marry
him out of gratitude for saving me

Mrs Kenton could hold in no longer And is this what youve been
bothering the life half out of me for for the last hour

Well I thought you ought to look at it in that light momma

Well Boyne said his mother sometimes I think youre almost a
fool and she turned her back upon her son and left him

Boynes place in the Kenton family for which he continued to have
the highest regard became a little less difficult a little less
incompatible with his selfrespect as time went on His spirit which
had lagged a little after his body in stature began as his father
said to catch up He no longer nourished it so exclusively upon
heroical romance as he had during the past year and after his return
to Tuskingum he went into his brother Richards once and manifested a
certain curiosity in the study of the law He read Blackstone and could
give a fair account of his impressions of English law to his father
He had quite outlived the period of entomological research and he
presented his collections of insects somewhat motheaten to his
nephew on whom he also bestowed his postagestamp album Mary Kenton
accepted them in trust the nephew being of yet too tender years for
their care In the preoccupations of his immediate family with Ellens
engagement Boyne became rather close friends with his sisterinlaw
and there were times when he was tempted to submit to her judgment the
question whether the young Queen of Holland did not really beckon to him
that day But pending the hour when he foresaw that Lottie should come
out with the whole story in some instant of excitement Boyne had not
quite the heart to speak of his experience It assumed more and more
respectability with him and lost that squalor which had once put him to
shame while it was yet new He thought that Mary might be reasoned into
regarding him as the hero of an adventure but he is still hesitating
whether to confide in her In the meantime she knows all about it Mary
and Richard both approved of Ellens choice though they are somewhat
puzzled to make out just what Mr Breckons religion is and what his
relations to his charge in New York may be These do not seem to them
quite pastoral and he himself shares their uncertainty But since his
flock does not include Mrs Rasmith and her daughter he is content to
let the question remain in abeyance The Rasmiths are settled in Rome
with an apparent permanency which they have not known elsewhere for a
long time and they have both joined in the friendliest kind of letter
on his marriage to their former pastor if that was what Breckon was
They have professed to know from the first that he was in love with
Ellen and that he is in love with her now is the strong present belief
of his flock if they are a flock and if they may be said to have
anything so positive as a belief in regard to anything

Judge Kenton has given the Elroys the other corner of the lot and
has supplied them the means of building on it Mary and Lottie run
diagonally into the homehouse every day and nothing keeps either from
coming into authority over the old people except the fear of each other
in which they stand The Kentons no longer make any summer journeys but
in the winter they take Boyne and go to see Ellen in New York They do
not stay so long as Mrs Kenton would like As soon as they have fairly
seen the Breckons and have settled comfortably down in their pleasant
house on West Seventyfourth Street she detects him in a secret habit
of sighing which she recognizes as the worst symptom of homesickness
and then she confides to Ellen that she supposes Mr Kenton will
make her go home with him before long Ellen knows it is useless
to interfere She even encourages her fathers longings so far as
indulging his clandestine visits to the seedsmans and she goes with
him to pick up secondhand books about Ohio in the War at the dealers
who remember the judge very flatteringly

As February draws on towards March it becomes impossible to detain
Kenton His wife and son return with him to Tuskingum where Lottie
has seen to the kindling of a good fire in the furnace against their
arrival and has nearly come to blows with Mary about provisioning them
for the first dinner Then Mrs Kenton owns with a comfort which she
will not let her husband see that there is no place like home and they
take up their life in the place where they have been so happy and so
unhappy He reads to her a good deal at night and they play a game
of checkers usually before they go to bed she still cheats without
scruple for as she justly says he knows very well that she cannot
bear to be beaten

The colonel as he is still invariably known to his veterans works
pretty faithfully at the regimental autobiography and drives round the
country picking up material among them in a buggy plastered with
mud He has imagined since his last visit to Breckon who dictates his
sermons if they are sermons taking a stenographer with him and the
young lady who is in deadly terror of the colonels driving is of the
greatest use to him in the case of veterans who will not or cannot
give down as they say in their dairycountry parlance and has already
rescued many reminiscences from perishing in their faltering memories
She writes them out in the judges library when the colonel gets home
and his wife sometimes surprises Mr Kenton correcting them there at
night after she supposes he has gone to bed

Since it has all turned out for the best concerning Bittridge she no
longer has those pangs of selfreproach for Richards treatment of
him which she suffered while afraid that if the fact came to Ellens
knowledge it might make her refuse Breckon She does not find her
daughters behavior in the matter so anomalous as it appears to the
judge

He is willing to account for it on the ground of that inconsistency
which he has observed in all human behavior but Mrs Kenton is not
inclined to admit that it is so very inconsistent She contends that
Ellen had simply lived through that hateful episode of her psychological
history as she was sure to do sooner or later and as she was destined
to do as soon as some other person arrived to take her fancy

If this is the crude commonsense view of the matter Ellen herself is
able to offer no finer explanation which shall at the same time be more
thorough She and her husband have not failed to talk the affair over
with that fulness of treatment which young married people give their
past when they have nothing to conceal from each other She has
attempted to solve the mystery by blaming herself for a certain
essential levity of nature which under all her appearance of gravity
sympathized with levity in others and for what she knows to the
contrary with something ignoble and unworthy in them Breckon of
course does not admit this but he has suggested that she was first
attracted to him by a certain unseriousness which reminded her of
Bittridge in enabling him to take her seriousness lightly This is the
logical inference which he makes from her theory of herself but she
insists that it does not follow and she contends that she was moved to
love him by an instant sense of his goodness which she never lost and
in which she was trying to equal herself with him by even the desperate
measure of renouncing her happiness if that should ever seem her duty
to his perfection He says this is not very clear though it is awfully
gratifying and he does not quite understand why Mrs Bittridges letter
should have liberated Ellen from her fancied obligations to the past
Ellen can only say that it did so by making her so ashamed ever to have
had anything to do with such people and making her see how much she had
tried her father and mother by her folly This again Breckon contends
is not clear but he says we live in a universe of problems in which
another more or less does not much matter He is always expecting
that some chance shall confront him with Bittridge and that the mans
presence will explain everything for like so many Ohio people who
leave their native State the Bittridges have come East instead of going
West in quitting the neighborhood of Tuskingum He is settled with his
idolized mother in New York where he is obscurely attached to one of
the newspapers That he has as yet failed to rise from the ranks in
the great army of assignment men may be because moral quality tells
everywhere and to be a clever blackguard is not so well as to be simply
clever If ever Breckon has met his alter ego as he amuses himself in
calling him he has not known it though Bittridge may have been wiser
in the case of a man of Breckons publicity not to call it distinction
There was a time immediately after the Breckons heard from Tuskingum
that the Bittridges were in New York when Ellens husband consulted her
as to what might be his duty towards her late suitor in the event which
has not taken place and when he suggested not too seriously that
Richards course might be the solution To his suggestion Ellen
answered Oh no dear That was wrong and this remains also Richards
opinion
