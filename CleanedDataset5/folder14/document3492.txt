HOMESPUN TALES

By Kate Douglas Wiggin




Introduction

These three stories are now brought together under one cover because
they have not quite outworn their welcome but in their first estate
two of them appeared as giftbooks with decorative borders and wide
margins a style not compatible with the stringent economies of
the present moment Luckily they belong together by reason of their
background which is an imaginary village any village you choose
within the confines or on the borders of York County in the State of
Maine

In the first tale the river not Rose is the principal character no
one realizes this better than I If an author spends her summers on
the banks of Saco Water it fills the landscape It flows from the White
Mountains to the Atlantic in a tempestuous torrent breaking here and
there into glorious falls of amber glimpsed through snowy foam its
rapids dash through rocky cliffs crowned with pine trees under which
blue harebells and rosy columbines blossom in gay profusion There is
the glint of the mirrorlike lake above the falls and the sound of the
surging floods below the witchery of feathery elms reflected in its
clear surfaces and the enchantment of the full moon on its golden
torrents never twice alike and always beautiful How is one to forget
evade scorn belittle it by leaving its charms untold and who could
keep such a river out of a book It has flowed through many of mine
and the last sound I expect to hear in life will be the faint faraway
murmur of Saco Water

The old Tory Hill Meeting House bulks its way into the foreground of the
next story and the old Peabody Pew which never existed has somehow
assumed a quasihistorical aspect never intended by its author There
is a Dorcas Society and there is a meeting house my dedication assures
the reader of these indubitable facts and the Dorcas Society in a
season of temporary bankruptcy succeeding a too ample generosity
did scrub the pews when there was no money for paint Rumors of our
strenuous and somewhat unique activities spread through our parish
to many others traveling so far even over seas that we became
embarrassed at our easily won fame The book was read and people
occasionally came to church to see the old Peabody Pew rather resenting
the information that there had never been any Peabodys in the parish
and therefore there could be no Peabody Pew Matters became worse
when I made very reverently what I suppose must be called a dramatic
version of the book which we have played for several summers in the old
meeting house to audiences far exceeding our seating capacity Inasmuch
as the imaginary lovetale of my socalled Nancy Wentworth and Justin
Peabody had begun under the shadow of the church steeple and after the
ten years of parting the happy reunion had come to them in the selfsame
place it was possible to present their story simply and directly
without offense in a church building There was no curtain no stage
no scenery no theatricalism The pulpit was moved back and four young
pine trees were placed in front of it for supposed Christmas decoration
The pulpit platform and the wing pews left vacant for the village
players took the place of a stage the two aisles served for exits and
entrances and the sexton with three rings of the church bell announced
the scenes The Carpet Committee of the Dorcas Society furnished the
exposition of the first act while sewing the last breadths of the new
hardlybought ingrain carpet The scrubbing of the pews ends the act
with dialogue concerning men women ministers churchmembers and their
ways including the utter failure of Justin Peabody Nancys hero to
make a living anywhere even in the West The Dorcas members leave the
church for their Saturday night suppers of beans and brown bread but
Nancy returns with her lantern at nightfall to tack down the carpet in
the old Peabody pew and iron out the tattered dogs eared leaves of the
hymnbook from which she has so often sung By cool Siloams shady rill
with her lover in days gone by He still a failure having waited for
years for his luck to turn has come back to spend Christmas in the home
of his boyhood and seeing a dim light in the church he enters quietly
and surprises Nancy at her task of carpeting the Peabody Pew so that
it shall look as well as the others at next days services The rest
is easy to imagine One can deny the reality of a book but when two or
three thousand people have beheld Justin Peabody and Nancy Wentworth in
the flesh and have seen the paint of the old Peabody Pew wiped with
a damp cloth its cushion darned and its carpet tacked in place it is
useless to argue any more than it would be to deny the validity of the
egg of Columbus or the apple of William Tell

As for Susanna and Sue the story would never have been written had I
not as a child and girl been driven once a year to the Shaker meeting at
the little village of Alfred sixteen miles distant The services were
then open to the public but eventually permission to attend them was
withdrawn because of the careless and sometimes irreverent behavior
of young people who regarded the Shaker costumes the solemn dances
or marches the rhythmic movements of the hands the almost hypnotic
crescendo of the singing as a sort of humorous spectacle I learned
to know the brethren and sisters and the Elder as years went by
and often went to the main house to spend a day or two as the guest of
Eldress Harriet a saint if ever there was one or later with dear
Sister Lucinda

The shining cleanliness and order the frugality and industry the
serenity and peace of these people who had resigned the world and
life on the plane of Adam vowing themselves to celibacy to public
confession of sins and the holding of goods in commonall this has
always had a certain exquisite and helpful influence upon my thought
and Mr W D Howells paid a far more beautiful tribute to them in The
Undiscovered Country

It is needless to say that I read every word of the book to my Shaker
friends before it was published They took a deep interest in it
evincing keen delight in my rather facetious but wholly imaginary
portrait of Brother Ansel a born Shaker and sadly confessing that
my two young lovers Hetty and Nathan who could not endure the
rigors of the Shaker faith and fled together in the night to marry and
join the worlds peoplethat this tragedy had often occurred in their
community

Here then are the three simple homespun tales I believe they are true
to life as I see it I only wish my readers might hear the ripple of the
Maine river running through them breathe the fragrance of New England
forests and though never for a moment getting through my poor pen
the atmosphere of Maines rugged cliffs and the tang of her salt sea
air they might at least believe for an instant that they had found a
modest Mayflower in her pine woods

ROSE O THE RIVER




I The Pine And the Rose


It was not long after sunrise and Stephen Waterman fresh from his
dip in the river had scrambled up the hillside from the hut in the
alderbushes where he had made his morning toilet

An early ablution of this sort was not the custom of the farmers along
the banks of the Saco but the Waterman house was hardly a stones throw
from the water and there was a clear deep swimminghole in the Willow
Cove that would have tempted the busiest man or the least cleanly in
York County Then too Stephen was a child of the river born reared
schooled on its very brink never happy unless he were on it or in it
or beside it or at least within sight or sound of it

The immensity of the sea had always silenced and overawed him left him
cold in feeling The river wooed him caressed him won his heart
It was just big enough to love It was full of charms and changes of
varying moods and sudden surprises Its voice stole in upon his ear with
a melody far sweeter and more subtle than the boom of the ocean Yet it
was not without strength and when it was swollen with the freshets of
the spring and brimming with the bounty of its sister streams it could
dash and roar boom and crash with the best of them

Stephen stood on the side porch drinking in the glory of the sunrise
with the Saco winding like a silver ribbon through the sweet loveliness
of the summer landscape

And the river rolled on toward the sea singing its morning song
creating and nourishing beauty at every step of its onward path Cradled
in the heart of a great mountainrange it pursued its gleaming way
here lying silent in glassy lakes there rushing into tinkling little
falls foaming great falls and thundering cataracts Scores of bridges
spanned its width but no steamers flurried its crystal depths Here and
there a rough little rowboat tethered to a willow rocked to and fro in
some quiet bend of the shore Here the silver gleam of a rising perch
chub or trout caught the eye there a pickerel lay rigid in the clear
water a fish carved in stone here eels coiled in the muddy bottom
of some pool and there under the deep shadows of the rocks lay fat
sleepy bass old and incredibly wise quite untempted by and wholly
superior to the rural fishermans worm

The river lapped the shores of peaceful meadows it flowed along banks
green with maple beech sycamore and birch it fell tempestuously over
dams and fought its way between rocky cliffs crowned with stately firs
It rolled past forests of pine and hemlock and spruce now gentle
now terrible for there is said to be an Indian curse upon the Saco
whereby with every great sun the child of a paleface shall be drawn
into its cruel depths Lashed into fury by the stony reefs that impeded
its progress the river looked now sapphire now gold now white now
leaden gray but always it was hurrying hurrying on its appointed way
to the sea

After feasting his eyes and filling his heart with a morning draught
of beauty Stephen went in from the porch and pausing at the stairway
called in stentorian tones Get up and eat your breakfast Rufus The
boys will be picking the side jams today and Im going down to work on
the logs If you come along bring your own pickpole and peavey Then
going to the kitchen pantry he collected from the various shelves
a pitcher of milk a loaf of bread half an apple pie and a bowl of
blueberries and with the easy methods of a household unswayed by
feminine rule moved toward a seat under an apple tree and took his
morning meal in great apparent content Having finished and washed his
dishes with much more thoroughness than is common to unsuperintended
man and having given Rufus the second call to breakfast with the vigor
and acrimony that usually mark that unpleasant performance he strode to
a high point on the riverbank and shading his eyes with his hand gazed
steadily downstream

Patches of green fodder and blossoming potatoes melted into soft fields
that had been lately mown and there were glimpses of tasseling corn
rising high to catch the sun Far far down on the opposite bank of the
river was the hint of a brown roof and the tip of a chimney that sent a
slender wisp of smoke into the clear air Beyond this and farther back
from the water the trees apparently hid a cluster of other chimneys
for thin spirals of smoke ascended here and there The little brown
roof could never have revealed itself to any but a lovers eye and that
discerned something even smaller something like a pinkish speck that
moved hither and thither on a piece of greensward that sloped to the
waterside

Shes up Stephen exclaimed under his breath his eyes shining his
lips smiling His voice had a note of hushed exaltation about it as if
she whoever she might be had in condescending to rise conferred a
priceless boon upon a waiting universe If she were indeed up so his
tone implied then the day somewhat falsely heralded by the sunrise
had really begun and the human race might pursue its appointed tasks
inspired and uplifted by the consciousness of her existence It might
properly be grateful for the fact of her birth that she had grown to
womans estate and above all that in common with the sun the lark
the morningglory and other beautiful things of the early day she was
up and about her lovely cheery heartwarming business

The handful of chimneys and the smokespirals rising here and there
among the trees on the riverbank belonged to what was known as the
Brier Neighborhood There were only a few houses in all scattered along
a side road leading from the river up to Liberty Center There were no
great signs of thrift or prosperity but the Wiley cottage the only
one near the water was neat and well cared for and Nature had done her
best to conceal mans indolence poverty or neglect

Bushes of sweetbrier grew in fragrant little forests as tall as the
fences Clumps of wild roses sprang up at every turn and over all the
stone walls as well as on every heap of rocks by the wayside prickly
blackberry vines ran and clambered and clung yielding fruit and thorns
impartially to the neighborhood children

The pinkish speck that Stephen Waterman had spied from his side of the
river was Rose Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood on the Edgewood side As
there was another of her name on Brigadier Hill the Edgewood minister
called one of them the climbing Rose and the other the brier Rose or
sometimes Rose of the river She was well named the pinkish speck She
had not only some of the sweetest attributes of the wild rose but the
parallel might have been extended as far as the thorns for she had
wounded her scoreshearts be it understood not hands The wounding
was on the whole very innocently done and if fault could be imputed
anywhere it might rightly have been laid at the door of the kind powers
who had made her what she was since the smile that blesses a single
heart is always destined to break many more

She had not a single silk gown but she had what is far better a
figure to show off a cotton one Not a brooch nor a pair of earrings was
numbered among her possessions but any ordinary gems would have looked
rather dull and trivial when compelled to undergo comparison with her
bright eyes As to her hair the local milliner declared it impossible
for Rose Wiley to get an unbecoming hat that on one occasion being
in a frolicsome mood Rose had tried on all the headgear in the village
emporiumchildrens gingham Shakers mourning bonnets for aged
dames mens haying hats and visored capsand she proved superior
to every test looking as pretty as a pink in the best ones and simply
ravishing in the worst In fact she had been so fashioned and
finished by Nature that had she been set on a revolving pedestal in a
showwindow the bystanders would have exclaimed as each new charm came
into view Look at her waist See her shoulders And her neck and chin
And her hair While the children gazing with raptured admiration
would have shrieked in unison I choose her for mine

All this is as much as to say that Rose of the river was a beauty yet
it quite fails to explain nevertheless the secret of her power When
she looked her worst the spell was as potent as when she looked her
best Hidden away somewhere was a vital spark which warmed every one
who came in contact with it Her lovely little person was a trifle below
medium height and it might as well be confessed that her soul on the
morning when Stephen Waterman saw her hanging out the clothes on the
riverbank was not large enough to be at all out of proportion but
when eyes and dimples lips and cheeks enslave the onlooker the soul
is seldom subjected to a close or critical scrutiny Besides Rose Wiley
was a nice girl neat as wax energetic merry amiable economical She
was a dutiful granddaughter to two of the most irritating old people
in the county she never patronized her pugnosed pastyfaced girl
friends she made wonderful pies and doughnuts and besides small
souls if they are of the right sort sometimes have a way of growing
to the discomfiture of cynics and the gratification of the angels

So on one bank of the river grew the brier rose a fragile thing
swaying on a slender stalk and looking at its pretty reflection in the
water and on the other a sturdy pine tree well rooted against wind and
storm And the sturdy pine yearned for the wild rose and the rose so
far as it knew yearned for nothing at all certainly not for rugged
pine trees standing tall and grim in rocky soil If in its present
stage of development it gravitated toward anything in particular it
would have been a welldressed white birch growing on an irreproachable
lawn

And the river now deep now shallow now smooth now tumultuous
now sparkling in sunshine now gloomy under clouds rolled on to the
engulfing sea It could not stop to concern itself with the petty
comedies and tragedies that were being enacted along its shores else it
would never have reached its destination Only last night under a full
moon there had been pairs of lovers leaning over the rails of all the
bridges along its course but that was a common sight like that of the
ardent couples sitting on its shady banks these summer days looking
only into each others eyes but exclaiming about the beauty of the
water Lovers would come and go sometimes reappearing with successive
installments of loves in a way wholly mysterious to the river Meantime
it had its own work to do and must be about it for the side jams were
to be broken and the boom let out at the Edgewood bridge




II Old Kennebec


It was just seven oclock that same morning when Rose Wiley smoothed the
last wrinkle from her dimity counterpane picked up a shred of cornhusk
from the spotless floor under the bed slapped a mosquito on the
windowsill removed all signs of murder with a moist towel and before
running down to breakfast cast a frowning look at her pincushion
Almira otherwise Mite Shapley had been in her room the afternoon
before and disturbed with her careless hand the pattern of Roses pins
They were kept religiously in the form of a Maltese cross and if while
she was extricating one from her clothing there had been an alarm
of fire Rose would have stuck the pin in its appointed place in the
design at the risk of losing her life

Entering the kitchen with her light step she brought the morning
sunshine with her The old people had already engaged in differences of
opinion but they commonly suspended open warfare in her presence
There were the usual last things to be done for breakfast offices that
belonged to her as her grandmothers assistant She took yesterdays
soda biscuits out of the steamer where they were warming and softening
brought an apple pie and a plate of seed cakes from the pantry settled
the coffee with a piece of dried fish skin and an egg shell and
transferred some fried potatoes from the spider to a covered dish

Did you remember the meat grandpa Were all out she said as she
began buttoning a stiff collar around his reluctant neck

Remember Land yes I wisht I ever could forgit anything The butcher
says hes bout tired o travelin over the country lookin for critters
to kill but if he finds anything hell be up along in the course of a
week He aint a real smart butcher Cyse Higgins aintLand Rose
dont button that dickey clean through my epperdummis I have to sport
starched collars in this life on account o you and your granmother
bein so chock full o style but I hope to the Lord I shant have to
wear em in another world

You wont his wife responded with the snap of a dish towel or if
you do theyll wilt with the heat

Rose smiled but the soft hand with which she tied the neckcloth about
the old mans withered neck pacified his spirit and he smiled knowingly
back at her as she took her seat at the breakfast table spread near the
open kitchen door She was a dazzling Rose and it is to be feared
a wasted one for there was no one present to observe her clean pink
calico and the still more subtle note struck in the green ribbon which
was tied round her throatthe ribbon that formed a sort of calyx out
of which sprang the flower of her face as fresh and radiant as if it
had bloomed that morning

Give me my coffee turrible quick said Mr Wiley I must be down to
the bridge fore they start dogwarpin the side jam

I notice youre always due at the bridge on churnin days remarked
his spouse testily

T aint me as appints drivin dates at Edgewood replied the old
man The boysll hev a turrible job this year The logs air ricked up
jest like Roses jackstraws I never see em so turrible ricked up in
all my experence an Lije Dennett don know no more bout pickin a
jam than Coopers cow Turrible sot in his ways too cant take a
mite of advice I was tellin him how to go to work on that bung thats
formed between the gret gray rock an the shorethe awfullest place
to bung that there is between this an Biddefordand says he Look
here Ive ben boss on this river for twelve year an Ill be doggoned
if Im goin to be taught my business by any man This aint no
river says I as youd know says I if youd ever lived on the
Kennebec Pity you hed nt stayed on it says he I wish to the land
I hed says I An then I come away for my tongues so turrible spry
an sarcustic that I knew if I stopped any longer I should stir up
strife Theres some folks thatll set on addled aigs year in an year
out as if there want good fresh ones bein laid every day an Lije
Dennetts one of em when it comes to riverdrivin

Theres lots o folks as have made a good livin by mindin their own
business observed the still sententious Mrs Wiley as she speared a
soda biscuit with her fork

Mindin your own business is a turrible selfish trade responded
her husband loftily If your neighbor is more ignorant than what you
areparticlarly if hes as ignorant as Coopers cowyoud ought
as a Kennebec man an a Christian to set him on the right track
though its always a turrible risky thing to do Roses grandfather was
called by the irreverent younger generation sometimes Turrible Wiley
and sometimes Old Kennebec because of the frequency with which these
words appeared in his conversation There were not wanting those of late
who dubbed him Uncle Ananias for reasons too obvious to mention After
a long indolent tolerably truthful and useless life he had at
seventyfive lost sight of the dividing line between fact and fancy
and drew on his imagination to such an extent that he almost staggered
himself when he began to indulge in reminiscence He was a feature of
the Edgewood drive being always present during the five or six days
that it was in progress sometimes sitting on the riverbank sometimes
leaning over the bridge sometimes reclining against the buttend of
a huge log but always chewing tobacco and expectorating to incredible
distances as he criticized and damned impartially all the expedients in
use at the particular moment

I want to stay down by the river this afternoon said Rose Ever
so many of the girls will be there and all my sewing is done up If
grandpa will leave the horse for me Ill take the drivers lunch to
them at noon and bring the dishes back in time to wash them before
supper

I suppose you can go if the rest do said her grandmother though
its an awful lazy way of spendin an afternoon When I was a girl there
was no such dawdlin goin on I can tell you Nobody thought o lookin
at the river in them days there was nt time

But its such fun to watch the logs Rose exclaimed Next to dancing
the greatest fun in the world

Specially as all the young men in town will be there watchin too
was the grandmothers reply Eben Brooks an Richard Bean got home
yesterday with their doctors diplomas in their pockets Mrs Brooks
says Eben stood fortynine in a class o fiftyfive an seemed
considable proud of him an I guess it is the first time he ever stood
anywheres but at the foot I tell you when these fiftyfive new doctors
git scattered over the country therell be considable many folks
keepin house under ground Dick Beans goin to stop a spell with Rufe
an Steve Waterman Thatll make one more to play in the river

Rufus aint hardly got his workin legs on yit allowed Mr Wiley
but Steves all right Hes a turrible smart driver an turrible
reckless too Hell take all the chances there is though to a man
thats lived on the Kennebec there aint what can rightly be called any
turrible chances on the Saco

Hed better be tendin to his farm objected Mrs Wiley

His hay is all in Rose spoke up quickly and he only helps on the
river when the farm work is nt pressing Besides though its all play
to him he earns his two dollars and a half a day

He dont keer about the two and a half said her grandfather He jest
cant keep away from the logs Theres some that cant When I first
moved here from Gardner where the climate never suited me


The climate of any place where you hev regular work never did an
never will suit you remarked the old mans wife but the interruption
received no comment such mistaken views of his character were too
frequent to make any impression

As I was sayin Rose he continued when we first moved here from
Gardner we lived neighbor to the Watermans Steve an Rufus was little
boys then always playin with a couple o wild cousins o theirn
considable older Steve would scare his mother pretty nigh to death
stealin away to the mill to ride on the carriage side o the log
that was bein sawed hitchin clean out over the river an then jerkin
back most into the jaws o the machinery

He never hed any common sense to spare even when he was a young one
remarked Mrs Wiley and I dont see as all the cademy education
his father throwed away on him has changed him much And with this
observation she rose from the table and went to the sink

Steve aint nobodys fool dissented the old man but hes kind o
daft about the river When he was little he was allers buildin dams in
the brook an sailin chips an runnin on the logs allers choppin
up stickins an raftin em together in the pond I cailate Mis
Waterman died considable afore her time jest from fright lookin out
the winders and seein her boys slippin between the logs an gittin
their daily dousin She could nt understand it an theres a heap o
things womenfolks never do an never can understandjest because they
_air_ womenfolks

One o the things is men I spose interrupted Mrs Wiley

Men in general but more particlarly husbands assented Old Kennebec
howsomever theres another thing they dont an cant never take in
an thats sport Steve does riverdrivin as he would horseracin or
tigershootin or tightrope dancin an he always did from a boy When
he was about twelve to fifteen he used to help the riverdrivers spring
and fall reglar He could nt do nothin but shin up an down the
rocks after hammers an hatchets an ropes but he was turrible
pleased with his job Stepanfetchit they used to call him them
daysStepanfetchit Waterman

Good name for him yet came in acid tones from the sink Hes still
steppin an fetchin only its Rose thats doin the drivin now

Im not driving anybody that I know of answered Rose with
heightened color but with no loss of her habitual selfcommand

Then when he graduated from errants went on the crafty old man who
knew that when breakfast ceased churning must begin Steve used to
get seventyfive cents a day helpin clear up the riverif you can call
this here silvry streamlet a river Hed pick off a log here an there
an send it afloat an dig out them that hed got ketched in the rocks
and tidy up the banks jest like spring housecleanin If hed hed any
kind of a boss an hed ben trained on the Kennebec hed a made a
turrible smart driver Steve would

Hell be drownded thats whatll become o him prophesied Mrs Wiley
specially if Rose encourages him in such silly foolishness as ridin
logs from his house down to ourn dark nights

Seein as how Steve built ye a nice pigpen last month pears to me
you might have a good word for him now an then mother remarked Old
Kennebec reaching for his second piece of pie

I want a mite deceived by that pigpen no moren I was by Jed Towles
hencoop nor Ivory Dunns wellcurb nor Pitt Packards shedsteps If
you hed ever kep up your buildins yourself Roses beaux would nt hev
to do their courtin with carpenters tools

Its the pigpen an the hencoop you want to keep your eye on mother
not the motives of them as made em Its turrible onsettlin to inspeck
folks motives too turrible close

Riding a log is no more to Steve than riding a horse so he says
interposed Rose to change the subject but I tell him that a horse
does nt revolve under you and go sideways at the same time that it is
going forwards

Logridin aint no trick at all to a man of sperit said Mr Wiley
Theres a few places in the Kennebec where the waters too shaller to
let the logs float so we used to build a flume an the logs would whiz
down like arrers shot from a bow The boys used to collect by the side
o that there flume to see me ride a log down an Ive watched em drop
in a dead faint when I spun by the crowd but land you cant drownd
some folks not without you tie nailkags to their head an feet an
drop em in the falls Ive rid logs down the bilinest rapids o the
Kennebec an never lost my head I remember well the year o the gret
freshet I rid a log from

There there father thatll do said Mrs Wiley decisively Ill
put the cream in the churn an you jest work off some o your steam by
bringin the butter for us afore you start for the bridge It dont
do no good to brag afore your own womenfolks work goes considable
bettern stories at every place cept the loafers bench at the tavern

And the baffled raconteur who had never done a piece of work cheerfully
in his life dragged himself reluctantly to the shed where before
long one could hear him moving the dasher up and down sedately to his
favorite churning tune of

 Broad is the road that leads to death
 And thousands walk together there
 But Wisdom shows a narrow path
 With here and there a traveler




III The Edgewood Drive


Just where the bridge knits together the two little villages of Pleasant
River and Edgewood the glassy mirror of the Saco broadens suddenly
sweeping over the dam in a luminous torrent Gushes of pure amber mark
the middle of the dam with crystal and silver at the sides and from
the seething vortex beneath the golden cascade the white spray dashes
up in fountains In the crevices and hollows of the rocks the mad water
churns itself into snowy froth while the foamflecked torrent deep
strong and troubled to its heart sweeps majestically under the bridge
then dashes between wooded shores piled high with steep masses of rock
or torn and riven by great gorges

There had been much rain during the summer and the Saco was very
high so on the third day of the Edgewood drive there was considerable
excitement at the bridge and a goodly audience of villagers from both
sides of the river There were some who never came some who had no
fancy for the sight some to whom it was an old story some who were
too busy but there were many to whom it was the event of events a
neverending source of interest

Above the fall covering the placid surface of the river thousands of
logs lay quietly in boom until the turning out process on the last
day of the drive should release them and give them their chance
of display their brief moment of notoriety their opportunity of
interesting amusing exciting and exasperating the onlookers by their
antics

Heaps of logs had been cast up on the rocks below the dam where they
lay in hopeless confusion adding nothing however to the problem of
the moment for they too bided their time If they had possessed wisdom
discretion and caution they might have slipped gracefully over the
falls and steering clear of the hidden ledges about which it would
seem they must have heard whispers from the old pine trees along the
river have kept a straight course and reached their destination
without costing the Edgewood Lumber Company a small fortune Or if
they had inclined toward a jolly and adventurous career they could have
joined one of the various jams or bungs stimulated by the thought
that any one of them might be a keylog holding for a time the entire
mass in its despotic power But they had been stranded early in the
game and after lying high and dry for weeks would be picked off one
by one and sent downstream

In the tumultuous boil the foaming hubbub and flurry at the foot of
the falls one enormous peeled log wallowed up and clown like a huge
rhinoceros greatly pleasing the children by its clumsy cavortings Some
conflict of opposing forces kept it ever in motion yet never set it
free Below the bridge were always the real battlegrounds the scenes
of the first and the fiercest conflicts A ragged ledge of rock
standing well above the yeasty torrent marked the middle of the
river Stephen had been stranded there once just at dusk on a stormy
afternoon in spring A jam had broken under the men and Stephen having
taken too great risks had been caught on the moving mass and leaping
from log to log his only chance for life had been to find a footing on
Gray Rock which was nearer than the shore

Rufus was ill at the time and Mrs Waterman so anxious and nervous
that processions of boys had to be sent up to the River Farm giving the
frightened mother the latest bulletins of her sons welfare Luckily
the river was narrow just at the Gray Rock and it was a quite possible
task though no easy one to lash two ladders together and make a narrow
bridge on which the drenched and shivering man could reach the shore
There were loud cheers when Stephen ran lightly across the slender
pathway that led to safetyran so fast that the ladders had scarce time
to bend beneath his weight He had certainly taken chances but when
did he not do that The loggers life is one of moving accidents by
flood and field and Stephen welcomed with wild exhilaration every
hazard that came in his path To him there was never a dull hour from
the moment that the first notch was cut in the tree for he sometimes
joined the boys in the lumber camp just for a frolic till the later
one when the hewn log reached its final destination He knew nothing
of tooling a fourinhand through narrow lanes or crowded
thoroughfaresnothing of guiding a horse over the hedges and through
the pitfalls of a stiff bit of hunting country his steed was the
rearing plunging kicking log and he rode it like a river god

The crowd loves daring and so it welcomed Stephen with bravos but it
knew as he knew that he was only doing his duty by the Company only
showing the Saco that man was master only keeping the old Waterman name
in good repute Ye cant drownd some folks Old Kennebec had said as
he stood in a group on the shore not without you tie sandbags to em
an drop em in the Great Eddy Im the same kind I remember when I was
stranded on jest sech a rock in the Kennebec only they left me there
all night for dead an I had to swim the rapids when it come daylight

Were well acquainted with that rock and them rapids exclaimed one of
the riverdrivers to the delight of the company

Rose had reason to remember Stephens adventure for he had clambered
up the bank smiling and blushing under the hurrahs of the boys and
coming to the wagon where she sat waiting for her grandfather had
seized a moment to whisper Did you care whether I came across safe
Rose Say you did

Stephen recalled that question too on this August morning perhaps
because this was to be a redletter day and some time when he had a
free momentsome time before supper when he and Rose were sitting
apart from the others watching the logshe intended again to ask her
to marry him This thought trembled in him stirring the deeps of his
heart like a great wave almost sweeping him off his feet when he held
it too close and let it have full sway It would be the fourth time
that he had asked Rose this question of all questions but there was
no unerceptible difference in his excitement for there was always the
possible chance that she might change her mind and say yes if only for
variety Wanting a thing continuously unchangingly unceasingly year
after year he thoughtlonging to reach it as the river longed to
reach the seasuch wanting might in course of time mean having

Rose drove up to the bridge with the mens luncheon and the under boss
came up to take the baskets and boxes from the back of the wagon

Weve had a reglar tussle this mornin Rose he said The logs
are determined not to move Ike Billings thats the hansomest and
fluentest allround swearer on the Saco has tried his best on the side
jam Hes all out o cusswords and there haint a log budged Now stid
o dogwarpin this afternoon an lettin the oxen haul off all them
stubborn logs by main force were goin to ask you to set up on the
bank and smile at the jam Land she can do it says Ike a minute ago
When Rose starts smilin he says there aint a jam nor a bung in
_me_ that dont melt like wax and jest float right off same as the logs
do when they get into quiet sunny water

Rose blushed and laughed and drove up the hill to Mite Shapleys where
she put up the horse and waited till the men had eaten their luncheon
The drivers slept and had breakfast and supper at the Billings house a
mile downriver but for several years Mrs Wiley had furnished the
noon meal sending it down piping hot on the stroke of twelve The boys
always said that up or down the whole length of the Saco there was
no such cooking as the Wileys and much of this praise was earned by
Roses serving It was the old grandmother who burnished the tin
plates and dippers till they looked like silver forcrotchety and
sharptongued as she wasshe never allowed Rose to spoil her hands with
soft soap and sand but it was Rose who planned and packed Rose who
hemmed squares of old white tablecloths and sheets to line the baskets
and keep things daintily separate Rose also whose tarts and cakes
were the pride and admiration of church sociables and sewing societies

Where could such smoking pots of beans be found A murmur of ecstatic
approval ran through the crowd when the covers were removed Pieces of
sweet homefed pork glistened like varnished mahogany on the top of the
beans and underneath were such deeps of fragrant juice as come only
from slow fires and long quiet hours in brick ovens Who else could
steam and bake such mealy loaves of brown bread brown as plumpudding
yet with no suspicion of sogginess Who such soda biscuits big
feathery tasting of cream and hardly needing butter And greenapple
pies Could such candied lower crusts be found elsewhere or more
delectable filling Or such rich nutty doughnutsdoughnuts that had
spurned the hot fat which is the ruin of so many and risen from its
waves like goldenbrown Venuses

By the great seleckmen ejaculated Jed Towle as he swallowed his
fourth Id like to hev a wife two daughters and four sisters like
them Wileys and jest set still on the riverbank an hev em cook
victuals for me Id hev nothin to wish for then but a mouth as big as
the Sacos

And I wish this custard pie was the size o Bonnie Eagle Pond said
Ike Billings Id like to fall into the middle of it and eat my way
out

Look at that bunch o Chiny asters tied on t the bail o that
biscuitpail said Ivory Dunn Thats the girls doins you bet
womenfolks dont seem to make no boquets after they git married Lets
divide em up an wear em drivin this afternoon mebbe theyll ketch
the eye so t our rags wont show so bad Land its lucky my hundred
days is about up If I dont git home soon I shall be arrested for
goin without cloes I set up bout all night puttin these blue
patches in my pants an tryin to piece together a couple of old
redflannel shirts to make one whole one Thats the worst o drivin in
these places where the pretty girls make a habit of comin down to the
bridge to see the fun You hev to keep rigged up jest so stylish you
cant git no chance at the rum bottle an you even hev to go a leetle
mite light on swearin




IV Blasphemious Swearin

Steve Watermans an awful nice feller exclaimed Ivory Dunn just
then Stephen had been looking intently across the river watching the
Shapleys side door from which Rose might issue at any moment and at
this point in the discussion he had lounged away from the group and
moving toward the bridge began to throw pebbles idly into the water

Hes an awful smart driver for one that dont foller drivin the
year round continued Ivory and hes the awfullest cleanspoken
softspoken feller I ever see

Theres ben two black sheep in his family aready an Steve kind
o feels as if hed ought to be extry white remarked Jed Towle You
fellers that belonged to the old drive remember Pretty Quick Waterman
well enough Steves mother brought him up

Yes most of them remembered the Waterman twins Stephens cousins now
both deadSlow Waterman so moderate in his steps and actions that you
had to fix a landmark somewhere near him to see if he moved and Pretty
Quick who shone by comparison with his twin Id kind o forgot that
Pretty Quick Waterman was cousin to Steve said the under boss he
never worked with me much but he want cut off the same piece o goods
as the other Watermans Great hemlock but he kep a cussin dictionary
Pretty Quick did Whenever he heard any new words he must a writ em
down an then studied em all up in the wintertime to use in the
spring drive

Swearin s a habit that hed ought to be practiced with turrible
caution observed old Mr Wiley when the drivers had finished luncheon
and taken out their pipes Theres three kinds o swearinplain
swearin profane swearin an blasphemious swearin Logs air jest
like mules theres times when a man cant seem to rip up a jam in good
style thout a few words thats too strong for the infant classes in
Sundayschools but a man hed nt ought to tempt Providence When hes
ridin a log near the falls at high water or cuttin the keylog in a
jam he aint in no place for blasphemious swearin jest a little
easy perlite damn is bout all he can resk if he dont want to git
drownded an hev his ghost walkin the riverbanks till kingdom come

You an I Long was the only ones that seen Pretty Quick go want
we continued Old Kennebec glancing at Long Abe Dennett cousin to
Short Abe who lay on his back in the grass the smokewreaths rising
from his pipe and the steel spikes in his heavy calkedsole boots
shining in the sun

There was folks on the bridge Long answered but we was the only
ones near enough to see an hear It was so onexpected an so soon
over that them as was watchin upstream where the men was to work on
the falls would nt a hed time to see him go down But I did an
nobody aint heard me swear sence though its ten years ago I allers
said it was rum an bravadder that killed Pretty Quick Waterman that
day The boys hed nt give him a dare that he hed nt took up He
seemed like he was possessed an the logs was the same way they was
fairly wild leapin around in the maddest kind o water you ever see
The river was bilin high that spring it was an awful stubborn jam
an Pretty Quick hed ben workin on it sence dinner

He clumb up the bank moren once to have a pull at the bottle that was
hid in the bushes interpolated Mr Wiley Like as not that was his
failin Well most o the boys were on the other side o the river
workin above the bridge an the boss hed called Pretty Quick to come
off an leave the jam till mornin when theyd get horses an dogwarp
it off log by log But when the boss got out o sight Pretty Quick
jest stood right still swingin his axe an blasphemin so it would
freeze your blood vowin he would nt move till the logs did if he
stayed there till the crack o doom Jest then a great ponderous log
that hed ben churnin up an down in the falls for a week got free an
come blunderin an thunderin downriver Land it was chock full o
water an looked bout as big as a church It come straight along
buttend foremost an struck that jam full force so t every log in
it shivered There was a crackthe crack o doom sure enough for
Pretty Quickan one o the logs lep right out an struck him jest
where he stood with his axe in the air blasphemin The jam kind o
melted an crumbled up an in a second Pretty Quick was whirlin in the
white water He never rizat least where we could see himan we did
nt find him for a week Thats the whole story an I guess Steve takes
it as a warnin Anyway he aint no friend to rum nor swearin Steve
aint He knows Pretty Quicks ways shortened his mothers life an you
notice what a sharp lookout he keeps on Rufus

He needs it Ike Billings commented tersely

Some men seem to lose their wits when theyre workin on logs
observed Mr Wiley who had deeply resented Long Dennetts telling of a
story which he knew fully as well and could have told much better Now
natrally Ive seen things on the Kennebec

Three cheers for the Saco Hats off boys shouted Jed Towle and his
directions were followed with a will

As I was sayin continued the old man peacefully Ive seen things
on the Kennebec that would nt happen on a small river an Ive ben in
turrible places an taken turrible resks resks that would a turned a
Saco River mans hair white but them is the times when my wits work the
quickest I remember once I was smokin my pipe when a jam broke
under me T was a small jam or what we call a small jam on the
Kennebeconly about three hundred thousand pine logs The first thing
I knowed I was shootin back an forth in the bilin foam hangin on
t the end of a log like a spider My hands was clasped round the log
and I never lost control o my pipe They said I smoked right along
jest as cool an placid as a pondlily

Why d you quit drivin inquired Ivory

My strength want ekal to it Mr Wiley responded sadly I was all
skin bones an nerve The Compny would nt part with me altogether
so they give me a place in the office down on the wharves

That want so bad said Jed Towle why did nt you hang on to it
sos to keep in sight o the Kennebec

I found I could nt be confined under cover My liver give all out
my appetite failed me an I want wuth a days wages Id learned
engineerin when I was a boy an I thought Id try runnin on the road
a spell but it did nt suit my constitution My kidneys aint turrible
strong an the doctors said Id have Brights disease if I did nt git
some kind o work where there want no vibrations

Hard to find Mr Wiley hard to find said Jed Towle

Youre right responded the old man feelingly Ive tried all kinds
o labor Some of em dont suit my liver some disagrees with my
stomach and the rest of em has vibrations so here I set high an dry
on the banks of life you might say like a stranded log

As this wellknown simile fell upon the ear there was a general stir in
the group for Turrible Wiley when rhetorical sometimes grew tearful
and this was a mood not to be encouraged

All right boss called Ike Billings winking to the boys well be
there in a jiffy for the luncheon hour had flown and the work of the
afternoon was waiting for them You make a chalkmark where you left
off Mr Wiley an well hear the rest tomorrer only dont you forgit
nothin Remember t was the Kennebec you was talkin about

I will indeed responded the old man As I was sayin when
interrupted I may be a stranded log but Im proud that the mark o the
Gardner Lumber Compny is on me so t when I git to my journeys end
theyll know where I belong and send me back to the Kennebec Before
Im sawed up Id like to forgit this triflin brook in the sight of a
goodsized river an rest my eyes on some fullgrown logs stead o
these little damn pipestems you boys are playin with





V The Game of Jackstraws

There was a roar of laughter at the old mans boast but in a moment all
was activity The men ran hither and thither like ants gathering their
tools There were some oldfashioned pickpoles straight heavy levers
without any dog and there were modern pickpoles and peaveys for
every river has its favorite equipment in these things There was no
dynamite in those days to make the stubborn jams yield and the dogwarp
was in general use Horses or oxen sometimes a line of men stood on
the riverbank A long rope was attached by means of a steel spike
to one log after another and it was dragged from the tangled mass
Sometimes after unloading the top logs those at the bottom would rise
and make the task easier sometimes the work would go on for hours with
no perceptible progress and Mr Wiley would have opportunity to tell
the bystanders of a turrible jam on the Kennebec that had cost the
Lumber Company ten thousand dollars to break

There would be great arguments on shore among the villagers as well as
among the experts as to the particular log which might be a key to the
position The boss would study the problem from various standpoints
and the drivers themselves would pass from heated discussion into long
consultations

Theyre paid by the day Old Kennebec would philosophize to the
doctor an when theyre consultin they dont hev to be doggin which
is a turrible sight harder work

Rose had created a small sensation on one occasion by pointing out to
the under boss the keylog in a jam She was past mistress of the pretty
game of jackstraws much in vogue at that time The delicate little
lengths of polished wood or bone were shaken together and emptied on the
table Each jackstraw had one of its ends fashioned in the shape of some
sort of implementa rake hoe spade fork or mallet All the pieces
were intertwined by the shaking process and they lay as they fell in a
hopeless tangle The task consisted in taking a tiny pickpole scarcely
bigger than a match and with the bit of curved wire on the end lifting
off the jackstraws one by one without stirring the pile or making
it tremble When this occurred you gave place to your opponent who
relinquished his turn to you when ill fortune descended upon him the
game which was a kind of riverdriving and jampicking in miniature
being decided by the number of pieces captured and their value No
wonder that the under boss asked Roses advice as to the keylog She
had a fairys hand and her cunning at deciding the pieces to be moved
and her skill at extricating and lifting them from the heap were looked
upon in Edgewood as little less than supernatural It was a favorite
pastime and although a mans hand is ill adapted to it being
overlarge and heavy the game has obvious advantages for a lover in
bringing his head very close to that of his beloved adversary The
jackstraws have to be watched with a hawks eagerness since the
trembling can be discerned only by a keen eye but there were moments
when Stephen was willing to risk the loss of a battle if he could watch
Roses drooping eyelashes the delicate down on her pink cheek and the
feathery curls that broke away from her hair

He was looking at her now from a distance for she and Mite Shapley were
assisting Jed Towle to pile up the tin plates and tie the tin dippers
together Next she peered into one of the beanpots and seemed pleased
that there was still something in its depths then she gathered the
fragments neatly together in a basket and followed by her friend
clambered down the banks to a shady spot where the Boomshers otherwise
known as the Crambry family were lined up expectantly

It is not difficult to find a single fool in any community however
small but a family of fools is fortunately somewhat rarer Every
county however can boast of one foolfamily and York County is
always in the fashion with fools as with everything else The
unique muchquoted and undesirable Boomshers could not be claimed
as indigenous to the Saco valley for this branch was an offshoot of a
still larger tribe inhabiting a distant township Its beginnings were
shrouded in mystery There was a FrenchCanadian ancestor somewhere and
a Gypsy or Indian grandmother They had always intermarried from time
immemorial When one of the selectmen of their native place had been
asked why the Boomshers always married cousins and why the habit was
not discouraged he replied that he really did nt know he sposed they
felt it would be kind of odd to go right out and marry a stranger

Lest Boomsher seem an unusual surname it must be explained that
the actual name was French and could not be coped with by Edgewood or
Pleasant River being something as impossible to spell as to
pronounce As the family had lived for the last few years somewhere
near the Killick Cranberry Meadows they were calledand completely
described in the callingthe Crambry foolfamily A talented and much
traveled gentleman who once stayed over night at the Edgewood tavern
proclaimed it his opinion that Boomsher had been gradually corrupted
from Beaumarchais When he wrote the word on his visiting card and
showed it to Mr Wiley Old Kennebec had replied that in the judgment
of a man who had lived in large places and seen a turrible lot o life
such a name could never have been given either to a Christian or a
heathen family that the way in which the letters was thrown together
into it and the way in which they was sounded when read out loud was
entirely agin reason It was true he said that Beaumarchais bein
such a foolname might a ben invented apurpose for a foolfamily
but he would nt hold even with callin em Boomsher Crambry was well
enough for em an a sight easier to speak

Stephen knew a good deal about the Crambrys for he passed their
socalled habitation in going to one of his woodlots It was only
a month before that he had found them all sitting outside their
brokendown fence surrounded by decrepit chairs sofas tables
bedsteads bits of carpet and stoves

Whats the matter he called out from his wagon

There aint nothin the matter said Alcestis Crambry Fathers
dead an were dividin up the furnerchure

Alcestis was the pride of the Crambrys and the list of his attainments
used often to be on his proud fathers lips It was he who was the
largest for his size in the family he who could tell his brothers
Paul and Arcadus by their looks he who knew a sour apple from a sweet
one the minute he bit it he who at the early age of ten was bright
enough to point to the cupboard and say Puddin dad

Alcestis had enjoyed in consequence of his unusual intellectual powers
some educational privileges and the Killick schoolmistress well
remembered his first day at the village seat of learning Reports of
what took place in this classic temple from day to day may have been
wafted to the dull ears of the boy who was not thought ready for school
until he had attained the ripe age of twelve It may even have been
that specific rumors of the signs symbols and hieroglyphics used
in educational institutions had reached him in the obscurity of his
cranberry meadows At all events when confronted by the alphabet chart
whose huge black capitals were intended to capture the wandering eyes
of the infant class Alcestis exhibited unusual almost unnatural
excitement That is A my boy said the teacher genially as she
pointed to the first character on the chart Good God is that A
cried Alcestis sitting down heavily on the nearest bench And neither
teacher nor scholars could discover whether he was agreeably surprised
or disappointed in the letterwhether he had expected if he ever
encountered it to find it writhing in coils on the floor of a cage or
whether it simply bore no resemblance to the ideal already established
in his mind

Mrs Wiley had once tried to make something of Mercy the oldest
daughter of the family but at the end of six weeks she announced that
a girl who could nt tell whether the clock was going forrards or
backwards and who rubbed a pockethandkerchief as long as she did a
sheet would be no help in her household

The Crambrys had daily walked the five or six miles from their home to
the Edgewood bridge during the progress of the drive not only for
the social and intellectual advantages to be gained from the company
present but for the more solid compensation of a good meal They all
adored Rose partly because she gave them food and partly because she
was sparkling and pretty and wore pink dresses that caught their dull
eyes


The afternoon proved a lively one In the first place one of the
younger men slipped into the water between two logs part of a lot
chained together waiting to be let out of the boom The weight of
the mass higher up and the force of the current wedged him in rather
tightly and when he had been pried out he declared that he felt like
an apple after it had been squeezed in the cidermill so he drove home
and Rufus Waterman took his place

Two hours hard work followed this incident and at the end of that time
the bung that reached from the shore to Watermans Ledge the rock
where Pretty Quick met his fate was broken up and the logs that
composed it were started downriver There remained now only the great
side jam at Gray Rock This had been allowed to grow gathering logs as
they drifted past thus making higher water and a stronger current on
the other side of the rock and allowing an easier passage for the logs
at that point

All was excitement now for this particular piece of work accomplished
the boom above the falls would be turned out and the river would once
more be clear and clean at the Edgewood bridge

Small boys perching on the rocks with their heels hanging hands and
mouths full of red Astrakhan apples cheered their favorites to the
echo while the drivers shouted to one another and watched the signs and
signals of the boss who could communicate with them only in that way
so great was the roar of the water

The jam refused to yield to ordinary measures It was a difficult
problem for the rocky riverbed held many a snare and pitfall There
was a certain ledge under the water so artfully placed that every log
striking under its projecting edges would wedge itself firmly there
attracting others by its evil example

That galootboss ought to hev shoved his crew down to that jam this
mornin grumbled Old Kennebec to Alcestis Crambry who was always his
most loyal and attentive listener But he would nt take no advice not
if Pharaoh nor Boaz nor Herod nor Nicodemus come right out o the Bible
an give it to him The logs air contrary today Sometimes theyll go
along as easy as an old shoe an other times theyll do nothin but
bung bung bung Theres a log nestlin down in the middle o that jam
that Ive ben watchin for a week Its a curous one to begin with
an then it has a mark on it that you can reconize it by Did ye ever
hear tell o George the Third King of England Alcestis or aint he
known over to the crambry medders Well once upon a time men used to
go through the forests over here an slash a mark on the trunks o the
biggest trees That was the royal sign as you might say an meant that
the tree was to be taken over to England to make masts an yardarms for
the Kings ships What made me think of it now is that the Kings mark
was an arrer an its an arrer thats on that there log Im showin
ye Well sir I seen it fust at Millikens Mills a Monday It was in
trouble then an its ben in trouble ever sence Thats allers the
way therell be one pesky crooked contrary consarned log that cant
go anywheres without gittin into difficulties You can yank it out an
set it afloat an before you hardly git your doggin iron off of it
itll be snarled up agin in some new place From the time its chopped
down to the day it gets to Saco it costs the Compny bout ten times
its pesky valler as lumber Now theyve sent over to Bensons for a team
of horses an I bate ye they cant git em I wish i was the boss on
this river Alcestis

I wish I was echoed the boy

Well your headfillin aint the right kind for a boss Alcestis an
youd better stick to dry land You set right down here while I go back
a piece an git the pipe out o my coat pocket I guess nothin aint
goin to happen for a few minutes

The surmise about the horses unlike most of Old Kennebecs proved
to be true Bensons pair had gone to Portland with a load of hay
accordingly the tackle was brought the rope was adjusted to a log and
five of the drivers standing on the riverbank attempted to drag it
from its intrenched position It refused to yield the fraction of an
inch Rufus and Stephen joined the five men and the augmented crew of
seven were putting all their strength on the rope when a cry went up
from the watchers on the bridge The dog had loosened suddenly and
the men were flung violently to the ground For a second they were
stunned both by the surprise and by the shock of the blow but in the
same moment the cry of the crowd swelled louder Alcestis Crambry had
stolen all unnoticed to the rope and had attempted to use his feeble
powers for the common good When the blow came he fell backward and
making no effort to control the situation slid over the bank and into
the water

The other Crambrys not realizing the danger laughed audibly but there
was no jeering from the bridge

Stephen had seen Alcestis slip and in the fraction of a moment had
taken off his boots and was coasting down the slippery rocks behind him
in a twinkling he was in the water almost as soon as the boy himself

Doggoned idjut exclaimed Old Kennebec tearfully Wuth the hull
foolfamily If I hed nt a ben so old Id a jumped in myself for
you cant drownd a Wiley not without you tie nailkags to their head
an feet an drop em in the falls

Alcestis who had neither brains courage nor experience had better
still the luck that follows the witless He was carried swiftly down
the current but only fifty feet away a long slender log wedged
between two low rocks on the shore jutted out over the water almost
touching its surface The boys clothes were admirably adapted to the
situation being full of enormous rents In some way the end of the log
caught in the rags of Alcestiss coat and held him just seconds enough
to enable Stephen to swim to him to seize him by the nape of the neck
to lift him on the log and thence to the shore It was a particularly
bad place for a landing and there was nothing to do but to lower ropes
and drag the drenched men to the high ground above

Alcestis came to his senses in ten or fifteen minutes and seemed as
bright as usual with a kind of added swagger at being the central
figure in a dramatic situation

I wonder you hed nt stove your brains out when you landed so turrible
suddent on that rock at the foot of the bank said Mr Wiley to him

I should but I took good care to light on my head responded
Alcestis a cryptic remark which so puzzled Old Kennebec that he mused
over it for some hours





VI Hearts And Other Hearts

Stephen had brought a change of clothes as he had a habit of being
ducked once at least during the day and since there was a halt in the
proceedings and no need of his services for an hour or two he found
Rose and walked with her to a secluded spot where they could watch the
logs and not be seen by the people

You frightened everybody almost to death jumping into the river
chided Rose

Stephen laughed They thought I was a fool to save a fool I suppose

Perhaps not as bad as that but it did seem reckless

I know and the boy no doubt would be better off dead but so should
I be if I could have let him die

Rose regarded this strange point of view for a moment and then silently
acquiesced in it She was constantly doing this and she often felt that
her mental horizon broadened in the act but she could not be sure that
Stephen grew any dearer to her because of his moral altitudes

Besides Stephen argued I happened to be nearest to the river and
it was my job

How do you always happen to be nearest to the people in trouble and
why is it always your job

If there are any rewards for good conduct being distributed Im right
in line with my hand stretched out Stephen replied with meaning in
his voice

Rose blushed under her flowery hat as he led the way to a bench under a
sycamore tree that overhung the water

She had almost convinced herself that she was as much in love with
Stephen Waterman as it was in her nature to be with anybody He was
handsome in his big way kind generous temperate well educated and
welltodo No fault could be found with his family for his mother had
been a teacher and his father though a farmer a college graduate
Stephen himself had had one year at Bowdoin but had been recalled as
the head of the house when his father died That was a severe blow
but his mothers death three years after was a grief never to be quite
forgotten Rose too was the child of a gently bred mother and all her
instincts were refined Yes Stephen in himself satisfied her in all the
larger wants of her nature but she had an unsatisfied hunger for the
worldthe world of Portland where her cousins lived or better
still the world of Boston of which she heard through Mrs Wealthy
Brooks whose nephew Claude often came to visit her in Edgewood Life
on a farm a mile and a half distant from postoffice and stores life
in the house with Rufus who was rumored to be somewhat wild and
unsteadythis prospect seemed a trifle dull and uneventful to the
trivial part of her though to the better part it was enough The better
part of her loved Stephen Waterman dimly feeling the richness of his
nature the tenderness of his affection the strength of his character
Rose was not destitute either of imagination or sentiment She did not
relish this constant weighing of Stephen in the balance he was too good
to be weighed and considered She longed to be carried out of herself on
a wave of rapturous assent but something seemed to hold her backsome
seed of discontent with the mans environment and circumstances some
germ of longing for a gayer brighter more varied life No amount of
selfsearching or argument could change the situation She always loved
Stephen more or less more when he was away from her because she never
approved his collars nor the set of his shirt bosom and as he naturally
wore these despised articles of apparel whenever he proposed to her she
was always lukewarm about marrying him and settling down on the River
Farm Still today she discovered in herself with positive gratitude
a warmer feeling for him than she had experienced before He wore a new
and becoming gray flannel shirt with the soft turnover collar that
belonged to it and a blue tie the color of his kind eyes She knew
that he had shaved his beard at her request not long ago and that when
she did not like the effect as much as she had hoped he had meekly
grown a mustache for her sake it did seem as if a man could hardly do
more to please an exacting ladylove

And she had admired him unreservedly when he pulled off his boots and
jumped into the river to save Alcestis Crambrys life without giving a
single thought to his own

And was there ever after all such a noble devoted unselfish fellow
or a better brother And would she not despise herself for rejecting
him simply because he was countrified and because she longed to see the
world of the fashion plates in the magazines

The logs are so like people she exclaimed as they sat down I could
name nearly every one of them for somebody in the village Look at Mite
Shapley that dancing little one slipping over the falls and skimming
along the top of the water keeping out of all the deep places and
never once touching the rocks

Stephen fell into her mood Theres Squire Anderson coming down
crosswise and bumping everything in reach You know hes always buying
lumber and logs without knowing what he is going to do with them They
just lie and rot by the roadside The boys always say that a toadstool
is the old Squires mark on a log

And that stout clumsy one is Short DennettWhat are you doing
Stephen

Only building a fence round this clump of harebells Stephen replied
Theyve just got well rooted and if the boys come skidding down the
bank with their spiked shoes the poor things will never hold up their
heads again Now theyre safeOh look Rose There come the minister
and his wife

A portly couple of peeled logs exactly matched in size came
ponderously over the falls together rose within a second of each other
joined again and swept under the bridge side by side

Andoh ohDr and Mrs Cram just after them Isnt that funny
laughed Rose as a very long slender pair of pines swam down as close
to each other as if they had been glued in that position Rose thought
as she watched them who but Stephen would have cared what became of the
clump of delicate harebells How gentle such a man would be to a woman
How tender his touch would be if she were ill or in trouble

Several single logs followedcrooked ones stolid ones adventurous
ones feeble swimmers deep divers Some of them tried to start a small
jam on their own account others stranded themselves for good and all
as Rose and Stephen sat there side by side with little Dan Cupid for an
invisible third on the bench

There never was anything so like people Rose repeated leaning
forward excitedly And upon my word the minister and doctor couples
are still together I wonder if theyll get as far as the fails at
Union That would be an odd place to part would nt itUnion

Stephen saw his opportunity and seized it

Theres a reason Rose why two logs go downstream better than one and
get into less trouble They make a wider path create more force and a
better current Its the same way with men and women Oh Rose there
is nt a man in the world thats loved you as long or knows how to love
you any better than I do Youre just like a white birch sapling and
Im a great clumsy fir tree but if you ll only trust yourself to me
Rose Ill take you safely downriver

Stephens big hand closed on Roses little one she returned its
pressure softly and gave him the kiss that with her as with him meant
a promise for all the years to come The truth and passion in the man
had broken the girls bonds for the moment Her vision was clearer and
realizing the treasures of love and fidelity that were being offered
her she accepted them half unconscious that she was not returning
them in kind How is the belle of two villages to learn that she should
thank Heaven fasting for a good mans love

And Stephen He went home in the dusk not knowing whether his feet were
touching the solid earth or whether he was treading upon rainbows

Roses pink calico seemed to brush him as he walked in the path that was
wide enough only for one His solitude was peopled again when he fed
the cattle for Roses face smiled at him from the haymow and when he
strained the milk Rose held the pans

His nightly tasks over he went out and took his favorite seat under the
apple tree All was still save for the crickets ceaseless chirp
the soft thud of an August sweeting dropping in the grass and the
swishswash of the water against his boat tethered in the Willow Cove

He remembered when he first saw Rose for that must have been when he
began to love her though he was only fourteen and quite unconscious
that the first seed had been dropped in the rich soil of his boyish
heart

He was seated on the kerosene barrel in the Edgewood postoffice which
was also the general country store where newspapers letters molasses
nails salt codfish hairpins sugar liver pills canned goods beans
and ginghams dwelt in genial proximity When she entered just a
little pinkandwhite slip of a thing with a tin pail in her hand and a
sunbonnet falling off her wavy hair Stephen suddenly stopped swinging
his feet She gravely announced her wants reading them from a bit of
paper1 quart molasses 1 package ginger 1 lb cheese 2 pairs shoe
laces 1 card shirt buttons

While the storekeeper drew off the molasses she exchanged shy looks with
Stephen who clean welldressed and carefully mothered as he was
felt all at once uncouth and awkward rather as if he were some clumsy
lout pitchforked into the presence of a fairy queen He offered her the
little bunch of bachelors buttons he held in his hand augury of
the future had he known itand she accepted them with a smile She
dropped her memorandum he picked it up and she smiled again doing
still more fatal damage than in the first instance No words were
spoken but Rose even at ten had less need of them than most of her
sex for her dimples aided by dancing eyes length of lashes and curve
of lips quite took the place of conversation The dimples tempted
assented denied corroborated deplored protested sympathized while
the intoxicated beholder cudgeled his brain for words or deeds which
should provoke and evoke more and more dimples

The storekeeper hung the molasses pail over Roses right arm and tucked
the packages under her left and as he opened the mosquitonetting door
to let her pass out she looked back at Stephen perched on the kerosene
barrel just a little girl a little glance a little dimple and
Stephen was never quite the same again The years went on and the boy
became man yet no other image had ever troubled the deep placid waters
of his heart Now after many denials the hopes and longings of his
nature had been answered and Rose had promised to marry him He would
sacrifice his passion for logging and driving in the future and become
a staid farmer and man of affairs only giving himself a river holiday
now and then How still and peaceful it was under the trees and how
glad his mother would be to think that the old farm would wake from its
sleep and a womans light foot be heard in the sunny kitchen

Heaven was full of silent stars and there was a moonglade on the water
that stretched almost from him to Rose His heart embarked on that
golden pathway and sailed on it to the farther shore The river was free
of logs and under the light of the moon it shone like a silver mirror
The soft wind among the fir branches breathed Roses name the river
rippling against the shore sang Rose  and as Stephen sat there
dreaming of the future his dreams too could have been voiced in one
word and that word Rose




VII The Little House


The autumn days flew past like shuttles in a loom The river reflected
the yellow foliage of the white birch and the scarlet of the maples The
wayside was bright with goldenrod with the red tassels of the sumac
with the purple frostflower and feathery clematis

If Rose was not as happy as Stephen she was quietly content and
felt that she had more to be grateful for than most girls for Stephen
surprised her with first one evidence and then another of thoughtful
generosity In his heart of hearts he felt that Rose was not wholly his
that she reserved withheld something and it was the subjugation of
this rebellious province that he sought He and Rose had agreed to wait
a year for their marriage in which time Roses cousin would finish
school and be ready to live with the old people meanwhile Stephen had
learned that his maiden aunt would be glad to come and keep house for
Rufus The work at the River Farm was too hard for a girl so he had
persuaded himself of late and the house was so far from the village
that Rose was sure to be lonely He owned a couple of acres between
his place and the Edgewood bridge and here one afternoon only a month
after their engagement he took Rose to see the foundations of a little
house he was building for her It was to be only a storyandahalf
cottage of six small rooms the two upper chambers to be finished off
later on Stephen had placed it well back from the road leaving space
in front for what was to be a most wonderful arrangement of flowerbeds
yet keeping a strip at the back on the riverbrink for a small
vegetable garden There had been a house there years beforeso many
years that the blackened ruins were entirely overgrown but a few elms
and an old appleorchard remained to shade the new dwelling and give
welcome to the coming inmates

Stephen had fifteen hundred dollars in bank he could turn his hand to
almost anything and his love was so deep that Roses plumbline had
never sounded bottom accordingly he was able with the help of two
steady workers to have the roof on before the first of November The
weather was clear and fine and by Thanksgiving clapboards shingles
two coats of brown paint and even the blinds had all been added This
exhibition of reckless energy on Stephens part did not wholly commend
itself to the neighborhood

Steves too turrible spry said Roses grandfather hell trip
himself up some o these times

_You_ never will remarked his better half sagely

The resks in life come along fast enough without runnin to meet em
continued the old man Theres good dough in Rose but it aint moren
half riz Let somebody come along an drop in a little more yeast or
set the dish a little mite nearer the stove an youll see what ll
happen

Steves kept house for himself some time an I guess he knows more
about breadmakin than you do

There dont nobody know moren I do about nothin when my pipes
drawin real good an nobodys thornin me to go to work replied Mr
Wiley but nobodys willin to take the advice of a man thats seen
the world an lived in large places an the risin generation is in a
turrible hurry I don know how t is young folks air allers settin
the clock forrard an the old ones puttin it back

Did you ketch anything for dinner when you was out this mornin asked
his wife

No I fished an fished till I was about ready to drop an I did git
a few shiners but land they want as big as the worms I was ketchin
em with so i pitched em back in the water an quit

During the progress of these remarks Mr Wiley opened the door under the
sink and from beneath a huge iron pot drew a round tray loaded with a
glass pitcher and half a dozen tumblers which he placed carefully
on the kitchen table This is the last days option Ive got on this
lemonadeset he said an if Im goin to Biddeford tomorrer Ive got
to make up my mind here an now

With this observation he took off his shoes climbed in his stocking
feet to the vantage ground of a kitchen chair and lifted a stone china
pitcher from a corner of the highest cupboard shelf where it had been
hidden This lemonades gittin kind o dusty he complained I
callated to hev a kind of a spree on it when I got through choosin
Roses weddin present but I guess the pig ll hev to help me out
The old man filled one of the glasses from the pitcher pulled up the
kitchen shades to the top put both hands in his pockets and walked
solemnly round the table gazing at his offering from every possible
point of view There had been three lemonadesets in the window of a
Biddeford crockery store when Mr Wiley chanced to pass by and he had
brought home the blue and green one on approval To th casual cyc it
would have appeared as quite uniquely hideous until the red and yellow
or the purple and orange ones had been seen after that no human
being could have made a decision where each was so unparalleled in its
ugliness and Old Kennebecs confusion of mind would have been perfectly
understood by the connoisseur

How do you like it with the lemonade in mother he inquired eagerly
The thing that plagues me most is that the red an yaller one I hed
home last week lights up bettern this an I believe Ill settle on
that for as I was thinkin last night in bed lemonade is mostly an
evenin drink an Rose wont be usin the set much by daylight Root
beer looks the hansomest in this purple set but Rose loves lemonade
bettern beer so I guess Ill pack up this one an change it tomorrer
Mebbe when I get it out o sight an give the lemonade to the pig Ill
be easier in my mind

In the opinion of the community at large Stephens forehandedness in the
matter of preparations for his marriage was imprudence and his desire
for neatness and beauty flagrant extravagance The house itself was a
foolish idea it was thought but there were extenuating circumstances
for the maiden aunt really needed a home and Rufus was likely to marry
before long and take his wife to the River Farm It was to be hoped
in his case that he would avoid the snares of beauty and choose a
good stout girl who would bring the dairy back to what it was in Mrs
Watermans time

All winter long Stephen labored on the inside of the cottage mostly
by himself He learned all trades in succession Love being his only
master He had many odd days to spare from his farm work and if he had
not found days he would have taken nights Scarcely a nail was driven
without Roses advice and when the plastering was hard and dry the
wallpapers were the result of weeks of consultation

Among the quiet joys of life there is probably no other so deep so
sweet so full of trembling hope and delight as the building and making
of a homea home where two lives are to be merged in one and flow on
together a home full of mysterious and delicious possibilities hidden
in a future which is always rosecolored

Roses sweet little nature broadened under Stephens influence but she
had her moments of discontent and unrest always followed quickly by
remorse

At the Thanksgiving sociable some one had observed her turquoise
engagement ringsome one who said that such a hand was worthy of a
diamond that turquoises were a pretty color but that there was
only one stone for an engagement ring and that was a diamond At the
Christmas dance the same some one had said that her waltzing would make
her all the rage in Boston She wondered if it were true and wondered
whether if she had not promised to marry Stephen some splendid being
from a city would have descended from his heights bearing diamonds
in his hand Not that she would have accepted them she only wondered
These disloyal thoughts came seldom and she put them resolutely away
devoting herself with all the greater assiduity to her muslin curtains
and ruffled pillowshams Stephen too had his momentary pangs There
were times when he could calm his doubts only by working on the little
house The mere sight of the beloved floors and walls and ceilings
comforted his heart and brought him good cheer

The winter was a cold one so bitterly cold that even the rapid water at
the Gray Rock was a mass of curdled yellow ice something that had
only occurred once or twice before within the memory of the oldest
inhabitant

It was also a very gay season for Pleasant River and Edgewood Never had
there been so many cardparties sleighrides and tavern dances and
never such wonderful skating The river was one gleaming glittering
thoroughfare of ice from Millikens Mills to the dam at the Edgewood
bridge At sundown bonfires were built here and there on the mirrorlike
surface and all the young people from the neighboring villages gathered
on the ice while detachments of merry rosycheeked boys and girls
those who preferred coasting met at the top of Brigadier Hill from
which one could get a longer and more perilous slide than from any other
point in the township

Claude Merrill in his occasional visits from Boston was very much in
evidence at the Saturday evening ice parties He was not an artist
at the sport himself but he was especially proficient in the art of
strapping on a ladys skates and murmuringas he adjusted the last
buckleThe prettiest foot and ankle on the river It cannot be
denied that this compliment gave secret pleasure to the fair village
maidens who received it but it was a pleasure accompanied by electric
shocks of excitement A girls foot might perhaps be mentioned if a
fellow were daring enough but the line was rigidly drawn at the ankle
which was not a part of the human frame ever alluded to in the polite
society of Edgewood at that time

Rose in her red linseywoolsey dress and her squirrel furs and cap
was the life of every gathering and when Stephen took her hand and they
glided upstream alone together in the crowd he used to wish that they
might skate on and on up the crystal icepath of the river to the moon
itself whither it seemed to lead them




VIII The Garden of Eden

But the Saco all this time was meditating one of its surprises The
snapping cold weather and the depth to which the water was frozen were
aiding it in its preparation for the greatest event of the season On
a certain gray Saturday in March after a week of mild temperature it
began to rain as if after months of snowing it really enjoyed a new
form of entertainment Sunday dawned with the very floodgates of heaven
opening so it seemed All day long the river was rising under its miles
of unbroken ice rising at the threatening rate of four inches an hour

Edgewood went to bed as usual that night for the bridge at that point
was set too high to be carried away by freshets but at other villages
whose bridges were in less secure position there was little sleep and
much anxiety

At midnight a cry was heard from the men watching at Millikens Mills
The great ice jam had parted from Rolfes Island and was swinging out
into the open pushing everything before it All the ablebodied men in
the village turned out of bed and with lanterns in hand began to clear
the stores and mills for it seemed that everything near the riverbanks
must go before that avalanche of ice

Stephen and Rufus were there helping to save the property of their
friends and neighbors Rose and Mite Shapley had stayed the night with
a friend and all three girls were shivering with fear and excitement as
they stood near the bridge watching the nevertobeforgotten sight
It is needless to say that the Crambry family was on hand for whatever
instincts they may have lacked the instinct for being on the spot
when anything was happening was present in them to the most remarkable
extent The town was supporting them in modest winter quarters somewhat
nearer than Killick to the center of civilization and the first alarm
brought them promptly to the scene Mrs Crambry remarking at intervals
If Id known thered be so many out Id ought to have worn my bunnit
but I aint got no bunnit an if I had they say I aint got no head to
wear it on

By the time the jam neared the falls it had grown with its
accumulations until it was made up of tier after tier of huge ice
cakes piled side by side and one upon another with heaps of trees and
branches and drifting lumber holding them in place Some of the blocks
stood erect and towered like icebergs and these glittering in the
lights of the twinkling lanterns pushed solemnly forward cracking
crushing and cutting everything in their way When the great mass
neared the planing mill on the east shore the girls covered their eyes
expecting to hear the crash of the falling building but impelled by
the force of some mysterious current it shook itself ponderously
and then with one magnificent movement slid up the riverbank tier
following tier in grand confusion This left a water way for the main
drift the ice broke in every direction and down down down from
Bonnie Eagle and Moderation swept the harvest of the winter freezing It
came thundering over the dam bringing boats farming implements posts
supports and every sort of floating lumber with it and cutting under
the flour mill tipped it cleverly over on its side and went crashing on
its way downriver At Edgewood it pushed colossal blocks of ice up the
banks into the roadway piling them end upon end ten feet in air Then
tearing and rumbling and booming through the narrows it covered the
intervale at Pleasant Point and made a huge ice bridge below Union
Falls a bridge so solid that it stood there for days a sight for all
the neighboring villages

This exciting event would have forever set apart this winter from all
others in Stephens memory even had it not been also the winter when
he was building a house for his future wife But afterwards in looking
back on the wild night of the ice freshet Stephen remembered that
Roses manner was strained and cold and evasive and that when he had
seen her talking with Claude Merrill it had seemed to him that that
whippersnapper had looked at her as no honorable man in Edgewood ever
looked at an engaged girl He recalled his throb of gratitude that
Claude lived at a safe distance and his subsequent pang of remorse at
doubting for an instant Roses fidelity

So at length April came the Saco was still high turbid and angry
and the boys were waiting at Limington Falls for the Ossipee drive
to begin Stephen joined them there for he was restless and the
river called him as it did every spring Each stubborn log that he
encountered gave him new courage and power of overcoming The rush of
the water the noise and roar and dash the exposure and danger all
made the blood run in his veins like new wine When he came back to
the farm all the cobwebs had been blown from his brain and his first
interview with Rose was so intoxicating that he went immediately to
Portland and bought in a kind of secret penitence for his former
fears a pale pinkflowered wallpaper for the bedroom in the new home
It had once been voted down by the entire advisory committee Mrs Wiley
said that pink was foolish and was always sure to fade and the
border being a mass of solid roses was five cents a yard virtually
a prohibitive price Mr Wiley said he should hate to hev a spell of
sickness an lay abed in a room where there was things growin all over
the place He thought roughplastered walls where you could lay an
count the spots where the roof leaked was the most entertainin
in sickness Rose had longed for the lovely pattern but had sided
dutifully with the prudent majority so that it was with a feeling
of unauthorized and illegitimate joy that Stephen papered the room at
night a few strips at a time

On the third evening when he had removed all signs of his work he
lighted two kerosene lamps and two candles finding the effect under
this illumination almost too brilliant and beautiful for belief Rose
should never see it now he determined until the furniture was in
place They had already chosen the kitchen and bedroom things though
they would not be needed for some months but the rest was to wait until
summer when there would be the haymoney to spend

Stephen did not go back to the River Farm till one oclock that night
the pink bedroom held him in fetters too powerful to break It looked
like the garden of Eden he thought To be sure it was only fifteen
feet square Eden might have been a little larger possibly but
otherwise the pink bedroom had every advantage The pattern of roses
growing on a trellis was brighter than any flowerbed in June and the
borderwell if the border had been five dollars a foot Stephen would
not have grudged the money when he saw the twenty running yards of rosy
bloom rioting under the white ceiling

Before he blew out the last light he raised it high above his head and
took one fond final look Its the only place I ever saw he thought
that is pretty enough for her She will look just as if she was growing
here with all the other flowers and I shall always think of it as the
garden of Eden I wonder if I got the license and the ring and took her
by surprise whether shed be married in June instead of August I could
be all ready if I could only persuade her

At this moment Stephen touched the summit of happiness and it is a
curious coincidence that as he was dreaming in his garden of Eden the
serpent having just arrived at Edgewood was sleeping peacefully at the
house of Mrs Brooks

It was the serpents fourth visit that season and he explained to
inquiring friends that his former employer had sold the business and
that the new management while reorganizing had determined to enlarge
the premises the three clerks who had been retained having two weeks
vacation with half pay

It is extraordinary how frequently wise serpents are retained by the
management on half or even full salary while the services of the
harmless doves are dispensed with and they are set free to flutter
where they will




IX The Serpent


Rose Wiley had the brightest eyes in Edgewood It was impossible to
look at her without realizing that her physical sight was perfect What
mysterious species of blindness is it that descends now and then
upon human creatures and renders them incapable of judgment or
discrimination

Claude Merrill was a glove salesman in a Boston fancygoods store The
calling itself is undoubtedly respectable and it is quite conceivable
that a man can sell gloves and still be a man but Claude Merrill was a
manikin He inhabited a very narrow space behind a very short counter
but to him it seemed the earth and the fullness thereof

When irreproachably neat and even exquisite in dress he gave a
Napoleonic glance at his array of gloveboxes to see if the female
assistant had put them in proper order for the day when with that
wonderful eye for detail that had wafted him to his present height
of power he pounced upon the powdersprinklers and found them as
he expected empty when with masterly judgment he had made up and
ticketed a basket of misfits and odd sizes to attract the eyes of women
who were their human counterparts he felt himself bursting with the
pride and pomp of circumstance His cambric handkerchief adjusted in
his coat with the monogram corner well displayed a last touch to
the carefully trained lock on his forehead and he was ready for his
customers

Six did you say miss I should have thought five and three
quartersAttend to that gentleman Miss Dix please I am very busy

Sixandahalf gray suede Here they are an exquisite shade Shall
I try them on The right hand if you will Perhaps youd better remove
your elegant ring I should nt like to have anything catch in the
setting

Miss Dix Sixandahalf black glaceupper shelf third boxfor
this lady Shes in a hurry We shall see you often after this I hope
madam

No we dont keep silk or lisle gloves We have no call for them our
customers prefer kid

Oh but he was in his element was Claude Merrill though the glamour
that surrounded him in the minds of the Edgewood girls did not emanate
wholly from his finicky little person something of it was the glamour
that belonged to Bostonremote fashionable gay rich almost
inaccessible Boston which none could see without the expenditure of
five or six dollars in railway fare with the added extravagance of
a night in a hotel if one would explore it thoroughly and come home
possessed of all its illimitable treasures of wisdom and experience

When Claude came to Edgewood for a Sunday or to spend a vacation with
his aunt he brought with him something of the magic of a metropolis
Suddenly to Roses eye Stephen looked larger and clumsier his shoes
were not the proper sort his clothes were ordinary his neckties were
years behind the fashion Stephens dancing compared with Claudes was
as the deliberate motion of an ox to the hopping of a neat little robin
When Claude took a girls hand in the grand rightandleft it was
as if he were about to try on a delicate glove the manner in which he
held his lady in the polka or schottische made her seem a queen Mite
Shapley was so affected by it that when Rufus attempted to encircle her
for the mazurka she exclaimed Dont act as if you were spearing logs
Rufus

Of the two men Stephen had more to say but Claude said more He was
thought brilliant in conversation but what wonder when one considered
his advantages and his dazzling experiences He had customers who were
worth their thousands ladies whose fingers never touched dishwater
ladies who would nt buy a glove of anybody else if they went
barehanded to the grave He lived with his sister Maude Arthurlena in a
house where there were twentytwo other boarders who could be seated at
meals all at the same time so immense was the diningroom He ate his
dinner at a restaurant daily and expended twentyfive cents for it
without blenching He went to the theater once a week and was often
accompanied by lady friends who were elegant dressers

In a moment of wrath Stephen had called him a counterjumper but it
was a libel So short and rough a means of exit from his place of power
was wholly beneath Claudes dignity It was with a Pardon me Miss
Dix that the noon hour having arrived he squeezed by that slave and
victim and raising the hinged board that separated his kingdom from
that of the ribbon department passed out of the store hat in hand
serene in the consciousness that though other clerks might nibble
luncheon from a brown paper bag he would speedily be indulging in an
expensive repast and Miss Dix knew it and it was a part of his almost
invincible attraction for her

It seemed flying in the face of Providence to decline the attentions of
such a gorgeous butterfly of fashion simply because one was engaged to
marry another man at some distant day

All Edgewood femininity united in saying that there never was such
a perfect gentleman as Claude Merrill and during the time when his
popularity was at its height Rose lost sight of the fact that Stephen
could have furnished the stuff for a dozen Claudes and have had enough
left for an ordinary man besides

April gave place to May and a veil hung between the loversan
intangible gossamerlike thing not to be seen with the naked eye but
oh so plainly to be felt Rose hid herself thankfully behind it
while Stephen had not courage to lift a corner She had twice been seen
driving with Claude Merrillthat Stephen knew but she had explained
that there were errands to be done that her grandfather had taken
the horse and that Mr Merrills escort had been both opportune and
convenient for these practical reasons Claude was everywhere present
the center of attraction the observed of all observers He was
irresistible contagious almost epidemic Rose was now gay now silent
now affectionate now distant now coquettish in fine everything that
was capricious mysterious agitating incomprehensible

One morning Alcestis Crambry went to the postoffice for Stephen and
brought him back the newspapers and letters He had hung about the River
Farm so much that Stephen finally gave him bed and food in exchange for
numberless small errands Rufus was temporarily confined in a dark room
with some strange pain and trouble in his eyes and Alcestis proved of
use in many ways He had always been Roses slave and had often brought
messages and notes from the Brier Neighborhood so that when Stephen saw
a folded note among the papers his heart gave a throb of anticipation

The note was brief and when he had glanced through it he said This is
not mine Alcestis it belongs to Miss Rose Go straight back and give
it to her as you were told and another time keep your wits about you
or Ill send you back to Killick

Alcestis Crambrys ideas on all subjects were extremely vague Claude
Merrill had given him a letter for Rose but his notion was that
anything that belonged to her belonged to Stephen and the Waterman
place was much nearer than the Wileys particularly at dinnertime

When the boy had slouched away Stephen sat under the apple tree now a
mass of roseate bloom and buried his face in his hands

It was not precisely a loveletter that he had read nevertheless it
blackened the light of the sun for him Claude asked Rose to meet him
anywhere on the road to the station and to take a little walk as he was
leaving that afternoon and could not bear to say goodbye to her in
the presence of her grandmother _Under the circumstances_ he wrote
deeply underlining the words I cannot remain a moment longer in
Edgewood where I have been so happy and so miserable He did not refer
to the fact that the time limit on his returnticket expired that day
for his dramatic instinct told him that such sordid matters have no
place in heroics

Stephen sat motionless under the tree for an hour deciding on some plan
of action He had work at the little house but he did not dare go there
lest he should see the face of dead Love looking from the windows of the
pink bedroom dead Love cold sad merciless His cheeks burned as he
thought of the marriage license and the gold ring hidden away upstairs
in the drawer of his shaving stand What a romantic fool he had been to
think he could hasten the glad day by a single moment What a piece of
boyish folly it had been and how it shamed him in his own eyes

When train time drew near he took his boat and paddled downstream
If for the Finland lovers reindeer there was but one path in all the
world and that the one that led to Her so it was for Stephens canoe
which had it been set free on the river by day or by night might have
floated straight to Rose

He landed at the usual place a bit of sandy shore near the Wiley house
and walked drearily up the bank through the woods Under the shade
of the pines the white stars of the hepatica glistened and the pale
anemones were coming into bloom Partridgeberries glowed red under
their glossy leaves and clumps of violets sweetened the air Squirrels
chattered woodpeckers tapped thrushes sang but Stephen was blind and
deaf to all the sweet harbingers of spring

Just then he heard voices realizing with a throb of delight that at
any rate Rose had not left home to meet Claude as he had asked her to
do Looking through the branches he saw the two standing together Mrs
Brookss horse with the offensive trunk in the back of the wagon being
hitched to a tree near by There was nothing in the tableau to stir
Stephen to fury but he read between the lines and suffered as he
readsuffered and determined to sacrifice himself if he must so that
Rose could have what she wanted this miserable apology for a man He
had never been the husband for Rose she must take her place in a larger
community worthy of her beauty and charm

Claude was talking and gesticulating ardently Roses head was bent and
the tears were rolling down her cheeks Suddenly Claude raised his hat
and with a passionate gesture of renunciation walked swiftly to the
wagon and looking back once drove off with the utmost speed of which
the Brookss horse was capableRose waving him a farewell with one
hand and wiping her eyes with the other




X The Turquoise Ring


Stephen stood absolutely still in front of the opening in the trees and
as Rose turned she met him face to face She had never dreamed his eyes
could be so stern his mouth so hard and she gave a sob like a child

You seem to be in trouble Stephen said in a voice so cold she thought
it could not be his

I am not in trouble exactly Rose stammered concealing her
discomfiture as well as possible I am a little unhappy because I
have made some one else unhappy and now that you know it you will be
unhappy too and angry besides I suppose though youve seen everything
there was to see

There is no occasion for sorrow Stephen said I did nt mean to
break in on any interview I came over to give you back your freedom
If you ever cared enough for me to marry me the time has gone by I am
willing to own that I overpersuaded you but I am not the man to take a
girl against her inclinations so we will say goodbye and end the thing
here and now I can only wishhere his smothered rage at fate almost
choked himthat when you were selecting another husband you had
chosen a whole man

Rose quivered with the scorn of his tone Size is nt everything she
blazed

Not in bodies perhaps but it counts for something in hearts and
brains and it is convenient to have a sense of honor thats at least as
big as a grain of mustardseed

Claude Merrill is not dishonorable Rose exclaimed impetuously or
at least he is nt as bad as you think he has never asked me to marry
him

Then he probably was not quite ready to speak or perhaps you were not
quite ready to hear retorted Stephen bitterly but dont let us have
wordstherell be enough to regret without adding those I have seen
ever since New Years that you were not really happy or contented only
I would nt allow it to myself I kept hoping against hope that I was
mistaken There have been times when I would have married you willing
or unwilling but I did nt love you so well then and now that theres
another man in the case its different and Im strong enough to do the
right thing Follow your heart and be happy in a year or two I shall be
glad I had the grit to tell you so Goodbye Rose

Rose pale with amazement summoned all her pride and drawing the
turquoise engagement ring from her finger handed it silently to
Stephen hiding her face as he flung it vehemently down the riverbank
His dull eyes followed it and half uncomprehendingly saw it settle and
glisten in a nest of brown pineneedles Then he put out his hand for a
last clasp and strode away without a word

Presently Rose heard first the scrape of his boat on the sand then
the soft sound of his paddles against the water then nothing but
the squirrels and the woodpeckers and the thrushes then not even
thesenothing but the beating of her own heart

She sat down heavily feeling as if she were wide awake for the first
time in many weeks How had things come to this pass with her

Claude Merrill had flattered her vanity and given her some moments of
restlessness and dissatisfaction with her lot but he had not until
today really touched her heart or tempted her even momentarily from
her allegiance to Stephen His eyes had always looked unspeakable
things his voice had seemed to breathe feelings that he had never dared
put in words but today he had really stirred her for although he had
still been vague it was easy to see that his love for her had passed
all bounds of discretion She remembered his impassioned farewells his
despair his doubt as to whether he could forget her by plunging into
the vortex of business or whether he had better end it all in the
river as so many other brokenhearted fellows had done She had been
touched by his misery even against her better judgment and she had
intended to confess it all to Stephen sometime telling him that she
should never again accept attentions from a stranger lest a tragedy
like this should happen twice in a lifetime

She had imagined that Stephen would be his largeminded
greathearted magnanimous self and beg her to forget this fascinating
willothewisp by resting in his deeper serener love She had meant
to be contrite and faithful praying nightly that poor Claude might live
down his present anguish of which she had been the innocent cause

Instead what had happened She had been put altogether in the wrong
Stephen had almost cast her off and that too without argument He
had given her her liberty before she had asked for it taking it for
granted without question that she desired to be rid of him Instead
of comforting her in her remorse or sympathizing with her for so
nobly refusing to shine in Claudes larger world of Boston Stephen had
assumed that she was disloyal in every particular

And pray how was she to cope with such a disagreeable and complicated
situation

It would not be long before the gossips rolled under their tongues the
delicious morsel of a broken engagement and sooner or later she must
brave the displeasure of her grandmother

And the little housethat was worse than anything Her tears flowed
faster as she thought of Stephens joy in it of his faithful labor of
the savings he had invested in it She hated and despised herself
when she thought of the house and for the first time in her life she
realized the limitations of her nature the poverty of her ideals

What should she do She had lost Stephen and ruined his life Now in
order that she need not blight a second career must she contrive to
return Claudes love To be sure she thought it seemed indecent to
marry any other man than Stephen when they had built a house together
and chosen wallpapers and a kitchen stove and diningroom chairs but
was it not the only way to evade the difficulties

Suppose that Stephen in a fit of pique should ask somebody else to
share the new cottage

As this dreadful possibility came into view Roses sobs actually
frightened the birds and the squirrels She paced back and forth under
the trees wondering how she could have been engaged to a man for eight
months and know so little about him as she seemed to know about Stephen
Waterman today Who would have believed he could be so autocratic so
severe SS so unapproachable Who could have foreseen that she Rose
Wiley would ever be given up to another manhanded over as coolly as
if she had been a bale of cotton She wanted to return Claude Merrills
love because it was the only way out of the tangle but at the moment
she almost hated him for making so much trouble for hurting Stephen
for abasing her in her own eyes and above all for giving her rustic
lover the chance of impersonating an injured emperor

It did not simplify the situation to have Mite Shapley come in during
the evening and run upstairs uninvited to sit on the foot of her bed
and chatter

Rose had closed her blinds and lay in the dark pleading a headache
Mite was in high feather She had met Claude Merrill going to the
station that afternoon He was much too early for the train which the
station agent reported to be behind time so he had asked her to take
a drive She did nt know how it happened for he looked at his watch
every now and then but anyway they got to laughing and carrying on
and when they came back to the station the train had gone Was nt that
the greatest joke of the season What did Rose suppose they did next

Rose did nt know and did nt care her head ached too badly

Well they had driven to Wareham and Claude had hired a livery team
there and had been taken into Portland with his trunk and she had
brought Mrs Brookss horse back to Edgewood Was nt that ridiculous
And had nt she cut out Rose where she least expected

Rose was distinctly apathetic and Mite Shapley departed after a very
brief call leaving behind her an entirely new train of thought

If Claude Merrill were so loveblighted that he could only by the
greatest selfcontrol keep from flinging himself into the river how
could he conceal his sufferings so completely from Mite Shapleylittle
shallowpated scheming coquette


So that pretty Merrill feller has gone has he mother inquired Old
Kennebec that night as he took off his wet shoes and warmed his feet
at the kitchen oven Well it aint a mite too soon I allers distrust
that pinkanwhite rosyposy kind of a man One of the most turrible
things that ever happened in Gardner was brought about by jest sech
a feller Mothers hed nt hardly ought to name their boy babies Claude
without they expect em to play the dickens with the girls I don know
nothin bout the fust Claude there aint none of em in the Bible air
they but whoever he was I bate ye he hed a deceivin tongue If it
hed nt ben for me that Claude in Gardner would a run away with
my brothers fust wife an Ill tell ye jest how I contrived to put a
spoke in his wheel

But Mrs Wiley being already somewhat familiar with the circumstances
had taken her candle and retired to her virtuous couch




XI Rose Sees the World


Was this the world after all Rose asked herself and if so what
was amiss with it and where was the charm the bewilderment the
intoxication the glamour

She had been glad to come to Boston for the last two weeks in Edgewood
had proved intolerable She had always been a favorite heretofore from
the days when the boys fought for the privilege of dragging her sled
up the hills and filling her tiny mitten with peppermints down to
the year when she came home from the Wareham Female Seminary an
acknowledged belle and beauty Suddenly she had felt her popularity
dwindling There was no real change in the demeanor of her
acquaintances but there was a certain subtle difference of atmosphere
Everybody sympathized tacitly with Stephen and she did not wonder for
there were times when she secretly took his part against herself Only
a few candid friends had referred to the rupture openly in conversation
but these had been blunt in their disapproval

It seemed part of her ill fortune that just at this time Rufus should
be threatened with partial blindness and that Stephens heart already
sore should be torn with new anxieties She could hardly bear to see
the doctors carriage drive by day after day and hear night after night
that Rufus was unresigned melancholy half mad while Stephen as the
doctor said was brother mother and father in one as gentle as a
woman as firm as Gibraltar

These foes to her peace of mind all came from within but without was
the hourly reproach of her grandmother whose scorching tongue touched
every sensitive spot in the girls nature and burned it like fire

Finally a way of escape opened Mrs Wealthy Brooks who had always been
rheumatic grew suddenly worse She had heard of a magnetic physician
in Boston also of one who used electricity with wonderful effect and
she announced her intention of taking both treatments impartially and
alternately The neighbors were quite willing that Wealthy Ann Brooks
should spend the deceased Ezras money in any way she pleasedshe
had earned it goodness knows by living with him for twentyfive
yearsbut before the day for her departure arrived her right arm
and knee became so much more painful that it was impossible for her to
travel alone

At this juncture Rose was called upon to act as nurse and companion in
a friendly way She seized the opportunity hungrily as a way out of her
present trouble but knowing what Mrs Brookss temper was in time of
health she could see clearly what it was likely to prove when pain and
anguish wrung the brow

Rose had been in Boston now for some weeks and she was sitting in the
Joy Street boardinghouseJoy Street forsooth It was nearly bedtime
and she was looking out upon a huddle of roofs and back yards upon
a landscape filled with clotheslines ashbarrels and illfed cats
There were no sleek country tabbies with the memory in their eyes of
tasted cream nothing but cityborn citybred thin despairing cats of
the pavement cats no more forlorn than Rose herself

She had seen Boston for she had accompanied Mrs Brooks in the
horsecars daily to the two different temples of healing where that
lady worshiped and offered sacrifices She had also gone with Maude
Arthurlena to Claude Merrills store to buy a pair of gloves and had
overheard Miss Dix the fashionable lady assistant before mentioned
say to Miss Brackett of the ribbon department that she thought Mr
Merrill must have worn his blinders that time he stayed so long in
Edgewood This bit of polished irony was unintelligible to Rose at
first but she mastered it after an hours reflection She was nt
looking her best that day she knew the cotton dresses that seemed
so pretty at home were common and countrified here and her best black
cashmere looked cheap and shapeless beside Miss Dixs brilliantine Miss
Dixs figure was her strong point and her dressmaker was particularly
skillful in the arts of suggestion concealment and revelation Beauty
has its chosen backgrounds Rose in white dimity standing knee deep in
her blossoming brier bushes the river running at her feet dark pine
trees behind her graceful head sounded depths and touched heights of
harmony forever beyond the reach of the modish Miss Dix but she was out
of her element and suffered accordingly

Rose had gone to walk with Claude one evening when she first arrived He
had shown her the State House and the Park Street Church and sat with
her on one of the benches in the Common until nearly ten She knew that
Mrs Brooks had told her nephew of the broken engagement but he made no
reference to the matter save to congratulate her that she was rid of
a man who was so clumsy so dull and behind the times as Stephen
Waterman saying that he had always marveled she could engage herself to
anybody who could insult her by offering her a turquoise ring

Claude was very interesting that evening Rose thought but
rather gloomy and unlike his former self He referred to his grave
responsibilities to the frail health of Maude Arthurlena and to the
vicissitudes of business He vaguely intimated that his daily life in
the store was not so pleasant as it had been formerly that there
were those he would speak no more plainly who embarrassed him with
undesired attentions those who without the smallest shadow of right
vexed him with petty jealousies

Rose dared not ask questions on so delicate a topic but she remembered
in a flash Miss Dixs heavy eyebrows snapping eyes and high color
Claude seemed very happy that Rose had come to Boston though he was
surprised knowing what a trial his aunt must be now that she was so
helpless It was unfortunate also that Rose could not go on excursions
without leaving his aunt alone or he should have been glad to offer his
escort He pressed her hand when he left her at her door telling her
she could never realize what a comfort her friendship was to him
could never imagine how thankful he was that she had courageously freed
herself from ties that in time would have made her wretched His heart
was full he said of feelings he dared not utter but in the near
future when certain clouds had rolled by he would unlock its
treasures and thenbut no more tonight he could not trust himself

Rose felt as if she were assuming one of the characters in a mysterious
romance such as unfolded itself only in books or in Boston but
thrilling as it was it was nevertheless extremely unsatisfactory

Convinced that Claude Merrill was passionately in love with her one of
her reasons for coming to Boston had been to fall more deeply in love
with him and thus heal some at least of the wounds she had inflicted
It may have been a foolish idea but after three weeks it seemed still
worsea useless one for after several interviews she felt herself
drifting farther and farther from Claude and if he felt any burning
ambition to make her his own he certainly concealed it with admirable
art Given up with the most offensive magnanimity by Stephen and not
greatly desired by Claudethat seemed the present status of proud Rose
Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood

It was June she remembered as she leaned out of the open window at
least it was June in Edgewood and she supposed for convenience sake
they called it June in Boston Not that it mattered much what the poor
city prisoners called it How beautiful the river would be at home with
the trees along the banks in full leaf How she hungered and thirsted
for the riverto see it sparkle in the sunlight to watch the
moonglade stretching from one bank to the other to hear the soft lap
of the water on the shore and the distant murmur of the falls at the
bridge And the Brier Neighborhood would be at its loveliest for the
wild roses were in blossom by now And the little house How sweet it
must look under the shade of the elms with the Saco rippling at the
back Was poor Rufus still lying in a darkened room and was Stephen
nursing himdisappointed Stephen dear noble old Stephen




XII Gold and Pinchbeck


Just then Mrs Brooks groaned in the next room and called Rose who went
in to minister to her real needs or to condole with her fancied ones
whichever course of action appeared to be the more agreeable at the
moment

Mrs Brooks desired conversation it seemed or at least she desired an
audience for a monologue for she recognized no antiphonal obligations
on the part of her listeners The doctors were not doing her a speck of
good and she was just squandering money in a miserable boardinghouse
when she might be enjoying poor health in her own home and she did nt
believe her hens were receiving proper care and she had forgotten
to pull down the shades in the spare room and the sun would fade the
carpet out all white before she got back and she did nt believe Dr
Smiths magnetism was any more use than a cats foot nor Dr Robinsons
electricity any better than a bumblebees buzz and she had a great mind
to go home and try Dr Lord from Bonnie Eagle and there was a letter
for Rose on the bureau which had come before supper but the shiftless
lazy worthless landlady had forgotten to send it up till just now

The letter was from Mite Shapley but Rose could read only half of it to
Mrs Brooks little beside the news that the Waterman barn the finest
barn in the whole township had been struck by lightning and burned
to the ground Stephen was away at the time having taken Rufus to
Portland where an operation on his eyes would shortly be performed at
the hospital and one of the neighbors was sleeping at the River Farm
and taking care of the cattle still the house might not have been saved
but for one of Alcestis Crambrys sudden bursts of common sense which
occurred now quite regularly He succeeded not only in getting the
horses out of the stalls but gave the alarm so promptly that the whole
neighborhood was soon on the scene of action Stephen was the only man
Mite reminded Rose who ever had any patience with or took any pains to
teach Alcestis but he never could have expected to be rewarded in this
practical way The barn was only partly insured and when she had met
Stephen at the station next day and condoled with him on his loss
he had said Oh well Mite a little more or less does nt make much
difference just now

The rest would nt interest you Mrs Brooks said Rose precipitately
preparing to leave the room

Something about Claude I suppose ventured that astute lady I think
Mite kind of fancied him I dont believe he ever gave her any real
encouragement but hed make love to a pump Claude Merrill would and
so would his father before him How my sister Abby made out to land him
we never knew for they said hed proposed to every woman in the town
of Bingham not excepting the wooden Indian girl in front of the
cigarstore and not one of em but our Abby ever got a chance to name
the day Abby was as set as the everlastin hills and if shed made up
her mind to have a man he could nt wriggle away from her nohow in
the world It beats all how girls do run after these slickhaired
sweettongued Miss Nancy kind o fellers that aint but little good as
beaux an worth less than nothing as husbands

Rose scarcely noticed what Mrs Brooks said she was too anxious to read
the rest of Mite Shapleys letter in the quiet of her own room

 Stephen looks thin and pale so it ran on but he does not allow anybody
 to sympathize with him I think you ought to know something that I have nt
 told before for fear of hurting your feelings but if I were in your place
 Id like to hear everything and then youll know how to act when you come
 home Just after you left Stephen ploughed up all the land in front of
 your new houseevery inch of it all up and down the road between the
 fence and the front doorstepand then he planted corn where you were
 going to have your flowerbeds He has closed all the blinds and hung a To
 Let sign on the large elm at the gate Stephen never was spiteful in his
 life but this looks a little like spite Perhaps he only wanted to save
 his selfrespect and let people know that everything between you was over
 forever Perhaps he thought it would stop talk once and for all But you
 wont mind you lucky girl staying nearly three months in Boston So
 Almira purled on in violet ink with shaded letters How I wish it had
 come my way though Im not good at rubbing rheumatic patients even when
 they are _his_ aunt Is _he_ as devoted as ever And when will _it_ be How
 do you like the theater Mother thinks you wont attend but by what he
 used to say I am sure church members in Boston always go to amusements

 Your loving friend
 Almira Shapley

 PS They say Rufuss doctors bills here and the operation and hospital
 expenses in Portland will mount up to five hundred dollars Of course
 Stephen will be dreadfully hampered by the toss of his barn and maybe he
 wants to let your house that was to be because he really needs money In
 that case the dooryard wont be very attractive to tenants with corn
 planted right up to the steps and no path left Its two feet tall now and
 by August just when you were intending to move in it will hide the front
 windows Not that youll care with a diamond on your engagement finger


The letter was more than flesh and blood could stand and Rose flung
herself on her bed to think and regret and repent and if possible to
sob herself to sleep

She knew now that she had never admired and respected Stephen so much
as at the moment when under the reproach of his eyes she had given him
back his ring When she left Edgewood and parted with him forever she
had really loved him better than when she had promised to marry him

Claude Merrill on his native Boston heath did not appear the romantic
inspiring figure he had once been in her eyes A week ago she distrusted
him tonight she despised him

What had happened to Rose was the dilation of her vision She saw things
under a wider sky and in a clearer light Above all her heart was wrung
with pity for StephenStephen with no comforting womans hand to help
him in his sore trouble Stephen bearing his losses alone his burdens
and anxieties alone his nursing and daily work alone Oh how she felt
herself needed Needed that was the magic word that unlocked her better
nature Darkness is the time for making roots and establishing plants
whether of the soil or of the soul and all at once Rose had become a
woman a little one perhaps but a whole womanand a bit of an angel
too with healing in her wings When and how had this metamorphosis come
about Last summer the fragile brierrose had hung over the river and
looked at its pretty reflection in the placid surface of the water Its
few buds and blossoms were so lovely it sighed for nothing more The
changes in the plant had been wrought secretly and silently In some
mysterious way as common to soul as to plant life the roots had
gathered in more nourishment from the earth they had stored up strength
and force and all at once there was a marvelous fructifying of the
plant hardiness of stalk new shoots everywhere vigorous leafage and
a shower of blossoms

But everything was awry Boston was a failure Claude was a weakling and
a flirt her turquoise ring was lying on the riverbank Stephen did
not love her any longer her flowerbeds were ploughed up and planted in
corn and the cottage that Stephen had built and she had furnished that
beloved cottage was to let

She was in Boston but what did that amount to after all What was
the State House to a bleeding heart or the Old South Church to a pride
wounded like hers

At last she fell asleep but it was only by stopping her ears to the
noises of the city streets and making herself imagine the sound of
the river rippling under her bedroom windows at home The backyards of
Boston faded and in their place came the banks of the Saco strewn
with pineneedles fragrant with wild flowers Then there was the bit of
sunny beach where Stephen moored his boat She could hear the sound of
his paddle Boston lovers came acourting in the horsecars but hers
had floated downstream to her just at dusk in a birchbark canoe or
sometimes in the moonlight on a couple of logs rafted together

But it was all over now and she could see only Stephens stern face as
he flung the despised turquoise ring down the riverbank




XIII A Country Chevalier


It was early in August when Mrs Wealthy Brooks announced her speedy
return from Boston to Edgewood

Its jest as well Rose is comin back said Mr Wiley to his wife I
never favored her goin to Boston where that rosyposy Claude feller
is When he was down here he was kep kind o tied up in a boxstall
but there hes caperin loose round the pastur

I should think Rose would be ashamed to come back after the way shes
carried on remarked Mrs Wiley but if she needed punishment I guess
shes got it bein compnykeeper to Wealthy Ann Brooks Bein a church
member in good an reglar standin I spose Wealthy Annll go to
heaven but I can only say that it would be a sight pleasanter place for
a good many if she did nt

Rose has ben foolish an flirty an wrongheaded allowed her
grandfather but it wont do no good to treat her like a hardened
criminile sames you did afore she went away She aint hardly got her
wisdom teeth cut in love affairs She aint broke the laws of the
State o Maine nor any o the ten commandments she aint disgraced the
family an theres a chance for her to reform seein as how she aint
twenty year old yet I was turrible wild an hotheaded myself afore you
ketched me an tamed me down

You aint so tame now as I wish you was Mrs Wiley replied testily

If you could smoke a clay pipe t would calm your nerves mother an
help you to git some philosophy inter you you need a little philosophy
turrible bad

I need patience considable more was Mrs Wileys withering retort

Thats the way with folks said Old Kennebec reflectively as he went
on peacefully puffing If you try to indoose em to take an intrest in
a brannew virtue they wont look at it but they ll run down a side
street an buy half a yard more o some turrible old shopworn trait
o character that theyve kep in stock all their lives an that
everybodys sick to death of There was a man in Gardner

But alas the experiences of the Gardiner man though told in the same
delightful fashion that had won Mrs Wileys heart many years
before now fell upon the empty air In these years of Old Kennebecs
anecdotage his pipe was his best listener and his truest confidant

Mr Wileys constant intercessions with his wife made Roses homecoming
somewhat easier and the sight of her own room and belongings soothed
her troubled spirit but the days went on and nothing happened to
change the situation She had lost a lover that was all and there were
plenty more to choose from or there always had been but the only one
she wanted was the one who made no sign She used to think that she
could twist Stephen around her little finger that she had only to
beckon to him and he would follow her to the ends of the earth Now fear
had entered her heart She no longer felt sure because she no longer
felt worthy of him and feeling both uncertainty and unworthiness her
lips were sealed and she was rendered incapable of making any bid for
forgiveness

So the little world of Pleasant River went on to all outward seeming
as it had ever gone On one side of the stream a girls heart was
longing and pining and sickening with hope deferred and growing
too with such astonishing rapidity that the very angels marveled And
on the other a mans whole vision of life and duty was widening and
deepening under the fructifying influence of his sorrow

The corn waved high and green in front of the vacant riverside cottage
but Stephen sent no word or message to Rose He had seen her once but
only from a distance She seemed paler and thinner he thoughtthe
result probably of her metropolitan gayeties He heard no rumor of any
engagement and he wondered if it were possible that her love for Claude
Merrill had not after all been returned in kind This seemed a wild
impossibility His mind refused to entertain the supposition that any
man on earth could resist falling in love with Rose or having fallen
in that he could ever contrive to climb out So he worked on at his
farm harder than ever and grew soberer and more careworn daily Rufus
had never seemed so near and dear to him as in these weeks when he had
lived under the shadow of threatened blindness The burning of the barn
and the strain upon their slender property brought the brothers together
shoulder to shoulder

If you lose your girl Steve said the boy and I lose my eyesight
and we both lose the barn why itll be us two against the world for a
spell

The To Let sign on the little house was an arrant piece of hypocrisy
Nothing but the direst extremity could have caused him to allow an alien
step on that sacred threshold The ploughing up of the flowerbeds and
planting of the corn had served a double purpose It showed the too
curious public the finality of his break with Rose and her absolute
freedom it also prevented them from suspecting that he still entered
the place His visits were not many but he could not bear to let the
dust settle on the furniture that he and Rose had chosen together and
whenever he locked the door and went back to the River Farm he thought
of a verse in the Bible Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the
Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken


It was now Friday of the last week in August

The river was full of logs thousands upon thousands of them covering
the surface of the water from the bridge almost up to the Brier
Neighborhood The Edgewood drive was late owing to a long drought and
low water but it was to begin on the following Monday and Lije Dennett
and his under boss were looking over the situation and planning the
campaign As they leaned over the bridgerail they saw Mr Wiley driving
clown the river road When he caught sight of them he hitched the old
white horse at the corner and walked toward them filling his pipe the
while in his usual leisurely manner Were not busy this forenoon
said Lije Dennett Spose we stand right here and let Old Kennebec have
his say out for once Weve never heard the end of one of his stories
an hes ben talkin for twenty years

All right rejoined his companion with a broad grin at the idea Im
willin if you are but whos goin to tell our famlies the reason
weve deserted em I bate yer we shant budge till the crack o doom
The road commissionerll come along once a year and mend the bridge
under our feet but Old Kennebecll talk straight on till the day o
jedgment

Mr Wiley had one of the most enjoyable mornings of his life and felt
that after half a century of neglect his powers were at last appreciated
by his fellow citizens

He proposed numerous strategic movements to be made upon the logs
whereby they would move more swiftly than usual He described several
successful drives on the Kennebec when the logs had melted down the
river almost by magic owing to his generalship and he paid a tribute
in passing to the docility of the boss who on that occasion had never
moved a single log without asking his advice

From this topic he proceeded genially to narrate the lifehistories
of the boss the under boss and several Indians belonging to the
crewhistories in which he himself played a gallant and conspicuous
part The conversation then drifted naturally to the exploits of
riverdrivers in general and Mr Wiley narrated the sorts of feats in
logriding pickpolethrowing and the shooting of rapids that he had
done in his youth These stories were such as had seldom been heard by
the ear of man and as they passed into circulation instantaneously we
are probably enjoying some of them to this day

They were still being told when a Crambry child appeared on the bridge
bearing a note for the old man Upon reading it he moved off rapidly in
the direction of the store ejaculating Bless my soul I clean forgot
that saleratus and mothers settin at the kitchen table with the bowl
in her lap waitin for it Got so intrested in your listnin I never
thought o the time

The connubial discussion that followed this breach of discipline began
on the arrival of the saleratus and lasted through supper and Rose
went to bed almost immediately afterward for very dullness and apathy
Her life stretched out before her in the most aimless and monotonous
fashion She saw nothing but heartache in the future and that she
richly deserved it made it none the easier to bear

Feeling feverish and sleepless she slipped on her gray Shaker cloak
and stole quietly downstairs for a breath of air Her grandfather and
grandmother were talking on the piazza and good humor seemed to have
been restored I was over to the tavern tonight she heard him say
as she sat down at a little distance I was over to the tavern tonight
an a feller from Gorham got to talkin an braggin bout what a stock
o goods they kep in the store over there An says I I bate ye
dollars to doughnuts that there haint a darn thing ye can ask for at
Bill Pikes store at Pleasant River that he cant go down cellar or up
attic or out in the barn chamber an git for ye Well sir he took me
up an I borrered the money of Joe Dennett who held the stakes an
we went right over to Bill Pikes with all the boys follerin on behind
An the Gorham man never let on what he was going to ask for till the
hull crowd of us got inside the store Then says he as plite as a
basket o chips Mr Pike Id like to buy a pulpit if you can oblige
me with one

Bill scratched his head an I held my breath Then says he Pears to
me Id ought to hev a pulpit or two if I can jest remember where I keep
em I dont never callate to be out o pulpits but Im so plagued for
room I cant keep em in here with the grocries Jim thats his new
store boy you jest take a lantern an run out in the far corner o the
shed at the end o the hickory woodpile an see how many pulpits weve
got in stock Well Jim run out an when he come back he says Weve
got two Mr Pike Shall I bring one of em in

At that the boys all bust out laughin an hollerin an tauntin the
Gorham man an he paid up with a good will I tell ye

I dont approve of bettin said Mrs Wiley grimly but Ill try to
sanctify the money by usin it for a new washboiler

The fact is explained Old Kennebec somewhat confused that the boys
made me spend every cent of it then an there

Rose heard her grandmothers caustic reply and then paid no further
attention until her keen ear caught the sound of Stephens name It was
a part of her unhappiness that since her broken engagement no one
would ever allude to him and she longed to hear him mentioned so that
perchance she could get some inkling of his movements

I met Stephen tonight for the first time in a week said Mr Wiley
He kind o keeps out o my way lately Hes goin to drive his span
into Portland tomorrow mornin and bring Rufus home from the hospital
Sunday afternoon The doctors think theyve made a success of their job
but Rufus has got to be bandaged up a spell longer Stephen is goin to
join the drive Monday mornin at the bridge here so Ill get the latest
news o the boy Land Ill be turrible glad if he gets out with his
eyesight if its only for Steves sake Hes a turrible good fellow
Steve is He said something tonight that made me set more store by him
than ever I told you I hed nt heard an unkind word agin Rose sence
she come home from Boston an no more I hev till this evenin There
was two or three fellers talkin in the postoffice an they did nt
suspicion I was settin on the steps outside the screen door That Jim
Jenkins that Rose so everlastinly snubbed at the tavern dance spoke
up an says he This time last year Rose Wiley could a hed the
choice of any man on the river an now I bet ye she cant get nary
one

Steve was there jest goin out the door with some bags o coffee an
sugar under his arm

I guess youre mistaken about that he says speakin up jest like
lightnin so long as Stephen Watermans alive Rose Wiley can have
him for one and that everybodys welcome to know

He spoke right out loud an plain jest as if he was readin the
Declaration of Independence I expected the boys would everlastinly
poke fun at him but they never said a word I guess his eyes flashed
for he come out the screen door slammin it after him and stalked by
me as if he was too worked up to notice anything or anybody I did nt
foller him for his long legs git over the ground too fast for me but
thinks I Mebbe Ill hev some use for my lemonadeset after all

I hope to the land you will responded Mrs Wiley for Im about sick
o movin it round when I sweep under my bed And I shall be glad if
Rose an Stephen do make it up for Wealthy Ann Brookss gossip is too
much for a Christian woman to stand




XIV Housebreaking


Where was the pale Rose the faded Rose that crept noiselessly down
from her room wanting neither to speak nor to be spoken to Nobody ever
knew She vanished forever and in her place a thing of sparkles and
dimples flashed up the stairway and closed the door softly There was
a streak of moonshine lying across the bare floor and a merry ghost
with dressinggown held prettily away from bare feet danced a gay
fandango among the yellow moonbeams There were breathless flights to
the open window and kisses thrown in the direction of the River Farm
There were impressive declamations at the lookingglass where a radiant
creature pointed to her reflection and whispered Worthless little pig
he loves you after all

Then when quiet joy had taken the place of mad delight there was a
swoop down upon the floor an impetuous hiding of brimming eyes in the
white counterpane and a dozen impassioned promises to herself and to
something higher than herself to be a better girl

The mood lasted and deepened and still Rose did not move Her heart
was on its knees before Stephens faithful love his chivalry his
strength Her troubled spirit like a frail boat tossed about in the
rapids seemed entering a quiet harbor where there were protecting
shores and a still still evening star Her sails were all torn
and drooping but the harbor was in sight and the poor little
weatherbeaten craft could rest in peace

A period of grave reflection now ensued under the bedclothes where one
could think better Suddenly an inspiration seized her an inspiration
so original so delicious and above all so humble and praiseworthy
that it brought her head from her pillow and she sat bolt upright
clapping her hands like a child

The very thing she whispered to herself gleefully It will take
courage but Im sure of my ground after what he said before them all
and Ill do it Grandma in Biddeford buying church carpets Stephen in
Portlandwas ever such a chance

The same glowing Rose came downstairs two steps at a time next
morning bade her grandmother goodbye with suspicious pleasure and sent
her grandfather away on an errand which with attendant conversation
would consume half the day Then bundles after bundles and baskets after
baskets were packed into the wagonbehind the seat beneath the seat
and finally under the laprobe She gave a dramatic flourish to the
whip drove across the bridge went through Pleasant River village
and up the leafy road to the little house stared the To Let sign
scornfully in the eye alighted and ran like a deer through the aisles
of waving corn past the kitchen windows to the back door

If he has kept the big key in the old place under the stone where
we both used to find it then he has nt forgotten meor anything
thought Rose

The key was there and Rose lifted it with a sob of gratitude It was
but five minutes work to carry all the bundles from the wagon to the
back steps and another five to lead old Tom across the road into the
woods and tie him to a tree quite out of the sight of any passerby

When after running back she turned the key in the lock her heart
gave a leap almost of terror and she started at the sound of her own
footfall Through the open door the sunlight streamed into the dark
room She flew to tables and chairs and gave a rapid sweep of the hand
over their surfaces

He has been dusting hereand within a few days too she thought
triumphantly

The kitchen was perfection as she always knew it would be with one
door opening to the shaded road and the other looking on the river
windows too framing the appleorchard and the elms She had chosen
the furniture but how differently it looked now that it was actually
in place The tiny shed had piles of split wood with great boxes of
kindlings and shavings all in readiness for the bride who would do her
own cooking Who but Stephen would have made the very wood ready for a
womans homecoming and why had he done so much in May when they
were not to be married until August Then the door of the bedroom was
stealthily opened and here Rose sat down and cried for joy and shame
and hope and fear The very flowered paper she had refused as too
expensive How lovely it looked with the white chamber set She brought
in her simple wedding outfit of blankets bedlinen and counterpanes
and folded them softly in the closet and then for the rest of the
morning she went from room to room doing all that could remain
undiscovered even to laying a fire in the new kitchen stove

This was the plan Stephen must pass the house on his way from the River
Farm to the bridge where he was to join the riverdrivers on Monday
morning She would be out of bed by the earliest peep of dawn put on
Stephens favorite pink calico leave a note for her grandmother run
like a hare down her side of the river and up Stephens steal into
the house open blinds and windows light the fire and set the kettle
boiling Then with a sharp knife she would cut down two rows of corn
and thus make a green pathway from the front kitchen steps to the road
Next the false and insulting To Let sign would be forcibly tweaked
from the tree and thrown into the grass She would then lay the table
in the kitchen and make ready the nicest breakfast that two people ever
sat down to And oh would two people sit down to it or would one go
off in a rage and the other die of grief and disappointment

Then having done all she would wait and palpitate and palpitate and
wait until Stephen came Surely no propertyowner in the universe could
drive along a road observe his corn leveled to the earth his sign
removed his house open and smoke issuing from his chimney without
going in to surprise the rogue and villain who could be guilty of such
vandalism

And when he came in

Oh she had all day Sunday in which to forecast with mingled dread and
gladness and suspense that allimportant alldecisive first moment
All day Sunday to frame and unframe penitent speeches All day Sunday
Would it ever be Monday If so what would Tuesday bring Would the sun
rise happy on Mrs Stephen Waterman of Pleasant River or miserable Miss
Rose Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood




XV The Dream Room


Long ago when Stephen was a boy of fourteen or fifteen he had gone
with his father to a distant town to spend the night After an early
breakfast next morning his father had driven off for a business
interview and left the boy to walk about during his absence He
wandered aimlessly along a quiet side street and threw himself down on
the grass outside a pretty garden to amuse himself as best he could

After a few minutes he heard voices and turning peeped through the
bars of the gate in idle boyish curiosity It was a small brown house
the kitchen door was open and a table spread with a white cloth was set
in the middle of the room There was a cradle in a far corner and a man
was seated at the table as though he might be waiting for his breakfast

There is a kind of sentiment about the kitchen in New England a kind of
sentiment not provoked by other rooms Here the farmer drops in to spend
a few minutes when he comes back from the barn or field on an errand
Here in the great clean sweet comfortable place the busy housewife
lives sometimes rocking the cradle sometimes opening and shutting
the oven door sometimes stirring the pot darning stockings paring
vegetables or mixing goodies in a yellow bowl The children sit on
the steps stringing beans shelling peas or hulling berries the cat
sleeps on the floor near the woodbox and the visitor feels exiled if
he stays in sittingroom or parlor for here where the mother is always
busy is the heart of the farmhouse

There was an open back door to this kitchen a door framed in
morningglories and the woman or was she only girl standing at the
stove was prettyoh so pretty in Stephens eyes His boyish heart
went out to her on the instant She poured a cup of coffee and
walked with it to the table then an unexpected interesting thing
happenedsomething the boy ought not to have seen and never forgot
The man putting out his hand to take the cup looked up at the pretty
woman with a smile and she stooped and kissed him

Stephen was fifteen As he looked on the instant he became a man with
a mans hopes desires ambitions He looked eagerly hungrily and the
scene burned itself on the sensitive plate of his young heart so that
as he grew older he could take the picture out in the dark from time
to time and look at it again When he first met Rose he did not know
precisely what she was to mean to him but before long when he closed
his eyes and the old familiar picture swam into his field of vision
behold by some spiritual chemistry the pretty womans face had given
place to that of Rose

All such teasing visions had been sternly banished during this sorrowful
summer and it was a thoughtful sober Stephen who drove along the road
on this mellow August morning The dust was deep the goldenrod waved
its imperial plumes making the humble waysides gorgeous the river
chattered and sparkled till it met the logs at the Brier Neighborhood
and then lapsing into silence flowed steadily under them till it found
a vent for its spirits in the dashing and splashing of the falls

Haying was over logging was to begin that day then harvesting then
woodcutting then eternal successions of ploughing sowing reaping
haying logging harvesting and so on to the endless end of his days
Here and there a red or a yellow branch painted only yesterday caught
his eye and made him shiver He was not ready for winter his heart
still craved the summer it had missed

Hello What was that Cornstalks prone on the earth Sign torn down and
lying flat in the grass Blinds open fire in the chimney

He leaped from the wagon and flinging the reins to Alcestis Crambry
said Stay right here out of sight and dont you move till I call
you And striding up the green pathway he flung open the kitchen door

A forest of corn waving in the doorway at the back morningglories
clambering round and round the windowframes the table with shining
white cloth the kettle humming and steaming something bubbling in a
pan on the stove the fire throwing out sweet little gleams of welcome
through the open damper All this was taken in with one incredulous
rapturous twinkle of an eye but something else too Rose of all roses
Rose of the river Rose of the world standing behind a chair with her
hand pressed against her heart her lips parted her breath coming and
going She was glowing like a jewelglowing with the extraordinary
brilliancy that emotion gives to some women She used to be happy in a
gay sparkling way like the shallow part of the stream as it chatters
over white pebbles and bright sands Now it was a broad steady full
happiness like the deeps of the river under the sun

Dont speak Stephen till you hear what I have to say It takes a good
deal of courage for a girl to do as I am doing but I want to show how
sorry I am and its the only way She was trembling and the words
came faster and faster Ive been very wrong and foolish and made you
very unhappy but I have nt done what you would have hated most I have
nt been engaged to Claude Merrill he has nt so much as asked me I am
here to beg you to forgive me to eat breakfast with me to drive me to
the ministers and marry me quickly quickly before anything happens
to prevent us and then to bring me home here to live all the days of my
life Oh Stephen dear honestly honestly you have nt lost anything
in all this long miserable summer Ive suffered too and Im better
worth loving than I was Will you take me back

Rose had a tremendous power of provoking and holding love and Stephen
of loving His was too generous a nature for revilings and complaints
and reproaches

The shores of his heart were strewn with the wreckage of the troubled
summer but if the tide of love is high enough it washes such things
out of remembrance He just opened his arms and took Rose to his heart
faults and all with joy and gratitude and she was as happy as a child
who has escaped the scolding it richly deserves and who determines for
very thankfulness sake never to be naughty again

You dont know what youve done for me Stephen she whispered with
her face hidden on his shoulder I was just a common little prickly
rosebush when you came along like a good gardener and grafted in
something better the something better was your love Stephen dear and
its made everything different The silly Rose you were engaged to long
ago has disappeared somewhere I hope you wont be able to find her
under the new leaves

She was all I wanted said Stephen

You thought she was the girl answered because you did nt see the
prickles but youd have felt them some time The old Rose was a selfish
thing not good enough for you the new Rose is going to be your wife
and Rufuss sister and your mothers daughter all in one

Then such a breakfast was spread as Stephen in his sorry years of
bachelor existence had forgotten could exist but before he broke his
fast he ran out to the wagon and served the astonished Alcestis with his
wedding refreshments then and there bidding him drive back to the
River Farm and bring him a package that lay in the drawer of his
shavingstanda package placed there when hot youth and love and
longing had inspired him to hurry on the marriage day

Theres an envelope Alcestis he cried a long envelope way way
back in the corner and a small box on top of it Bring them both and my
wallet too and if you find them all and get them to me safely you shall
be bridesmaid and groomsman and best man and usher and maid of honor at
a wedding in less than an hour Off with you Drive straight and use
the whip on Dolly

When he reentered the kitchen flushed with joy and excitement Rose
put the various good things on the table and he almost tremblingly took
his seat fearing that contact with the solid wood might wake him from
this entrancing vision

Id like to put you in your chair like a queen and wait on you he
said with a soft boyish stammer but I am too dazed with happiness to
be of any use

Its my turn to wait upon you and IOh how I love to have you
dazed Rose answered Ill be at the table presently myself but we
have been housekeeping only three minutes and we have nothing but the
tin coffeepot this morning so Ill pour the coffee from the stove

She filled a cup with housewifely care and brought it to Stephens side
As she set it down and was turning she caught his looka look so full
of longing that no loving woman however busy could have resisted it
then she stooped and kissed him fondly fervently

Stephen put his arm about her and drawing her down to his knee rested
his head against her soft shoulder with a sigh of comfort like that
of a tired child He had waited for it ten years and at last the dream
room had come true





THE OLD PEABODY PEW

A Christmas Romance of a Country Church


DEDICATION

To a certain handful of dear New England women of names unknown to the
world dwelling in a certain quiet village alike unknown

We have worked together to make our little corner of the great universe
a pleasanter place in which to live and so we know not only one
anothers names but something of one anothers joys and sorrows cares
and burdens economies hopes and anxieties

We all remember the dusty uphill road that leads to the green church
common We remember the white spire pointing upward against a background
of blue sky and feathery elms We remember the sound of the bell
that falls on the Sabbath morning stillness calling us across the
daisysprinkled meadows of June the golden hayfields of July or the
dazzling whiteness and deep snowdrifts of December days The little
cabinetorgan that plays the Doxology the hymnbooks from which we sing
Praise God from whom all blessings flow the sweet freshness of the
old meetinghouse within and withouthow we have toiled to secure and
preserve these humble mercies for ourselves and our children

There really is a Dorcas Society as you and I well know and one
not unlike that in these pages and you and I have lived through many
discouraging laughable and beautiful experiences while we emulated the
Bible Dorcas that woman full of good works and alms deeds

There never was a Peabody Pew in the Tory Hill MeetingHouse and
Nancys love story and Justins never happened within its centuryold
walls but I have imagined only one of the many romances that have had
their birth under the shadow of that steeple did we but realize it

As you have sat there on openwindowed Sundays looking across purple
cloverfields to blue distant mountains watching the palmleaf fans
swaying to and fro in the warm stillness before sermon time did not the
place seem full of memories for has not the life of two villages ebbed
and flowed beneath that ancient roof You heard the hum of droning
bees and followed the airy wings of butterflies fluttering over
the gravestones in the old churchyard and underneath almost every
mossgrown tablet some humble romance lies buried and all but forgotten

If it had not been for you I should never have written this story so I
give it back to you tied with a sprig from Ophelias nosegay a sprig of
rosemary thats for remembrance

August 1907




I The Old Peabody Pew

Edgewood like all the other villages along the banks of the Saco
is full of sunny slopes and leafy hollows There are little rounded
greenclad hillocks that might like their scriptural sisters skip
with joy and there are grand rocky hills tufted with gaunt pine
treesthese leading the eye to the splendid heights of a neighbor
State where snowcrowned peaks tower in the blue distance sweeping the
horizon in a long line of majesty

Tory Hill holds its own among the others for peaceful beauty and fair
prospect and on its broad level summit sits the whitepainted Orthodox
MeetingHouse This faces a grassy common where six roads meet as if
the early settlers had determined that no one should lack salvation
because of a difficulty in reaching its visible source

The old church has had a dignified and fruitful past dating from that
day in 1761 when young Paul Coffin received his call to preach at a
stipend of fifty pounds sterling a year answering that never having
heard of any Uneasiness among the people about his Doctrine or manner of
life he declared himself pleased to Settle as Soon as might be Judged
Convenient

But that was a hundred and fifty years ago and much has happened since
those simple strenuous old days The chastening hand of time has been
laid somewhat heavily on the town as well as on the church Some of
her sons have marched to the wars and died on the field of honor some
seeking better fortunes have gone westward others wearying of village
life the rocky soil and rigors of farmwork have become entangled
in the noise and competition the rush and strife of cities When the
sexton rings the bell nowadays on a Sunday morning it seems to have
lost some of its oldtime militant strength something of its hope and
courage but it still rings and although the Davids and Solomons
the Matthews Marks and Pauls of former congregations have left few
descendants to perpetuate their labors it will go on ringing as long as
there is a Tabitha a Dorcas a Lois or a Eunice left in the community

This sentiment had been maintained for a quarter of a century but it
was now especially strong as the old Tory Hill MeetingHouse had been
undergoing for several years more or less extensive repairs In point
of fact the still stronger word improvements might be used
with impunity though whenever the Dorcas Society being female and
therefore possessed of notions regarding comfort and beauty suggested
any serious changes the finance committees which were inevitably
male in their composition generally disapproved of making any impious
alterations in a tabernacle chapel temple or any other building used
for purposes of worship The majority in these august bodies asserted
that their ancestors had prayed and sung there for a century and a
quarter and what was good enough for their ancestors was entirely
suitable for them Besides the community was becoming less and less
prosperous and churchgoing was growing more and more lamentably
uncommon so that even from a business standpoint any sums expended
upon decoration by a poor and struggling parish would be worse than
wasted

In the particular year under discussion in this story the valiant
and progressive Mrs Jeremiah Burbank was the president of the Dorcas
Society and she remarked privately and publicly that if her ancestors
liked a smoky church they had a perfect right to the enjoyment of it
but that she did nt intend to sit through meeting on winter Sundays
with her white ostrich feather turning gray and her eyes smarting and
watering for the rest of her natural life

Whereupon this being in a business session she then and there proposed
to her already hypnotized constituents ways of earning enough money to
build a new chimney on the other side of the church

An awestricken community witnessed this beneficent act of vandalism
and finding that no thunderbolts of retribution descended from
the skies greatly relished the change If one or two aged persons
complained that they could not sleep as sweetly during sermontime in
the now clear atmosphere of the church and that the parsons eye
was keener than before why that was a mere detail and could not
be avoided what was the loss of a little sleep compared with the
discoloration of Mrs Jere Burbanks white ostrich feather and the
smarting of Mrs Jere Burbanks eyes

A new furnace followed the new chimney in due course and as a sense of
comfort grew there was opportunity to notice the lack of beauty
Twice in sixty years had some welltodo summer parishioner painted the
interior of the church at his own expense but although the roof had
been many times reshingled it had always persisted in leaking so that
the ceiling and walls were disfigured by unsightly spots and stains and
streaks The question of shingling was tacitly felt to be outside the
feminine domain but as there were five women to one man in the church
membership the feminine domain was frequently obliged to extend its
limits into the hitherto unknown Matters of tarring and waterproofing
were discussed in and out of season and the very schoolchildren
imbibed knowledge concerning lapping overlapping and crosslapping
and first and second quality of cedar shingles Miss Lobelia Brewster
who had a rooted distrust of anything done by mere man created strife
by remarking that she could have stopped the leak in the belfry tower
with her red flannel petticoat better than the Milltown man with his
newfangled rubber sheeting and that the last shingling could have been
more thoroughly done by a female infant babe whereupon the person
criticized retorted that he wished Miss Lobelia Brewster had a few
infant babes to put on the job hed like to see em try Meantime
several male members of the congregation who at one time or another had
sat on the roof during the hottest of the dogdays to see that shingling
operations were conscientiously and skillfully performed were very
pessimistic as to any satisfactory result ever being achieved

The angle of the roofwhat they call the pitchthey say that thats
always been wrong announced the secretary of the Dorcas in a business
session

Is it that kind of pitch that the Bible says you cant touch without
being defiled If not I vote that we unshingle the roof and alter the
pitch This proposal came from a sister named Maria Sharp who had
valiantly offered the year before to move the smoky chimney with her own
hands if the menfolks would nt

But though the incendiary suggestion of altering the pitch was received
with applause at the moment subsequent study of the situation proved
that such a proceeding was entirely beyond the modest means of the
society Then there arose an ingenious and militant carpenter in
a neighboring village who asserted that he would shingle the
meetinghouse roof for such and such a sum and agree to drink every
drop of water that would leak in afterward This was felt by all parties
to be a promise attended by extraordinary risks but it was accepted
nevertheless Miss Lobelia Brewster remarking that the rash carpenter
being already married could not marry a Dorcas anyway and even if he
died he was not a resident of Edgewood and therefore could be more
easily spared and that it would be rather exciting just for a change
to see a man drink himself to death with rainwater The expected
tragedy never occurred however and the inspired shingler fulfilled
his promise to the letter so that before many months the Dorcas
Society proceeded with incredible exertion to earn more money and the
interior of the church was neatly painted and made as fresh as a rose
With no smoke no rain no snow nor melting ice to defile it the good
old landmark that had been pointing its finger Heavenward for over a
century would now be clean and fragrant for years to come and the weary
sisters leaned back in their respective rockingchairs and drew deep
breaths of satisfaction

These breaths continued to be drawn throughout an unusually arduous
haying season until in fact a visitor from a neighboring city was
heard to remark that the Tory Hill MeetingHouse would be one of the
best preserved and pleasantest churches in the whole State of Maine if
only it were suitably carpeted

This thought had secretly occurred to many a Dorcas in her hours
of piemaking preserving or cradlerocking but had been promptly
extinguished as flagrantly extravagant and altogether impossible Now
that it had been openly mentioned the contagion of the idea spread and
in a month every sort of honest machinery for the increase of funds had
been set in motion harvest suppers pie sociables old folks concerts
apron sales and as a last resort a subscription paper for the
church floor measured hundreds of square yards and the carpet committee
announced that a good ingrain could not be purchased even with the
church discount for less than ninetyseven cents a yard

The Dorcases took out their pencils and when they multiplied the
surface of the floor by the price of the carpet per yard each Dorcas
attaining a result entirely different from all the others there was a
shriek of dismay especially from the secretary who had included in her
mathematical operation certain figures in her possession representing
the cubical contents of the church and the offending pitch of the roof
thereby obtaining a product that would have dismayed a Croesus Time
sped and efforts increased but the Dorcases were at length obliged to
clip the wings of their desire and content themselves with carpeting
the pulpit and pulpit steps the choir and the two aisles leaving the
floor in the pews until some future year

How the women cut and contrived and matched that hardlybought red
ingrain carpet in the short December afternoons that ensued after its
purchase so that having failed to be ready for Thanksgiving it could
be finished for the Christmas festivities

They were sewing in the church and as the last stitches were being
taken Maria Sharp suddenly ejaculated in her impulsive fashion

Would nt it have been just perfect if we could have had the pews
repainted before we laid the new carpet

It would indeed the president answered but it will take us all
winter to pay for the present improvements without any thought of fresh
paint If only we had a few more menfolks to help along

Or else none at all was Lobelia Brewsters suggestion Its havin
so few that keeps us all stirred up If there want any anywheres
wed have women deacons and carpenters and painters and get along first
rate for somehow the supply o women always holds out same as it does
with caterpillars an flies an grasshoppers

Everybody laughed although Maria Sharp asserted that she for one was
not willing to be called a caterpillar simply because there were too
many women in the universe

I never noticed before how shabby and scarred and dirty the pews are
said the ministers wife as she looked at them reflectively

Ive been thinking all the afternoon of the story about the poor old
woman and the lily and Nancy Wentworths clear voice broke into the
discussion Do you remember some one gave her a stalk of Easter lilies
and she set them in a glass pitcher on the kitchen table After looking
at them for a few minutes she got up from her chair and washed the
pitcher until the glass shone Sitting down again she glanced at
the little window It would never do she had forgotten how dusty and
blurred it was and she took her cloth and burnished the panes Then she
scoured the table then the floor then blackened the stove before she
sat down to her knitting And of course the lily had done it all just
by showing in its whiteness how grimy everything else was

The ministers wife who had been in Edgewood only a few months looked
admiringly at Nancys bright face wondering that fiveandthirty years
of life including ten of schoolteaching had done so little to mar its
serenity

The lily story is as true as the gospel she exclaimed and I can see
how one thing has led you to another in making the church comfortable
But my husband says that two coats of paint on the pews would cost a
considerable sum

How about cleaning them I dont believe theyve had a good hard
washing since the flood The suggestion came from Deacon Millers wife
to the president

They cant even be scrubbed for less than fifteen or twenty dollars
for I thought of that and asked Mrs Simpson yesterday and she said
twenty cents a pew was the cheapest she could do it for

Weve done everything else said Nancy Wentworth with a twitch of her
thread why dont we scrub the pews Theres nothing in the Orthodox
creed to forbid is there

Speakin o creeds and here old Mrs Sargent paused in her work
Elder Ransom from Acreville stopped with us last night an he tells
me they recite the Euthanasian Creed every few Sundays in the Episcopal
Church I did nt want him to know how ignorant I was but I looked up
the word in the dictionary It means easy death and I cant see any
sense in that though its a terrible long creed the Elder says an
if its any longer n ourn I should think anybody _might_ easy die
learnin it

I think the word is Athanasian ventured the ministers wife

Elder Ransoms always plumb full o doctrine asserted Miss Brewster
pursuing the subject For my part Im glad he preferred Acreville to
our place He was so busy bein a minister he never got round to bein
a human creeter When he used to come to sociables and picnics always
lookin kind o like the potato blight I used to think how complete
hed be if he had a foldin pulpit under his coattails they make
foldin beds nowadays an I spose they could make foldin pulpits if
there was a call

Land sakes I hope there wont be exclaimed Mrs Sargent An
the Elder never said much of anything either though he was always
preachin Now your husband Mis Baxter always has plenty to say after
you think hes all through Theres water in his well when the others is
all dry

But how about the pews interrupted Mrs Burbank I think Nancys
idea is splendid and I want to see it carried out We might make it a
picnic bring our luncheons and work all together let every woman in
the congregation come and scrub her own pew

Some are too old others live at too great a distance and the
ministers wife sighed a little indeed most of those who once owned
the pews or sat in them seem to be dead or gone away to live in busier
places

Ive no patience with em gallivantin over the earth and here
Lobelia rose and shook the carpet threads from her lap I should nt
want to live in a livelier place than Edgewood seems though We wash
and hang out Mondays iron Tuesdays cook Wednesdays clean house and
mend Thursdays and Fridays bake Saturdays and go to meetin Sundays I
dont hardly see how they can do any moren that in Chicago

Never mind if we have lost members said the indomitable Mrs Burbank
The members we still have left must work all the harder Well each
clean our own pew then take a few of our neighbors and then hire Mrs
Simpson to do the wainscoting and floor Can we scrub Friday and lay the
carpet Saturday My husband and Deacon Miller can help us at the end of
the week All in favor manifest it by the usual sign Contraryminded
It is a vote

There never were any contraryminded when Mrs Jere Burbank was in the
chair Public sentiment in Edgewood was swayed by the Dorcas Society
but Mrs Burbank swayed the Dorcases themselves as the wind sways the
wheat




II The old meetinghouse wore an animated aspect when the eventful
Friday came a cold brilliant sparkling December day with good
sleighing and with energy in every breath that swept over the dazzling
snowfields The sexton had built a fire in the furnace on the way to
his morning worka fire so economically contrived that it would last
exactly the four or five necessary hours and not a second more At
eleven oclock all the pillars of the society had assembled having
finished their own household work and laid out on their respective
kitchen tables comfortable luncheons for the men of the family if they
were fortunate enough to number any among their luxuries Water was
heated upon oilstoves set about here and there and there was a brave
array of scrubbingbrushes cloths soap and even sand and soda for it
had been decided and manifestedbytheusualsignandnocontrary
mindedanditwasavote that the dirt was to come off whether the
paint came with it or not Each of the fifteen women present selected a
block of seats preferably one in which her own was situated and all
fell busily to work

There is nobody here to clean the rightwing pews said Nancy
Wentworth so I will take those for my share

Youre not making a very wise choice Nancy and the ministers wife
smiled as she spoke The infant class of the SundaySchool sits there
you know and I expect the paint has had extra wear and tear Families
dont seem to occupy those pews regularly nowadays

I can remember when every seat in the whole church was filled
wings an all mused Mrs Sargent wringing out her washcloth in a
reminiscent mood The one in front o you Nancy was always called the
deef pew in the old times and all the folks that was hard o hearin
used to congregate there

The next pew has nt been occupied since I came here said the
ministers wife

No answered Mrs Sargent glad of any opportunity to retail
neighborhood news Squire Beans folks have moved to Portland to
be with the married daughter Somebody has to stay with her and her
husband wont The Squire aint a strong man and hes most too old to
go to meetin now The youngest son just died in New York so I hear

What ailed him inquired Maria Sharp

I guess he was completely wore out takin care of his health returned
Mrs Sargent He had a splendid constitution from a boy but he was
always afraid it would nt last him The seat back o Squire Beans
is the old Peabody pewaint that the Peabody pew youre scrubbin
Nancy

I believe so Nancy answered never pausing in her labors Its so
long since anybody sat there its hard to remember

It is the Peabodys I know it because the aisle runs right up facin
it I can see old Deacon Peabody settin in this end same as if t was
yesterday

He had died before Jere and I came back here to live said Mrs
Burbank The first I remember Justin Peabody sat in the end seat
the sister that died next and in the corner against the wall Mrs
Peabody with a crape shawl and a palmleaf fan They were a handsome
family You used to sit with them sometimes Nancy Esther was great
friends with you

Yes she was Nancy replied lifting the tattered cushion from its
place and brushing it and I with her What is the use of scrubbing and
carpeting when there are only twenty pewcushions and six hassocks in
the whole church and most of them ragged How can I ever mend this

I should nt trouble myself to darn other peoples cushions This
unchristian sentiment came in Mrs Millers ringing tones from the rear
of the church

I dont know why argued Maria Sharp Im going to mend my Aunt
Achsas cushion and we havent spoken for years but hers is the next
pew to mine and Im going to have my part of the church look decent
even if she is too stingy to do her share Besides there are nt
any Peabodys left to do their own darning and Nancy was friends with
Esther

Yes its nothing more than right Nancy replied with a note of
relief in her voice considering Esther

Though he dont belong to the scrubbin sex there is one Peabody
alive as you know if you stop to think Maria for Justins alive and
livin out West somewheres At least hes as much alive as ever he was
he was as good as dead when he was twentyone but his mother was always
too softhearted to bury him

There was considerable laughter over this sally of the outspoken Mrs
Sargent whose keen wit was the delight of the neighborhood

I know hes alive and doing business in Detroit for I got his address
a week or ten days ago and wrote asking him if hed like to give a
couple of dollars toward repairing the old church

Everybody looked at Mrs Burbank with interest

Has nt he answered asked Maria Sharp Nancy Wentworth held her
breath turned her face to the wall and silently wiped the paint of the
wainscoting The blood that had rushed into her cheeks at Mrs Sargents
jeering reference to Justin Peabody still lingered there for any one who
ran to read but fortunately nobody ran they were too busy scrubbing

Not yet Folks dont hurry about answering when you ask them for a
contribution replied the president with a cynicism common to persons
who collect funds for charitable purposes George Wickham sent me
twentyfive cents from Denver When I wrote him a receipt I said thank
you same as Aunt Polly did when the neighbors brought her a piece of
beef Ever so much obleeged but dont forget me when you come to kill
a pigNow Mrs Baxter you shant clean James Bruces pew or what
was his before he turned Second Advent Ill do that myself for he used
to be in my SundaySchool class

Hes the backbone o that congregation now asserted Mrs Sargent
and they say hes goin to marry Mrs Sam Peters who sings in their
choir as soon as his year is up They make a perfect fool of him in
that church

You cant make a fool of a man that nature aint begun with argued
Miss Brewster Jim Bruce never was very strongminded but I declare it
seems to me that when men lose their wives they lose their wits I
was sure Jim would marry Hannah Thompson that keeps house for him I
suspected she was lookin out for a life job when she hired out with
him

Hannah Thompson may keep Jims house but shell never keep Jim thats
certain affirmed the president and I cant see that Mrs Peters will
better herself much

I dont blame her for one came in no uncertain tones from the
leftwing pews and the Widow Buzzell rose from her knees and approached
the group by the pulpit If theres anything duller than cookin three
meals a day for yourself and settin down and eatin em by yourself
and then gettin up and clearin em away after yourself Id like to
know it I should nt want any goodlookin pleasantspoken man to
offer himself to me without he expected to be snapped up thats all
But if youve made out to get one husband in York County you can thank
the Lord and not expect any more favors I used to think Tom was poor
compny and complain I could nt have any conversation with him but
land I could talk at him and theres considerable comfort in that
And I could pick up after him Now every room in my house is clean and
every closet and bureau drawer too I cant start drawin in another
rug for Ive got all the rugs I can step foot on I dried so many
apples last year I shant need to cut up any this season My jelly and
preserves aint out and there I am and there most of us are in this
village without a man to take steps for and trot round after Theres
just three husbands among the fifteen women scrubbin here now and the
rest of us is all old maids and widders No wonder the menfolks die or
move away like Justin Peabody a place with such a mess o womenfolks
aint healthy to live in whatever Lobelia Brewster may say




III Justin Peabody had once faithfully struggled with the practical
difficulties of life in Edgewood or so he had thought in those old
days of which Nancy Wentworth was thinking when she wiped the paint
of the Peabody pew Work in the mills did not attract him he had no
capital to invest in a stock of goods for storekeeping schoolteaching
offered him only a pittance there remained then only the farm if he
were to stay at home and keep his mother company

Justin dont seem to take no holt of things said the neighbors

Good Heavens It seemed to him that there were no things to take hold
of That was his first thought later he grew to think that the trouble
all lay in himself and both thoughts bred weakness

The farm had somehow supported the family in the old Deacons time but
Justin seemed unable to coax a competence from the soil He could and
did rise early and work late till the earth sow crops but he could
not make the rain fall nor the sun shine at the times he needed them
and the elements however much they might seem to favor his neighbors
seldom smiled on his enterprises The crows liked Justins corn better
than any other in Edgewood It had a richness peculiar to itself a
quality that appealed to the most jaded palate so that it was really
worth while to fly over a mile of intervening fields and pay it the
delicate compliment of preference

Justin could explain the attitude of caterpillars worms grasshoppers
and potatobugs toward him only by assuming that he attracted them as
the magnet in the toy boxes attracts the miniature fishes

Land o liberty look at em congregate ejaculated Jabe Slocum when
he was called in for consultation Now if youd gone in for breedin
insecks you could be as proud as Cuffy an exhibit em at the County
Fair Theyd give yer prizes for size an numbers an speed I guess
Why say theyre real crowded for roomthe plants aint give em
enough leaves to roost on Have you tried Bug Death

It acts like a tonic on them said Justin gloomily

Sho you dont say so Now mine cant abide the sight nor smell of it
What bout Paris green

They thrive on it its as good as an appetizer

Well said Jabe Slocum revolving the quid of tobacco in his mouth
reflectively the bug that aint got no objection to pison is a bug
thats got ways o thinkin an feelin an reasonin that I aint able
to cope with Praps its all a leadin o Providence Mebbe it shows
youd ought to quit farmin crops an take to raisin live stock

Justin did just that as a matter of fact a year or two later but
stock that has within itself the power of being live has also rare
qualification for being dead when occasion suits and it generally
did suit Justins stock It proved prone not only to all the general
diseases that cattleflesh is heir to but was capable even of suicide
At least it is true that two valuable Jersey calves tied to stakes on
the hillside had flung themselves violently down the bank and strangled
themselves with their own ropes in a manner which seemed to show that
they found no pleasure in existence at all events on the Peabody farm

These were some of the little tragedies that had sickened young Justin
Peabody with life in Edgewood and Nancy Wentworth even then realized
some of them and sympathized without speaking in a girls poor
helpless way

Mrs Simpson had washed the floor in the right wing of the church and
Nancy had cleaned all the paint Now she sat in the old Peabody pew
darning the forlorn faded cushion with gray carpetthread thread as
gray as her own life

The scrubbingparty had moved to its labors in a far corner of the
church and two of the women were beginning preparations for the basket
luncheons Nancys needle was no busier than her memory Long years ago
she had often sat in the Peabody pew sometimes at first as a girl of
sixteen when asked by Esther and then on coming home from school at
eighteen finished she had been invited now and again by Mrs Peabody
herself on those Sundays when her own invalid mother had not attended
service

Those were wonderful SundaysSundays of quiet trembling peace and
maiden joy

Justin sat beside her and she had been sure then but had long since
grown to doubt the evidence of her senses that he too vibrated with
pleasure at the nearness Was there not a summer morning when his hand
touched her white lace mitt as they held the hymnbook together and the
lines of the

 Rise my soul and stretch thy wings
 Thy better portion trace

became blurred on the page and melted into something indistinguishable
for a full minute or two afterward Were there not looks and looks
and looks Or had she some misleading trick of vision in those days
Justins dark handsome profile rose before her the level brows and
fine lashes the wellcut nose and lovable mouththe Peabody mouth and
chin somewhat too sweet and pliant for strength perhaps Then the eyes
turned to hers in the old way just for a fleeting glance as they had
so often done at prayermeeting or sociable or Sunday service Was
it not a mans heart she had seen in them And oh if she could only be
sure that her own womans heart had not looked out from hers drawn from
its maiden shelter in spite of all her wish to keep it hidden

Then followed two dreary years of indecision and suspense when Justins
eyes met hers less freely when his looks were always gloomy and
anxious when affairs at the Peabody farm grew worse and worse when his
mother followed her husband the old Deacon and her daughter Esther to
the buryingground in the churchyard Then the end of all things came
the end of the world for Nancy Justins departure for the West in a
very frenzy of discouragement over the narrowness and limitation and
injustice of his lot over the rockiness and barrenness and unkindness
of the New England soil over the general bitterness of fate and the
bludgeonings of chance

He was a failure born of a family of failures If the world owed him a
living he had yet to find the method by which it could be earned All
this he thought and uttered and much more of the same sort In these
days of humbled pride self was paramount though it was a self he
despised There was no time for love Who was he for a girl to lean
uponhe who could not stand erect himself

He bade a stiff goodbye to his neighbors and to Nancy he vouchsafed
little more A handshake with no thrill of love in it such as might
have furnished her palm at least some memories to dwell upon a few
stilted words of leavetaking a halting meaningless sentence or
two about his botch of lifethen he walked away from the Wentworth
doorstep But halfway down the garden path where the shriveled
hollyhocks stood like sentinels did a wave of something different sweep
over hima wave of the boyish irresponsible past when his heart had
wings and could fly without fear to its matea wave of the past
that was rushing through Nancys mind wellnigh burying her in its
bittersweet waters For he lifted his head and suddenly retracing his
steps he came toward her and taking her hand again said forlornly
You ll see me back when my luck turns Nancy

Nancy knew that the words might mean little or much according to the
manner in which they were uttered but to her hurt pride and sore
shamed womaninstinct they were a promise simply because there was a
choking sound in Justins voice and tears in Justins eyes You ll see
me back when my luck turns Nancy this was the phrase upon which she
had lived for more than ten years Nancy had once heard the old parson
say ages ago that the whole purpose of life was the growth of the
soul that we eat sleep clothe ourselves work love all to give the
soul another day month year in which to develop She used to wonder
if her soul could be growing in the monotonous round of her dull duties
and her duller pleasures She did not confess it even to herself
nevertheless she knew that she worked ate slept to live until
Justins luck turned Her love had lain in her heart a bird without
a song year after year Her mother had dwelt by her side and never
guessed her father too and both were dead The neighbors also
lynxeyed and curious had never suspected If she had suffered no one
in Edgewood was any the wiser for the maiden heart is not commonly worn
on the sleeve in New England If she had been openly pledged to Justin
Peabody she could have waited twice ten years with a decent show of
selfrespect for long engagements were viewed rather as a matter of
course in that neighborhood The endless months had gone on since that
gray November day when Justin had said goodbye It had been just before
Thanksgiving and she went to church with an aching and ungrateful
heart The parson read from the eighth chapter of St Matthew a most
unexpected selection for that holiday If you cant find anything else
to be thankful for he cried go home and be thankful you are not a
leper

Nancy took the drastic counsel away from the church with her and it
was many a year before she could manage to add to this slender store
anything to increase her gratitude for mercies given though all the
time she was outwardly busy cheerful and helpful

Justin had once come back to Edgewood and it was the bitterest drop
in her cup of bitterness that she was spending that winter in Berwick
where so the neighbors told him she was a great favorite in society
and was receiving much attention from gentlemen so that she had never
heard of his visit until the spring had come again Parted friends
did not keep up with one anothers affairs by means of epistolary
communication in those days in Edgewood it was not the custom Spoken
words were difficult enough to Justin Peabody and written words were
quite impossible especially if they were to be used to define his
halfconscious desires and his fluctuations of will or to recount his
disappointments and discouragements and mistakes




IV It was Saturday afternoon the 24th of December and the weary
sisters of the Dorcas band rose from their bruised knees and removed
their little stores of carpettacks from their mouths This was a
feminine custom of long standing and as no village dressmaker had
ever died of pins in the digestive organs so were no symptoms of
carpettacks ever discovered in any Dorcas living or dead Men wondered
at the habit and reviled it but stood confounded in the presence of its
indubitable harmlessness

The red ingrain carpet was indeed very warm beautiful and comforting
to the eye and the sisters were suitably grateful to Providence and
devoutly thankful to themselves that they had been enabled to buy
sew and lay so many yards of it But as they stood looking at their
completed task it was cruelly true that there was much left to do

The aisles had been painted dark brown on each side of the red strips
leading from the doors to the pulpit but the rest of the church floor
was a thing of shreds and patches Each member of the carpet committee
had paid as a matter of pride however ill she could afford it three
dollars and sixtyseven cents for sufficient carpet to lay in her own
pew but these brilliant spots of conscientious effort only made the
stretches of bare unpainted floor more evident And that was not all
Traces of former spasmodic and individual efforts desecrated the
present ideals The doctors pew had a pinkandblue Brussels on it the
lawyers striped staircarpeting the Browns from Deerwander sported
straw matting and were not abashed while the Greens the Whites the
Blacks and the Grays displayed floor coverings as dissimilar as their
names

I never noticed it before exclaimed Maria Sharp but it aint
Christian that floor its heathenish and ungodly

For mercys sake dont swear Maria said Mrs Miller nervously
Weve done our best and lets hope that folks will look up and not
down It is nt as if they were going to set in the chandelier theyll
have something else to think about when Nancy gets her hemlock branches
and white carnations in the pulpit vases This morning my Abner picked
off two pinks from a plant Ive been nursing in my diningroom for
weeks trying to make it bloom for Christmas I slapped his hands good
and its been haunting me ever since to think I had to correct him the
day before ChristmasCome Lobelia we must be hurrying

One thing comforts me exclaimed the Widow Buzzell as she took her
hammer and tacks preparatory to leaving and that is that the Methodist
meetinhouse aint got any carpet at all

Mrs Buzzell Mrs Buzzell interrupted the ministers wife with a
smile that took the sting from her speech It will be like punishing
little Abner Miller if we think those thoughts on Christmas Eve we
shall surely be haunted afterward

And anyway interjected Maria Sharp who always saved the situation
you just wait and see if the Methodists dont say theyd rather have
no carpet at all than have one that dont go all over the floor I know
em and she put on her hood and blanketshawl as she gave one last
fond look at the improvements

Im going home to get my supper and come back afterward to lay the
carpet in my pew my beans and brown bread will be just right by now
and perhaps it will rest me a little besides I must feed Zekiel

As Nancy Wentworth spoke she sat in a corner of her own modest rear
seat looking a little pale and tired Her waving dark hair had
loosened and fallen over her cheeks and her eyes gleamed from under it
wistfully Nowadays Nancys eyes never had the sparkle of gazing into
the future but always the liquid softness that comes from looking
backward

The church will be real cold by then Nancy objected Mrs
BurbankGoodnight Mrs Baxter

Oh no I shall be back by halfpast six and I shall not work long
Do you know what I believe Ill do Mrs Burbank just through the
holidays Christmas and New Years both coming on Sunday this year
therell be a great many out to church not counting the strangers
thatll come to the special service tomorrow Instead of putting down my
own pew carpet thatll never be noticed here in the back Ill lay it
in the old Peabody pew for the red aislestrip leads straight up to it
the ministers always go up that side and it does look forlorn

Thats so And all the more because my pew thats exactly opposite in
the left wing is new carpeted and cushioned replied the president
I think its real generous of you Nancy because the Riverboro folks
knowing that youre a member of the carpet committee will be sure to
notice and think its queer you have nt made an effort to carpet your
own pew

Never mind smiled Nancy wearily Riverboro folks never go to bed on
Saturday nights without wondering what Edgewood is thinking about them

The ministers wife stood at her window watching Nancy as she passed the
parsonage

How wasted How wasted she sighed Going home to eat her lonely
supper and feed Zekiel I can bear it for the others but not for
Nancy Now she has lighted her lamp now she has put fresh pine
on the fire for new smoke comes from the chimney Why should I sit down
and serve my dear husband and Nancy feed Zekiel

There was some truth in Mrs Baxters feeling Mrs Buzzell for
instance had three sons Maria Sharp was absorbed in her lame father
and her SundaySchool work and Lobelia Brewster would not have
considered matrimony a blessing even under the most favorable
conditions But Nancy was framed and planned for other things and
Zekiel was an insufficient channel for her soft womanly sympathy and
her bright activity of mind and body

Zekiel had lost his tail in a mowingmachine Zekiel had the asthma
and the immersion of his nose in milk made him sneeze so he was wont
to slip his paw in and out of the dish and lick it patiently for five
minutes together Nancy often watched him pityingly giving him kind
and gentle words to sustain his fainting spirit but tonight she paid no
heed to him although he sneezed violently to attract her attention

She had put her supper on the lighted table by the kitchen window and
was pouring out her cup of tea when a boy rapped at the door Heres
a paper and a letter Miss Wentworth he said Its the second this
week and they think over to the store that that Berwick widower must be
settin up and takin notice

She had indeed received a letter the day before an unsigned
communication consisting only of the words

 Second Epistle of John Verse x2

She had taken her Bible to look out the reference and found it to be

 Having many tilings to write unto you I would not write
 with paper and ink but I trust to come unto you and speak
 face to face that our joy may be full

The envelope was postmarked New York and she smiled thinking that Mrs
Emerson a charming lady who had spent the summer in Edgewood and
had sung with her in the village choir was coming back as she had
promised to have a sleigh ride and see Edgewood in its winter dress
Nancy had almost forgotten the first letter in the excitements of her
busy day and now here was another from Boston this time She opened
the envelope and found again only a simple sentence printed not
written Lest she should guess the hand she wondered

 Second Epistle of John Verse 5
 And now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment
 unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one
 another

Was it Mrs Emerson Could it beany one else Was it No it might
have been years ago but not now not nowAnd yet he was always so
different from other people and once in church he had handed her the
hymnbook with his finger pointing to a certain verse

She always fancied that her secret fidelity of heart rose from the
fact that Justin Peabody was different From the hour of their first
acquaintance she was ever comparing him with his companions and always
to his advantage So long as a woman finds all men very much alike as
Lobelia Brewster did save that she allowed some to be worse she is
in no danger But the moment in which she perceives and discriminates
subtle differences marveling that there can be two opinions about a
mans superiority that moment the miracle has happened

 And now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment
 unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one
 another

No it could not be from Justin She drank her tea played with her
beans abstractedly and nibbled her slice of steaming brown bread

 Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee

No not a new one twelve fifteen years old that commandment

 That we love one another

Who was speaking Who had written these words The first letter sounded
just like Mrs Emerson who had said she was a very poor correspondent
but that she should just drop down on Nancy one of these days but
this second letter never came from Mrs EmersonWell there would be
an explanation some time a pleasant one one to smile over and tell
Zekiel and repeat to the neighbors but not an unexpected sacred
beautiful explanation such a one as the heart of a woman could imagine
if she were young enough and happy enough to hope She washed her cup
and plate replaced the uneaten beans in the brown pot and put them
away with the round loaf folded the cloth Lobelia Brewster said
Nancy always set out her meals as if she was entertainin company from
Portland closed the stove dampers carried the lighted lamp to a
safe corner shelf and lifted Zekiel to his cushion on the highbacked
rocker doing all with the nice precision of long habit Then she
wrapped herself warmly and locking the lonely little house behind her
set out to finish her work in the church




V At this precise moment Justin Peabody was eating his own beans
and brown bread articles of diet of which his Detroit landlady was
lamentably ignorant at the new tavern not far from the meetinghouse

It would not be fair to him to say that Mrs Burbanks letter had
brought him back to Edgewood but it had certainly accelerated his
steps

For the first six years after Justin Peabody left home he had drifted
about from place to place saving every possible dollar of his uncertain
earnings in the conscious hope that he could go back to New England
and ask Nancy Wentworth to marry him The West was prosperous and
progressive but how he yearned in idle moments for the grimmer and
more sterile soil that had given him birth

Then came what seemed to him a brilliant chance for a lucky turn of his
savings and he invested them in an enterprise which wonderfully as
it promised failed within six months and left him penniless At that
moment he definitely gave up all hope and for the next few years he put
Nancy as far as possible out of his mind in the full belief that he was
acting an honorable part in refusing to drag her into his tangled and
fruitless way of life If she ever did care for himand he could not
be sure she was always so shyshe must have outgrown the feeling long
since and be living happily or at least contentedly in her own
way He was glad in spite of himself when he heard that she had never
married but at least he had nt it on his conscience that _he_ had kept
her single

On the 17th of December Justin his business day over was walking
toward the dreary house in which he ate and slept As he turned the
corner he heard one woman say to another as they watched a man
stumbling sorrowfully down the street Going home will be the worst of
all for himto find nobody there That was what going home had meant
for him these ten years but he afterward felt it strange that this
thought should have struck him so forcibly on that particular day
Entering the boardinghouse he found Mrs Burbanks letter with its
Edgewood postmark on the hall table and took it up to his room He
kindled a little fire in the airtight stove watching the flame creep
from shavings to kindlings from kindlings to small pine and from small
pine to the round hardwood sticks then when the result seemed certain
he closed the stove door and sat down to read the letter Whereupon all
manner of strange things happened in his head and heart and flesh and
spirit as he sat there alone his hands in his pockets his feet braced
against the legs of the stove

It was a cold winter night and the snow and sleet beat against the
windows He looked about the ugly room at the washstand with its square
of oilcloth in front and its detestable bowl and pitcher at the rigors
of his white iron bedstead with the valley in the middle of the
lumpy mattress and the darns in the rumpled pillowcases at the dull
photographs of the landladys hideous husband and children enshrined on
the mantelshelf looked at the abomination of desolation surrounding him
until his soul sickened and cried out like a childs for something more
like home It was as if a spring thaw had melted his icebound heart
and on the crest of a wave it was drifting out into the milder waters of
some unknown sea He could have laid his head in the kind lap of a woman
and cried Comfort me Give me companionship or I die

The wind howled in the chimney and rattled the loose windowsashes the
snow freezing as it fell dashed against the glass with hard cutting
little blows at least that is the way in which the wind and snow
flattered themselves they were making existence disagreeable to Justin
Peabody when he read the letter but never were elements more mistaken

It was a June Sunday in the boardinghouse bedroom and for that matter
it was not the boardinghouse bedroom at all it was the old Orthodox
church on Tory Hill in Edgewood The windows were wide open and the
smell of the purple clover and the humming of the bees were drifting
into the sweet wide spaces within Justin was sitting in the end of the
Peabody pew and Nancy Wentworth was beside him Nancy cool and restful
in her white dress darkhaired Nancy under the shadow of her shirred
muslin hat

 Rise my soul and stretch thy wings
 Thy better portion trace

The melodeon gave the tune and Nancy and he stood to sing taking the
book between them His hand touched hers and as the music of the hymn
rose and fell the future unrolled itself before his eyes a future in
which Nancy was his wedded wife and the happy years stretched on and
on in front of them until there was a row of little heads in the old
Peabody pew and mother and father could look proudly along the line at
the young things they were bringing into the house of the Lord

The recalling of that vision worked like magic in Justins blood
His soul rose and stretched its wings and traced its better portion
vividly as he sprang to his feet and walked up and down the bedroom
floor He would get a few days leave and go back to Edgewood for
Christmas to join with all the old neighbors in the service at the
meetinghouse and in pursuance of this resolve he shook his fist in
the face of the landladys husband on the mantelpiece and dared him to
prevent

He had a salary of fifty dollars a month with some very slight prospect
of an increase after January He did not see how two persons could eat
and drink and lodge and dress on it in Detroit but he proposed
to give Nancy Wentworth the refusal of that magnificent future that
brilliant and tempting offer He had exactly one hundred dollars in
the bank and sixty or seventy of them would be spent in the journeys
counting two happy blessed fares back from Edgewood to Detroit and if
he paid only his own fare back he would throw the price of the other
into the pond behind the Wentworth house He would drop another ten
dollars into the plate on Christmas Day toward the repairs on the
church if he starved he would do that He was a failure Everything
his hand touched turned to naught He looked himself full in the face
recognizing his weakness and in this supremest moment of recognition
he was a stronger man than he had been an hour before His drooping
shoulders had straightened the restless look had gone from his eyes
his somber face had something of repose in it the repose of a settled
purpose He was a failure but perhaps if he took the risks and
if Nancy would take thembut that was the trouble women were so
unselfish they were always willing to take risks and one ought not to
let them perhaps he might do better in trying to make a living for
two than he had in working for himself alone He would go home tell
Nancy that he was an unlucky goodfornaught and ask her if she would
try her hand at making him over




VI These were the reasons that had brought Justin Peabody to Edgewood
on the Saturday afternoon before Christmas and had taken him to the new
tavern on Tory Hill near the meetinghouse

Nobody recognized him at the station or noticed him at the tavern and
after his supper he put on his overcoat and started out for a walk
aimlessly hoping that he might meet a friend or failing that intending
to call on some of his old neighbors with the view of hearing the
village news and securing some information which might help him to
decide when he had better lay himself and his misfortunes at Nancy
Wentworths feet They were pretty feet He remembered that fact well
enough under the magical influence of familiar sights and sounds and
odors He was restless miserable anxious homesicknot for Detroit
but for some heretofore unimagined good yet like Bunyans shepherd boy
in the Valley of humiliation he carried the herb called Heartsease in
his bosom for he was at last loving consciously

How white the old church looked and how green the blinds It must
have been painted very lately that meant that the parish was fairly
prosperous There were new shutters in the belfry tower too he
remembered the former open space and the rusty bell and he liked the
change Did the chimney use to be in that corner No but his father had
always said it would have drawn better if it had been put there in the
beginning New shingles within a year that was evident to a practiced
eye He wondered if anything had been done to the inside of the
building but he must wait until the morrow to see for of course the
doors would be locked No the one at the right side was ajar He opened
it softly and stepped into the tiny square entry that he recalled so
wellthe one through which the SundaySchool children ran out to the
steps from their catechism apparently enjoying the sunshine after a
spell of orthodoxy the little entry where the village girls congregated
while waiting for the last bell to ringthey made a soft blur of pink
and blue and buff a little flutter of curls and braids and fans and
sunshades in his minds eye as he closed the outer door behind him
and gently opened the inner one The church was flooded with moonlight
and snowlight and there was one lamp burning at the back of the pulpit
a candle too on the pulpit steps There was the tiptaptip of a
tackhammer going on in a distant corner Was somebody hanging Christmas
garlands The new red carpet attracted his notice and as he grew
accustomed to the dim light it carried his eye along the aisle he had
trod so many years of Sundays to the old familiar pew The sound of the
hammer ceased and a woman rose from her knees A stranger was doing for
the family honor what he ought himself to have done The woman turned
to shake her skirt and it was Nancy Wentworth He might have known it
Women were always faithful they always remembered old landmarks old
days old friends old duties His father and mother and Esther were all
gone who but dear Nancy would have made the old Peabody pew right and
tidy for the Christmas festival Bless her kind womanly heart

She looked just the same to him as when he last saw her Mercifully
he seemed to have held in remembrance all these years not so much
her youthful bloom as her general qualities of mind and heart her
cheeriness her spirit her unflagging zeal her bright womanliness Her
gray dress was turned up in front over a crimson moreen petticoat She
had on a cozy jacket a fur turban of some sort with a red breast in it
and her cheeks were flushed from exertion Sweet records and promises
as sweet had always met in Nancys face and either he had forgotten
how pretty she was or else she had absolutely grown prettier during his
absence

Nancy would have chosen the supreme moment of meeting very differently
but she might well have chosen worse She unpinned her skirt and brushed
the threads off smoothed the pew cushions carefully and took a
last stitch in the ragged hassock She then lifted the Bible and the
hymnbook from the rack and putting down a bit of flannel on the pulpit
steps took a flatiron from an oilstove and opening the ancient books
pressed out the wellthumbed leaves one by one with infinite care After
replacing the volumes in their accustomed place she first extinguished
the flame of her stove which she tucked out of sight and then blew out
the lamp and the candle The church was still light enough for objects
to be seen in a shadowy way like the objects in a dream and Justin did
not realize that he was a man in the flesh looking at a woman spying
it might be upon her privacy He was one part of a dream and she
another and he stood as if waiting and fearing to be awakened

Nancy having done all came out of the pew and standing in the aisle
looked back at the scene of her labors with pride and content And as
she looked some desire to stay a little longer in the dear old place
must have come over her or some dread of going back to her lonely
cottage for she sat down in Justins corner of the pew with folded
hands her eyes fixed dreamily on the pulpit and her ears hearing

 Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that
 which we had from the beginning

Justins grasp on the latch tightened as he prepared to close the door
and leave the place but his instinct did not warn him quickly enough
after all for obeying some uncontrollable impulse Nancy suddenly fell
on her knees in the pew and buried her face in the cushions The dream
broke and in an instant Justin was a manworse than that he was
an eavesdropper ashamed of his unsuspected presence He felt himself
standing with covered head and feet shod in the holy temple of a
womans heart

But his involuntary irreverence brought abundant grace with it
The glimpse and the revelation wrought their miracles silently and
irresistibly not by the slow processes of growth which Nature demands
for her enterprises but with the sudden swiftness of the spirit In
an instant changes had taken place in Justins soul which his socalled
experiencing religion twentyfive years back had been powerless to
effect He had indeed been baptized then but the recording angel could
have borne witness that this second baptism fructified the first and
became the real herald of the new birth and the new creature




VII Justin Peabody silently closed the inner door and stood in the
entry with his head bent and his heart in a whirl until he should hear
Nancy rise to her feet He must take this Heavensent chance of telling
her all but how do it without alarming her

A moment and her step sounded in the stillness of the empty church

Obeying the first impulse he passed through the outer door and
standing on the step knocked once twice three times then opening
it a little and speaking through the chink he called Is Miss Nancy
Wentworth here

Im here in a moment came Nancys answer and then with a little
wondering tremor in her voice as if a hint of the truth had already
dawned Whats wanted

Youre wanted Nancy wanted badly by Justin Peabody come back from
the West

The door opened wide and Justin faced Nancy standing halfway down
the aisle her eyes brilliant her lips parted A week ago Justins
apparition confronting her in the empty meetinghouse after nightfall
even had she been prepared for it as now by his voice would have
terrified her beyond measure Now it seemed almost natural and
inevitable She had spent these last days in the church where both of
them had been young and happy together the two letters had brought him
vividly to mind and her labor in the old Peabody pew had been one
long excursion into the past in which he was the most prominent and the
bestloved figure

I said Id come back to you when my luck turned Nancy

These were so precisely the words she expected him to say should she
ever see him again face to face that for an additional moment they but
heightened her sense of unreality

Well the luck hasnt turned after all but I could nt wait any
longer Have you given a thought to me all these years Nancy

More than one Justin For the very look upon his face the tenderness
of his voice the attitude of his body outran his words and told her
what he had come home to say told her that her years of waiting were
over at last

You ought to despise me for coming back again with only myself and my
empty hands to offer you

How easy it was to speak his heart out in this dim and quiet place How
tonguetied he would have been sitting on the black haircloth sofa in
the Wentworth parlor and gazing at the open soapstone stove

Oh men are such fools cried Nancy smiles and tears struggling
together in her speech as she sat down suddenly in her own pew and put
her hands over her face

They are agreed Justin humbly but Ive never stopped loving you
whenever Ive had time for thinking or loving And I was nt sure that
you really cared anything about me and how could I have asked you when
I had nt a dollar in the world

There are other things to give a woman besides dollars Justin

Are there Well you shall have them all every one of them Nancy if
you can make up your mind to do without the dollars for dollars seem to
be just what I cant manage

Her hand was in his by this time and they were sitting side by side
in the cushionless carpetless Wentworth pew The door stood open the
winter moon shone in upon them That it was beginning to grow cold in
the church passed unnoticed The grasp of the womans hand seemed
to give the man new hope and courage and Justins warm confiding
pleading pressure brought balm to Nancy balm and healing for the wounds
her pride had suffered joy too halfconscious still that her life
need not be lived to the end in unfruitful solitude She had waited
as some gray lake lies full and smooth awaiting the star below the
twilight

Justin Peabody might have been no other womans star but he was
Nancys Just you sitting beside me here makes me feel as if Id been
asleep or dead all these years and just born over again said
Justin Ive led a respectable hardworking honest life Nancy he
continued and I dont owe any man a cent the trouble is that no man
owes me one Ive got enough money to pay two fares back to Detroit on
Monday although I was terribly afraid you would nt let me do it Itll
need a good deal of thinking and planning Nancy for we shall be very
poor

Nancy had been storing up fidelity and affection deep deep in the hive
of her heart all these years and now the honey of her helpfulness stood
ready to be gathered

Could I keep hens in Detroit she asked I can always make them pay

Hensin three rooms Nancy

Her face fell And no yard

No yard

A moments pause and then the smile came Oh well Ive had yards and
hens for thirtyfive years Doing without them will be a change I can
take in sewing

No you cant Nancy I need your backbone and wits and pluck and
ingenuity but if I cant ask you to sit with your hands folded for the
rest of your life as Id like to you shant use them for other people
Youre marrying me to make a man of me but Im not marrying you to make
you a drudge

His voice rang clear and true in the silence and Nancys heart vibrated
at the sound

O Justin Justin theres something wrong somewhere she whispered
but well find it out together you and I and make it right Youre
not like a failure You dont even look poor Justin there is nt a man
in Edgewood to compare with you or I should be washing his dishes and
darning his stockings this minute And I am not a pauper Therell be
the rent of my little house and a carload of my furniture so you can
put the threeroom idea out of your mind and your firm will offer you a
larger salary when you tell them you have a wife to take care of Oh I
see it all and it is as easy and bright and happy as can be

Justin put his arm around her and drew her close with such a throb of
gratitude for her belief and trust that it moved him almost to tears
There was a long pause then he said

Now I shall call for you tomorrow morning after the last bell has
stopped ringing and we will walk up the aisle together and sit in the
old Peabody pew We shall be a nine days wonder anyway but this will
be equal to an announcement especially if you take my arm We dont
either of us like to be stared at but this will show without a word
what we think of each other and what weve promised to be to each other
and its the only thing that will make me feel sure of you and settled
in my mind after all these mistaken years Have you got the courage
Nancy

I should nt wonder I guess if Ive had courage enough to wait for
you Ive got courage enough to walk up the aisle with you and marry
you besides said NancyNow it is too late for us to stay here any
longer and you must see me only as far as my gate for perhaps you have
nt forgotten yet how interested the Brewsters are in their neighbors

They stood at the little Wentworth gate for a moment hand close clasped
in hand The night was clear the air was cold and sparkling but with
nothing of bitterness in it the sky was steely blue and the evening
star glowed and burned like a tiny sun Nancy remembered the shepherds
song she had taught the SundaySchool children and repeated softly

 For I my sheep was watching
 Beneath the silent skies
 When sudden far to eastward
 I saw a star arise
 Then all the peaceful heavens
 With sweetest music rang
 And glory glory glory
 The happy angels sang

 So I this night am joyful
 Though I can scarce tell why
 It seemeth me that glory
 Hath met us very nigh
 And we though poor and humble
 Have part in heavenly plan
 For born tonight the Prince of Peace
 Shall rule the heart of man

Justins heart melted within him like wax to the womans vision and the
womans touch

Oh Nancy Nancy he whispered If I had brought my bad luck to you
long long ago would you have taken me then and have I lost years of
such happiness as this

There are some things it is not best for a man to be certain about
said Nancy with a wise smile and a last goodnight



VIII Ring out sweet bells


 Ring out sweet bells
 Oer woods and dells
 Your lovely strains repeat
 While happy throngs
 With joyous songs
 Each accent gladly greet

Christmas morning in the old Tory Hill MeetingHouse was felt by all
of the persons who were present in that particular year to be a most
exciting and memorable occasion

The old sexton quite outdid himself for although he had rung the bell
for more than thirty years he had never felt greater pride or joy in
his task Was not his son John home for Christmas and Johns wife
and a grandchild newly named Nathaniel for himself Were there not
spareribs and turkeys and cranberries and mince pies on the pantry
shelves and barrels of rosy Baldwins in the cellar and bottles of
mothers root beer just waiting to give a holiday pop The bell itself
forgot its age and the suspicion of a crack that dulled its voice on
a damp day and inspired by the bright frosty air the sextons
inspiring pull and the Christmas spirit gave out nothing but joyous
tones

_Dingdong_ _Dingdong_ It fired the ambitions of star scholars about
to recite hymns and sing solos It thrilled little girls expecting dolls
before night It excited beyond bearing dozens of little boys being
buttoned into refractory overcoats _Dingdong_ _Dingdong_ Mothers
fingers trembled when they heard it and mothers voices cried If that
is the second bell the children will never be ready in time Where
are the overshoes Where are the mittens Hurry Jack Hurry Jennie
_Dingdong_ _Dingdong_ Wheres Sallys muff Wheres fathers fur
cap Is the sleigh at the door Are the hot soapstones in Have all of
you your money for the contribution box _Dingdong_ _Dingdong_ It
was a blithe bell a sweet true bell a holy bell and to Justin pacing
his tavern room as to Nancy trembling in her maiden chamber it rang a
Christmas message

 Awake glad heart Arise and sing
 It is the birthday of thy King

The congregation filled every seat in the old meetinghouse As Maria
Sharp had prophesied there was one illnatured spinster from a rival
village who declared that the church floor looked like Josephs coat
laid out smooth but in the general chorus of admiration approval and
goodwill this envious speech though repeated from mouth to mouth left
no sting

Another item of interest long recalled was the fact that on that august
and unapproachable day the pulpit vases stood erect and empty though
Nancy Wentworth had filled them every Sunday since any one could
remember This instance though felt at the time to be of mysterious
significance if the cause were ever revealed paled into nothingness
when after the ringing of the last bell Nancy Wentworth walked up the
aisle on Justin Peabodys arm and they took their seats side by side in
the old family pew

And considable close too though there was plenty o room

And no one that I ever heard of so much as suspicioned that they had
ever kept company

And do you spose she knew Justin was expected back when she scrubbed
his pew aFriday 

And this explains the empty pulpit vases 

And I always said that Nancy would make a real handsome couple if she
ever got anybody to couple with

During the unexpected and solemn procession of the two up the aisle
the soprano of the village choir stopped short in the middle of the
Doxology and the three other voices carried it to the end without any
treble Also among those present there were some who could not remember
afterward the precise petitions wafted upward in the opening prayer

And could it be explained otherwise than by cheerfully acknowledging the
bounty of an overruling Providence that Nancy Wentworth should have had
a new winter dress for the first time in five yearsa winter dress of
dark brown cloth to match her beaver muff and victorine The existence
of this toilette had been known and discussed in Edgewood for a month
past and it was thought to be nothing more than a proper token
of respect from a member of the carpet committee to the general
magnificence of the church on the occasion of its reopening after
repairs Indeed you could have identified every member of the Dorcas
Society that Sunday morning by the freshness of her apparel The brown
dress then was generally expected but why the white cashmere waist
with collar and cuffs of point lace devised only and suitable only for
the ministers wedding where it first saw the light

The white waist can only be explained as showing distinct hope
whispered the ministers wife during the reading of the church notices

To me it shows more than hope I am very sure that Nancy would never
take any wear out of that lace for hope it means certainty answered
Maria who was always strong in the prophetic line

Justins identity had dawned upon most of the congregation by sermon
time A stranger to all but one or two at first his presence in the
Peabody pew brought his face and figure back little by little to the
minds of the old parishioners

When the contribution plate was passed the sexton always began at the
rightwing pews as all the sextons before him had done for a hundred
years Every eye in the church was already turned upon Justin and
Nancy and it was with almost a gasp that those in the vicinity saw a
tendollar bill fall in the plate The sexton reeled or if that is too
intemperate a word for a pillar of the church the good man tottered
but caught hold of the pew rail with one hand and putting the thumb
of his other over the bill proceeded quickly to the next pew lest
the stranger should think better of his gift or demand change as had
occasionally been done in the olden time

Nancy never fluttered an eyelash but sat quietly by Justins side with
her bosom rising and falling under the beaver fur and her cold
hands clasped tight in the little brown muff Far from grudging this
appreciable part of their slender resources she thrilled with pride to
see Justins offering fall in the plate

Justin was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice anything but
his munificent contribution had a most unexpected effect upon his
reputation after all for on that day and on many another later one
when his sudden marriage and departure with Nancy Wentworth were under
discussion the neighbors said to one anotherJustin must be making
money fast out West He put ten dollars in the contribution plate
aSunday and paid the minister ten more next day for marryin him to
Nancy so the Peabody luck has turned at lastwhich as a matter of
fact it had

And all the time said the chairman of the carpet committee to the
treasurer of the Dorcas Societyall the time little as she realized
it Nancy was laying the carpet in her own pew Now shes married to
Justin shell be the makin of him or I miss my guess You cant do a
thing with menfolks without theyre right alongside where you can keep
your eye and hand on em Justins handsome and good and stiddy all he
needs is some nice woman to put starch into him The Edgewood Peabodys
never had a mite o stiffenin in emlimp as dishrags every blessed
one Nancy Wentworth fairly rustles with starch Justin had nt been
engaged to her but a few hours when they walked up the aisle together
but did you notice the way he carried his head I declare I thought t
would fall off behind I should nt wonder a mite but they prospered and
come back every summer to set in the Old Peabody Pew





SUSANNA AND SUE




I Mother Anns Children


It was the end of May when spring goeth all in white The apple trees
were scattering their delicate petals on the ground dropping them
over the stone walls to the roadsides where in the moist places of the
shadows they fell on beds of snowy innocence Here and there a single
tree was tinged with pink but so faintly it was as if the white were
blushing Now and then a tiny white butterfly danced in the sun and
pearly clouds strayed across the sky in fleecy flocks

Everywhere the grass was of ethereal greenness a greenness drenched
with the pale yellow of spring sunshine Looking from earth to sky
and from blossom to blossom the little world of the apple orchards
shedding its falling petals like fairweather snow seemed made of
alabaster and porcelain ivory and motherofpearl all shimmering on a
background of tender green

After you pass Albion village with its streets shaded by elms and
maples and its outskirts embowered in blossoming orchards you wind
along a hilly country road that runs between grassy fields Here the
whiteweed is already budding and there are pleasant pastures dotted
with rocks and fringed with spruce and fir stretches of woodland
too where the road is lined with giant pines and you lift your face
gratefully to catch the cool balsam breath of the forest Coming from
out this splendid shade this silence too deep to be disturbed by light
breezes or vagrant winds you find yourself on the brow of a descending
hill The first thing that strikes the eye is a lake that might be a
great blue sapphire dropped into the verdant hollow where it lies When
the eye reluctantly leaves the lake on the left it turns to rest
upon the little Shaker Settlement on the righta dozen or so large
comfortable white barns sheds and houses standing in the wide orderly
spaces of their own spreading acres of farm and timber land There
again the spring goeth all in white for there is no spot to fleck the
dazzling quality of Shaker paint and their apple plum and pear trees
are so well cared for that the snowy blossoms are fairly hiding the
branches

The place is very still although there are signs of labor in all
directions From a window of the girls building a quaint little
grayclad figure is beating a braided rug a boy in homespun with his
hair slightly long in the back and cut in a straight line across the
forehead is carrying milkcans from the dairy to one of the Sisters
Houses Men in broadbrimmed hats with cleanshaven ascetic faces are
ploughing or harrowing here and there in the fields while a group of
Sisters is busy setting out plants and vines in some beds near a cluster
of noble trees That cluster of trees did the eye of the stranger
realize it was the very startingpoint of this Shaker Community for
in the year 1785 the valiant Father James Whittaker one of Mother Ann
Lees earliest English converts stopped near the village of Albion
on his first visit to Maine As he and his Elders alighted from their
horses they stuck into the ground the willow withes they had used as
whips and now a hundred years later the trees that had grown from
these slender branches were nearly three feet in diameter

From whatever angle you look upon the Settlement the first and
strongest impression is of quiet order harmony and a kind of austere
plenty Nowhere is the purity of the spring so apparent Nothing is
out of place nowhere is any confusion or appearance of loose ends or
neglected tasks As you come nearer you feel the more surely that here
there has never been undue haste nor waste no shirking no putting off
till the morrow what should have been done today Whenever a shingle or
a clapboard was needed it was put on where paint was required it was
usedthat is evident and a look at the great barns stored with hay
shows how the fields have been conscientiously educated into giving a
full crop

To such a spot as this might any tired or sinful heart come for
rest hoping somehow in the midst of such frugality and thrift such
selfdenying labor such temperate use of Gods good gifts such shining
cleanliness of outward things to regain and wear the white flower of
a blameless life The very air of the place breathed peace so thought
Susanna Hathaway and little Sue who skipped by her side thought
nothing at all save that she was with mother in the country that it had
been rather a sad journey with mother so quiet and pale and that she
would be very glad to see supper should it rise like a fairy banquet in
the midst of these strange surroundings

It was only a mile and a half from the railway station to the Shaker
Settlement and Susanna knew the road well for she had driven over it
more than once as child and girl A boy would bring the little trunk
that contained their simple necessities later on in the evening so
she and Sue would knock at the door of the house where visitors were
admitted and be undisturbed by any gossiping company while they were
pleading their case

Are we most there Mardie asked Sue for the twentieth time Look at
me Im being a butterfly or perhaps a white pigeon No Id rather be
a butterfly and then I can skim along faster and move my wings

The airy little figure all lightness and brightness danced along the
road the white cotton dress rising and falling the whitestockinged
legs much in evidence the arms outstretched as if in flight straw hat
falling off yellow hair and a little wisp of swansdown scarf floating
out behind like the drapery of a baby Mercury

We are almost there her mother answered You can see the buildings
now if you will stop being a butterfly Dont you like them

Yes I specially like them all so white Is it a town Mardie

It is a village but not quite like other villages I have told you
often about the Shaker Settlement where your grandmother brought me
once when I was just your age There was a thunderstorm they kept
us all night and were so kind that I never forgot them Then your
grandmother and I stopped off once when we were going to Boston I was
ten then and I remember more about it The same sweet Eldress was there
both times

What is an Elderess Mardie

A kind of everybodys mother she seemed to be Susanna responded
with a catch in her breath

Id specially like her will she be there now Mardie

Im hoping so but it is eighteen years ago I was ten and she was
about forty I should think

Then o course shell be dead said Sue cheerfully or either shell
have no teeth or hair

People dont always die before they are sixty Sue

Do they die when they want to or when they must

Always when they must never never when they want to answered Sues
mother

But o course they would nt ever want to if they had any little girls
to be togedder with like you and me Mardie And Sue looked up with
eyes that were always like two interrogation points eager by turns and
by turns wistful but never satisfied

No Susanna replied brokenly of course they would nt unless
sometimes they were wicked for a minute or two and forgot

Do the Shakers shake all the time Mardie or just once in a while And
shall I see them do it

Sue dear I cant explain everything in the world to you while you are
so little you really must wait until youre more grown up The Shakers
dont shake and the Quakers dont quake and when youre older Ill
try to make you understand why they were called so and why they kept the
name

Maybe the Elderess can make me understand right off now Id
specially like it And Sue ran breathlessly along to the gate where
the North Family House stood in its stately whiteandgreen austerity

Susanna followed and as she caught up with the impetuous Sue the front
door of the house opened and a figure appeared on the threshold Mother
and child quickened their pace and went up the steps Susanna with
a hopeless burden of fear and embarrassment clogging her tongue and
dragging at her feet Sue so expectant of new disclosures and fresh
experiences that her face beamed like a full moon

Eldress Abby for it was Eldress Abby had indeed survived the heavy
weight of her fiftyfive or sixty summers and looked as if she might
reach a yet greater age She wore the simple Shaker afternoon dress of
drab alpaca an irreproachable muslin surplice encircled her straight
spare shoulders while her hair was almost entirely concealed by the
stiffly wired transparent whitenet cap that served as a frame to the
tranquil face The face itself was a network of delicate fine wrinkles
but every wrinkle must have been as lovely in Gods sight as it was in
poor unhappy Susanna Hathaways Some of them were graven by selfdenial
and hard work others perhaps meant the giving up of home of parents
and brothers or sisters perhaps some worldly love the love that Father
Adam bequeathed to the human family had been slain in Abbys youth and
the scars still remained to show the bodys suffering and the spirits
triumph At all events whatever foes had menaced her purity or her
tranquillity had been conquered and she exhaled serenity as the rose
sheds fragrance

Do you remember the little Nelson girl and her mother that stayed here
all night years ago asked Susanna putting out her hand timidly

Why seems to me I do assented Eldress Abby genially So many
comes and goes its hard to remember all Did nt you come once in a
thunderstorm

Yes one of your barns was struck by lightning and we sat up all
night Yee yee1 I remember well Your mother was a beautiful
spirit I could nt forget her

 1Yea is always thus pronounced by the Shakers

And we came once again mother and I and spent the afternoon with you
and went strawberrying in the pasture

Yee yee so we did I hope your mother continues in health

She died the very next year Susanna answered in a trembling voice
for the time of explanation was near at hand and her heart failed her

Wont you come into the sittingroom and rest a while You must be tired
walking from the deepot

No thank you not just yet Ill step into the front entry a
minuteSue run and sit in that rockingchair on the porch and watch
the cows going into the big barnDo you remember Eldress Abby the
second time I came how you sat me down in the kitchen with a bowl of
wild strawberries to hull for supper They were very small and ripe I
did my best for I never meant to be careless but the bowl slipped and
fell my legs were too short to reach the floor and I could nt make a
lap so in trying to pick up the berries I spilled juice on nay dress
and on the white apron you had tied on for me Then my fingers were
stained and wet and the hulls kept falling in with the soft berries
and when you came in and saw me you held up your hands and said Dear
dear you _have_ made a mess of your work Oh Eldress Abby theyve
come back to me all day those words Ive tried hard to be good but
somehow Ive made just such a mess of my life as I made of hulling the
berries The bowl is broken I have nt much fruit to show and I am
all stained and draggled I should nt have come to Albion on the five
oclock trainthat was an accident I meant to come at noon when you
could turn me away if you wanted to

Nay that is not the Shaker habit remonstrated Abby You and the
child can sleep in one of the spare chambers at the Office Building and
be welcome

But I want much more than that said Susanna tearfully I want to
come and live here where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage
I am so tired with my disappointments and discouragements and failures
that it is no use to try any longer I am Mrs Hathaway and Sue is my
child but I have left my husband for good and all and I only want
to spend the rest of my days here in peace and bring up Sue to a more
tranquil life than I have ever had I have a little money so that I
shall not be a burden to you and I will work from morning to night at
any task you set me

I will talk to the Family said Eldress Abby gravely but there are a
good many things to settle before we can say yee to all you ask

Let me confess everything freely and fully pleaded Susanna and if
you think Im to blame I will go away at once

Nay this is no time for that It is our duty to receive all and try
all then if you should be gathered in you would unburden your heart to
God through the Sister appointed to receive your confession

Will Sue have to sleep in the childrens building away from me

Nay not now you are company not a Shaker and anyway you could keep
the child with you till she is a little older thats not forbidden
at first though there comes a time when the ties of the flesh must be
broken All youve got to do nows to be pure and peaceable gentle
easy to be entreated and without hypocrisy Thats about all there is
to the Shaker creed and thats enough to keep us all busy

Sue ran in from the porch excitedly and caught her mothers hand

The cows have all gone into the barn she chattered and the Shaker
gentlemen are milking them and not one of them is shaking the least
bit for I specially noticed and I looked in through the porch window
and there is nice supper on a tablebread and butter and milk and dried
apple sauce and gingerbread and cottage cheese Is it for us Mardie

Susannas lip was trembling and her face was pale She lifted her
swimming eyes to the Sisters and asked Is it for us Eldress Abby

Yee its for you she answered theres always a Shaker supper on
the table for all who want to leave the husks and share the feast Come
right in and help yourselves I will sit down with you


Supper was over and Susanna and Sue were lying in a little upper
chamber under the stars It was the very one that Susanna had slept in
as a child or that she had been put to bed in for there was little
sleep that night for any one She had leaned on the windowsill with her
mother and watched the pillar of flame and smoke ascend from the burning
barn and once in the early morning she had stolen out of bed and
kneeling by the open window had watched the two silent Shaker brothers
who were guarding the smouldering ruins fearful lest the wind should
rise and bear any spark to the roofs of the precious buildings they had
labored so hard to save

The chamber was spotless and devoid of ornament The paint was robins
egg blue and of a satin gloss The shining floor was of the same color
and neat braided rugs covered exposed places near the bureau washstand
and bed Various useful articles of Shaker manufacture interested Sue
greatly the exquisite strawwork that covered the whiskbroom the
mendingbasket pincushion needlebook spool and watchcases
hairreceivers pintrays might all have been put together by fairy
fingers

Sues prayers had been fervent but a trifle disjointed covering all
subjects from Jack and Fardie to Grandma in heaven and Aunt Louisa
at the farm with special references to Elderess Abby and the Shaker
cows and petitions that the next day be fair so that she could see them
milked Excitement at her strange unaccustomed surroundings had put the
childs mind in a very whirl and she had astonished her mother with a
very new and disturbing version of the Lords Prayer ending God give
us our debts and help us to forget our debtors and theirs shall be the
glory Amen Now she lay quietly on the wall side of the clean narrow
bed while her mother listened to hear the regular breathing that would
mean that she was off for the land of dreams The childs sleep would
leave the mother free to slip out of bed and look at the stars free to
pray and long and wonder and suffer and repent not wholly but in part
for she was really at peace in all but the innermost citadel of her
conscience She had left her husband and for the moment at all events
she was fiercely glad but she had left her boy and Jack was only ten
Jack was not the helpless clinging sort he was a little piece of his
father and his favorite Aunt Louisa would surely take him and Jack
would scarcely feel the difference for he had never shown any special
affection for anybody Still he was her child nobody could possibly
get around that fact and it was a stumblingblock in the way of
forgetfulness or ease of mind Oh but for that what unspeakable
content she could feel in this quiet haven this selfrespecting
solitude To have her thoughts her emotions her words her self
to herself once more as she had had them before she was married at
seventeen To go to sleep in peace without listening for a step she had
once heard with gladness but that now sometimes stumbled unsteadily on
the stair or to dream as happy women dreamed without being roused by
the voice of the present John a voice so different from that of the
past John that it made the heart ache to listen to it

Sues voice broke the stillness How long are we going to stay here
Mardie

I dont know Sue I think perhaps as long as theyll let us

Will Fardie come and see us

I dont expect him

Wholl take care of Jack Mardie

Your Aunt Louisa

Shell scold him awfully but he never cries he just says Pooh what
do I care Oh I forgot to pray for that very nicest Shaker gentleman
that said hed let me help him feed the calves Had nt I better get out
of bed and do it Id specially like to

Very well Sue and then go to sleep

Safely in bed again there was a long pause and then the eager little
voice began Wholl take care of Fardie now

Hes a big man he does nt need anybody

What if hes sick

We must go back to him I suppose

Tomorrow s Sunday what if he needs us tomorrow Mardie

I dont know I dont know Oh Sue Sue dont ask your wretched
mother any more questions for she cannot bear them tonight Cuddle
up close to her love her and forgive her and help her to know whats
right




II A Son of Adam

When Susanna Nelson at seventeen married John Hathaway she had the
usual cogent reasons for so doing with some rather more unusual ones
added thereto She was alone in the world and her life with an uncle
her mothers only relative was an unhappy one No assistance in the
household tasks that she had ever been able to render made her a welcome
member of the family or kept her from feeling a burden and she belonged
no more to the little circle at seventeen than she did when she became a
part of it at twelve The hope of being independent and earning her own
living had sustained her through the last year but it was a very timid
selfdistrustful lovestarved little heart that John Hathaway stormed
and carried by assault Her girls life in a country school and her
uncles very rigid and orthodox home had been devoid of emotion or
experience still her mother had early sown seeds in her mind and
spirit that even in the most arid soil were certain to flower into
beauty when the time for flowering came and intellectually Susanna was
the clever daughter of clever parents She was very immature because
after early childhood her environment had not been favorable to her
development At seventeen she began to dream of a future as bright
as the past had been dreary and uneventful Visions of happiness of
goodness and of service haunted her and sometimes gleaming through
the mists of dawning womanhood the figure all luminous of The Man

When John Hathaway appeared on the horizon she promptly clothed him in
all the beautiful garments of her dreams they were a grotesque misfit
but when we intimate that women have confused the dream and the reality
before and may even do so again we make the only possible excuse for
poor little Susanna Nelson

John Hathaway was the very image of the outer world that lay beyond
Susannas village He was a fairly prosperous genial handsome young
merchant who looked upon life as a place furnished by Providence in
which to have a good time His parents had frequently told him that
it was expedient for him to settle down and he supposed that he might
finally do so if he should ever find a girl who would tempt him to
relinquish his liberty The line that divides liberty and license was
a little vague to John Hathaway It is curious that he should not
have chosen for his lifepartner some thoughtless rosy romping young
person whose highest conception of connubial happiness would have been
to drive twenty miles to the seashore on a Sunday and having partaken
of all the seasons delicacies solid and liquid to come home hilarious
by moonlight That however is not the way the little loveimps do
their work in the world or is it possible that they are not imps at all
who provoke and stimulate and arrange these strange marriages not imps
but honest chastening little characterbuilders In any event the
moment that John Hathaway first beheld Susanna Nelson was the moment
of his surrender yet the wooing was as incomprehensible as that of a
fragile dainty little hummingbird by a pompous greedy bigbreasted
robin

Susanna was like a New England anemone Her face was oval in shape and
as smooth and pale as a pearl Her hair was dark not very heavy and as
soft as a childs Her lips were delicate and sensitive her eyes a cool
grayclear steady and shaded by darker lashes When John Hathaway
met her shy maidenly glance and heard her pretty dovelike voice it
is strange he did not see that there was a bit too much saint in her to
make her a willing comrade of his gay roistering life But as a matter
of fact John Hathaway saw nothing at all nothing but that Susanna
Nelson was a lovely girl and he wanted her for his own The type was
one he had never met before one that allured him by its mysteries and
piqued him by its shy aloofness

John had a way with him a way that speedily won Susanna and after
all there was a best to him as well as a worst He had a twinkling
eye an infectious laugh a sweet disposition and while he was
oversusceptible to the charm of a pretty face he had a chivalrous
admiration for all women coupled it must be confessed with a decided
lack of discrimination in values His boyish lightheartedness had a
charm for everybody including Susanna a charm that lasted until she
discovered that his heart was light not only when it ought to be light
but when it ought to be heavy He was very much in love with her
but there was nothing particularly exclusive unique individual or
interesting about his passion at that time It was of the everyday sort
which carries a wellmeaning man to the altar and sometimes in cases
of exceptional fervor and duration even a little farther Stock sizes
of this article are common and inexpensive and John Hathaways love
when he married Susanna was judged by the highest standards about
as trivial an affair as Cupid ever put upon the market or a man ever
offered to a woman Susanna on the same day offered John or the wooden
idol she was worshiping as John her whole selfmind body heart
and spirit So the couple were united and smilingly signed the
marriageregister a rite by which their love for each other was
supposed to be made eternal

 Will you love me said he
 Will you love me said she
 Then they answered together
 Through foul and fair weather
 From sunrise to moonrise
 From moonrise to sunrise
 By heath and by harbour
 In orchard or arbour
 In the time of the rose
 In the time of the snows
 Through smoke and through smother
 Well love one another

Cinderella when the loverprince discovers her and fits the crystal
slipper to her foot makes short work of flinging away her rags and
in some such pretty airy unthinking way did Susanna fling aside the
dullness inhospitality and ugliness of her uncles home and depart in
a cloud of glory on her wedding journey She had been lonely now she
would have companionship She had been of no consequence now she would
be queen of her own small domain She had been last with everybody now
she would be first with one at least She had worked hard and received
neither compensation nor gratitude henceforward her service would be
gladly rendered at an altar where votive offerings would not be taken
as a matter of course She was only a slip of a girl now marriage and
housewifely cares would make her a woman Some time perhaps the last
great experience of life would come to her and then what a crown of
joys would be herslove husband home children What a vision it
was and how soon the chief glory of it faded

Never were two beings more hopelessly unlike than John Hathaway
single and John Hathaway married but the bliss lasted a few years
nevertheless partly because Susannas charm was deep and penetrating
the sort to hold a false man for a time and a true man forever partly
because she tried as a girl or woman has seldom tried before to do her
duty and to keep her own ideal unshattered

John had always been convivial but Susanna at seventeen had been at
once too innocent and too ignorant to judge a mans tendencies truly
or to rate his character at its real worth As time went on his earlier
leanings grew more definite he spent on pleasure far more than he could
afford and his conduct became a byword in the neighborhood His boy
he loved He felt on a level with Jack could understand him play
with him punish him and make friends with him but little Sue was
different She always seemed to him the concentrated essence of her
mothers soul and when unhappy days came he never looked in her
radiant searching eyes without a consciousness of inferiority The
little creature had loved her jolly handsome careless father at first
even though she feared him but of late she had grown shy silent and
timid for his indifference chilled her and she flung herself upon
her mothers love with an almost unchildlike intensity This unhappy
relation between the child and the father gave Susannas heart new
pangs She still loved her husband not dearly but a good deal and
over and above that remnant of the old love which still endured she gave
him unstinted care and hopeful maternal tenderness

The crash came in course of time John transcended the bounds of his
wifes patience more and more She made her last protests then she took
one passionate day to make up her mind a day when John and the boy
were away together a day of complete revolt against everything she was
facing in the present and so far as she could see everything that she
had to face in the future Prayer for light left her in darkness and
she had no human creature to advise her Conscience was overthrown she
could see no duty save to her own outraged personality Often and often
during the year just past she had thought of the peace the grateful
solitude and shelter of that Shaker Settlement hidden among New England
orchards that quiet haven where there was neither marrying nor giving
in marriage Now her bruised heart longed for such a life of nunlike
simplicity and consecration where men and women met only as brothers
and sisters where they worked side by side with no thought of personal
passion or personal gain but only for the common good of the community

Albion village was less than three hours distant by train She hastily
gathered her plainest clothes and Sues packed them in a small
trunk took her mothers watch her own little store of money and the
twentydollar gold piece Johns senior partner had given Sue on her last
birthday wrote a letter of goodbye to John and went out of her cottage
gate in a storm of feeling so tumultuous that there was no room for
reflection Besides she had reflected and reflected for months
and months so she would have said and the time had come for action
Susanna was not unlettered but she certainly had never read Meredith or
she would have learned that love is an affair of two and only for two
that can be as quick as constant in intercommunication as are sun and
earth through the cloud or face to face They take their breath of
life from each other in signs of affection proofs of faithfulness
incentives to admiration But a solitary soul dragging a log must make
the log a God to rejoice in the burden The demigod that poor blind
Susanna married had vanished and she could drag the log no longer but
she made one mistake in judging her husband in that she regarded him
at thirtytwo as a finished product a man who was finally this and
that and behaved thus and so and would never be any different

The age of discretion is a movable feast of extraordinary uncertainty
and John Hathaway was a little behindhand in overtaking it As a matter
of fact he had never for an instant looked life squarely in the face
He took a casual glance at it now and then after he was married but it
presented no very distinguishable features nothing to make him stop
and think nothing to arouse in him any special sense of responsibility
Boys have a way of growing up however sooner or later at least
most of them have and that possibility was not sufficiently in the
foreground of Susannas mind when she finished what she considered an
exhaustive study of her husbands character

I am leaving you John she wrote to see if I can keep the little love
I have left for you as the father of my children I seem to have lost
all the rest of it living with you I am not perfectly sure that I
am right in going for everybody seems to think that women mothers
especially should bear anything rather than desert the home I could
not take Jack away for you love him and he will be a comfort to you A
comfort to you yes but what will you be to him now that he is growing
older That is the thought that troubles me yet I dare not take him
with me when he is half yours You will not miss me nor will the loss
of Sue make any difference Oh John how can you help loving that
blessed little creature so much better and so much more gifted than
either of us that we can only wonder how we came to be her father and
mother Your sin against her is greater than that against me for at
least you are not responsible for bringing me into the world I know
Louisa will take care of Jack and she lives so near that you can see
him as often as you wish I shall let her know my address which I have
asked her to keep to herself She will write to me if you or Jack should
be seriously ill but not for any other reason

As for you there is nothing more that I can say except to confess
freely that I was not the right wife for you and that mine was not the
only mistake I have tried my very best to meet you in everything that
was not absolutely wrong and I have used all the arguments I could
think of but it only made matters worse I thought I knew you John
in the old days How comes it that we have traveled so far apart we
who began together It seems to me that some time you must come to your
senses and take up your life seriously for this is not life the sorry
thing you have lived lately but I cannot wait any longer I am tired
tired tired of waiting and hoping too tired to do anything but drag
myself away from the sight of your folly You have wasted our childrens
substance indulged your appetites until you have lost the respect of
your best friends and you have made mewho was your choice your wife
the head of your house the woman who brought your children into the
worldyou have made me an object of pity a poor neglected thing who
could not meet her neighbors eyes without blushing

When Jack and his father returned from their outing at eight oclock in
the evening having had supper at a wayside hotel the boy went to bed
philosophically lighting his lamp for himself the conclusion being
that the two other members of the household were a little late but
would be in presently

The next morning was bright and fair Jack waked at cockcrow and after
calling to his mother and Sue jumped out of bed ran into their rooms
to find them empty then bounced down the stairs two at a time going
through the sittingroom on his way to find Ellen in the kitchen His
father was sitting at the table with the stilllighted student lamp on
it the table where lessons had been learned books read stories told
mending done checkers and dominoes played the big round walnut table
that was the focus of the family lifebut mothers table not fathers

John Hathaway had never left his chair nor taken off his hat His cane
leaned against his knee his gloves were in his left hand while the
right held Susannas letter

He was asleep although his lips twitched and he stirred uneasily His
face was haggard and behind his closed lids somewhere in the center
of thought and memory a train of fiery words burned in an everwidening
circle round and round and round ploughing searing their way through
some obscure part of him that had heretofore been without feeling but
was now all quick and alive with sensation

You have made mewho was your choice your wife the head of your
house the woman who brought your children into the worldyou have made
me an object of pity a poor neglected thing who could not meet her
neighbors eyes without blushing

Any one who wished to pierce John Hathaways armor at that period of his
life would have had to use a very sharp and pointed arrow for he was
well wadded with the belief that a man has a right to do what he likes
Susannas shaft was tipped with truth and dipped in the blood of her
outraged heart The storedup force of silent years went into the
speeding of it She had never shot an arrow before and her skill was
instinctive rather than scientific but the powers were on her side and
she aimed better than she knewthose who took note of John Hathaways
behavior that summer would have testified willingly to that It was the
summer in which his boyish irresponsibility slipped away from him
once and for all a summer in which the face of life ceased to be an
indistinguishable mass of meaningless events and disclosed an order
a reason a purpose hitherto unseen and undefined The boy grew up
rather tardily it must be confessed His soul had not added a cubit to
its stature in sunshine gayety and prosperity it took the shock of
grief hurt pride solitude and remorse to make a man of John Hathaway




III Divers Doctrines


It was a radiant July morning in Albion village and when Sue first
beheld it from the bedroom window at the Shaker Settlement she had
wished ardently that it might never never grow dark and that Jack and
Fardie might be having the very same sunshine in Farnham It was not
noon yet but experience had in some way tempered the completeness of
her joy for the marks of tears were on her pretty little face She had
neither been scolded nor punished but she had been dragged away from
a delicious play without any adequate reason She had disappeared after
breakfast while Susanna was helping Sister Tabitha with the beds and
the dishes but as she was the most docile of children her mother never
thought of anxiety At nine oclock Eldress Abby took Susanna to the
laundry house and there under a spreading maple were Sue and the two
youngest little Shakeresses children of seven and eight respectively
Sue was directing the plays chattering planning ordering and
suggesting expedients to her slowerminded and less experienced
companions They had dragged a large box from one of the sheds and set
it up under the tree The interior had been quickly converted into
a commodious residence one not in the least of a Shaker type Small
bluingboxes served for bedstead and diningtable bits of broken
china for the dishes while tiny flat stones were the seats and four
clothespins tastefully clad in handkerchiefs surrounded the table

Do they kneel in prayer before they eat as all Believers do asked
Shaker Mary

I dont believe Adam and Eve was Believers cause who would have
taught them to be replied Sue still we might let them pray anyway
though clothespins dont kneel nicely

Ive got another one all dressed said little Shaker Jane

We cant have any more Adam and Eve did nt have only two children in
my SundaySchool lesson Cain and Abel objected Sue

Cant this one be a company pleaded Mary anxious not to waste the
clothespin

But where could compny come from queried Sue There was nt any
more people anywheres but just Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel Put the
clothespin in your apronpocket Jane and bimeby well let Eve have a
little new baby and Ill get Mardie to name it right out of the Bible
Now lets begin Adam is awfully tired this morning he says Eve Ive
been workin all night and I cant eat my breakfuss Now Mary you be
Cain hes a little boy and you must say Fardie play a little with
me please and Fardie will say Childen should nt talk at the

What subjects of conversation would have been aired at the Adamic family
board before breakfast was finished will never be known for Eldress
Abby with a firm but not unkind grasp took Shaker Jane and Mary by
their little hands and said Mornings not the time for play run over
to Sister Martha and help her shell the peas then therell be your
seams to oversew

Sue watched the disappearing children and saw the fabric of her dream
fade into thin air but she was a person of considerable individuality
for her years Her lip quivered tears rushed to her eyes and flowed
silently down her cheeks but without a glance at Eldress Abby or a word
of comment she walked slowly away from the laundry her chin high

Sue meant all right she was only playing the plays of the world said
Eldress Abby but you can well understand Susanna that we cant let
our Shaker children play that way and get wrong ideas into their heads
at the beginning We dont condemn an honest orderly marriage as a
worldly institution but we claim it has no place in Christs kingdom
therefore we leave it to the world where it belongs The worlds people
live on the lower plane of Adam the Shakers try to live on the Christ
plane in virgin purity longsuffering meekness and patience

I see I know Susanna answered slowly with a little glance at
injured Sue walking toward the house but we need nt leave the
children unhappy this morning for I can think of a play that will
comfort them and please you Come back Sue Wait a minute Mary and
Jane before you go to Sister Martha We will play the story that Sister
Tabitha told us last week Do you remember about Mother Ann Lee in the
English prison The soapbox will be her cell for it was so small she
could not lie down in it Take some of the shingles Jane and close
up the open side of the box Do you see the large brown spot in one of
them Mary Push that very hard with a clothespin and there ll be a
hole through the shingle thats right Now Sister Tabitha said that
Mother Ann was kept for days without food for people thought she was a
wicked dangerous woman and they would have been willing to let her
die of starvation But there was a great keyhole in the door and James
Whittaker a boy of nineteen who loved Mother Ann and believed in her
put the stem of a clay pipe in the hole and poured a mixture of wine and
milk through it He managed to do this day after day so that when the
jailer opened the cell door expecting to find Mother Ann dying for lack
of food she walked out looking almost as strong and well as when she
entered You can play it all out and afterwards you can make the ship
that brought Mother Ann and the other Shakers from Liverpool to New
York The clothespins can be who will they be Jane

William Lee Nancy Lee James Whittaker and I forget the others
recited Jane like an obedient parrot

And it will be splendid to have James Whittaker for he really came to
Albion said Mary

Perhaps he stood on this very spot more than once mused Abby It was
Mother Anns vision that brought them to this land a vision of a large
tree with outstretching branches every leaf of which shone with the
brightness of a burning torch Oh if the vision would only come true
If Believers would only come to us as many as the leaves on the tree
she sighed as she and Susanna moved away from the group of chattering
children all as eager to play the history of Shakerism as they had been
to dramatize the family life of Adam and Eve

There must be so many men and women without ties living useless lives
with no aim or object in them Susanna said I wonder that more of
them do not find their way here The peace and goodness and helpfulness
of the life sink straight into my heart The Brothers and Sisters are so
friendly and cheery with one another there is neither gossip nor hard
words there is pleasant work and your thoughts seem to be all so
concentrated upon right living that it is like heaven below only I feel
that the cross is there bravely as you all bear it

 There are roses on my cross most beautiful to see
 As I turn from all the dross from which it sets me free

quoted Eldress Abby devoutly

It is easy enough for me continued Susanna for it was no cross
for me to give up my husband at the time but oh if a woman had a
considerate loving man to live with one who would strengthen her and
help her to be good one who would protect and cherish her one who
would be an example to his children and bring them up in the fear of the
Lordthat would be heaven below too and how could she bear to give
it all up when it seems so good so true so right Might nt two people
walk together to God if both chose the same path

Its my belief that one can find the road better alone than when
somebody else is going alongside to distract them Not that the Lord
is going to turn anybody away not even when they bring Him a lot of
burnedout trash for a gift said Eldress Abby bluntly But dont you
believe He sees the difference between a person that comes to Him when
there is nowhere else to turna person thats tried all and found it
wantingand one that gives up freely pleasure and gain and husband
and home to follow the Christ life

Yes He must He must Susanna answered faintly But the children
Eldress Abby If you had nt any you could perhaps keep yourself from
wanting them but if you had how could you give them up Jesus was the
great Saviour of mankind but next to Him it seems as if the children
had been the little saviours from the time the first one was born until
this very day

Yee Ive no doubt they keep the worst of the worlds people those
that are living in carnal marriage without a thought of godliness Ive
no doubt children keep that sort from going to the lowest perdition
allowed Eldress Abby and those we bring up in the Community make the
best converts but to a Shaker the greater the sacrifice the greater
the glory I wish you was gathered in Susanna for your hands and feet
are quick to serve your face is turned toward the truth and your heart
is all ready to receive the revelation

I wish I need nt turn my back on one set of duties to take up
another murmured Susanna timidly

Yee no doubt you do Your business is to find out which are the higher
duties and then do those Just make up your mind whether youd rather
replenish earth as youve been doing or replenish heaven as were
trying to do But I must go to my work ten oclock in the mornings
a poor time to be discussing doctrine Youre for weeding Susanna I
suppose

Brother Ansel was seated at a grindstone under the apple trees teaching
intermittently a couple of boys to grind a scythe when Susanna came
to her work in the herbgarden Sue walking discreetly at her heels

Ansel was a slowmoving humorouslyinclined easygoing Brother who was
drifting into the kingdom of heaven without any special effort on his
part

Id bout as lives be a Shaker as anything else had been his rather
dubious statement of faith when he requested admittance into the band
of Believers No more crosses accordin to my notion an considable
more chance o crowns

His experience of life on the Adamic plane the holy estate of
matrimony being the chief sin of this way of thought had disposed
him to regard woman as an apparently necessary but not especially
desirable being The theory of holding property in common had no
terrors for him He was generous unambitious frugalminded somewhat
lacking in energy and just as actively interested in his brothers
welfare as in his own which is perhaps not saying much Shakerism was
to him not a craving of the spirit not a longing of the soul but a
simple prudent theory of existence lessening the various risks that
man is exposed to in his journey through this vale of tears

Womenfolks makes splendid Shakers he was wont to say Theyre all
right as Sisters cause their belief makes em safe It kind o shears
em o their strength tames their sperits takes the sting out of em
an keeps em from bein sassy an domineerin Jest as long as they
think marriage is right theyll marry ye spite of anything ye can do or
sayfour of em married my father one after another though he fit em
off as hard as he knew how But if ye can once get the faith o Mother
Ann into em theyre as good afterwards as they was wicked afore
Theres no stoppin womenfolks once ye get em started they dont keer
whether its heaven or the other place so long as they get where they
want to go

Elder Daniel Gray had heard Brother Ansel state his religious theories
more than once when he was first gathered in and secretly lamented
the lack of spirituality in the new convert The Elder was an instrument
more finely attuned sober humble pureminded zealous consecrated to
the truth as he saw it he labored in and out of season for the faith
he held so dear yet as the years went on he noted that Ansel
notwithstanding his eccentric views lived an honest temperate
Godfearing life talking no scandal dwelling in unity with his brethren
and sisters and upholding the banner of Shakerism in his own peculiar
way

As Susanna approached him Ansel called out The yairbs are all ready
for ye Susanna the weeds have been on the rampage sence yesterdays
rain Seems like the more uselesser a thing is the more it flourishes
The yairbs grow oh yes they make out to _grow_ but you dont see em
come leapin an tearin out o the airth like weeds Then theres the
birds Ive jest been stoppin my grindin to look at em carry on
Take em all in all there aint nothin so lazy an aimless an
busy bout nothin as birds They go kitin roun from tree to tree
hoppin an chirpin flyin here an there thout no airthly objeck
ceptin to fly back agin Theres a heap o useless critters in
the univarse but I guess birds are bout the uselessest less its
grasshoppers mebbe

I dont care what you say about the grasshoppers Ansel but you shant
abuse the birds said Susanna stooping over the beds of tansy and
sage thyme and summer savory Weeds or no weeds were going to have a
great crop of herbs this year Ansel

Yee so we be We sowed moren usual sos to keep the two jiners at
work longs we couldTake that scythe over to the barn Jacob an
fetch me another an step spry

Whats a jiner Ansel

Winter Shakers I call em Theyre reglar constitooshanal
dyedinthewool jiners jinin most anything an hookin on most
anywheres They jine when it comes on too cold to sleep outdoors an
they onjine when it comes on spring Elder Grays always hopin to
gather in new souls so he gives the best of em a few months trial
How are ye Hannah he called to a Sister passing through the orchard
to search for any possible green apples under the trees Make us a good
oldfashioned deepdish pandowdy an well all do our best to eat it

I suppose the jiners get discouraged and fear they cant keep up to
the standard Not everybody is good enough to lead a selfdenying Shaker
life said Susanna pushing back the close sunbonnet from her warm
face which had grown younger smoother and sweeter in the last few
weeks

Nay I spose likely less theyre same as me a born Shaker Ansel
replied I dont hanker after strong drink dont like tobaccer
always could keep my temper thout smokin aint particlar bout
meateatin dont keer bout heapin up riches cant stand the ways
o worldly womenfolks jest as lives confess my sins to the Elder as
not cause I haint sinned any to amount to anything sence I made my
first confession there I be a natural follerer o Mother Ann Lee

Susanna drew her Shaker bonnet forward over her eyes and turned her
back to Brother Ansel under the pretense of reaching over to the rows of
sweet marjoram She had never supposed it possible that she could laugh
again and indeed she seldom felt like it but Ansels interpretations
of Shaker doctrine were almost too much for her latent sense of humor

What are you smiling at and me so sad Mardie quavered Sue
piteously from the little plot of easy weeding her mother had given her
to do I keep remembering my game It was such a _Christian_ game
too Lots nicer than Mother Ann in prison for Jane said her mother
and father was both Believers and nobody was good enough to pour milk
through the keyhole but her I wanted to give the clothespins story
names like Hilda and Percy but I called them Adam and Eve and Cain and
Abel just because I thought the Shakers would specially like a Bible
play I love Elderess Abby but she does stop my happiness Mardie
Thats the second time today for she took Moses away from me when I was
kissing him because he pinched his thumb in the window

Why did you do that Sue remonstrated her mother softly remembering
Ansels proximity You never used to kiss strange little boys at home
in Farnham

Moses is nt a boy hes only six and thats a baby besides I like
him better than any little boys at home and thats the reason I kissed
him theres no harm in boykissing is there Mardie

You dont know anybody here very well yet not well enough to
kiss them Susanna answered rather hopeless as to the best way of
inculcating the undesirability of the Adamic plane of thought at this
early age While we stay here Sue we ought both to be very careful to
do exactly as the Shakers do

By this time mother and child had reached the orchard end of a row
and Brother Ansel was thirstily waiting to deliver a little more of the
information with which his mind was always teeming

Them Boston people that come over to our public meetin last Sunday
he began they was dretful scairt bout what would become o the human
race if it should all turn Shakers I guess you need nt worry I
says itll take considable of a spell to convert all you city folks
I says an after all what if the world should come to an end I
says If half we hear is true bout the way folks carry on in New York
and Chicago its bout time it stopped I says an I guess the
Lord could do a considable better job on a second one I says after
findin out the weak places in this They cant stand givin up their
possessions the worlds folks thats the principal trouble with em
If you dont have nothin to give up like some o the tramps that
happen along here and convince the Elder theyre jest bustin with the
fear o God why o course t aint no trick at all to be a Believer

Did you have much to give up Brother Ansel Susanna asked Bouts
much as any sinner ever had that jined this Community replied Ansel
complacently The list o what I consecrated to this Society when I was
gathered in was One horse one wagon one twoyearold heifer one axe
one saddle one padlock one bed and bedding four turkeys eleven hens
one pair o ploughirons two chains and eleven dollars in cash Can
you beat that

Oh yes things said Susanna absentmindedly I was thinking of
family and friends pleasures and memories and ambitions and hopes

I guess it dont pinch you any worse to give up a hope than it would a
good twoyearold heifer retorted Ansel but there you cant never
tell what folksll hang on to the hardest The man that drove them
Boston folks over here last Sunday did you notice him the one that had
the sister with a bright red dress an hat onLand I could think just
how hell must look whenever my eye lighted on that girls gitupWell
I done my best to exhort that driver bein as how we had a good chance
to talk while we was hitchin an unhitchin the team an Elder Gray
always says I aint earnest enough in preachin the faithbut he did
nt learn anything from the meetin Kep his eye on the Shaker bunnits
an took notice o the marchin an dancin but he did nt care nothin
bout doctrine

I draw the line at bein a cerebrate he says Im willin to sell
all my goods an divide with the poor he says but I aint goin
to lie no cerebrate If I dont have no other luxuries I will have a
wife he says Ive hed three an if this one dont last me out Ill
get another if its only to start the kitchen fire in the mornin an
put the cat in the shed nights




IV Louisas Mind


Louisa otherwise Mrs Adlai Banks the elder sister of Susanna s
husband was a rockribbed widow of fortyfive summersfortyfive
winters would seem a better phrase in which to assert her agewho
resided on a small farm twenty miles from the manufacturing town of
Farnham

When the Fates were bestowing qualities of mind and heart upon the
Hathaway babies they gave the more graceful genial likable ones to
John not realizing perhaps what bad use he would make of themand
endowed Louisa with great deposits of honesty sincerity energy
piety and frugality all so mysteriously compounded that they turned to
granite in her hands If she had been consulted it would have been all
the same She would never have accepted Johns charm of personality at
the expense of being saddled with his weaknesses and he would not have
taken her castiron virtues at any price whatsoever

She was sweeping her porch on that day in May when Susanna and Sue
had wakened in the bare upper chamber at the Shaker SettlementSue
cleareyed jubilant expectant unafraid Susanna pale from her fitful
sleep weary with the burden of her heart

Looking down the road Mrs Banks espied the form of her brother John
walking in her direction and leading Jack by the hand

This was a most unusual sight for Johns calls had been uncommonly few
of late years since a man rarely visits a lady relative for the mere
purpose of hearing a piece of her mind This piece large solid
highly flavored with pepper and as acid as mental vinegar could make
it was Louisa Bankss only contribution to conversation when she met
her brother She could not stop for any airy persiflage about weather
crops or politics when her one desire was to tell him what she thought
of him

Goodmorning Louisa Shake hands with your aunt Jack

He cant till Im through sweeping Goodmorning John what brings you
here

John sat down on the steps and Jack flew to the barn where there
was generally an amiable hired man and a cheerful cow both infinitely
better company than his highly respected and wealthy aunt

I came because I had to bring the boy to the only relation Ive got in
the world John answered tersely My wifes left me

Well shes been a great while doing it remarked Louisa digging
her broom into the cracks of the piazza floor and making no pause for
reflection If she had nt had the patience of Job and the meekness of
Moses shed have gone long before Whered she go

I dont know she did nt say

Did you take the trouble to look through the house for her I aint
certain you fairly know her by sight nowadays do you

John flushed crimson but bit his lip in an attempt to keep his temper
She left a letter he said and she took Sue with her

That was all right Sues a nervous little thing and needs at least
one parent she has nt been used to more so she wont miss anything
Jacks like most of the Hathaways hell grow up his own way without
anybodys help or hindrance What are you going to do with him

Leave him with you of course What else could I do Very well Ill
take him and while Im about it Id like to give you a piece of my
mind

John was fighting for selfcontrol but he was too wretched and
remorseful for rage to have any real sway over him

Is it the same old piece or a different one he asked setting his
teeth grimly I should nt think youd have any mind left youve given
so many pieces of it to me already

I have some left and plenty too answered Louisa dashing into the
house banging the broom into a corner coming out again like a breeze
and slamming the door behind her You can leave the boy here and
welcome Ill take good care of him and if you dont send me twenty
dollars a month for his food and clothes Ill turn him outdoors The
more responsibility other folks rid you of the more youll let em
and I wont take a feathers weight off you for fear youll sink into
everlasting perdition

I did nt expect any sympathy from you said John drearily pulling
himself up from the steps and leaning against the honeysuckle trellis
Susannas just the same Women are all as hard as the nether millstone
Theyre hard if theyre angels and hard if theyre devils it does nt
make much difference

I guess youve found a few soft ones if report says true returned
Louisa bluntly Youd better go and get some of their sympathy the
kind you can buy and pay for The way youve ruined your life turns
me fairly sick You had a good father and mother good education and
advantages enough money to start you in business the best of wives
and two children any man could be proud of one of em especially
Youve thrown em all away and what for Horses and cards and gay
company late suppers with wine and for aught I know whiskey you
the son of a man who did nt know the taste of ginger beer Youve spent
your days and nights with a pack of carousing men and women that would
take your last cent and not leave you enough for honest burial

Its a pity we did nt make a traveling preacher of you exclaimed
John bitterly Lord Almighty I wonder how such women as you can live
in the world you know so little about it and so little about men

I know all I want to about em retorted Louisa and precious
little thats good They re a gluttonous selfindulgent extravagant
reckless pleasureloving lot My husband was one of the best of em
and he would nt have amounted to a hill of beans if I had nt devoted
fifteen years to disciplining uplifting and strengthening him

You managed to strengthen him so that he died before he was fifty

It dont matter when a man dies said the remorseless Mrs Banks if
hes succeeded in living a decent Godfearing life As for you John
Hathaway Ill tell you the truth if you are my brother for Susannas
too much of a saint to speak out

Dont be afraid Susannas spoken out at last plainly enough to please
even you

Im glad of it for I did nt suppose she had spunk enough to resent
anything I shall be sorry tomorrow s likely as not for freeing
my mind as much as I have but my tempers up and Im going to be the
humble instrument of Providence and try to turn you from the error of
your ways Youve defaced and degraded the temple the Lord built for
you and if He should come this minute and try to turn out the crowd of
evildoers youve kept in it I doubt if He could

I hope Hell approve of the way youve used your temple said John
with stinging emphasis I should nt want to live in such a noisy one
myself Id rather be a bat in a belfry Goodbye Ive had a pleasant
call as usual and youve been a real sister to me in my trouble
You shall have the twenty dollars a month Jacks clothes are in that
valise and therell be a trunk tomorrow Susanna said shed write and
let you know her whereabouts

So saying John Hathaway strode down the path closed the gate behind
him and walked rapidly along the road that led to the station It was
a quiet road and he met few persons He had neither dressed nor shaved
since the day before his face was haggard his heart was like a lump of
lead in his breast Of what use to go to the empty house in Farnham when
he could stifle his misery by a night with his friends

No he could not do that either The very thought of them brought a
sense of satiety and disgust the craving for what they would give him
would come again in time no doubt but for the moment he was sick
to the very soul of all they stood for The feeling of complete
helplessness of desertion of being alone in midocean without a sail
or a star in sight mounted and swept over him Susanna had been his
sail his star although he had never fully realized it and he had
cut himself adrift from her pure steadfast love blinding himself with
cheap and vulgar charms

The next train to Farnham was not due for an hour His steps faltered
he turned into a clump of trees by the wayside and flung himself on the
ground to cry like a child he who had not shed a tear since he was a
boy of ten If Susanna could have seen that often longedfor burst of
despair and remorse that sudden recognition of his sins against himself
and her that gush of penitent tears her heart might have softened
once again a flicker of flame might have lighted the ashes of her dying
love she might have taken his head on her shoulder and said Never
mind John Lets forget and begin all over again


Matters did not look any brighter for John the next week for his senior
partner Joel Atterbury requested him to withdraw from the firm as soon
as matters could be legally arranged He was told that he had not been
doing nor earning his share that his way of living during the
year just past had not been any credit to the concern and that he
Atterbury sympathized too heartily with Mrs John Hathaway to take any
pleasure in doing business with Mr John

Johns remnant of pride completely humbled by this last withdrawal of
confidence would not suffer him to tell Atterbury that he had come
to his senses and bidden farewell to the old life or so he hoped and
believed To lose a wife and child in a way infinitely worse than
death to hear the unwelcome truth that as a husband you have grown so
offensive as to be beyond endurance to have your own sister tell you
that you richly deserve such treatment to be virtually dismissed from a
valuable business connection all this is enough to sober any man above
the grade of a moral idiot and John was not that he was simply a
selfindulgent pleasureloving thoughtless willful fellow without
any great amount of principle He took his medicine however said
nothing and did his share of the business from day to day doggedly
keeping away from his partner as much as possible

Ellen the faithful maid of all work stayed on with him at the old
home Jack wrote to him every week and often came to spend Sunday with
him

Aunt Louisas real good to me he told his father but shes not like
mother Seems to me mothers kind of selfish staying away from us so
long When do you expect her back

I dont know not before winter Im afraid and dont call her
selfish I wont have it Your mother never knew she had a self

If shed only left Sue behind we could have had more good times we
three together

No our family is four Jack and we can never have any good times
one two or three of us because were four When ones away whichever
it is its wrong but its the worst when its mother Does your Aunt
Louisa write to her

Yes sometimes but she never lets me post the letters

Do you write to your mother You ought to you know even if you dont
have time for me You could ask your aunt to enclose your letters in
hers

Do you write to her father

Yes I write twice a week John answered thinking drearily of the
semiweekly notes posted in Susannas empty worktable upstairs Would
she ever read them He doubted it unless he died and she came back to
settle his affairs but of course he would nt die no such good luck
Would a man die who breakfasted at eight dined at one supped at six
and went to bed at ten Would a man die who worked in the garden an
hour every afternoon with half a day Saturday that being the task most
disagreeable to him and most appropriate therefore for penance

Susanna loved flowers and had always wanted a garden but John had been
too much occupied with his own concerns to give her the needed help or
money so that she could carry out her plans The last year she had lost
heart in many ways so that little or nothing had been accomplished
of all she had dreamed It would have been laughable had it not been
pathetic to see John Hathaway dig delve grub sow water weed
transplant generally at the wrong moment in that dreamgarden
of Susannas He asked no advice and read no books With feverish
intensity with complete ignorance of Natures laws and small sympathy
with their intricacies he dug hoed raked fertilized and planted
during that lonely summer His absentmindedness caused some expensive
failures as when the wide expanse of Susannas drying ground which
was to be velvety lawn came up curly lettuce but he rooted out his
frequent mistakes and patiently planted seeds or roots or bulbs over and
over and over and over until something sprouted in his beds whether
it was what he intended or not While he weeded the brilliant orange
nasturtiums growing beside the magenta portulacca in a friendly
proximity that certainly would never have existed had the mistress of
the house been the headgardener he thought of nothing but his wife He
knew her pride her reserve her sensitive spirit he knew her love of
truth and honor and purity the standards of life and conduct she had
tried to hold him to so valiantly and which he had so dragged in the
dust during the blindness and the insanity of the last two years

He John Hathaway was a deserted husband Susanna had crept away all
wounded and resentful Where was she living and how supporting herself
and Sue when she could not have had a hundred dollars in the world
Probably Louisa was the source of income conscientious infernally
disagreeable Louisa

Would yet the rumor of his changed habit of life reach her by some means
in her place of hiding sooner or later Would she not yearn for a sight
of Jack Would she not finally give him a chance to ask forgiveness or
had she lost every trace of affection for him as her letter seemed to
imply He walked the garden paths with these and other unanswerable
questions and when he went to his lonely room at night he held the
lamp up to a bit of poetry that he had cut from a magazine and pinned to
the lookingglass If John Hathaway could be brought to the reading
of poetry he might even glance at the Bible in course of time Louisa
would have said It was in May that Susanna had gone and the first line
of verse held his attention

 May comes day comes
 One who was away comes
 All the earth is glad again
 Kind and fair to me

 May comes day comes
 One who was away comes
 Set her place at hearth and board
 As it used to be

 May comes day comes
 One who was away comes
 Higher are the hills of home
 Bluer is the sea

The Hathaway house was in the suburbs on a rise of ground and as John
turned to the window he saw the full moon hanging yellow in the sky
It shone on the verdant slopes and low wooded hills that surrounded the
town and cast a glittering pathway on the ocean that bathed the beaches
of the nearby shore

How long shall I have to wait he wondered before my hills of home
look higher and my sea bluer because Susanna has come back to hearth
and board




V The Little Quail Bird


Susanna had helped at various household tasks ever since her arrival at
the Settlement for there was no room for drones in the Shaker hive but
after a few weeks in the kitchen with Martha the herbgarden had been
assigned to her as her particular province the Sisters thinking her
better fitted for it than for the preserving and pickling of fruit or
the basketweaving that needed special apprenticeship

The Shakers were the first people to raise put up and sell garden
seeds in our presentday fashion and it was they too who began the
preparation of botanical medicines raising gathering drying and
preparing herbs and roots for market and this industry driven from
the field by modern machinery was still a valuable source of income in
Susannas day Plants had always grown for Susanna and she loved
them like friends humoring their weakness nourishing their strength
stimulating coaxing disciplining them until they could do no less
than flourish under her kind and hopeful hand

Oh that sweet honest comforting little garden of herbs with its
wholesome fragrances Healing lay in every root and stem in every leaf
and bud and the strong aromatic odors stimulated her flagging spirit or
her aching head after the sleepless nights in which she tried to decide
her future life and Sues

The plants were set out in neat rows and clumps and she soon learned to
know the strange oneschamomile lobelia bloodroot wormwood lovage
boneset lemon and sweet balm lavender and rue as well as she knew
the old acquaintances familiar to every countrybred childpennyroyal
peppermint or spearmint yellow dock and thoroughwort

There was hoeing and weeding before the gathering and drying came then
Brother Calvin who had charge of the great press would moisten the
dried herbs and press them into quarter and halfpound cakes ready for
Sister Martha who would superintend the younger Shakeresses in papering
and labeling them for the market Last of all when harvesting was over
Brother Ansel would mount the newly painted seedcart and leave on his
driving trip through the country Ansel was a capital salesman but
Brother Issachar who once took his place and sold almost nothing
brought home a lad on the seedcart who afterward became a shining
light in the Community Thus said Elder Gray does God teach us the
diversity of gifts whereby all may be unashamed

If the Albion Shakers were honest and ardent in faith Susanna thought
that their works would indeed bear the strictest examination The
Brothers made brooms floor and dishmops tubs pails and churns and
indeed almost every trade was represented in the various New England
Communities Physicians there were a few but no lawyers sheriffs
policemen constables or soldiers just as there were no courts or
saloons or jails Where there was perfect equality of possession and no
private source of gain it amazed Susanna to see the cheery labor often
continued late at night from the sheer joy of it and the earnest desire
to make the Settlement prosperous While the Brothers were hammering
nailing planing sawing ploughing and seeding the Sisters were
carding and spinning cotton wool and flax making kerchiefs of linen
straw Shaker bonnets and dozens of other useful marketable things not
forgetting their famous Shaker apple sauce

Was there ever such a busy summer Susanna wondered yet with all the
early rising constant labor and simple fare she was stronger and
hardier than she had been for years The Shaker palate was never tickled
with delicacies yet the food was well cooked and sufficiently varied
At first there had been the winter vegetables squash yellow turnips
beets and parsnips with once a week a special Shaker dinner of salt
codfish potatoes onions and milk gravy Each Sister served her
turn as cook but all alike had a wonderful hand with flour and the
wholewheat bread cookies ginger cake and milk puddings were marvels
of lightness Martha in particular could wean the novitiate Shaker
from a too riotous devotion to meateating better than most people for
every dish she sent to the table was delicate savory and attractive

Dear patient devoted Martha How Susanna learned to love her as
they worked together in the big sunny shining kitchen where the
cookingstove as well as every tin plate and pan and spoon might have
served as a mirror Martha had joined the Society in her mothers arms
being given up to the Lord and placed in the childrens order before
she was one year old

If you should unite with us Susanna she said one night after the
early supper when they were peeling apples together youd be thankful
you begun early with your little Sue for shes got a natural attraction
to the world and for it Not but that shes a tender loving obedient
little soul but when shes among the other young ones theres a
flyaway look about her that makes her seem more like a fairy than a
child

Shes having rather a hard time learning Shaker ways but shell do
better in time sighed her mother She came to me of her own accord
yesterday and asked Bettent I have my curls cut off Mardie

I never put that idea into her head Martha interrupted Shes a
visitor and can wear her hair as shes been brought up to wear it

I know but I fear Sue was moved by other than religious reasons I
get up so early Mardie she said and it takes so long to unsnarl and
untangle me and I get so hot when Im helping in the hayfield and then
I have to be curled for dinner and curled again for supper and so it
seems like wasting both our times Her hair would be all the stronger
for cutting I thought as its so long for her age but I could nt
put the shears to it when the time came Martha I had to take her to
Eldress Abby She sat up in front of the little lookingglass as still
as a mouse while the curls came off but when the last one fell into
Abbys apron she suddenly put her hands over her face and cried
Oh Mardie we shall never be the same togedder you and I after
thisShe seemed to see her little past her childhood slipping
away from her all in an instant I did nt let her know that I cried
over the box of curls last night

You did wrong rebuked Martha You should nt make an idol of your
child or your childs beauty

You dont think God might put beauty into the world just to give His
children joy Martha

Martha was no controversialist She had taken her opinions readymade
from those she considered her superiors and although she was willing to
make any sacrifice for her religion she did not wish to be confused by
too many opposing theories of Gods intentions

You know I never argue when Ive got anything baking she said and
taking the spill of a cornbroom from a tabledrawer she opened the
oven door and delicately plunged it into the loaf Then gazing at the
straw as she withdrew it she said You must talk doctrine with Eldress
Abby Susanna not with me but I guess doctrine wont help you so much
as thinking out your life for yourself

 No one can sing my psalm for me
 Reward must come from labor
 Ill sow for peace and reap in truth
 Gods mercy and his favor

Martha was the chief musician of the Community and had composed many
hymns and tunessome of them under circumstances that she believed
might entitle them to be considered directly inspired Her clear full
voice filled the kitchen and floated out into the air after Susanna as
she called Sue and darningbasket in hand walked across the road to
the great barn

The herbgarden was one place where she could think out her life
although no decision had as yet been born of those thoughtful mornings

Another spot for meditation was the great barn relic of the wonderful
earlier days and pride of the present Settlement A hundred and
seventyfive feet long and three and a half stories high it dominated
the landscape First there was the cellar where all the refuse fell
to do its duty later on in fertilizing the farm lands then came the
first floor where the stalls for horses oxen and cows lined the walls
on either side Then came the second floor where hay was kept and to
reach this a bridge forty feet long was built on stone piers ten feet
in height sloping up from the ground to the second story Over the easy
slope of this bridge the full haycarts were driven to add their several
burdens to the golden haymows High at the top was an enormous grain
room where mounds of yellow cornears reached from floor to ceiling
and at the back was a great window opening on Massabesic Pond and
Knights Hill with the White Mountains towering blue or snowcapped in
the distance There was an oldfashioned listbottomed straightbacked
Shaker chair in front of the open window a chair as uncomfortable as
Shaker doctrines to the daughter of Eve and there Susanna often sat
with her sewing or mending Sue at her feet building castles out of
corncobs plaiting the husks into little mats or taking out basting
threads from her mothers work

My head feels awfully undressed without my curls Mardie she said
Im most afraid Fardie wont like the looks of me do you think we
ought to have asked him before we shingled meHe does _despise_
unpretty things so

I think if we had asked him he would have said Do as you think
best

He always says that when he does nt care what you do observed Sue
with one of her startling bursts of intuition Sister Martha has a
printed card on the wall in the childrens diningroom and Ive got
to learn all the poetry on it because I need it worse than any of the
others

 What we deem good order were willing to state
 Eat hearty and decent and clear out your plate
 Be thankful to heaven for what we receive
 And not make a mixture or compound to leave

 We often find left on the same China dish
 Meat apple sauce pickle brown bread and minced fish
 Anothers replenished with butter and cheese
 With pie cake and toast perhaps added to these

You say it very nicely commended Susanna

Theres more

 Now if any virtue in this can be shown
 By peasant by lawyer or king on the throne
 We freely will forfeit whatever weve said
 And call it a virtue to waste meat and bread

Theres a great deal to learn when youre being a Shaker sighed Sue
as she finished her rhyme

Theres a great deal to learn everywhere her mother answered What
verse did Eldress Abby give you today

 For little tripping maids may follow God
 Along the ways that saintly feet have trod

quoted the child Am I a tripping maid Mardie she continued

Yes dear If I trip too much might nt I fall

Yes I suppose so

Is tripping the same as skipping

About the same

Is it polite to trip an skip when youre following God

It could nt be impolite if you meant to be good A tripping maid means
just a young one

What is a maid

A little girl

When a maid grows up what is she

Why shes a maiden I suppose

When a maiden grows up what is she

Just a woman Sue

What is saintly feet

Feet like those of Eldress Abby or Elder Gray feet of people who have
always tried to do right

Are Brother Ansels feet saintly

Hes a good kind hardworking man

Is good kind hardworking same as saintly

Well its not so very different perhaps Now Sue Ive asked you
before dont let your mind grope and your little tongue wag every
instant it is nt good for you and it certainly is nt good for me

All right but less I gropeanwag sometimes I dont see how Ill ever
learn the things I specially want to know sighed Sue the insatiable

Shall I tell you a Shaker story one that Eldress Abby told me last
evening

Oh do Mardie cried Sue crossing her feet folding her hands and
looking up into her mothers face expectantly

Once there was a very good Shaker named Elder Calvin Green and some
one wrote him a letter asking him to come a long distance and found
a Settlement in the western part of New York State He and some other
Elders and Eldresses traveled five days and stopped at the house of
a certain Joseph Pelham to spend Sunday and hold a meeting On
Monday morning very tired and wondering where to stay and begin his
preaching the Elder went out into the woods to pray for guidance When
he rose from his knees feeling stronger and lighterhearted a young
quail came up to him so close that he picked it up It was not a bit
afraid neither did the old parent birds who were standing near by
show any sign of fear though they are very timid creatures The Elder
smoothed the young birds feathers a little while and then let it go
but he thought an angel seemed to say to him The quail is a sign you
will know before night what it means and before tomorrow people will be
coming to you to learn the way to God

Soon after a flock of these shy little birds alighted on Joseph
Pelhams house and the Elders were glad and thought it signified the
flock of Believers that would gather in that place for the Shakers see
more in signs than other people Just at night a young girl of twelve
or thirteen knocked at the door and told Elder Calvin that she wanted to
become a Shaker and that her father and mother were willing

Here is the little quail cried the Elder and indeed she was the
first who flocked to the meetings and joined the new Community

On their return to their old home across the state the Elders took
the little quail girl with them It was November then and the canals
through which they traveled were clogged with ice One night having
been ferried across the Mohawk River they took their baggage and walked
for miles before they could find shelter Finally when they were within
three miles of their home Elder Calvin shortened the way by going
across the open fields through the snow up and down the hills and
through the gullies and over fences till they reached the house at
midnight safe and sound the brave little quail girl having trudged
beside them the whole distance carrying her tin pail

Sue was transported with interest her lips parted her eyes shining
her hands clasped Oh I wish I could be a brave little quail girl
Mardie What became of her

Her name was Polly Reed and when she grew up she became a teacher of
the Shaker school then an Eldress and even a preacher I dont know
what kind of a little quail girl you would make Sue do you think you
could walk for miles through the ice and snow uncomplainingly

I don knows I could sighed Sue but she added hopefully
perhaps I could teach or preach and then I could gropeanwag as much
as ever I liked Then after a lengthy pause in which her mind worked
feverishly she said Mardie I was just groping a little bit but I
wont do it any more tonight If the old quail birds in the woods where
Elder Calvin prayed if those old birds had been Shaker birds there
would nt have been any little quail birds would there because Shakers
dont have children and then perhaps there would nt have been any
little Polly Reed

Susanna rose hurriedly from the listbottomed chair and folded her work
Ill go up and help you undress now she said its seven oclock
and I must go to the family meeting




VI Susanna Speaks in Meeting


It was the Sabbath day and the Believers were gathered in the
meetinghouse Brethren and Sisters seated quietly on their separate
benches with the children by themselves in their own place As the men
entered the room they removed their hats and coats and hung them upon
wooden pegs that lined the sides of the room while the women took off
their bonnets then after standing for a moment of perfect silence
they seated themselves

In Susannas time the Sunday costume for the men included trousers of
deep blue cloth with a white line and a vest of darker blue exposing
a fullbosomed shirt that had a wide turneddown collar fastened with
three buttons The Sisters were in pure white dresses with neck and
shoulders covered with snowy kerchiefs their heads crowned with their
white net caps and a large white pocket handkerchief hung over the
left arm Their feet were shod with curious pointedtoed cloth shoes of
ultramarine bluea fashion long since gone by

Susanna had now become accustomed to the curious solemn march or dance
in which of course none but the Believers ever joined and found in
her present exalted mood the songs and the exhortations strangely
interesting and not unprofitable

Tabitha the most aged of the group of Albion Sisters confessed that
she missed the old times when visions were common when the Spirit
manifested itself in extraordinary ways and the gift of tongues
descended Sometimes in the Western Settlement where she was gathered
in the whole North Family would march into the highway in the fresh
morning hours and while singing some sacred hymn would pass on to the
Center Family and together in solemn yet glad procession they would
mount the hillside to Jehovahs Chosen Square there to sing and dance
before the Lord

I wish we could do something like that now sighed Hetty Arnold
a pretty young creature who had moments of longing for the pomps and
vanities If we have to give up all worldly pleasures I think we might
have more religious ones

We were a younger church in those old times of which Sister Tabitha
speaks said Eldress Abby You must remember Hetty that we were
children in faith and needed signs and manifestations pictures and
objectlessons Weve been trained to think and reason now and weve
put away some of our picturebooks There have been revelations to tell
us we needed movements and exercises to quicken our spiritual powers
and to give energy and unity to our worship and there have been
revelations telling us to give them up revelations bidding us to sing
more revelations telling us to use wordless songs Then anthems were
given us and so it has gone on for we have been led of the Spirit

Id like more picturebooks pouted Hetty under her breath

Today the service began with a solemn song followed by speaking and
prayer from a visiting elder Then after a long and profound silence
the company rose and joined in a rhythmic dance which signified the
onward travel of the soul to full redemption the opening and closing of
the hands meaning the scattering and gathering of blessing There was
no accompaniment and both the music and the words were the artless
expression of fervent devotion

Susanna sat in her corner beside the aged Tabitha who would never dance
again before the Lord though her quavering voice joined in the chorus
The spring floor rose and fell under the quick rhythmic tread of the
worshipers and with each revolution about the room the song gained in
power and fervor

 I am never weary bringing my life unto God
 I am never weary singing His way is good
 With the voice of an angel with power from above
 I would publish the blessing of soulsaving love

The steps grew slower and more sedate the voices died away the arms
sank slowly by the sides and the hands ceased their movement

Susanna rose to her feet she knew not how or why Her cheeks were
flushed her head bent

Dear friends she said I have now been among you for nearly three
months sharing your life your work and your worship You may well
wish to know whether I have made up my mind to join this Community and
I can only say that although I have prayed for light I cannot yet see
my way clearly I am happy here with you and although I have been
a church member for years I have never before longed so ardently to
present my body and soul as a sacrifice unto the Lord I have tried not
to be a burden to you The small weekly sum that I put into the treasury
I will not speak of lest I seem to think that the gift of God may be
purchased with money as the Scriptures say but I have endeavored to
be loyal to your rules and customs your aims and ideals and to the
confidence you have reposed in me Oh my dear Sisters and Brothers
pray for me that I be enabled to see my duty more plainly It is not
the fleshpots that will call me back to the world if I go it will be
because the duties I have left behind take such shape that they draw me
out of his shelter in spite of myself I thank you for the help you have
given me these last weeks God knows my gratitude can never be spoken in
words

Elder Grays voice broke the silence that followed Susannas speech
I only echo the sentiments of the Family when I say that our Sister
Susanna shall have such time as she requires before deciding to unite
with this body of Believers No pressure shall be brought to bear upon
her and she will be as she ever has been a welcome guest under our
roof She has been an inspiration to the children a comfort and aid to
the Sisters an intelligent comrade to the Brethren and a sincere and
earnest student of the truth May the Spirit draw her into the Virgin
Church of the New Creation

Yee and amen exclaimed Eldress Abby devoutly For thus saith the
Lord of hosts I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea
and the dry land and I will shake all nations and the desire of all
nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the
Lord of hosts

 O Virgin Church how great the light
 What cloud can dim thy way

sang Martha from her place at the end of a bench and all the voices
took up the hymn softly as the company sat with bowed heads

Then Brother Issachar rose from his corner saying Jesus called upon
his disciples to give up everything houses lands relationships and
even the selfishness of their own lives They could not call their
lives their own Lo we have left all and followed thee said Peter
fathers mothers wives children houses lands and even our own
lives also It is a great price to pay but we buy Heaven with it

Yee we do said Brother Thomas Scattergood devoutly To him that
overcometh shall the great prize be given

God help the weaker brethren murmured young Brother Nathan in so
low a voice that few could hear him Moved by the same impulse Tabitha
Abby and Martha burst into one of the most triumphant of the Shaker
songs one that was never sung save when the meeting was full of the
Spirit

 I draw no blank nor miss the prize
 I see the work the sacrifice
 And Ill be loyal Ill be wise A faithful overcomer

The company rose and began again to march in a circle around the center
of the room the Brethren two abreast leading the column the Sisters
following after There was a waving movement of the hands by drawing
inward as if gathering in spiritual good and storing it up for future
need In the marching and countermarching the worshipers frequently
changed their positions ultimately forming into four circles
symbolical of the four dispensations as expounded in Shakerism the
first from Adam to Abraham the second from Abraham to Jesus the third
from Jesus to Mother Ann Lee and the fourth the millennial era

The marching grew livelier the bodies of the singers swayed lightly
with emotion the faces glowed with feeling

Over and over the hymn was sung gathering strength and fullness as
the Believers entered more and more into the spirit of their worship
Whenever the refrain came in with its militant fervor crude but
sincere and effective the singers seemed faithintoxicated and Sister
Martha in particular might have been treading the heavenly streets
instead of the meetinghouse floor so complete was her absorption The
voices at length grew softer and the movement slower and after a few
moments reverent silence the company filed out of the room solemnly and
without speech

 I am as sure that heavn is mine
 As though my vision could define
 Or pencil draw the boundary line
 Where love and truth shall conquer

The Lord aint shaken Susanna hard enough yet thought Brother Ansel
shrewdly from his place in the rear She aint altogether gathered
in not by no manner o means because of that unregenerate son of Adam
shes left behind but theres the makins of a powful good Shaker in
Susanna if she finally takes holt

What manner of life is my husband living now that I have deserted him
Who is being a mother to Jack These were the thoughts that troubled
Susanna Hathaways soul as she crossed the grass to her own building




VII The Lower Plane


Brother Nathan Bennett was twenty years old and Sister Hetty Arnold
was eighteen They had been left with the Shakers by their respective
parents ten years before and growing up in the faith they formally
joined the Community when they reached the age of discretion Thus they
had known each other from early childhood never in the familiar way
common to the children of the world but with the cool cheerful
casual wholly impersonal attitude of Shaker friendship a relation
seemingly outside of and superior to sex a relation more like that of
two astral bodies than the more intimate one of a budding Adam and Eve

When and where had this relationship changed its color and meaning
Neither Nathan nor Hetty could have told For years Nathan had sat at
his end of the young mens bench at the family or the public meeting
with Hetty exactly opposite him at the end of the girls row and for
years they had looked across the dividing space at each other with
unstirred pulses The rows of Sisters sat in serene dignity one bench
behind another and each Sister was like unto every other in Nathans
vague dreamy boyishly indifferent eyes Some of them were seventy
and some seventeen but each modest figure sat in its place with quiet
folded hands The stiff caps hid the hair whether it was silver or
gold the white surplices covered the shoulders and concealed beautiful
curves as well as angular outlines the throats were scarcely visible
whether they were yellow and wrinkled or young and white The Sisters
were simply sisters to fairhaired Nathan and the Brothers were but
brothers to little blackeyed Hetty

Oncewas it on a Sunday morningNathan glanced across the separating
space that is the very essence and sign of Shakerism The dance had just
ceased and there was a long solemn stillness when God indeed seemed to
be in one of His holy temples and the earth was keeping silence before
Him Suddenly Hetty grew to be something more than one of the figures in
a long row she chained Nathans eye and held it

Through her garments the grace of her glowed He saw that in spite
of the way her hair had been cut and stretched back from the forehead
a short dusky tendril softened and coaxed by the summer heat had made
its way mutinously beyond the confines of her cap Her eyes were
cast down but the lashes that swept her round young cheek were quite
different from any other lashes in the Sisters row Her breath came and
went softly after the exertion of the rhythmic movements stirring the
white muslin folds that wrapped her from throat to waist He looked and
looked until his body seemed to be all eyes absolutely unaware of any
change in himself quite oblivious of the fact that he was regarding the
girl in any new and dangerous way

The silence continued long and profound until suddenly Hetty raised
her beautiful lashes and met Nathans gaze the gaze of a boy just
turned to man ardent warm compelling There was a startled moment of
recognition a tremulous approach almost an embrace of regard each
sent an electric current across the protective separating space the
two pairs of eyes met and said I love you in such clear tones that
Nathan and Hetty marveled that the Elder did not hear them Somebody
says that love like a scarlet spider can spin a thread between two
hearts almost in an instant so fine as to be almost invisible yet it
will hold with the tenacity of an iron chain The thread had been spun
it was so delicate that neither Nathan nor Hetty had seen the scarlet
spider spinning it but the strength of both would not avail to snap the
bond that held them together

The moments passed Hettys kerchief rose and fell rose and fell
tumultuously while her face was suffused with color Nathans knees
quivered under him and when the Elder rose and they began the sacred
march the lad could hardly stand for trembling He dreaded the moment
when the lines of Believers would meet and he and Hetty would walk the
length of the long room almost beside each other Could she hear his
heart beating Nathan wondered while Hetty was palpitating with fear
lest Nathan see her blushes and divine their meaning Oh the joy of it
the terror of it the strange exhilaration and the sudden sensation of
sin and remorse

The meeting over Nathan flung himself on the haymow in the great barn
while Hetty sat with her Synopsis of Shaker Theology at an open window
of the girls building seeing nothing in the lines of print but
visions that should not have been there It was Nathan who felt most
and suffered most and was most conscious of sin for Hetty at first
scarcely knew whither she was drifting

She went into the herbgarden with Susanna one morning during the
week that followed the fatal Sunday Many of the plants to be used for
seasoningsage summer savory sweet marjoram and the likewere quite
ready for gathering As the two women were busy at work Susanna as full
of her thoughts as Hetty of hers the sound of a step was heard brushing
the grass of the orchard Hetty gave a nervous start her cheeks grew so
crimson and her breath so short that Susanna noticed the change

It will be Brother Ansel coming along to the grindstone Hetty
stammered burying her head in the leaves

No Susanna answered it is Nathan He has a long pole with a saw on
the end He must be going to take the dead branches off the apple trees
I heard Ansel tell him yesterday to do it

Yee that will be it said Hetty bending over the plants as if she
were afraid to look elsewhere

Nathan came nearer to the herbgarden He was a tall stalwart handsome
enough fellow even in his quaint working garb As the Sisters spun and
wove the cloth as well as cut and made the mens garments and as the
Brothers themselves made the shoes there was naturally no great air
of fashion about the Shaker raiment but Nathan carried it better than
most His skin was fair and rosy the down on his upper lip showed
dawning manhood and when he took off his broadbrimmed straw hat and
stretched to his full height to reach the upper branches of the apple
trees he made a picture of clean wholesome vigorous youth

Suddenly Susanna raised her head and surprised Hetty looking at the lad
with all her heart in her eyes At the same moment Nathan turned and
before he could conceal the telltale ardor of his glance it had sped to
Hetty With the instinct of selfpreservation he stooped instantly as if
to steady the saw on the pole but it was too late to mend matters his
tale was told so far as Susanna was concerned but it was better she
should suspect than one of the Believers or Eldress Abby

Susanna worked on in silent anxiety The likelihood of such crises as
this had sometimes crossed her mind and knowing how frail human nature
is she often marveled that instances seemed so infrequent Her instinct
told her that in every Community the risk must exist even though all
were doubly warned and armed against the temptations that flesh is heir
to yet no hint of danger had showed itself during the months in which
she had been a member of the Shaker family She had heard the Elders
plea to the young converts to take up a full cross against the flesh
she had listened to Eldress Abby when she told them that the natural
life its thoughts passions feelings and associations must be turned
against once and forever but her heart melted in pity for the two
poor young things struggling helplessly against instincts of which they
hardly knew the meaning so cloistered had been the life they lived
The kind conscientious hands that had fed them would now seem hard and
unrelenting the place that had been home would turn to a prison the
life that Elder Gray preached the life of a purer godliness than can
be attained by marriage had seemed difficult perhaps but possible
and now how cold and hopeless it would appear to these two young
undisciplined flaming hearts

Hetty dear talk to me whispered Susanna softly touching her
shoulder and wondering if she could somehow find a way to counsel the
girl in her perplexity

Hetty started rebelliously to her feet as Nathan moved away farther into
the orchard If you say a single thing to me or a word about me to
Eldress Abby Ill run away this very day Nobody has any right to speak
to me and I just want to be let alone Its all very well for you
she went on passionately What have you had to give up Nothing but a
husband you did nt love and a home you did nt want to stay in Like
as not youll be a Shaker and theyll take you for a saint but anyway
youll have had your life

You are right Hetty said Susanna quietly but oh my dear the
world outside isnt such a Paradise for young girls like you motherless
and fatherless and penniless You have a good home here cant you learn
to like it

Out in the world people can do as they like and nobody thinks of
calling them wicked sobbed Hetty flinging herself down and putting
her head in Susannas aproned lap Here youve got to live like an
angel and if you dont youve got to confess every wrong thought
youve had when the time comes

Whatever you do Hetty be open and aboveboard dont be hasty and
foolish or you may be sorry forever afterwards

Hettys mood changed again suddenly to one of mutiny and she rose to
her feet

You have nt got any right to interfere with me anyway Susanna and if
you think its your duty to tell tales youll only make matters worse
and so saying she took her basket and fled across the fields like a
hunted hare

That evening as Hetty left the infirmary where she had been sent
with a bottle of liniment for the nursing Sisters she came upon Nathan
standing gloomily under the spruce trees near the back of the building
It was eight oclock and quite dark It had been raining during the late
afternoon and the trees were still dripping drearily Hetty came upon
Nathan so suddenly that although he had been in her thoughts she gave
a frightened little cry when he drew her peremptorily under the shadow
of the branches The rules that govern the Shaker Community are very
strict but in reality the true Believer never thinks of them as rules
nor is trammeled by them They are fixed habits of the blood as common
as natural as sitting or standing eating or drinking No Brother is
allowed to hold any lengthy interview with a Sister nor to work walk
or drive with her alone but these protective customs which all are
bound in honor to keep are too much a matter of everyday life to be
strange or irksome

I must speak to you Hetty whispered Nathan I cannot bear it any
longer alone What shall we do

Do echoed Hetty trembling

Yes _do_ There was no pretense of asking her if she loved or
suffered or lived in torture and suspense They had not uttered a word
to each other but their eyes had shed meanings

You know we cant go on like this he continued rapidly We cant eat
their food stay alongside of them pray their prayers and act a lie all
the time we cant

Nay we cant said Hetty Oh Nathan shall we confess all and see
if they will help us to resist temptation I know thats what Susanna
would want me to do but oh I should dread it

Nay it is too late Nathan answered drearily They could not help
us and we should be held under suspicion forever after

I feel so wicked and miserable and unfaithful I dont know what to
do sobbed Hetty

Yee so do I the lad answered And I feel bitter against my father
too He brought me here to get rid of me because he did nt dare leave
me on somebodys doorstep He ought to have come back when I was grown
a man and asked me if I felt inclined to be a Shaker and if I was good
enough to be one

And my stepfather would nt have me in the house so my mother had to
give me away but theyre both dead and Im alone in the world though
Ive never felt it because the Sisters are so kind Now they will hate
methough they dont hate anybody

Youve got me Hetty We must go away and be married Wed better go
tonight to the minister in Albion

What if he would nt do it

Why should nt he Shakers take no vows though I feel bound hand and
foot out of gratitude If any other two young folks went to him he
would marry them and if he refuses there are two other ministers in
Albion besides two more in Buryfield five miles farther If they wont
marry us tonight Ill leave you in some safe home and we ll walk
to Portland tomorrow Im young and strong and I know I can earn our
living somehow

But we have nt the price of a lodging or a breakfast between us
Hetty said tearfully Would it be sinful to take some of my basketwork
and send back the money next week

Yee it would be so Nathan answered sternly The least we can do is
to go away as emptyhanded as we came I can work for our breakfast

Oh I cant bear to disappoint Eldress Abby cried Hetty breaking
anew into tears Shell say weve run away to live on the lower plane
after agreeing to crucify Nature and follow the angelic life

I know but there are five hundred people in Albion all living in
marriage and we shant be the only sinners Nathan argued Oh Sister
Hetty dear Hetty keep up your spirits and trust to me

Nathans hand stole out and met Hettys in its warm clasp the first
hand touch that the two ignorant young creatures had ever felt Nathans
knowledge of life had been a journey to the Canterbury Shakers in New
Hampshire with Brother Issachar Hettys was limited to a few drives
into Albion village and half a dozen chats with the worlds people who
came to the Settlement to buy basketwork

I am not able to bear the Shaker life sighed Nathan Elder Gray
allows there be such

Nor I murmured Hetty Eldress Harriet knows I am no saint

Hettys head was now on Nathans shoulder The stiff Shaker cap
had resisted bravely but the girls head had yielded to the sweet
proximity Youth called to youth triumphantly the Spirit was unheard
and all the theories of celibacy and the angelic life that had been
poured into their ears vanished into thin air The thick shade of the
spruce tree hid the kiss that would have been so innocent had they
not given themselves to the Virgin Church the drip drip drip of the
branches on their young heads passed unheeded

Then one following the other silently along the highroad hurrying
along in the shadows of the tall trees stealing into the edge of the
woods or hiding behind a thicket of alders at the fancied sound of a
footstep or the distant rumble of a wagon Nathan and Hetty forsook the
faith of Mother Ann and went out into the world as Adam and Eve left the
garden with the knowledge of good and evil implanted in their hearts
The voice of Eldress Abby pursued Hetty in her flight like the voice
in a dream She could hear its clear impassioned accents saying The
children of this world marry but the children of the resurrection do
not marry for they are as the angels The solemn tones grew fainter
and fainter as Hettys steps led her farther and farther away from the
quiet Shaker village and its drabclad Sisters and at last they almost
died into silence because Nathans voice was nearer and Nathans voice
was dearer




VIII Concerning Backsliders


There was no work in the herbgarden now but there was never a moment
from dawn till long after dusk when the busy fingers of the Shaker
Sisters were still When all else failed there was the knitting socks
for the Brothers and stockings for the Sisters and socks and stockings
of every size for the children One of the quaint sights of the
Settlement to Susanna was the clump of young Sisters on the porch of the
girls building knitting knitting in the afternoon sun Even little
Shaker Jane and Mary Maria and Lucinda had their socks in hand and
plied their short knittingneedles soberly and not unskillfully The
sight of their industry incited the impetuous Sue to effort and under
the patient tutelage of Sister Martha she mastered the gentle art
Susanna never forgot the hour when coming from her work in the
seedroom she crossed the grass with a message to Martha and saw the
group of children and girls on the western porch a place that caught
every ray of afternoon sun the last glint of twilight and the first
hint of sunset glow Sister Martha had been reading the SabbathSchool
lesson for the next day and as Susanna neared the building Marthas
voice broke into a hymn Falteringly the girls voices followed the
lead uncertain at first of words or tune but gaining courage and
strength as they went on

 As the waves of the mighty ocean
 Gospel love we will circulate
 And as we give in due proportion
 We of the heavenly life partake
 Heavenly Life Glorious Life
 Resurrecting SoulInspiring
 Regenerating Gospel Life
 It leadeth away from all sin and strife

The clear innocent treble sounded sweetly in the virgin stillness and
solitude of the Settlement and as Susanna drew closer she stopped
under a tree to catch the pictureSister Martha grave tall discreet
singing with all her soul and marking time with her hands so accustomed
to the upward and downward movement of the daily service The straight
plain dresses were as fresh and smooth as perfect washing could make
them and the round childlike faces looked quaint and sweet with the
cropped hair tucked under the stiff little caps Sue was seated with
Mary and Jane on the steps and Susanna saw with astonishment that her
needles were moving to and fro and she was knitting as serenely and
correctly as a mother in Israel singing too in a delicate little
treble that was like a skylarks morning note Susanna could hear her
distinctly as she delightedly flung out the long words so dear to her
soul and so difficult to dull little Jane and Mary

 Resurrecting SoulInspiring
 Regenerating Gospel Life
 It leadeth away from all sin and strife

Janes cap was slightly unsettled causing its wearer to stop knitting
now and then and pull it forward or push it back and in one of these
little feminine difficulties Susanna saw Sue reach forward and deftly
transfer the cap to her own head Jane was horrified but rather slow to
wrath and equally slow in ingenuity Sue looked a delicious Shaker with
her delicate face her lovely eyes and her yellow hair grown into soft
rings and quite intoxicated with her cap her knitting and the general
air of holiness so unexpectedly emanating from her she moved her little
hands up and down as the tune rose and fell in a way that would
have filled Eldress Abby with joy Susannas heart beat fast and she
wondered for a moment as she went back to her room whether she could
ever give Sue a worldly childhood more free from danger than the life
she was now living She found letters from Aunt Louisa and Jack on
reaching her room and they lay in her lap under a pile of towels to
be read and reread while her busy needle flew over the coarse crash Sue
stole in quietly kissed her mothers cheek and sat down on her stool
by the window marveling with every under of the needle and over of
the yarn that it was she Sue Hathaway who was making a real stocking

Jacks pen was not that of an especially ready writer but he had a
practical way of conveying considerable news His present contributions
when freed from their phonetic errors and spelled in Christian fashion
read somewhat as follows

Father says I must write to you every week even if I make him do
without so I will I am well and so is Aunt Louisa and any boy that
lives with her has to toe the mark I tell you but she is good and has
fine things to eat every meal What did Sue get for her birthday I got
a book from father and one from Aunt Louisa and the one from you that
you told her to buy It is queer that people will give a boy books when
he has only one knife and that a broken one Theres a book prize to
be given at the school and I am pretty afraid I will get that too it
would be just my luck Teachers think about nothing but books and what
good they do but I heard of a boy that had a grand knife with five
sharp blades and a corkscrew and in a shipwreck he cut all the ropes
so the sail came down that was carrying them on to the rocks and then
by boring a hole with his corkscrew all the water leaked out of the
ship that had been threatening to sink the sailors I could use a little
pocket money as Aunt Louisa keeps me short  I have been spending
Sunday with father and had a pretty good time not so very Father will
take me about more when he stops going to the store which will be
next week for good The kitchen floor is new painted and Ellen says it
sticks and Aunt Louisa is going to make Ellen clean house in case
you come home Do you like where you are Our teacher told the girls
teacher it seemed a long stay for any one who had a family and the boys
at school call me a half orphan and say my mother has left me and so my
father has to board me in the country My money is run out again I sat
down in a puddle this afternoon but it dried up pretty quick and
did nt hurt my clothes so no more from your son

JACK


This was the sort of message that had been coming to Susanna of late
bringing up little pictures of home duties and responsibilities homely
tasks and trials John giving up the store for good what did that
mean Had he gone from bad to worse in the solitude that she had hoped
might show him the gravity of his offenses the error of his ways
In case she should die what then would become of the children Would
Louisa accept the burden of Jack for whom she had never cared Would
the Shakers take Sue She would be safe perhaps she would always
be happy but brother and sister would be divided and brought up as
strangers Would little Sue grown to big Sue say some time or other
My mother renounced the world for herself but what right had she to
renounce it for me Why did she rob me of the dreams of girlhood and the
natural hopes of women when I was too young to give consent These and
other unanswerable questions continually drifted through Susannas mind
disturbing its balance and leaving her like a shuttlecock bandied to and
fro between conflicting blows

Mardie came a soft little voice from across the room Mardie what
is a backslider

Where did you hear that long word Sue asked Susanna rousing herself
from her dream

T is nt so long as regenerating and more easier

Regenerating means making over you know

Thered ought to be childrens words and grownup wordsthats what I
think said Sue decisively but what does backslider mean

A backslider is one who has been climbing up a hill and suddenly begins
to slip back

Does nt his feet take hold right or why does he slip

Perhaps he cant manage his feetperhaps they just wont climb 295

Yes or praps he just does nt want to climb any more but it must be
frightensome sliding backwards

I suppose it is

Is it wicked

Why yes it is generally perhaps always

Brother Nathan and Sister Hetty were backsliders Sister Tabitha said
so She told Jane never to speak their names again any more than if they
was dead

Then you had better not speak of them either

Theres so many things better not to speak of in the world sometimes I
think t would be nicer to be an angel

Nicer perhaps but one has to be very good to be an angel

Backsliders could nt be angels I spose

Not while they were backsliders but perhaps theyd begin to climb
again and then in time they might grow to be angels

I should nt think likely remarked Sue decisively clicking her
needles as one who could settle most spiritual problems in a jiffy I
think the sliding kind is diffrent from the climbing kind and they
dont make easy angels

A long pause followed this expression of opinion this simple division
of the human race at the start into sheep and goats Then presently
the untiring voice broke the stillness again

Nathan and Hetty slid back when they went away from here Did we
backslide when we left Fardie and Jack

Im not sure but that we did said poor Susanna

Theres childrenShakers and brotherandsister Shakers but no
fatherandmother Shakers

No they think they can do just as much good in the world without being
mothers and fathers

Do you think so

Yees I believe I do

Well are you a truly Shaker or cant you be till you wear a cap

Im not a Shaker yet Sue

Youre just only a mother

Yes thats about all

Maybe wed better go back to where theres not so many Sisters and more
mothers so you ll have somebody to climb togedder with

I could climb here Sue and so could you

Yes but wholl Fardie and Jack climb with I wish theyd come and see
us Brother Ansel would make Fardie laugh and Jack would love farmwork
and wed all be so happy I miss Fardie awfully He did nt speak to
me much but I liked to look at his curly hair and think how lovely it
would be if he did take notice of me and play with me

A sob from Susanna brought Sue startled to her side

You break my heart Sue You break it every day with the things you
say Dont you love me Sue

Moren tongue can tell cried Sue throwing herself into her mothers
arms Dont cry darling Mardie I wont talk any more not for days
and days Let me wipe your poor eyes Dont let Elder Gray see you
crying or hell think Ive been naughty Hes just going in downstairs
to see Eldress Abby Was it wrong what I said about backsliding or
what Mardie Well help each udder climb an then well go home an
help poor lonesome Fardie shall we


Abby called Elder Gray stepping into the entry of the Office
Building

Yee Im coming Eldress Abby answered from the stairway Go right
out and sit down on the bench by the door where I can catch a few
minutes more light for my darning the days seem to be growing
short all to once Did Lemuel have a good sale of basketwork at the
mountains Rosetta has nt done so well for years at Old Orchard We
seem to be prospering in every material direction Daniel but my
heart is heavy somehow and I have to be instant in prayer to keep from
discouragement

It has nt been an altogether good year with us spiritually confessed
Daniel perhaps we needed chastening

If we needed it weve received it Abby ejaculated as she pushed her
darningball into the foot of a stocking Nothing has happened since I
came here thirty years ago that has troubled me like the running away of
Nathan and Hetty If they had been new converts we should have thought
the good seed had nt got fairly rooted but those children were brought
to us when Nathan was eleven and Hetty nine

I well remember for the boys father and the girls mother came on
the same train a most unusual occurrence to receive two children in one
day

I have cause to remember Hetty in her first month for she was as wild
as a young hawk She laughed in meeting the first Sunclay and when she
came back I told her to sit behind me in silence for half an hour while
I was reading my Bible Be still now Hetty and labor to repent I
said When the time was up she said in a meek little mite of a
voice I think Im least in the Kingdom now Eldress Abby Then run
outdoors I said She kicked up her heels like a colt and was through
the door in a second Not long afterwards I put my hands behind me to
tie my apron tighter and if that child had nt taken my small scissors
lying on the table and cut buttonholes all up and down my strings
hundreds of them while she was laboring to repent

Elder Gray smiled reminiscently though he had often heard the story
before Neither of the children came from godly families he said
but at least the parents never interfered with us nor came here putting
false ideas into their childrens heads

Thats what I say continued Abby and now after ten years training
and discipline in the angelic life Hetty being especially promising
to think of their going away together and worse yet being married in
Albion village right at our very doors I dont hardly dare to go to bed
nights for fear of hearing in the morning that some of the other young
folks have been led astray by this foolish performance of Hettys I
know it was Hettys fault Nathan never had ingenuity enough to think
and plan it all out

Nay nay Abby dont be too hard on the girl Ive watched Nathan
closely and he has been in a dangerous and unstable state even as long
ago as his last confession but this piece of backsliding grievous as
it is does nt cause me as much sorrow as the fall of Brother Ephraim
To all appearance he had conquered his appetite and for five years he
has led a sober life I had even great hopes of him for the ministry
and suddenly like a great cloud in the blue sky has come this terrible
visitation this reappearance of the old Adam Ephraim has returned to
his idols

How have you decided to deal with him Daniel

It is his first offense since he cast in his lot with us we must
rebuke chastise and forgive

Yee yee I agree to that but how if he makes us the laughingstock of
the community and drags our sacred banner in the dust We cant afford
to have one of our order picked up in the streets by the worlds
people

Have the worlds people found an infallible way to keep those of their
order out of the gutters asked Elder Gray Ephraim seems repentant
if he is willing to try again we must be willing to do as much

Yee Daniel you are right Another matter that causes me anxiety is
Susanna I never yearned for a soul as I yearn for hers She has had the
advantage of more education and more reading than most of us have ever
enjoyed shes gifted in teaching and she wins the children Shes
discreet and spiritually minded her life in the world even with
the influence of her dissipated husband has nt really stained only
humbled her she would make such a Shaker if she was once convinced
as we have nt gathered in for years and years but I fear shes
slipping slipping away Daniel

What makes you feel so now particularly

Shes diffrent as time goes on Shes had more letters from that place
where her boy is she cries nights and though she does nt relax a mite
with her work she drags about sometimes like a bird with one wing

Elder Daniel took off his broadbrimmed hat to cool his forehead and
hair lifting his eyes to the first pale stars that were trembling in
the sky hesitating in silver and then quietly deepening into gold

Brother Ansel was a Believer because he had no particular love for the
world and no great susceptibility to its temptations but what had drawn
Daniel Gray from the open sea into this quiet little backwater of a
Shaker Settlement After an adventurous early life in which as if
youthintoxicated he had plunged from danger to danger experience to
experience he suddenly found himself in a society of which he had never
so much as heard a company of celibate brothers and sisters holding all
goods and possessions in common and trying to live the angelic life
on earth Illness detained him for a month against his will but at the
end of that time he had joined the Community and although it had been
twentyfive years since his gathering in he was still steadfast in the
faith

His character was of puritanical sternness he was a strict
disciplinarian and insisted upon obedience to the rules of Shaker life
the sacred laws of Zion as he was wont to term them He magnified
his office yet he was of a kindly disposition easily approached by
children and not without a quaint oldtime humor

There was a long pause while the two faithful leaders of the little
flock were absorbed in thought then the Elder said Susannas all you
say and the child well if she could be purged of her dross I never
saw a creature better fitted to live the celestial life but we must not
harbor any divided hearts here When the time comes we must dismiss her
with our blessing

Yee I suppose so said Eldress Abby loyally but it was with a sigh
Had she and Tabitha been left to their own instincts they would have
gone out into the highways and hedges proselyting with the fervor of
Mother Anns day and generation

After all Abby said the Elder rising to take his leave still in
a sort of mild trance after all Abby I suppose the Shakers dont
own the whole of heaven Id like to think so but I cant Its a big
place and it belongs to God




IX Love Manifold


The woods on the shores of Massabesic Pond were stretches of tapestry
where every shade of green and gold olive and brown orange and
scarlet melted the one into the other The somber pines made a
deeptoned background patches of sumach gave their flaming crimson
the goldenrod grew rank and tall in glorious profusion and the maples
outside the Office Building were balls of brilliant carmine The air was
like crystal and the landscape might have been bathed in liquid amber
it was so saturated with October yellow

Susanna caught her breath as she threw her chamber window wider open in
the early morning for the greater part of the picture had been painted
during the frosty night

Throw your little cape round your shoulders and come quickly Sue she
exclaimed

The child ran to her side Oh what a goldy goldy morning she cried

One crimson leaf with a long heavy stem that acted as a sort of rudder
came down to the windowsill with a sidelong scooping flight while two
or three gayly painted ones parted from the tree by the same breeze
floated airily along as if borne on unseen wings finally alighting on
Sues head and shoulders like tropical birds

You cried in the night Mardie said Sue I heard you snifferling
and getting up for your hankchief but I did nt speak cause its so
dreadful to be _catched_ crying

Kneel down beside me and give me part of your cape her mother
answered Im going to let my sad heart fly right out of the window
into those beautiful trees

And maybe a glad heart will fly right in the child suggested

Maybe Oh we must cuddle close and be still Elder Grays going to sit
down under the great maple and do you see all the Brothers seem to be
up early this morning just as we are

More love Elder Gray called Issachar on his way to the toolhouse

More love Brother Issachar

More love Brother Ansel

More love Brother Calvin

More love More love More love So the quaint but not
uncommon Shaker greeting passed from Brother to Brother and as Tabitha
and Martha and Rosetta met on their way to dairy and laundry and
seedhouse they too hearing the salutation took up the refrain
and Susanna and Sue heard again from the womens voices that beautiful
morning wish More love More love speeding from heart to heart and
lip to lip

Mother and child were very quiet

More love Sue said Susanna clasping her closely

More love Mardie whispered the child smiling and entering into the
spirit of the salutation Lets turn our heads Farnham way Ill take
Jack and you take Fardie and well say togedder More love shall
we

More love John

More love Jack

The words floated out over the trees in the womans trembling voice and
the childs treble

Elder Gray looks tired though hes just got up Sue continued

He is not strong replied her mother remembering Brother Ansels
statement that the Elder want diseased anywheres but did nt have no
durability

The Elder would have a lovely lap Sue remarked presently

_What_

A nice lap to sit in Fardie has a nice lap too and Uncle Joel
Atterbury but not Aunt Louisa she lets you slide right off its a
bony hard lap I love Elder Gray and I climbed on his lap one day He
put me right down but Im sure he likes children I wish I could take
right hold of his hand and walk all over the farm but he would nt let
me I spose _More love Elder Gray_ she cried suddenly bobbing
up above the windowsill and shaking her fairy hand at him

The Elder looked up at the sound of the glad voice No human creature
could have failed to smile back into the roguish face or have treated
churlishly the sweet confident little greeting The heart of a real man
must have an occasional throb of the father and when Daniel Gray rose
from his seat under the maple and called More love child there was
something strange and touching in his tone He moved away from the
tree to his morning labors with the consciousness of something new
to conquer Long long ago he had risen victorious above many of the
temptations that flesh is heir to Women were his good friends his
comrades his sisters they no longer troubled the waters of his soul
but here was a child who stirred the depths who awakened the potential
father in him so suddenly and so strongly that he longed for the
sweetness of a human tie that could bind him to her But the current of
the Elders being was set towards sacrifice and holiness and the common
joys of human life he felt could never and must never be his so he
went to the daily round the common task only a little paler a little
soberer than was his wont

More love Martha said Susanna when she met Martha a little later in
the day

More love Susanna Martha replied cheerily You heard our Shaker
greeting I see It was the beautiful weather the fine air and glorious
colors that brought the inspiration this morning I guess It took us
all out of doors and then it seemed to get into the blood Besides
tomorrows the Day of Sacrifice and that takes us all on to the
mountaintops of feeling There have been times when I had to own up to a
lack of love

You Martha who have such wonderful influence over the children such
patience such affection

It was nt always so When I was first put in charge of the children I
did nt like the work They did nt respond to me somehow and when they
were out of my sight they were ugly and disobedient My natural mother
Maria Holmes took care of the girls clothing One day she said to me
Martha do you love the girls

Some of them are very unlovely I replied

I know that she said but you can never help them unless you love
them

I thought mother very critical for I strove scrupulously to do my
duty A few days after this the Elder said to me Martha do you love
the girls I responded Not very much

You cannot save them unless you love them he said Then I answered
I will labor for a gift of love

When the work of the day was over and the girls were in bed I would
take off my shoes and spend several hours of the night walking the
floor kneeling in prayer that I might obtain the coveted gift For five
weeks I did this without avail when suddenly one night when the moon
was full and I was kneeling by the window a glory seemed to overshadow
the crest of a high mountain in the distance I thought I heard a voice
say _Martha I baptize you into the spirit of love_ I sat there
trembling for more than an hour and when I rose I felt that I could
love the meanest human being that ever walked the earth I have never
had any trouble with children since that night of the vision They seem
different to me and I dare say I am different to them

I wish I could see visions exclaimed Susanna Oh for a glory
that would speak to me and teach me truth and duty Life is all mist
whichever way I turn Id like to be lifted on to a high place where I
could see clearly

She leaned against the frame of the open kitchen door her delicate
face quivering with emotion and longing her attitude simplicity and
unconsciousness itself The baldest of Shaker prose turned to purest
poetry when Susanna dipped it in the alembic of her own imagination

Labor for the gift of sight said Martha who believed implicitly in
spirits and visions Labor this very night

It must be said for Susanna that she had never ceased laboring in her
own way for many days The truth was that she felt herself turning from
marriage She had lived now so long in the society of men and women who
regarded it as an institution not compatible with the highest spiritual
development that unconsciously her point of view had changed changed
all the more because she had been so unhappy with the man she had
chosen Curiously enough and unfortunately enough for Susanna
Hathaways peace of mind the greater aversion she felt towards the
burden of the old life towards the irksomeness of guiding a weaker
soul towards the claims of husband on wife the stronger those claims
appeared If they had never been assumedAh but they had there was
the rub One sight of little Sue sleeping tranquilly beside her one
memory of rebellious faulty Jack one vision of John either as needing
or missing her the rightful woman or falling deeper in the wiles of
the wrong one for very helplessnessany of these changed Susanna the
wouldbe saint in an instant into Susanna the wife and mother

_Speak to me for Thy Compassions sake_ she prayed from the little
book of Confessions that her mother had given her _I will follow after
Thy Voice_

Would you betray your trust asked conscience

No not intentionally

Would you desert your post

Never willingly

You have divided the family taken a little quail bird out of the
homenest and left sorrow behind you Would God justify you in that

For the first time Susannas No rang clearly enough for her to hear it
plainly for the first time it was followed by no vague misgivings no
bewilderment no unrest or indecision _I turn hither and hither Thy
purposes are hid from me but I commend my soul to Thee_

Then a sentence from the dear old book came into her memory _And thy
dead things shall revive and thy weak things shall be made whole_

She listened laying hold of every word till the nervous clenching
of her hands subsided her face relaxed into peace Then she lay down
beside Sue creeping close to her for the warmth and comfort and healing
of her innocent touch and closing her eyes serenely knew no more till
the morning broke the Sabbath morning of Confession Day





X Brother and Sister


If Susannas path had grown more difficult more filled with anxieties
so had John Hathaways The protracted absence of his wife made the
gossips conclude that the break was a final one Jack was only half
contented with his aunt and would be fairly mutinous in the winter
while Louisas general attitude was such as to show clearly that she
only kept the boy for Susannas sake

Now and then there was a terrifying hint of winter in the air and the
days of Susannas absence seemed eternal to John Hathaway Yet he was a
man about whom there would have been but one opinion that when deprived
of a rather superior and highminded wife and the steadying influence
of home and children he would go completely to the dogs whither he
seemed to be hurrying when Susannas wifely courage failed That he had
done precisely the opposite and the unexpected thing shows us perhaps
that men are not on the whole as capable of estimating the forces
of their fellow men as is God the maker of men who probably expects
something of the worst of them up to the very last

It was at the end of a hopeless Sunday when John took his boy back to
his aunts towards night He wondered drearily how a woman dealt with a
tenyearold boy who from sunrise to sunset had done every mortal thing
he ought not to have done and had left undone everything that he had
been told to do and as if to carry out the very words of the church
service neither was there any health in him for he had an inflamed
throat and a whining irritable discontented temper that could be borne
only by a mother a father being wholly inadequate and apparently never
destined for the purpose

It was a mild evening late in October and Louisa sat on the porch with
her pepperandsalt shawl on and a black wool rigolette tied over her
head Jack very sulky and unresigned was dispatched to bed under the
care of the one servant who was provided with a cupful of vinegar
salt and water for a gargle John had more than an hour to wait for
a returning train to Farnham and although ordinarily he would have
preferred to spend the time in the silent and unreproachful cemetery
rather than in the society of his sister Louisa he was too tired and
hopeless to do anything but sit on the steps and smoke fitfully in the
semidarkness Louisa was much as usual She well knewwho betterher
brothers changed course of life but neither encouragement nor
compliment were in her line Why should a man be praised for living a
respectable life That John had really turned a sort of moral somersault
and come up a different creature she did not realize in the least nor
the difficulties surmounted in such a feat but she did give him credit
secretly for turning about face and behaving far more decently than she
could ever have believed possible She had no conception of his mental
torture at the time but if he kept on doing well she privately
intended to inform Susanna and at least give her a chance of trying him
again if absence had diminished her sense of injury One thing that
she did not know was that John was on the eve of losing his partnership
When Jack had said that his father was not going back to the store
the next week she thought it meant simply a vacation Divided hearts
broken vows ruined lives she could bear the sight of these with
considerable philosophy but a lost income was a very different a very
tangible thing She almost lost her breath when her brother knocked the
ashes from his meerschaum and curtly told her of the proposed change in
his business relations

I dont know what I shall do yet he said whether I shall set up for
myself in a small way or take a position in another concernthat is
if I can get onemy stock of popularity seems to be pretty low just now
in Farnham Id move away tomorrow and cut the whole gossipy deceitful
hypocritical lot of em if I was nt afraid of closing the house and so
losing Susanna if she should ever feel like coming back to us

These words and the thought back of them were too much for Johns
selfcontrol The darkness helped him and his need of comfort was
abject Suddenly he burst out Oh Louisa for heavens sake give me a
little crumb of comfort if you have any How can you stand like a stone
all these months and see a man suffering as I have suffered without
giving him a word

You brought it on yourself said Louisa in selfexculpation

Does that make it any easier to bear cried John Dont you suppose
I remember it every hour and curse myself the more You know perfectly
well that Im a different man today I dont know what made me change
it was as if something had been injected into my blood that turned me
against everything I had liked best before I hate the sight of the men
and the women I used to go with not because they are any worse but
because they remind me of what I have lost I have reached the point now
where I have got to have news of Susanna or go and shoot myself

That would be about the only piece of foolishness you have nt
committed already replied Louisa with a biting satire that would
have made any man let go of the trigger in case he had gone so far as to
begin pulling it

Where is she John went on without anger at her sarcasm Where is
she how is she what is she living on is she well is she just as
bitter as she was at first does she ever speak of coming back Tell me
something tell me anything I will know something I say I _will_

Louisas calm demeanor began to show a little agitation for she was not
used to the sight of emotion I cant tell you where Susanna is for I
made her a solemn promise I would nt unless you or Jack were in danger
of some kind but I dont mind telling you this much that shes well
and in the safest kind of a shelter for shes been living from the
first in a Shaker Settlement

Shaker Settlement cried John starting up from his seat on the
steps Whats that I know Shaker eggbeaters and gardenseeds
and rockingchairs and oh yes I remember their religions against
marriage Thats the worst thing you could have told me that ends all
hope if they once get hold of a woman like Susanna theyll never
let go of her if they dont believe in a womans marrying a good man
theyd never let her go back to a bad one Oh if I had only known
this before if only youd told me Louisa perhaps I could have done
something Maybe they take vows or sign contracts and so I have lost
her altogether

I dont know much about their beliefs and Susanna never explained
them returned Louisa nervously but now that youve got something
to offer her why dont you write and ask her to come back to you Ill
send your letter to her

I dont dare Louisa I dont dare groaned John leaning his head
against one of the pillars of the porch I cant tell you the fear I
have of Susanna after the way Ive neglected her this last year If she
should come in at the gate this minute I could nt meet her eyes if
youd read the letter she left me youd feel the same way I deserved
it to the last word but oh it was like so many separate strokes of
lightning and every one of them burned It was nothing but the truth
but it was cut in with a sharp sword Unless she should come back to me
of her own accord and she never will I have nt got the courage to
ask her just have nt got the courage thats all there is to say about
it And here John buried his head in his hands

A very queer thing happened to Louisa Banks at this moment A
halfsecond before she would have murmured

 This rock shall fly From its firm base as soon as I

when all at once and without warning a strange something occurred in
the organ which she had always regarded and her opinion had never yet
been questioned as a good tough lovetight heart First there was a
flutter and a tremor running all along her spine then her eyes filled
then a lump rose in her throat and choked her then words trembled on
her tongue and refused to be uttered then something like a birdcould
it have been the highly respectable goodasnew heartthrobbed under
her black silk Sunday waist then she grew like wax from the crown
of her head to the soles of her feet then in a twinkling and so
unconsciously as to be unashamed of it she became a sister

You have seen a gray November morning melt into an Indian summer noon
Louisa Banks was like that when at the sight of a man in sore trouble
sympathy was born in her to soften the rockiness of her original makeup

There there John dont be so downhearted she stammered drawing
her chair closer and putting her hand on his shoulder Well bring it
round right you see if we dont Youve done the most yourself already
for Im proud of the way youve acted stiffening right up like an
honest man and showing youve got some good sensible Hathaway stuff in
you after all and aint ashamed to turn your back on your evil ways
Susanna aint one to refuse forgiveness

She forgave for a long time but she refused at last Why should she
change now John asked

You remember she has nt heard a single word from you nor about you
in that outoftheway place where shes been living said Louisa
consolingly She thinks youre the same as you were or worse maybe
Perhaps shes waiting for you to make some sign through me for she
dont know that you care anything about her or are pining to have her
back

Such a woman as Susanna must know better than that cried John She
ought to know that when a man got used to living with anybody like her
he could never endure any other kind

How should she know all that Jacks been writing to her and telling
her the news for the last few weeks though I have nt said a word about
you because I did nt know how long your reformation was going to hold
out but I wont let the grass grow under my feet now till I tell her
just how things stand

Youre a good woman Louisa I dont see why I never noticed it
before

Its because Ive been concealing my goodness too much Stay here with
me tonight and dont go back to brood in that dismal forsaken house
Well see how Jack is in the morning and if hes all right take him
along with you sos to be all there together if Susanna comes back this
week as I kind of hope she will Make Ellen have the house all nice
and cheerful from top to bottom with a good supper ready to put on the
table the night she comes Youd better pick your asters and take em in
for the parlor then Ill cut the chrysanthemums for you in the middle
of the week The day she comes Ill happen in and stay to dinner if
you find its going to be mortifying for you but if everything is as I
expect it will be and the way Susanna always did have things Ill
make for home and leave you to yourselves Susanna aint one to nag and
hector and triumph over a man when hes repented

John hugged Louisa pepperandsalt shawl black rigolette and all
when she finished this unprecedented speech and when he went to sleep
that night in the old north chamber the one he and Louisa had been
born in the one his father and mother had died in it was with a little
smile of hope on his lips

 Set her place at hearth and board
 As it used to be

These were the last words that crossed his waking thoughts
Before Louisa went to her own bed she wrote one of her brief and
characteristic epistles to Susanna but it did not reach her for the
hills of home had called Johns wife so insistently on that Sunday
that the next day found her on her way back to Farnham


Dear Susanna so the letter read Theres a new man in your house at
Farnham His name is John Hathaway but hes made all over and it was
high time I say its the hand of God He wont own up that it is but
Im letting him alone for Ive done quarreling though I dont like to
see a man get religion and deny it for all the world like Peter in
the New Testament If you have nt used up the last one of your
seventytimessevens I think youd better come back and forgive your
husband If you dont youd better send for your son Im willing to
bear the burdens the Lord intends specially for me but Jack belongs to
you and a goodsized heavy burden he is too for his age I cant deny
that if he is a Hathaway I think hes the kind of a boy that ought to
be put in a barrel and fed through the bunghole till he grows up but of
course Im not used to childrens ways

Be as easy with John at first as you can I know you ll say _I_ never
was with my husband but he was different he got to like a bracing
treatment Adlai did Manys the time he said to me Louisa when you
make up our minds Im always contented But John is nt made that way
Hes a changed man now what weve got to do is to _keep_ him changed
He does nt bear you any grudge for leaving him so he wont reproach
you

Hoping to see you before long I am

Yours as usual

Louisa Banks




XI The Open Door


On the Saturday evening before the yearly Day of Sacrifice the spiritual
heads of each Shaker family called upon all the Believers to enter
heartily next day into the humiliations and blessings of open
confession

The Sabbath dawns upon an awed and solemn household Footfalls are
hushed the childrens chatter is stilled and all go to the morning
meal in silence There is a strange quiet but it is not sadness it
is a hush as when in Israels camp the silver trumpets sounded and the
people stayed in their tents Then Elder Gray explained to Susanna
a summons comes to each Believer for all have been searching the heart
and scanning the life of the months past Softly the one called goes
to the door of the one appointed by the Divine Spirit the human
representative who is to receive the gift of the burdened soul Woman
confesses to woman man to man it is the open door that leads to God

Susanna lifted Eldress Abbys latch and stood in her strong patient
presence then all at once she knelt impulsively and looked up into her
serene eyes

Do you come as a Believer Susanna tremblingly asked the Eldress

No Eldress Abby I come as a child of the world who wants to go back
to her duty and hopes to do it better than she ever did before She
ought to be able to because you have chastened her pride taught her
the lesson of patience strengthened her will purified her spirit and
cleansed her soul from bitterness and wrath I waited till afternoon
when all the confessions were over May I speak now

Eldress Abby bowed but she looked weak and stricken and old

I had something you would have called a vision last night but I think
of it as a dream and I know just what led to it You told me Polly
Reeds story and the little quail bird had such a charm for Sue that
Ive repeated it to her more than once In my sleep I seemed to see a
mother quail with a little one beside her The two were always together
happily flying or hopping about under the trees but every now and then
I heard a sad little note as of a deserted bird somewhere in the wood
I walked a short distance and parting the branches saw on the open
ground another parent bird and a young one by its side darting hither
and thither as if lost they seemed to be restlessly searching for
something and always they uttered the soft sad note as if the nest
had disappeared and they had been parted from the little flock Of
course my brain had changed the very meaning of the Shaker story and
translated it into different terms but when I woke this morning I
could think of nothing but my husband and my boy The two of them seemed
to me to be needing me searching for me in the dangerous open country
while I was hidden away in the safe shelter of the woodI and the other
little quail bird I had taken out of the nest

Do you think you could persuade your husband to unite with us asked
Abby wiping her eyes

The tension of the situation was too tightly drawn for mirth or Susanna
could have smiled but she answered soberly No if John could develop
the best in himself he could be a good husband and father a good
neighbor and citizen and an upright business man but never a Shaker

Did nt he insult your wifely honor and disgrace your home Yes in
the last few weeks before I left him All his earlier offenses were more
against himself than me in a sense I forgave him many a time but I am
not certain it was the seventy times seven that the Bible bids us I
am not free from blame myself I was hard the last year for I had lost
hope and my pride was trailing in the dust I left him a bitter letter
one without any love or hope or faith in it just because at the moment
I believed I ought once in my life to let him know how I felt toward
him

How can you go back and live under his roof with that feeling Its
degradation

It has changed I was morbid then and so wounded and weak that I could
not fight any longer I am rested now and calm My pluck has come back
and my strength Ive learned a good deal here about casting out my own
devils now I am going home and help him to cast out his Perhaps he
wont be there perhaps he does nt want me though when he was his
very best self he loved me dearly but that was long long ago sighed
Susanna drearily

Oh this thing the worlds people call love groaned Abby

There is love and love even in the world outside for if it is Adams
world it is Gods too Abby The love I gave my husband was good I
think but it failed somewhere and I am going back to try again I am
not any too happy in leaving you and taking up perhaps heavier burdens
than those from which I escaped

Night after night Ive prayed to be the means of leading you to the
celestial life said the Eldress but my plaint was not worthy to
be heard Oh that God would increase our numbers and so revive our
drooping faith We work we struggle we sacrifice we pray we defy the
world and deny the flesh yet we fail to gather in Believers

Dont say you ve failed dear dear Abby cried Susanna pressing
the Eldresss workstained hands to her lips God speaks to you in one
voice to me in another Does it matter so much as long as we both hear
Him Surely its the hearing and the obeying that counts most Wish me
well dear friend and help me to say goodbye to the Elder

The two women found Elder Gray in the office and Abby still
unresigned laid Susannas case before him

The Great Architect has need of many kinds of workmen in His building
said the Elder There are those who are willing to put aside the ties
of flesh for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive
it let him receive it

There may also he those who are willing to take up the ties of the
flesh for the kingdom of heavens sake answered Susanna gently but
with a certain courage

Her face glowed with emotion her eyes shone her lips were parted It
was a new thought Abby and Daniel gazed at her for a moment without
speaking then Daniel said Its a terrible cross to some of the
Brethren and Sisters to live here outside of the world but maybe its
more of a cross for such as you to live in it under such conditions as
have surrounded you of late years To pursue good and resist evil to
bear your cross cheerfully and to grow in grace and knowledge of truth
while youre bearing it thats the lesson of life I suppose If you
find you cant learn it outside come back to us Susanna

I will she promised and no words can speak my gratitude for what
you have all done for me Many a time it will come back to me and keep
me from faltering

She looked back at him from the open doorway timidly

Dont forget us Sue and me altogether she said her eyes filling
with tears Come to Farnham if you will and see if I am a credit to
Shaker teaching I shall never be here again perhaps and somehow it
seems to me as if you Elder Gray with your education and your gifts
ought to be leading a larger life than this

Ive hunted in the wild Maine forests in my young days Ive speared
salmon in her rivers and shot rapids ill a birchbark canoe said the
Elder looking up from the pine table that served as a desk Ive been
before the mast and seen strange countries Ive fought Indians Ive
faced perils on land and sea but this Shaker life is the greatest
adventure of all

Adventure echoed Susanna uncomprehendingly

Adventure repeated the Elder smiling at his own thoughts Whether I
fail or whether I succeed its a splendid adventure in ethics

Abby and Daniel looked at each other when Susanna passed out of the
office door

They went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been
of us they would have continued with us he quoted quietly

Abby wiped her eyes with her apron Its a hard road to travel
sometimes Daniel she said

Yee but think where it leads Abby think where it leads Youre not
going to complain of dust when youre treading the Kings Highway


Susanna left the office with a drooping head knowing the sadness that
she had left behind Brother Ansel sat under the trees near by and his
shrewd eye perceived the drift of coming events

Well Susanna he drawled youre goin to leave us like most o the
other jiners I can see that with one eye shut

Yes she replied with a half smile but you see Ansel I jined
John Hathaway before I knew anything about Shaker doctrines

Yee but whats to prevent your onjinin him They used to tie up
married folks in the old times sot they could nt move an inch When
they read the constitution and bylaws over em they used to put in till
death do us part Thats the way my father was hitched to his three
wives but death _did_ em partfortunately for him

Till death us do part is still in the marriage service Susanna
said and I think of it very often

I want to know if thats there yit exclaimed Ansel with apparent
surprise I thought they must be leavin it out theres so much
onjinin nowadays Well accordin to my notions if there is anything
wuss n marriage its hevin it hold till death for then menfolks
dont git any chance of a speritual life till afterwards They certainly
dont when theyre being dragged down by womenfolks an young ones

I think the lasting part of the bargain makes it all the more solemn
Susanna argued

Oh yes its solemn enough but sos a prayer meetin an considable
more elevatin  and here Ansel regarded the surrounding scenery with
frowning disapproval as if it left much to be desired

Dont you think that there are any agreeable and pleasant women
Ansel ventured Susanna

Land yes heaps of em but they all wear Shaker bunnits

I suppose you know more about the women in the outside world than most
of the Brothers on account of traveling so much

I guess anybody t drives a seedcart or peddles stuff along the
road knows enough o women to keep clear of em They ll come out the
kitchen door choose their papers o seasonin an bottles o flavorin
worry you bout the price an take the aidge off every dime make up an
then onmake their minds bout what they want ask if its pure an when
by good luck you git your cart out o the yard they come runnin along
the road after ye to git ye to swap a bottle o vanilla for some spruce
gum an give em back the change

Susanna could not help smiling at Ansels arraignment of her sex Do
you think they follow you for the pleasure of shopping or the pleasure
of your conversation Ansel she asked slyly

A little o both mebbe though the pleasures all on their side
returned the unchivalrous Ansel But take them same women cut their
hair close to their heads theres a heap o foolishness in hair
somehow purge em o their vanity so they wont be lookin in the
glass all the time make em depend on one another for sassiety so they
wont crave no conversation with menfolks an you git an article thats
bout as good and bout as stiddy as a man

You never seem to remember that men are just as dangerous to
womens happiness and goodness as women are to mens said Susanna
courageously

It dont seem so to me Never see a man hardly that could stick to
the straight an narrer if a woman wanted him to go the other way Weak
an unstable as water menfolks are an women are powful strong

Have your own way Ansel Im going back to the world but no man shall
ever say I hindered him from being good Youll see women clearer in
another world

Therell be precious few of em to see retorted Ansel Youre about
the best o the lot but even you have a kind of a managin way with
ye besides fillin us all full o false hopes that wed gathered in a
useful Believer one callated to spread the doctrines o Mother Ann

I know I know Ansel and oh how sorry I am You would never believe
how I long to stay and help you never believe how much you have helped
me Goodbye Ansel youve made me smile when my heart was breaking I
shant forget you




XII The Hills of Home


Susanna had found Sue in the upper chamber at the Office Building and
began to make the simple preparations for her homeward journey It was
the very hour when John Hathaway was saying

 Set her place at hearth and board
 As it used to be

Sue interfered with the packing somewhat by darting to and fro bringing
her mother sacred souvenirs given her by the Shaker sisters and
the childrenneedlebooks pinballs thimblecases packets of
flowerseeds polished pebbles bottles of flavoring extract

This is for Fardie she would say and this for Jack and this for
Ellen and this for Aunt Louisathe needlebook cause shes so useful
Oh Im glad were going home Mardie though I do love it here and I
was most ready to be a truly Shaker Its kind of pityish to have your
hair shingled and your stocking halfknitted and know how to say yee
and then have it all wasted

Susanna dropped a tear on the dress she was folding The child was going
home as she had come away from it gay irresponsible and merry it
was only the mothers who hoped and feared and dreaded The very universe
was working toward Susannas desire at that moment but she was all
unaware of the happiness that lay so near She could not see the
freshness of the house in Farnham the new bits of furniture here and
there the autumn leaves in her own bedroom her worktable full of
the records of Johns sorrowful summer Jack handsomer and taller and
softer also in his welcoming mood Ellen rosy and excited She did not
know that Joel Atterbury had said to John that day I take it all back
old man and I hope youll stay on in the firm nor that Aunt Louisa
who was putting stiff shortstemmed chrysanthemums in cups and tumblers
here and there through the house was much more flexible and human than
was natural to her nor that John alternating between hope and despair
was forever humming

 Set her place at hearth and board
 As it used to be
 Higher are the hills of home
 Bluer is the sea

It is often so They who go weeping to look for the dead body of a
sorrow find a vision of angels where the body has lain

I hope Fardie ll be glad to see us and Ellen will have gingerbread
Sue chattered then pausing at the window she added Im sorry to
leave the hills cause I specially like them dont you Mardie

We are leaving the Shaker hills but we are going to the hills of
home her mother answered cheerily Dont you remember the Farnham
hills dear

Yes I remember and Sue looked thoughtful they were farther off and
covered with woods these are smooth and gentle And we shall miss the
lake Mardie

Yes but we can look at the blue sea from your bedroom window Sue

And well tell Fardie about Polly Reed and the little quail bird wont
we

Yes but he and Jack will have a great deal to say to us and we must
nt talk all the time about the dear kind Shakers you know

Youre all _buts_ Mardie at which Susanna smiled through her
tears

Twilight deepened into dusk and dusk into dark and then the moon rose
over the poplar trees outside the window where Susanna and Sue were
sleeping The Shaker Brethren and Sisters were resting serenely after
their day of confession It was the aged Tabithas last Sabbath on
earth but had she known it would have made no difference if ever a
soul was ready for heaven it was Tabithas

There was an Irish family at the foot of the long hill that lay between
the Settlement and the village of Albion father mother and children
had prayed to the Virgin before they went to bed and the grayhaired
minister in the lowroofed parsonage was writing his communion sermon on
a text sacred to the orthodox Christian world The same moon shone over
all and over millions of others worshiping strange idols and holding
strange beliefs in strange far lands yet none of them owned the whole
of heaven for as Elder Gray said It is a big place and belongs to
God

Susanna Hathaway went back to John thinking it her plain duty and to me
it seems beautiful that she found waiting for her at the journeys end a
new love that was better than the old found a husband to whom she could
say in that first sacred hour when they were alone together Never
mind John Lets forget and begin all over again


When Susanna and Sue alighted at the little railway station at Farnham
and started to walk through the narrow streets that led to the suburbs
the mothers heart beat more and more tumultuously as she realized that
the issues of four lives would be settled before nightfall

Little did Sue reck of life issues skipping like a young roe from one
side of the road to the other There are the hills not a bit changed
Mardie she cried and the sea is just where it was Heres the
house with the parrot do you remember Now the place where the dog
barks and snarls is coming next Praps hell be dead or praps
hell be nicer Keep close to me till we get past the gate He did
nt come out so praps he is dead or gone avisiting Theres that
specially lazy cow thats always lying down in the Buxtons field
I dont blieve shes moved since we came away Do you spose she
stands up to be milked Mardie Theres the old bridge over the brook
just the same only the woodbines red Theres Theres Oh
Mardie look look I do blieve its our Jacky

Sue flew over the ground like a swallow calling Jacky Jacky Its
me and Mardie come home

Jack extricated himself from his sisters strangling hug and settled his
collar Im awful glad to see you Sukey he said but Im getting
too big to be kissed Besides my pockets are full of angleworms and
fishhooks

Are you too big to be kissed even by mother called Susanna hurrying
to her boy who submitted to her embrace with better grace O Jack
Jack say youre glad to see mother Say it say it I cant wait
Jack

Course Im glad Why would nt I be I tell you Im tired of Aunt
Louisa though shes easier than she was Time and again Ive packed my
lunch basket and started to run away but I always made it a picnic and
went back again thinking theyd make such a row over me

Aunt Louisa is always kind when youre obedient Susanna urged She
aint so stiff as she was Ellen is real worried about her and thinks
shes losing her strength shes so easy to get along with

Hows father

Bettern he was

Has nt he been well

Not so very always quiet and wont eat nor play nor anything Im
home with him since Sunday

What is the matter with your clothes asked Susanna casting a
maternal eye over him while she pulled him down here and up there with
anxious disapproving glances You look so patched and wrinkled and
grubby

Aunt Louisa and father make me keep my best to put on for you if you
should come I clean up and dress every afternoon at train time only I
forgot today and came fishing

Its too cold to fish sonny

It aint too cold to fish but its too cold for em to bite
corrected Jack

Why were you expecting us just now asked Susanna I did nt write
because because I thought perhaps it would be better to
surprise you

Fathers expecting you every day not just this one said Jack

Susanna sank down on a stone at the end of the bridge and leaning her
head against the railing burst into tears In that moment the worst of
her fears rolled away from her heart like the stone from the mouth of a
sepulcher If her husband had looked for her return he must have missed
her regretted her needed her just a little His disposition was
sweet even if it were thoughtless and he might not meet her with
reproaches after all There might not be the cold greeting she had often
feared_Well youve concluded to come back have you_ _It was about
time_ If only John were a little penitent a little anxious to meet
her on some common ground she felt her task would be an easier one

Have you got a pain Mardie cried Sue anxiously bending over her
mother

No dear she answered smiling through her tears and stretching a
hand to both children to help her to her feet No dear Ive lost
one

I cry when anything aches not when it stops remarked Jack as the
three started again on their walk Say Sukey you look bigger and
fatter than you did when you went away and youve got short curls
stead of long ones Do you see how Ive grown Two inches

Im inches and inches bigger and taller Sue boasted standing on
tiptoe and stretching herself proudly And I can knit and pull maple
candy and say Yee and sing O Virgin Church how great thy light

Pooh said Jack I can sing A sailors lifes the life for me Yo
ho yo ho Step along faster mummy dear its most supper time Aunt
Louisa wont scold if youre with me Theres the house see Father ll
be working in the garden covering up the asters so they wont freeze
before you come

There is no garden Jack What do you mean Wait till you see if
theres no garden Hurrah theres father at the window side of Aunt
Louisa Wont he be pleased I met you halfway and brought you home


Oh it was beautiful the autumn twilight the smoke of her own
hearthside rising through the brick chimneys She thought she had left
the way of peace behind her but no the way of peace was here where
her duty was and her husband and children

The sea was deep blue the home hills rolled softly along the horizon
the little gate that Susanna had closed behind her in anger and misery
stood wide open shrubs borders young hedgerows beds of late autumn
flowers greeted her eyes and touched her heart A foot sounded on the
threshold the home door opened and smiled a greeting and then a voice
choked with feeling glad with welcome called her name

Lightfooted Sue ran with a cry of joy into her fathers outstretched
arms and then leaping down darted to Ellen chattering like a magpie
Husband and wife looked at each other for one quivering moment and then
clasped each other close

Forgive O Susanna forgive

Johns eyes and lips and arms made mute appeals and it was then Susanna
said Never mind John Lets forget and begin all over again
