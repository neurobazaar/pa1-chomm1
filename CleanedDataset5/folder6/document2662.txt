UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE
or
THE MELLSTOCK QUIRE
A RURAL PAINTING OF THE DUTCH SCHOOL
by Thomas Hardy


PREFACE


This story of the Mellstock Quire and its old established westgallery
musicians with some supplementary descriptions of similar officials in
Two on a Tower A Few Crusted Characters and other places is intended
to be a fairly true picture at first hand of the personages ways and
customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of
fifty or sixty years ago

One is inclined to regret the displacement of these ecclesiastical
bandsmen by an isolated organist often at first a barrelorganist or
harmonium player and despite certain advantages in point of control and
accomplishment which were no doubt secured by installing the single
artist the change has tended to stultify the professed aims of the
clergy its direct result being to curtail and extinguish the interest of
parishioners in church doings Under the old plan from half a dozen to
ten fullgrown players in addition to the numerous more or less grownup
singers were officially occupied with the Sunday routine and concerned
in trying their best to make it an artistic outcome of the combined
musical taste of the congregation With a musical executive limited as
it mostly is limited now to the parsons wife or daughter and the school
children or to the schoolteacher and the children an important union
of interests has disappeared

The zest of these bygone instrumentalists must have been keen and staying
to take them as it did on foot every Sunday after a toilsome week
through all weathers to the church which often lay at a distance from
their homes They usually received so little in payment for their
performances that their efforts were really a labour of love In the
parish I had in my mind when writing the present tale the gratuities
received yearly by the musicians at Christmas were somewhat as follows
From the manorhouse ten shillings and a supper from the vicar ten
shillings from the farmers five shillings each from each
cottagehousehold one shilling amounting altogether to not more than ten
shillings a head annuallyjust enough as an old executant told me to
pay for their fiddlestrings repairs rosin and musicpaper which they
mostly ruled themselves Their music in those days was all in their own
manuscript copied in the evenings after work and their musicbooks were
homebound

It was customary to inscribe a few jigs reels hornpipes and ballads
in the same book by beginning it at the other end the insertions being
continued from front and back till sacred and secular met together in the
middle often with bizarre effect the words of some of the songs
exhibiting that ancient and broad humour which our grandfathers and
possibly grandmothers took delight in and is in these days unquotable

The aforesaid fiddlestrings rosin and musicpaper were supplied by a
pedlar who travelled exclusively in such wares from parish to parish
coming to each village about every six months Tales are told of the
consternation once caused among the church fiddlers when on the occasion
of their producing a new Christmas anthem he did not come to time owing
to being snowed up on the downs and the straits they were in through
having to make shift with whipcord and twine for strings He was
generally a musician himself and sometimes a composer in a small way
bringing his own new tunes and tempting each choir to adopt them for a
consideration Some of these compositions which now lie before me with
their repetitions of lines halflines and halfwords their fugues and
their intermediate symphonies are good singing still though they would
hardly be admitted into such hymnbooks as are popular in the churches of
fashionable society at the present time

August 1896

Under the Greenwood Tree was first brought out in the summer of 1872 in
two volumes The name of the story was originally intended to be more
appropriately The Mellstock Quire and this has been appended as a sub
title since the early editions it having been thought unadvisable to
displace for it the title by which the book first became known

In rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the
inevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were
material for another kind of study of this little group of church
musicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly even so
farcically and flippantly at times But circumstances would have
rendered any aim at a deeper more essential more transcendent handling
unadvisable at the date of writing and the exhibition of the Mellstock
Quire in the following pages must remain the only extant one except for
the few glimpses of that perished band which I have given in verse
elsewhere

PART THE FIRSTWINTER


CHAPTER I MELLSTOCKLANE


To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well
as its feature At the passing of the breeze the firtrees sob and moan
no less distinctly than they rock the holly whistles as it battles with
itself the ash hisses amid its quiverings the beech rustles while its
flat boughs rise and fall And winter which modifies the note of such
trees as shed their leaves does not destroy its individuality

On a cold and starry Christmaseve within living memory a man was passing
up a lane towards Mellstock Cross in the darkness of a plantation that
whispered thus distinctively to his intelligence All the evidences of
his nature were those afforded by the spirit of his footsteps which
succeeded each other lightly and quickly and by the liveliness of his
voice as he sang in a rural cadence

 With the rose and the lily
 And the daffodowndilly
 The lads and the lasses asheepshearing go

The lonely lane he was following connected one of the hamlets of
Mellstock parish with Upper Mellstock and Lewgate and to his eyes
casually glancing upward the silver and blackstemmed birches with their
characteristic tufts the pale grey boughs of beech the darkcreviced
elm all appeared now as black and flat outlines upon the sky wherein
the white stars twinkled so vehemently that their flickering seemed like
the flapping of wings Within the woody pass at a level anything lower
than the horizon all was dark as the grave The copsewood forming the
sides of the bower interlaced its branches so densely even at this
season of the year that the draught from the northeast flew along the
channel with scarcely an interruption from lateral breezes

After passing the plantation and reaching Mellstock Cross the white
surface of the lane revealed itself between the dark hedgerows like a
ribbon jagged at the edges the irregularity being caused by temporary
accumulations of leaves extending from the ditch on either side

The song many times interrupted by flitting thoughts which took the
place of several bars and resumed at a point it would have reached had
its continuity been unbroken now received a more palpable check in the
shape of Hoiiiii from the crossing lane to Lower Mellstock on
the right of the singer who had just emerged from the trees

Hoiiiii he answered stopping and looking round though with no
idea of seeing anything more than imagination pictured

Is that thee young Dick Dewy came from the darkness

Ay sure Michael Mail

Then why not stop for fellowcratersgoing to thy own fathers house
too as we be and knowen us so well

Dick Dewy faced about and continued his tune in an underwhistle
implying that the business of his mouth could not be checked at a
moments notice by the placid emotion of friendship

Having come more into the open he could now be seen rising against the
sky his profile appearing on the light background like the portrait of a
gentleman in black cardboard It assumed the form of a lowcrowned hat
an ordinaryshaped nose an ordinary chin an ordinary neck and ordinary
shoulders What he consisted of further down was invisible from lack of
sky low enough to picture him on

Shuffling halting irregular footsteps of various kinds were now heard
coming up the hill and presently there emerged from the shade severally
five men of different ages and gaits all of them working villagers of
the parish of Mellstock They too had lost their rotundity with the
daylight and advanced against the sky in flat outlines which suggested
some processional design on Greek or Etruscan pottery They represented
the chief portion of Mellstock parish choir

The first was a bowed and bent man who carried a fiddle under his arm
and walked as if engaged in studying some subject connected with the
surface of the road He was Michael Mail the man who had hallooed to
Dick

The next was Mr Robert Penny boot and shoemaker a little man who
though rather roundshouldered walked as if that fact had not come to
his own knowledge moving on with his back very hollow and his face fixed
on the northeast quarter of the heavens before him so that his lower
waistcoatbuttons came first and then the remainder of his figure His
features were invisible yet when he occasionally looked round two faint
moons of light gleamed for an instant from the precincts of his eyes
denoting that he wore spectacles of a circular form

The third was Elias Spinks who walked perpendicularly and dramatically
The fourth outline was Joseph Bowmans who had now no distinctive
appearance beyond that of a human being Finally came a weak lathlike
form trotting and stumbling along with one shoulder forward and his head
inclined to the left his arms dangling nervelessly in the wind as if
they were empty sleeves This was Thomas Leaf

Where be the boys said Dick to this somewhat indifferentlymatched
assembly

The eldest of the group Michael Mail cleared his throat from a great
depth

We told them to keep back at home for a time thinken they wouldnt be
wanted yet awhile and we could choose the tuens and so on

Father and grandfather William have expected ye a little sooner I have
just been for a run round by Ewelease Stile and Hollow Hill to warm my
feet

To be sure father did To be sure a did expect usto taste the little
barrel beyond compare that hes going to tap

Od rabbit it all Never heard a word of it said Mr Penny gleams of
delight appearing upon his spectacleglasses Dick meanwhile singing
parenthetically

 The lads and the lasses asheepshearing go

Neighbours theres time enough to drink a sight of drink now afore
bedtime said Mail

True truetime enough to get as drunk as lords replied Bowman
cheerfully

This opinion being taken as convincing they all advanced between the
varying hedges and the trees dotting them here and there kicking their
toes occasionally among the crumpled leaves Soon appeared glimmering
indications of the few cottages forming the small hamlet of Upper
Mellstock for which they were bound whilst the faint sound of church
bells ringing a Christmas peal could be heard floating over upon the
breeze from the direction of Longpuddle and Weatherbury parishes on the
other side of the hills A little wicket admitted them to the garden
and they proceeded up the path to Dicks house



CHAPTER II THE TRANTERS


It was a long low cottage with a hipped roof of thatch having dormer
windows breaking up into the eaves a chimney standing in the middle of
the ridge and another at each end The windowshutters were not yet
closed and the fire and candlelight within radiated forth upon the
thick bushes of box and laurestinus growing in clumps outside and upon
the bare boughs of several codlintrees hanging about in various
distorted shapes the result of early training as espaliers combined with
careless climbing into their boughs in later years The walls of the
dwelling were for the most part covered with creepers though these were
rather beaten back from the doorwaya feature which was worn and
scratched by much passing in and out giving it by day the appearance of
an old keyhole Light streamed through the cracks and joints of
outbuildings a little way from the cottage a sight which nourished a
fancy that the purpose of the erection must be rather to veil bright
attractions than to shelter unsightly necessaries The noise of a beetle
and wedges and the splintering of wood was periodically heard from this
direction and at some little distance further a steady regular munching
and the occasional scurr of a rope betokened a stable and horses feeding
within it

The choir stamped severally on the doorstone to shake from their boots
any fragment of earth or leaf adhering thereto then entered the house
and looked around to survey the condition of things Through the open
doorway of a small inner room on the right hand of a character between
pantry and cellar was Dick Dewys father Reuben by vocation a
tranter or irregular carrier He was a stout florid man about forty
years of age who surveyed people up and down when first making their
acquaintance and generally smiled at the horizon or other distant object
during conversations with friends walking about with a steady sway and
turning out his toes very considerably Being now occupied in bending
over a hogshead that stood in the pantry ready horsed for the process of
broaching he did not take the trouble to turn or raise his eyes at the
entry of his visitors well knowing by their footsteps that they were the
expected old comrades

The main room on the left was decked with bunches of holly and other
evergreens and from the middle of the beam bisecting the ceiling hung
the mistletoe of a size out of all proportion to the room and extending
so low that it became necessary for a fullgrown person to walk round it
in passing or run the risk of entangling his hair This apartment
contained Mrs Dewy the tranters wife and the four remaining children
Susan Jim Bessy and Charley graduating uniformly though at wide
stages from the age of sixteen to that of four yearsthe eldest of the
series being separated from Dick the firstborn by a nearly equal
interval

Some circumstance had apparently caused much grief to Charley just
previous to the entry of the choir and he had absently taken down a
small lookingglass holding it before his face to learn how the human
countenance appeared when engaged in crying which survey led him to
pause at the various points in each wail that were more than ordinarily
striking for a thorough appreciation of the general effect Bessy was
leaning against a chair and glancing under the plaits about the waist of
the plaid frock she wore to notice the original unfaded pattern of the
material as there preserved her face bearing an expression of regret
that the brightness had passed away from the visible portions Mrs Dewy
sat in a brown settle by the side of the glowing wood fireso glowing
that with a heedful compression of the lips she would now and then rise
and put her hand upon the hams and flitches of bacon lining the chimney
to reassure herself that they were not being broiled instead of smokeda
misfortune that had been known to happen now and then at Christmastime

Hullo my sonnies here you be then said Reuben Dewy at length
standing up and blowing forth a vehement gust of breath How the blood
do puff up in anybodys head to be sure astooping like that I was
just going out to gate to hark for ye He then carefully began to wind
a strip of brown paper round a brass tap he held in his hand This in
the cask here is a drop o the right sort tapping the cask tis a
real drop o cordial from the best picked applesSansoms Stubbards
Fivecorners and suchlikeyou dmind the sort Michael Michael
nodded And theres a sprinkling of they that grow down by the orchard
railsstreaked onesrail apples we dcall em as tis by the rails
they grow and not knowing the right name The watercider from em is
as good as most peoples best cider is

Ay and of the same make too said Bowman It rained when we wrung
it out and the water got into it folk will say But tis ony an
excuse Watered cider is too common among us

Yes yes too common it is said Spinks with an inward sigh whilst his
eyes seemed to be looking at the case in an abstract form rather than at
the scene before him Such poor liquor do make a mans throat feel very
melancholyand is a disgrace to the name of stimmilent

Come in come in and draw up to the fire never mind your shoes said
Mrs Dewy seeing that all except Dick had paused to wipe them upon the
doormat I am glad that youve stepped upalong at last and Susan
you run down to Grammer Kaytess and see if you can borrow some larger
candles than these fourteens Tommy Leaf dont ye be afeard Come and
sit here in the settle

This was addressed to the young man before mentioned consisting chiefly
of a human skeleton and a smockfrock who was very awkward in his
movements apparently on account of having grown so very fast that before
he had had time to get used to his height he was higher

Heeheeay replied Leaf letting his mouth continue to smile for
some time after his mind had done smiling so that his teeth remained in
view as the most conspicuous members of his body

Here Mr Penny resumed Mrs Dewy you sit in this chair And hows
your daughter Mrs Brownjohn

Well I suppose I must say pretty fair He adjusted his spectacles a
quarter of an inch to the right But shell be worse before shes
better a blieve

Indeedpoor soul And how many will that make in all four or five

Five theyve buried three Yes five and she not much more than a
maid yet She do know the multiplication table onmistakable well
However twas to be and none can gainsay it

Mrs Dewy resigned Mr Penny Wonder where your grandfather James is
she inquired of one of the children He said hed drop in tonight

Out in fuelhouse with grandfather William said Jimmy

Now lets see what we can do was heard spoken about this time by the
tranter in a private voice to the barrel beside which he had again
established himself and was stooping to cut away the cork

Reuben dont make such a mess o tapping that barrel as is mostly made
in this house Mrs Dewy cried from the fireplace Id tap a hundred
without wasting more than you do in one Such a squizzling and squirting
job as tis in your hands There he always was such a clumsy man
indoors

Ay ay I know youd tap a hundred beautiful AnnI know you would two
hundred perhaps But I cant promise This is a old cask and the
woods rotted away about the taphole The husbird of a feller Sam
Lawsonthat ever I should calln such now hes dead and gone poor
hearttook me in completely upon the feat of buying this cask Reub
says hea always used to call me plain Reub poor old heartReub
he said says he that there cask Reub is as good as new yes good as
new Tis a winehogshead the best portwine in the commonwealth have
been in that there cask and you shall have en for ten shillens
Reuba said says hehes worth twenty ay fiveandtwenty if
hes worth one and an iron hoop or two put round en among the wood ones
will make en worth thirty shillens of any mans money if

I think I should have used the eyes that Providence gave me to use afore
I paid any ten shillens for a jimcrack winebarrel a saint is sinner
enough not to be cheated But tis like all your family was so easy to
be deceived

Thats as true as gospel of this member said Reuben

Mrs Dewy began a smile at the answer then altering her lips and
refolding them so that it was not a smile commenced smoothing little
Bessys hair the tranter having meanwhile suddenly become oblivious to
conversation occupying himself in a deliberate cutting and arrangement
of some more brown paper for the broaching operation

Ah who can believe sellers said old Michael Mail in a
carefullycautious voice by way of tidingover this critical point of
affairs

No one at all said Joseph Bowman in the tone of a man fully agreeing
with everybody

Ay said Mail in the tone of a man who did not agree with everybody as
a rule though he did now I knowed a auctioneering feller oncea very
friendly feller a was too And so one hot day as I was walking down the
front street o Casterbridge jist below the Kings Arms I passed a
open winder and see him inside stuck upon his perch aselling off I
jist nodded to en in a friendly way as I passed and went my way and
thought no more about it Well next day as I was oilen my boots by
fuelhouse door if a letter didnt come wi a bill charging me with a
featherbed bolster and pillers that I had bid for at Mr Taylors
sale The slimfaced martel had knocked em down to me because I nodded
to en in my friendly way and I had to pay for em too Now I hold that
that was coming it very close Reuben

Twas close theres no denying said the general voice

Too close twas said Reuben in the rear of the rest And as to Sam
Lawsonpoor heart now hes dead and gone tooIll warrant that if so
be Ive spent one hour in making hoops for that barrel Ive spent fifty
first and last Thats one of my hoopstouching it with his
elbowthats one of mine and that and that and all these

Ah Sam was a man said Mr Penny contemplatively

Sam was said Bowman

Especially for a drap o drink said the tranter

Good but not religiousgood suggested Mr Penny

The tranter nodded Having at last made the tap and hole quite ready
Now then Suze bring a mug he said Heres luck to us my sonnies

The tap went in and the cider immediately squirted out in a horizontal
shower over Reubens hands knees and leggings and into the eyes and
neck of Charley who having temporarily put off his grief under pressure
of more interesting proceedings was squatting down and blinking near his
father

There tis again said Mrs Dewy

Devil take the hole the cask and Sam Lawson too that good cider
should be wasted like this exclaimed the tranter Your thumb Lend
me your thumb Michael Ram it in here Michael I must get a bigger
tap my sonnies

Idd it cold inthide te hole inquired Charley of Michael as he
continued in a stooping posture with his thumb in the corkhole

What wonderful odds and ends that chiel has in his head to be sure
Mrs Dewy admiringly exclaimed from the distance I lay a wager that he
thinks more about how tis inside that barrel than in all the other parts
of the world put together

All persons present put on a speaking countenance of admiration for the
cleverness alluded to in the midst of which Reuben returned The
operation was then satisfactorily performed when Michael arose and
stretched his head to the extremest fraction of height that his body
would allow of to restraighten his back and shouldersthrusting out
his arms and twisting his features to a mass of wrinkles to emphasize the
relief aquired A quart or two of the beverage was then brought to
table at which all the new arrivals reseated themselves with widespread
knees their eyes meditatively seeking out any speck or knot in the board
upon which the gaze might precipitate itself

Whatever is father abiding out in fuelhouse so long for said the
tranter Never such a man as father for two thingscleaving up old
dead appletree wood and playing the bassviol Ad pass his life
between the two that a would He stepped to the door and opened it

Father

Ay rang thinly from round the corner

Heres the barrel tapped and we all awaiting

A series of dull thuds that had been heard without for some time past
now ceased and after the light of a lantern had passed the window and
made wheeling rays upon the ceiling inside the eldest of the Dewy family
appeared



CHAPTER III THE ASSEMBLED QUIRE


William Dewyotherwise grandfather Williamwas now about seventy yet
an ardent vitality still preserved a warm and roughened bloom upon his
face which reminded gardeners of the sunny side of a ripe
ribstonepippin though a narrow strip of forehead that was protected
from the weather by lying above the line of his hatbrim seemed to
belong to some town man so gentlemanly was its whiteness His was a
humorous and kindly nature not unmixed with a frequent melancholy and
he had a firm religious faith But to his neighbours he had no character
in particular If they saw him pass by their windows when they had been
bottling off old mead or when they had just been called longheaded men
who might do anything in the world if they chose they thought concerning
him Ah theres that goodhearted manopen as a child If they saw
him just after losing a shilling or halfacrown or accidentally letting
fall a piece of crockery they thought Theres that poor weakminded
man Dewy again Ah hes never done much in the world either If he
passed when fortune neither smiled nor frowned on them they merely
thought him old William Dewy

Ah soshere you beAh Michael and Joseph and Johnand you too
Leaf a merry Christmas all We shall have a rare logwood fire
directly Reub to reckon by the toughness of the job I had in cleaving
em As he spoke he threw down an armful of logs which fell in the
chimneycorner with a rumble and looked at them with something of the
admiring enmity he would have bestowed on living people who had been very
obstinate in holding their own Come in grandfather James

Old James grandfather on the maternal side had simply called as a
visitor He lived in a cottage by himself and many people considered
him a miser some rather slovenly in his habits He now came forward
from behind grandfather William and his stooping figure formed a well
illuminated picture as he passed towards the fireplace Being by trade
a mason he wore a long linen apron reaching almost to his toes corduroy
breeches and gaiters which together with his boots graduated in tints
of whitishbrown by constant friction against lime and stone He also
wore a very stiff fustian coat having folds at the elbows and shoulders
as unvarying in their arrangement as those in a pair of bellows the
ridges and the projecting parts of the coat collectively exhibiting a
shade different from that of the hollows which were lined with small
ditchlike accumulations of stone and mortardust The extremely large
sidepockets sheltered beneath wide flaps bulged out convexly whether
empty or full and as he was often engaged to work at buildings far
awayhis breakfasts and dinners being eaten in a strange chimneycorner
by a garden wall on a heap of stones or walking along the roadhe
carried in these pockets a small tin canister of butter a small canister
of sugar a small canister of tea a paper of salt and a paper of
pepper the bread cheese and meat forming the substance of his meals
hanging up behind him in his basket among the hammers and chisels If a
passerby looked hard at him when he was drawing forth any of these My
buttery he said with a pinched smile

Better try over number seventyeight before we start I suppose said
William pointing to a heap of old Christmascarol books on a side table

Wi all my heart said the choir generally

Number seventyeight was always a teaseralways I can mind him ever
since I was growing up a hard boychap

But hes a good tune and worth a mint o practice said Michael

He is though Ive been mad enough wi that tune at times to seize en
and tear en all to linnit Ay hes a splendid carreltheres no
denying that

The first line is well enough said Mr Spinks but when you come to
O thou man you make a mess ot

Well have another go into en and see what we can make of the martel
Halfanhours hammering at en will conquer the toughness of en Ill
warn it

Od rabbit it all said Mr Penny interrupting with a flash of his
spectacles and at the same time clawing at something in the depths of a
large sidepocket If so be I hadnt been as scatterbrained and
thirtingill as a chiel I should have called at the schoolhouse wi a
boot as I cam up along Whatever is coming to me I really cant estimate
at all

The brain has its weaknesses murmured Mr Spinks waving his head
ominously Mr Spinks was considered to be a scholar having once kept a
nightschool and always spoke up to that level

Well I must call with en the first thing tomorrow And Ill empt my
pocket o this last too if you dont mind Mrs Dewy He drew forth a
last and placed it on a table at his elbow The eyes of three or four
followed it

Well said the shoemaker seeming to perceive that the interest the
object had excited was greater than he had anticipated and warranted the
lasts being taken up again and exhibited now whose foot do ye suppose
this last was made for It was made for Geoffrey Days father over at
Yalbury Wood Ah manys the pair o boots heve had off the last Well
when a died I used the last for Geoffrey and have ever since though a
little doctoring was wanted to make it do Yes a very queer natured
last it is now a blieve he continued turning it over caressingly
Now you notice that there pointing to a lump of leather bradded to
the toe thats a very bad bunion that heve had ever since a was a
boy Now this remarkable large piece pointing to a patch nailed to
the side shows a accident he received by the tread of a horse that
squashed his foot amost to a pomace The horseshoe cam fullbutt on
this point you see And so Ive just been over to Geoffreys to know
if he wanted his bunion altered or made bigger in the new pair Im
making

During the latter part of this speech Mr Pennys left hand wandered
towards the cidercup as if the hand had no connection with the person
speaking and bringing his sentence to an abrupt close all but the
extreme margin of the bootmakers face was eclipsed by the circular brim
of the vessel

However I was going to say continued Penny putting down the cup I
ought to have called at the schoolhere he went groping again in the
depths of his pocketto leave this without fail though I suppose the
first thing tomorrow will do

He now drew forth and placed upon the table a bootsmall light and
prettily shapedupon the heel of which he had been operating

The new schoolmistresss

Ay no less Miss Fancy Day as neat a little figure of fun as ever I
see and just husbandhigh

Never Geoffreys daughter Fancy said Bowman as all glances present
converged like wheelspokes upon the boot in the centre of them

Yes sure resumed Mr Penny regarding the boot as if that alone were
his auditor tis she thats come here schoolmistress You knowed his
daughter was in training

Strange isnt it for her to be here Christmas night Master Penny

Yes but here she is a blieve

I know how she comes hereso I do chirruped one of the children

Why Dick inquired with subtle interest

Pason Maybold was afraid he couldnt manage us all tomorrow at the
dinner and he talked o getting her jist to come over and help him hand
about the plates and see we didnt make pigs of ourselves and thats
what shes come for

And thats the boot then continued its mender imaginatively that
shell walk to church in tomorrow morning I dont care to mend boots I
dont make but theres no knowing what it may lead to and her father
always comes to me

There between the cidermug and the candle stood this interesting
receptacle of the little unknowns foot and a very pretty boot it was A
character in factthe flexible bend at the instep the rounded
localities of the small nestling toes scratches from careless scampers
now forgottenall as repeated in the telltale leather evidencing a
nature and a bias Dick surveyed it with a delicate feeling that he had
no right to do so without having first asked the owner of the foots
permission

Now neighbours though no common eye can see it the shoemaker went
on a man in the trade can see the likeness between this boot and that
last although that is so deformed as hardly to recall one of Gods
creatures and this is one of as pretty a pair as youd get for tenand
sixpence in Casterbridge To you nothing but tis fathers voot and
daughters voot to me as plain as houses

I dont doubt theres a likeness Master Pennya mild likenessa
fantastical likeness said Spinks But I hant got imagination enough
to see it perhaps

Mr Penny adjusted his spectacles

Now Ill tell ye what happened to me once on this very point You used
to know Johnson the dairyman William

Ay sure I did

Well twasnt opposite his house but a little lower downby his
paddock in front o Parkmaze Pool I was abearing across towards
Blooms End and lo and behold there was a man just brought out o the
Pool dead he had unrayed for a dip but not being able to pitch it
just there had gone in flop over his head Men looked at en women
looked at en children looked at en nobody knowed en He was covered
wi a sheet but I catched sight of his voot just showing out as they
carried en along I dont care what name that man went by I said in
my way but hes John Woodwards brother I can swear to the family
voot At that very moment up comes John Woodward weeping and teaving
Ive lost my brother Ive lost my brother

Only to think of that said Mrs Dewy

Tis well enough to know this foot and that foot said Mr Spinks
Tis longheaded in fact as far as feet do go I know little tis
trueI say no more but show me a mans foot and Ill tell you that
mans heart

You must be a cleverer feller then than mankind in jineral said the
tranter

Well thats nothing for me to speak of returned Mr Spinks A man
lives and learns Maybe Ive read a leaf or two in my time I dont
wish to say anything large mind you but nevertheless maybe I have

Yes I know said Michael soothingly and all the parish knows that
yeve read sommat of everything amost and have been a great filler of
young folks brains Learnings a worthy thing and yeve got it Master
Spinks

I make no boast though I may have read and thought a little and I
knowit may be from much perusing but I make no boastthat by the time
a mans head is finished tis almost time for him to creep underground
I am over fortyfive

Mr Spinks emitted a look to signify that if his head was not finished
nobodys head ever could be

Talk of knowing people by their feet said Reuben Rot me my
sonnies then if I can tell what a man is from all his members put
together oftentimes

But still look is a good deal observed grandfather William absently
moving and balancing his head till the tip of grandfather Jamess nose
was exactly in a right line with Williams eye and the mouth of a
miniature cavern he was discerning in the fire By the way he
continued in a fresher voice and looking up that young crater the
schoolmisess must be sung to tonight wi the rest If her ear is as
fine as her face we shall have enough to do to be upsides with her

What about her face said young Dewy

Well as to that Mr Spinks replied tis a face you can hardly
gainsay A very good pink face as far as that do go Still only a
face when all is said and done

Come come Elias Spinks say shes a pretty maid and have done wi
her said the tranter again preparing to visit the ciderbarrel



CHAPTER IV GOING THE ROUNDS


Shortly after ten oclock the singingboys arrived at the tranters
house which was invariably the place of meeting and preparations were
made for the start The older men and musicians wore thick coats with
stiff perpendicular collars and coloured handkerchiefs wound round and
round the neck till the end came to hand over all which they just showed
their ears and noses like people looking over a wall The remainder
stalwart ruddy men and boys were dressed mainly in snowwhite
smockfrocks embroidered upon the shoulders and breasts in ornamental
forms of hearts diamonds and zigzags The cidermug was emptied for
the ninth time the musicbooks were arranged and the pieces finally
decided upon The boys in the meantime put the old hornlanterns in
order cut candles into short lengths to fit the lanterns and a thin
fleece of snow having fallen since the early part of the evening those
who had no leggings went to the stable and wound wisps of hay round their
ankles to keep the insidious flakes from the interior of their boots

Mellstock was a parish of considerable acreage the hamlets composing it
lying at a much greater distance from each other than is ordinarily the
case Hence several hours were consumed in playing and singing within
hearing of every family even if but a single air were bestowed on each
There was Lower Mellstock the main village half a mile from this were
the church and vicarage and a few other houses the spot being rather
lonely now though in past centuries it had been the most
thicklypopulated quarter of the parish A mile northeast lay the
hamlet of Upper Mellstock where the tranter lived and at other points
knots of cottages besides solitary farmsteads and dairies

Old William Dewy with the violoncello played the bass his grandson
Dick the treble violin and Reuben and Michael Mail the tenor and second
violins respectively The singers consisted of four men and seven boys
upon whom devolved the task of carrying and attending to the lanterns
and holding the books open for the players Directly music was the
theme old William ever and instinctively came to the front

Now mind neighbours he said as they all went out one by one at the
door he himself holding it ajar and regarding them with a critical face
as they passed like a shepherd counting out his sheep You two counter
boys keep your ears open to Michaels fingering and dont ye go
straying into the treble part along o Dick and his set as ye did last
year and mind this especially when we be in Arise and hail Billy
Chimlen dont you sing quite so raving mad as you fain would and all
o ye whatever ye do keep from making a great scuffle on the ground
when we go in at peoples gates but go quietly so as to strike up all
of a sudden like spirits

Farmer Ledlows first

Farmer Ledlows first the rest as usual

And Voss said the tranter terminatively you keep house here till
about halfpast two then heat the metheglin and cider in the warmer
youll find turned up upon the copper and bring it wi the victuals to
churchhatch as thst know

    

Just before the clock struck twelve they lighted the lanterns and
started The moon in her third quarter had risen since the snowstorm
but the dense accumulation of snowcloud weakened her power to a faint
twilight which was rather pervasive of the landscape than traceable to
the sky The breeze had gone down and the rustle of their feet and
tones of their speech echoed with an alert rebound from every post
boundarystone and ancient wall they passed even where the distance of
the echos origin was less than a few yards Beyond their own slight
noises nothing was to be heard save the occasional bark of foxes in the
direction of Yalbury Wood or the brush of a rabbit among the grass now
and then as it scampered out of their way

Most of the outlying homesteads and hamlets had been visited by about two
oclock they then passed across the outskirts of a wooded park toward
the main village nobody being at home at the Manor Pursuing no
recognized track great care was necessary in walking lest their faces
should come in contact with the lowhanging boughs of the old limetrees
which in many spots formed dense overgrowths of interlaced branches

Times have changed from the times they used to be said Mail regarding
nobody can tell what interesting old panoramas with an inward eye and
letting his outward glance rest on the ground because it was as
convenient a position as any People dont care much about us now Ive
been thinking we must be almost the last left in the county of the old
string players Barrelorgans and the things next door to em that you
blow wi your foot have come in terribly of late years

Ay said Bowman shaking his head and old William on seeing him did
the same thing

Mores the pity replied another Time waslong and merry ago
nowwhen not one of the varmits was to be heard of but it served some
of the quires right They should have stuck to strings as we did and
kept out clarinets and done away with serpents If youd thrive in
musical religion stick to strings says I

Strings be safe soullifters as far as that do go said Mr Spinks

Yet theres worse things than serpents said Mr Penny Old things
pass away tis true but a serpent was a good old note a deep rich note
was the serpent

Clarnets however be bad at all times said Michael Mail One
Christmasyears agone now yearsI went the rounds wi the Weatherbury
quire Twas a hard frosty night and the keys of all the clarnets
frozeah they did freezeso that twas like drawing a cork every time
a key was opened and the players o em had to go into a
hedgerandditchers chimleycorner and thaw their clarnets every now
and then An icicle o spet hung down from the end of every mans
clarnet a span long and as to fingerswell there if yell believe
me we had no fingers at all to our knowing

I can well bring back to my mind said Mr Penny what I said to poor
Joseph Ryme who took the treble part in ChalkNewton Church for twoand
forty year when they thought of having clarnets there Joseph I
said says I depend upont if so be you have them tooting clarnets
youll spoil the whole setout Clarnets were not made for the service
of the Lard you can see it by looking at em I said And what came
ot Why souls the parson set up a barrelorgan on his own account
within two years o the time I spoke and the old quire went to nothing

As far as look is concerned said the tranter I dont for my part see
that a fiddle is much nearer heaven than a clarnet Tis further off
Theres always a rakish scampish twist about a fiddles looks that seems
to say the Wicked One had a hand in making oen while angels be supposed
to play clarnets in heaven or somat like em if ye may believe
picters

Robert Penny you was in the right broke in the eldest Dewy They
should ha stuck to strings Your brassman is a rafting dogwell and
good your reedman is a dab at stirring yewell and good your drumman
is a rare bowelshakergood again But I dont care who hears me say
it nothing will spak to your heart wi the sweetness o the man of
strings

Strings for ever said little Jimmy

Strings alone would have held their ground against all the new comers in
creation True true said Bowman But clarinets was death
Death they was said Mr Penny And harmonions William continued
in a louder voice and getting excited by these signs of approval
harmonions and barrelorgans Ah and groans from Spinks be
miserablewhat shall I call emmiserable

Sinners suggested Jimmy who made large strides like the men and did
not lag behind like the other little boys

Miserable dumbledores

Right William and so they bemiserable dumbledores said the choir
with unanimity

By this time they were crossing to a gate in the direction of the school
which standing on a slight eminence at the junction of three ways now
rose in unvarying and dark flatness against the sky The instruments
were retuned and all the band entered the school enclosure enjoined by
old William to keep upon the grass

Number seventyeight he softly gave out as they formed round in a
semicircle the boys opening the lanterns to get a clearer light and
directing their rays on the books

Then passed forth into the quiet night an ancient and timeworn hymn
embodying a quaint Christianity in words orally transmitted from father
to son through several generations down to the present characters who
sang them out right earnestly

 Remember Adams fall
 O thou Man
 Remember Adams fall
 From Heaven to Hell
 Remember Adams fall
 How he hath condemnd all
 In Hell perpetual
 There for to dwell

 Remember Gods goodnesse
 O thou Man
 Remember Gods goodnesse
 His promise made
 Remember Gods goodnesse
 He sent His Son sinlesse
 Our ails for to redress
 Be not afraid

 In Bethlehem He was born
 O thou Man
 In Bethlehem He was born
 For mankinds sake
 In Bethlehem He was born
 Christmasday i the morn
 Our Saviour thought no scorn
 Our faults to take

 Give thanks to God alway
 O thou Man
 Give thanks to God alway
 With heartmost joy
 Give thanks to God alway
 On this our joyful day
 Let all men sing and say
 Holy Holy

Having concluded the last note they listened for a minute or two but
found that no sound issued from the schoolhouse

Four breaths and then O what unbounded goodness number
fiftynine said William

This was duly gone through and no notice whatever seemed to be taken of
the performance

Good guide us surely tisnt a empty house as befell us in the year
thirtynine and fortythree said old Dewy

Perhaps shes jist come from some musical city and sneers at our
doings the tranter whispered

Od rabbit her said Mr Penny with an annihilating look at a corner
of the school chimney I dont quite stomach her if this is it Your
plain music well done is as worthy as your other sort done bad a
blieve souls so say I

Four breaths and then the last said the leader authoritatively
Rejoice ye Tenants of the Earth number sixtyfour

At the close waiting yet another minute he said in a clear loud voice
as he had said in the village at that hour and season for the previous
forty yearsA merry Christmas to ye



CHAPTER V THE LISTENERS


When the expectant stillness consequent upon the exclamation had nearly
died out of them all an increasing light made itself visible in one of
the windows of the upper floor It came so close to the blind that the
exact position of the flame could be perceived from the outside
Remaining steady for an instant the blind went upward from before it
revealing to thirty concentrated eyes a young girl framed as a picture
by the window architrave and unconsciously illuminating her countenance
to a vivid brightness by a candle she held in her left hand close to her
face her right hand being extended to the side of the window She was
wrapped in a white robe of some kind whilst down her shoulders fell a
twining profusion of marvellously rich hair in a wild disorder which
proclaimed it to be only during the invisible hours of the night that
such a condition was discoverable Her bright eyes were looking into the
grey world outside with an uncertain expression oscillating between
courage and shyness which as she recognized the semicircular group of
dark forms gathered before her transformed itself into pleasant
resolution

Opening the window she said lightly and warmlyThank you singers
thank you

Together went the window quickly and quietly and the blind started
downward on its return to its place Her fair forehead and eyes
vanished her little mouth her neck and shoulders all of her Then the
spot of candlelight shone nebulously as before then it moved away

How pretty exclaimed Dick Dewy

If shed been rale wexwork she couldnt ha been comelier said Michael
Mail

As near a thing to a spiritual vision as ever I wish to see said
tranter Dewy

O sich I never never see said Leaf fervently

All the rest after clearing their throats and adjusting their hats
agreed that such a sight was worth singing for

Now to Farmer Shiners and then replenish our insides father said
the tranter

Wi all my heart said old William shouldering his bassviol

Farmer Shiners was a queer lump of a house standing at the corner of a
lane that ran into the principal thoroughfare The upper windows were
much wider than they were high and this feature together with a broad
baywindow where the door might have been expected gave it by day the
aspect of a human countenance turned askance and wearing a sly and
wicked leer Tonight nothing was visible but the outline of the roof
upon the sky

The front of this building was reached and the preliminaries arranged as
usual

Four breaths and number thirtytwo Behold the Morning Star said
old William

They had reached the end of the second verse and the fiddlers were doing
the up bowstroke previously to pouring forth the opening chord of the
third verse when without a light appearing or any signal being given a
roaring voice exclaimed

Shut up woll ee Dont make your blaring row here A feller wi a
headache enough to split his skull likes a quiet night

Slam went the window

Hullo thats a ugly blow for we said the tranter in a keenly
appreciative voice and turning to his companions

Finish the carrel all who be friends of harmony commanded old
William and they continued to the end

Four breaths and number nineteen said William firmly Give it him
well the quire cant be insulted in this manner

A light now flashed into existence the window opened and the farmer
stood revealed as one in a terrific passion

Drown endrown en the tranter cried fiddling frantically Play
fortissimy and drown his spaking

Fortissimy said Michael Mail and the music and singing waxed so loud
that it was impossible to know what Mr Shiner had said was saying or
was about to say but wildly flinging his arms and body about in the
forms of capital Xs and Ys he appeared to utter enough invectives to
consign the whole parish to perdition

Very onseemlyvery said old William as they retired Never such a
dreadful scene in the whole round o my carrel practicenever And he a
churchwarden

Only a drap o drink got into his head said the tranter Mans well
enough when hes in his religious frame Hes in his worldly frame now
Must ask en to our bit of a party tomorrow night I suppose and so put
en in humour again We bear no mortal man illwill

They now crossed Mellstock Bridge and went along an embowered path
beside the Froom towards the church and vicarage meeting Voss with the
hot mead and breadandcheese as they were approaching the churchyard
This determined them to eat and drink before proceeding further and they
entered the church and ascended to the gallery The lanterns were
opened and the whole body sat round against the walls on benches and
whatever else was available and made a hearty meal In the pauses of
conversation there could be heard through the floor overhead a little
world of undertones and creaks from the halting clockwork which never
spread further than the tower they were born in and raised in the more
meditative minds a fancy that here lay the direct pathway of Time

Having done eating and drinking they again tuned the instruments and
once more the party emerged into the night air

Wheres Dick said old Dewy

Every man looked round upon every other man as if Dick might have been
transmuted into one or the other and then they said they didnt know

Well now thats what I call very nasty of Master Dicky that I do
said Michael Mail

Heve clinked off homealong depend upont another suggested though
not quite believing that he had

Dick exclaimed the tranter and his voice rolled sonorously forth
among the yews

He suspended his muscles rigid as stone whilst listening for an answer
and finding he listened in vain turned to the assemblage

The treble man too Now if hed been a tenor or counter chap we might
ha contrived the rest ot without en you see But for a quire to lose
the treble why my sonnies you may so well lose your     The
tranter paused unable to mention an image vast enough for the occasion

Your head at once suggested Mr Penny

The tranter moved a pace as if it were puerile of people to complete
sentences when there were more pressing things to be done

Was ever heard such a thing as a young man leaving his work half done
and turning tail like this

Never replied Bowman in a tone signifying that he was the last man in
the world to wish to withhold the formal finish required of him

I hope no fatal tragedy has overtook the lad said his grandfather

O no replied tranter Dewy placidly Wonder where hes put that there
fiddle of his Why that fiddle cost thirty shillings and good words
besides Somewhere in the damp without doubt that instrument will be
unglued and spoilt in ten minutesten ay two

What in the name o righteousness can have happened said old William
more uneasily Perhaps hes drownded

Leaving their lanterns and instruments in the belfry they retraced their
steps along the waterside track A strapping lad like Dick dknow
better than let anything happen onawares Reuben remarked Theres
sure to be some poor little scram reason fort staring us in the face all
the while He lowered his voice to a mysterious tone Neighbours have
ye noticed any sign of a scornful woman in his head or suchlike

Not a glimmer of such a body Hes as clear as water yet

And Dicky said he should never marry cried Jimmy but live at home
always along wi mother and we

Ay ay my sonny every lad has said that in his time

They had now again reached the precincts of Mr Shiners but hearing
nobody in that direction one or two went across to the schoolhouse A
light was still burning in the bedroom and though the blind was down
the window had been slightly opened as if to admit the distant notes of
the carollers to the ears of the occupant of the room

Opposite the window leaning motionless against a beech tree was the
lost man his arms folded his head thrown back his eyes fixed upon the
illuminated lattice

Why Dick is that thee What bst doing here

Dicks body instantly flew into a more rational attitude and his head
was seen to turn east and west in the gloom as if endeavouring to
discern some proper answer to that question and at last he said in
rather feeble accentsNothing father

Thst take long enough time about it then upon my body said the
tranter as they all turned anew towards the vicarage

I thought you hadnt done having snap in the gallery said Dick

Why weve been traypsing and rambling about looking everywhere and
thinking youd done fifty deathly things and here have you been at
nothing at all

The stupidness lies in that point of it being nothing at all murmured
Mr Spinks

The vicarage front was their next field of operation and Mr Maybold
the latelyarrived incumbent duly received his share of the nights
harmonies It was hoped that by reason of his profession he would have
been led to open the window and an extra carol in quick time was added
to draw him forth But Mr Maybold made no stir

A bad sign said old William shaking his head

However at that same instant a musical voice was heard exclaiming from
inner depths of bedclothesThanks villagers

What did he say asked Bowman who was rather dull of hearing Bowmans
voice being therefore loud had been heard by the vicar within

I said Thanks villagers cried the vicar again

Oh we didnt hear ee the first time cried Bowman

Now dont for heavens sake spoil the young mans temper by answering
like that said the tranter

You wont do that my friends the vicar shouted

Well to be sure what ears said Mr Penny in a whisper Beats any
horse or dog in the parish and depend upont thats a sign hes a
proper clever chap

We shall see that in time said the tranter

Old William in his gratitude for such thanks from a comparatively new
inhabitant was anxious to play all the tunes over again but renounced
his desire on being reminded by Reuben that it would be best to leave
well alone

Now putting two and two together the tranter continued as they went
their way over the hill and across to the last remaining houses that
is in the form of that young female vision we zeed just now and this
young tenorvoiced parson my belief is shell wind en round her finger
and twist the pore young feller about like the figure of 8that she will
so my sonnies



CHAPTER VI CHRISTMAS MORNING


The choir at last reached their beds and slept like the rest of the
parish Dicks slumbers through the three or four hours remaining for
rest were disturbed and slight an exhaustive variation upon the
incidents that had passed that night in connection with the schoolwindow
going on in his brain every moment of the time

In the morning do what he wouldgo upstairs downstairs out of doors
speak of the wind and weather or what nothe could not refrain from an
unceasing renewal in imagination of that interesting enactment Tilted
on the edge of one foot he stood beside the fireplace watching his
mother grilling rashers but there was nothing in grilling he thought
unless the Vision grilled The limp rasher hung down between the bars of
the gridiron like a cat in a childs arms but there was nothing in
similes unless She uttered them He looked at the daylight shadows of a
yellow hue dancing with the firelight shadows in blue on the whitewashed
chimney corner but there was nothing in shadows Perhaps the new young
womschMiss Fancy Day will sing in church with us this morning he
said

The tranter looked a long time before he replied I fancy she will and
yet I fancy she wont

Dick implied that such a remark was rather to be tolerated than admired
though deliberateness in speech was known to have as a rule more to do
with the machinery of the tranters throat than with the matter
enunciated

They made preparations for going to church as usual Dick with extreme
alacrity though he would not definitely consider why he was so
religious His wonderful nicety in brushing and cleaning his best light
boots had features which elevated it to the rank of an art Every
particle and speck of last weeks mud was scraped and brushed from toe
and heel new blacking from the packet was carefully mixed and made use
of regardless of expense A coat was laid on and polished then another
coat for increased blackness and lastly a third to give the perfect and
mirrorlike jet which the hopedfor rencounter demanded

It being Christmasday the tranter prepared himself with Sunday
particularity Loud sousing and snorting noises were heard to proceed
from a tub in the back quarters of the dwelling proclaiming that he was
there performing his great Sunday wash lasting halfanhour to which
his washings on workingday mornings were mere flashes in the pan
Vanishing into the outhouse with a large brown towel and the abovenamed
bubblings and snortings being carried on for about twenty minutes the
tranter would appear round the edge of the door smelling like a summer
fog and looking as if he had just narrowly escaped a watery grave with
the loss of much of his clothes having since been weeping bitterly till
his eyes were red a crystal drop of water hanging ornamentally at the
bottom of each ear one at the tip of his nose and others in the form of
spangles about his hair

After a great deal of crunching upon the sanded stone floor by the feet
of father son and grandson as they moved to and fro in these
preparations the bassviol and fiddles were taken from their nook and
the strings examined and screwed a little above concertpitch that they
might keep their tone when the service began to obviate the awkward
contingency of having to retune them at the back of the gallery during a
cough sneeze or amenan inconvenience which had been known to arise in
damp wintry weather

The three left the door and paced down Mellstocklane and across the ewe
lease bearing under their arms the instruments in faded greenbaize
bags and old brown musicbooks in their hands Dick continually finding
himself in advance of the other two and the tranter moving on with toes
turned outwards to an enormous angle

At the foot of an incline the church became visible through the north
gate or church hatch as it was called here Seven agile figures in a
clump were observable beyond which proved to be the choristers waiting
sitting on an altartomb to pass the time and letting their heels dangle
against it The musicians being now in sight the youthful party
scampered off and rattled up the old wooden stairs of the gallery like a
regiment of cavalry the other boys of the parish waiting outside and
observing birds cats and other creatures till the vicar entered when
they suddenly subsided into sober churchgoers and passed down the aisle
with echoing heels

The gallery of Mellstock Church had a status and sentiment of its own A
stranger there was regarded with a feeling altogether differing from that
of the congregation below towards him Banished from the nave as an
intruder whom no originality could make interesting he was received
above as a curiosity that no unfitness could render dull The gallery
too looked down upon and knew the habits of the nave to its remotest
peculiarity and had an extensive stock of exclusive information about
it whilst the nave knew nothing of the gallery folk as gallery folk
beyond their loudsounding minims and chest notes Such topics as that
the clerk was always chewing tobacco except at the moment of crying amen
that he had a dusthole in his pew that during the sermon certain young
daughters of the village had left off caring to read anything so mild as
the marriage service for some years and now regularly studied the one
which chronologically follows it that a pair of lovers touched fingers
through a knothole between their pews in the manner ordained by their
great exemplars Pyramus and Thisbe that Mrs Ledlow the farmers wife
counted her money and reckoned her weeks marketing expenses during the
first lessonall news to those belowwere stale subjects here

Old William sat in the centre of the front row his violoncello between
his knees and two singers on each hand Behind him on the left came
the treble singers and Dick and on the right the tranter and the tenors
Farther back was old Mail with the altos and supernumeraries

But before they had taken their places and whilst they were standing in
a circle at the back of the gallery practising a psalm or two Dick cast
his eyes over his grandfathers shoulder and saw the vision of the past
night enter the porchdoor as methodically as if she had never been a
vision at all A new atmosphere seemed suddenly to be puffed into the
ancient edifice by her movement which made Dicks body and soul tingle
with novel sensations Directed by Shiner the churchwarden she
proceeded to the small aisle on the north side of the chancel a spot now
allotted to a throng of Sundayschool girls and distinctly visible from
the galleryfront by looking under the curve of the furthermost arch on
that side

Before this moment the church had seemed comparatively emptynow it was
thronged and as Miss Fancy rose from her knees and looked around her for
a permanent place in which to deposit herselffinally choosing the
remotest cornerDick began to breathe more freely the warm new air she
had brought with her to feel rushings of blood and to have impressions
that there was a tie between her and himself visible to all the
congregation

Ever afterwards the young man could recollect individually each part of
the service of that bright Christmas morning and the trifling
occurrences which took place as its minutes slowly drew along the duties
of that day dividing themselves by a complete line from the services of
other times The tunes they that morning essayed remained with him for
years apart from all others also the text also the appearance of the
layer of dust upon the capitals of the piers that the hollybough in the
chancel archway was hung a little out of the centreall the ideas in
short that creep into the mind when reason is only exercising its lowest
activity through the eye

By chance or by fate another young man who attended Mellstock Church on
that Christmas morning had towards the end of the service the same
instinctive perception of an interesting presence in the shape of the
same bright maiden though his emotion reached a far less developed
stage And there was this difference too that the person in question
was surprised at his condition and sedulously endeavoured to reduce
himself to his normal state of mind He was the young vicar Mr
Maybold

The music on Christmas mornings was frequently below the standard of
churchperformances at other times The boys were sleepy from the heavy
exertions of the night the men were slightly wearied and now in
addition to these constant reasons there was a dampness in the
atmosphere that still further aggravated the evil Their strings from
the recent long exposure to the night air rose whole semitones and
snapped with a loud twang at the most silent moment which necessitated
more retiring than ever to the back of the gallery and made the gallery
throats quite husky with the quantity of coughing and hemming required
for tuning in The vicar looked cross

When the singing was in progress there was suddenly discovered to be a
strong and shrill reinforcement from some point ultimately found to be
the schoolgirls aisle At every attempt it grew bolder and more
distinct At the third time of singing these intrusive feminine voices
were as mighty as those of the regular singers in fact the flood of
sound from this quarter assumed such an individuality that it had a
time a key almost a tune of its own surging upwards when the gallery
plunged downwards and the reverse

Now this had never happened before within the memory of man The girls
like the rest of the congregation had always been humble and respectful
followers of the gallery singing at sixes and sevens if without gallery
leaders never interfering with the ordinances of these practised
artistshaving no will union power or proclivity except it was given
them from the established choir enthroned above them

A good deal of desperation became noticeable in the gallery throats and
strings which continued throughout the musical portion of the service
Directly the fiddles were laid down Mr Pennys spectacles put in their
sheath and the text had been given out an indignant whispering began

Did ye hear that souls Mr Penny said in a groaning breath

Brazenfaced hussies said Bowman

True why they were every note as loud as we fiddles and all if not
louder

Fiddles and all echoed Bowman bitterly

Shall anything saucier be found than united ooman Mr Spinks
murmured

What I want to know is said the tranter as if he knew already but
that civilization required the form of words what business people have
to tell maidens to sing like that when they dont sit in a gallery and
never have entered one in their lives Thats the question my sonnies

Tis the gallery have got to sing all the world knows said Mr Penny
Why souls whats the use o the ancients spending scores of pounds to
build galleries if people down in the lowest depths of the church sing
like that at a moments notice

Really I think we useless ones had better march out of church fiddles
and all said Mr Spinks with a laugh which to a stranger would have
sounded mild and real Only the initiated body of men he addressed could
understand the horrible bitterness of irony that lurked under the quiet
words useless ones and the ghastliness of the laughter apparently so
natural

Never mind Let em sing tootwill make it all the louderhee hee
said Leaf

Thomas Leaf Thomas Leaf Where have you lived all your life said
grandfather William sternly

The quailing Leaf tried to look as if he had lived nowhere at all

When alls said and done my sonnies Reuben said thered have been
no real harm in their singing if they had let nobody hear em and only
jined in now and then

None at all said Mr Penny But though I dont wish to accuse people
wrongfully Id say before my lord judge that I could hear every note o
that last psalm come from em as much as from usevery note as if twas
their own

Know it ah I should think I did know it Mr Spinks was heard to
observe at this moment without reference to his fellow playersshaking
his head at some idea he seemed to see floating before him and smiling
as if he were attending a funeral at the time Ah do I or dont I know
it

No one said Know what because all were aware from experience that what
he knew would declare itself in process of time

I could fancy last night that we should have some trouble wi that young
man said the tranter pending the continuance of Spinkss speech and
looking towards the unconscious Mr Maybold in the pulpit

I fancy said old William rather severely I fancy theres too much
whispering going on to be of any spiritual use to gentle or simple Then
folding his lips and concentrating his glance on the vicar he implied
that none but the ignorant would speak again and accordingly there was
silence in the gallery Mr Spinkss telling speech remaining for ever
unspoken

Dick had said nothing and the tranter little on this episode of the
morning for Mrs Dewy at breakfast expressed it as her intention to
invite the youthful leader of the culprits to the small party it was
customary with them to have on Christmas nighta piece of knowledge
which had given a particular brightness to Dicks reflections since he
had received it And in the tranters slightlycynical nature party
feeling was weaker than in the other members of the choir though
friendliness and faithful partnership still sustained in him a hearty
earnestness on their account



CHAPTER VII THE TRANTERS PARTY


During the afternoon unusual activity was seen to prevail about the
precincts of tranter Dewys house The flagstone floor was swept of
dust and a sprinkling of the finest yellow sand from the innermost
stratum of the adjoining sandpit lightly scattered thereupon Then were
produced large knives and forks which had been shrouded in darkness and
grease since the last occasion of the kind and bearing upon their sides
Shearsteel warranted in such emphatic letters of assurance that the
warranters name was not required as further proof and not given The
key was left in the tap of the ciderbarrel instead of being carried in
a pocket And finally the tranter had to stand up in the room and let
his wife wheel him round like a turnstile to see if anything
discreditable was visible in his appearance

Stand still till Ive been for the scissors said Mrs Dewy

The tranter stood as still as a sentinel at the challenge

The only repairs necessary were a trimming of one or two whiskers that
had extended beyond the general contour of the mass a like trimming of a
slightlyfrayed edge visible on his shirtcollar and a final tug at a
grey hairto all of which operations he submitted in resigned silence
except the last which produced a mild Come come Ann by way of
expostulation

Really Reuben tis quite a disgrace to see such a man said Mrs
Dewy with the severity justifiable in a longtried companion giving him
another turn round and picking several of Smilers hairs from the
shoulder of his coat Reubens thoughts seemed engaged elsewhere and he
yawned And the collar of your coat is a shame to beholdso plastered
with dirt or dust or grease or something Why wherever could you
have got it

Tis my warm nater in summertime I suppose I always did get in such
a heat when I bustle about

Ay the Dewys always were such a coarseskinned family Theres your
brother Bob just as badas fat as a porpoisewi his low mean Howst
do Ann whenever he meets me Id Howst do him indeed If the sun
only shines out a minute there be you all streaming in the faceI never
see

If I be hot weekdays I must be hot Sundays

If any of the girls should turn after their father twill be a bad look
out for em poor things None of my family were sich vulgar sweaters
not one of em But Lordamercy the Dewys I dont know how ever I
cam into such a family

Your womans weakness when I asked ye to jine us Thats how it was I
suppose But the tranter appeared to have heard some such words from
his wife before and hence his answer had not the energy it might have
shown if the inquiry had possessed the charm of novelty

You never did look so well in a pair o trousers as in them she
continued in the same unimpassioned voice so that the unfriendly
criticism of the Dewy family seemed to have been more normal than
spontaneous Such a cheap pair as twas too As big as any man could
wish to have and lined inside and doublelined in the lower parts and
an extra piece of stiffening at the bottom And tis a nice high cut
that comes up right under your armpits and theres enough turned down
inside the seams to make half a pair more besides a piece of cloth left
that will make an honest waistcoatall by my contriving in buying the
stuff at a bargain and having it made up under my eye It only shows
what may be done by taking a little trouble and not going straight to
the rascally tailors

The discourse was cut short by the sudden appearance of Charley on the
scene with a face and hands of hideous blackness and a nose like a
guttering candle Why on that particularly cleanly afternoon he should
have discovered that the chimneycrook and chain from which the hams were
suspended should have possessed more merits and general interest as
playthings than any other articles in the house is a question for
nursing mothers to decide However the humour seemed to lie in the
result being as has been seen that any given player with these articles
was in the longrun daubed with soot The last that was seen of Charley
by daylight after this piece of ingenuity was when in the act of
vanishing from his fathers presence round the corner of the
houselooking back over his shoulder with an expression of great sin on
his face like Cain as the Outcast in Bible pictures

    

The guests had all assembled and the tranters party had reached that
degree of development which accords with ten oclock PM in rural
assemblies At that hour the sound of a fiddle in process of tuning was
heard from the inner pantry

Thats Dick said the tranter That lads crazy for a jig

Dick Now I cannotreally I cannot have any dancing at all till
Christmasday is out said old William emphatically When the clock
ha done striking twelve dance as much as ye like

Well I must say theres reason in that William said Mrs Penny If
you do have a party on Christmasnight tis only fair and honourable to
the skyfolk to have it a sitstill party Jigging parties be all very
well on the Devils holidays but a jigging party looks suspicious now O
yes stop till the clock strikes young folkso say I

It happened that some warm mead accidentally got into Mr Spinkss head
about this time

Dancing he said is a most strengthening livening and courting
movement specially with a little beverage added And dancing is good
But why disturb what is ordained Richard and Reuben and the company
zhinerally Why I ask as far as that do go

Then nothing till after twelve said William

Though Reuben and his wife ruled on social points religious questions
were mostly disposed of by the old man whose firmness on this head quite
counterbalanced a certain weakness in his handling of domestic matters
The hopes of the younger members of the household were therefore
relegated to a distance of one hour and threequartersa result that
took visible shape in them by a remote and listless look about the
eyesthe singing of songs being permitted in the interim

At five minutes to twelve the soft tuning was again heard in the back
quarters and when at length the clock had whizzed forth the last stroke
Dick appeared ready primed and the instruments were boldly handled old
William very readily taking the bassviol from its accustomed nail and
touching the strings as irreligiously as could be desired

The countrydance called the Triumph or Follow my Lover was the
figure with which they opened The tranter took for his partner Mrs
Penny and Mrs Dewy was chosen by Mr Penny who made so much of his
limited height by a judicious carriage of the head straightening of the
back and important flashes of his spectacleglasses that he seemed
almost as tall as the tranter Mr Shiner age about thirtyfive farmer
and churchwarden a character principally composed of a crimson stare
vigorous breath and a watchchain with a mouth hanging on a dark smile
but never smiling had come quite willingly to the party and showed a
wondrous obliviousness of all his antics on the previous night But the
comely slender prettilydressed prize Fancy Day fell to Dicks lot in
spite of some private machinations of the farmer for the reason that Mr
Shiner as a richer man had shown too much assurance in asking the
favour whilst Dick had been duly courteous

We gain a good view of our heroine as she advances to her place in the
ladies line She belonged to the taller division of middle height
Flexibility was her first characteristic by which she appeared to enjoy
the most easeful rest when she was in gliding motion Her dark
eyesarched by brows of so keen slender and soft a curve that they
resembled nothing so much as two slurs in musicshowed primarily a
bright sparkle each This was softened by a frequent thoughtfulness yet
not so frequent as to do away for more than a few minutes at a time
with a certain coquettishness which in its turn was never so decided as
to banish honesty Her lips imitated her brows in their clearlycut
outline and softness of bend and her nose was well shapedwhich is
saying a great deal when it is remembered that there are a hundred
pretty mouths and eyes for one pretty nose Add to this plentiful knots
of darkbrown hair a gauzy dress of white with blue facings and the
slightest idea may be gained of the young maiden who showed amidst the
rest of the dancingladies like a flower among vegetables And so the
dance proceeded Mr Shiner according to the interesting rule laid
down deserted his own partner and made off down the middle with this
fair one of Dicksthe pair appearing from the top of the room like two
persons tripping down a lane to be married Dick trotted behind with
what was intended to be a look of composure but which was in fact a
rather silly expression of featureimplying with too much earnestness
that such an elopement could not be tolerated Then they turned and came
back when Dick grew more rigid around his mouth and blushed with
ingenuous ardour as he joined hands with the rival and formed the arch
over his ladys head which presumably gave the figure its name
relinquishing her again at setting to partners when Mr Shiners new
chain quivered in every link and all the loose flesh upon the
tranterwho here came into action againshook like jelly Mrs Penny
being always rather concerned for her personal safety when she danced
with the tranter fixed her face to a chronic smile of timidity the whole
time it lasteda peculiarity which filled her features with wrinkles
and reduced her eyes to little straight lines like hyphens as she jigged
up and down opposite him repeating in her own person not only his proper
movements but also the minor flourishes which the richness of the
tranters imagination led him to introduce from time to timean
imitation which had about it something of slavish obedience not unmixed
with fear

The earrings of the ladies now flung themselves wildly about turning
violent summersaults banging this way and that and then swinging
quietly against the ears sustaining them Mrs Crumplera heavy woman
who for some reason which nobody ever thought worth inquiry danced in a
clean apronmoved so smoothly through the figure that her feet were
never seen conveying to imaginative minds the idea that she rolled on
castors

Minute after minute glided by and the party reached the period when
ladies backhair begins to look forgotten and dissipated when a
perceptible dampness makes itself apparent upon the faces even of
delicate girlsa ghastly dew having for some time rained from the
features of their masculine partners when skirts begin to be torn out of
their gathers when elderly people who have stood up to please their
juniors begin to feel sundry small tremblings in the region of the
knees and to wish the interminable dance was at Jericho when at
country parties of the thorough sort waistcoats begin to be unbuttoned
and when the fiddlers chairs have been wriggled by the frantic bowing
of their occupiers to a distance of about two feet from where they
originally stood

Fancy was dancing with Mr Shiner Dick knew that Fancy by the law of
good manners was bound to dance as pleasantly with one partner as with
another yet he could not help suggesting to himself that she need not
have put quite so much spirit into her steps nor smiled quite so
frequently whilst in the farmers hands

Im afraid you didnt cast off said Dick mildly to Mr Shiner before
the latter mans watchchain had done vibrating from a recent whirl

Fancy made a motion of accepting the correction but her partner took no
notice and proceeded with the next movement with an affectionate bend
towards her

That Shiners too fond of her the young man said to himself as he
watched them They came to the top again Fancy smiling warmly towards
her partner and went to their places

Mr Shiner you didnt cast off said Dick for want of something else
to demolish him with casting off himself and being put out at the
farmers irregularity

Perhaps I shant cast off for any man said Mr Shiner

I think you ought to sir

Dicks partner a young lady of the name of Lizzycalled Lizz for
shorttried to mollify

I cant say that I myself have much feeling for casting off she said

Nor I said Mrs Penny following up the argument especially if a
friend and neighbour is set against it Not but that tis a terrible
tasty thing in good hands and well done yes indeed so say I

All I meant was said Dick rather sorry that he had spoken
correctingly to a guest that tis in the dance and a man has hardly
any right to hack and mangle what was ordained by the regular
dancemaker who I daresay got his living by making em and thought of
nothing else all his life

I dont like casting off then very well I cast off for no dancemaker
that ever lived

Dick now appeared to be doing mental arithmetic the act being really an
effort to present to himself in an abstract form how far an argument
with a formidable rival ought to be carried when that rival was his
mothers guest The deadlock was put an end to by the stamping arrival
up the middle of the tranter who despising minutiae on principle
started a theme of his own

I assure you neighbours he said the heat of my frame no tongue can
tell He looked around and endeavoured to give by a forcible gaze of
selfsympathy some faint idea of the truth

Mrs Dewy formed one of the next couple

Yes she said in an auxiliary tone Reuben always was such a hot
man

Mrs Penny implied the species of sympathy that such a class of
affliction required by trying to smile and to look grieved at the same
time

If he only walk round the garden of a Sunday morning his shirtcollar
is as limp as no starch at all continued Mrs Dewy her countenance
lapsing parenthetically into a housewifely expression of concern at the
reminiscence

Come come you womenfolk tis hands acrosscome come said the
tranter and the conversation ceased for the present



CHAPTER VIII THEY DANCE MORE WILDLY


Dick had at length secured Fancy for that most delightful of
countrydances opening with sixhandsround

Before we begin said the tranter my proposal is that twould be a
right and proper plan for every mortal man in the dance to pull off his
jacket considering the heat

Such low notions as you have Reuben Nothing but strip will go down
with you when you are adancing Such a hot man as he is

Well now look here my sonnies he argued to his wife whom he often
addressed in the plural masculine for economy of epithet merely I dont
see that You dance and get hot as fire therefore you lighten your
clothes Isnt that nature and reason for gentle and simple If I strip
by myself and not necessary tis rather pothousey I own but if we
stout chaps strip one and all why tis the native manners of the
country which no man can gainsay Heywhat did you say my sonnies

Strip we will said the three other heavy men who were in the dance
and their coats were accordingly taken off and hung in the passage
whence the four sufferers from heat soon reappeared marching in close
column with flapping shirtsleeves and having as common to them all a
general glance of being now a match for any man or dancer in England or
Ireland Dick fearing to lose ground in Fancys good opinion retained
his coat like the rest of the thinner men and Mr Shiner did the same
from superior knowledge

And now a further phase of revelry had disclosed itself It was the time
of night when a guest may write his name in the dust upon the tables and
chairs and a bluish mist pervades the atmosphere becoming a distinct
halo round the candles when peoples nostrils wrinkles and crevices in
general seem to be getting gradually plastered up when the very
fiddlers as well as the dancers get red in the face the dancers having
advanced further still towards incandescence and entered the cadaverous
phase the fiddlers no longer sit down but kick back their chairs and
saw madly at the strings with legs firmly spread and eyes closed
regardless of the visible world Again and again did Dick share his
Loves hand with another man and wheel round then more delightfully
promenade in a circle with her all to himself his arm holding her waist
more firmly each time and his elbow getting further and further behind
her back till the distance reached was rather noticeable and most
blissful swinging to places shoulder to shoulder her breath curling
round his neck like a summer zephyr that had strayed from its proper
date Threading the couples one by one they reached the bottom when
there arose in Dicks mind a minor misery lest the tune should end before
they could work their way to the top again and have anew the same
exciting run down through Dicks feelings on actually reaching the top
in spite of his doubts were supplemented by a mortal fear that the
fiddling might even stop at this supreme moment which prompted him to
convey a stealthy whisper to the fargone musicians to the effect that
they were not to leave off till he and his partner had reached the bottom
of the dance once more which remark was replied to by the nearest of
those convulsed and quivering men by a private nod to the anxious young
man between two semiquavers of the tune and a simultaneous All right
ay ay without opening the eyes Fancy was now held so closely that
Dick and she were practically one person The room became to Dick like a
picture in a dream all that he could remember of it afterwards being the
look of the fiddlers going to sleep as hummingtops sleep by increasing
their motion and hum together with the figures of grandfather James and
old Simon Crumpler sitting by the chimneycorner talking and nodding in
dumbshow and beating the air to their emphatic sentences like people
near a threshing machine

The dance ended Piphhhh said tranter Dewy blowing out his breath
in the very finest stream of vapour that a mans lips could form A
regular tightener that one sonnies He wiped his forehead and went
to the cider and ale mugs on the table

Well said Mrs Penny flopping into a chair my heart havent been in
such a thumping state of uproar since I used to sit up on old Midsummer
eves to see who my husband was going to be

And thats getting on for a good few years ago now from what Ive heard
you tell said the tranter without lifting his eyes from the cup he was
filling Being now engaged in the business of handing round
refreshments he was warranted in keeping his coat off still though the
other heavy men had resumed theirs

And a thing I never expected would come to pass if youll believe me
came to pass then continued Mrs Penny Ah the first spirit ever I
see on a Midsummereve was a puzzle to me when he appeared a hard
puzzle so say I

So I should have fancied said Elias Spinks

Yes said Mrs Penny throwing her glance into past times and talking
on in a running tone of complacent abstraction as if a listener were not
a necessity Yes never was I in such a taking as on that Midsummer
eve I sat up quite determined to see if John Wildway was going to
marry me or no I put the breadandcheese and beer quite ready as the
witchs book ordered and I opened the door and I waited till the clock
struck twelve my nerves all alive and so strained that I could feel
every one of em twitching like bellwires Yes sure and when the
clock had struck lo and behold I could see through the door a little
small man in the lane wi a shoemakers apron on

Here Mr Penny stealthily enlarged himself half an inch

Now John Wildway Mrs Penny continued who courted me at that time
was a shoemaker you see but he was a very fairsized man and I
couldnt believe that any such a little small man had anything to do wi
me as anybody might But on he came and crossed the thresholdnot
John but actually the same little small man in the shoemakers apron

You neednt be so mighty particular about little and small said her
husband

In he walks and down he sits and O my goodness me didnt I flee
upstairs body and soul hardly hanging together Well to cut a long
story short bylong and bylate John Wildway and I had a miff and
parted and lo and behold the coming man came Penny asked me if Id go
snacks with him and afore I knew what I was about amost the thing was
done

Ive fancied you never knew better in your life but I mid be mistaken
said Mr Penny in a murmur

After Mrs Penny had spoken there being no new occupation for her eyes
she still let them stay idling on the past scenes just related which
were apparently visible to her in the centre of the room Mr Pennys
remark received no reply

During this discourse the tranter and his wife might have been observed
standing in an unobtrusive corner in mysterious closeness to each other
a just perceptible current of intelligence passing from each to each
which had apparently no relation whatever to the conversation of their
guests but much to their sustenance A conclusion of some kind having
at length been drawn the palpable confederacy of man and wife was once
more obliterated the tranter marching off into the pantry humming a
tune that he couldnt quite recollect and then breaking into the words
of a song of which he could remember about one line and a quarter Mrs
Dewy spoke a few words about preparations for a bit of supper

That elder portion of the company which loved eating and drinking put on
a look to signify that till this moment they had quite forgotten that it
was customary to expect suppers on these occasions going even further
than this politeness of feature and starting irrelevant subjects the
exceeding flatness and forced tone of which rather betrayed their object
The younger members said they were quite hungry and that supper would be
delightful though it was so late

Good luck attended Dicks lovepasses during the meal He sat next
Fancy and had the thrilling pleasure of using permanently a glass which
had been taken by Fancy in mistake of letting the outer edge of the sole
of his boot touch the lower verge of her skirt and to add to these
delights the cat which had lain unobserved in her lap for several
minutes crept across into his own touching him with fur that had
touched her hand a moment before There were besides some little
pleasures in the shape of helping her to vegetable she didnt want and
when it had nearly alighted on her plate taking it across for his own
use on the plea of waste not want not He also from time to time
sipped sweet sly glances at her profile noticing the set of her head
the curve of her throat and other artistic properties of the lively
goddess who the while kept up a rather free not to say too free
conversation with Mr Shiner sitting opposite which after some uneasy
criticism and much shifting of argument backwards and forwards in Dicks
mind he decided not to consider of alarming significance

A new music greets our ears now said Miss Fancy alluding with the
sharpness that her position as village sharpener demanded to the
contrast between the rattle of knives and forks and the late notes of the
fiddlers

Ay and I dont know but what tis sweeter in tone when you get above
forty said the tranter except in faith as regards father there
Never such a mortal man as he for tunes They do move his soul dont
em father

The eldest Dewy smiled across from his distant chair an assent to
Reubens remark

Spaking of being moved in soul said Mr Penny I shall never forget
the first time I heard the Dead March Twas at poor Corpl Ninemans
funeral at Casterbridge It fairly made my hair creep and fidget about
like a vlock of sheepah it did souls And when they had done and
the last trump had sounded and the guns was fired over the dead heros
grave a icycold drop o moist sweat hung upon my forehead and another
upon my jawbone Ah tis a very solemn thing

Well as to father in the corner there the tranter said pointing to
old William who was in the act of filling his mouth hed starve to
death for musics sake now as much as when he was a boychap of
fifteen

Truly now said Michael Mail clearing the corner of his throat in the
manner of a man who meant to be convincing theres a friendly tie of
some sort between music and eating He lifted the cup to his mouth and
drank himself gradually backwards from a perpendicular position to a
slanting one during which time his looks performed a circuit from the
wall opposite him to the ceiling overhead Then clearing the other
corner of his throat Once I was asetting in the little kitchen of the
Dree Mariners at Casterbridge having a bit of dinner and a brass band
struck up in the street Such a beautiful band as that were I was
setting eating fried liver and lights I well can mindah I was and to
save my life I couldnt help chawing to the tune Band played sixeight
time sixeight chaws I willynilly Band plays common common time went
my teeth among the liver and lights as true as a hair Beautiful twere
Ah I shall never forget that there band

Thats as tuneful a thing as ever I heard of said grandfather James
with the absent gaze which accompanies profound criticism

I dont like Michaels tuneful stories then said Mrs Dewy They are
quite coarse to a person o decent taste

Old Michaels mouth twitched here and there as if he wanted to smile but
didnt know where to begin which gradually settled to an expression that
it was not displeasing for a nice woman like the tranters wife to
correct him

Well now said Reuben with decisive earnestness that sort o coarse
touch thats so upsetting to Anns feelings is to my mind a
recommendation for it do always prove a story to be true And for the
same reason I like a story with a bad moral My sonnies all true
stories have a coarse touch or a bad moral depend upont If the story
tellers could ha got decency and good morals from true stories whod
ha troubled to invent parables Saying this the tranter arose to fetch
a new stock of cider ale mead and homemade wines

Mrs Dewy sighed and appended a remark ostensibly behind her husbands
back though that the words should reach his ears distinctly was
understood by both Such a man as Dewy is Nobody do know the trouble
I have to keep that man barely respectable And did you ever hear
toojust now at suppertimetalking about taties with Michael in such
a workfolk way Well tis what I was never brought up to With our
family twas never less than taters and very often pertatoes
outright mother was so particular and nice with us girls there was no
family in the parish that kept them selves up more than we

The hour of parting came Fancy could not remain for the night because
she had engaged a woman to wait up for her She disappeared temporarily
from the flagging party of dancers and then came downstairs wrapped up
and looking altogether a different person from whom she had been
hitherto in fact to Dicks sadness and disappointment a woman
somewhat reserved and of a phlegmatic temperamentnothing left in her of
the romping girl that she had seemed but a short quarterhour before who
had not minded the weight of Dicks hand upon her waist nor shirked the
purlieus of the mistletoe

What a difference thought the young manhoary cynic pro tem What a
miserable deceiving difference between the manners of a maids life at
dancing times and at others Look at this lovely Fancy Through the
whole past evening touchable squeezeableeven kissable For whole half
hours I held her so chose to me that not a sheet of paper could have been
shipped between us and I could feel her heart only just outside my own
her life beating on so close to mine that I was aware of every breath in
it A flit is made upstairsa hat and a cloak put onand I no more
dare to touch her than Thought failed him and he returned to
realities

But this was an endurable misery in comparison with what followed Mr
Shiner and his watchchain taking the intrusive advantage that ardent
bachelors who are going homeward along the same road as a pretty young
woman always do take of that circumstance came forward to assure
Fancywith a total disregard of Dicks emotions and in tones which were
certainly not frigidthat he Shiner was not the man to go to bed
before seeing his Lady Fair safe within her own doornot he nobody
should say he was thatand that he would not leave her side an inch
till the thing was donedrown him if he would The proposal was
assented to by Miss Day in Dicks foreboding judgment with one
degreeor at any rate an appreciable fraction of a degreeof warmth
beyond that required by a disinterested desire for protection from the
dangers of the night

All was over and Dick surveyed the chair she had last occupied looking
now like a setting from which the gem has been torn There stood her
glass and the romantic teaspoonful of elder wine at the bottom that she
couldnt drink by trying ever so hard in obedience to the mighty
arguments of the tranter his hand coming down upon her shoulder the
while like a Nasmyth hammer but the drinker was there no longer There
were the nine or ten pretty little crumbs she had left on her plate but
the eater was no more seen

There seemed a disagreeable closeness of relationship between himself and
the members of his family now that they were left alone again face to
face His father seemed quite offensive for appearing to be in just as
high spirits as when the guests were there and as for grandfather James
who had not yet left he was quite fiendish in being rather glad they
were gone

Really said the tranter in a tone of placid satisfaction Ive had
so little time to attend to myself all the evenen that I mean to enjoy a
quiet meal now A slice of this here hamneither too fat nor too
leanso and then a drop of this vinegar and picklesthere thats
itand I shall be as fresh as a lark again And to tell the truth my
sonny my inside has been as dry as a limebasket all night

I like a party very well once in a while said Mrs Dewy leaving off
the adorned tones she had been bound to use throughout the evening and
returning to the natural marriage voice but Lord tis such a sight of
heavy work next day What with the dirty plates and knives and forks
and dust and smother and bits kicked off your furniture and I dont
know what all why a body could amost wish there were no such things as
Christmases    Ahh dear she yawned till the clock in the corner
had ticked several beats She cast her eyes round upon the displaced
dustladen furniture and sank down overpowered at the sight

Well I be getting all right by degrees thank the Lord fort said the
tranter cheerfully through a mangled mass of ham and bread without
lifting his eyes from his plate and chopping away with his knife and
fork as if he were felling trees Ann you may as well go on to bed at
once and not bide there making such sleepy faces you look as
longfavoured as a fiddle upon my life Ann There you must be wearied
out tis true Ill do the doors and draw up the clock and you go on
or youll be as white as a sheet tomorrow

Ay I dont know whether I shant or no The matron passed her hand
across her eyes to brush away the film of sleep till she got upstairs

Dick wondered how it was that when people were married they could be so
blind to romance and was quite certain that if he ever took to wife that
dear impossible Fancy he and she would never be so dreadfully practical
and undemonstrative of the Passion as his father and mother were The
most extraordinary thing was that all the fathers and mothers he knew
were just as undemonstrative as his own



CHAPTER IX DICK CALLS AT THE SCHOOL


The early days of the year drew on and Fancy having spent the holiday
weeks at home returned again to Mellstock

Every spare minute of the week following her return was used by Dick in
accidentally passing the schoolhouse in his journeys about the
neighbourhood but not once did she make herself visible A handkerchief
belonging to her had been providentially found by his mother in clearing
the rooms the day after that of the dance and by much contrivance Dick
got it handed over to him to leave with her at any time he should be
near the school after her return But he delayed taking the extreme
measure of calling with it lest had she really no sentiment of interest
in him it might be regarded as a slightly absurd errand the reason
guessed and the sense of the ludicrous which was rather keen in her do
his dignity considerable injury in her eyes and what she thought of him
even apart from the question of her loving was all the world to him now

But the hour came when the patience of love at twentyone could endure no
longer One Saturday he approached the school with a mild air of
indifference and had the satisfaction of seeing the object of his quest
at the further end of her garden trying by the aid of a spade and
gloves to root a bramble that had intruded itself there

He disguised his feelings from some suspiciouslooking cottagewindows
opposite by endeavouring to appear like a man in a great hurry of
business who wished to leave the handkerchief and have done with such
trifling errands

This endeavour signally failed for on approaching the gate he found it
locked to keep the children who were playing crossdadder in the
front from running into her private grounds

She did not see him and he could only think of one thing to be done
which was to shout her name

Miss Day

The words were uttered with a jerk and a look meant to imply to the
cottages opposite that he was now simply one who liked shouting as a
pleasant way of passing his time without any reference to persons in
gardens The name died away and the unconscious Miss Day continued
digging and pulling as before

He screwed himself up to enduring the cottagewindows yet more stoically
and shouted again Fancy took no notice whatever

He shouted the third time with desperate vehemence turning suddenly
about and retiring a little distance as if it were by no means for his
own pleasure that he had come

This time she heard him came down the garden and entered the school at
the back Footsteps echoed across the interior the door opened and
threequarters of the blooming young schoolmistresss face and figure
stood revealed before him a slice on her lefthand side being cut off by
the edge of the door Having surveyed and recognized him she came to
the gate

At sight of him had the pink of her cheeks increased lessened or did it
continue to cover its normal area of ground It was a question meditated
several hundreds of times by her visitor in afterhoursthe meditation
after wearying involutions always ending in one way that it was
impossible to say

Your handkerchief Miss Day I called with He held it out
spasmodically and awkwardly Mother found it under a chair

O thank you very much for bringing it Mr Dewy I couldnt think
where I had dropped it

Now Dick not being an experienced loverindeed never before having
been engaged in the practice of lovemaking at all except in a small
schoolboy waycould not take advantage of the situation and out came
the blunder which afterwards cost him so many bitter moments and a
sleepless night

Good morning Miss Day

Good morning Mr Dewy

The gate was closed she was gone and Dick was standing outside
unchanged in his condition from what he had been before he called Of
course the Angel was not to blamea young woman living alone in a house
could not ask him indoors unless she had known him betterhe should have
kept her outside before floundering into that fatal farewell He wished
that before he called he had realized more fully than he did the pleasure
of being about to call and turned away




PART THE SECONDSPRING


CHAPTER I PASSING BY THE SCHOOL


It followed that as the spring advanced Dick walked abroad much more
frequently than had hitherto been usual with him and was continually
finding that his nearest way to or from home lay by the road which
skirted the garden of the school The firstfruits of his perseverance
were that on turning the angle on the nineteenth journey by that track
he saw Miss Fancys figure clothed in a darkgray dress looking from a
high open window upon the crown of his hat The friendly greeting
resulting from this rencounter was considered so valuable an elixir that
Dick passed still oftener and by the time he had almost trodden a little
path under the fence where never a path was before he was rewarded with
an actual meeting face to face on the open road before her gate This
brought another meeting and another Fancy faintly showing by her
bearing that it was a pleasure to her of some kind to see him there but
the sort of pleasure she derived whether exultation at the hope her
exceeding fairness inspired or the true feeling which was alone Dicks
concern he could not anyhow decide although he meditated on her every
little movement for hours after it was made



CHAPTER II A MEETING OF THE QUIRE


It was the evening of a fine spring day The descending sun appeared as
a nebulous blaze of amber light its outline being lost in cloudy masses
hanging round it like wild locks of hair

The chief members of Mellstock parish choir were standing in a group in
front of Mr Pennys workshop in the lower village They were all
brightly illuminated and each was backed up by a shadow as long as a
steeple the lowness of the source of light rendering the brims of their
hats of no use at all as a protection to the eyes

Mr Pennys was the last house in that part of the parish and stood in a
hollow by the roadside so that cartwheels and horses legs were about
level with the sill of his shopwindow This was low and wide and was
open from morning till evening Mr Penny himself being invariably seen
working inside like a framed portrait of a shoemaker by some modern
Moroni He sat facing the road with a boot on his knees and the awl in
his hand only looking up for a moment as he stretched out his arms and
bent forward at the pull when his spectacles flashed in the passers
face with a shine of flat whiteness and then returned again to the boot
as usual Rows of lasts small and large stout and slender covered the
wall which formed the background in the extreme shadow of which a kind
of dummy was seen sitting in the shape of an apprentice with a string
tied round his hair probably to keep it out of his eyes He smiled at
remarks that floated in from without but was never known to answer them
in Mr Pennys presence Outside the window the upperleather of a
Wellingtonboot was usually hung pegged to a board as if to dry No
sign was over his door in factas with old banks and mercantile
housesadvertising in any shape was scorned and it would have been felt
as beneath his dignity to paint up for the benefit of strangers the
name of an establishment whose trade came solely by connection based on
personal respect

His visitors now came and stood on the outside of his window sometimes
leaning against the sill sometimes moving a pace or two backwards and
forwards in front of it They talked with deliberate gesticulations to
Mr Penny enthroned in the shadow of the interior

I do like a man to stick to men who be in the same line o lifeo
Sundays anywaythat I do so

Tis like all the doings of folk who dont know what a days work is
thats what I say

My belief is the mans not to blame tis sheshes the bitter weed

No not altogether Hes a poor gawkhammer Look at his sermon
yesterday

His sermon was well enough a very good guessable sermon only he
couldnt put it into words and speak it Thats all was the matter wi
the sermon He hadnt been able to get it past his pen

Wellay the sermon might have been good for tis true the sermon of
Old Eccliastes himself lay in Eccliastess inkbottle afore he got it
out

Mr Penny being in the act of drawing the last stitch tight could
afford time to look up and throw in a word at this point

Hes no spouterthat must be said a blieve

Tis a terrible muddle sometimes with the man as far as spout do go
said Spinks

Well well say nothing about that the tranter answered for I dont
believe twill make a penneth o difference to we poor martels here or
hereafter whether his sermons be good or bad my sonnies

Mr Penny made another hole with his awl pushed in the thread and
looked up and spoke again at the extension of arms

Tis his goingson souls thats what it is He clenched his features
for an Herculean addition to the ordinary pull and continued The first
thing he done when he came here was to be hot and strong about church
business

True said Spinks that was the very first thing he done

Mr Penny having now been offered the ear of the assembly accepted it
ceased stitching swallowed an unimportant quantity of air as if it were
a pill and continued

The next thing he do do is to think about altering the church until he
found twould be a matter o cost and what not and then not to think no
more about it

True that was the next thing he done

And the next thing was to tell the young chaps that they were not on no
account to put their hats in the christening font during service

True

And then twas this and then twas that and now tis

Words were not forcible enough to conclude the sentence and Mr Penny
gave a huge pull to signify the concluding word

Now tis to turn us out of the quire neck and crop said the tranter
after an interval of half a minute not by way of explaining the pause
and pull which had been quite understood but as a means of keeping the
subject well before the meeting

Mrs Penny came to the door at this point in the discussion Like all
good wives however much she was inclined to play the Tory to her
husbands Whiggism and vice versa in times of peace she coalesced with
him heartily enough in time of war

It must be owned hes not all there she replied in a general way to
the fragments of talk she had heard from indoors Far below poor Mr
Grinham the late vicar

Ay there was this to be said for he that you were quite sure hed
never come mumbudgeting to see ye just as you were in the middle of your
work and put you out with his fuss and trouble about ye

Never But as for this new Mr Maybold though he mid be a very well
intending party in that respect hes unbearable for as to sifting your
cinders scrubbing your floors or emptying your slops why you cant do
it I assure you Ive not been able to empt them for several days
unless I throw em up the chimley or out of winder for as sure as the
sun you meet him at the door coming to ask how you are and tis such a
confusing thing to meet a gentleman at the door when ye are in the mess
o washing

Tis only for want of knowing better poor gentleman said the tranter
His meanings good enough Ay your pason comes by fate tis heads or
tails like pitchhalfpenny and no choosing so we must take en as he
is my sonnies and thank God hes no worse I suppose

I fancy Ive seen him look across at Miss Day in a warmer way than
Christianity asked for said Mrs Penny musingly but I dont quite
like to say it

O no theres nothing in that said grandfather William

If theres nothing we shall see nothing Mrs Penny replied in the
tone of a woman who might possibly have private opinions still

Ah Mr Grinham was the man said Bowman Why he never troubled us
wi a visit from years end to years end You might go anywhere do
anything youd be sure never to see him

Yes he was a right sensible pason said Michael He never entered
our door but once in his life and that was to tell my poor wifeay
poor soul dead and gone now as we all shallthat as she was such a
old aged person and lived so far from the church he didnt at all
expect her to come any more to the service

And a was a very jinerous gentleman about choosing the psalms and hymns
o Sundays Confound ye says he blare and scrape what ye will but
dont bother me

And he was a very honourable man in not wanting any of us to come and
hear him if we were all onend for a jaunt or spree or to bring the
babies to be christened if they were inclined to squalling Theres good
in a mans not putting a parish to unnecessary trouble

And theres this here man never letting us have a bit o peace but
keeping on about being good and upright till tis carried to such a pitch
as I never see the like afore nor since

No sooner had he got here than he found the font wouldnt hold water as
it hadnt for years off and on and when I told him that Mr Grinham
never minded it but used to spet upon his vinger and christen em just
as well a said Good Heavens Send for a workman immediate What
place have I come to Which was no compliment to us come to that

Still for my part said old William though hes arrayed against us
I like the hearty borussnorus ways of the new pason

You ready to die for the quire said Bowman reproachfully to stick
up for the quires enemy William

Nobody will feel the loss of our churchwork so much as I said the old
man firmly that you dall know Ive abeen in the quire man and boy
ever since I was a chiel of eleven But for all that tisnt in me to
call the man a bad man because I truly and sincerely believe en to be a
good young feller

Some of the youthful sparkle that used to reside there animated Williams
eye as he uttered the words and a certain nobility of aspect was also
imparted to him by the setting sun which gave him a Titanic shadow at
least thirty feet in length stretching away to the east in outlines of
imposing magnitude his head finally terminating upon the trunk of a
grand old oaktree

Maybles a hearty feller enough the tranter replied and will spak to
you be you dirty or be you clane The first time I met en was in a
drong and though a didnt know me no more than the dead a passed the
time of day Dye do he said says he nodding his head A fine
day Then the second time I met en was fullbuff in town street when
my breeches were tore into a long strent by getting through a copse of
thorns and brimbles for a short cut homealong and not wanting to
disgrace the man by spaking in that state I fixed my eye on the
weathercock to let en pass me as a stranger But no How dye do
Reuben says he right hearty and shook my hand If Id been dressed
in silver spangles from top to toe the man couldnt have been civiller

At this moment Dick was seen coming up the villagestreet and they
turned and watched him



CHAPTER III A TURN IN THE DISCUSSION


Im afraid Dicks a lost man said the tranter

Whatno said Mail implying by his manner that it was a far commoner
thing for his ears to report what was not said than that his judgment
should be at fault

Ay said the tranter still gazing at Dicks unconscious advance I
dont at all like what I see Theres too many o them looks out of the
winder without noticing anything too much shining of boots too much
peeping round corners too much looking at the clock telling about
clever things she did till you be sick of it and then upon a hint to
that effect a horrible silence about her Ive walked the path once in
my life and know the country neighbours and Dicks a lost man The
tranter turned a quarter round and smiled a smile of miserable satire at
the setting new moon which happened to catch his eye

The others became far too serious at this announcement to allow them to
speak and they still regarded Dick in the distance

Twas his mothers fault the tranter continued in asking the young
woman to our party last Christmas When I eyed the blue frock and light
heels o the maid I had my thoughts directly God bless thee Dicky my
sonny I said to myself theres a delusion for thee

They seemed to be rather distant in manner last Sunday I thought Mail
tentatively observed as became one who was not a member of the family

Ay thats a part of the zickness Distance belongs to it slyness
belongs to it queerest things on earth belongs to it There tmay as
well come early as late sfar as I know The sooner begun the sooner
over for come it will

The question I ask is said Mr Spinks connecting into one thread the
two subjects of discourse as became a man learned in rhetoric and
beating with his hand in a way which signified that the manner rather
than the matter of his speech was to be observed how did Mr Maybold
know she could play the organ You know we had it from her own lips as
far as lips go that she has never first or last breathed such a thing
to him much less that she ever would play

In the midst of this puzzle Dick joined the party and the news which had
caused such a convulsion among the ancient musicians was unfolded to him
Well he said blushing at the allusion to Miss Day I know by some
words of hers that she has a particular wish not to play because she is
a friend of ours and how the alteration comes I dont know

Now this is my plan said the tranter reviving the spirit of the
discussion by the infusion of new ideas as was his customthis is my
plan if you dont like it no harms done We all know one another very
well dont we neighbours

That they knew one another very well was received as a statement which
though familiar should not be omitted in introductory speeches

Then I say thisand the tranter in his emphasis slapped down his hand
on Mr Spinkss shoulder with a momentum of several pounds upon which
Mr Spinks tried to look not in the least startledI say that we all
move downalong straight as a line to Pason Maybles when the clock has
gone six tomorrow night There we one and all stand in the passage
then one or two of us go in and spak to en man and man and say Pason
Mayble every tradesman dlike to have his own way in his workshop and
Mellstock Church is yours Instead of turning us out neck and crop let
us stay on till Christmas and well gie way to the young woman Mr
Mayble and make no more ado about it And we shall always be quite
willing to touch our hats when we meet ye Mr Mayble just as before
That sounds very well Hey

Proper well in faith Reuben Dewy

And we wont sit down in his house twould be looking too familiar when
only just reconciled

No need at all to sit down Just do our duty man and man turn round
and march outhell think all the more of us for it

I hardly think Leaf had better go wi us said Michael turning to Leaf
and taking his measure from top to bottom by the eye Hes so terrible
silly that he might ruin the concern

He dont want to go much do ye Thomas Leaf said William

Heehee no I dont want to Only a teeny bit

I be mortal afeard Leaf that youll never be able to tell how many
cuts dtake to sharpen a spar said Mail

I never had no head never thats how it happened to happen heehee

They all assented to this not with any sense of humiliating Leaf by
disparaging him after an open confession but because it was an accepted
thing that Leaf didnt in the least mind having no head that deficiency
of his being an unimpassioned matter of parish history

But I can sing my treble continued Thomas Leaf quite delighted at
being called a fool in such a friendly way I can sing my treble as well
as any maid or married woman either and better And if Jim had lived
I should have had a clever brother Tomorrow is poor Jims birthday
Hed ha been twentysix if hed lived till tomorrow

You always seem very sorry for Jim said old William musingly

Ah I do Such a stay to mother as hed always ha been Shed never
have had to work in her old age if he had continued strong poor Jim

What was his age when a died

Four hours and twenty minutes poor Jim A was born as might be at
night and a didnt last as might be till the morning No a didnt
last Mother called en Jim on the day that would ha been his
christening day if he had lived and shes always thinking about en You
see he died so very young

Well twas rather youthful said Michael

Now to my mind that woman is very romantical on the matter o children
said the tranter his eye sweeping his audience

Ah well she mid be said Leaf She had twelve regular one after
another and they all except myself died very young either before they
was born or just afterwards

Pore feller too I suppose thst want to come wi us the tranter
murmured

Well Leaf you shall come wi us as yours is such a melancholy family
said old William rather sadly

I never see such a melancholy family as that afore in my life said
Reuben Theres Leafs mother poor woman Every morning I see her
eyes mooning out through the panes of glass like a potsick
winderflower and as Leaf sings a very high treble and we dont know
what we should do without en for upper G well let en come as a trate
poor feller

Ay well let en come a blieve said Mr Penny looking up as the
pull happened to be at that moment

Now continued the tranter dispersing by a new tone of voice these
digressions about Leaf as to going to see the pason one of us might
call and ask en his meaning and twould be just as well done but it
will add a bit of flourish to the cause if the quire waits on him as a
body Then the great thing to mind is not for any of our fellers to be
nervous so before starting well one and all come to my house and have a
rasher of bacon then every manjack het a pint of cider into his inside
then well warm up an extra drop wi some mead and a bit of ginger every
one take a thimblefuljust a glimmer of a drop mind ye no more to
finish off his inner manand march off to Pason Mayble Why sonnies
a mans not himself till he is fortified wi a bit and a drop We shall
be able to look any gentleman in the face then without shrink or shame

Mail recovered from a deep meditation and downward glance into the earth
in time to give a cordial approval to this line of action and the
meeting adjourned



CHAPTER IV THE INTERVIEW WITH THE VICAR


At six oclock the next day the whole body of men in the choir emerged
from the tranters door and advanced with a firm step down the lane
This dignity of march gradually became obliterated as they went on and
by the time they reached the hill behind the vicarage a faint resemblance
to a flock of sheep might have been discerned in the venerable party A
word from the tranter however set them right again and as they
descended the hill the regular tramp tramp tramp of the united feet
was clearly audible from the vicarage garden At the opening of the gate
there was another short interval of irregular shuffling caused by a
rather peculiar habit the gate had when swung open quickly of striking
against the bank and slamming back into the openers face

Now keep step again will ye said the tranter It looks better and
more becomes the high class of arrant which has brought us here Thus
they advanced to the door

At Reubens ring the more modest of the group turned aside adjusted
their hats and looked critically at any shrub that happened to lie in
the line of vision endeavouring thus to give a person who chanced to
look out of the windows the impression that their request whatever it
was going to be was rather a casual thought occurring whilst they were
inspecting the vicars shrubbery and grassplot than a predetermined
thing The tranter who coming frequently to the vicarage with luggage
coals firewood etc had none of the awe for its precincts that filled
the breasts of most of the others fixed his eyes firmly on the knocker
during this interval of waiting The knocker having no characteristic
worthy of notice he relinquished it for a knot in one of the
doorpanels and studied the winding lines of the grain

O sir please heres Tranter Dewy and old William Dewy and young
Richard Dewy O and all the quire too sir except the boys acome to
see you said Mr Maybolds maidservant to Mr Maybold the pupils of
her eyes dilating like circles in a pond

All the choir said the astonished vicar who may be shortly described
as a goodlooking young man with courageous eyes timid mouth and
neutral nose abandoning his writing and looking at his parlourmaid
after speaking like a man who fancied he had seen her face before but
couldnt recollect where

And they looks very firm and Tranter Dewy do turn neither to the right
hand nor to the left but stares quite straight and solemn with his mind
made up

O all the choir repeated the vicar to himself trying by that simple
device to trot out his thoughts on what the choir could come for

Yes every manjack of em as I be alive The parlourmaid was
rather local in manner having in fact been raised in the same village
Really sir tis thoughted by many in town and country that

Town and countryHeavens I had no idea that I was public property in
this way said the vicar his face acquiring a hue somewhere between
that of the rose and the peony Well It is thought in town and
country that

It is thought that you be going to get it hot and strongexcusen my
incivility sir

The vicar suddenly recalled to his recollection that he had long ago
settled it to be decidedly a mistake to encourage his servant Jane in
giving personal opinions The servant Jane saw by the vicars face that
he recalled this fact to his mind and removing her forehead from the
edge of the door and rubbing away the indent that edge had made
vanished into the passage as Mr Maybold remarked Show them in Jane

A few minutes later a shuffling and jostling reduced to as refined a
form as was compatible with the nature of shuffles and jostles was heard
in the passage then an earnest and prolonged wiping of shoes conveying
the notion that volumes of mud had to be removed but the roads being so
clean that not a particle of dirt appeared on the choirs boots those of
all the elder members being newly oiled and Dicks brightly polished
this wiping might have been set down simply as a desire to show that
respectable men had no wish to take a mean advantage of clean roads for
curtailing proper ceremonies Next there came a powerful whisper from
the same quarter

Now stand stockstill there my sonnies one and all And dont make no
noise and keep your backs close to the wall that company may pass in
and out easy if they want to without squeezing through ye and we two are
enough to go in    The voice was the tranters

I wish I could go in too and see the sight said a reedy voicethat of
Leaf

Tis a pity Leaf is so terrible silly or else he might said another

I never in my life seed a quire go into a study to have it out about the
playing and singing pleaded Leaf and I should like to see it just
once

Very well well let en come in said the tranter Youll be like
chips in porridge 1 Leafneither good nor hurt All right my sonny
come along and immediately himself old William and Leaf appeared in
the room

We took the liberty to come and see ee sir said Reuben letting his
hat hang in his left hand and touching with his right the brim of an
imaginary one on his head Weve come to see ee sir man and man and
no offence I hope

None at all said Mr Maybold

This old aged man standing by my side is father William Dewy by name
sir

Yes I see it is said the vicar nodding aside to old William who
smiled

I thought you mightnt know en without his bassviol the tranter
apologized You see he always wears his best clothes and his bassviol
aSundays and it do make such a difference in a old mans look

And whos that young man the vicar said

Tell the pason yer name said the tranter turning to Leaf who stood
with his elbows nailed back to a bookcase

Please Thomas Leaf your holiness said Leaf trembling

I hope youll excuse his looks being so very thin continued the
tranter deprecatingly turning to the vicar again But tisnt his
fault poor feller Hes rather silly by nature and could never get
fat though hes a excellent treble and so we keep him on

I never had no head sir said Leaf eagerly grasping at this
opportunity for being forgiven his existence

Ah poor young man said Mr Maybold

Bless you he dont mind it a bit if you dont sir said the tranter
assuringly Do ye Leaf

Not Inot a morselhee hee I was afeard it mightnt please your
holiness sir thats all

The tranter finding Leaf get on so very well through his negative
qualities was tempted in a fit of generosity to advance him still
higher by giving him credit for positive ones Hes very clever for a
silly chap goodnow sir You never knowed a young feller keep his
smockfrocks so clane very honest too His ghastly looks is all there
is against en poor feller but we cant help our looks you know sir

True we cannot You live with your mother I think Leaf

The tranter looked at Leaf to express that the most friendly assistant to
his tongue could do no more for him now and that he must be left to his
own resources

Yes sir a widder sir Ah if brother Jim had lived shed have had a
clever son to keep her without work

Indeed poor woman Give her this halfcrown Ill call and see your
mother

Say Thank you sir the tranter whispered imperatively towards Leaf

Thank you sir said Leaf

Thats it then sit down Leaf said Mr Maybold

Yyes sir

The tranter cleared his throat after this accidental parenthesis about
Leaf rectified his bodily position and began his speech

Mr Mayble he said I hope youll excuse my common way but I always
like to look things in the face

Reuben made a point of fixing this sentence in the vicars mind by gazing
hard at him at the conclusion of it and then out of the window

Mr Maybold and old William looked in the same direction apparently
under the impression that the things faces alluded to were there
visible

What I have been thinkingthe tranter implied by this use of the past
tense that he was hardly so discourteous as to be positively thinking it
thenis that the quire ought to be gied a little time and not done
away wi till Christmas as a fair thing between man and man And Mr
Mayble I hope youll excuse my common way

I will I will Till Christmas the vicar murmured stretching the two
words to a great length as if the distance to Christmas might be
measured in that way Well I want you all to understand that I have no
personal fault to find and that I dont wish to change the church music
by forcible means or in a way which should hurt the feelings of any
parishioners Why I have at last spoken definitely on the subject is
that a player has been brought underI may say pressed uponmy notice
several times by one of the churchwardens And as the organ I brought
with me is here waiting pointing to a cabinetorgan standing in the
study there is no reason for longer delay

We made a mistake I suppose then sir But we understood the young
woman didnt want to play particularly The tranter arranged his
countenance to signify that he did not want to be inquisitive in the
least

No nor did she Nor did I definitely wish her to just yet for your
playing is very good But as I said one of the churchwardens has been
so anxious for a change that as matters stand I couldnt consistently
refuse my consent

Now for some reason or other the vicar at this point seemed to have an
idea that he had prevaricated and as an honest vicar it was a thing he
determined not to do He corrected himself blushing as he did so
though why he should blush was not known to Reuben

Understand me rightly he said the churchwarden proposed it to me
but I had thought myself of gettingMiss Day to play

Which churchwarden might that be who proposed her sirexcusing my
common way The tranter intimated by his tone that so far from being
inquisitive he did not even wish to ask a single question

Mr Shiner I believe

Clk my sonnybeg your pardon sir thats only a form of words of
mine and slipped out accidentalhe nourishes enmity against us for some
reason or another perhaps because we played rather hard upon en
Christmas night Anyhow tis certain sure that Mr Shiners real love
for music of a particular kind isnt his reason Heve no more ear than
that chair But let that be

I dont think you should conclude that because Mr Shiner wants a
different music he has any illfeeling for you I myself I must own
prefer organmusic to any other I consider it most proper and feel
justified in endeavouring to introduce it but then although other music
is better I dont say yours is not good

Well then Mr Mayble since deaths to be well die like men any day
you name excusing my common way

Mr Maybold bowed his head

All we thought was that for us old ancient singers to be choked off
quiet at no time in particular as now in the Sundays after Easter
would seem rather mean in the eyes of other parishes sir But if we
fell glorious with a bit of a flourish at Christmas we should have a
respectable end and not dwindle away at some nameless paltry
secondSundayafter or Sundaynextbefore something thats got no name
of his own

Yes yes thats reasonable I own its reasonable

You see Mr Mayble weve gotdo I keep you inconvenient long sir

No no

Weve got our feelingsfather there especially

The tranter in his earnestness had advanced his person to within six
inches of the vicars

Certainly certainly said Mr Maybold retreating a little for
convenience of seeing You are all enthusiastic on the subject and I
am all the more gratified to find you so A Laodicean lukewarmness is
worse than wrongheadedness itself

Exactly sir In fact now Mr Mayble Reuben continued more
impressively and advancing a little closer still to the vicar father
there is a perfect figure o wonder in the way of being fond of music

The vicar drew back a little further the tranter suddenly also standing
back a foot or two to throw open the view of his father and pointing to
him at the same time

Old William moved uneasily in the large chair and with a minute smile on
the mere edge of his lips for goodmanners said he was indeed very fond
of tunes

Now you see exactly how it is Reuben continued appealing to Mr
Maybolds sense of justice by looking sideways into his eyes The vicar
seemed to see how it was so well that the gratified tranter walked up to
him again with even vehement eagerness so that his waistcoatbuttons
almost rubbed against the vicars as he continued As to father if you
or I or any man or woman of the present generation at the time music is
aplaying was to shake your fist in fathers face as may be this way
and say Dont you be delighted with that musicthe tranter went
back to where Leaf was sitting and held his fist so close to Leafs face
that the latter pressed his head back against the wall All right Leaf
my sonny I wont hurt you tis just to show my meaning to Mr
MaybleAs I was saying if you or I or any man was to shake your fist
in fathers face this way and say William your life or your music
hed say My life Now thats fathers nature all over and you see
sir it must hurt the feelings of a man of that kind for him and his bass
viol to be done away wi neck and crop

The tranter went back to the vicars front and again looked earnestly at
his face

True true Dewy Mr Maybold answered trying to withdraw his head and
shoulders without moving his feet but finding this impracticable edging
back another inch These frequent retreats had at last jammed Mr
Maybold between his easychair and the edge of the table

And at the moment of the announcement of the choir Mr Maybold had just
redipped the pen he was using at their entry instead of wiping it he
had laid it on the table with the nib overhanging At the last retreat
his coattails came in contact with the pen and down it rolled first
against the back of the chair thence turning a summersault into the
seat thence falling to the floor with a rattle

The vicar stooped for his pen and the tranter wishing to show that
however great their ecclesiastical differences his mind was not so small
as to let this affect his social feelings stooped also

And have you anything else you want to explain to me Dewy said Mr
Maybold from under the table

Nothing sir And Mr Mayble you be not offended I hope you see our
desire is reason said the tranter from under the chair

Quite quite and I shouldnt think of refusing to listen to such a
reasonable request the vicar replied Seeing that Reuben had secured
the pen he resumed his vertical position and added You know Dewy it
is often said how difficult a matter it is to act up to our convictions
and please all parties It may be said with equal truth that it is
difficult for a man of any appreciativeness to have convictions at all
Now in my case I see right in you and right in Shiner I see that
violins are good and that an organ is good and when we introduce the
organ it will not be that fiddles were bad but that an organ was
better That youll clearly understand Dewy

I will and thank you very much for such feelings sir Piphhhh How
the blood do get into my head to be sure whenever I quat down like
that said Reuben who having also risen to his feet stuck the pen
vertically in the inkstand and almost through the bottom that it might
not roll down again under any circumstances whatever

Now the ancient body of minstrels in the passage felt their curiosity
surging higher and higher as the minutes passed Dick not having much
affection for this errand soon grew tired and went away in the
direction of the school Yet their sense of propriety would probably
have restrained them from any attempt to discover what was going on in
the study had not the vicars pen fallen to the floor The conviction
that the movement of chairs etc necessitated by the search could only
have been caused by the catastrophe of a bloody fight beginning
overpowered all other considerations and they advanced to the door
which had only just fallen to Thus when Mr Maybold raised his eyes
after the stooping he beheld glaring through the door Mr Penny in full
length portraiture Mails face and shoulders above Mr Pennys head
Spinkss forehead and eyes over Mails crown and a fractional part of
Bowmans countenance under Spinkss armcrescentshaped portions of
other heads and faces being visible behind thesethe whole dozen and odd
eyes bristling with eager inquiry

Mr Penny as is the case with excitable bootmakers and men seeing the
vicar look at him and hearing no word spoken thought it incumbent upon
himself to say something of any kind Nothing suggested itself till he
had looked for about half a minute at the vicar

Youll excuse my naming of it sir he said regarding with much
commiseration the mere surface of the vicars face but perhaps you
dont know that your chin have bust out ableeding where you cut yourself
ashaving this morning sir

Now that was the stooping depend upont the tranter suggested also
looking with much interest at the vicars chin Blood always will bust
out again if you hang down the member thats been bleeding

Old William raised his eyes and watched the vicars bleeding chin
likewise and Leaf advanced two or three paces from the bookcase
absorbed in the contemplation of the same phenomenon with parted lips
and delighted eyes

Dear me dear me said Mr Maybold hastily looking very red and
brushing his chin with his hand then taking out his handkerchief and
wiping the place

Thats it sir all right again now a blievea mere nothing said
Mr Penny A little bit of fur off your hat will stop it in a minute if
it should bust out again

Ill let ee have a bit off mine said Reuben to show his good
feeling my hat isnt so new as yours sir and twont hurt mine a
bit

No no thank you thank you Mr Maybold again nervously replied

Twas rather a deep cut seemingly said Reuben feeling these to be the
kindest and best remarks he could make

O no not particularly

Well sir your hand will shake sometimes ashaving and just when it
comes into your head that you may cut yourself theres the blood

I have been revolving in my mind that question of the time at which we
make the change said Mr Maybold and I know youll meet me halfway
I think Christmasday as much too late for me as the present time is too
early for you I suggest Michaelmas or thereabout as a convenient time
for both parties for I think your objection to a Sunday which has no
name is not one of any real weight

Very good sir I suppose mortal men mustnt expect their own way
entirely and I express in all our names that well make shift and be
satisfied with what you say The tranter touched the brim of his
imaginary hat again and all the choir did the same About Michaelmas
then as far as you are concerned sir and then we make room for the
next generation

About Michaelmas said the vicar



CHAPTER V RETURNING HOME WARD


A took it very well then said Mail as they all walked up the hill

He behaved like a man a did so said the tranter And Im glad
weve let en know our minds And though beyond that we hant got much
by going twas worth while He wont forget it Yes he took it very
well Supposing this tree here was Pason Mayble and I standing here
and thik grt stone is father sitting in the easychair Dewy says
he I dont wish to change the church music in a forcible way

That was very nice o the man even though words be wind

Proper niceout and out nice The fact is said Reuben
confidentially tis how you take a man Everybody must be managed
Queens must be managed kings must be managed for men want managing
almost as much as women and thats saying a good deal

Tis truly murmured the husbands

Pason Mayble and I were as good friends all through it as if wed been
sworn brothers Ay the mans well enough tis whats put in his head
that spoils him and thats why weve got to go

Theres really no believing half you hear about people nowadays

Bless ye my sonnies tisnt the pasons move at all That gentleman
over there the tranter nodded in the direction of Shiners farm is at
the root of the mischty

What Shiner

Ay and I see what the pason dont see Why Shiner is for putting
forward that young woman that only last night I was saying was our Dicks
sweetheart but I suppose cant be and making much of her in the sight
of the congregation and thinking hell win her by showing her off Well
perhaps a woll

Then the music is second to the woman the other churchwarden is second
to Shiner the pason is second to the churchwardens and God Amighty is
nowhere at all

Thats true and you see continued Reuben at the very beginning it
put me in a stud as to how to quarrel wi en In short to save my soul
I couldnt quarrel wi such a civil man without belying my conscience
Says he to father there in a voice as quiet as a lambs William you
are a old aged man as all shall be so sit down in my easychair and
rest yourself And down father zot I could fain ha laughed at thee
father for thoust take it so unconcerned at first and then looked so
frightened when the chairbottom sunk in

You see said old William hastening to explain I was scared to find
the bottom gie waywhat should I know o spring bottomsand thought I
had broke it down and of course as to breaking down a mans chair I
didnt wish any such thing

And neighbours when a feller ever so much up for a miff dsee his
own father sitting in his enemys easychair and a poor chap like Leaf
made the best of as if he almost had brainswhy it knocks all the wind
out of his sail at once it did out of mine

If that young figure of funFance Day I mean said Bowman hadnt
been so mighty forward wi showing herself off to Shiner and Dick and the
rest tis my belief we should never ha left the gallery

Tis my belief that though Shiner fired the bullets the parson made
em said Mr Penny My wife sticks to it that hes in love wi her

Thats a thing we shall never know I cant onriddle her nohow

Thoust ought to be able to onriddle such a little chiel as she the
tranter observed

The littler the maid the bigger the riddle to my mind And coming of
such a stock too she may well be a twister

Yes Geoffrey Day is a clever man if ever there was one Never says
anything not he

Never

You might live wi that man my sonnies a hundred years and never know
there was anything in him

Ay one o these upcountry London inkbottle chaps would call Geoffrey
a fool

Ye never find out whats in that man never said Spinks Close ah
he is close He can hold his tongue well That mans dumbness is
wonderful to listen to

Theres so much sense in it Every moment of it is brimmen over wi
sound understanding

A can hold his tongue very cleververy clever truly echoed Leaf A
do look at me as if a could see my thoughts running round like the works
of a clock

Well all will agree that the man can halt well in his talk be it a
long time or be it a short time And though we cant expect his daughter
to inherit his closeness she may have a few dribblets from his sense

And his pocket perhaps

Yes the nine hundred pound that everybody says hes worth but I call
it four hundred and fifty for I never believe more than half I hear

Well heve made a pound or two and I suppose the maid will have it
since theres nobody else But tis rather sharp upon her if shes been
born to fortune to bring her up as if not born for it and letting her
work so hard

Tis all upon his principle A longheaded feller

Ah murmured Spinks twould be sharper upon her if she were born for
fortune and not to it I suffer from that affliction



CHAPTER VI YALBURY WOOD AND THE KEEPERS HOUSE


A mood of blitheness rarely experienced even by young men was Dicks on
the following Monday morning It was the week after the Easter holidays
and he was journeying along with Smart the mare and the light
springcart watching the damp slopes of the hillsides as they streamed
in the warmth of the sun which at this unsettled season shone on the
grass with the freshness of an occasional inspector rather than as an
accustomed proprietor His errand was to fetch Fancy and some
additional household goods from her fathers house in the neighbouring
parish to her dwelling at Mellstock The distant view was darkly shaded
with clouds but the nearer parts of the landscape were whitely illumined
by the visible rays of the sun streaming down across the heavy gray shade
behind

The tranter had not yet told his son of the state of Shiners heart that
had been suggested to him by Shiners movements He preferred to let
such delicate affairs right themselves experience having taught him that
the uncertain phenomenon of love as it existed in other people was not
a groundwork upon which a single action of his own life could be founded

Geoffrey Day lived in the depths of Yalbury Wood which formed portion of
one of the outlying estates of the Earl of Wessex to whom Day was head
gamekeeper timbersteward and general overlooker for this district
The wood was intersected by the highway from Casterbridge to London at a
place not far from the house and some trees had of late years been
felled between its windows and the ascent of Yalbury Hill to give the
solitary cottager a glimpse of the passersby

It was a satisfaction to walk into the keepers house even as a
stranger on a fine spring morning like the present A curl of
woodsmoke came from the chimney and drooped over the roof like a blue
feather in a ladys hat and the sun shone obliquely upon the patch of
grass in front which reflected its brightness through the open doorway
and up the staircase opposite lighting up each riser with a shiny green
radiance and leaving the top of each step in shade

The windowsill of the front room was between four and five feet from the
floor dropping inwardly to a broad low bench over which as well as
over the whole surface of the wall beneath there always hung a deep
shade which was considered objectionable on every ground save one
namely that the perpetual sprinkling of seeds and water by the caged
canary above was not noticed as an eyesore by visitors The window was
set with thicklyleaded diamond glazing formed especially in the lower
panes of knotty glass of various shades of green Nothing was better
known to Fancy than the extravagant manner in which these circular knots
or eyes distorted everything seen through them from the outsidelifting
hats from heads shoulders from bodies scattering the spokes of cart
wheels and bending the straight firtrunks into semicircles The
ceiling was carried by a beam traversing its midst from the side of
which projected a large nail used solely and constantly as a peg for
Geoffreys hat the nail was arched by a rainbowshaped stain imprinted
by the brim of the said hat when it was hung there dripping wet

The most striking point about the room was the furniture This was a
repetition upon inanimate objects of the old principle introduced by
Noah consisting for the most part of two articles of every sort The
duplicate system of furnishing owed its existence to the forethought of
Fancys mother exercised from the date of Fancys birthday onwards The
arrangement spoke for itself nobody who knew the tone of the household
could look at the goods without being aware that the second set was a
provision for Fancy when she should marry and have a house of her own
The most noticeable instance was a pair of greenfaced eightday clocks
ticking alternately which were severally two and half minutes and three
minutes striking the hour of twelve one proclaiming in Italian
flourishes Thomas Wood as the name of its maker and the otherarched
at the top and altogether of more cynical appearancethat of Ezekiel
Saunders They were two departed clockmakers of Casterbridge whose
desperate rivalry throughout their lives was nowhere more emphatically
perpetuated than here at Geoffreys These chief specimens of the
marriage provision were supported on the right by a couple of kitchen
dressers each fitted complete with their cups dishes and plates in
their turn followed by two dumbwaiters two family Bibles two warming
pans and two intermixed sets of chairs

But the position last reachedthe chimneycornerwas after all the
most attractive side of the parallelogram It was large enough to admit
in addition to Geoffrey himself Geoffreys wife her chair and her work
table entirely within the line of the mantel without danger or even
inconvenience from the heat of the fire and was spacious enough overhead
to allow of the insertion of wood poles for the hanging of bacon which
were cloaked with long shreds of soot floating on the draught like the
tattered banners on the walls of ancient aisles

These points were common to most chimney corners of the neighbourhood
but one feature there was which made Geoffreys fireside not only an
object of interest to casual aristocratic visitorsto whom every cottage
fireside was more or less a curiositybut the admiration of friends who
were accustomed to fireplaces of the ordinary hamlet model This
peculiarity was a little window in the chimneyback almost over the
fire around which the smoke crept caressingly when it left the
perpendicular course The windowboard was curiously stamped with black
circles burnt thereon by the heated bottoms of drinkingcups which had
rested there after previously standing on the hot ashes of the hearth for
the purpose of warming their contents the result giving to the ledge the
look of an envelope which has passed through innumerable postoffices

Fancy was gliding about the room preparing dinner her head inclining now
to the right now to the left and singing the tips and ends of tunes
that sprang up in her mind like mushrooms The footsteps of Mrs Day
could be heard in the room overhead Fancy went finally to the door

Father Dinner

A tall spare figure was seen advancing by the window with periodical
steps and the keeper entered from the garden He appeared to be a man
who was always looking down as if trying to recollect something he said
yesterday The surface of his face was fissured rather than wrinkled
and over and under his eyes were folds which seemed as a kind of exterior
eyelids His nose had been thrown backwards by a blow in a poaching
fray so that when the sun was low and shining in his face people could
see far into his head There was in him a quiet grimness which would in
his moments of displeasure have become surliness had it not been
tempered by honesty of soul and which was often wrongheadedness because
not allied with subtlety

Although not an extraordinarily taciturn man among friends slightly
richer than himself he never wasted words upon outsiders and to his
trapper Enoch his ideas were seldom conveyed by any other means than nods
and shakes of the head Their long acquaintance with each others ways
and the nature of their labours rendered words between them almost
superfluous as vehicles of thought whilst the coincidence of their
horizons and the astonishing equality of their social views by
startling the keeper from time to time as very damaging to the theory of
master and man strictly forbade any indulgence in words as courtesies

Behind the keeper came Enoch who had been assisting in the garden at
the wellconsidered chronological distance of three minutesan interval
of nonappearance on the trappers part not arrived at without some
reflection Four minutes had been found to express indifference to
indoor arrangements and simultaneousness had implied too great an
anxiety about meals

A little earlier than usual Fancy the keeper said as he sat down and
looked at the clocks That Ezekiel Saunders o thine is tearing on
afore Thomas Wood again

I kept in the middle between them said Fancy also looking at the two
clocks

Better stick to Thomas said her father Theres a healthy beat in
Thomas that would lead a man to swear by en offhand He is as true as
the town time How is it your stapmother isnt here

As Fancy was about to reply the rattle of wheels was heard and Weh
hey Smart in Mr Richard Dewys voice rolled into the cottage from
round the corner of the house

Hullo theres Dewys cart come for thee FancyDick drivingafore
time too Well ask the lad to have potluck with us

Dick on entering made a point of implying by his general bearing that he
took an interest in Fancy simply as in one of the same race and country
as himself and they all sat down Dick could have wished her manner had
not been so entirely free from all apparent consciousness of those
accidental meetings of theirs but he let the thought pass Enoch sat
diagonally at a table afar off under the corner cupboard and drank his
cider from a long perpendicular pint cup having tall firtrees done in
brown on its sides He threw occasional remarks into the general tide of
conversation and with this advantage to himself that he participated in
the pleasures of a talk slight as it was at mealtimes without
saddling himself with the responsibility of sustaining it

Why dont your stapmother come down Fancy said Geoffrey Youll
excuse her Mister Dick shes a little queer sometimes

O yesquite said Richard as if he were in the habit of excusing
people every day

She dbelong to that class of womankind that become second wives a rum
class rather

Indeed said Dick with sympathy for an indefinite something

Yes and tis trying to a female especially if youve been a first
wife as she hev

Very trying it must be

Yes you see her first husband was a young man who let her go too far
in fact she used to kick up Bobsadying at the least thing in the
world And when Id married her and found it out I thought thinks I
Tis too late now to begin to cure e and so I let her bide But
shes queervery queer at times

Im sorry to hear that

Yes there wives be such a provoking class o society because though
they be never right they be never more than half wrong

Fancy seemed uneasy under the infliction of this household moralizing
which might tend to damage the airyfairy nature that Dick as maiden
shrewdness told her had accredited her with Her dead silence impressed
Geoffrey with the notion that something in his words did not agree with
her educated ideas and he changed the conversation

Did Fred Shiner send the cask o drink Fancy

I think he did O yes he did

Nice solid feller Fred Shiner said Geoffrey to Dick as he helped
himself to gravy bringing the spoon round to his plate by way of the
potatodish to obviate a stain on the cloth in the event of a spill

Now Geoffreys eyes had been fixed upon his plate for the previous four
or five minutes and in removing them he had only carried them to the
spoon which from its fulness and the distance of its transit
necessitated a steady watching through the whole of the route Just as
intently as the keepers eyes had been fixed on the spoon Fancys had
been fixed on her fathers without premeditation or the slightest phase
of furtiveness but there they were fastened This was the reason why

Dick was sitting next to her on the right side and on the side of the
table opposite to her father Fancy had laid her right hand lightly down
upon the tablecloth for an instant and to her alarm Dick after
dropping his fork and brushing his forehead as a reason flung down his
own left hand overlapping a third of Fancys with it and keeping it
there So the innocent Fancy instead of pulling her hand from the trap
settled her eyes on her fathers to guard against his discovery of this
perilous game of Dicks Dick finished his mouthful Fancy finished her
crumb and nothing was done beyond watching Geoffreys eyes Then the
hands slid apart Fancys going over six inches of cloth Dicks over
one Geoffreys eye had risen

I said Fred Shiner is a nice solid feller he repeated more
emphatically

He is yes he is stammered Dick but to me he is little more than a
stranger

O sure Now I know en as well as any man can be known And you know
en very well too dont ye Fancy

Geoffrey put on a tone expressing that these words signified at present
about one hundred times the amount of meaning they conveyed literally

Dick looked anxious

Will you pass me some bread said Fancy in a flurry the red of her
face becoming slightly disordered and looking as solicitous as a human
being could look about a piece of bread

Ay that I will replied the unconscious Geoffrey Ay he continued
returning to the displaced idea we are likely to remain friendly wi
Mr Shiner if the wheels drun smooth

An excellent thinga very capital thing as I should say the youth
answered with exceeding relevance considering that his thoughts instead
of following Geoffreys remark were nestling at a distance of about two
feet on his left the whole time

A young womans face will turn the north wind Master Richard my heart
if twont Dick looked more anxious and was attentive in earnest at
these words Yes turn the north wind added Geoffrey after an
impressive pause And though shes one of my own flesh and blood   


Will you fetch down a bit of rawmil cheese from pantryshelf Fancy
interrupted as if she were famishing

Ay that I will chiel chiel says I and Mr Shiner only asking last
Saturday night    cheese you said Fancy

Dick controlled his emotion at these mysterious allusions to Mr
Shinerthe better enabled to do so by perceiving that Fancys heart
went not with her fathersand spoke like a stranger to the affairs of
the neighbourhood Yes theres a great deal to be said upon the power
of maiden faces in settling your courses he ventured as the keeper
retreated for the cheese

The conversation is taking a very strange turn nothing that I have ever
done warrants such things being said murmured Fancy with emphasis just
loud enough to reach Dicks ears

You think to yourself twas to be cried Enoch from his distant
corner by way of filling up the vacancy caused by Geoffreys momentary
absence And so you marry her Master Dewy and theres an end ot

Pray dont say such things Enoch came from Fancy severely upon which
Enoch relapsed into servitude

If we be doomed to marry we marry if we be doomed to remain single we
do replied Dick

Geoffrey had by this time sat down again and he now made his lips thin
by severely straining them across his gums and looked out of the window
along the vista to the distant highway up Yalbury Hill Thats not the
case with some folk he said at length as if he read the words on a
board at the further end of the vista

Fancy looked interested and Dick said No

Theres that wife o mine It was her doom to be nobodys wife at all
in the wide universe But she made up her mind that she would and did
it twice over Doom Doom is nothing beside a elderly womanquite a
chiel in her hands

A movement was now heard along the upstairs passage and footsteps
descending The door at the foot of the stairs opened and the second
Mrs Day appeared in view looking fixedly at the table as she advanced
towards it with apparent obliviousness of the presence of any other
human being than herself In short if the table had been the
personages and the persons the table her glance would have been the
most natural imaginable

She showed herself to possess an ordinary womans face irongrey hair
hardly any hips and a great deal of cleanliness in a broad white apron
string as it appeared upon the waist of her dark stuff dress

People will run away with a story now I suppose she began saying
that Jane Days tablecloths are as poor and ragged as any union
beggars

Dick now perceived that the tablecloth was a little the worse for wear
and reflecting for a moment concluded that people in stepmother
language probably meant himself On lifting his eyes he found that Mrs
Day had vanished again upstairs and presently returned with an armful of
new damasklinen tablecloths folded square and hard as boards by long
compression These she flounced down into a chair then took one shook
it out from its folds and spread it on the table by instalments
transferring the plates and dishes one by one from the old to the new
cloth

And I suppose theyll say too that she hant a decent knife and fork
in her house

I shouldnt say any such illnatured thing I am sure began Dick But
Mrs Day had vanished into the next room Fancy appeared distressed

Very strange woman isnt she said Geoffrey quietly going on with his
dinner But tis too late to attempt curing My heart tis so growed
into her that twould kill her to take it out Ay shes very queer
youd be amazed to see what valuable goods weve got stowed away
upstairs

Back again came Mrs Day with a box of bright steel hornhandled knives
silverplated forks carver and all complete These were wiped of the
preservative oil which coated them and then a knife and fork were laid
down to each individual with a bang the carving knife and fork thrust
into the meat dish and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away

Geoffrey placidly cut a slice with the new knife and fork and asked Dick
if he wanted any more

The table had been spread for the mixed midday meal of dinner and tea
which was common among frugal countryfolk The parishioners about
here continued Mrs Day not looking at any living being but snatching
up the brown delf teathings are the laziest gossipest poachest
jailest set of any ever I came among And theyll talk about my teapot
and teathings next I suppose She vanished with the teapot cups and
saucers and reappeared with a teaservice in white china and a packet
wrapped in brown paper This was removed together with folds of tissue
paper underneath and a brilliant silver teapot appeared

Ill help to put the things right said Fancy soothingly and rising
from her seat I ought to have laid out better things I suppose But
here she enlarged her looks so as to include Dick I have been away
from home a good deal and I make shocking blunders in my housekeeping
Smiles and suavity were then dispensed all around by this bright little
bird

After a little more preparation and modification Mrs Day took her seat
at the head of the table and during the latter or tea division of the
meal presided with much composure It may cause some surprise to learn
that now her vagary was over she showed herself to be an excellent
person with much common sense and even a religious seriousness of tone
on matters pertaining to her afflictions



CHAPTER VII DICK MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL


The effect of Geoffreys incidental allusions to Mr Shiner was to
restrain a considerable flow of spontaneous chat that would otherwise
have burst from young Dewy along the drive homeward And a certain
remark he had hazarded to her in rather too blunt and eager a manner
kept the young lady herself even more silent than Dick On both sides
there was an unwillingness to talk on any but the most trivial subjects
and their sentences rarely took a larger form than could be expressed in
two or three words

Owing to Fancy being later in the day than she had promised the
charwoman had given up expecting her whereupon Dick could do no less
than stay and see her comfortably tided over the disagreeable time of
entering and establishing herself in an empty house after an absence of a
week The additional furniture and utensils that had been brought a
canary and cage among the rest were taken out of the vehicle and the
horse was unharnessed and put in the plot opposite where there was some
tender grass Dick lighted the fire already laid and activity began to
loosen their tongues a little

There said Fancy we forgot to bring the fireirons

She had originally found in her sittingroom to bear out the expression
nearly furnished which the schoolmanager had used in his letter to
her a table three chairs a fender and a piece of carpet This
nearly had been supplemented hitherto by a kind friend who had lent
her fireirons and crockery until she should fetch some from home

Dick attended to the young ladys fire using his whiphandle for a poker
till it was spoilt and then flourishing a hurdle stick for the remainder
of the time

The kettle boils now you shall have a cup of tea said Fancy diving
into the hamper she had brought

Thank you said Dick whose drive had made him ready for some
especially in her company

Well heres only one cupandsaucer as I breathe Whatever could
mother be thinking about Do you mind making shift Mr Dewy

Not at all Miss Day said that civil person

And only having a cup by itself or a saucer by itself

Dont mind in the least

Which do you mean by that

I mean the cup if you like the saucer

And the saucer if I like the cup

Exactly Miss Day

Thank you Mr Dewy for I like the cup decidedly Stop a minute there
are no spoons now She dived into the hamper again and at the end of
two or three minutes looked up and said I suppose you dont mind if I
cant find a spoon

Not at all said the agreeable Richard

The fact is the spoons have slipped down somewhere right under the
other things O yes heres one and only one You would rather have
one than not I suppose Mr Dewy

Rather not I never did care much about spoons

Then Ill have it I do care about them You must stir up your tea
with a knife Would you mind lifting the kettle off that it may not
boil dry

Dick leapt to the fireplace and earnestly removed the kettle

There you did it so wildly that you have made your hand black We
always use kettleholders didnt you learn housewifery as far as that
Mr Dewy Well never mind the soot on your hand Come here I am
going to rinse mine too

They went to a basin she had placed in the back room This is the only
basin I have she said Turn up your sleeves and by that time my
hands will be washed and you can come

Her hands were in the water now O how vexing she exclaimed
Theres not a drop of water left for you unless you draw it and the
well is I dont know how many furlongs deep all that was in the pitcher
I used for the kettle and this basin Do you mind dipping the tips of
your fingers in the same

Not at all And to save time I wont wait till you have done if you
have no objection

Thereupon he plunged in his hands and they paddled together It being
the first time in his life that he had touched female fingers under
water Dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one

Really I hardly know which are my own hands and which are yours they
have got so mixed up together she said withdrawing her own very
suddenly

It doesnt matter at all said Dick at least as far as I am
concerned

There no towel Whoever thinks of a towel till the hands are wet

Nobody

Nobody How very dull it is when people are so friendly Come here
Mr Dewy Now do you think you could lift the lid of that box with your
elbow and then with something or other take out a towel you will find
under the clean clothes Be sure dont touch any of them with your wet
hands for the things at the top are all Starched and Ironed

Dick managed by the aid of a knife and fork to extract a towel from
under a muslin dress without wetting the latter and for a moment he
ventured to assume a tone of criticism

I fear for that dress he said as they wiped their hands together

What said Miss Day looking into the box at the dress alluded to O
I know what you meanthat the vicar will never let me wear muslin

Yes

Well I know it is condemned by all orders in the church as flaunting
and unfit for common wear for girls whove their living to get but well
see

In the interest of the church I hope you dont speak seriously

Yes I do but well see There was a comely determination on her lip
very pleasant to a beholder who was neither bishop priest nor deacon
I think I can manage any vicars views about me if hes under forty

Dick rather wished she had never thought of managing vicars

I certainly shall be glad to get some of your delicious tea he said in
rather a free way yet modestly as became one in a position between that
of visitor and inmate and looking wistfully at his lonely saucer

So shall I Now is there anything else we want Mr Dewy

I really think theres nothing else Miss Day

She prepared to sit down looking musingly out of the window at Smarts
enjoyment of the rich grass Nobody seems to care about me she
murmured with large lost eyes fixed upon the sky beyond Smart

Perhaps Mr Shiner does said Dick in the tone of a slightly injured
man

Yes I forgothe does I know Dick precipitately regretted that he
had suggested Shiner since it had produced such a miserable result as
this

Ill warrant youll care for somebody very much indeed another day
wont you Mr Dewy she continued looking very feelingly into the
mathematical centre of his eyes

Ah Ill warrant I shall said Dick feelingly too and looking back
into her dark pupils whereupon they were turned aside

I meant she went on preventing him from speaking just as he was going
to narrate a forcible story about his feelings I meant that nobody
comes to see if I have returnednot even the vicar

If you want to see him Ill call at the vicarage directly we have had
some tea

No no Dont let him come down here whatever you do whilst I am in
such a state of disarrangement Parsons look so miserable and awkward
when ones house is in a muddle walking about and making impossible
suggestions in quaint academic phrases till your flesh creeps and you
wish them dead Do you take sugar

Mr Maybold was at this instant seen coming up the path

There Thats he coming How I wish you were not herethat is how
awkwarddear dear she exclaimed with a quick ascent of blood to her
face and irritated with Dick rather than the vicar as it seemed

Pray dont be alarmed on my account Miss Daygoodafternoon said
Dick in a huff putting on his hat and leaving the room hastily by the
backdoor

The horse was caught and put in and on mounting the shafts to start he
saw through the window the vicar standing upon some books piled in a
chair and driving a nail into the wall Fancy with a demure glance
holding the canarycage up to him as if she had never in her life
thought of anything but vicars and canaries



CHAPTER VIII DICK MEETS HIS FATHER


For several minutes Dick drove along homeward with the inner eye of
reflection so anxiously set on his passages at arms with Fancy that the
road and scenery were as a thin mist over the real pictures of his mind
Was she a coquette The balance between the evidence that she did love
him and that she did not was so nicely struck that his opinion had no
stability She had let him put his hand upon hers she had allowed her
gaze to drop plumb into the depths of hishis into hersthree or four
times her manner had been very free with regard to the basin and towel
she had appeared vexed at the mention of Shiner On the other hand she
had driven him about the house like a quiet dog or cat said Shiner cared
for her and seemed anxious that Mr Maybold should do the same

Thinking thus as he neared the handpost at Mellstock Cross sitting on
the front board of the spring carthis legs on the outside and his
whole frame jigging up and down like a candleflame to the time of
Smarts trottingwho should he see coming down the hill but his father
in the light wagon quivering up and down on a smaller scale of shakes
those merely caused by the stones in the road They were soon crossing
each others front

Wehhey said the tranter to Smiler

Wehhey said Dick to Smart in an echo of the same voice

Thst hauled her back I suppose Reuben inquired peaceably

Yes said Dick with such a clinching period at the end that it seemed
he was never going to add another word Smiler thinking this the close
of the conversation prepared to move on

Wehhey said the tranter I tell thee what it is Dick That there
maid is taking up thy thoughts more thans good for thee my sonny
Thourt never happy now unless thrt making thyself miserable about her
in one way or another

I dont know about that father said Dick rather stupidly

But I doWey SmilerOd rot the women tis nothing else wi em
nowadays but getting young men and leading em astray

Pooh father you just repeat what all the common world says thats all
you do

The worlds a very sensible feller on things in jineral Dick very
sensible indeed

Dick looked into the distance at a vast expanse of mortgaged estate I
wish I was as rich as a squire when hes as poor as a crow he murmured
Id soon ask Fancy something

I wish so too wi all my heart sonny that I do Well mind what
beest about thats all

Smart moved on a step or two Supposing now fatherWehey SmartI
did think a little about her and I had a chance which I hant dont
you think shes a very good sort ofofone

Ay good shes good enough When youve made up your mind to marry
take the first respectable body that comes to handshes as good as any
other they be all alike in the groundwork tis only in the flourishes
theres a difference Shes good enough but I cant see what the nation
a young feller like youwi a comfortable house and home and father and
mother to take care o thee and who sent ee to a school so good that
twas hardly fair to the other childrenshould want to go hollering
after a young woman for when shes quietly making a husband in her
pocket and not troubled by chick nor chiel to make a povertystric
wife and family of her and neither hat cap wig nor waistcoat to set
em up with be drowned if I can see it and thats the long and the
short ot my sonny

Dick looked at Smarts ears then up the hill but no reason was
suggested by any object that met his gaze

For about the same reason that you did father I suppose

Dang it my sonny thoust got me there And the tranter gave vent to
a grim admiration with the mien of a man who was too magnanimous not to
appreciate artistically a slight rap on the knuckles even if they were
his own

Whether or no said Dick I asked her a thing going along the road

Come to that is it Turk wont thy mother be in a taking Well
shes ready I dont doubt

I didnt ask her anything about having me and if youll let me speak
Ill tell ee what I want to know I just said Did she care about me

Piphphph

And then she said nothing for a quarter of a mile and then she said she
didnt know Now what I want to know is what was the meaning of that
speech The latter words were spoken resolutely as if he didnt care
for the ridicule of all the fathers in creation

The meaning of that speech is the tranter replied deliberately that
the meaning is meant to be rather hid at present Well Dick as an
honest father to thee I dont pretend to deny what you dknow well
enough that is that her father being rather better in the pocket than
we I should welcome her ready enough if it must be somebody

But what dye think she really did mean said the unsatisfied Dick

Im afeard I am not o much account in guessing especially as I was not
there when she said it and seeing that your mother was the only ooman I
ever cam into such close quarters as that with

And what did mother say to you when you asked her said Dick musingly

I dont see that that will help ee

The principle is the same

Wellay what did she say Lets see I was oiling my workingday
boots without taking em off and wi my head hanging down when she just
brushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf Ann I said
says I and thenbut Dick Im afeard twill be no help to thee for we
were such a rum couple your mother and I leastways one half was that
is myselfand your mothers charms was more in the manner than the
material

Never mind Ann said you

Ann said I as I was saying    Ann I said to her when I was
oiling my workingday boots wi my head hanging down Woot hae me  
 What came next I cant quite call up at this distance o time Perhaps
your mother would knowshes got a better memory for her little
triumphs than I However the long and the short o the story is that we
were married somehow as I found afterwards Twas on White
TuesdayMellstock Club walked the same day every man two and two and
a fine day twashot as firehow the sun did strike down upon my back
going to church I well can mind what a bath o sweating I was in body
and soul But Fance will ha thee Dickshe wont walk with another
chapno such good luck

I dont know about that said Dick whipping at Smarts flank in a
fanciful way which as Smart knew meant nothing in connection with
going on Theres Pason Maybold toothats all against me

What about he Shes never been stuffing into thy innocent heart that
hes in hove with her Lord the vanity o maidens

No no But he called and she looked at him in such a way and at me
in such a wayquite different the ways wereand as I was coming off
there was he hanging up her birdcage

Well why shouldnt the man hang up her birdcage Turk seize it all
whats that got to do wi it Dick that thou beest a whitelyvered chap
I dont say but if thou beestnt as mad as a cappelfaced bull let me
smile no more

O ay

And whats think now Dick

I dont know

Heres another pretty kettle o fish for thee Who dye thinks the
bitter weed in our being turned out Did our party tell ee

No Why Pason Maybold I suppose

Shinerbecause hes in love with thy young woman and dwant to see
her young figure sitting up at that queer instrument and her young
fingers rumstrumming upon the keys

A sharp ado of sweet and bitter was going on in Dick during this
communication from his father Shiners a foolno thats not it I
dont believe any such thing father Why Shiner would never take a
bold step like that unless shed been a little made up to and had taken
it kindly Pooh

Whos to say she didnt

I do

The more fool you

Why father of me

Has she ever done more to thee

No

Then she has done as much to herot em Now Dick this is how a maid
is Shell swear shes dying for thee and she is dying for thee and
she will die for thee but shell fling a look over tother shoulder at
another young feller though never leaving off dying for thee just the
same

Shes not dying for me and so she didnt fling a look at him

But she may be dying for him for she looked at thee

I dont know what to make of it at all said Dick gloomily

All I can make of it is the tranter said raising his whip arranging
his different joints and muscles and motioning to the horse to move on
that if you cant read a maids mind by her motions nature dseem to
say thoust ought to be a bachelor Clk clk Smiler And the tranter
moved on

Dick held Smarts rein firmly and the whole concern of horse cart and
man remained rooted in the lane How long this condition would have
lasted is unknown had not Dicks thoughts after adding up numerous
items of misery gradually wandered round to the fact that as something
must be done it could not be done by staying there all night

Reaching home he went up to his bedroom shut the door as if he were
going to be seen no more in this life and taking a sheet of paper and
uncorking the inkbottle he began a letter The dignity of the writers
mind was so powerfully apparent in every line of this effusion that it
obscured the logical sequence of facts and intentions to an appreciable
degree and it was not at all clear to a reader whether he there and then
left off loving Miss Fancy Day whether he had never loved her seriously
and never meant to whether he had been dying up to the present moment
and now intended to get well again or whether he had hitherto been in
good health and intended to die for her forthwith

He put this letter in an envelope sealed it up directed it in a stern
handwriting of straight dasheseasy flourishes being rigorously
excluded He walked with it in his pocket down the lane in strides not
an inch less than three feet long Reaching her gate he put on a
resolute expressionthen put it off again turned back homeward tore up
his letter and sat down

That letter was altogether in a wrong tonethat he must own A
heartless manoftheworld tone was what the juncture required That he
rather wanted her and rather did not want herthe latter for choice
but that as a member of society he didnt mind making a query in jaunty
terms which could only be answered in the same way did she mean
anything by her bearing towards him or did she not

This letter was considered so satisfactory in every way that being put
into the hands of a little boy and the order given that he was to run
with it to the school he was told in addition not to look behind him if
Dick called after him to bring it back but to run along with it just the
same Having taken this precaution against vacillation Dick watched his
messenger down the road and turned into the house whistling an air in
such ghastly jerks and starts that whistling seemed to be the act the
very furthest removed from that which was instinctive in such a youth

The letter was left as ordered the next morning came and passedand no
answer The next The next Friday night came Dick resolved that if
no answer or sign were given by her the next day on Sunday he would meet
her face to face and have it all out by word of mouth

Dick said his father coming in from the garden at that momentin
each hand a hive of bees tied in a cloth to prevent their egressI
think youd better take these two swarms of bees to Mrs Maybolds to
morrow instead o me and Ill go wi Smiler and the wagon

It was a relief for Mrs Maybold the vicars mother who had just taken
into her head a fancy for keeping bees pleasantly disguised under the
pretence of its being an economical wish to produce her own honey lived
near the wateringplace of BudmouthRegis ten miles off and the
business of transporting the hives thither would occupy the whole day
and to some extent annihilate the vacant time between this evening and
the coming Sunday The best springcart was washed throughout the axles
oiled and the bees placed therein for the journey




PART THE THIRDSUMMER


CHAPTER I DRIVING OUT OF BUDMOUTH


An easy bend of neck and graceful set of head full and wavy bundles of
darkbrown hair light fall of little feet pretty devices on the skirt
of the dress clear deep eyes in short a bunch of sweets it was Fancy
Dicks heart went round to her with a rush

The scene was the corner of Mary Street in BudmouthRegis near the
Kings statue at which point the white angle of the last house in the
row cut perpendicularly an embayed and nearly motionless expanse of salt
water projected from the outer oceantoday lit in bright tones of green
and opal Dick and Smart had just emerged from the street and there on
the right against the brilliant sheet of liquid colour stood Fancy Day
and she turned and recognized him

Dick suspended his thoughts of the letter and wonder at how she came
there by driving close to the chains of the Esplanadeincontinently
displacing two chairmen who had just come to life for the summer in new
clean shirts and revivified clothes and being almost displaced in turn
by a rigid boy rattling along with a bakers cart and looking neither to
the right nor the left He asked if she were going to Mellstock that
night

Yes Im waiting for the carrier she replied seeming too to suspend
thoughts of the letter

Now I can drive you home nicely and you save half an hour Will ye
come with me

As Fancys power to will anything seemed to have departed in some
mysterious manner at that moment Dick settled the matter by getting out
and assisting her into the vehicle without another word

The temporary flush upon her cheek changed to a lesser hue which was
permanent and at length their eyes met there was present between them a
certain feeling of embarrassment which arises at such moments when all
the instinctive acts dictated by the position have been performed Dick
being engaged with the reins thought less of this awkwardness than did
Fancy who had nothing to do but to feel his presence and to be more and
more conscious of the fact that by accepting a seat beside him in this
way she succumbed to the tone of his note Smart jogged along and Dick
jogged and the helpless Fancy necessarily jogged too and she felt that
she was in a measure captured and made a prisoner

I am so much obliged to you for your company Miss Day he observed as
they drove past the two semicircular bays of the Old Royal Hotel where
His Majesty King George the Third had many a time attended the balls of
the burgesses

To Miss Day crediting him with the same consciousness of masterya
consciousness of which he was perfectly innocentthis remark sounded
like a magnanimous intention to soothe her the captive

I didnt come for the pleasure of obliging you with my company she
said

The answer had an unexpected manner of incivility in it that must have
been rather surprising to young Dewy At the same time it may be
observed that when a young woman returns a rude answer to a young mans
civil remark her heart is in a state which argues rather hopefully for
his case than otherwise

There was silence between them till they had left the seafront and
passed about twenty of the trees that ornamented the road leading up out
of the town towards Casterbridge and Mellstock

Though I didnt come for that purpose either I would have done it
said Dick at the twentyfirst tree

Now Mr Dewy no flirtation because its wrong and I dont wish it

Dick seated himself afresh just as he had been sitting before arranged
his looks very emphatically and cleared his throat

Really anybody would think you had met me on business and were just
going to commence said the lady intractably

Yes they would

Why you never have to be sure

This was a shaky beginning He chopped round and said cheerily as a
man who had resolved never to spoil his jollity by loving one of
womankind

Well how are you getting on Miss Day at the present time Gaily I
dont doubt for a moment

I am not gay Dick you know that

Gaily doesnt mean decked in gay dresses

I didnt suppose gaily was gaily dressed Mighty me what a scholar
youve grown

Lots of things have happened to you this spring I see

What have you seen

O nothing Ive heard I mean

What have you heard

The name of a pretty man with brass studs and a copper ring and a tin
watchchain a little mixed up with your own Thats all

Thats a very unkind picture of Mr Shiner for thats who you mean The
studs are gold as you know and its a real silver chain the ring I
cant conscientiously defend and he only wore it once

He might have worn it a hundred times without showing it half so much

Well hes nothing to me she serenely observed

Not any more than I am

Now Mr Dewy said Fancy severely certainly he isnt any more to me
than you are

Not so much

She looked aside to consider the precise compass of that question That
I cant exactly answer she replied with soft archness

As they were going rather slowly another springcart containing a
farmer farmers wife and farmers man jogged past them and the
farmers wife and farmers man eyed the couple very curiously The
farmer never looked up from the horses tail

Why cant you exactly answer said Dick quickening Smart a little and
jogging on just behind the farmer and farmers wife and man

As no answer came and as their eyes had nothing else to do they both
contemplated the picture presented in front and noticed how the farmers
wife sat flattened between the two men who bulged over each end of the
seat to give her room till they almost sat upon their respective wheels
and they looked too at the farmers wifes silk mantle inflating itself
between her shoulders like a balloon and sinking flat again at each jog
of the horse The farmers wife feeling their eyes sticking into her
back looked over her shoulder Dick dropped ten yards further behind

Fancy why cant you answer he repeated

Because how much you are to me depends upon how much I am to you said
she in low tones

Everything said Dick putting his hand towards hers and casting
emphatic eyes upon the upper curve of her cheek

Now Richard Dewy no touching me I didnt say in what way your
thinking of me affected the questionperhaps inversely dont you see
No touching sir Look goodness me dont Dick

The cause of her sudden start was the unpleasant appearance over Dicks
right shoulder of an empty timberwagon and four journeymencarpenters
reclining in lazy postures inside it their eyes directed upwards at
various oblique angles into the surrounding world the chief object of
their existence being apparently to criticize to the very backbone and
marrow every animate object that came within the compass of their vision
This difficulty of Dicks was overcome by trotting on till the wagon and
carpenters were beginning to look rather misty by reason of a film of
dust that accompanied their wagonwheels and rose around their heads
like a fog

Say you love me Fancy

No Dick certainly not tisnt time to do that yet

Why Fancy

Miss Day is better at presentdont mind my saying so and I ought
not to have called you Dick

Nonsense when you know that I would do anything on earth for your love
Why you make any one think that loving is a thing that can be done and
undone and put on and put off at a mere whim

No no I dont she said gently but there are things which tell me I
ought not to give way to much thinking about you even if

But you want to dont you Yes say you do it is best to be truthful
Whatever they may say about a womans right to conceal where her love
lies and pretend it doesnt exist and things like that it is not best
I do know it Fancy And an honest woman in that as well as in all her
daily concerns shines most brightly and is thought most of in the long
run

Well then perhaps Dick I do love you a little she whispered
tenderly but I wish you wouldnt say any more now

I wont say any more now then if you dont like it dear But you do
love me a little dont you

Now you ought not to want me to keep saying things twice I cant say
any more now and you must be content with what you have

I may at any rate call you Fancy Theres no harm in that

Yes you may

And youll not call me Mr Dewy any more

Very well



CHAPTER II FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD


Dicks spirits having risen in the course of these admissions of his
sweetheart he now touched Smart with the whip and on Smarts neck not
far behind his ears Smart who had been lost in thought for some time
never dreaming that Dick could reach so far with a whip which on this
particular journey had never been extended further than his flank
tossed his head and scampered along with exceeding briskness which was
very pleasant to the young couple behind him till turning a bend in the
road they came instantly upon the farmer farmers man and farmers
wife with the flapping mantle all jogging on just the same as ever

Bother those people Here we are upon them again

Well of course They have as much right to the road as we

Yes but it is provoking to be overlooked so I like a road all to
myself Look what a lumbering affair theirs is The wheels of the
farmers cart just at that moment jogged into a depression running
across the road giving the cart a twist whereupon all three nodded to
the left and on coming out of it all three nodded to the right and went
on jerking their backs in and out as usual Well pass them when the
road gets wider

When an opportunity seemed to offer itself for carrying this intention
into effect they heard light flying wheels behind and on their
quartering there whizzed along past them a brandnew gig so brightly
polished that the spokes of the wheels sent forth a continual quivering
light at one point in their circle and all the panels glared like
mirrors in Dick and Fancys eyes The driver and owner as it appeared
was really a handsome man his companion was Shiner Both turned round
as they passed Dick and Fancy and stared with bold admiration in her
face till they were obliged to attend to the operation of passing the
farmer Dick glanced for an instant at Fancy while she was undergoing
their scrutiny then returned to his driving with rather a sad
countenance

Why are you so silent she said after a while with real concern

Nothing

Yes it is Dick I couldnt help those people passing

I know that

You look offended with me What have I done

I cant tell without offending you

Better out

Well said Dick who seemed longing to tell even at the risk of
offending her I was thinking how different you in love are from me in
love Whilst those men were staring you dismissed me from your thoughts
altogether and

You cant offend me further now tell all

And showed upon your face a pleased sense of being attractive to em

Dont be silly Dick You know very well I didnt

Dick shook his head sceptically and smiled

Dick I always believe flattery if possibleand it was possible then
Now theres an open confession of weakness But I showed no
consciousness of it

Dick perceiving by her look that she would adhere to her statement
charitably forbore saying anything that could make her prevaricate The
sight of Shiner too had recalled another branch of the subject to his
mind that which had been his greatest trouble till her company and words
had obscured its probability

By the way Fancy do you know why our quire is to be dismissed

No except that it is Mr Maybolds wish for me to play the organ

Do you know how it came to be his wish

That I dont

Mr Shiner being churchwarden has persuaded the vicar who however
was willing enough before Shiner I know is crazy to see you playing
every Sunday I suppose hell turn over your music for the organ will be
close to his pew ButI know you have never encouraged him

Never once said Fancy emphatically and with eyes full of earnest
truth I dont like him indeed and I never heard of his doing this
before I have always felt that I should like to play in a church but I
never wished to turn you and your choir out and I never even said that I
could play till I was asked You dont think for a moment that I did
surely do you

I know you didnt dear

Or that I care the least morsel of a bit for him

I know you dont

The distance between Budmouth and Mellstock was ten or eleven miles and
there being a good inn The Ship four miles out of Budmouth with a
mast and crosstrees in front Dicks custom in driving thither was to
divide the journey into three stages by resting at this inn going and
coming and not troubling the Budmouth stables at all whenever his visit
to the town was a mere call and deposit as today

Fancy was ushered into a little tearoom and Dick went to the stables to
see to the feeding of Smart In face of the significant twitches of
feature that were visible in the ostler and labouring men idling around
Dick endeavoured to look unconscious of the fact that there was any
sentiment between him and Fancy beyond a tranters desire to carry a
passenger home He presently entered the inn and opened the door of
Fancys room

Dick do you know it has struck me that it is rather awkward my being
here alone with you like this I dont think you had better come in with
me

Thats rather unpleasant dear

Yes it is and I wanted you to have some tea as well as myself too
because you must be tired

Well let me have some with you then I was denied once before if you
recollect Fancy

Yes yes never mind And it seems unfriendly of me now but I dont
know what to do

It shall be as you say then Dick began to retreat with a
dissatisfied wrinkling of face and a farewell glance at the cosy tea
tray

But you dont see how it is Dick when you speak like that she said
with more earnestness than she had ever shown before You do know that
even if I care very much for you I must remember that I have a difficult
position to maintain The vicar would not like me as his
schoolmistress to indulge in a teteatete anywhere with anybody

But I am not any body exclaimed Dick

No no I mean with a young man and she added softly unless I were
really engaged to be married to him

Is that all Then dearest dearest why well be engaged at once to
be sure we will and down I sit There it is as easy as a glove

Ah but suppose I wont And goodness me what have I done she
faltered getting very red Positively it seems as if I meant you to
say that

Lets do it I mean get engaged said Dick Now Fancy will you be
my wife

Do you know Dick it was rather unkind of you to say what you did
coming along the road she remarked as if she had not heard the latter
part of his speech though an acute observer might have noticed about her
breast as the word wife fell from Dicks lips a soft silent escape of
breaths with very short rests between each

What did I say

About my trying to look attractive to those men in the gig

You couldnt help looking so whether you tried or no And Fancy you
do care for me

Yes

Very much

Yes

And youll be my own wife

Her heart quickened adding to and withdrawing from her cheek varying
tones of red to match each varying thought Dick looked expectantly at
the ripe tint of her delicate mouth waiting for what was coming forth

Yesif father will let me

Dick drew himself close to her compressing his lips and pouting them
out as if he were about to whistle the softest melody known

O no said Fancy solemnly

The modest Dick drew back a little

Dick Dick kiss me and let me go instantlyheres somebody coming
she whisperingly exclaimed

  

Half an hour afterwards Dick emerged from the inn and if Fancys lips
had been real cherries probably Dicks would have appeared deeply
stained The landlord was standing in the yard

Heuheu hayhay Master Dewy Hoho he laughed letting the laugh
slip out gently and by degrees that it might make little noise in its
exit and smiting Dick under the fifth rib at the same time This will
never do upon my life Master Dewy calling for tay for a feymel
passenger and then going in and sitting down and having some too and
biding such a fine long time

But surely you know said Dick with great apparent surprise Yes
yes Haha smiting the landlord under the ribs in return

Why what Yes yes haha

You know of course

Yes of course Butthat isI dont

Why aboutbetween that young lady and me nodding to the window of the
room that Fancy occupied

No not I said the innkeeper bringing his eyes into circles

And you dont

Not a word Ill take my oath

But you laughed when I laughed

Ay that was me sympathy so did you when I laughed

Really you dont know Goodnessnot knowing that

Ill take my oath I dont

O yes said Dick with frigid rhetoric of pitying astonishment were
engaged to be married you see and I naturally look after her

Of course of course I didnt know that and I hope yell excuse any
little freedom of mine Mr Dewy But it is a very odd thing I was
talking to your father very intimate about family matters only last
Friday in the world and who should come in but Keeper Day and we all
then fell atalking o family matters but neither one o them said a
mortal word about it knowen me too so many years and I at your fathers
own wedding Tisnt what I should have expected from an old neighbour

Well to say the truth we hadnt told father of the engagement at that
time in fact twasnt settled

Ah the business was done Sunday Yes yes Sundays the courting day
Heuheu

No twasnt done Sunday in particular

After schoolhours this week Well a very good time a very proper
good time

O no twasnt done then

Coming along the road today then I suppose

Not at all I wouldnt think of getting engaged in a dogcart

Dammymight as well have said at once the when be blowed Anyhow
tis a fine day and I hope next time youll come as one

Fancy was duly brought out and assisted into the vehicle and the newly
affianced youth and maiden passed up the steep hill to the Ridgeway and
vanished in the direction of Mellstock



CHAPTER III A CONFESSION


It was a morning of the latter summertime a morning of lingering dews
when the grass is never dry in the shade Fuchsias and dahlias were
laden till eleven oclock with small drops and dashes of water changing
the colour of their sparkle at every movement of the air and elsewhere
hanging on twigs like small silver fruit The threads of garden spiders
appeared thick and polished In the dry and sunny places dozens of long
legged craneflies whizzed off the grass at every step the passer took

Fancy Day and her friend Susan Dewy the tranters daughter were in such
a spot as this pulling down a bough laden with early apples Three
months had elapsed since Dick and Fancy had journeyed together from
Budmouth and the course of their love had run on vigorously during the
whole time There had been just enough difficulty attending its
development and just enough finesse required in keeping it private to
lend the passion an everincreasing freshness on Fancys part whilst
whether from these accessories or not Dicks heart had been at all times
as fond as could be desired But there was a cloud on Fancys horizon
now

She is so well offbetter than any of us Susan Dewy was saying Her
father farms five hundred acres and she might marry a doctor or curate
or anything of that kind if she contrived a little

I dont think Dick ought to have gone to that gipsyparty at all when he
knew I couldnt go replied Fancy uneasily

He didnt know that you would not be there till it was too late to
refuse the invitation said Susan

And what was she like Tell me

Well she was rather pretty I must own

Tell straight on about her cant you Come do Susan How many times
did you say he danced with her

Once

Twice I think you said

Indeed Im sure I didnt

Well and he wanted to again I expect

No I dont think he did She wanted to dance with him again bad
enough I know Everybody does with Dick because hes so handsome and
such a clever courter

O I wishHow did you say she wore her hair

In long curlsand her hair is light and it curls without being put in
paper thats how it is shes so attractive

Shes trying to get him away yes yes she is And through keeping
this miserable school I mustnt wear my hair in curls But I will I
dont care if I leave the school and go home I will wear my curls Look
Susan do is her hair as soft and long as this Fancy pulled from its
coil under her hat a twine of her own hair and stretched it down her
shoulder to show its length looking at Susan to catch her opinion from
her eyes

It is about the same length as that I think said Miss Dewy

Fancy paused hopelessly I wish mine was lighter like hers she
continued mournfully But hers isnt so soft is it Tell me now

I dont know

Fancy abstractedly extended her vision to survey a yellow butterfly and a
redandblack butterfly that were flitting along in company and then
became aware that Dick was advancing up the garden

Susan heres Dick coming I suppose thats because weve been talking
about him

Well then I shall go indoors nowyou wont want me and Susan turned
practically and walked off

Enter the singleminded Dick whose only fault at the gipsying or
picnic had been that of loving Fancy too exclusively and depriving
himself of the innocent pleasure the gathering might have afforded him
by sighing regretfully at her absencewho had danced with the rival in
sheer despair of ever being able to get through that stale flat and
unprofitable afternoon in any other way but this she would not believe

Fancy had settled her plan of emotion To reproach Dick O no no I
am in great trouble said she taking what was intended to be a
hopelessly melancholy survey of a few small apples lying under the tree
yet a critical ear might have noticed in her voice a tentative tone as to
the effect of the words upon Dick when she uttered them

What are you in trouble about Tell me of it said Dick earnestly
Darling I will share it with ee and help ee

No no you cant Nobody can

Why not You dont deserve it whatever it is Tell me dear

O it isnt what you think It is dreadful my own sin

Sin Fancy as if you could sin I know it cant be

Tis tis said the young lady in a pretty little frenzy of sorrow
I have done wrong and I dont like to tell it Nobody will forgive me
nobody and you above all will not    I have allowed myself
totofl

Whatnot flirt he said controlling his emotion as it were by a
sudden pressure inward from his surface And you said only the day
before yesterday that you hadnt flirted in your life

Yes I did and that was a wicked story I have let another love me
and

Good G Well Ill forgive youyes if you couldnt help ityes
I will said the now dismal Dick Did you encourage him

OI dont knowyesno O I think so

Who was it A pause Tell me

Mr Shiner

After a silence that was only disturbed by the fall of an apple a long
checked sigh from Dick and a sob from Fancy he said with real
austerity

Tell it allevery word

He looked at me and I looked at him and he said Will you let me show
you how to catch bullfinches down here by the stream And Iwanted to
know very muchI did so long to have a bullfinch I couldnt help that
and I said Yes and then he said Come here And I went with him
down to the lovely river and then he said to me Look and see how I do
it and then youll know I put this birdlime round this twig and then I
go here he said and hide away under a bush and presently clever
Mister Bird comes and perches upon the twig and flaps his wings and
youve got him before you can say Jacksomething O O O I forget
what

Jack Sprat mournfully suggested Dick through the cloud of his misery

No not Jack Sprat she sobbed

Then twas Jack Robinson he said with the emphasis of a man who had
resolved to discover every iota of the truth or die

Yes that was it And then I put my hand upon the rail of the bridge to
get across andThats all

Well that isnt much either said Dick critically and more
cheerfully Not that I see what business Shiner has to take upon
himself to teach you anything But it seemsit do seem there must have
been more than that to set you up in such a dreadful taking

He looked into Fancys eyes Misery of miseriesguilt was written
there still

Now Fancy youve not told me all said Dick rather sternly for a
quiet young man

O dont speak so cruelly I am afraid to tell now If you hadnt been
harsh I was going on to tell all now I cant

Come dear Fancy tell come Ill forgive I mustby heaven and
earth I must whether I will or no I love you so

Well when I put my hand on the bridge he touched it

A scamp said Dick grinding an imaginary human frame to powder

And then he looked at me and at last he said Are you in love with
Dick Dewy And I said Perhaps I am and then he said I wish you
werent then for I want to marry you with all my soul

Theres a villain now Want to marry you And Dick quivered with the
bitterness of satirical laughter Then suddenly remembering that he
might be reckoning without his host Unless to be sure you are willing
to have himperhaps you are he said with the wretched indifference
of a castaway

No indeed I am not she said her sobs just beginning to take a
favourable turn towards cure

Well then said Dick coming a little to his senses youve been
stretching it very much in giving such a dreadful beginning to such a
mere nothing And I know what youve done it forjust because of that
gipsyparty He turned away from her and took five paces decisively as
if he were tired of an ungrateful country including herself You did
it to make me jealous and I wont stand it He flung the words to her
over his shoulder and then stalked on apparently very anxious to walk to
the remotest of the Colonies that very minute

O O O DickDick she cried trotting after him like a pet lamb and
really seriously alarmed at last youll kill me My impulses are
badmiserably wickedand I cant help it forgive me Dick And I
love you always and those times when you look silly and dont seem quite
good enough for mejust the same I do Dick And there is something
more serious though not concerning that walk with him

Well what is it said Dick altering his mind about walking to the
Colonies in fact passing to the other extreme and standing so rooted
to the road that he was apparently not even going home

Why this she said drying the beginning of a new flood of tears she
had been going to shed this is the serious part Father has told Mr
Shiner that he would like him for a soninlaw if he could get methat
he has his right hearty consent to come courting me



CHAPTER IV AN ARRANGEMENT


That is serious said Dick more intellectually than he had spoken for
a long time

The truth was that Geoffrey knew nothing about his daughters continued
walks and meetings with Dick When a hint that there were symptoms of an
attachment between them had first reached Geoffreys ears he stated so
emphatically that he must think the matter over before any such thing
could be allowed that rather unwisely on Dicks part whatever it might
have been on the ladys the lovers were careful to be seen together no
more in public and Geoffrey forgetting the report did not think over
the matter at all So Mr Shiner resumed his old position in Geoffreys
brain by mere flux of time Even Shiner began to believe that Dick
existed for Fancy no morethough that remarkably easygoing man had
taken no active steps on his own account as yet

And father has not only told Mr Shiner that continued Fancy but he
has written me a letter to say he should wish me to encourage Mr
Shiner if twas convenient

I must start off and see your father at once said Dick taking two or
three vehement steps to the south recollecting that Mr Day lived to the
north and coming back again

I think we had better see him together Not tell him what you come for
or anything of the kind until he likes you and so win his brain through
his heart which is always the way to manage people I mean in this way
I am going home on Saturday week to help them in the honeytaking You
might come there to me have something to eat and drink and let him
guess what your coming signifies without saying it in so many words

Well do it dearest But I shall ask him for you flat and plain not
wait for his guessing And the lover then stepped close to her and
attempted to give her one little kiss on the cheek his lips alighting
however on an outlying tract of her back hair by reason of an impulse
that had caused her to turn her head with a jerk Yes and Ill put on
my secondbest suit and a clean shirt and collar and black my boots as
if twas a Sunday Twill have a good appearance you see and thats a
great deal to start with

You wont wear that old waistcoat will you Dick

Bless you no Why I

I didnt mean to be personal dear Dick she said fearing she had hurt
his feelings Tis a very nice waistcoat but what I meant was that
though it is an excellent waistcoat for a settleddown man it is not
quite one for she waited and a blush expanded over her face and then
she went on againfor going courting in

No Ill wear my best winter one with the leather lining that mother
made It is a beautiful handsome waistcoat inside yes as ever anybody
saw In fact only the other day I unbuttoned it to show a chap that
very lining and he said it was the strongest handsomest lining you
could wish to see on the kings waistcoat himself

I dont quite know what to wear she said as if her habitual
indifference alone to dress had kept back so important a subject till
now

Why that blue frock you wore last week

Doesnt set well round the neck I couldnt wear that

But I shant care

No you wont mind

Well then its all right Because you only care how you look to me do
you dear I only dress for you thats certain

Yes but you see I couldnt appear in it again very well

Any strange gentleman you mid meet in your journey might notice the set
of it I suppose Fancy men in love dont think so much about how they
look to other women It is difficult to say whether a tone of playful
banter or of gentle reproach prevailed in the speech

Well then Dick she said with goodhumoured frankness Ill own it
I shouldnt like a stranger to see me dressed badly even though I am in
love Tis our nature I suppose

You perfect woman

Yes if you lay the stress on woman she murmured looking at a group
of hollyhocks in flower round which a crowd of butterflies had gathered
like female idlers round a bonnetshop

But about the dress Why not wear the one you wore at our party

That sets well but a girl of the name of Bet Tallor who lives near our
house has had one made almost like it only in pattern though of
miserably cheap stuff and I couldnt wear it on that account Dear me
I am afraid I cant go now

O yes you must I know you will said Dick with dismay Why not
wear what youve got on

What this old one After all I think that by wearing my gray one
Saturday I can make the blue one do for Sunday Yes I will A hat or
a bonnet which shall it be Which do I look best in

Well I think the bonnet is nicest more quiet and matronly

Whats the objection to the hat Does it make me look old

O no the hat is well enough but it makes you look rather tooyou
wont mind me saying it dear

Not at all for I shall wear the bonnet

Rather too coquettish and flirty for an engaged young woman

She reflected a minute Yes yes Still after all the hat would do
best hats are best you see Yes I must wear the hat dear Dicky
because I ought to wear a hat you know




PART THE FOURTHAUTUMN


CHAPTER I GOING NUTTING


Dick dressed in his secondbest suit burst into Fancys sittingroom
with a glow of pleasure on his face

It was two oclock on Friday the day before her contemplated visit to
her father and for some reason connected with cleaning the school the
children had been given this Friday afternoon for pastime in addition to
the usual Saturday

Fancy it happens just right that it is a leisure half day with you
Smart is lame in his nearfootafore and so as I cant do anything
Ive made a holiday afternoon of it and am come for you to go nutting
with me

She was sitting by the parlour window with a blue frock lying across her
lap and scissors in her hand

Go nutting Yes But Im afraid I cant go for an hour or so

Why not Tis the only spare afternoon we may both have together for
weeks

This dress of mine that I am going to wear on Sunday at YalburyI
find it fits so badly that I must alter it a little after all I told
the dressmaker to make it by a pattern I gave her at the time instead of
that she did it her own way and made me look a perfect fright

How long will you be he inquired looking rather disappointed

Not long Do wait and talk to me come do dear

Dick sat down The talking progressed very favourably amid the snipping
and sewing till about halfpast two at which time his conversation
began to be varied by a slight tapping upon his toe with a walkingstick
he had cut from the hedge as he came along Fancy talked and answered
him but sometimes the answers were so negligently given that it was
evident her thoughts lay for the greater part in her lap with the blue
dress

The clock struck three Dick arose from his seat walked round the room
with his hands behind him examined all the furniture then sounded a few
notes on the harmonium then looked inside all the books he could find
then smoothed Fancys head with his hand Still the snipping and sewing
went on

The clock struck four Dick fidgeted about yawned privately counted
the knots in the table yawned publicly counted the flies on the
ceiling yawned horribly went into the kitchen and scullery and so
thoroughly studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that
he could have delivered a lecture on the subject Stepping back to
Fancy and finding still that she had not done he went into her garden
and looked at her cabbages and potatoes and reminded himself that they
seemed to him to wear a decidedly feminine aspect then pulled up several
weeds and came in again The clock struck five and still the snipping
and sewing went on

Dick attempted to kill a fly peeled all the rind off his walkingstick
then threw the stick into the scullery because it was spoilt produced
hideous discords from the harmonium and accidentally overturned a vase
of flowers the water from which ran in a rill across the table and
dribbled to the floor where it formed a lake the shape of which after
the lapse of a few minutes he began to modify considerably with his
foot till it was like a map of England and Wales

Well Dick you neednt have made quite such a mess

Well I neednt I suppose He walked up to the blue dress and looked
at it with a rigid gaze Then an idea seemed to cross his brain

Fancy

Yes

I thought you said you were going to wear your gray gown all day
tomorrow on your trip to Yalbury and in the evening too when I shall
be with you and ask your father for you

So I am

And the blue one only on Sunday

And the blue one Sunday

Well dear I shant be at Yalbury Sunday to see it

No but I shall walk to Longpuddle church in the afternoon with father
and such lots of people will be looking at me there you know and it did
set so badly round the neck

I never noticed it and tis like nobody else would

They might

Then why not wear the gray one on Sunday as well Tis as pretty as the
blue one

I might make the gray one do certainly But it isnt so good it
didnt cost half so much as this one and besides it would be the same I
wore Saturday

Then wear the striped one dear

I might

Or the dark one

Yes I might but I want to wear a fresh one they havent seen

I see I see said Dick in a voice in which the tones of love were
decidedly inconvenienced by a considerable emphasis his thoughts
meanwhile running as follows I the man she loves best in the world as
she says am to understand that my poor halfholiday is to be lost
because she wants to wear on Sunday a gown there is not the slightest
necessity for wearing simply in fact to appear more striking than
usual in the eyes of Longpuddle young men and I not there either

Then there are three dresses good enough for my eyes but neither is
good enough for the youths of Longpuddle he said

No not that exactly Dick Still you see I do wantto look pretty
to themthere thats honest But I shant be much longer

How much

A quarter of an hour

Very well Ill come in in a quarter of an hour

Why go away

I mid as well

He went out walked down the road and sat upon a gate Here he
meditated and meditated and the more he meditated the more decidedly did
he begin to fume and the more positive was he that his time had been
scandalously trifled with by Miss Fancy Daythat so far from being the
simple girl who had never had a sweetheart before as she had solemnly
assured him time after time she was if not a flirt a woman who had had
no end of admirers a girl most certainly too anxious about her frocks a
girl whose feelings though warm were not deep a girl who cared a
great deal too much how she appeared in the eyes of other men What she
loves best in the world he thought with an incipient spice of his
fathers grimness is her hair and complexion What she loves next
best her gowns and hats what she loves next best myself perhaps

Suffering great anguish at this disloyalty in himself and harshness to
his darling yet disposed to persevere in it a horribly cruel thought
crossed his mind He would not call for her as he had promised at the
end of a quarter of an hour Yes it would be a punishment she well
deserved Although the best part of the afternoon had been wasted he
would go nutting as he had intended and go by himself

He leaped over the gate and pushed up the lane for nearly two miles
till a winding path called SnailCreep sloped up a hill and entered a
hazel copse by a hole like a rabbits burrow In he plunged vanished
among the bushes and in a short time there was no sign of his existence
upon earth save an occasional rustling of boughs and snapping of twigs
in divers points of Greys Wood

Never man nutted as Dick nutted that afternoon He worked like a galley
slave Halfhour after halfhour passed away and still he gathered
without ceasing At last when the sun had set and bunches of nuts
could not be distinguished from the leaves which nourished them he
shouldered his bag containing quite two pecks of the finest produce of
the wood about as much use to him as two pecks of stones from the road
strolled down the woodland track crossed the highway and entered the
homeward lane whistling as he went

Probably Miss Fancy Day never before or after stood so low in Mr Dewys
opinion as on that afternoon In fact it is just possible that a few
more blue dresses on the Longpuddle young mens account would have
clarified Dicks brain entirely and made him once more a free man

But Venus had planned other developments at any rate for the present
CuckooLane the way he pursued passed over a ridge which rose keenly
against the sky about fifty yards in his van Here upon the bright
afterglow about the horizon was now visible an irregular shape which
at first he conceived to be a bough standing a little beyond the line of
its neighbours Then it seemed to move and as he advanced still
further there was no doubt that it was a living being sitting in the
bank head bowed on hand The grassy margin entirely prevented his
footsteps from being heard and it was not till he was close that the
figure recognized him Up it sprang and he was face to face with Fancy

Dick Dick O is it you Dick

Yes Fancy said Dick in a rather repentant tone and lowering his
nuts

She ran up to him flung her parasol on the grass put her little head
against his breast and then there began a narrative disjointed by such
a hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for intensity in the whole
history of love

O Dick she sobbed out where have you been away from me O I have
suffered agony and thought you would never come any more Tis cruel
Dick no tisnt it is justice Ive been walking miles and miles up
and down Greys Wood trying to find you till I was wearied and worn
out and I could walk no further and had come back this far O Dick
directly you were gone I thought I had offended you and I put down the
dress tisnt finished now and I never will finish it and Ill wear
an old one Sunday Yes Dick I will because I dont care what I wear
when you are not by my sideha you think I do but I dontand I ran
after you and I saw you go up SnailCreep and not look back once and
then you plunged in and I after you but I was too far behind O I did
wish the horrid bushes had been cut down so that I could see your dear
shape again And then I called out to you and nobody answered and I
was afraid to call very loud lest anybody else should hear me Then I
kept wandering and wandering about and it was dreadful misery Dick And
then I shut my eyes and fell to picturing you looking at some other
woman very pretty and nice but with no affection or truth in her at
all and then imagined you saying to yourself Ah shes as good as
Fancy for Fancy told me a story and was a flirt and cared for herself
more than me so now Ill have this one for my sweetheart O you
wont will you Dick for I do love you so

It is scarcely necessary to add that Dick renounced his freedom there and
then and kissed her ten times over and promised that no pretty woman of
the kind alluded to should ever engross his thoughts in short that
though he had been vexed with her all such vexation was past and that
henceforth and for ever it was simply Fancy or death for him And then
they set about proceeding homewards very slowly on account of Fancys
weariness she leaning upon his shoulder and in addition receiving
support from his arm round her waist though she had sufficiently
recovered from her desperate condition to sing to him Why are you
wandering here I pray during the latter part of their walk Nor is it
necessary to describe in detail how the bag of nuts was quite forgotten
until three days later when it was found among the brambles and restored
empty to Mrs Dewy her initials being marked thereon in red cotton and
how she puzzled herself till her head ached upon the question of how on
earth her mealbag could have got into CuckooLane



CHAPTER II HONEYTAKING AND AFTERWARDS


Saturday evening saw Dick Dewy journeying on foot to Yalbury Wood
according to the arrangement with Fancy

The landscape being concave at the going down of the sun everything
suddenly assumed a uniform robe of shade The evening advanced from
sunset to dusk long before Dicks arrival and his progress during the
latter portion of his walk through the trees was indicated by the flutter
of terrified birds that had been roosting over the path And in crossing
the glades masses of hot dry air that had been formed on the hills
during the day greeted his cheeks alternately with clouds of damp night
air from the valleys He reached the keeperstewards house where the
grassplot and the garden in front appeared light and pale against the
unbroken darkness of the grove from which he had emerged and paused at
the garden gate

He had scarcely been there a minute when he beheld a sort of procession
advancing from the door in his front It consisted first of Enoch the
trapper carrying a spade on his shoulder and a lantern dangling in his
hand then came Mrs Day the light of the lantern revealing that she
bore in her arms curious objects about a foot long in the form of Latin
crosses made of lath and brown paper dipped in brimstonecalled matches
by beemasters next came Miss Day with a shawl thrown over her head
and behind all in the gloom Mr Frederic Shiner

Dick in his consternation at finding Shiner present was at a loss how
to proceed and retired under a tree to collect his thoughts

Here I be Enoch said a voice and the procession advancing farther
the lanterns rays illuminated the figure of Geoffrey awaiting their
arrival beside a row of beehives in front of the path Taking the
spade from Enoch he proceeded to dig two holes in the earth beside the
hives the others standing round in a circle except Mrs Day who
deposited her matches in the fork of an appletree and returned to the
house The party remaining were now lit up in front by the lantern in
their midst their shadows radiating each way upon the gardenplot like
the spokes of a wheel An apparent embarrassment of Fancy at the
presence of Shiner caused a silence in the assembly during which the
preliminaries of execution were arranged the matches fixed the stake
kindled the two hives placed over the two holes and the earth stopped
round the edges Geoffrey then stood erect and rather more to
straighten his backbone after the digging

They were a peculiar family said Mr Shiner regarding the hives
reflectively

Geoffrey nodded

Those holes will be the grave of thousands said Fancy I think tis
rather a cruel thing to do

Her father shook his head No he said tapping the hives to shake the
dead bees from their cells if you suffocate em this way they only die
once if you fumigate em in the new way they come to life again and
die o starvation so the pangs o death be twice upon em

I incline to Fancys notion said Mr Shiner laughing lightly

The proper way to take honey so that the bees be neither starved nor
murdered is a puzzling matter said the keeper steadily

I should like never to take it from them said Fancy

But tis the money said Enoch musingly For without money man is a
shadder

The lanternlight had disturbed many bees that had escaped from hives
destroyed some days earlier and demoralized by affliction were now
getting a living as marauders about the doors of other hives Several
flew round the head and neck of Geoffrey then darted upon him with an
irritated bizz

Enoch threw down the lantern and ran off and pushed his head into a
currant bush Fancy scudded up the path and Mr Shiner floundered away
helterskelter among the cabbages Geoffrey stood his ground unmoved
and firm as a rock Fancy was the first to return followed by Enoch
picking up the lantern Mr Shiner still remained invisible

Have the craters stung ye said Enoch to Geoffrey

No not muchony a little here and there he said with leisurely
solemnity shaking one bee out of his shirt sleeve pulling another from
among his hair and two or three more from his neck The rest looked on
during this proceeding with a complacent sense of being out of itmuch
as a European nation in a state of internal commotion is watched by its
neighbours

Are those all of them father said Fancy when Geoffrey had pulled
away five

Almost allthough I feel one or two more sticking into my shoulder and
side Ah theres another just begun again upon my backbone You lively
young mortals how did you get inside there However they cant sting
me many times more poor things for they must be getting weak They mid
as well stay in me till bedtime now I suppose

As he himself was the only person affected by this arrangement it seemed
satisfactory enough and after a noise of feet kicking against cabbages
in a blundering progress among them the voice of Mr Shiner was heard
from the darkness in that direction

Is all quite safe again

No answer being returned to this query he apparently assumed that he
might venture forth and gradually drew near the lantern again The
hives were now removed from their position over the holes one being
handed to Enoch to carry indoors and one being taken by Geoffrey
himself

Bring hither the lantern Fancy the spade can bide

Geoffrey and Enoch then went towards the house leaving Shiner and Fancy
standing side by side on the gardenplot

Allow me said Shiner stooping for the lantern and seizing it at the
same time with Fancy

I can carry it said Fancy religiously repressing all inclination to
trifle She had thoroughly considered that subject after the tearful
explanation of the birdcatching adventure to Dick and had decided that
it would be dishonest in her as an engaged young woman to trifle with
mens eyes and hands any more Finding that Shiner still retained his
hold of the lantern she relinquished it and he having found her
retaining it also let go The lantern fell and was extinguished Fancy
moved on

Where is the path said Mr Shiner

Here said Fancy Your eyes will get used to the dark in a minute or
two

Till that time will ye lend me your hand Fancy gave him the extreme
tips of her fingers and they stepped from the plot into the path

You dont accept attentions very freely

It depends upon who offers them

A fellow like me for instance A dead silence

Well what do you say Missie

It then depends upon how they are offered

Not wildly and yet not carelesslike not purposely and yet not by
chance not too quick nor yet too slow

How then said Fancy

Coolly and practically he said How would that kind of love be
taken

Not anxiously and yet not indifferently neither blushing nor pale nor
religiously nor yet quite wickedly

Well how

Not at all

    

Geoffrey Days storehouse at the back of his dwelling was hung with
bunches of dried horehound mint and sage brownpaper bags of thyme and
lavender and long ropes of clean onions On shelves were spread large
red and yellow apples and choice selections of early potatoes for seed
next yearvulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps A few
empty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner under which
stood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop each bubbling
and squirting forth from the yet open bunghole

Fancy was now kneeling beside the two inverted hives one of which rested
against her lap for convenience in operating upon the contents She
thrust her sleeves above her elbows and inserted her small pink hand
edgewise between each white lobe of honeycomb performing the act so
adroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell Then cracking the
piece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward
movement she lifted each portion as it was loosened into a large blue
platter placed on a bench at her side

Bother these little mortals said Geoffrey who was holding the light
to her and giving his back an uneasy twist I really think I may as
well go indoors and take em out poor things for they wont let me
alone Theres two a stinging wi all their might now Im sure I
wonder their strength can last so long

All right friend Ill hold the candle whilst you are gone said Mr
Shiner leisurely taking the light and allowing Geoffrey to depart
which he did with his usual long paces

He could hardly have gone round to the housedoor when other footsteps
were heard approaching the outbuilding the tip of a finger appeared in
the hole through which the wood latch was lifted and Dick Dewy came in
having been all this time walking up and down the wood vainly waiting
for Shiners departure

Fancy looked up and welcomed him rather confusedly Shiner grasped the
candlestick more firmly and lest doing this in silence should not imply
to Dick with sufficient force that he was quite at home and cool he sang
invincibly

 King Arthur he had three sons

Father here said Dick

Indoors I think said Fancy looking pleasantly at him

Dick surveyed the scene and did not seem inclined to hurry off just at
that moment Shiner went on singing

 The miller was drownd in his pond
 The weaver was hung in his yarn
 And the d ran away with the little tailor
 With the broadcloth under his arm

Thats a terrible crippled rhyme if thats your rhyme said Dick with
a grain of superciliousness in his tone

Its no use your complaining to me about the rhyme said Mr Shiner
You must go to the man that made it

Fancy by this time had acquired confidence

Taste a bit Mr Dewy she said holding up to him a small circular
piece of honeycomb that had been the last in the row of layers remaining
still on her knees and flinging back her head to look in his face and
then Ill taste a bit too

And I if you please said Mr Shiner Nevertheless the farmer looked
superior as if he could even now hardly join the trifling from very
importance of station and after receiving the honeycomb from Fancy he
turned it over in his hand till the cells began to be crushed and the
liquid honey ran down from his fingers in a thin string

Suddenly a faint cry from Fancy caused them to gaze at her

Whats the matter dear said Dick

It is nothing but Oo a bee has stung the inside of my lip He was in
one of the cells I was eating

We must keep down the swelling or it may be serious said Shiner
stepping up and kneeling beside her Let me see it

No no

Just let me see it said Dick kneeling on the other side and after
some hesitation she pressed down her lip with one finger to show the
place O I hope twill soon be better I dont mind a sting in
ordinary places but it is so bad upon your lip she added with tears in
her eyes and writhing a little from the pain

Shiner held the light above his head and pushed his face close to
Fancys as if the lip had been shown exclusively to himself upon which
Dick pushed closer as if Shiner were not there at all

It is swelling said Dick to her right aspect

It isnt swelling said Shiner to her left aspect

Is it dangerous on the lip cried Fancy I know it is dangerous on
the tongue

O no not dangerous answered Dick

Rather dangerous had answered Shiner simultaneously

I must try to bear it said Fancy turning again to the hives

Hartshornandoil is a good thing to put to it Miss Day said Shiner
with great concern

Sweetoilandhartshorn Ive found to be a good thing to cure stings
Miss Day said Dick with greater concern

We have some mixed indoors would you kindly run and get it for me she
said

Now whether by inadvertence or whether by mischievous intention the
individuality of the you was so carelessly denoted that both Dick and
Shiner sprang to their feet like twin acrobats and marched abreast to
the door both seized the latch and lifted it and continued marching on
shoulder to shoulder in the same manner to the dwellinghouse Not only
so but entering the room they marched as before straight up to Mrs
Days chair letting the door in the oak partition slam so forcibly that
the rows of pewter on the dresser rang like a bell

Mrs Day Fancy has stung her lip and wants you to give me the
hartshorn please said Mr Shiner very close to Mrs Days face

O Mrs Day Fancy has asked me to bring out the hartshorn please
because she has stung her lip said Dick a little closer to Mrs Days
face

Well men alive thats no reason why you should eat me I suppose
said Mrs Day drawing back

She searched in the cornercupboard produced the bottle and began to
dust the cork the rim and every other part very carefully Dicks hand
and Shiners hand waiting side by side

Which is head man said Mrs Day Now dont come mumbudgeting so
close again Which is head man

Neither spoke and the bottle was inclined towards Shiner Shiner as a
highclass man would not look in the least triumphant and turned to go
off with it as Geoffrey came downstairs after the search in his linen for
concealed bees

Othat you Master Dewy

Dick assured the keeper that it was and the young man then determined
upon a bold stroke for the attainment of his end forgetting that the
worst of bold strokes is the disastrous consequences they involve if they
fail

Ive come on purpose to speak to you very particular Mr Day he said
with a crushing emphasis intended for the ears of Mr Shiner who was
vanishing round the doorpost at that moment

Well Ive been forced to go upstairs and unrind myself and shake some
bees out o me said Geoffrey walking slowly towards the open door and
standing on the threshold The young rascals got into my shirt and
wouldnt be quiet nohow

Dick followed him to the door

Ive come to speak a word to you he repeated looking out at the pale
mist creeping up from the gloom of the valley You may perhaps guess
what it is about

The keeper lowered his hands into the depths of his pockets twirled his
eyes balanced himself on his toes looked as perpendicularly downward as
if his glance were a plumbline then horizontally collecting together
the cracks that lay about his face till they were all in the
neighbourhood of his eyes

Maybe I dont know he replied

Dick said nothing and the stillness was disturbed only by some small
bird that was being killed by an owl in the adjoining wood whose cry
passed into the silence without mingling with it

Ive left my hat up in chammer said Geoffrey wait while I step up
and get en

Ill be in the garden said Dick

He went round by a side wicket into the garden and Geoffrey went
upstairs It was the custom in Mellstock and its vicinity to discuss
matters of pleasure and ordinary business inside the house and to
reserve the garden for very important affairs a custom which as is
supposed originated in the desirability of getting away at such times
from the other members of the family when there was only one room for
living in though it was now quite as frequently practised by those who
suffered from no such limitation to the size of their domiciles

The headkeepers form appeared in the dusky garden and Dick walked
towards him The elder paused and leant over the rail of a piggery that
stood on the left of the path upon which Dick did the same and they
both contemplated a whitish shadowy shape that was moving about and
grunting among the straw of the interior

Ive come to ask for Fancy said Dick

Id as lief you hadnt

Why should that be Mr Day

Because it makes me say that youve come to ask what ye bent likely to
have Have ye come for anything else

Nothing

Then Ill just tell ee youve come on a very foolish errand Dye know
what her mother was

No

A teacher in a landed familys nursery who was foolish enough to marry
the keeper of the same establishment for I was only a keeper then
though now Ive a dozen other irons in the fire as steward here for my
lord what with the timber sales and the yearly fellings and the gravel
and sand sales and one thing and tother However dye think Fancy
picked up her good manners the smooth turn of her tongue her musical
notes and her knowledge of books in a homely hole like this

No

Dye know where

No

Well when I went awandering after her mothers death she lived with
her aunt who kept a boardingschool till her aunt married Lawyer
Greena man as sharp as a needleand the school was broke up Did ye
know that then she went to the trainingschool and that her name stood
first among the Queens scholars of her year

Ive heard so

And that when she sat for her certificate as Government teacher she had
the highest of the first class

Yes

Well and do ye know what I live in such a miserly way for when Ive got
enough to do without it and why I make her work as a schoolmistress
instead of living here

No

That if any gentleman who sees her to be his equal in polish should
want to marry her and she want to marry him he shant be superior to
her in pocket Now do ye think after this that you be good enough for
her

No

Then goodnight tee Master Dewy

Goodnight Mr Day

Modest Dicks reply had faltered upon his tongue and he turned away
wondering at his presumption in asking for a woman whom he had seen from
the beginning to be so superior to him



CHAPTER III FANCY IN THE RAIN


The next scene is a tempestuous afternoon in the following month and
Fancy Day is discovered walking from her fathers home towards Mellstock

A single vast gray cloud covered the country from which the small rain
and mist had just begun to blow down in wavy sheets alternately thick
and thin The trees of the fields and plantations writhed like miserable
men as the air wound its way swiftly among them the lowest portions of
their trunks that had hardly ever been known to move were visibly
rocked by the fiercer gusts distressing the mind by its painful
unwontedness as when a strong man is seen to shed tears Lowhanging
boughs went up and down high and erect boughs went to and fro the
blasts being so irregular and divided into so many crosscurrents that
neighbouring branches of the same tree swept the skies in independent
motions crossed each other or became entangled Across the open spaces
flew flocks of green and yellowish leaves which after travelling a long
distance from their parent trees reached the ground and lay there with
their undersides upward

As the rain and wind increased and Fancys bonnetribbons leapt more and
more snappishly against her chin she paused on entering Mellstock Lane
to consider her latitude and the distance to a place of shelter The
nearest house was Elizabeth Endorfields in Higher Mellstock whose
cottage and garden stood not far from the junction of that hamlet with
the road she followed Fancy hastened onward and in five minutes
entered a gate which shed upon her toes a flood of waterdrops as she
opened it

Come in chiel a voice exclaimed before Fancy had knocked a
promptness that would have surprised her had she not known that Mrs
Endorfield was an exceedingly and exceptionally sharp woman in the use of
her eyes and ears

Fancy went in and sat down Elizabeth was paring potatoes for her
husbands supper

Scrape scrape scrape then a toss and splash went a potato into a
bucket of water

Now as Fancy listlessly noted these proceedings of the dame she began
to reconsider an old subject that lay uppermost in her heart Since the
interview between her father and Dick the days had been melancholy days
for her Geoffreys firm opposition to the notion of Dick as a sonin
law was more than she had expected She had frequently seen her lover
since that time it is true and had loved him more for the opposition
than she would have otherwise dreamt of doingwhich was a happiness of a
certain kind Yet though love is thus an end in itself it must be
believed to be the means to another end if it is to assume the rosy hues
of an unalloyed pleasure And such a belief Fancy and Dick were
emphatically denied just now

Elizabeth Endorfield had a repute among women which was in its nature
something between distinction and notoriety It was founded on the
following items of character She was shrewd and penetrating her house
stood in a lonely place she never went to church she wore a red cloak
she always retained her bonnet indoors and she had a pointed chin Thus
far her attributes were distinctly Satanic and those who looked no
further called her in plain terms a witch But she was not gaunt nor
ugly in the upper part of her face nor particularly strange in manner
so that when her more intimate acquaintances spoke of her the term was
softened and she became simply a Deep Body who was as longheaded as
she was high It may be stated that Elizabeth belonged to a class of
suspects who were gradually losing their mysterious characteristics under
the administration of the young vicar though during the long reign of
Mr Grinham the parish of Mellstock had proved extremely favourable to
the growth of witches

While Fancy was revolving all this in her mind and putting it to herself
whether it was worth while to tell her troubles to Elizabeth and ask her
advice in getting out of them the witch spoke

You be downproper down she said suddenly dropping another potato
into the bucket

Fancy took no notice

About your young man

Fancy reddened Elizabeth seemed to be watching her thoughts Really
one would almost think she must have the powers people ascribed to her

Father not in the humour fort hey Another potato was finished and
flung in Ah I know about it Little birds tell me things that people
dont dream of my knowing

Fancy was desperate about Dick and here was a chanceO such a wicked
chanceof getting help and what was goodness beside love

I wish youd tell me how to put him in the humour for it she said

That I could soon do said the witch quietly

Really O do anyhowI dont careso that it is done How could I
do it Mrs Endorfield

Nothing so mighty wonderful in it

Well but how

By witchery of course said Elizabeth

No said Fancy

Tis I assure ye Didnt you ever hear I was a witch

Well hesitated Fancy I have heard you called so

And you believed it

I cant say that I did exactly believe it for tis very horrible and
wicked but O how I do wish it was possible for you to be one

So I am And Ill tell you how to bewitch your father to let you marry
Dick Dewy

Will it hurt him poor thing

Hurt who

Father

No the charm is worked by common sense and the spell can only be broke
by your acting stupidly

Fancy looked rather perplexed and Elizabeth went on

 This fear of Lizzwhatever tis
 By great and small
 She makes pretence to common sense
 And thats all

You must do it like this The witch laid down her knife and potato
and then poured into Fancys ear a long and detailed list of directions
glancing up from the corner of her eye into Fancys face with an
expression of sinister humour Fancys face brightened clouded rose
and sank as the narrative proceeded There said Elizabeth at length
stooping for the knife and another potato do that and youll have him
bylong and bylate my dear

And do it I will said Fancy

She then turned her attention to the external world once more The rain
continued as usual but the wind had abated considerably during the
discourse Judging that it was now possible to keep an umbrella erect
she pulled her hood again over her bonnet bade the witch goodbye and
went her way



CHAPTER IV THE SPELL


Mrs Endorfields advice was duly followed

I be proper sorry that your daughter isnt so well as she might be
said a Mellstock man to Geoffrey one morning

But is there anything in it said Geoffrey uneasily as he shifted his
hat to the right I cant understand the report She didnt complain
to me a bit when I saw her

No appetite at all they say

Geoffrey crossed to Mellstock and called at the school that afternoon
Fancy welcomed him as usual and asked him to stay and take tea with her

I bent much for tea this time o day he said but stayed

During the meal he watched her narrowly And to his great consternation
discovered the following unprecedented change in the healthy girlthat
she cut herself only a diaphanous slice of breadandbutter and laying
it on her plate passed the mealtime in breaking it into pieces but
eating no more than about onetenth of the slice Geoffrey hoped she
would say something about Dick and finish up by weeping as she had done
after the decision against him a few days subsequent to the interview in
the garden But nothing was said and in due time Geoffrey departed
again for Yalbury Wood

Tis to be hoped poor Miss Fancy will be able to keep on her school
said Geoffreys man Enoch to Geoffrey the following week as they were
shovelling up anthills in the wood

Geoffrey stuck in the shovel swept seven or eight ants from his sleeve
and killed another that was prowling round his ear then looked
perpendicularly into the earth as usual waiting for Enoch to say more
Well why shouldnt she said the keeper at last

The baker told me yesterday continued Enoch shaking out another emmet
that had run merrily up his thigh that the bread heve left at that
there schoolhouse this last month would starve any mouse in the three
creations that twould so And afterwards I had a pint o small down at
Morrss and there I heard more

What might that ha been

That she used to have a pound o the best rolled butter a week regular
as clockwork from Dairyman Vineys for herself as well as just so much
salted for the helping girl and the ooman she calls in but now the
same quantity dlast her three weeks and then tis thoughted she throws
it away sour

Finish doing the emmets and carry the bag homealong The keeper
resumed his gun tucked it under his arm and went on without whistling
to the dogs who however followed with a bearing meant to imply that
they did not expect any such attentions when their master was reflecting

On Saturday morning a note came from Fancy He was not to trouble about
sending her the couple of rabbits as was intended because she feared
she should not want them Later in the day Geoffrey went to Casterbridge
and called upon the butcher who served Fancy with fresh meat which was
put down to her fathers account

Ive called to pay up our little bill Neighbour Haylock and you can
gie me the chiels account at the same time

Mr Haylock turned round three quarters of a circle in the midst of a
heap of joints altered the expression of his face from meat to money
went into a little office consisting only of a door and a window looked
very vigorously into a book which possessed length but no breadth and
then seizing a piece of paper and scribbling thereupon handed the bill

Probably it was the first time in the history of commercial transactions
that the quality of shortness in a butchers bill was a cause of
tribulation to the debtor Why this isnt all sheve had in a whole
month said Geoffrey

Every mossel said the butchernow Dan take that leg and shoulder
to Mrs Whites and this eleven pound here to Mr Martinsyouve been
treating her to smaller joints lately to my thinking Mr Day

Only two or three little scram rabbits this last week as I am aliveI
wish I had

Well my wife said to meDan not too much not too much on that tray
at a time better go twicemy wife said to me as she posted up the
books she says Miss Day must have been affronted this summer during
that hot muggy weather that spolit so much for us for depend upont
she says sheve been trying John Grimmett unknown to us see her
account else Tis little of course at the best of times being only
for one but now tis next kin to nothing

Ill inquire said Geoffrey despondingly

He returned by way of Mellstock and called upon Fancy in fulfilment of
a promise It being Saturday the children were enjoying a holiday and
on entering the residence Fancy was nowhere to be seen Nan the
charwoman was sweeping the kitchen

Wheres my dater said the keeper

Well you see she was tired with the weeks teaching and this morning
she said Nan I shant get up till the evening You see Mr Day if
people dont eat they cant work and as sheve gied up eating she
must gie up working

Have ye carried up any dinner to her

No she dont want any There we all know that such things dont come
without good reasonnot that I wish to say anything about a broken
heart or anything of the kind

Geoffreys own heart felt inconveniently large just then He went to the
staircase and ascended to his daughters door

Fancy

Come in father

To see a person in bed from any cause whatever on a fine afternoon is
depressing enough and here was his only child Fancy not only in bed
but looking very pale Geoffrey was visibly disturbed

Fancy I didnt expect to see thee here chiel he said Whats the
matter

Im not well father

Hows that

Because I think of things

What things can you have to think o so mortal much

You know father

You think Ive been cruel to thee in saying that that penniless Dick o
thine shant marry thee I suppose

No answer

Well you know Fancy I do it for the best and he isnt good enough
for thee You know that well enough Here he again looked at her as
she lay Well Fancy I cant let my only chiel die and if you cant
live without en you must ha en I suppose

O I dont want him like that all against your will and everything so
disobedient sighed the invalid

No no tisnt against my will My wish is now I dsee how tis
hurten thee to live without en that he shall marry thee as soon as weve
considered a little Thats my wish flat and plain Fancy There never
cry my little maid You ought to ha cried afore no need o crying now
tis all over Well howsoever try to step over and see me and mother
law tomorrow and ha a bit of dinner wi us

AndDick too

Ay Dick too fars I know

And when do you think youll have considered father and he may marry
me she coaxed

Well there say next Midsummer thats not a day too long to wait

On leaving the school Geoffrey went to the tranters Old William opened
the door

Is your grandson Dick in ithin William

No not just now Mr Day Though heve been at home a good deal
lately

O hows that

What wi one thing and what wi tother hes all in a mope as might
be said Dont seem the feller he used to Ay a will sit studding and
thinking as if a were going to turn chapelmember and then do nothing
but traypse and wamble about Used to be such a chatty boy too Dick
did and now a dont speak at all But wont ye step inside Reuben
will be home soon a blieve

No thank you I cant stay now Will ye just ask Dick if hell do me
the kindness to step over to Yalbury tomorrow with my dater Fancy if
shes well enough I dont like her to come by herself now shes not so
terrible topping in health

So Ive heard Ay sure Ill tell him without fail



CHAPTER V AFTER GAINING HER POINT


The visit to Geoffrey passed off as delightfully as a visit might have
been expected to pass off when it was the first day of smooth experience
in a hitherto obstructed lovecourse And then came a series of several
happy days of the same undisturbed serenity Dick could court her when
he chose stay away when he chosewhich was never walk with her by
winding streams and waterfalls and autumn scenery till dews and twilight
sent them home And thus they drew near the day of the Harvest
Thanksgiving which was also the time chosen for opening the organ in
Mellstock Church

It chanced that Dick on that very day was called away from Mellstock A
young acquaintance had died of consumption at Charmley a neighbouring
village on the previous Monday and Dick in fulfilment of a
longstanding promise was to assist in carrying him to the grave When
on Tuesday Dick went towards the school to acquaint Fancy with the fact
it is difficult to say whether his own disappointment at being denied the
sight of her triumphant debut as organist was greater than his vexation
that his pet should on this great occasion be deprived of the pleasure of
his presence However the intelligence was communicated She bore it
as she best could not without many expressions of regret and
convictions that her performance would be nothing to her now

Just before eleven oclock on Sunday he set out upon his sad errand The
funeral was to be immediately after the morning service and as there
were four good miles to walk driving being inconvenient it became
necessary to start comparatively early Half an hour later would
certainly have answered his purpose quite as well yet at the last moment
nothing would content his ardent mind but that he must go a mile out of
his way in the direction of the school in the hope of getting a glimpse
of his Love as she started for church

Striking therefore into the lane towards the school instead of across
the ewelease direct to Charmley he arrived opposite her door as his
goddess emerged

If ever a woman looked a divinity Fancy Day appeared one that morning as
she floated down those school steps in the form of a nebulous collection
of colours inclining to blue With an audacity unparalleled in the whole
history of villageschoolmistresses at this datepartly owing no
doubt to papas respectable accumulation of cash which rendered her
profession not altogether one of necessityshe had actually donned a hat
and feather and lowered her hitherto plainly loopedup hair which now
fell about her shoulders in a profusion of curls Poor Dick was
astonished he had never seen her look so distractingly beautiful before
save on Christmaseve when her hair was in the same luxuriant condition
of freedom But his first burst of delighted surprise was followed by
less comfortable feelings as soon as his brain recovered its power to
think

Fancy had blushedwas it with confusion She had also involuntarily
pressed back her curls She had not expected him

Fancy you didnt know me for a moment in my funeral clothes did you

Goodmorning Dickno really I didnt know you for an instant in such
a sad suit

He looked again at the gay tresses and hat Youve never dressed so
charming before dearest

I like to hear you praise me in that way Dick she said smiling
archly It is meat and drink to a woman Do I look nice really

Fie you know it Did you rememberI mean didnt you remember about
my going away today

Well yes I did Dick but you know I wanted to look wellforgive
me

Yes darling yes of coursetheres nothing to forgive No I was
only thinking that when we talked on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday about my absence today and I was so sorry for it you said
Fancy so were you sorry and almost cried and said it would be no
pleasure to you to be the attraction of the church today since I could
not be there

My dear one neither will it be so much pleasure to me    But I do
take a little delight in my life I suppose she pouted

Apart from mine

She looked at him with perplexed eyes I know you are vexed with me
Dick and it is because the first Sunday I have curls and a hat and
feather since I have been here happens to be the very day you are away
and wont be with me Yes say it is for that is it And you think
that all this week I ought to have remembered you wouldnt be here to
day and not have cared to be better dressed than usual Yes you do
Dick and it is rather unkind

No no said Dick earnestly and simply I didnt think so badly of you
as that I only thought thatif you had been going away I shouldnt
have tried new attractions for the eyes of other people But then of
course you and I are different naturally

Well perhaps we are

Whatever will the vicar say Fancy

I dont fear what he says in the least she answered proudly But he
wont say anything of the sort you think No no

He can hardly have conscience to indeed

Now come you say Dick that you quite forgive me for I must go she
said with sudden gaiety and skipped backwards into the porch Come
here sirsay you forgive me and then you shall kiss meyou never
have yet when I have worn curls you know Yes just where you want to
so muchyes you may

Dick followed her into the inner corner where he was probably not slow
in availing himself of the privilege offered

Now thats a treat for you isnt it she continued Goodbye or I
shall be late Come and see me tomorrow youll be tired tonight

Thus they parted and Fancy proceeded to the church The organ stood on
one side of the chancel close to and under the immediate eye of the
vicar when he was in the pulpit and also in full view of the
congregation Here she sat down for the first time in such a
conspicuous position her seat having previously been in a remote spot in
the aisle

Good heavensdisgraceful Curls and a hat and feather said the
daughters of the small gentry who had either only curly hair without a
hat and feather or a hat and feather without curly hair A bonnet for
church always said sober matrons

That Mr Maybold was conscious of her presence close beside him during
the sermon that he was not at all angry at her development of costume
that he admired her she perceived But she did not see that he loved
her during that sermontime as he had never loved a woman before that
her proximity was a strange delight to him and that he gloried in her
musical success that morning in a spirit quite beyond a mere clerics
glory at the inauguration of a new order of things

The old choir with humbled hearts no longer took their seats in the
gallery as heretofore which was now given up to the schoolchildren who
were not singers and a pupilteacher but were scattered about with
their wives in different parts of the church Having nothing to do with
conducting the service for almost the first time in their lives they all
felt awkward out of place abashed and inconvenienced by their hands
The tranter had proposed that they should stay away today and go
nutting but grandfather William would not hear of such a thing for a
moment No he replied reproachfully and quoted a verse Though this
has come upon us let not our hearts be turned back or our steps go out
of the way

So they stood and watched the curls of hair trailing down the back of the
successful rival and the waving of her feather as she swayed her head
After a few timid notes and uncertain touches her playing became markedly
correct and towards the end full and free But whether from prejudice
or unbiassed judgment the venerable body of musicians could not help
thinking that the simpler notes they had been wont to bring forth were
more in keeping with the simplicity of their old church than the crowded
chords and interludes it was her pleasure to produce



CHAPTER VI INTO TEMPTATION


The day was done and Fancy was again in the schoolhouse About five
oclock it began to rain and in rather a dull frame of mind she wandered
into the schoolroom for want of something better to do She was
thinkingof her lover Dick Dewy Not precisely Of how weary she was
of living alone how unbearable it would be to return to Yalbury under
the rule of her strangetempered stepmother that it was far better to
be married to anybody than do that that eight or nine long months had
yet to be lived through ere the wedding could take place

At the side of the room were high windows of Hamhill stone upon either
sill of which she could sit by first mounting a desk and using it as a
footstool As the evening advanced here she perched herself as was her
custom on such wet and gloomy occasions put on a light shawl and bonnet
opened the window and looked out at the rain

The window overlooked a field called the Grove and it was the position
from which she used to survey the crown of Dicks passing hat in the
early days of their acquaintance and meetings Not a living soul was now
visible anywhere the rain kept all people indoors who were not forced
abroad by necessity and necessity was less importunate on Sundays than
during the week

Sitting here and thinking againof her lover or of the sensation she
had created at church that daywell it is unknownthinking and
thinking she saw a dark masculine figure arising into distinctness at the
further end of the Grovea man without an umbrella Nearer and nearer
he came and she perceived that he was in deep mourning and then that it
was Dick Yes in the fondness and foolishness of his young heart after
walking four miles in a drizzling rain without overcoat or umbrella and
in face of a remark from his love that he was not to come because he
would be tired he had made it his business to wander this mile out of
his way again from sheer wish of spending ten minutes in her presence

O Dick how wet you are she said as he drew up under the window
Why your coat shines as if it had been varnished and your hatmy
goodness theres a streaming hat

O I dont mind darling said Dick cheerfully Wet never hurts me
though I am rather sorry for my best clothes However it couldnt be
helped we lent all the umbrellas to the women I dont know when I
shall get mine back

And look theres a nasty patch of something just on your shoulder

Ah thats japanning it rubbed off the clamps of poor Jacks coffin
when we lowered him from our shoulders upon the bier I dont care about
that for twas the last deed I could do for him and tis hard if you
cant afford a coat for an old friend

Fancy put her hand to her mouth for half a minute Underneath the palm
of that little hand there existed for that halfminute a little yawn

Dick I dont like you to stand there in the wet And you mustnt sit
down Go home and change your things Dont stay another minute

One kiss after coming so far he pleaded

If I can reach then

He looked rather disappointed at not being invited round to the door She
twisted from her seated position and bent herself downwards but not even
by standing on the plinth was it possible for Dick to get his lips into
contact with hers as she held them By great exertion she might have
reached a little lower but then she would have exposed her head to the
rain

Never mind Dick kiss my hand she said flinging it down to him
Now goodbye

Goodbye

He walked slowly away turning and turning again to look at her till he
was out of sight During the retreat she said to herself almost
involuntarily and still conscious of that mornings triumphI like
Dick and I love him but how plain and sorry a man looks in the rain
with no umbrella and wet through

As he vanished she made as if to descend from her seat but glancing in
the other direction she saw another form coming along the same track It
was also that of a man He too was in black from top to toe but he
carried an umbrella

He drew nearer and the direction of the rain caused him so to slant his
umbrella that from her height above the ground his head was invisible as
she was also to him He passed in due time directly beneath her and in
looking down upon the exterior of his umbrella her feminine eyes
perceived it to be of superior silkless common at that date than
sinceand of elegant make He reached the entrance to the building and
Fancy suddenly lost sight of him Instead of pursuing the roadway as
Dick had done he had turned sharply round into her own porch

She jumped to the floor hastily flung off her shawl and bonnet smoothed
and patted her hair till the curls hung in passable condition and
listened No knock Nearly a minute passed and still there was no
knock Then there arose a soft series of raps no louder than the
tapping of a distant woodpecker and barely distinct enough to reach her
ears She composed herself and flung open the door

In the porch stood Mr Maybold

There was a warm flush upon his face and a bright flash in his eyes
which made him look handsomer than she had ever seen him before

Goodevening Miss Day

Goodevening Mr Maybold she said in a strange state of mind She
had noticed beyond the ardent hue of his face that his voice had a
singular tremor in it and that his hand shook like an aspen leaf when he
laid his umbrella in the corner of the porch Without another word being
spoken by either he came into the schoolroom shut the door and moved
close to her Once inside the expression of his face was no more
discernible by reason of the increasing dusk of evening

I want to speak to you he then said seriouslyon a perhaps
unexpected subject but one which is all the world to meI dont know
what it may be to you Miss Day

No reply

Fancy I have come to ask you if you will be my wife

As a person who has been idly amusing himself with rolling a snowball
might start at finding he had set in motion an avalanche so did Fancy
start at these words from the vicar And in the dead silence which
followed them the breathings of the man and of the woman could be
distinctly and separately heard and there was this difference between
themhis respirations gradually grew quieter and less rapid after the
enunciation hers from having been low and regular increased in
quickness and force till she almost panted

I cannot I cannot Mr MayboldI cannot Dont ask me she said

Dont answer in a hurry he entreated And do listen to me This is
no sudden feeling on my part I have loved you for more than six months
Perhaps my late interest in teaching the children here has not been so
singleminded as it seemed You will understand my motivelike me
better perhaps for honestly telling you that I have struggled against
my emotion continually because I have thought that it was not well for
me to love you But I resolved to struggle no longer I have examined
the feeling and the love I bear you is as genuine as that I could bear
any woman I see your great charm I respect your natural talents and
the refinement they have brought into your naturethey are quite enough
and more than enough for me They are equal to anything ever required of
the mistress of a quiet parsonagehousethe place in which I shall pass
my days wherever it may be situated O Fancy I have watched you
criticized you even severely brought my feelings to the light of
judgment and still have found them rational and such as any man might
have expected to be inspired with by a woman like you So there is
nothing hurried secret or untoward in my desire to do this Fancy
will you marry me

No answer was returned

Dont refuse dont he implored It would be foolish of youI mean
cruel Of course we would not live here Fancy I have had for a long
time the offer of an exchange of livings with a friend in Yorkshire but
I have hitherto refused on account of my mother There we would go Your
musical powers shall be still further developed you shall have whatever
pianoforte you like you shall have anything Fancy anything to make you
happyponycarriage flowers birds pleasant society yes you have
enough in you for any society after a few months of travel with me Will
you Fancy marry me

Another pause ensued varied only by the surging of the rain against the
windowpanes and then Fancy spoke in a faint and broken voice

Yes I will she said

God bless you my own He advanced quickly and put his arm out to
embrace her She drew back hastily No no not now she said in an
agitated whisper There are thingsbut the temptation is O too
strong and I cant resist it I cant tell you now but I must tell you
Dont please dont come near me now I want to think I can scarcely
get myself used to the idea of what I have promised yet The next
minute she turned to a desk buried her face in her hands and burst into
a hysterical fit of weeping O leave me to myself she sobbed leave
me O leave me

Dont be distressed dont dearest It was with visible difficulty
that he restrained himself from approaching her You shall tell me at
your leisure what it is that grieves you so I am happybeyond all
measure happyat having your simple promise

And do go and leave me now

But I must not in justice to you leave for a minute until you are
yourself again

There then she said controlling her emotion and standing up I am
not disturbed now

He reluctantly moved towards the door Goodbye he murmured tenderly
Ill come tomorrow about this time



CHAPTER VII SECOND THOUGHTS


The next morning the vicar rose early The first thing he did was to
write a long and careful letter to his friend in Yorkshire Then eating
a little breakfast he crossed the meadows in the direction of
Casterbridge bearing his letter in his pocket that he might post it at
the town office and obviate the loss of one day in its transmission that
would have resulted had he left it for the footpost through the village

It was a foggy morning and the trees shed in noisy waterdrops the
moisture they had collected from the thick air an acorn occasionally
falling from its cup to the ground in company with the drippings In
the meads sheets of spidersweb almost opaque with wet hung in folds
over the fences and the falling leaves appeared in every variety of
brown green and yellow hue

A low and merry whistling was heard on the highway he was approaching
then the light footsteps of a man going in the same direction as himself
On reaching the junction of his path with the road the vicar beheld Dick
Dewys open and cheerful face Dick lifted his hat and the vicar came
out into the highway that Dick was pursuing

Goodmorning Dewy How well you are looking said Mr Maybold

Yes sir I am wellquite well I am going to Casterbridge now to get
Smarts collar we left it there Saturday to be repaired

I am going to Casterbridge so well walk together the vicar said
Dick gave a hop with one foot to put himself in step with Mr Maybold
who proceeded I fancy I didnt see you at church yesterday Dewy Or
were you behind the pier

No I went to Charmley Poor John Dunford chose me to be one of his
bearers a long time before he died and yesterday was the funeral Of
course I couldnt refuse though I should have liked particularly to have
been at home as twas the day of the new music

Yes you should have been The musical portion of the service was
successfulvery successful indeed and what is more to the purpose no
illfeeling whatever was evinced by any of the members of the old choir
They joined in the singing with the greatest goodwill

Twas natural enough that I should want to be there I suppose said
Dick smiling a private smile considering who the organplayer was

At this the vicar reddened a little and said Yes yes though not at
all comprehending Dicks true meaning who as he received no further
reply continued hesitatingly and with another smile denoting his pride
as a lover

I suppose you know what I mean sir Youve heard about me andMiss
Day

The red in Maybolds countenance went away he turned and looked Dick in
the face

No he said constrainedly Ive heard nothing whatever about you and
Miss Day

Why shes my sweetheart and we are going to be married next Midsummer
We are keeping it rather close just at present because tis a good many
months to wait but it is her fathers wish that we dont marry before
and of course we must submit But the time ill soon slip along

Yes the time will soon slip alongTime glides away every dayyes

Maybold said these words but he had no idea of what they were He was
conscious of a cold and sickly thrill throughout him and all he reasoned
was this that the young creature whose graces had intoxicated him into
making the most imprudent resolution of his life was less an angel than
a woman

You see sir continued the ingenuous Dick twill be better in one
sense I shall by that time be the regular manager of a branch o
fathers business which has very much increased lately and business
which we think of starting elsewhere It has very much increased lately
and we expect next year to keep a extra couple of horses Weve already
our eye on onebrown as a berry neck like a rainbow fifteen hands and
not a gray hair in heroffered us at twentyfive want a crown And to
kip pace with the times I have had some cards prented and I beg leave to
hand you one sir

Certainly said the vicar mechanically taking the card that Dick
offered him

I turn in here by Greys Bridge said Dick I suppose you go straight
on and up town

Yes

Goodmorning sir

Goodmorning Dewy

Maybold stood still upon the bridge holding the card as it had been put
into his hand and Dicks footsteps died away towards Durnover Mill The
vicars first voluntary action was to read the card

 DEWY AND SON
 TRANTERS AND HAULIERS
 MELLSTOCK
 NBFurniture Coals Potatoes Live and Dead Stock removed to any
 distance on the shortest notice

Mr Maybold leant over the parapet of the bridge and looked into the
river He sawwithout heedinghow the water came rapidly from beneath
the arches glided down a little steep then spread itself over a pool in
which dace trout and minnows sported at ease among the long green locks
of weed that lay heaving and sinking with their roots towards the
current At the end of ten minutes spent leaning thus he drew from his
pocket the letter to his friend tore it deliberately into such minute
fragments that scarcely two syllables remained in juxtaposition and sent
the whole handful of shreds fluttering into the water Here he watched
them eddy dart and turn as they were carried downwards towards the
ocean and gradually disappeared from his view Finally he moved off and
pursued his way at a rapid pace back again to Mellstock Vicarage

Nerving himself by a long and intense effort he sat down in his study
and wrote as follows

 DEAR MISS DAYThe meaning of your words the temptation is too
 strong of your sadness and your tears has been brought home to me
 by an accident I know today what I did not know yesterdaythat you
 are not a free woman

 Why did you not tell mewhy didnt you Did you suppose I knew No
 Had I known my conduct in coming to you as I did would have been
 reprehensible

 But I dont chide you Perhaps no blame attaches to youI cant
 tell Fancy though my opinion of you is assailed and disturbed in a
 way which cannot be expressed I love you still and my word to you
 holds good yet But will you in justice to an honest man who relies
 upon your word to him consider whether under the circumstances you
 can honourably forsake himYours ever sincerely

 ARTHUR MAYBOLD

He rang the bell Tell Charles to take these copybooks and this note to
the school at once

The maid took the parcel and the letter and in a few minutes a boy was
seen to leave the vicarage gate with the one under his arm and the
other in his hand The vicar sat with his hand to his brow watching the
lad as he descended Church Lane and entered the waterside path which
intervened between that spot and the school

Here he was met by another boy and after a free salutation and
pugilistic frisk had passed between the two the second boy came on his
way to the vicarage and the other vanished out of sight

The boy came to the door and a note for Mr Maybold was brought in

He knew the writing Opening the envelope with an unsteady hand he read
the subjoined words

 DEAR MR MAYBOLDI have been thinking seriously and sadly through
 the whole of the night of the question you put to me last evening and
 of my answer That answer as an honest woman I had no right to
 give

 It is my natureperhaps all womensto love refinement of mind and
 manners but even more than this to be ever fascinated with the idea
 of surroundings more elegant and pleasing than those which have been
 customary And you praised me and praise is life to me It was
 alone my sensations at these things which prompted my reply Ambition
 and vanity they would be called perhaps they are so

 After this explanation I hope you will generously allow me to
 withdraw the answer I too hastily gave

 And one more request To keep the meeting of last night and all
 that passed between us there for ever a secret Were it to become
 known it would utterly blight the happiness of a trusting and
 generous man whom I love still and shall love alwaysYours
 sincerely

 FANCY DAY

The last written communication that ever passed from the vicar to Fancy
was a note containing these words only

 Tell him everything it is best He will forgive you




PART THE FIFTH CONCLUSION


CHAPTER I THE KNOT THERES NO UNTYING


The last day of the story is dated just subsequent to that point in the
development of the seasons when country people go to bed among nearly
naked trees are lulled to sleep by a fall of rain and awake next
morning among green ones when the landscape appears embarrassed with the
sudden weight and brilliancy of its leaves when the nightjar comes and
strikes up for the summer his tune of one note when the appletrees have
bloomed and the roads and orchardgrass become spotted with fallen
petals when the faces of the delicate flowers are darkened and their
heads weighed down by the throng of honeybees which increase their
humming till humming is too mild a term for the allpervading sound and
when cuckoos blackbirds and sparrows that have hitherto been merry and
respectful neighbours become noisy and persistent intimates

The exterior of Geoffrey Days house in Yalbury Wood appeared exactly as
was usual at that season but a frantic barking of the dogs at the back
told of unwonted movements somewhere within Inside the door the eyes
beheld a gathering which was a rarity indeed for the dwelling of the
solitary woodsteward and keeper

About the room were sitting and standing in various gnarled attitudes
our old acquaintance grandfathers James and William the tranter Mr
Penny two or three children including Jimmy and Charley besides three
or four country ladies and gentlemen from a greater distance who do not
require any distinction by name Geoffrey was seen and heard stamping
about the outhouse and among the bushes of the garden attending to
details of daily routine before the proper time arrived for their
performance in order that they might be off his hands for the day He
appeared with his shirtsleeves rolled up his best new nether garments
in which he had arrayed himself that morning being temporarily disguised
under a weekday apron whilst these proceedings were in operation He
occasionally glanced at the hives in passing to see if his wifes bees
were swarming ultimately rolling down his shirtsleeves and going
indoors talking to tranter Dewy whilst buttoning the wristbands to save
time next going upstairs for his best waistcoat and coming down again
to make another remark whilst buttoning that during the time looking
fixedly in the tranters face as if he were a lookingglass

The furniture had undergone attenuation to an alarming extent every
duplicate piece having been removed including the clock by Thomas Wood
Ezekiel Saunders being at last left sole referee in matters of time

Fancy was stationary upstairs receiving her layers of clothes and
adornments and answering by short fragments of laughter which had more
fidgetiness than mirth in them remarks that were made from time to time
by Mrs Dewy and Mrs Penny who were assisting her at the toilet Mrs
Day having pleaded a queerness in her head as a reason for shutting
herself up in an inner bedroom for the whole morning Mrs Penny
appeared with nine corkscrew curls on each side of her temples and a
back comb stuck upon her crown like a castle on a steep

The conversation just now going on was concerning the banns the last
publication of which had been on the Sunday previous

And how did they sound Fancy subtly inquired

Very beautiful indeed said Mrs Penny I never heard any sound
better

But how

O so natural and elegant didnt they Reuben she cried through the
chinks of the unceiled floor to the tranter downstairs

Whats that said the tranter looking up inquiringly at the floor
above him for an answer

Didnt Dick and Fancy sound well when they were called home in church
last Sunday came downwards again in Mrs Pennys voice

Ay that they did my sonniesespecially the first time There was a
terrible whispering piece of work in the congregation wasnt there
neighbour Penny said the tranter taking up the thread of conversation
on his own account and in order to be heard in the room above speaking
very loud to Mr Penny who sat at the distance of three feet from him
or rather less

I never can mind seeing such a whispering as there was said Mr Penny
also loudly to the room above And such sorrowful envy on the maidens
faces really I never did see such envy as there was

Fancys lineaments varied in innumerable little flushes and her heart
palpitated innumerable little tremors of pleasure But perhaps she
said with assumed indifference it was only because no religion was
going on just then

O no nothing to do with that Twas because of your high standing in
the parish It was just as if they had one and all caught Dick kissing
and coling ye to death wasnt it Mrs Dewy

Ay that twas

How people will talk about ones doings Fancy exclaimed

Well if you make songs about yourself my dear you cant blame other
people for singing em

Mercy me how shall I go through it said the young lady again but
merely to those in the bedroom with a breathing of a kind between a sigh
and a pant round shining eyes and warm face

O youll get through it well enough child said Mrs Dewy placidly
The edge of the performance is took off at the calling home and when
once you get up to the chancel end o the church you feel as saucy as
you please Im sure I felt as brave as a sodger all through the
deedthough of course I dropped my face and looked modest as was
becoming to a maid Mind you do that Fancy

And I walked into the church as quiet as a lamb Im sure subjoined
Mrs Penny There you see Penny is such a little small man But
certainly I was flurried in the inside o me Well thinks I tis to
be and here goes And do you do the same say Tis to be and here
goes

Is there such wonderful virtue in Tis to be and here goes inquired
Fancy

Wonderful Twill carry a body through it all from wedding to
churching if you only let it out with spirit enough

Very well then said Fancy blushing Tis to be and here goes

Thats a girl for a husband said Mrs Dewy

I do hope hell come in time continued the brideelect inventing a
new cause of affright now that the other was demolished

Twould be a thousand pities if he didnt come now you be so brave
said Mrs Penny

Grandfather James having overheard some of these remarks said
downstairs with mischievous loudness

Ive known some wouldbe weddings when the men didnt come

Theyve happened not to come before now certainly said Mr Penny
cleaning one of the glasses of his spectacles

O do hear what they are saying downstairs whispered Fancy Hush
hush

She listened

They have havent they Geoffrey continued grandfather James as
Geoffrey entered

Have what said Geoffrey

The men have been known not to come

That they have said the keeper

Ay Ive knowed times when the wedding had to be put off through his not
appearing being tired of the woman And another case I knowed was when
the man was catched in a mantrap crossing Oakers Wood and the three
months had run out before he got well and the banns had to be published
over again

How horrible said Fancy

They only say it on purpose to tease ee my dear said Mrs Dewy

Tis quite sad to think what wretched shifts poor maids have been put
to came again from downstairs Ye should hear Clerk Wilkins my
brotherlaw tell his experiences in marrying couples these last thirty
year sometimes one thing sometimes anothertis quite
heartrendingenough to make your hair stand on end

Those things dont happen very often I know said Fancy with
smouldering uneasiness

Well really tis time Dick was here said the tranter

Dont keep on at me so grandfather James and Mr Dewy and all you down
there Fancy broke out unable to endure any longer I am sure I shall
die or do something if you do

Never you hearken to these old chaps Miss Day cried Nat Callcome the
best man who had just entered and threw his voice upward through the
chinks of the floor as the others had done Tis all right Dicks
coming on like a wild feller hell be here in a minute The hive o
bees his mother gied en for his new garden swarmed jist as he was
starting and he said I cant afford to lose a stock o bees no that
I cant though I fain would and Fancy wouldnt wish it on any account
So he jist stopped to ting to em and shake em

A genuine wise man said Geoffrey

To be sure what a days work we had yesterday Mr Callcome continued
lowering his voice as if it were not necessary any longer to include
those in the room above among his audience and selecting a remote corner
of his best clean handkerchief for wiping his face To be sure

Things so heavy I suppose said Geoffrey as if reading through the
chimneywindow from the far end of the vista

Ay said Nat looking round the room at points from which furniture had
been removed And so awkward to carry too Twas athart and across
Dicks garden in and out Dicks door up and down Dicks stairs round
and round Dicks chammers till legs were worn to stumps and Dick is so
particular too And the stores of victuals and drink that lad has laid
in why tis enough for Noahs ark Im sure I never wish to see a
choicer halfdozen of hams than hes got there in his chimley and the
cider I tasted was a very pretty drop indeednone could desire a
prettier cider

They be for the love and the stalled ox both Ah the greedy martels
said grandfather James

Well maybe they be Surely says I that couple between em have
heaped up so much furniture and victuals that anybody would think they
were going to take hold the big end of married life first and begin wi
a grownup family Ah what a bath of heat we two chaps were in to be
sure agetting that furniture in order

I do so wish the room below was ceiled said Fancy as the dressing
went on we can hear all they say and do down there

Hark Whos that exclaimed a small pupilteacher who also assisted
this morning to her great delight She ran halfway down the stairs
and peeped round the banister O you should you should you should
she exclaimed scrambling up to the room again

What said Fancy

See the bridesmaids Theyve just a come Tis wonderful really tis
wonderful how muslin can be brought to it There they dont look a bit
like themselves but like some very rich sisters o theirs that nobody
knew they had

Make em come up to me make em come up cried Fancy ecstatically and
the four damsels appointed namely Miss Susan Dewy Miss Bessie Dewy
Miss Vashti Sniff and Miss Mercy Onmey surged upstairs and floated
along the passage

I wish Dick would come was again the burden of Fancy

The same instant a small twig and flower from the creeper outside the
door flew in at the open window and a masculine voice said Ready
Fancy dearest

There he is he is cried Fancy tittering spasmodically and breathing
as it were for the first time that morning

The bridesmaids crowded to the window and turned their heads in the
direction pointed out at which motion eight earrings all swung as
onenot looking at Dick because they particularly wanted to see him
but with an important sense of their duty as obedient ministers of the
will of that apotheosised beingthe Bride

He looks very taking said Miss Vashti Sniff a young lady who blushed
creamcolour and wore yellow bonnet ribbons

Dick was advancing to the door in a painfully new coat of shining cloth
primrosecoloured waistcoat hat of the same painful style of newness
and with an extra quantity of whiskers shaved off his face and hair cut
to an unwonted shortness in honour of the occasion

Now Ill run down said Fancy looking at herself over her shoulder in
the glass and flitting off

O Dick she exclaimed I am so glad you are come I knew you would
of course but I thought Oh if you shouldnt

Not come Fancy Het or wet blow or snow here come I today Why
whats possessing your little soul You never used to mind such things a
bit

Ah Mr Dick I hadnt hoisted my colours and committed myself then
said Fancy

Tis a pity I cant marry the whole five of ye said Dick surveying
them all round

Hehhehheh laughed the four bridesmaids and Fancy privately touched
Dick and smoothed him down behind his shoulder as if to assure herself
that he was there in flesh and blood as her own property

Well whoever would have thought such a thing said Dick taking off
his hat sinking into a chair and turning to the elder members of the
company

The latter arranged their eyes and lips to signify that in their opinion
nobody could have thought such a thing whatever it was

That my bees should ha swarmed just then of all times and seasons
continued Dick throwing a comprehensive glance like a net over the whole
auditory And tis a fine swarm too I havent seen such a fine swarm
for these ten years

A excellent sign said Mrs Penny from the depths of experience A
excellent sign

I am glad everything seems so right said Fancy with a breath of
relief

And so am I said the four bridesmaids with much sympathy

Well bees cant be put off observed the inharmonious grandfather
James Marrying a woman is a thing you can do at any moment but a
swarm o bees wont come for the asking

Dick fanned himself with his hat I cant think he said thoughtfully
whatever twas I did to offend Mr Maybold a man I like so much too He
rather took to me when he came first and used to say he should like to
see me married and that hed marry me whether the young woman I chose
lived in his parish or no I just hinted to him of it when I put in the
banns but he didnt seem to take kindly to the notion now and so I said
no more I wonder how it was

I wonder said Fancy looking into vacancy with those beautiful eyes of
herstoo refined and beautiful for a tranters wife but perhaps not
too good

Altered his mind as folks will I suppose said the tranter Well
my sonnies therell be a good strong party looking at us today as we go
along

And the body of the church said Geoffrey will be lined with females
and a row of young fellers heads as far down as the eyes will be
noticed just above the sills of the chancelwinders

Ay youve been through it twice said Reuben and well mid know

I can put up with it for once said Dick or twice either or a dozen
times

O Dick said Fancy reproachfully

Why dear thats nothingonly just a bit of a flourish You be as
nervous as a cat today

And then of course when tis all over continued the tranter we
shall march two and two round the parish

Yes sure said Mr Penny two and two every man hitched up to his
woman a blieve

I never can make a show of myself in that way said Fancy looking at
Dick to ascertain if he could

Im agreed to anything you and the company like my dear said Mr
Richard Dewy heartily

Why we did when we were married didnt we Ann said the tranter
and so do everybody my sonnies

And so did we said Fancys father

And so did Penny and I said Mrs Penny I wore my best Bath clogs I
remember and Penny was cross because it made me look so tall

And so did father and mother said Miss Mercy Onmey

And I mean to come next Christmas said Nat the groomsman vigorously
and looking towards the person of Miss Vashti Sniff

Respectable people dont nowadays said Fancy Still since poor
mother did I will

Ay resumed the tranter twas on a White Tuesday when I committed it
Mellstock Club walked the same day and we newmarried folk went agaying
round the parish behind em Everybody used to wear something white at
Whitsuntide in them days My sonnies Ive got the very white trousers
that I wore at home in box now Hant I Ann

You had till I cut em up for Jimmy said Mrs Dewy

And we ought by rights after doing this parish to go round Higher and
Lower Mellstock and call at Vineys and so work our way hither again
across Heth said Mr Penny recovering scent of the matter in hand
Dairyman Viney is a very respectable man and so is Farmer Kex and we
ought to show ourselves to them

True said the tranter we ought to go round Mellstock to do the thing
well We shall form a very striking object walking along in rotation
goodnow neighbours

That we shall a proper pretty sight for the nation said Mrs Penny

Hullo said the tranter suddenly catching sight of a singular human
figure standing in the doorway and wearing a long smockfrock of pillow
case cut and of snowy whiteness Why Leaf whatever dost thou do
here

Ive come to know if so be I can come to the weddingheehee said
Leaf in a voice of timidity

Now Leaf said the tranter reproachfully you know we dont want ee
here today weve got no room for ye Leaf

Thomas Leaf Thomas Leaf fie upon ye for prying said old William

I know Ive got no head but I thought if I washed and put on a clane
shirt and smockfrock I might just call said Leaf turning away
disappointed and trembling

Poor feller said the tranter turning to Geoffrey Suppose we must
let en come His looks are rather against en and he is terrible silly
but a have never been in jail and a wont do no harm

Leaf looked with gratitude at the tranter for these praises and then
anxiously at Geoffrey to see what effect they would have in helping his
cause

Ay let en come said Geoffrey decisively Leaf thrt welcome st
know and Leaf accordingly remained

They were now all ready for leaving the house and began to form a
procession in the following order Fancy and her father Dick and Susan
Dewy Nat Callcome and Vashti Sniff Ted Waywood and Mercy Onmey and
Jimmy and Bessie Dewy These formed the executive and all appeared in
strict wedding attire Then came the tranter and Mrs Dewy and last of
all Mr and Mrs Pennythe tranter conspicuous by his enormous gloves
size eleven and threequarters which appeared at a distance like boxing
gloves bleached and sat rather awkwardly upon his brown hands this hall
mark of respectability having been set upon himself today by Fancys
special request for the first time in his life

The proper way is for the bridesmaids to walk together suggested
Fancy

What Twas always young man and young woman arm in crook in my
time said Geoffrey astounded

And in mine said the tranter

And in ours said Mr and Mrs Penny

Never heard o such a thing as woman and woman said old William who
with grandfather James and Mrs Day was to stay at home

Whichever way you and the company like my dear said Dick who being
on the point of securing his right to Fancy seemed willing to renounce
all other rights in the world with the greatest pleasure The decision
was left to Fancy

Well I think Id rather have it the way mother had it she said and
the couples moved along under the trees every man to his maid

Ah said grandfather James to grandfather William as they retired I
wonder which she thinks most about Dick or her wedding raiment

Well tis their nature said grandfather William Remember the words
of the prophet Jeremiah Can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her
attire

Now among dark perpendicular firs like the shafted columns of a
cathedral now through a hazel copse matted with primroses and wild
hyacinths now under broad beeches in bright young leaves they threaded
their way into the high road over Yalbury Hill which dipped at that
point directly into the village of Geoffrey Days parish and in the
space of a quarter of an hour Fancy found herself to be Mrs Richard
Dewy though much to her surprise feeling no other than Fancy Day
still

On the circuitous return walk through the lanes and fields amid much
chattering and laughter especially when they came to stiles Dick
discerned a brown spot far up a turnip field

Why tis Enoch he said to Fancy I thought I missed him at the
house this morning How is it hes left you

He drank too much cider and it got into his head and they put him in
Weatherbury stocks for it Father was obliged to get somebody else for a
day or two and Enoch hasnt had anything to do with the woods since

We might ask him to call down tonight Stocks are nothing for once
considering tis our wedding day The bridal party was ordered to halt

Enooooch cried Dick at the top of his voice

Yaaaaaas said Enoch from the distance

Dye know who I beeeeee

Nooooooo

Dick Dewwwwwy

Ohhhhh

Just amaaaaaarried

Ohhhhh

This is my wife Faaaaaancy holding her up to Enochs view as if
she had been a nosegay

Ohhhhh

Will ye come across to the party toniiiiiiight

Caaaaaant

Why nooooot

Dont work for the family nooooow

Not nice of Master Enoch said Dick as they resumed their walk

You mustnt blame en said Geoffrey the mans not hisself now hes
in his morning frame of mind When hes had a gallon o cider or ale or
a pint or two of mead the mans well enough and his manners be as good
as anybodys in the kingdom



CHAPTER II UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE


The point in Yalbury Wood which abutted on the end of Geoffrey Days
premises was closed with an ancient tree horizontally of enormous
extent though having no great pretensions to height Many hundreds of
birds had been born amidst the boughs of this single tree tribes of
rabbits and hares had nibbled at its bark from year to year quaint tufts
of fungi had sprung from the cavities of its forks and countless
families of moles and earthworms had crept about its roots Beneath and
beyond its shade spread a carefullytended grassplot its purpose being
to supply a healthy exerciseground for young chickens and pheasants the
hens their mothers being enclosed in coops placed upon the same green
flooring

All these encumbrances were now removed and as the afternoon advanced
the guests gathered on the spot where music dancing and the singing of
songs went forward with great spirit throughout the evening The
propriety of every one was intense by reason of the influence of Fancy
who as an additional precaution in this direction had strictly charged
her father and the tranter to carefully avoid saying thee and thou in
their conversation on the plea that those ancient words sounded so very
humiliating to persons of newer taste also that they were never to be
seen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinkinga
local English custom of extraordinary antiquity but stated by Fancy to
be decidedly dying out among the better classes of society

In addition to the local musicians present a man who had a thorough
knowledge of the tambourine was invited from the village of Tantrum
Clangleya place long celebrated for the skill of its inhabitants as
performers on instruments of percussion These important members of the
assembly were relegated to a height of two or three feet from the ground
upon a temporary erection of planks supported by barrels Whilst the
dancing progressed the older persons sat in a group under the trunk of
the treethe space being allotted to them somewhat grudgingly by the
young ones who were greedy of pirouetting roomand fortified by a
table against the heels of the dancers Here the gaffers and gammers
whose dancing days were over told stories of great impressiveness and
at intervals surveyed the advancing and retiring couples from the same
retreat as people on shore might be supposed to survey a naval
engagement in the bay beyond returning again to their tales when the
pause was over Those of the whirling throng who during the rests
between each figure turned their eyes in the direction of these seated
ones were only able to discover on account of the music and bustle
that a very striking circumstance was in course of narrationdenoted by
an emphatic sweep of the hand snapping of the fingers close of the
lips and fixed look into the centre of the listeners eye for the space
of a quarter of a minute which raised in that listener such a
reciprocating working of face as to sometimes make the distant dancers
half wish to know what such an interesting tale could refer to

Fancy caused her looks to wear as much matronly expression as was
obtainable out of six hours experience as a wife in order that the
contrast between her own state of life and that of the unmarried young
women present might be duly impressed upon the company occasionally
stealing glances of admiration at her left hand but this quite
privately for her ostensible bearing concerning the matter was intended
to show that though she undoubtedly occupied the most wondrous position
in the eyes of the world that had ever been attained she was almost
unconscious of the circumstance and that the somewhat prominent position
in which that wonderfullyemblazoned left hand was continually found to
be placed when handing cups and saucers knives forks and glasses was
quite the result of accident As to wishing to excite envy in the bosoms
of her maiden companions by the exhibition of the shining ring every
one was to know it was quite foreign to the dignity of such an
experienced married woman Dicks imagination in the meantime was far
less capable of drawing so much wontedness from his new condition He
had been for two or three hours trying to feel himself merely a newly
married man but had been able to get no further in the attempt than to
realize that he was Dick Dewy the tranters son at a party given by
Lord Wessexs head manincharge on the outlying Yalbury estate dancing
and chatting with Fancy Day

Five country dances including Haste to the Wedding two reels and
three fragments of hornpipes brought them to the time for supper
which on account of the dampness of the grass from the immaturity of the
summer season was spread indoors At the conclusion of the meal Dick
went out to put the horse in and Fancy with the elder half of the four
bridesmaids retired upstairs to dress for the journey to Dicks new
cottage near Mellstock

How long will you be putting on your bonnet Fancy Dick inquired at
the foot of the staircase Being now a man of business and married he
was strong on the importance of time and doubled the emphasis of his
words in conversing and added vigour to his nods

Only a minute

How long is that

Well dear five

Ah sonnies said the tranter as Dick retired tis a talent of the
female race that low numbers should stand for high more especially in
matters of waiting matters of age and matters of money

True true upon my body said Geoffrey

Ye spak with feeling Geoffrey seemingly

Anybody that dknow my experience might guess that

Whats she doing now Geoffrey

Claning out all the upstairs drawers and cupboards and dusting the
secondbest chaineya thing thats only done once a year If theres
work to be done I must do it says she wedding or no

Tis my belief shes a very good woman at bottom

Shes terrible deep then

Mrs Penny turned round Well tis humps and hollers with the best of
us but still and for all that Dick and Fancy stand as fair a chance of
having a bit of sunsheen as any married pair in the land

Ay theres no gainsaying it

Mrs Dewy came up talking to one person and looking at another Happy
yes she said Tis always so when a couple is so exactly in tune with
one another as Dick and she

When they bent too poor to have time to sing said grandfather James

I tell ye neighbours when the pinch comes said the tranter when
the oldest daughters boots be only a size less than her mothers and
the rest o the flock close behind her A sharp time for a man that my
sonnies a very sharp time Chanticleers comb is acut then a
believe

Thats about the form ot said Mr Penny Thatll put the stuns upon
a man when you must measure mother and daughters lasts to tell em
apart

Youve no cause to complain Reuben of such a closecoming flock said
Mrs Dewy for ours was a straggling lot enough God knows

I dknow it I dknow it said the tranter You be a wellenough
woman Ann

Mrs Dewy put her mouth in the form of a smile and put it back again
without smiling

And if they come together they go together said Mrs Penny whose
family had been the reverse of the tranters and a little money will
make either fate tolerable And money can be made by our young couple I
know

Yes that it can said the impulsive voice of Leaf who had hitherto
humbly admired the proceedings from a corner It can be doneall
thats wanted is a few pounds to begin with Thats all I know a story
about it

Lets hear thy story Leaf said the tranter I never knew you were
clever enough to tell a story Silence all of ye Mr Leaf will tell a
story

Tell your story Thomas Leaf said grandfather William in the tone of a
schoolmaster

Once said the delighted Leaf in an uncertain voice there was a man
who lived in a house Well this man went thinking and thinking night
and day At last he said to himself as I might If I had only ten
pound Id make a fortune At last by hook or by crook behold he got
the ten pounds

Only think of that said Nat Callcome satirically

Silence said the tranter

Well now comes the interesting part of the story In a little time he
made that ten pounds twenty Then a little time after that he doubled
it and made it forty Well he went on and a good while after that he
made it eighty and on to a hundred Well byandby he made it two
hundred Well youd never believe it buthe went on and made it four
hundred He went on and what did he do Why he made it eight hundred
Yes he did continued Leaf in the highest pitch of excitement
bringing down his fist upon his knee with such force that he quivered
with the pain yes and he went on and made it A THOUSAND

Hear hear said the tranter Better than the history of England my
sonnies

Thank you for your story Thomas Leaf said grandfather William and
then Leaf gradually sank into nothingness again

Amid a medley of laughter old shoes and elderwine Dick and his bride
took their departure side by side in the excellent new springcart which
the young tranter now possessed The moon was just over the full
rendering any light from lamps or their own beauties quite unnecessary to
the pair They drove slowly along Yalbury Bottom where the road passed
between two copses Dick was talking to his companion

Fancy he said why we are so happy is because there is such full
confidence between us Ever since that time you confessed to that little
flirtation with Shiner by the river which was really no flirtation at
all I have thought how artless and good you must be to tell me o such
a trifling thing and to be so frightened about it as you were It has
won me to tell you my every deed and word since then Well have no
secrets from each other darling will we everno secret at all

None from today said Fancy Hark whats that

From a neighbouring thicket was suddenly heard to issue in a loud
musical and liquid voice

Tippiwit sweeet kikiki Come hither come hither come hither

O tis the nightingale murmured she and thought of a secret she
would never tell

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
