THE SLEEPING CARA FARCE
by William D Howells


I


SCENE One side of a sleepingcar on the Boston and Albany Road The
curtains are drawn before most of the berths from the hooks and rods
hang hats bonnets bags bandboxes umbrellas and other travelling
gear on the floor are boots of both sexes set out for THE PORTER to
black THE PORTER is making up the beds in the upper and lower berths
adjoining the seats on which a young mother slender and pretty with a
baby asleep on the seat beside her and a stout old lady sit confronting
each otherMRS AGNES ROBERTS and her aunt MARY

MRS ROBERTS Do you always take down your back hair aunty

AUNT MARY No never child at least not since I had such a fright
about it once coming on from New York Its all well enough to take
down your back hair if it _is_ yours but if it isnt your heads the
best place for it Now as I buy mine of Madame Pierrot

MRS ROBERTS Dont you _wish_ she wouldnt advertise it as _human_
hair It sounds so pokerishlike human flesh you know

AUNT MARY Why she couldnt call it _in_human hair my dear

MRS ROBERTS thoughtfully Nojust _hair_

AUNT MARY Then people might think it was for mattresses But as I was
saying I took it off that night and tucked it safely away as I
supposed in my pocket and I slept sweetly till about midnight when I
happened to open my eyes and saw something long and black crawl off my
bed and slip under the berth _Such_ a shriek as I gave my dear A
snake a snake oh a snake And everybody began talking at once and
some of the gentlemen swearing and the porter came running with the
poker to kill it and all the while it was that ridiculous switch of
mine that had worked out of my pocket And glad enough I was to grab it
up before anybody saw it and say I must have been dreaming

MRS ROBERTS Why aunty how funny How _could_ you suppose a serpent
could get on board a sleepingcar of all places in the world

AUNT MARY That was the perfect absurdity of it

THE PORTER Berths ready now ladies

MRS ROBERTS to THE PORTER who walks away to the end of the car and
sits down near the door Oh thank you Aunty do you feel nervous the
least bit

AUNT MARY Nervous No Why

MRS ROBERTS Well I dont know I suppose Ive been worked up a
little about meeting Willis and wondering how hell look and all We
cant _know_ each other of course It doesnt stand to reason that if
hes been out there for twelve years ever since I was a child though
weve corresponded regularlyat least _I_ havethat he could recognize
me not at the first glance you know Hell have a full beard and then
Ive got married and heres the baby Oh _no_ hell never guess who
it is in the world Photographs really amount to nothing in such a case
I wish we were at home and it was all over I wish he had written some
particulars instead of telegraphing from Ogden Be with you on the 7
AM Wednesday

AUNT MARY Californians always telegraph my dear they never think of
writing It isnt expensive enough and it doesnt make your blood run
cold enough to get a letter and so they send you one of those miserable
yellow despatches whenever they canthose printed in a long string if
possible so that youll be _sure_ to die before you get to the end of
it I suppose your brother has fallen into all those ways and says
reckon and ornary and which the same just like one of Mr Bret
Hartes characters

MRS ROBERTS But it isnt exactly our not knowing each other aunty
thats worrying me thats something that could be got over in time What
is simply driving me distracted is Willis and Edward meeting there when
Im away from home Oh how _could_ I be away and why _couldnt_ Willis
have given us fair warning I would have hurried from the ends of the
earth to meet him I dont believe poor Edward ever saw a Californian
and hes so quiet and preoccupied Im sure hed never get on with
Willis And if Willis is the least loud he wouldnt like Edward Not
that I suppose he _is_ loud but I dont believe he knows anything about
literary men But you can see aunty cant you how very anxious I must
be Dont you see that I ought to have been there when Willis and Edward
met so as totowell to _break_ them to each other dont you know

AUNT MARY Oh you neednt be troubled about that Agnes I dare say
theyve got on perfectly well together Very likely theyre sitting down
to the unwholesomest hot supper this instant that the ingenuity of man
could invent

MRS ROBERTS Oh do you _think_ they are aunty Oh if I could _only_
believe they were sitting down to a hot supper together now I should be
_so_ happy Theyd be sure to get on if they were Theres nothing like
eating to make men friendly with each other Dont you know at
receptions how they never have anything to say to each other till the
escalloped oysters and the chicken salad appear and then how sweet they
are as soon as theyve helped the ladies to ice Oh thank you _thank_
you aunty for thinking of the hot supper Its such a relief to my
mind You can understand cant you aunty dear how anxious I must have
been to have my only brother and my onlymy husbandget on nicely
together My life would be a wreck simply a wreck if they didnt And
Willis and I not having seen each other since I was a child makes it all
the worse I do _hope_ theyre sitting down to a hot supper

AN ANGRY VOICE from the next berth but one I wish people in sleeping
cars

A VOICE from the berth beyond that Youre mistaken in your premises
sir This is a wakingcar Ladies go on and oblige an eager listener

Sensation and smothered laughter from the other berths

MRS ROBERTS after a space of terrified silence in a loud whisper to
her AUNT What horrid things But now we really must go to bed It
_was_ too bad to keep talking Id no idea my voice was getting so loud
Which berth will you have aunty Id better take the upper one
because

AUNT MARY whispering No no I must take that so that you can be
with the baby below

MRS ROBERTS Oh how good you are Aunt Mary Its too bad it is
really I cant let you

AUNT MARY Well then you must thats all You know how that child
tosses and kicks about in the night You never can tell where his heads
going to be in the morning but youll probably find it at the foot of
the bed I couldnt sleep an instant my dear if I thought that boy was
in the upper berth for Id be sure of his tumbling out over you Here
let me lay him down She lays the baby in the lower berth There Now
get in Agnesdo and leave me to my struggle with the attraction of
gravitation

MRS ROBERTS Oh _poor_ aunty how will you ever manage it I _must_
help you up

AUNT MARY No my dear dont be foolish But you may go and call the
porter if you like I dare say hes used to it

MRS ROBERTS goes and speak timidly to THE PORTER who fails at first to
understand then smiles broadly accepts a quarter with a duck of his
head and comes forward to AUNT MARYS side

MRS ROBERTS Had he better give you his hand to rest your foot in
while you spring up as if you were mounting horseback

AUNT MARY with disdain _Spring_ My dear I havent sprung for a
quarter of a century I shall require every fibre in the mans body His
hand indeed You get in first Agnes

MRS ROBERTS I will aunty dear but

AUNT MARY sternly Agnes do as I say MRS ROBERTS crouches down on
the lower berth I dont choose that any member of my family shall
witness my contortions Dont you look

MRS ROBERTS No no aunty

AUNT MARY Now porter are you strong

PORTER I used to be porter at a Saratoga hotel and carried up de
ladies trunks dere

AUNT MARY Then youll do I think Now then your knee now your
back There And very handsomely done Thanks

MRS ROBERTS Are you really in Aunt Mary

AUNT MARY dryly Yes Goodnight

MRS ROBERTS Goodnight aunty After a pause of some minutes
Aunty

AUNT MARY Well what

MRS ROBERTS Do you think its perfectly safe

She rises in her berth and looks up over the edge of the upper

AUNT MARY I suppose so Its a wellmanaged road Theyve got the air
brake Ive heard and the Miller platform and all those horrid things
What makes you introduce such unpleasant subjects

MRS ROBERTS Oh I dont mean accidents But you know when you turn
it does creak so awfully I shouldnt mind myself but the baby

AUNT MARY Why child do you think Im going to break through I
couldnt Im one of the _lightest_ sleepers in the world

MRS ROBERTS Yes I know youre a light sleeper butbut it doesnt
seem quite the same thing somehow

AUNT MARY But it is its quite the same thing and you can be
perfectly easy in your mind my dear I should be quite as loth to break
through as you would to have me Goodnight

MRS ROBERTS Yes goodnight Aunty

AUNT MARY Well

MRS ROBERTS You ought to just see him how hes lying Hes a perfect
log _Couldnt_ you just bend over and peep down at him a moment

AUNT MARY Bend over It would be the death of me Goodnight

MRS ROBERTS Goodnight Did you put the glass into my bag or yours I
feel so very thirsty and I want to go and get some water Im sure I
dont know why I should be thirsty Are you Aunt Mary Ah here it is
Dont disturb yourself aunty Ive found it It was in my bag just
where Id put it myself But all this trouble about Willis has made me
so fidgety that I dont know where anything is And now I dont know how
to manage about the baby while I go after the water Hes sleeping
soundly enough now but if he should happen to get into one of his
rolling moods he might tumble out on to the floor Never mind aunty
Ive thought of something Ill just barricade him with these bags and
shawls Now old fellow roll as much as you like If you should happen
to hear him stir aunty wont youaunty Oh dear shes asleep
already and what shall I do While MRS ROBERTS continues talking
various notes of protest profane and otherwise make themselves heard
from different berths I know Ill make a bold dash for the water
and be back in an instant baby Now dont you move you little rogue
She runs to the watertank at the end of the car and then back to her
berth Now baby heres mamma again Are you all right mammas own

A shaggy head and bearded face are thrust from the curtains of the next
berth

THE STRANGER Look here maam I dont want to be disagreeable about
this thing and I hope you wont take any offence but the fact is Im
half dead for want of sleep and if youll only keep quiet now a little
while Ill promise not to speak above my breath if ever I find you on a
sleepingcar after youve come straight through from San Francisco day
and night and not been able to get more than about a quarter of your
usual allowance of restI will indeed

MRS ROBERTS Im very sorry that Ive disturbed you and Ill try to be
more quiet I didnt suppose I was speaking so loud but the cars keep
up such a rattling that you never can tell how loud you _are_ speaking
Did I understand you to say that you were from California

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes maam

MRS ROBERTS San Francisco

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes maam

MRS ROBERTS Thanks Its a terribly long journey isnt it I know
quite how to feel for you Ive a brother myself coming on In fact we
expected him before this She scans his face as sharply as the lamp
light will allow and continues after a brief hesitation Its always
such a silly question to ask a person and I suppose San Francisco is a
large place with a great many people always coming and going so that it
would be only one chance in a thousand if you did

THE CALIFORNIAN patiently Did what maam

MRS ROBERTS Oh I was just wondering if it was possiblebut of course
it isnt and its very flat to askthat youd ever happened to meet my
brother there His name is Willis Campbell

THE CALIFORNIAN with more interest Campbell Campbell Yes I know
a man of that name But I disremember his first name Little low
fellowpretty chunky

MRS ROBERTS I dont know Do you mean short and stout

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes maam

MRS ROBERTS Im sure I cant tell Its a great many years since he
went out there and Ive never seen him in all that time I thought if
you _did_ happen to know himHes a lawyer

THE CALIFORNIAN Its quite likely I know him and in the morning
maam

MRS ROBERTS Oh excuse me Im very sorry to have kept you so long
awake with my silly questions

THE MAN IN THE UPPER BERTH Dont apologize madam Im not a
Californian myself but Im an orphan and away from home and I thank
you on behalf of all our fellowpassengers for the mental refreshment
that your conversation has afforded us _I_ could lie here and listen to
it all night but there are invalids in some of these berths and perhaps
on their account it will be as well to defer everything till the morning
as our friend suggests Allow me to wish you pleasant dreams madam

THE CALIFORNIAN while MRS ROBERTS shrinks back under the curtain of
her berth in dismay and stammers some inaudible excuse slowly emerges
full length from his berth

THE CALIFORNIAN Dont you mind me maam Ive got everything but my
boots and coat on Now then standing beside the berth and looking in
upon the man in the upper tier you do you know that this is a lady
youre talking to

THE UPPER BERTH By your voice and your shaggy personal appearance I
shouldnt have taken you for a ladyno sir But the light is very
imperfect you may be a bearded lady

THE CALIFORNIAN You never mind about my looks The question is Do you
want your head rapped up against the side of this car

THE UPPER BERTH With all the frankness of your own Pacific slope no

MRS ROBERTS hastily reappearing Oh no no dont hurt him Hes
not to blame I was wrong to keep on talking Oh please dont hurt
him

THE CALIFORNIAN to THE UPPER BERTH You hear Well now dont you
speak another word to that lady tonight Just go on maam and free
your mind on any little matter you like I dont want any sleep How
long has your brother been in California

MRS ROBERTS Oh dont lets talk about it now I dont want to talk
about it I thoughtI thoughtGoodnight Oh dear I didnt suppose
I was making so much trouble I didnt mean to disturb anybody I

MRS ROBERTS gives way to the excess of her confusion and mortification
in a little sob and then hides her grief behind the curtains of her
berth THE CALIFORNIAN slowly emerges again from his couch and stands
beside it looking in upon the man in the berth above

THE CALIFORNIAN For half a cent I _would_ rap your head up against that
wall Making the lady cry and getting me so mad I cant sleep Now see
here you just apologize You beg that ladys pardon or Ill have you
out of there before you know yourself Cries of Good Thats right
and Make him show himself hail MRS ROBERTSS champion and heads
more or less dishevelled are thrust from every berth MRS ROBERTS
remains invisible and silent and the loud and somewhat complicated
respiration of her AUNT makes itself heard in the general hush of
expectancy A remark to the effect that The old lady seems to enjoy her
rest achieves a facile applause THE CALIFORNIAN again addresses the
culprit Come now what do you say Ill give you just onehalf a
minute

MRS ROBERTS from her shelter Oh please _please_ dont make him say
anything It was very trying in me to keep him awake and I know he
didnt mean any offence Oh _do_ let him be

THE CALIFORNIAN You hear that You stay quiet the rest of the time
and if that lady choses to keep us all awake the whole night dont _you_
say a word or Ill settle with you in the morning

Loud and continued applause amidst which THE CALIFORNIAN turns from the
man in the berth before him and restores order by marching along the
aisle of the car in his stocking feet The heads vanish behind the
curtains As the laughter subsides he returns to his berth and after a
stare up and down the tranquillized car he is about to retire

A VOICE Oh dont just bow Speak

A fresh burst of laughter greets this sally THE CALIFORNIAN erects
himself again with an air of baited wrath and then suddenly breaks into
a helpless laugh

THE CALIFORNIAN Gentlemen youre too many for _me_

He gets into his berth and after cries of Good for California
Youre all right William Nye and Youre several ahead yet the
occupants of the different berths gradually relapse into silence and at
last as the car lunges onward through the darkness nothing is heard but
the rhythmical clank of the machinery with now and then a burst of
audible slumber from MRS ROBERTSS aunt MARY




II


At Worcester where the train has made the usual stop THE PORTER with
his lantern on his arm enters the car preceding a gentleman somewhat
anxiously smiling his nervous speech contrasts painfully with the
businesslike impassiveness of THE PORTER who refuses with an air of
incredulity to enter into the confidences which the gentleman seems
reluctant to bestow

MR EDWARD ROBERTS This is the Governor Marcy isnt it

THE PORTER Yes sah

MR ROBERTS Came on from Albany and not from New York

THE PORTER Yes sah it did

MR ROBERTS Ah it must be all right I

THE PORTER Was your wife expecting you to come on board here

MR ROBERTS Well no not exactly She was expecting me to meet her at
Boston But Istruggling to give the situation dignity but failing
and throwing himself with selfconvicted silliness upon THE PORTERS
mercy The fact is I thought I would surprise her by joining her here

THE PORTER refusing to have any mercy Oh How did you expect to find
her

MR ROBERTS WellwellI dont know I didnt consider He looks
down the aisle in despair at the closedrawn curtains of the berths and
up at the dangling hats and bags and bonnets and down at the chaos of
boots of both sexes on the floor I dont know _how_ I expected to find
her

MR ROBERTSS countenance falls and he visibly sinks so low in his own
esteem and an imaginary public opinion that THE PORTER begins to have a
little compassion

THE PORTER Deys so many ladies on board _I_ couldnt find her

MR ROBERTS Oh no no of course not I didnt expect that

THE PORTER Dont like to go routing em all up you know I wouldnt
be allowed to

MR ROBERTS I dont ask it that would be preposterous

THE PORTER What sort of looking lady was she

MR ROBERTS Well I dont know really Not very tall rather slight
blue eyes II dont know what youd call her nose Andstop Oh
yes she had a child with her a little boy Yes

THE PORTER thoughtfully looking down the aisle Dey was three ladies
had children I didnt notice whether dey was boys or girls or _what_
dey was Didnt have anybody with her

MR ROBERTS No no Only the child

THE PORTER Well I dont know what you are going to do sah It wont
be a great while now till morning you know Here comes the conductor
Maybe hell know what to do

MR ROBERTS makes some futile inarticulate attempts to prevent The
PORTER from laying the case before THE CONDUCTOR and then stands
guiltily smiling overwhelmed with the hopeless absurdity of his
position

THE CONDUCTOR entering the car and stopping before THE PORTER and
looking at MR ROBERTS Gentleman want a berth

THE PORTER grinning Well no sah Hes lookin for his wife

THE CONDUCTOR with suspicion Is she aboard this car

MR ROBERTS striving to propitiate THE CONDUCTOR by a dastardly
amiability Oh yes yes Theres no mistake about the carthe
Governor Marcy She telegraphed the name just before you left Albany so
that I could find her at Boston in the morning Ah

THE CONDUCTOR At Boston Sternly Then what are you trying to find
her at Worcester in the middle of the night for

MR ROBERTS WhyIthat is

THE PORTER taking compassion on MR ROBERTSS inability to continue
Says he wanted to surprise her

MR ROBERTS Hayes exactly A little caprice you know

THE CONDUCTOR Well that may all be so MR ROBERTS continues to
smile in agonized helplessness against THE CONDUCTORS injurious tone
which becomes more and more offensively patronizing But _I_ cant do
anything for you Here are all these people asleep in their berths and
I cant go round waking them up because you want to surprise your wife

MR ROBERTS No no of course not I never thought

THE CONDUCTOR My advice to _you_ is to have a berth made up and go to
bed till we get to Boston and surprise your wife by telling her what you
tried to do

MR ROBERTS unable to resent the patronage of this suggestion Well I
dont know but I will

THE CONDUCTOR going out The porter will make up the berth for you

MR ROBERTS to THE PORTER who is about to pull down the upper berth
over a vacant seat Ah ErII dont think Ill trouble you to make
it up its so near morning now Just bring me a pillow and Ill try to
get a nap without lying down

He takes the vacant seat

THE PORTER All right sah

He goes to the end of the car and returns with a pillow

MR ROBERTS Ahporter

THE PORTER Yes sah

MR ROBERTS Of course you didnt notice but you dont think you _did_
notice who was in that berth yonder

He indicates a certain berth

THE PORTER Dats a genleman in dat berth I think sah

MR ROBERTS astutely Theres a bonnet hanging from the hook at the
top Im not sure but it looks like my wifes bonnet

THE PORTER evidently shaken by this reasoning but recovering his
firmness Yes sah But you cant depend upon de ladies to hang deir
bonnets on de right hook Jes likely as not dat ladys took de hook at
de foot of her berth instead o de head Sometimes dey takes both

MR ROBERTS Ah After a pause Porter

THE PORTER Yes sah

MR ROBERTS You wouldnt feel justified in looking

THE PORTER I couldnt sah I couldnt indeed

MR ROBERTS reaching his left hand toward THE PORTERS and pressing a
half dollar into his instantly responsive palm But theres nothing to
prevent _my_ looking if I feel perfectly sure of the bonnet

THE PORTER Nno sah

MR ROBERTS All right

THE PORTER retires to the end of the car and resumes the work of
polishing the passengers boots After an interval of quiet MR ROBERTS
rises and looking about him with what he feels to be melodramatic
stealth approaches the suspected berth He unloops the curtain with a
trembling hand and peers ineffectually in he advances his head further
and further into the darkened recess and then suddenly dodges back
again with THE CALIFORNIAN hanging to his neckcloth with one hand

THE CALIFORNIAN savagely What do you want

MR ROBERTS struggling and breathless III want my wife

THE CALIFORNIAN Want your wife Have _I_ got your wife

MR ROBERTS Noahthat isah excuse meI thought you _were_ my
wife

THE CALIFORNIAN getting out of the berth but at the same time keeping
hold of MR ROBERTS Thought I was your _wife_ Do I look like your
wife You cant play that on me old man Porter conductor

MR ROBERTS agonized Oh I beseech you my dear sir dontdont I
can explain itI can indeed I know it has an ugly look but if you
will allow me two wordsonly two words

MRS ROBERTS suddenly parting the curtain of her berth and springing
out into the aisle with her hair wildly dishevelled Edward

MR ROBERTS Oh Agnes explain to this gentleman Imploringly Dont
you know me

A VOICE Make him show you the strawberry mark on his left arm

MRS ROBERTS Edward Edward THE CALIFORNIAN mechanically looses his
grip and they fly into each others embrace Where did you come from

A VOICE Centre door left hand one back

THE CONDUCTOR returning with his lantern Hallo Whats the matter
here

A VOICE Train robbers Throw up your hands Tell the
expressmessenger to bring his safe

The passengers emerge from their berths in various deshabille and
bewilderment

THE CONDUCTOR to MR ROBERTS Have you been making all this row
waking up my passengers

THE CALIFORNIAN No sir he hasnt Ive been making this row This
gentleman was peaceably looking for his wife and I misunderstood him
You want to say anything to me

THE CONDUCTOR silently taking THE CALIFORNIANS measure with his eye as
he stands six fret in his stockings If I did Id get the biggest
brakeman I could find to do it for me _Ive_ got nothing to say except
that I think youd better all go back to bed again

He goes out and the passengers disappear one by one leaving the
ROBERTSES and THE CALIFORNIAN alone

THE CALIFORNIAN to MR ROBERTS Stranger Im sorry I got you into
this scrape

MR ROBERTS Oh dont speak of it my dear sir Im sure we owe you
all sorts of apologies which I shall be most happy to offer you at my
house in Boston with every needful explanation He takes out his card
and gives it to THE CALIFORNIAN who looks at it and then looks at MR
ROBERTS curiously Theres my address and Im sure we shall both be
glad to have you call

MRS ROBERTS Oh yes indeed THE CALIFORNIAN parts the curtains of
his berth to reenter it Goodnight sir and I assure you _we_ shall
do nothing more to disturb youshall we Edward

MR ROBERTS No And now dear I think youd better go back to your
berth

MRS ROBERTS I couldnt sleep and I shall not go back Is this your
place I will just rest my head on your shoulder and we must both be
perfectly quiet Youve no idea what a nuisance I have been making of
myself The whole car was perfectly furious at me one time I kept
talking so loud I dont know how I came to do it but I suppose it was
thinking about you and Willis meeting without knowing each other made me
nervous and I couldnt be still I woke everybody up with my talking
and some of them were quite outrageous in their remarks but I didnt
blame them the least bit for I should have been just as bad That
California gentleman was perfectly splendid though I can tell you _he_
made them stop We struck up quite a friendship I told him I had a
brother coming on from California and hes going to try to think whether
he knows Willis Groans and inarticulate protests make themselves heard
from different berths I declare Ive got to talking again There
now I _shall_ stop and they wont hear another squeak from me the rest
of the night She lifts her head from her husbands shoulder I
wonder if baby will roll out He _does_ kick so And I just sprang up
and left him when I heard your voice without putting anything to keep
him in I _must_ go and have a look at him or I never can settle down
No no dont you go Edward youll be prying into all the wrong berths
in the car you poor thing You stay here and Ill be back in half a
second I wonder which is my berth Ah thats it I know the one now
She makes a sudden dash at a berth and pulling open the curtains is
confronted by the bearded visage of THE CALIFORNIAN Ah Ow ow
Edward Ah II beg your pardon sir excuse me I didnt know it was
you I came for my baby

THE CALIFORNIAN solemnly I havent got any baby maam

MRS ROBERTS NonoI thought you were my baby

THE CALIFORNIAN Perhaps I am maam Ive lost so much sleep I could
cry anyway Do I _look_ like your baby

MRS ROBERTS No no you dont In distress that overcomes her
mortification Oh where is my baby I left him all uncovered and
hell take his death of cold even if he doesnt roll out Oh Edward
Edward help me to find baby

MR ROBERTS bustling aimlessly about Yes yes certainly my dear
But dont be alarmed we shall find him

THE CALIFORNIAN getting out in his stocking feet We shall find him
maam if we have to search every berth in this car Dont you take on
That babys going to be found if hes aboard the train now you bet He
looks about and then tears open the curtains of a berth at random That
your baby maam

MRS ROBERTS flying upon the infant thus exposed Oh _baby_ baby
baby I thought I had lost you Um um um

She clasps him in her arms and covers his face and neck with kisses

THE CALIFORNIAN as he gets back into his berth sotto voce I wish I
_had_ been her baby

MRS ROBERTS returning with her husband to his seat and bringing the
baby with her There Did you ever see such a sleeper Edward In
her ecstasy she abandons all control of her voice and joyfully
exclaims He has slept all through this excitement without a wink

A solemn Voice from one of the berths I envy him

A laugh follows in which all the passengers join

MRS ROBERTS in a hoarse whisper breaking a little with laughter Oh
my goodness there I went again But how funny I assure you Edward
that if their remarks had not been about me I could have really quite
enjoyed some of them I wish there had been somebody here to take them
down And I hope I shall see some of the speakers in the morning
beforeEdward Ive got an idea

MR ROBERTS endeavoring to teach his wife by example to lower her voice
which has risen again Whatwhat is it my dear

MRS ROBERTS Why dont you see How perfectly ridiculous it was of me
not to think of it before though I did think of it once and hadnt the
courage to insist upon it But of course it is and it accounts for his
being so polite and kind to me through all and its the only thing that
can Yes yes it must be

MR ROBERTS mystified What

MRS ROBERTS Willis

MR ROBERTS Who

MRS ROBERTS This Californian

MR ROBERTS Oh

MRS ROBERTS No _stranger_ could have been so patient
andandattentive and I know that he recognized me from the first and
hes just kept it up for a joke so as to surprise us and have a good
laugh at us when we get to Boston Of _course_ its Willis

MR ROBERTS doubtfully Do you think so my dear

MRS ROBERTS I _know_ it Didnt you notice how he looked at your
card And I want you to go at once and speak to him and turn the tables
on him

MR ROBERTS IId rather _not_ my dear

MRS ROBERTS Why Edward what can you mean

MR ROBERTS Hes very violent Suppose it _shouldnt_ be Willis

MRS ROBERTS Nonsense It _is_ Willis Come lets both go and just
tax him with it He cant deny it after all hes done for me She
pulls her reluctant husband toward THE CALIFORNIANS berth and they each
draw a curtain Willis

THE CALIFORNIAN with plaintive endurance Well maam

MRS ROBERTS triumphantly There I knew it was you all along How
could you play such a joke on me

THE CALIFORNIAN I didnt know thered been any joke but I suppose
there must have been if you say so Who am I now maamyour husband
or your baby or your husbands wife or

MRS ROBERTS How funny you are You _know_ youre Willis Campbell my
only brother Now _dont_ try to keep it up any longer Willis

Voices from various berths Give us a rest Willis Jokes too
thin Willis Youre played out Willis Own up old fellowown
up

THE CALIFORNIAN issuing from his berth and walking up and down the
aisle as before till quiet is restored I havent got any sister and
my name aint Willis and it aint Campbell Im very sorry because Id
like to oblige you any way I could

MRS ROBERTS in deep mortification Its I who ought to apologize and
I do most humbly I dont know what to say but when I got to thinking
about it and how kind you had been to me and how sweet you had been
under all myinterruptions I felt perfectly sure that you couldnt be a
mere stranger and then the idea struck me that you must be my brother in
disguise and I was so certain of it that I couldnt help just letting
you know that wed found you out and

MR ROBERTS offering a belated and feeble moral support Yes

MRS ROBERTS promptly turning upon him And _you_ ought to have kept
me from making such a simpleton of myself Edward

THE CALIFORNIAN soothingly Well maam that aint always so easy A
man may mean well and yet not be able to carry out his intentions But
its all right And I reckon wed better try to quiet down again and
get what rest we can

MRS ROBERTS Why yes certainly and I will tryoh I will _try_ not
to disturb you again And if theres anything we can do in reparation
after we reach Boston we shall be so glad to do it

They bow themselves away and return to their seat while THE
CALIFORNIAN reenters his berth




III


The train stops at Framingham and THE PORTER comes in with a passenger
whom he shows to the seat opposite MR and MRS ROBERTS

THE PORTER You can sit here sah Well be in in about an hour now
Hang up your bag for you sah

THE PASSENGER No leave it on the seat here

THE PORTER goes out and the ROBERTSES maintain a dejected silence The
bottom of the bag thrown carelessly on the seat is toward the
ROBERTSES who regard it listlessly

MRS ROBERTS suddenly clutching her husbands arm and hissing in his
ear See She points to the white lettering on the bag where the
name Willis Campbell San Francisco is distinctly legible But it
cant be it must be some other Campbell I cant risk it

MR ROBERTS But theres the name It would be very strange if there
were two people from San Francisco of exactly the same name _I_ will
speak

MRS ROBERTS as wildly as one can in whisper No no I cant let you
Weve made ourselves the laughingstock of the whole car already with our
mistakes and I cant go on I would rather perish than ask him You
dont suppose it _could_ be No it couldnt There may be twenty
Willis Campbells in San Francisco and there probably are Do you think
he looks like me He has a straight nose but you cant tell anything
about the lower part of his face the beard covers it so and I cant
make out the color of his eyes by this light But of course its all
nonsense Still if it _should_ be It would be very stupid of us to
ride all the way from Framingham to Boston with that name staring one in
the eyes I wish he would turn it away If it really turned out to _be_
Willis he would think we were awfully stiff and cold But I cant help
it I _cant_ go attacking every stranger I see and accusing him of
being my brother No no I cant and I _wont_ and thats all about
it She leans forward and addresses the stranger with sudden
sweetness Excuse me sir but I _am_ very much interested by the name
on your bag Not that I think you are even acquainted with him and
there are probably a great many of them there but your coming from the
same city and all _does_ seem a little queer and I hope you wont think
me intrusive in speaking to you because if you _should_ happen by the
thousandth of a chance to be the right one I should be _so_ happy

CAMPBELL The right what madam

MRS ROBERTS The right Willis Campbell

CAMPBELL I hope Im not the wrong one though after a weeks pull on
the railroad its pretty hard for a man to tell which Willis Campbell he
is May I ask if your Willis Campbell had friends in Boston

MRS ROBERTS eagerly He had a sister and a brotherinlaw and a
nephew

CAMPBELL Name of Roberts

MRS ROBERTS Every one

CAMPBELL Then youre

MRS ROBERTS ecstatically Agnes

CAMPBELL And hes

MRS ROBERTS Mr Roberts

CAMPBELL And the babys

MRS ROBERTS Asleep

CAMPBELL Then _I_ am the right one

MRS ROBERTS Oh Willis Willis Willis To think of our meeting in
this way She kisses and embraces him while MR ROBERTS shakes one of
his hands which he finds disengaged _How_ in the world did it happen

CAMPBELL Ah I found myself a little ahead of time and I stopped off
with an old friend of mine at Framingham I didnt want to disappoint you
when you came to meet this train or get you up last night at midnight

MRS ROBERTS And I was in Albany and Ive been moving heaven and earth
to get home before you arrived and Edward came aboard at Worcester to
surprise me andOh youve never seen the baby Ill run right and get
him this instant just as he is and bring him Edward you be
explaining to WillisOh my goodness Looking wildly about I dont
remember the berth and I shall be sure to wake up that poor California
gentleman again _What_ shall I do

CAMPBELL What California gentleman

MRS ROBERTS Oh somebody weve been stirring up the whole blessed
night First I took him for baby and then Edward took him for me and
then I took him for baby again and then we both took him for you

CAMPBELL Did he look like any of us

MRS ROBERTS Like _us_ Hes eight feet tall if hes an inch in his
stockingsand hes always in themand he has a long black beard and
mustaches and hes very lanky and stoops over a good deal but hes
just as lovely as he can be and live and hes been as kind and patient
as twenty Jobs

CAMPBELL Speaks in a sort of soft slow grind

MRS ROBERTS Yes

CAMPBELL Gentle and deferential to ladies

MRS ROBERTS As pie

CAMPBELL Its Tom Goodall Ill have him out of there in half a
second I want you to take him home with you Agnes Hes the best
fellow in the world _Which_ is his berth

MRS ROBERTS Dont ask me Willis But if youd go for baby youll be
sure to find him

MR ROBERTS timidly indicating a berth I think thats the one

CAMPBELL plunging at it and pulling the curtains open You old Tom
Goodall

THE CALIFORNIAN appearing I aint any Tom Goodall My names Abram
Sawyer

CAMPBELL falling back Well sir youre right Im awfully sorry to
disturb you but from my sisters description here I felt certain you
must be my old friend Tom Goodall

THE CALIFORNIAN I aint surprised at it Im only surprised I _aint_
Tom Goodall Ive been a baby twice and Ive been a mans wife once
and once Ive been a longlost brother

CAMPBELL laughing Oh theyve found _him_ _Im_ the longlost
brother

THE CALIFORNIAN sleepily Has she found the other one

CAMPBELL Yes all right I believe

THE CALIFORNIAN Has _he_ found what _he_ wanted

CAMPBELL Yes were all together here THE CALIFORNIAN makes a
movement to get into bed again Oh dont Youd better make a night
of it now Its almost morning anyway We want you to go home with us
and Mrs Roberts will give you a bed at her house and let you sleep a
week

THE CALIFORNIAN Well I reckon youre right stranger I seem to be in
the hands of Providence tonight anyhow He pulls on his boots and coat
and takes his seat beside CAMPBELL I reckon there aint any use in
fighting against Providence

MRS ROBERTS briskly as if she had often tried it and failed Oh not
the least in the world Im sure it was all intended and if you had
turned out to be Willis at last I should be _certain_ of it What
surprises me is that you shouldnt turn out to be anybody after all

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes it is kind of curious But I couldnt help it I
did my best

MRS ROBERTS Oh dont speak of it _We_ are the ones who ought to
apologize But if you only had been somebody it would have been such a
good joke We could always have had such a laugh over it dont you see

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes maam it would have been funny But I hope
youve enjoyed it as it is

MRS ROBERTS Oh very much thanks to you Only I cant seem to get
reconciled to your not being anybody after all You _must_ at least be
some one weve heard about dont you think Its so strange that you
and Willis never even met Dont you think you have some acquaintances
in common

CAMPBELL Look here Agnes do you always shout at the top of your voice
in this way when you converse in a sleepingcar

MRS ROBERTS Was I talking loud again Well you cant help it if you
want to make people hear you

CAMPBELL But there must be a lot of them who dont want to hear you I
wonder that the passengers who are not bloodrelations dont throw things
at youboots and handbags and language

MRS ROBERTS Why thats what theyve _been_ doinglanguage at
leastand Im only surprised theyre not doing it now

THE CALIFORNIAN rising Theyd better not maam

He patrols the car from end to end and quells some rising murmurs
halting at the rebellious berths as he passes

MRS ROBERTS enraptured by his companionship Oh he _must_ be some
connection She glances through the window I do believe that was
Newton or Newtonville or West Newton or Newton Centre I must run and
wake up baby and get him dressed I shant want to wait an instant
after we get in Why were slowing up Why I do believe were there
Edward were there Only fancy being there already

MR ROBERTS Yes my dear Only were not quite there yet Hadnt we
better call your aunt Mary

MRS ROBERTS Id forgotten her

CAMPBELL Is Aunt Mary with you

MRS ROBERTS To be sure she is Didnt I tell you She came on
expressly to meet you

CAMPBELL starting up impetuously Which berth is she in

MRS ROBERTS Right over baby

CAMPBELL And which berth is baby in

MRS ROBERTS distractedly Why thats just what I cant _tell_ It
was bad enough when they were all filled up but now since the people
have begun to come out of them and some of them are made into seats I
cant tell

THE CALIFORNIAN Ill look for you maam I should like to wake up all
the wrong passengers on this car Id take a pleasure in it If you
could make sure of any berth that _aint_ the one Ill begin on that

MRS ROBERTS I cant even be sure of the wrong one No no you
mustntTHE CALIFORNIAN moves away and pauses in front of one of the
berths looking back inquiringly at MRS ROBERTS Oh dont ask _me_
_I_ cant tell To CAMPBELL _Isnt_ he amusing So like all those
Californians that one reads ofso chivalrous and _so_ humorous

AUNT MARY thrusting her head from the curtains of the berth before which
THE CALIFORNIAN is standing Go along with you What do you want

THE CALIFORNIAN Aunt Mary

AUNT MARY Go away Aunt Mary indeed

MRS ROBERTS running toward her followed by CAMPBELL and MR ROBERTS
Why Aunt Mary it _is_ you And heres Willis and heres Edward

AUNT MARY Nonsense How did they get aboard

MRS ROBERTS Edward came on at Worcester and Willis at Framingham to
surprise me

AUNT MARY And a very silly performance Let them wait till Im
dressed and then Ill talk to them Send for the porter She
withdraws her head behind the curtain and then thrusts it out again
And who pray may _this_ be

She indicates THE CALIFORNIAN

MRS ROBERTS Oh a friend of ours from California whos been so kind
to us all night and whos going home with us

AUNT MARY Another ridiculous surprise I suppose But he shall not
surprise _me_ Young man isnt your name Sawyer

THE CALIFORNIAN Yes maam

AUNT MARY Abram

THE CALIFORNIAN Abram Sawyer Youre right there maam

MRS ROBERTS Oh oh I knew it I knew that he must be somebody
belonging to us Oh thank you aunty for thinking

AUNT MARY Dont be absurd Agnes Then youre my

A VOICE from one of the berths Lost stepson Found found at last

THE CALIFORNIAN looks vainly round in an endeavor to identify the
speaker and then turns again to AUNT MARY

AUNT MARY Werent your parents from Bath

THE CALIFORNIAN eagerly Both of em maamboth of em

THE VOICE O my prophetic soul my uncle

AUNT MARY Then youre my old friend Kate Harriss daughter

THE CALIFORNIAN I might be her _son_ maam but _my_ mothers name was
Susan Wakeman

AUNT MARY in sharp disgust Call the porter please

She withdraws her head and pulls her curtains together the rest look
blankly at one another

CAMPBELL Another failure and just when we thought we were sure of you
I dont know what we shall do about you Mr Sawyer

THE VOICE Adopt him

CAMPBELL Thats a good idea We will adopt you You shall be our
adoptive

THE VOICE Baby boy

ANOTHER VOICE Wife

A THIRD VOICE Brother

A FOURTH VOICE Early friend

A FIFTH VOICE Kate Harriss daughter

CAMPBELL laying his hand on THE CALIFORNIANS shoulder and breaking
into a laugh Dont mind them They dont mean anything Its just
their way You come home with my sister and spend Christmas and let us
devote the rest of our lives to making your declining years happy

VOICES Good for you Willis Well all come No ceremony
Small and early

CAMPBELL looking round We appear to have fallen in with a party of
drygoods drummers It makes a gentleman feel like an intruder The
train stops he looks out of the window Weve arrived Come Agnes
come Roberts come Mr Sawyerlets be going

They gather up their several wraps and bags and move with great dignity
toward the door

AUNT MARY putting out her head Agnes If you must forget your aunt
at least remember your child

MRS ROBERTS running back in an agony of remorse Oh _baby_ did I
forget you

CAMPBELL Oh _aunty_ did she forget you He runs back and extends
his arms to his aunt Let me help you down Aunt Mary

AUNT MARY Nonsense Willis Send the porter

CAMPBELL turning round and confronting THE PORTER He was here upon
instinct Shall he fetch a stepladder

AUNT MARY _He_ will know what to do Go away Willis go away with
that child Agnes If I should happen to fall on youThey retreat the
curtain drops and her voice is heard behind it addressing THE PORTER
Give me your hand now your back now your knee So And very well
done Thanks
