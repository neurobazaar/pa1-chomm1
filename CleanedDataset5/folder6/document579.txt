Memorial



Because I believe that Sidney Lanier was much more than a clever artisan
in rhyme and metre because he will I think take his final rank
with the first princes of American song I am glad to provide
this slight memorial There is sufficient material in his letters
for an extremely interesting biography which could be properly prepared
only by his wife These pages can give but a sketch of his life and work

Sidney Lanier was born at Macon Ga on the third of February 1842
His earliest known ancestor of the name was Jerome Lanier
a Huguenot refugee who was attached to the court of Queen Elizabeth
very likely as a musical composer and whose son Nicholas
was in high favor with James I and Charles I as director of music
painter and political envoy and whose grandson Nicholas
held a similar position in the court of Charles II A portrait
of the elder Nicholas Lanier by his friend Van Dyck was sold
with other pictures belonging to Charles I after his execution
The younger Nicholas was the first Marshal or presiding officer
of the Society of Musicians incorporated at the Restoration
for the improvement of the science and the interest of its professors
and it is remarkable that four others of the name of Lanier
were among the few incorporators one of them John Lanier
very likely father of the Sir John Lanier who fought as MajorGeneral
at the Battle of the Boyne and fell gloriously at Steinkirk
along with the brave Douglas

The American branch of the family originated as early as 1716
with the immigration of Thomas Lanier who settled with other colonists
on a grant of land ten miles square which includes the present city
of Richmond Va One of the family a Thomas Lanier married an aunt
of George Washington The family is somewhat widely scattered
chiefly in the Southern States

The father of our poet was Robert S Lanier a lawyer still living
in Macon Ga His mother was Mary Anderson a Virginian of Scotch descent
from a family that supplied members of the House of Burgesses of Virginia
for many years and in more than one generation and was gifted in poetry
music and oratory

His earliest passion was for music As a child he learned to play
almost without instruction on every kind of instrument he could find
and while yet a boy he played the flute organ piano violin guitar
and banjo especially devoting himself to the flute in deference to
his father who feared for him the powerful fascination of the violin
For it was the violinvoice that above all others commanded his soul
He has related that during his college days it would sometimes so exalt him
in rapture that presently he would sink from his solitary musicworship
into a deep trance thence to awake alone on the floor of his room
sorely shaken in nerve

In after years more than one listener remarked the strange violin effects
which he conquered from the flute His devotion to music
rather alarmed than pleased his friends and while it was here
that he first discovered that he possessed decided genius
he for some time shared the early notion of his parents
that it was an unworthy pursuit and he rather repressed his taste
He did not then know by what inheritance it had come to him
nor how worthy is the art

At the age of fourteen he entered the sophomore class of Oglethorpe College
an institution under Presbyterian control near Midway Ga
which had not vitality enough to survive the war He graduated in 1860
at the age of eighteen with the first honors of his class
having lost a year during which he took a clerkship in the Macon postoffice
At least one genuine impulse was received in this college life
and that proceeded from Professor James Woodrow who was then
one of Sidneys teachers and who has since been connected with
the University and Theological Seminary in Columbia S C
During the last weeks of his life Mr Lanier stated
that he owed to Professor Woodrow the strongest and most valuable stimulus
of his youth Immediately on his graduation he was called to a tutorship
in the college which position he held until the outbreak of the war

And here with some hesitation I record as a true biography requires
the development of his consciousness of possessing real genius
One with this gift has a right to know it just as others know if they possess
talent or shiftiness of resource While we do not talk so much of genius now
as we did a generation ago we can yet recognize the difference between
the fervor of that divine birth and the cantering of the livery Pegasus
forth and back along the vulgar boulevards over which facile talent
rides his daily hack Only once or twice in his own private notebook
or in a letter to his wife when it was needful in sickness and loneliness
to strengthen her will and his by testifying his own deepest consciousness
of power did he whisper the assurance of his strength
But he knew it and she knew it and it gave his will a peace in toil
a sunlit peace notwithstanding sickness or want or misapprehension
calm above the zone of clouds

As I have said his genius he first fully discovered in music
I copy from his pencilled college notebook what cannot have been written
after he was eighteen years old The boy had been discussing
the question with himself how far his inclinations were to be regarded
as indicating his best capacities and his duties He says


The point which I wish to settle is merely by what method shall I ascertain
what I am fit for as preliminary to ascertaining Gods will
with reference to me or what my inclinations are as preliminary
to ascertaining what my capacities are that is what I am fit for
I am more than all perplexed by this fact that the prime inclination
that is natural bent which I have checked though of my nature is to music
and for that I have the greatest talent indeed not boasting
for God gave it me I have an extraordinary musical talent
and feel it within me plainly that I could rise as high as any composer
But I cannot bring myself to believe that I was intended for a musician
because it seems so small a business in comparison with other things which
it seems to me I might do Question here What is the province of music
in the economy of the world


Similar aspirations he felt at this early age probably eighteen
for grand literary labor as the same notebook would bear witness
We see here the boy talking to himself a boy who had found in himself
a standard above anything in his fellows

The breaking out of the war summoned Sidney Lanier from books to arms
In April 1861 he enlisted in the Confederate Army
with the Macon Volunteers of the Second Georgia Battalion
the first military organization which left Georgia for Virginia
From his childhood he had had a military taste Even as a small boy
he had raised a company of boys armed with bows and arrows
and so well did he drill them that an honored place was granted them
in the military parades of their elders Having volunteered as a private
at the age of nineteen he remained a private till the last year of the war
Three times he was offered promotion and refused it because
it would separate him from his younger brother who was his companion in arms
as their singularly tender devotion would not allow them to be parted
The first year of service in Virginia was easy and pleasant
and he spent his abundant leisure in music and the study of German
French and Spanish He was in the battles of Seven Pines
Drewrys Bluffs and the seven days fighting about Richmond
culminating in the terrible struggle of Malvern Hill After this campaign
he was transferred with his brother to the signal service
the joke among his less fortunate companions being that he was selected
because he could play the flute His headquarters were now
for a short period at Petersburg where he had the advantage
of a small local library but where he began to feel the premonitions
of that fatal disease consumption against which he battled
for fifteen years The regular full inspirations required by the flute
probably prolonged his life In 1863 his detachment was mounted
and did service in Virginia and North Carolina At last the two brothers
were separated it coming in the duty of each to take charge of a vessel
which was to run the blockade Sidneys vessel was captured
and he was for five months in Point Lookout prison until he was exchanged
with his flute for he never lost it near the close of the war
Those were very hard days for him and a picture of them is given
in his Tiger Lilies the novel which he wrote two years afterward
It is a luxuriant unpruned work written in haste for the press
within the space of three weeks but one which gave rich promise of the poet
A chapter in the middle of the book introducing the scenes
of those four years of struggle is wholly devoted to a remarkable metaphor
which becomes an allegory and a sermon in which war is pictured
as a strange enormous terrible flower which the early spring of 1861
brought to bloom besides innumerable violets and jessamines
He tells how the plant is grown what arguments the horticulturists give
for cultivating it how Christ inveighed against it
and how its shades are damp and its odors unhealthy
and what a fine specimen was grown the other day in North America
by two wealthy landed proprietors who combined all their resources
of money of blood of bones of tears of sulphur and what not
to make this the grandest specimen of modern horticulture
It is supposed by some says he that seed of this American specimen
now dead yet remains in the land but as for this author
who with many friends suffered from the unhealthy odors of the plant
he could find it in his heart to wish fervently that this seed
if there be verily any might perish in the germ utterly out of sight
and life and memory and out of the remote hope of resurrection
forever and ever no matter in whose granary they are cherished
Through those four years though earnestly devoted to the cause
and fulfilling his duties with zeal his horror of war grew to the end
He had entered it in a crack regiment with a dandy uniform
and was first encamped near Norfolk where the gardens
with the Northern market hopelessly cut off were given freely
to the soldiers who lived in every luxury and every man had his sweetheart
in Norfolk But the tyranny and Christlessness of war oppressed him
though he loved the free life in the saddle and under the stars

In February 1865 he was released from Point Lookout
and undertook the weary return on foot to his home in Georgia
with the twentydollar gold piece which he had in his pocket when captured
and which was returned to him with his other little effects when he
was released Of course he had the flute which he had hidden in his sleeve
when he entered the prison and which had earned him some comforts
He reached home March 15th with his strength utterly exhausted
There followed six weeks of desperate illness and just as he began
to recover from it his beloved mother died of consumption
He himself arose from his sickbed with pronounced congestion of one lung
but found relief in two months of outofdoor life with an uncle
at Point Clear Mobile Bay From December 1865 to April 1867
he filled a clerkship in Montgomery Ala and in the next month
made his first visit to New York on the business of publishing
his Tiger Lilies written in April In September 1867 he took charge
of a country academy of nearly a hundred pupils in Prattville Ala
and was married in December of the same year to Miss Mary Day
daughter of Charles Day of Macon

To the years before Mr Laniers marriage belong a dozen poems
included in this volume Two of them are translations from the German
made during the war the others are songs and miscellaneous poems
full of flush and force but not yet moulded by those laws of art
of whose authority he had hardly become conscious His access to books
was limited and he expressed himself more with music than with literature
taking down the notes of birds and writing music to his own songs
or those of Tennyson

In January 1868 the next month after his marriage
he suffered his first hemorrhage from the lungs and returned in May to Macon
in very low health Here he remained studying and afterward practising law
with his father until December 1872 During this period there came
in the spring and summer of 1870 a more alarming decline with settled cough
He went for treatment to New York where he remained two months
returning in October greatly improved and strong in hope
but again at home he lost ground steadily He was now fairly engaged
in the brave struggle against consumption which could have but one end
So precarious already was his health that a change of residence
was determined on and in December 1872 he went to San Antonio Texas
in search of a permanent home there leaving his wife and children meanwhile
at Macon But the climate did not prove favorable and he returned
in April 1873

During these five years a sense of holy obligation based on the conviction
that special talents had been given him and that the time might be short
rested upon Lanier until it was impossible to resist it longer
He felt himself called to something other than a country attorneys practice
It was the compulsion of waiting utterance not yet enfranchised
From Texas he wrote to his wife


Were it not for some circumstances which make such a proposition
seem absurd in the highest degree I would think that I am shortly to die
and that my spirit hath been singing its swansong before dissolution
All day my soul hath been cutting swiftly into the great space of the subtle
unspeakable deep driven by wind after wind of heavenly melody
The very inner spirit and essence of all windsongs birdsongs
passionsongs folksongs countrysongs sexsongs soulsongs and bodysongs
hath blown upon me in quick gusts like the breath of passion
and sailed me into a sea of vast dreams whereof each wave is at once
a vision and a melody


Now fully determined to give himself to music and literature so long
as he could keep death at bay he sought a land of books Taking his flute
and his pen for sword and staff he turned his face northward
After visiting New York he made his home in Baltimore December 1873
under engagement as first flute for the Peabody Symphony Concerts

With his settlement in Baltimore begins a story of as brave and sad a struggle
as the history of genius records On the one hand was the opportunity
for study and the full consciousness of power and a will never subdued
and on the other a body wasting with consumption that must be forced
to task beyond its strength not merely to express the thoughts of beauty
which strove for utterance but from the necessity of providing bread
for his babes His father would have had him return to Macon
and settle down with him in business and share his income
but that would have been the suicide of every duty and ambition
So he wrote from Baltimore to his father November 29 1873


I have given your last letter the fullest and most careful consideration
After doing so I feel sure that Macon is not the place for me
If you could taste the delicious crystalline air and the champagne breeze
that Ive just been rushing about in I am equally sure
that in point of climate you would agree with me that my chance for life
is ten times as great here as in Macon Then as to business why should I
nay how CAN I settle myself down to be a thirdrate struggling lawyer
for the balance of my little life as long as there is a certainty
almost absolute that I can do some other thing so much better
Several persons from whose judgment in such matters there can be no appeal
have told me for instance that I am the greatest fluteplayer in the world
and several others of equally authoritative judgment
have given me an almost equal encouragement to work with my pen
Of course I protest against the necessity which makes me write
such things about myself I only do so because I so appreciate
the love and tenderness which prompt you to desire me with you
that I will make the fullest explanation possible of my course
out of reciprocal honor and respect for the motives which lead you
to think differently from me My dear father think how for twenty years
through poverty through pain through weariness through sickness
through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college and of a bare army
and then of an exacting business life through all the discouragement
of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways 
I say think how in spite of all these depressing circumstances
and of a thousand more which I could enumerate these two figures
of music and of poetry have steadily kept in my heart
so that I could not banish them Does it not seem to you as to me
that I begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees
of these two sublime arts after having followed them so long and so humbly
and through so much bitterness


What could his father do but yield And what could he do
during the following years of his sons fight for standingroom on the planet
but help But for that help generously given by his father and brother
as their ability allowed at the critical times of utter prostration
the end would not have been long delayed For the little
that was necessary to give his household a humble support
it was not easy for the most strenuous young author to win by his pen
in the intervals between his hemorrhages He asked for very little
only the supply of absolute necessities what it would be easy
for a well man to earn but what it was very hard for a man to earn
scarce able to leave his bed dependent on the chance income had
from poems and articles in magazines that would take them or from courses
of lectures in schools Often for months together he could do no work
He was driven to Texas to Florida to Pennsylvania to North Carolina
to try to recover health from pine breaths and clover blossoms
Supported by the implicit faith of one heart which fully believed
in his genius and was willing to wait if he could only find his opportunity
his courage never failed He still kept before himself first his ideal
and his mission and he longed to live that he might accomplish them
It must have been in such a mood that soon after coming to Baltimore
he wrote to his wife who was detained in the South


So many great ideas for Art are born to me each day I am swept away
into the land of AllDelight by their strenuous sweet whirlwind
and I find within myself such entire yet humble confidence
of possessing every single element of power to carry them all out
save the little paltry sum of money that would suffice to keep us
clothed and fed in the meantime

I do not understand this


Laniers was an unknown name and he would write only in obedience
to his own sense of art and he did not fit his wares
to the taste of those who buy verse It was to comfort his wife
in this period of greatest uncertainty whether he had not erred
in launching in the sea of literature that he wrote again
a letter of frankest confession


I will make to thee a little confession of faith telling thee
my dearer self in words what I do not say to my notsodearself
except in more modest feeling

Know then that disappointments were inevitable and will still come
until I have fought the battle which every great artist has had to fight
since time began This  dimly felt while I was doubtful
of my own vocation and powers  is clear as the sun to me now that I KNOW
through the fiercest tests of life that I am in soul and shall be
in life and utterance a great poet

The philosophy of my disappointments is that there is so much CLEVERNESS
standing betwixt me and the public    Richard Wagner is
sixty years old and over and onehalf of the most cultivated artists
of the most cultivated artland quoad music still think him an absurdity
Says Schumann in one of his letters The publishers will not listen to me
for a moment and dost thou not remember Schubert and Richter
and John Keats and a sweet host more

Now this is written because I sit here in my room daily
and picture THEE picturing ME worn and troubled or disheartened
and because I do not wish thee to think up any groundless sorrow in thy soul
Of course I have my keen sorrows momentarily more keen than I would like
any one to know but I thank God that in a knowledge of Him and of myself
which cometh to me daily in fresh revelations I have a steadfast
firmament of blue in which all clouds soon dissolve
I have wanted to say this several times of late but it is not easy
to bring ones self to talk so of ones self even to ones dearer self

Have then    no fears nor anxieties in my behalf
look upon all my disappointments as mere witnesses that art has no enemy
so unrelenting as cleverness and as rough weather that seasons timber
It is of little consequence whether I fail the I in the matter
is a small business Que mon nom soit fletri que la France soit libre
quoth Danton which is to say interpreted by my environment
Let my name perish  the poetry is good poetry and the music is good music
and beauty dieth not and the heart that needs it will find it


Having now given sacredly to art what vital forces his will could command
he devoted himself with an intense energy to the study
of English literature making himself a master of AngloSaxon
and early English texts and pursuing the study down to our own times
He read freely also and with a scholars nice eagerness
in further fields of study but all with a view to gathering the stores
which a full man might draw from in the practice of poetic art
for he had that large compass which sees and seeks truths
in various excursions and no field of history or philology or philosophy
or science found him unsympathetic The opportunity for these studies
opened a new era in his development while we begin to find
a crystallization of that theory of formal verse which he adopted
and a growing power to master it To this artistic side of poetry he gave
from this time very special study until he had formulated it
in his lectures in the Johns Hopkins University and in his volume
The Science of English Verse

But from this time the struggle against his fatal disease
was conscious and constant In May 1874 he visited Florida
under an engagement to write a book for distribution by a railroad company
Two months of the summer were spent with his family at Sunnyside Ga
where Corn was written This poem published in Lippincotts Magazine
was much copied and made him known to many admirers
No one of these was of so much value to him as Bayard Taylor
at whose suggestion he was chosen to write the cantata
for the opening of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia
and with whom he carried on a correspondence so long as Mr Taylor lived
To Mr Taylor he owed introductions of value to other writers
and for his sympathy and aid his letters prove that he felt very grateful
In his first letter to Mr Taylor written August 7 1875 he says


I could never describe to you what a mere drought and famine
my life has been as regards that multitude of matters which I fancy
one absorbs when one is in an atmosphere of art or when one
is in conversational relation with men of letters with travellers
with persons who have either seen or written or done large things
Perhaps you know that with us of the younger generation in the South
since the war pretty much the whole of life has been merely not dying


The selection of Mr Lanier to write the Centennial Cantata
first brought his name into general notice but its publication
in advance of the music by Dudley Buck was the occasion
of an immense amount of ridicule more or less goodhumored It was written
by a musician to go with music under the new relations of poetry to music
brought about by the great modern development of the orchestra
and was not to be judged without its orchestral accompaniment
The criticism it received pained our poet but did not at all affect his faith
in his theories of art To his father he wrote from New York May 8 1876


My experience in the varying judgments given about poetry   
has all converged upon one solitary principle and the experience
of the artist in all ages is reported by history to be of precisely
the same direction That principle is that the artist shall put forth
humbly and lovingly and without bitterness against opposition
the very best and highest that is within him utterly regardless
of contemporary criticism What possible claim can contemporary criticism
set up to respect  that criticism which crucified Jesus Christ
stoned Stephen hooted Paul for a madman tried Luther for a criminal
tortured Galileo bound Columbus in chains drove Dante into a hell of exile
made Shakespeare write the sonnet When in disgrace with fortune
and mens eyes gave Milton five pounds for Paradise Lost
kept Samuel Johnson cooling his heels on Lord Chesterfields doorstep
reviled Shelley as an unclean dog killed Keats cracked jokes on Glueck
Schubert Beethoven Berlioz and Wagner and committed so many other
impious follies and stupidities that a thousand letters like this
could not suffice even to catalogue them


Since first coming to the North in September 1873
Mr Lanier had been separated from his family The two happy months with them
after his visit to Florida was followed by several other briefer visits
The winters of 187475 and 187576 found him still in Baltimore
playing at the Peabody pursuing his studies and writing the Symphony
the Psalm of the West the Cantata and some shorter poems
with a series of prose descriptive articles for Lippincotts Magazine
In the summer of 1876 he called his family to join him at West Chester Pa
This was authorized by an engagement to write the Life of Charlotte Cushman
The work was begun but the engagement was broken two months later
owing to the illness of the friend of the family who was to provide
the material from the mass of private correspondence

Following this disappointment a new cold was incurred
and his health became so much impaired that in November
the physicians told him he could not expect to live longer than May
unless he sought a warmer climate About the middle of December
he started with his wife for the Gulf coast and visited Tampa Fla
gaining considerable benefit from the mild climate In April he ventured
North again tarrying through the spring with his friends in Georgia
and after a summer with his own family in Chadds Ford Pa
a final move was ventured in October to Baltimore as home
Here he resumed his old place in the Peabody orchestra
and continued to play there for three winters

The Old English studies which he had pursued with such deep delight
he now put to use in a course of lectures on Elizabethan Verse
given in a private parlor to a class of thirty ladies
This was followed by a more ambitious Shakespeare Course of lectures
in the smaller hall of the Peabody Institute The undertaking
was immensely cheered on and greatly praised but was a financial failure
It opened the way however to one of the chiefest delights of his life
his appointment as lecturer on English literature for the ensuing year
at the Johns Hopkins University After some correspondence on the subject
with President Gilman he received notice on his birthday 1879
of his appointment with a salary attached it may be mentioned
which gave him the first income assured in any year since his marriage
This stimulated him to new life for he was now barely able to walk
after a severe illness and renewed hemorrhage

The last two years had been more fruitful in verse than any
that had gone before as he had now acquired confidence in his view
of the principles of art In 1875 he had written


In this little song Special Pleading I have begun to dare
to give myself some freedom in my own peculiar style and have allowed myself
to treat words similes and metres with such freedom as I desired
The result convinces me that I can do so now safely


Among his poems of this period may be mentioned A Song of the Future
The Revenge of Hamish and  what are excellent examples of the kind of art
of which he had now gained command  The Song of the Chattahoochee
and A Song of Love It was at this time that he wrote
The Marshes of Glynn his most ambitious poem thus far
and one which he intended to follow with a series of Hymns of the Marshes
which he left incomplete

The summer of 1879 was spent at Rockingham Springs Va
and here in six weeks was begun and finished his volume
Science of English Verse Another severe illness prostrated him
in September but the necessity of work allowed no time for such distractions
In October he opened three lecture courses in young ladies schools
and through the winter notwithstanding a most menacing illness
about January 1st he was in continuous rehearsals and concerts
at the Peabody and besides miscellaneous writings and studies
gave weekly ten lectures upon English literature two of them public
at the University two to University classes and the remaining six
at private schools The University public lectures upon English Verse
more especially Shakespeares in part contained and in part
were introductory to The Science of English Verse

The final consuming fever opened in May 1880 In July he went
with Mrs Lanier and her father to West Chester Pa
where a fourth son was born in August Unable to bear the fall climate
he returned alone early in September to his Baltimore home

This winter brought a handtohand battle for life In December he came
to the very door of death Before February he had essayed the open air
to test himself for his second University lecture course
His improvement ceased on that first day of exposure
Nevertheless by April he had gone through the twelve lectures
there were to have been twenty which were later published
under the title The English Novel A few of the earlier lectures
he penned himself the rest he was obliged to dictate to his wife
With the utmost care of himself going in a closed carriage
and sitting during his lecture his strength was so exhausted
that the struggle for breath in the carriage on his return
seemed each time to threaten the end Those who heard him
listened with a sort of fascinated terror as in doubt
whether the hoarded breath would suffice to the end of the hour

It was in December of this winter when too feeble to raise his food
to his mouth with a fever temperature of 104 degrees
that he pencilled his last and greatest poem Sunrise
one of his projected series of the Hymns of the Marshes
It seemed as if he were in fear that he would die with it unuttered

At the end of April 1881 he made his last visit to New York
to complete arrangements with Charles Scribners Sons
for the publication of other books of the King Arthur series
But in a day or two aggravated illness compelled his wife to join him
and his medical adviser pronounced tentlife in a pure high climate
to be the last hope His brother Clifford was summoned from Alabama
to assist in carrying out the plans for encamping near Asheville NC
whither the brothers went soon after the middle of May
By what seemed a hopeful coincidence he was tendered a commission
to write an account of the region in a railroad interest
as he had done six years before with Florida This provided a monthly salary
which was to be the dependence of himself and family
The materials for this book were collected and the book thoroughly shaped
in the authors mind when July ended but his increasing anguish
kept him from dictating often from all speech for hours
and he carried the plan away with him

A site was chosen on the side of Richmond Hill three miles from Asheville
Clifford returned to Alabama after seeing the tents pitched and floored
and Mrs Lanier came with her infant to take her place as nurse
for the invalid Early in July Mr Lanier the father with his wife
joined them in the encampment As the passing weeks
brought no improvement to the sufferer he started August 4th
on a carriage journey across the mountains with his wife
to test the climate of Lynn Polk County N C There a deadly illness
attacked him No return was possible and Clifford was summoned by telegraph
and assisted his father in removing the encampment to Lynn Deceived by hope
and pressed by business cares Clifford went home August 24th
and the father and his wife five days later expecting to return soon
Mrs Laniers own words as written in the brief annals of his life
furnished me will tell the end


We are left alone August 29th with one another
On the last night of the summer comes a change His love and immortal will
hold off the destroyer of our summer yet one more week
until the forenoon of September 7th and then falls the frost
and that unfaltering will renders its supreme submission
to the adored will of God


So the tragedy ended the manly struggle carried on
with indomitable resolution against illness and want and care
Just when he seemed to have conquered success enough
to assure him a little leisure to write his poems
then his feeble but resolute hold upon earth was exhausted
What he left behind him was written with his lifeblood
High above all the evils of the world he lived in a realm of ideal serenity
as if it were the business of life to conquer difficulties

This is not the place for an essay on the genius of Sidney Lanier
It is enough to call attention to some marked points
in his character and work

He had more than Miltons love for music He sung like a bard
to the accompaniment of a harp He lived in sweet sounds
forever conscious of a ceaseless flow of melody which
if resisted for a while by business occupations would swell again
in its natural current and break at his bidding into audible music

We have the following recognition of his genius from Asger Hamerik
his Director for six years in the Peabody Symphony Orchestra of Baltimore


To him as a child in his cradle Music was given the heavenly gift
to feel and to express himself in tones His human nature
was like an enchanted instrument a magic flute or the lyre of Apollo
needing but a breath or a touch to send its beauty out into the world
It was indeed irresistible that he should turn with those poetical feelings
which transcend language to the penetrating gentleness of the flute
or the infinite passion of the violin for there was an agreement
a spiritual correspondence between his nature and theirs
so that they mutually absorbed and expressed each other
In his hands the flute no longer remained a mere material instrument
but was transformed into a voice that set heavenly harmonies into vibration
Its tones developed colors warmth and a low sweetness of unspeakable poetry
they were not only true and pure but poetic allegoric as it were
suggestive of the depths and heights of being and of the delights
which the earthly ear never hears and the earthly eye never sees
No doubt his firm faith in these lofty idealities gave him the power
to present them to our imaginations and thus by the aid
of the higher language of Music to inspire others with that sense of beauty
in which he constantly dwelt

His conception of music was not reached by an analytic study of note by note
but was intuitive and spontaneous like a womans reason he felt it so
because he felt it so and his delicate perception required
no more logical form of reasoning

His playing appealed alike to the musically learned and to the unlearned 
for he would magnetize the listener but the artist felt in his performance
the superiority of the momentary living inspiration
to all the rules and shifts of mere technical scholarship
His art was not only the art of art but an art above art

I will never forget the impression he made on me when he played
the fluteconcerto of Emil Hartmann at a Peabody symphony concert in 1878
his tall handsome manly presence his flute breathing noble sorrows
noble joys the orchestra softly responding The audience was spellbound
Such distinction such refinement He stood the master the genius


In the one novel which he wrote at the age of twentyfive
he makes one of his characters say


To make a HOME out of a household given the raw materials 
to wit wife children a friend or two and a house 
two other things are necessary These are a good fire and good music
And inasmuch as we can do without the fire for half the year
I may say music is the one essential Late explorers say they have found
some nations that have no God but I have not read of any that had no music
Music means harmony harmony means love love means  God


The theoretical relation between music and poetry would hardly
have attracted his study had it not been that his mind
was as truly philosophically and scientifically accurate
as it was poetically sensuous and imaginative In a letter
to Mr E C Stedman he complained that in all directions
the poetic art was suffering from the shameful circumstance that criticism
was without a scientific basis for even the most elementary of its judgments

Although the work was irksome to him he could not go on
writing at haphazard trusting to his own mere taste to decide what was good
until he had settled for himself scientifically what are the laws
of poetical construction This accounts for his exposition
of the laws of beauty in that unique work The Science of English Verse
which was based on Dantes thought The best conceptions cannot be
save where science and genius are The book is chiefly taken up
with a discussion of rhythm and tonecolor in verse and it is
well within the truth to say that it is the most complete and thorough
original investigation of the formal element in poetry in existence
The rhythm he treated as the marking of definite time measurements
which could be indicated by bars in musical notation
having their regular time and their regular number of notes
with their proper accent To this time measurement Mr Lanier gave
the preeminence which Coleridge and other writers have given to accent
He conceived of a line of poetry as consisting of a definite number
of bars or feet each bar containing in dactylic metre
three equal eighth notes of which the first is accented
or in iambic metre which has the same triple time
of one eighth note and one quarter note with the accent on the second
Thus the accented syllable is not necessarily longer than the unaccented
except as the rhythm happens to make it so This idea is very fully developed
and with great wealth of curious Old English illustrations
Under the designation of tonecolor he treats very suggestively
of rhyme alliteration and vowel and consonant distribution
showing how the recurrence of euphonic vowels and consonants
secures that rich variety of tonecolor which music gives in orchestration
The work thus breaks away from the classic grammarians tables
of trochees and anapaests and discusses the forms of poetry
in the terms of music and of both tonecolor and of rhythm he would say
in the words of old King James the very touchstone whereof is music

Illustrations of these technical beauties of musical rhythm
and vowel and consonant distribution abound in Laniers poetry
Such is the Song of the Chattahoochee which deserves a place
beside Tennysons Brook It strikes a higher key
and is scarcely less musical Such passages are numerous
in his Sunrise on the Marshes as in the lines beginning

 Not slower than majesty moves

or the other lines beginning

 Oh what if a sound should be made

These investigations in the science of verse bore their fruit especially
in the poems written during the last three or four years of his life
when his sense of the solemn sacredness of Art became more profound
and he acquired a greater ease in putting into practice his theory of verse
And this made him thoroughly original He was no imitator
either of Tennyson or of Swinburne though musically he is nearer to them
than to any others of his day We constantly notice in his verse
that dainty effect which the ear loves and which comes
from deft marshalling of consonants and vowels so that they shall add their
suppler and subtler reinforcement to the steady infantry tramp of rhythm
Of this delicate art which is much more than mere alliteration
which is concerned with dominant accented vowels as well as consonants
with the easy flow of liquids and fricatives and with
the progressive opening or closing of the organs of articulation
the laws are not easy to formulate but examples abound in Laniers poems

Mr Stedman poet and critic raises the question whether Laniers
extreme conjunction of the artistic with the poetic temperament
which he says no man has more clearly displayed did not somewhat hamper
and delay his power of adequate expression Possibly
but he was building not for the day but for time He must work out
his laws of poetry even if he had almost to invent its language
for to him was given the power of analysis as well as of construction
and he was too conscientious to do anything else than to find out
what was best and why and then tell and teach it as he had learnt it
even if men said that his late spring was delaying bud and blossom

But it would be a great mistake to find in Lanier only or chiefly
the artist He had the substance of poetry He possessed both elements
as Stedman says in extreme conjunction He overflowed with fancy
His imagination needed to be held in check This was recognized in Corn
and appears more fully in The Symphony the first productions
which gave him wide recognition as a poet Illustrations too much abound
to allow selection

And for the substance of invention there needed in Laniers judgment
large and exact knowledge of the worlds facts A poet must be
a student of things truths and men His own studies were wide
and his scholarship accurate He did not believe that art comes
all by instinct without work In one of his keen criticisms of poets
he said of Edgar A Poe whom he esteemed more highly
than his countrymen are wont to do The trouble with Poe was
he did not KNOW enough He needed to know a good many more things
in order to be a great poet Lanier had a passion for the exact truth
and all of it

The intense sacredness with which Lanier invested Art held him thrall
to the highest ethical ideas To him the most beautiful thing of all
was Right He loved the words the beauty of holiness
and it pleased him to reverse the phrase and call it the holiness of beauty
When one reads Lanier he is reminded of two writers Milton and Ruskin
More than any other great English authors they are dominated by
this beauty of holiness Lanier was saturated with it
It shines out of every line he wrote It is not that he never wrote
a maudlin line but that every thought was lofty That it must be so
was a first postulate of his Art Hear his words to the students
of Johns Hopkins University


Let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination
of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman
yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh
if the brow be insincere if in the minutest particular
the physical beauty suggests a moral ugliness that sculptor 
unless he be portraying a moral ugliness for a moral purpose 
may as well give over his marble for pavingstones
Time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not accept his work
For indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived
how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines
which run back into a common ideal origin and who therefore is not afire
with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty  that he in short
who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing
burn as one fire shine as one light within him he is not yet
the great artist


And he returns to the theme


Can not one say with authority to the young artist whether working
in stone in color in tones or in characterforms of the novel
So far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction
that unless you are suffused  soul and body one might say 
with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love
that is the love of all things in their proper relation
unless you are suffused with this love do not dare to meddle with beauty
unless you are suffused with beauty do not dare to meddle with love
unless you are suffused with truth do not dare to meddle with goodness
in a word unless you are suffused with truth wisdom goodness and love
abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist


Thus was it true as was said of his work by his associate
Dr Wm Hand Browne that one thread of purpose runs through it all
This thread is found in his fervid love for his fellowmen
and his never ceasing endeavors to kindle an enthusiasm
for beauty purity nobility of life which he held it the poets first duty
to teach and to exemplify And so there came into his verse
a solemn worshipful element dominating it everywhere
and giving loftiness to its beauty For he was the democrat whom he described
in contrast to Whitmans mere brawny sixfooted openshirted hero
whose strength was only that of the biceps


My democrat the democrat whom I contemplate with pleasure
the democrat who is to write or to read the poetry of the future
may have a mere thread for his biceps yet he shall be strong enough
to handle hell he shall play ball with the earth
and albeit his stature may be no more than a boys
he shall still be taller than the great redwoods of California
his height shall be the height of great resolution
and love and faith and beauty and knowledge and subtle meditation
his head shall be forever among the stars


This standard he could not forget in his judgments of artists
There was something in Whitman which refreshed him like harsh salt spray
but to Whitmans lawlessness of art he was an utter foe
We find it written down in his notes


Whitman is poetrys butcher Huge raw collops slashed from the rump
of poetry and never mind gristle  is what Whitman feeds our souls with

As near as I can make it out Whitmans argument seems to be that
because a prairie is wide therefore debauchery is admirable
and because the Mississippi is long therefore every American is God


So he says of Swinburne


He invited me to eat the service was silver and gold
but no food therein save pepper and salt


And of William Morris


He caught a crystal cupful of the yellow light of sunset
and persuading himself to dream it wine drank it with a sort of smile


Though not what would be called a religious writer
Laniers large and deep thought took him to the deepest spiritual faiths
and the vastness of Nature drew him to a trust in the Infinite above us
Thus his young search after God and truth brought him
into the membership of the Presbyterian Church while at Oglethorpe College
and though in after years his creed became broader than that
imposed by the Church he had joined on its clergy he could not outgrow
the simple faith and consecration which are all it requires of its membership
His college notebook records his earnestness


Liberty patriotism and civilization are on their knees
before the men of the South and with clasped hands and straining eyes
are begging them to become Christians


How naturally his large faith in God finds expression
in his Marshes of Glynn or his reverent discipleship
of the great Artist and Master in his Ballad of the Trees and the Master
or his The Crystal which was Christ Yet with not a whit less
of worshipfulness and consecration there grew in him a repugnance
to the sectarianism of the Churches which put him somewhat out of sympathy
with their formal organizations He wrote in what may have been
a sketch for a poem


I fled in tears from the mens ungodly quarrel about God
I fled in tears to the woods and laid me down on the earth
Then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground
and I looked and my cheek lay close to a violet Then my heart took courage
and I said

 I know that thou art the word of my God dear Violet
 And Oh the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads
 Measure what space a violet stands above the ground
 Tis no further climbing that my soul and angels have to do than that


It was this quality high and consecrate as of a palmer with his vow
this knightly valiance this constant San Greal quest
after the lofty in character and aim this passion for Good and Love
which fellows him rather with Milton and Ruskin than with
the less sturdily built poets of his day and which puts him
in sharpest contrast with the school led by Swinburne 
with Rossetti and Morris as his followers hard after him 
a school whose reed has a short gamut and plays but two notes Mors and Eros
hopeless death and lawless love But poetry is larger and finer
than they know Its face is toward the worlds future
it does not maunder after the flowerdecked nymphs and yellowskirted fays
that have forever fled  and good riddance  their haunted springs
and tangled thickets It can feed on its growing sweet and fresh faiths
but will draw foul contagion from the rank mists that float
over old and cold fables For all knowledge is food as faith is wine
to a genius like Lanier A poet genius has great common sense
He lives in today and tomorrow not in yesterday
Such men were Shakespeare and Goethe The age of poetry is not past
there is nothing in culture or science hostile to it
Milton was one of the worlds great poets but he was
the most cultured and scholarly and statesmanlike man of his day
He was no dreamer of dead dreams Neither was Lanier a dreamer
He came late to the opportunity he longed for but when he came to it
he was a tremendous student not of music alone but of language
of philosophy and of science He loved science He was an inventor
He had all the instincts and ambitions of this nineteenth century
But that only made his range of poetic thought wider as his outlook
became larger The world is opening to the poet with every question
the crucible asks of the elements with every spectrum
the prism steals from a star The old he has and all the new

All this a man of Laniers breadth understood fully
for he had a large capacity and he sought a full equipment
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of his gifts was their complete symmetry
It is hard to tell what register of perception or sensibility
or wit or will was lacking The constructive and the critical faculties
the imaginative and the practical balanced each other His wit and humor
played upon the soberer background of his more recognized qualities
The artists withdrawn vision was at any need promptly exchanged
for the exercise of that scrupulous exactitude called for in the routine
of the lawoffice or the postoffice clerkship or other business relations
or for the play of those energies exerted in camp or field There
so his comrades testify the most wearing drudgeries of a soldiers life
were always undertaken with notable alacrity and were thoroughly discharged
when he would as invariably return the task being done to the gentle region
of his own high thoughts and the artists realm of beauty

But how short was his day and how slender his opportunity
From the time he was of age he waged a constant courageous hopeless fight
against adverse circumstance for room to live and write
Much very dear and sweet and most sympathetic helpfulness
he met in the city of his adoption and from friends elsewhere
but he could not command the time and leisure which might have
lengthened his life and given him opportunity to write the music and the verse
with which his soul was teeming Yet short as was his literary life
and hindered though it were its fruit will fill a large space
in the garnering of the poetic art of our country

Poems of Sidney Lanier






 
  SUNRISE the culminating poem the highest vision of Sidney Lanier 
  was dedicated through his latest request to that friend 
  who indeed came into his life only near its close 
  yet was at first meeting recognized by the poet 
  as the father of his spirit 
  GEORGE WESTFELDT 
  When words were very few and the poem was unread 
  even by any friend the earnest bidding came 
  Send him my SUNRISE 
  that he may know how entirely we are one in thought 
 






Hymns of the Marshes



 I Sunrise


In my sleep I was fain of their fellowship fain
 Of the liveoak the marsh and the main
The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep
Upbreathed from the marshes a message of range and of sweep
Interwoven with waftures of wild sealiberties drifting
 Came through the lapped leaves sifting sifting
 Came to the gates of sleep
Then my thoughts in the dark of the dungeonkeep
Of the Castle of Captives hid in the City of Sleep
Upstarted by twos and by threes assembling
 The gates of sleep fell atrembling
Like as the lips of a lady that forth falter Yes
 Shaken with happiness
 The gates of sleep stood wide

I have waked I have come my beloved I might not abide
I have come ere the dawn O beloved my liveoaks to hide
 In your gospelling glooms  to be
As a lover in heaven the marsh my marsh and the sea my sea

Tell me sweet burlybarkd manbodied Tree
That mine arms in the dark are embracing dost know
From what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow
They rise not from reason but deeper inconsequent deeps
 Reasons not one that weeps
 What logic of greeting lies
Betwixt dear overbeautiful trees and the rain of the eyes

O cunning green leaves little masters like as ye gloss
All the dulltissued dark with your luminous darks that emboss
The vague blackness of night into pattern and plan
 So
 But would I could know but would I could know
With your question embroidring the dark of the question of man 
So with your silences purfling this silence of man
While his cry to the dead for some knowledge is under the ban
 Under the ban 
 So ye have wrought me
Designs on the night of our knowledge  yea ye have taught me
 So
 That haply we know somewhat more than we know

 Ye lispers whisperers singers in storms
 Ye consciences murmuring faiths under forms
 Ye ministers meet for each passion that grieves
 Friendly sisterly sweetheart leaves
Oh rain me down from your darks that contain me
Wisdoms ye winnow from winds that pain me 
Sift down tremors of sweetwithinsweet
That advise me of more than they bring  repeat
Me the woodssmell that swiftly but now brought breath
From the heavenside bank of the river of death 
 Teach me the terms of silence  preach me
 The passion of patience  sift me  impeach me 
 And there oh there
As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air
 Pray me a myriad prayer

 My gossip the owl  is it thou
That out of the leaves of the lowhanging bough
 As I pass to the beach art stirred
 Dumb woods have ye uttered a bird

     

Reverend Marsh lowcouched along the sea
 Old chemist rapt in alchemy
 Distilling silence  lo
That which our fatherage had died to know 
 The menstruum that dissolves all matter  thou
Hast found it for this silence filling now
The globed clarity of receiving space
This solves us all man matter doubt disgrace
Death love sin sanity
Must in yon silence clear solution lie
Too clear That crystal nothing wholl peruse
The blackest night could bring us brighter news
Yet precious qualities of silence haunt
Round these vast margins ministrant
Oh if thy souls at latter gasp for space
With trying to breathe no bigger than thy race
Just to be fellowd when that thou hast found
No man with room or grace enough of bound
To entertain that New thou tellst thou art 
Tis here tis here thou canst unhand thy heart
And breathe it free and breathe it free
By rangy marsh in lone sealiberty

The tides at full the marsh with flooded streams
Glimmers a limpid labyrinth of dreams
Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies
A rhapsody of morningstars The skies
Shine scant with one forked galaxy 
The marsh brags ten looped on his breast they lie

Oh what if a sound should be made
Oh what if a bound should be laid
To this bowandstring tension of beauty and silence aspring 
To the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string
I fear me I fear me yon dome of diaphanous gleam
Will break as a bubble oerblown in a dream 
Yon dome of tootenuous tissues of space and of night
Overweighted with stars overfreighted with light
Oversated with beauty and silence will seem
 But a bubble that broke in a dream
If a bound of degree to this grace be laid
 Or a sound or a motion made

But no it is made list somewhere  mystery where
 In the leaves in the air
In my heart is a motion made
Tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade
In the leaves tis palpable low multitudinous stirring
Upwinds through the woods the little ones softly conferring
Have settled my lords to be looked for so they are still
But the air and my heart and the earth are athrill 
And look where the wild duck sails round the bend of the river 
 And look where a passionate shiver
 Expectant is bending the blades
Of the marshgrass in serial shimmers and shades 
And invisible wings fast fleeting fast fleeting
 Are beating
The dark overhead as my heart beats  and steady and free
Is the ebbtide flowing from marsh to sea 
 Run home little streams
 With your lapfulls of stars and dreams 
And a sailor unseen is hoisting apeak
For list down the inshore curve of the creek
 How merrily flutters the sail 
And lo in the East Will the East unveil
The East is unveiled the East hath confessed
A flush tis dead tis alive tis dead ere the West
Was aware of it nay tis abiding tis unwithdrawn
 Have a care sweet Heaven Tis Dawn

Now a dream of a flame through that dream of a flush is uprolled
 To the zenith ascending a dome of undazzling gold
Is builded in shape as a beehive from out of the sea
The hive is of gold undazzling but oh the Bee
 The starfed Bee the buildfire Bee
 Of dazzling gold is the great SunBee
That shall flash from the hivehole over the sea

 Yet now the dewdrop now the morning gray
 Shall live their little lucid sober day
 Ere with the sun their souls exhale away
Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew
The summd morn shines complete as in the blue
Big dewdrop of all heaven with these lit shrines
Oersilvered to the farthest seaconfines
The sacramental marsh one pious plain
Of worship lies Peace to the antereign
Of Mary Morning blissful mother mild
Minded of nought but peace and of a child

Not slower than Majesty moves for a mean and a measure
Of motion  not faster than dateless Olympian leisure
Might pace with unblown ample garments from pleasure to pleasure 
The waveserrate searim sinks unjarring unreeling
 Forever revealing revealing revealing
Edgewise bladewise halfwise wholewise  tis done
 Goodmorrow lord Sun
With several voice with ascription one
The woods and the marsh and the sea and my soul
Unto thee whence the glittering stream of all morrows doth roll
Cry good and pastgood and most heavenly morrow lord Sun

O Artisan born in the purple  Workman Heat 
Parter of passionate atoms that travail to meet
And be mixed in the deathcold oneness  innermost Guest
At the marriage of elements  fellow of publicans  blest
King in the blouse of flame that loiterest oer
The idle skies yet laborest fast evermore 
Thou in the fine forgethunder thou in the beat
Of the heart of a man thou Motive  Laborer Heat
Yea Artist thou of whose art yon seas all news
With his inshore greens and manifold midsea blues
Pearlglint shelltint ancientest perfectest hues
Ever shaming the maidens  lily and rose
Confess thee and each mild flame that glows
In the clarified virginal bosoms of stones that shine
 It is thine it is thine

Thou chemist of storms whether driving the winds aswirl
Or aflicker the subtiler essences polar that whirl
In the magnet earth  yea thou with a storm for a heart
Rent with debate manyspotted with question part
From part oft sundered yet ever a globed light
Yet ever the artist ever more large and bright
Than the eye of a man may avail of  manifold One
I must pass from thy face I must pass from the face of the Sun
Old Want is awake and agog every wrinkle afrown
The worker must pass to his work in the terrible town
But I fear not nay and I fear not the thing to be done
 I am strong with the strength of my lord the Sun
How dark how dark soever the race that must needs be run
 I am lit with the Sun

Oh never the masthigh run of the seas
 Of traffic shall hide thee
Never the hellcolored smoke of the factories
 Hide thee
Never the reek of the times fenpolitics
 Hide thee
And ever my heart through the night shall with knowledge abide thee
And ever by day shall my spirit as one that hath tried thee
 Labor at leisure in art  till yonder beside thee
 My soul shall float friend Sun
 The day being done

 II Individuality


Sail on sail on fair cousin Cloud
Oh loiter hither from the sea
 Stilleyed and shadowbrowd
Steal off from yon fardrifting crowd
And come and brood upon the marsh with me

Yon laboring low horizonsmoke
Yon stringent sail toil not for thee
 Nor me did heavens stroke
The whole deep with drownd commerce choke
No pitiless tease of risk or bottomry

Would to thy rainy office close
Thy will or lock mine eyes from tears
 Part wept for traderswoes
Part for that ventures mean as those
In issue bind such sovereign hopes and fears

 Lo Cloud thy downward countenance stares
Blank on the blankfaced marsh and thou
 Mindest of dark affairs
Thy substance seems a warp of cares
Like late wounds run the wrinkles on thy brow

Well mayst thou pause and gloom and stare
A visible conscience I arraign
 Thee criminal Cloud of rare
Contempts on Mercy Right and Prayer 
Of murders arsons thefts  of nameless stain

Yet though lifes logic grow as gray
As thou my souls not in eclipse
 Cold Cloud but yesterday
Thy lightning slew a child at play
And then a priest with prayers upon his lips

For his enemies and then a bright
Lady that did but ope the door
 Upon the storming night
To let a beggar in  strange spite 
And then thy sulky rain refused to pour

Till thy quick torch a barn had burned
Where twelve months store of victual lay
 A widows sons had earned
Which done thy floods with winds returned 
The river raped their little herd away

What myriad righteous errands high
Thy flames MIGHT run on In that hour
 Thou slewest the child oh why
Not rather slay Calamity
Breeder of Pain and Doubt infernal Power

Or why not plunge thy blades about
Some maggot politician throng
 Swarming to parcel out
The body of a land and rout
The mawconventicle and ungorge Wrong

 What the cloud doeth
 The Lord knoweth
 The cloud knoweth not
 What the artist doeth
 The Lord knoweth
 Knoweth the artist not

Wellanswered  O dear artists ye
 Whether in forms of curve or hue
 Or tone your gospels be 
Say wrong This work is not of me
But God it is not true it is not true

Awful is Art because tis free
The artist trembles oer his plan
 Where men his Self must see
Who made a song or picture he
Did it and not another God nor man

My Lord is large my Lord is strong
Giving He gave my me is mine
 How poor how strange how wrong
To dream He wrote the little song
I made to Him with loves unforced design

Oh not as clouds dim laws have plannd
To strike down Good and fight for Ill 
 Oh not as harps that stand
In the wind and sound the winds command
Each artist  gift of terror  owns his will

For thee Cloud  if thou spend thine all
Upon the Souths oerbrimming sea
 That needs thee not or crawl
To the dry provinces and fall
Till every convert clod shall give to thee

Green worship if thou grow or fade
Bring on delight or misery
 Fly east or west be made
Snow hail rain wind grass rose light shade
What matters it to thee There is no thee

Pass kinsman Cloud now fair and mild
Discharge the will thats not thine own
 I work in freedom wild
But work as plays a little child
Sure of the Father Self and Love alone

 III Marsh Song  At Sunset


Over the monstrous shambling sea
 Over the Caliban sea
Bright Arielcloud thou lingerest
Oh wait oh wait in the warm red West 
 Thy Prospero Ill be

Over the humped and fishy sea
 Over the Caliban sea
O cloud in the West like a thought in the heart
Of pardon loose thy wing and start
 And do a grace for me

Over the huge and huddling sea
 Over the Caliban sea
Bring hither my brother Antonio  Man 
My injurer night breaks the ban
 Brother I pardon thee

 IV The Marshes of Glynn


Glooms of the liveoaks beautifulbraided and woven
With intricate shades of the vines that myriadcloven
 Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs 
 Emerald twilights 
 Virginal shy lights
Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows
When lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades
Of the dim sweet woods of the dear dark woods
 Of the heavenly woods and glades
That run to the radiant marginal sandbeach within
 The wide seamarshes of Glynn 

Beautiful glooms soft dusks in the noonday fire 
Wildwood privacies closets of lone desire
Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves 
Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves
Pure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood
Cool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good 

O braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine
While the riotous noonday sun of the Juneday long did shine
Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine
But now when the noon is no more and riot is rest
And the sun is await at the ponderous gate of the West
And the slant yellow beam down the woodaisle doth seem
Like a lane into heaven that leads from a dream 
Ay now when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak
And my heart is at ease from men and the wearisome sound of the stroke
 Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low
 And belief overmasters doubt and I know that I know
 And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within
That the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn
Will work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore
When length was fatigue and when breadth was but bitterness sore
And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain
Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain 

Oh now unafraid I am fain to face
 The vast sweet visage of space
To the edge of the wood I am drawn I am drawn
Where the gray beach glimmering runs as a belt of the dawn
 For a mete and a mark
 To the forestdark 
 So
Affable liveoak leaning low 
Thus  with your favor  soft with a reverent hand
Not lightly touching your person Lord of the land
Bending your beauty aside with a step I stand
On the firmpacked sand
 Free
By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea

 Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band
 Of the sandbeach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land
Inward and outward to northward and southward the beachlines linger and curl
As a silverwrought garment that clings to and follows
 the firm sweet limbs of a girl
Vanishing swerving evermore curving again into sight
Softly the sandbeach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light
And what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high
The world lies east how ample the marsh and the sea and the sky
A league and a league of marshgrass waisthigh broad in the blade
Green and all of a height and unflecked with a light or a shade
Stretch leisurely off in a pleasant plain
To the terminal blue of the main

Oh what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea
 Somehow my soul seems suddenly free
From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin
By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn

Ye marshes how candid and simple and nothingwithholding and free
Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea
Tolerant plains that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun
Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won
God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain
And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain

As the marshhen secretly builds on the watery sod
Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God
I will fly in the greatness of God as the marshhen flies
In the freedom that fills all the space twixt the marsh and the skies
By so many roots as the marshgrass sends in the sod
I will heartily lay me ahold on the greatness of God
Oh like to the greatness of God is the greatness within
The range of the marshes the liberal marshes of Glynn

And the sea lends large as the marsh lo out of his plenty the sea
Pours fast full soon the time of the floodtide must be
Look how the grace of the sea doth go
About and about through the intricate channels that flow
 Here and there
 Everywhere
Till his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the lowlying lanes
And the marsh is meshed with a million veins
That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow
 In the roseandsilver evening glow
 Farewell my lord Sun
The creeks overflow a thousand rivulets run
Twixt the roots of the sod the blades of the marshgrass stir
Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr
Passeth and all is still and the currents cease to run
And the sea and the marsh are one

How still the plains of the waters be
The tide is in his ecstasy
The tide is at his highest height
 And it is night

And now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep
Roll in on the souls of men
But who will reveal to our waking ken
The forms that swim and the shapes that creep
 Under the waters of sleep
And I would I could know what swimmeth below when the tide comes in
On the length and the breadth of the marvellous marshes of Glynn

Clover

Inscribed to the Memory of John Keats



Dear uplands Chesters favorable fields
My large unjealous Loves many yet one 
A grave goodmorrow to your Graces all
Fair tilth and fruitful seasons
 Lo how still
The midmorn empties you of men save me
Speak to your lover meadows None can hear
I lie as lies yon placid Brandywine
Holding the hills and heavens in my heart
For contemplation
 Tis a perfect hour
From founts of dawn the fluent autumn day
Has rippled as a brook right pleasantly
Halfway to noon but now with widening turn
Makes pause in lucent meditation locked
And rounds into a silver pool of morn
Bottomd with cloverfields My heart just hears
Eight lingering strokes of some far villagebell
That speak the hour so inwardvoiced meseems
Times conscience has but whispered him eight hints
Of revolution Reigns that mild surcease
That stills the middle of each rural morn 
When nimble noises that with sunrise ran
About the farms have sunk again to rest
When Tom no more across the horselot calls
To sleepy Dick nor Dick huskvoiced upbraids
The swaybackd roan for stamping on his foot
With sulphurous oath and kick in flank what time
The cartchain clinks across the slanting shaft
And kitchenward the rattling bucket plumps
Souse down the well where quivering ducks quack loud
And Susan Cook is singing
 Up the sky
The hesitating moon slow trembles on
Faint as a newwashed soul but lately up
From out a buried body Far about
A hundred slopes in hundred fantasies
Most ravishingly run so smooth of curve
That I but seem to see the fluent plain
Rise toward a rain of cloverblooms as lakes
Pout gentle mounds of plashment up to meet
Big showerdrops Now the little winds as bees
Bowing the blooms come wandering where I lie
Mixt soul and body with the clovertufts
Light on my spirit give from wing and thigh
Rich pollens and divine sweet irritants
To every nerve and freshly make report
Of inmost Natures secret autumnthought
Unto some soul of sense within my frame
That owns each cognizance of the outlying five
And sees hears tastes smells touches all in one

Tell me dear Clover since my soul is thine
Since I am fain give study all the day
To make thy ways my ways thy service mine
To seek me out thy God my God to be
And die from out myself to live in thee 
Now Cousin Clover tell me in mine ear
Gost thou to market with thy pink and green
Of what avail this color and this grace
Wert thou but squat of stem and brindlebrown
Still careless herds would feed A poet thou
What worth what worth the whole of all thine art
ThreeLeaves instruct me I am sick of price
Framed in the arching of two cloverstems
Wherethrough I gaze from off my hill afar
The spacious fields from me to Heaven take on
Tremors of change and new significance
To th eye as to the ear a simple tale
Begins to hint a parables sense beneath
The prospect widens cuts all bounds of blue
Where horizontal limits bend and spreads
Into a curioushilld and curiousvalleyd Vast
Endless before behind around which seems
Th incalculable UpandDown of Time
Made plain before mine eyes The cloverstems
Still cover all the space but now they bear
For cloverblooms fair stately heads of men
With poets faces heartsome dear and pale 
Sweet visages of all the souls of time
Whose loving service to the world has been
In the artists way expressed and bodied Oh
In arms reach here be Dante Keats Chopin
Raphael Lucretius Omar Angelo
Beethoven Chaucer Schubert Shakespeare Bach
And Buddha sweetest masters Let me lay
These arms this once this humble once about
Your reverend necks  the most containing clasp
For all in all this world eer saw and there
Yet further on bright throngs unnamable
Of workers worshipful nobilities
In the Court of Gentle Service silent men
Dwellers in woods brooders on helpful art
And all the press of them the fair the large
That wrought with beauty
 Lo what bulk is here
Now comes the Courseofthings shaped like an Ox
Slow browsing oer my hillside ponderously 
The hugebrawned tame and workful Courseofthings
That hath his grass if earth be round or flat
And hath his grass if empires plunge in pain
Or faiths flash out This cool unasking Ox
Comes browsing oer my hills and vales of Time
And thrusts me out his tongue and curls it sharp
And sicklewise about my poets heads
And twists them in all  Dante Keats Chopin
Raphael Lucretius Omar Angelo
Beethoven Chaucer Schubert Shakespeare Bach
And Buddha in one sheaf  and champs and chews
With slantlychurning jaws and swallows down
Then slowly plants a mighty forefoot out
And makes advance to futureward one inch
So they have played their part
 And to this end
This God This troublousbreeding Earth This Sun
Of hot quick pains To this noend that ends
These Masters wrought and wept and sweated blood
And burned and loved and ached with public shame
And found no friends to breathe their loves to save
Woods and wet pillows This was all This Ox
Nay quoth a sum of voices in mine ear
Gods clover we and feed His Courseofthings
The pasture is Gods pasture systems strange
Of food and fiberment He hath whereby
The general brawn is built for plans of His
To quality precise Kinsman learn this
The artists market is the heart of man
The artists price some little good of man
Tease not thy vision with vain search for ends
The End of Means is art that works by love
The End of Ends    in Gods Beginnings lost

The Waving of the Corn



 Ploughman whose gnarly hand yet kindly wheeled
Thy plough to ring this solitary tree
 With clover whose round plat reserved afield
In cool green radius twice my length may be 
 Scanting the corn thy furrows else might yield
To pleasure August bees fair thoughts and me
 That here come oft together  daily I
 Stretched prone in summers mortal ecstasy
Do stir with thanks to thee as stirs this morn
 With waving of the corn

 Unseen the farmers boy from round the hill
Whistles a snatch that seeks his soul unsought
 And fills some time with tune howbeit shrill
The cricket tells straight on his simple thought 
 Nay tis the crickets way of being still
The peddler bee drones in and gossips naught
 Far down the wood a onedesiring dove
 Times me the beating of the heart of love
And these be all the sounds that mix each morn
 With waving of the corn

 From here to where the louder passions dwell
Green leagues of hilly separation roll
 Trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell
Ye terrible Towns neer claim the trembling soul
 That craftless all to buy or hoard or sell
From out your deadly complex quarrel stole
 To company with large amiable trees
 Suck honey summer with unjealous bees
And take Times strokes as softly as this morn
 Takes waving of the corn

The Song of the Chattahoochee



 Out of the hills of Habersham
 Down the valleys of Hall
I hurry amain to reach the plain
Run the rapid and leap the fall
Split at the rock and together again
Accept my bed or narrow or wide
And flee from folly on every side
With a lovers pain to attain the plain
 Far from the hills of Habersham
 Far from the valleys of Hall

 All down the hills of Habersham
 All through the valleys of Hall
The rushes cried Abide abide
The willful waterweeds held me thrall
The laving laurel turned my tide
The ferns and the fondling grass said Stay
The dewberry dipped for to work delay
And the little reeds sighed Abide abide
 Here in the hills of Habersham
 Here in the valleys of Hall

 High oer the hills of Habersham
 Veiling the valleys of Hall
The hickory told me manifold
Fair tales of shade the poplar tall
Wrought me her shadowy self to hold
The chestnut the oak the walnut the pine
Overleaning with flickering meaning and sign
Said Pass not so cold these manifold
 Deep shades of the hills of Habersham
 These glades in the valleys of Hall

 And oft in the hills of Habersham
 And oft in the valleys of Hall
The white quartz shone and the smooth brookstone
Did bar me of passage with friendly brawl
And many a luminous jewel lone
 Crystals clear or acloud with mist
Ruby garnet and amethyst 
Made lures with the lights of streaming stone
 In the clefts of the hills of Habersham
 In the beds of the valleys of Hall

 But oh not the hills of Habersham
 And oh not the valleys of Hall
Avail I am fain for to water the plain
Downward the voices of Duty call 
Downward to toil and be mixed with the main
The dry fields burn and the mills are to turn
And a myriad flowers mortally yearn
And the lordly main from beyond the plain
 Calls oer the hills of Habersham
 Calls through the valleys of Hall

From the Flats



 What heartache  neer a hill
Inexorable vapid vague and chill
The drear sandlevels drain my spirit low
With one poor word they tell me all they know
Whereat their stupid tongues to tease my pain
Do drawl it oer again and oer again
They hurt my heart with griefs I cannot name
 Always the same the same

 Nature hath no surprise
No ambuscade of beauty gainst mine eyes
From brake or lurking dell or deep defile
No humors frolic forms  this mile that mile
No rich reserves or happyvalley hopes
Beyond the bend of roads the distant slopes
Her fancy fails her wild is all run tame
 Ever the same the same

 Oh might I through these tears
But glimpse some hill my Georgia high uprears
Where white the quartz and pink the pebble shine
The hickory heavenward strives the muscadine
Swings oer the slope the oaks farfalling shade
Darkens the dogwood in the bottom glade
And down the hollow from a ferny nook
 Bright leaps a living brook

The MockingBird



Superb and sole upon a plumed spray
That oer the general leafage boldly grew
He summd the woods in song or typic drew
The watch of hungry hawks the lone dismay
Of languid doves when long their lovers stray
And all birds passionplays that sprinkle dew
At morn in brake or bosky avenue
Whateer birds did or dreamed this bird could say
Then down he shot bounced airily along
The sward twitched in a grasshopper made song
Midflight perched prinked and to his art again
Sweet Science this large riddle read me plain
How may the death of that dull insect be
The life of yon trim Shakespeare on the tree




Tampa Robins



The robin laughed in the orangetree
Ho windy North a fig for thee
While breasts are red and wings are bold
And green trees wave us globes of gold
 Times scythe shall reap but bliss for me
  Sunlight song and the orangetree

Burn golden globes in leafy sky
My orangeplanets crimson I
Will shine and shoot among the spheres
Blithe meteor that no mortal fears
 And thrid the heavenly orangetree
 With orbits bright of minstrelsy

If that I hate wild winters spite 
The gibbet trees the world in white
The sky but gray wind over a grave 
Why should I ache the seasons slave
 Ill sing from the top of the orangetree
 Gramercy winters tyranny

Ill south with the sun and keep my clime
My wing is king of the summertime
My breast to the sun his torch shall hold
And Ill call down through the green and gold
 Time take thy scythe reap bliss for me
 Bestir thee under the orangetree

The Crystal



At midnight deaths and truths unlocking time
When far within the spirits hearing rolls
The great soft rumble of the course of things 
A bulk of silence in a mask of sound 
When darkness clears our vision that by day
Is sunblind and the souls a ravening owl
For truth and flitteth here and there about
Lowlying woody tracts of time and oft
Is minded for to sit upon a bough
Drydead and sharp of some longstricken tree
And muse in that gaunt place  twas then my heart
Deep in the meditative dark cried out

Ye companies of governorspirits grave
Bards and old bringersdown of flaming news
From steepwalld heavens holy malcontents
Sweet seers and stellar visionaries all
That brood about the skies of poesy
Full bright ye shine insuperable stars
Yet if a man look hard upon you none
With total lustre blazeth no not one
But hath some heinous freckle of the flesh
Upon his shining cheek not one but winks
His ray opaqued with intermittent mist
Of defect yea you masters all must ask
Some sweet forgiveness which we leap to give
We lovers of you heavenlyglad to meet
Your largesse so with love and interplight
Your geniuses with our mortalities

Thus unto thee O sweetest Shakespeare sole
A hundred hurts a day I do forgive
Tis little but enchantment tis for thee
Small curious quibble Juliets prurient pun
In the poor pale face of Romeos fancied death
Cold rant of Richard Henrys fustian roar
Which frights away that sleep he invocates
Wronged Valentines unnatural haste to yield
Toosilly shifts of maids that mask as men
In faint disguises that could neer disguise 
Viola Julia Portia Rosalind
Fatigues most drear and needless overtax
Of speech obscure that had as lief be plain
Last I forgive with more delight because
Tis more to do the laboredlewd discourse
That een thy young inventions youngest heir
Besmirched the world with

 Father Homer thee
Thee also I forgive thy sandy wastes
Of prose and catalogue thy drear harangues
That tease the patience of the centuries
Thy sleazy scrap of story  but a rogues
Rape of a lightolove  too soiled a patch
To broider with the gods

 Thee Socrates
Thou dear and very strong one I forgive
Thy yearworn cloak thine iron stringencies
That were but dandy upsidedown thy words
Of truth that mildlier spoke had mainlier wrought

So Buddha beautiful I pardon thee
That all the All thou hadst for needy man
Was Nothing and thy Best of being was
But not to be

 Worn Dante I forgive
The implacable hates that in thy horrid hells
Or burn or freeze thy fellows never loosed
By death nor time nor love

 And I forgive
Thee Milton those thy comicdreadful wars
Where armed with gross and inconclusive steel
Immortals smite immortals mortalwise
And fill all heaven with folly

 Also thee
Brave Aeschylus thee I forgive for that
Thine eye by bare bright justice basilisked
Turned not nor ever learned to look where Love
Stands shining

 So unto thee Lucretius mine
For oh what heart hath loved thee like to this
Thats now complaining freely I forgive
Thy logic poor thine error rich thine earth
Whose graves eat souls and all

 Yea all you hearts
Of beauty and sweet righteous lovers large
Aurelius fine oft superfine mild Saint
A Kempis overmild Epictetus
Whiles low in thought still with old slavery tinct
Rapt Behmen rapt too far high Swedenborg
Oertoppling Langley that with but a touch
Of art hadst sung Piers Plowman to the top
Of English songs whereof tis dearest now
And most adorable Caedmon in the morn
Acalling angels with the cowherds call
That late brought up the cattle Emerson
Most wise that yet in finding Wisdom lost
Thy Self sometimes tense Keats with angels nerves
Where mens were better Tennyson largest voice
Since Milton yet some register of wit
Wanting  all all I pardon ere tis asked
Your more or less your little mole that marks
You brother and your kinship seals to man

But Thee but Thee O sovereign Seer of time
But Thee O poets Poet Wisdoms Tongue
But Thee O mans best Man O loves best Love
O perfect life in perfect labor writ
O all mens Comrade Servant King or Priest 
What if or yet what mole what flaw what lapse
What least defect or shadow of defect
What rumor tattled by an enemy
Of inference loose what lack of grace
Even in tortures grasp or sleeps or deaths 
Oh what amiss may I forgive in Thee
Jesus good Paragon thou Crystal Christ

The Revenge of Hamish



It was three slim does and a tentined buck in the bracken lay
 And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man
 Awaft on a windshift wavered and ran
Down the hillside and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way

Then Nan got atremble at nostril she was the daintiest doe
 In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern
 She reared and rounded her ears in turn
Then the buck leapt up and his head as a kings to a crown did go

Full high in the breeze and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer
 And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose
 For their daydream slowlier came to a close
Till they woke and were still breathbound with waiting and wonder and fear

Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock the hounds shot by
 The does and the tentined buck made a marvellous bound
 The hounds swept after with never a sound
But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh

For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild
 And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds
 For to drive him the deer to the lower glengrounds
I will kill a red deer quoth Maclean in the sight of the wife
 and the child

So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand
 But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead Go turn 
 Cried Maclean  if the deer seek to cross to the burn
Do thou turn them to me nor fail lest thy back be red as thy hand

Now hardfortuned Hamish half blown of his breath with the height
 of the hill
 Was white in the face when the tentined buck and the does
 Drew leaping to burnward huskily rose
His shouts and his nether lip twitched and his legs were oerweak
 for his will

So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn
 But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below
 Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go
All the space of an hour then he went and his face was greenish and stern

And his eye sat back in the socket and shrunken the eyeballs shone
 As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see
 Now now grim henchman what ist with thee
Brake Maclean and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown

Three does and a tentined buck made out spoke Hamish full mild
 And I ran for to turn but my breath it was blown and they passed
 I was weak for ye called ere I broke me my fast
Cried Maclean Now a tentined buck in the sight of the wife and the child

I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me a snails own wrong
 Then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all
 Ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall
And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong

So Hamish made bare and took him his strokes at the last he smiled
 Now Ill to the burn quoth Maclean for it still may be
 If a slimmerpaunched henchman will hurry with me
I shall kill me the tentined buck for a gift to the wife and the child

Then the clansmen departed by this path and that and over the hill
 Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame
 And that place of the lashing full quiet became
And the wife and the child stood sad and bloodybacked Hamish sat still

But look red Hamish has risen quick about and about turns he
 There is none betwixt me and the cragtop he screams under breath
 Then livid as Lazarus lately from death
He snatches the child from the mother and clambers the crag toward the sea

Now the mother drops breath she is dumb and her heart goes dead for a space
 Till the motherhood mistress of death shrieks shrieks through the glen
 And that place of the lashing is live with men
And Maclean and the gillie that told him dash up in a desperate race

Not a breaths time for asking an eyeglance reveals all the tale untold
 They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea
 And the lady cries Clansmen run for a fee 
Yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold

Fast Hamish back from the brink  and ever she flies up the steep
 And the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
 But mother tis vain but father tis vain
Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink and dangles the child oer the deep

Now a faintness falls on the men that run and they all stand still
 And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God on her knees
 Crying Hamish O Hamish but please but please
For to spare him and Hamish still dangles the child with a wavering will

On a sudden he turns with a seahawk scream and a gibe and a song
 Cries So I will spare ye the child if in sight of ye all
 Ten blows on Macleans bare back shall fall
And ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong

Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red
 Breathed short for a space said Nay but it never shall be
 Let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea
But the wife Can Hamish go fish us the child from the sea if dead

Say yea  Let them lash ME Hamish  Nay  Husband
 the lashing will heal
 But oh who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave
 Could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave
Quick Love I will bare thee  so  kneel Then Maclean gan slowly
 to kneel

With never a word till presently downward he jerked to the earth
 Then the henchman  he that smote Hamish  would tremble and lag
 Strike hard quoth Hamish full stern from the crag
Then he struck him and One sang Hamish and danced with the child
 in his mirth

And no man spake beside Hamish he counted each stroke with a song
 When the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height
 And he held forth the child in the heartaching sight
Of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong

And there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer 
 And there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace
 Till her finger nigh felt of the bairnies face 
In a flash fierce Hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air

And sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea
 Shrill screeching Revenge in the windrush and pallid Maclean
 Agefeeble with anger and impotent pain
Crawled up on the crag and lay flat and locked hold of dead roots
 of a tree 

And gazed hungrily oer and the blood from his back dripdripped
 in the brine
 And a seahawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew
 And the mother stared white on the waste of blue
And the wind drove a cloud to seaward and the sun began to shine

To Bayard Taylor



To range deepwrapt along a heavenly height
 Oerseeing all that man but undersees
To loiter down lone alleys of delight
 And hear the beating of the hearts of trees
And think the thoughts that lilies speak in white
 By greenwood pools and pleasant passages

With healthy dreams adream in flesh and soul
 To pace in mighty meditations drawn
From out the forest to the open knoll
 Where much thyme is whence blissful leagues of lawn
Betwixt the fringing woods to southward roll
 By tender inclinations mad with dawn

Ablaze with fires that flame in silver dew
 When each small globe doth glass the morningstar
Long ere the sun sweetsmitten through and through
 With dappled revelations read afar
Suffused with saintly ecstasies of blue
 As all the holy eastern heavens are 

To fare thus fervid to what daily toil
 Employs thy spirit in that larger Land
Where thou art gone to strive but not to moil
 In nothings that do mar the artists hand
Not drudge unriched as grain rots back to soil 
 No profit out of death  going yet still at stand 

Giving what life is here in hand today
 For that thats in tomorrows bush perchance 
Of this years harvest none in the barn to lay
 All sowed for next years crop  a dull advance
In curves that come but by another way
 Back to the start  a thriftless thrift of ants

Whose winter wastes their summer O my Friend
 Freely to range to muse to toil is thine
Thine now to watch with Homer sails that bend
 Unstained by Helens beauty oer the brine
Towrds some clean Troy no Hector need defend
 Nor flame devour or in some mild moons shine

Where amiabler winds the whistle heed
 To sail with Shelley oer a bluer sea
And mark Prometheus from his fetters freed
 Pass with Deucalion over Italy
While bursts the flame from out his eager reed
 Wildstretching towards the West of destiny

Or prone with Plato Shakespeare and a throng
 Of bards beneath some planetrees cool eclipse
To gaze on glowing meads where lingering long
 Psyches large Butterfly her honey sips
Or mingling free in choirs of German song
 To learn of Goethes life from Goethes lips

These these are thine and we who still are dead
 Do yearn  nay not to kill thee back again
Into this charnel life this lowlihead
 Not to the dark of sense the blinking brain
The hugged delusion drear the hunger fed
 On husks of guess the monarchy of pain

The cross of love the wrench of faith the shame
 Of science that cannot prove proof is the twist
Of blame for praise and bitter praise for blame
 The silly stake and tether round the wrist
By fashion fixed the virtue that doth claim
 The gains of vice the lofty mark thats missed

By all the mortal space twixt heaven and hell
 The souls sad growth oer stationary friends
Who hear us from our height not well not well
 The slant of accident the sudden bends
Of purpose tempered strong the gamblers spell
 The sons disgrace the plan that eer depends

On others plots the tricks that passion plays
 I loving you you him he none at all
The artists pain  to walk his bloodstained ways
 A special soul yet judged as general 
The endless grief of art the sneer that slays
 The war the wound the groan the funeral pall 

Not into these bright spirit do we yearn
 To bring thee back but oh to be to be
Unbound of all these gyves to stretch to spurn
 The dark from off our dolorous lids to see
Our spark Conjecture blaze and sunwise burn
 And suddenly to stand again by thee

Ah not for us not yet by thee to stand
 For us the fret the dark the thorn the chill
For us to call across unto thy Land
 Friend get thee to the minstrels holy hill
And kiss those brethren for us mouth and hand
 And make our duty to our master Will

A Dedication To Charlotte Cushman



As Love will carve dear names upon a tree
Symbol of gravure on his heart to be

So thought I thine with loving text to set
In the growth and substance of my canzonet

But writing it my tears begin to fall 
This wildrose stem for thy large names too small

Nay still my trembling hands are fain are fain
Cut the good letters though they lap again

Perchance such folk as mark the blur and stain
Will say It was the beating of the rain

Or haply these oerwoundings of the stem
May loose some little balm to plead for them

To Charlotte Cushman



Look where a threepoint star shall weave his beam
Into the slumbrous tissue of some stream
Till his bright self oer his bright copy seem
Fulfillment dropping on a cometrue dream
So in this night of art thy soul doth show
Her excellent double in the steadfast flow
Of wishing love that through mens hearts doth go
At once thou shinst above and shinst below
Een when thou strivest there within Arts sky
Each star must oer a strenuous orbit fly
Full calm thine image in our love doth lie
A Motion glassed in a Tranquillity
So triplerayed thou movst yet stayst serene 
Arts artist Loves dear woman Fames good queen

The StirrupCup



Death thourt a cordial old and rare
Look how compounded with what care
Time got his wrinkles reaping thee
Sweet herbs from all antiquity

David to thy distillage went
Keats and Gotama excellent

And Shakespeare for a kingdelight

Then Time let not a drop be spilt
Hand me the cup wheneer thou wilt
Tis thy rich stirrupcup to me
Ill drink it down right smilingly

A Song of Eternity in Time



 Once at night in the manor wood
 My Love and I long silent stood
 Amazed that any heavens could
Decree to part us bitterly repining
 My Love in aimless love and grief
 Reached forth and drew aside a leaf
 That just above us played the thief
And stole our starlight that for us was shining

 A star that had remarked her pain
 Shone straightway down that leafy lane
 And wrought his image mirrorplain
Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming
 Thus Time I cried is but a tear
 Some one hath wept twixt hope and fear
 Yet in his little lucent sphere
Our star of stars Eternity is beaming

Owl against Robin



Frowning the owl in the oak complained him
Sore that the song of the robin restrained him
Wrongly of slumber rudely of rest
From the north from the east from the south and the west
Woodland wheatfield cornfield clover
Over and over and over and over
Five oclock ten oclock twelve or seven
Nothing but robinsongs heard under heaven
 How can we sleep

Peep you whistle and cheep cheep cheep
Oh peep if you will and buy if tis cheap
And have done for an owl must sleep
Are ye singing for fame and who shall be first
Each days the same yet the last is worst
And the summer is cursed with the silly outburst
Of idiot redbreasts peeping and cheeping
By day when all honest birds ought to be sleeping
Lord what a din And so out of all reason
Have ye not heard that each thing hath its season
Night is to work in night is for playtime
 Good heavens not daytime

A vulgar flaunt is the flaring day
The impudent hot unsparing day
That leaves not a stain nor a secret untold 
Day the reporter  the gossip of old 
Deformitys tease  mans common scold 
Poh Shut the eyes let the sense go numb
When day down the eastern way has come
Tis clear as the moon by the argument drawn
From Design that the world should retire at dawn
Day kills The leaf and the laborer breathe
Death in the sun the cities seethe
The mortal black marshes bubble with heat
And puff up pestilence nothing is sweet
Has to do with the sun even virtue will taint
Philosophers say and manhood grow faint
In the lands where the villainous sun has sway
Through the livelong drag of the dreadful day
What Eden but noonlight stares it tame
Shadowless brazen forsaken of shame
For the sun tells lies on the landscape  now
Reports me the what unrelieved with the how 
As messengers lie with the facts alone
Delivering the word and withholding the tone

But oh the sweetness and oh the light
Of the highfastidious night
Oh to awake with the wise old stars 
The cultured the careful the Chesterfield stars
That wink at the workaday fact of crime
And shine so rich through the ruins of time
That Baalbec is finer than London oh
To sit on the bough that zigzags low
 By the woodland pool
And loudly laugh at man the fool
That vows to the vulgar sun oh rare
To wheel from the wood to the window where
A dayworn sleeper is dreaming of care
And perch on the sill and straightly stare
Through his visions rare to sail
Aslant with the hill and acurve with the vale 
To flit down the shadowshotwithgleam
Betwixt hanging leaves and starlit stream
Hither thither to and fro
Silent aimless dayless slow
Aimless Fieldmice True theyre slain
But the nightphilosophy hoots at pain
Grips eats quick and drops the bones
In the water beneath the bough nor moans
At the death life feeds on Robin pray
 Come away come away
To the cultus of night Abandon the day
Have more to think and have less to say
And CANNOT you walk now Bah dont hop
 Stop
Look at the owl scarce seen scarce heard
O irritant iterant maddening bird

A Song of the Future



 Sail fast sail fast
 Ark of my hopes Ark of my dreams
 Sweep lordly oer the drowned Past
 Fly glittering through the suns strange beams
 Sail fast sail fast
Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea
With news about the Future scent the sea
My brain is beating like the heart of Haste
Ill loose me a bird upon this Present waste
 Go trembling song
 And stay not long oh stay not long
 Thourt only a gray and sober dove
 But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love

Opposition



Of fret of dark of thorn of chill
 Complain no more for these O heart
Direct the random of the will
 As rhymes direct the rage of art

The lutes fixt fret that runs athwart
 The strain and purpose of the string
For governance and nice consort
 Doth bar his wilful wavering

The dark hath many dear avails
 The dark distils divinest dews
The dark is rich with nightingales
 With dreams and with the heavenly Muse

Bleeding with thorns of petty strife
 Ill ease as lovers do my smart
With sonnets to my lady Life
 Writ red in issues from the heart

What grace may lie within the chill
 Of favor frozen fast in scorn
When Goods afreeze we call it Ill
 This rosy Time is glacierborn

Of fret of dark of thorn of chill
 Complain thou not O heart for these
Bankin the current of the will
 To uses arts and charities

RoseMorals



 I  Red

 Would that my songs might be
 What roses make by day and night 
Distillments of my clod of misery
 Into delight

 Soul couldst thou bare thy breast
 As yon red rose and dare the day
All clean and large and calm with velvet rest
 Say yea  say yea

 Ah dear my Rose goodbye
 The wind is up so drift away
That songs from me as leaves from thee may fly
 I strive I pray


 II  White

 Soul get thee to the heart
 Of yonder tuberose hide thee there 
There breathe the meditations of thine art
 Suffused with prayer

 Of spirit grave yet light
 How fervent fragrances uprise
Pureborn from these most rich and yet most white
 Virginities

 Mulched with unsavory death
 Grow Soul unto such white estate
That virginalprayerful art shall be thy breath
 Thy work thy fate

Corn



Today the woods are trembling through and through
With shimmering forms that flash before my view
Then melt in green as dawnstars melt in blue
 The leaves that wave against my cheek caress
 Like womens hands the embracing boughs express
 A subtlety of mighty tenderness
 The copsedepths into little noises start
 That sound anon like beatings of a heart
 Anon like talk twixt lips not far apart
 The beech dreams balm as a dreamer hums a song
 Through that vague wafture expirations strong
 Throb from young hickories breathing deep and long
With stress and urgence bold of prisoned spring
 And ecstasy of burgeoning
 Now since the dewplashed road of morn is dry
 Forth venture odors of more quality
 And heavenlier giving Like Joves locks awry
 Long muscadines
Richwreathe the spacious foreheads of great pines
And breathe ambrosial passion from their vines
 I pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy
 That hide like gentle nuns from human eye
 To lift adoring perfumes to the sky
I hear faint bridalsighs of brown and green
Dying to silent hints of kisses keen
As far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen
 I start at fragmentary whispers blown
 From undertalks of leafy souls unknown
 Vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone
Dreaming of gods men nuns and brides between
Old companies of oaks that inward lean
To join their radiant amplitudes of green
 I slowly move with ranging looks that pass
 Up from the matted miracles of grass
Into yon veined complex of space
Where sky and leafage interlace
 So close the heaven of blue is seen
 Inwoven with a heaven of green

I wander to the zigzagcornered fence
Where sassafras intrenched in brambles dense
Contests with stolid vehemence
 The march of culture setting limb and thorn
 As pikes against the army of the corn

There while I pause my fieldwardfaring eyes
Take harvests where the stately cornranks rise
 Of inward dignities
And large benignities and insights wise
 Graces and modest majesties
Thus without theft I reap anothers field
Thus without tilth I house a wondrous yield
And heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed

Look out of line one tall corncaptain stands
Advanced beyond the foremost of his bands
 And waves his blades upon the very edge
 And hottest thicket of the battling hedge
Thou lustrous stalk that neer mayst walk nor talk
 Still shalt thou type the poetsoul sublime
 That leads the vanward of his timid time
 And sings up cowards with commanding rhyme 
Soul calm like thee yet fain like thee to grow
By double increment above below
 Soul homely as thou art yet rich in grace like thee
 Teaching the yeomen selfless chivalry
 That moves in gentle curves of courtesy
Soul filled like thy long veins with sweetness tense
 By every godlike sense
Transmuted from the four wild elements
 Drawn to high plans
 Thou liftst more stature than a mortal mans
Yet ever piercest downward in the mould
 And keepest hold
 Upon the reverend and steadfast earth
 That gave thee birth
 Yea standest smiling in thy future grave
 Serene and brave
 With unremitting breath
 Inhaling life from death
Thine epitaph writ fair in fruitage eloquent
 Thyself thy monument

 As poets should
Thou hast built up thy hardihood
With universal food
 Drawn in select proportion fair
 From honest mould and vagabond air
From darkness of the dreadful night
 And joyful light
 From antique ashes whose departed flame
 In thee has finer life and longer fame
From wounds and balms
From storms and calms
From potsherds and dry bones
 And ruinstones
Into thy vigorous substance thou hast wrought
Whateer the hand of Circumstance hath brought
 Yea into cool solacing green hast spun
 White radiance hot from out the sun
So thou dost mutually leaven
Strength of earth with grace of heaven
 So thou dost marry new and old
 Into a one of higher mould
 So thou dost reconcile the hot and cold
 The dark and bright
And many a heartperplexing opposite
 And so
 Akin by blood to high and low
Fitly thou playest out thy poets part
Richly expending thy muchbruised heart
 In equal care to nourish lord in hall
 Or beast in stall
 Thou tookst from all that thou mightst give to all

O steadfast dweller on the selfsame spot
Where thou wast born that still repinest not 
Type of the homefond heart the happy lot 
 Deeply thy mild content rebukes the land
 Whose flimsy homes built on the shifting sand
Of trade for ever rise and fall
With alternation whimsical
 Enduring scarce a day
 Then swept away
By swift engulfments of incalculable tides
Whereon capricious Commerce rides
Look thou substantial spirit of content
Across this little vale thy continent
 To where beyond the mouldering mill
 Yon old deserted Georgian hill
Bares to the sun his piteous aged crest
 And seamy breast
 By restlesshearted children left to lie
 Untended there beneath the heedless sky
 As barbarous folk expose their old to die
Upon that generousrounding side
 With gullies scarified
 Where keen Neglect his lash hath plied
Dwelt one I knew of old who played at toil
And gave to coquette Cotton soul and soil
 Scorning the slow reward of patient grain
 He sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain
 Then sat him down and waited for the rain
He sailed in borrowed ships of usury 
A foolish Jason on a treacherous sea
Seeking the Fleece and finding misery
 Lulled by smoothrippling loans in idle trance
 He lay content that unthrift Circumstance
 Should plough for him the stony field of Chance
Yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell
He staked his life on games of BuyandSell
And turned each field into a gamblers hell
 Aye as each year began
 My farmer to the neighboring city ran
Passed with a mournful anxious face
Into the bankers inner place
Parleyed excused pleaded for longer grace
 Railed at the drought the worm the rust the grass
 Protested neer again twould come to pass
 With many an oh and if and but alas
Parried or swallowed searching questions rude
And kissed the dust to soften Divess mood
At last small loans by pledges great renewed
 He issues smiling from the fatal door
 And buys with lavish hand his yearly store
 Till his small borrowings will yield no more
Aye as each year declined
With bitter heart and everbrooding mind
He mourned his fate unkind
 In dust in rain with might and main
 He nursed his cotton cursed his grain
 Fretted for news that made him fret again
Snatched at each telegram of Future Sale
And thrilled with Bulls or Bears alternate wail 
In hope or fear alike for ever pale
 And thus from year to year through hope and fear
 With many a curse and many a secret tear
 Striving in vain his cloud of debt to clear
 At last
He woke to find his foolish dreaming past
 And all his bestoflife the easy prey
 Of squandering scamps and quacks that lined his way
 With vile array
From rascal statesman down to petty knave
Himself at best for all his bragging brave
A gamesters catspaw and a bankers slave
 Then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest
 He fled away into the oblivious West
 Unmourned unblest

Old hill old hill thou gashed and hairy Lear
Whom the divine Cordelia of the year
Een pitying Spring will vainly strive to cheer 
 King that no subject man nor beast may own
 Discrowned undaughtered and alone 
Yet shall the great God turn thy fate
And bring thee back into thy monarch state
 And majesty immaculate
 Lo through hot waverings of the August morn
 Thou givest from thy vasty sides forlorn
 Visions of golden treasuries of corn 
Ripe largesse lingering for some bolder heart
That manfully shall take thy part
 And tend thee
 And defend thee
With antique sinew and with modern art

The Symphony



O Trade O Trade would thou wert dead
The Time needs heart  tis tired of head
Were all for love the violins said
Of what avail the rigorous tale
Of bill for coin and box for bale
Grant thee O Trade thine uttermost hope
Level red gold with blue skyslope
And base it deep as devils grope
When alls done what hast thou won
Of the only sweet thats under the sun
Ay canst thou buy a single sigh
Of true loves least least ecstasy
Then with a bridegrooms heartbeats trembling
All the mightier strings assembling
Ranged them on the violins side
As when the bridegroom leads the bride
And heart in voice together cried
Yea what avail the endless tale
Of gain by cunning and plus by sale
Look up the land look down the land
The poor the poor the poor they stand
Wedged by the pressing of Trades hand
Against an inwardopening door
That pressure tightens evermore
They sigh a monstrous foulair sigh
For the outside leagues of liberty
Where Art sweet lark translates the sky
Into a heavenly melody
Each day all day these poor folks say
In the same old yearlong drearlong way
We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns
We sieve minemeshes under the hills
And thieve much gold from the Devils bank tills
To relieve O God what manner of ills 
The beasts they hunger and eat and die
And so do we and the worlds a sty
Hush fellowswine why nuzzle and cry
Swinehood hath no remedy
Say many men and hasten by
Clamping the nose and blinking the eye
But who said once in the lordly tone
Man shall not live by bread alone
But all that cometh from the Throne
 Hath God said so
 But Trade saith No
And the kilns and the curttongued mills say Go
Theres plenty that can if you cant we know
Move out if you think youre underpaid
The poor are prolific were not afraid
 Trade is trade
Thereat this passionate protesting
Meekly changed and softened till
It sank to sad requesting
And suggesting sadder still
And oh if men might some time see
How piteousfalse the poor decree
That trade no more than trade must be
Does business mean Die you  live I
Then Trade is trade but sings a lie
Tis only war grown miserly
If business is battle name it so
Warcrimes less will shame it so
And widows less will blame it so
Alas for the poor to have some part
In yon sweet living lands of Art
Makes problem not for head but heart
Vainly might Platos brain revolve it
Plainly the heart of a child could solve it

And then as when from words that seem but rude
We pass to silent pain that sits abrood
Back in our hearts great dark and solitude
So sank the strings to gentle throbbing
Of long chords changemarked with sobbing 
Motherly sobbing not distinctlier heard
Than half wingopenings of the sleeping bird
Some dream of danger to her young hath stirred
Then stirring and demurring ceased and lo
Every least ripple of the strings songflow
Died to a level with each level bow
And made a great chord tranquilsurfaced so
As a brook beneath his curving bank doth go
To linger in the sacred dark and green
Where many boughs the still pool overlean
And many leaves make shadow with their sheen
 But presently
A velvet flutenote fell down pleasantly
Upon the bosom of that harmony
And sailed and sailed incessantly
As if a petal from a wildrose blown
Had fluttered down upon that pool of tone
And boatwise dropped o the convex side
And floated down the glassy tide
And clarified and glorified
The solemn spaces where the shadows bide
From the warm concave of that fluted note
Somewhat half song half odor forth did float
As if a rose might somehow be a throat
When Nature from her faroff glen
Flutes her soft messages to men
 The flute can say them oer again
 Yea Nature singing sweet and lone
Breathes through lifes strident polyphone
The flutevoice in the world of tone
 Sweet friends
 Mans love ascends
To finer and diviner ends
Than mans mere thought eer comprehends
For I een I
As here I lie
A petal on a harmony
Demand of Science whence and why
Mans tender pain mans inward cry
When he doth gaze on earth and sky
I am not overbold
 I hold
Full powers from Nature manifold
I speak for each notongued tree
That spring by spring doth nobler be
And dumbly and most wistfully
His mighty prayerful arms outspreads
Above mens oftunheeding heads
And his big blessing downward sheds
I speak for allshaped blooms and leaves
Lichens on stones and moss on eaves
Grasses and grains in ranks and sheaves
Broadfronded ferns and keenleaved canes
And briery mazes bounding lanes
And marshplants thirstycupped for rains
And milky stems and sugary veins
For every longarmed womanvine
That round a piteous tree doth twine
For passionate odors and divine
Pistils and petals crystalline
All purities of shady springs
All shynesses of filmwinged things
That fly from treetrunks and barkrings
All modesties of mountainfawns
That leap to covert from wild lawns
And tremble if the day but dawns
All sparklings of small beady eyes
Of birds and sidelong glances wise
Wherewith the jay hints tragedies
All piquancies of prickly burs
And smoothnesses of downs and furs
Of eiders and of minevers
All limpid honeys that do lie
At stamenbases nor deny
The hummingbirds fine roguery
Beethighs nor any butterfly
All gracious curves of slender wings
Barkmottlings fibrespiralings
Fernwavings and leafflickerings
Each dialmarked leaf and flowerbell
Wherewith in every lonesome dell
Time to himself his hours doth tell
All treesounds rustlings of pinecones
Windsighings doves melodious moans
And nights unearthly undertones
All placid lakes and waveless deeps
All cool reposing mountainsteeps
Valecalms and tranquil lotossleeps 
Yea all fair forms and sounds and lights
And warmths and mysteries and mights
Of Natures utmost depths and heights
 These doth my timid tongue present
Their mouthpiece and leal instrument
And servant all loveeloquent
I heard when All for love the violins cried
So Nature calls through all her system wide
Give me thy love O man so long denied
Much time is run and man hath changed his ways
Since Nature in the antique fabledays
Was hid from mans true love by proxy fays
False fauns and rascal gods that stole her praise
The nymphs cold creatures of mans colder brain
Chilled Natures streams till mans warm heart was fain
Never to lave its love in them again
Later a sweet Voice Love thy neighbor said
Then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread
Beyond all confines of old ethnic dread
Vainly the Jew might wag his covenant head
All men are neighbors so the sweet Voice said
So when mans arms had circled all mans race
The liberal compass of his warm embrace
Stretched bigger yet in the dark bounds of space
With hands agrope he felt smooth Natures grace
Drew her to breast and kissed her sweetheart face
Yea man found neighbors in great hills and trees
And streams and clouds and suns and birds and bees
And throbbed with neighborloves in loving these
But oh the poor the poor the poor
That stand by the inwardopening door
Trades hand doth tighten ever more
And sigh their monstrous foulair sigh
For the outside hills of liberty
Where Nature spreads her wild blue sky
For Art to make into melody
Thou Trade thou king of the modern days
 Change thy ways
 Change thy ways
Let the sweaty laborers file
 A little while
 A little while
Where Art and Nature sing and smile
Trade is thy heart all dead all dead
And hast thou nothing but a head
Im all for heart the flutevoice said
And into sudden silence fled
Like as a blush that while tis red
Dies to a still still white instead

 Thereto a thrilling calm succeeds
Till presently the silence breeds
A little breeze among the reeds
That seems to blow by seamarsh weeds
Then from the gentle stir and fret
Sings out the melting clarionet
Like as a lady sings while yet
Her eyes with salty tears are wet
O Trade O Trade the Lady said
I too will wish thee utterly dead
If all thy heart is in thy head
For O my God and O my God
What shameful ways have women trod
At beckoning of Trades golden rod
Alas when sighs are traders lies
And heartsease eyes and violet eyes
 Are merchandise
O purchased lips that kiss with pain
O cheeks coinspotted with smirch and stain
O trafficked hearts that break in twain
 And yet what wonder at my sisters crime
So hath Trade withered up Loves sinewy prime
Men love not women as in olden time
Ah not in these cold merchantable days
Deem men their life an opal gray where plays
The one red Sweet of gracious ladiespraise
Now comes a suitor with sharp prying eye 
Says Here you Lady if youll sell Ill buy
Come heart for heart  a trade What weeping why
Shame on such wooers dapper mercery
I would my lover kneeling at my feet
In humble manliness should cry O sweet
I know not if thy heart my heart will greet
I ask not if thy love my love can meet
Whateer thy worshipful soft tongue shall say
Ill kiss thine answer be it yea or nay
I do but know I love thee and I pray
To be thy knight until my dying day
Woe him that cunning trades in hearts contrives
Base love good women to base loving drives
If men loved larger larger were our lives
And wooed they nobler won they nobler wives

There thrust the bold straightforward horn
To battle for that lady lorn
With heartsome voice of mellow scorn
Like any knight in knighthoods morn
 Now comfort thee said he
 Fair Lady
For God shall right thy grievous wrong
And man shall sing thee a truelove song
Voiced in act his whole life long
 Yea all thy sweet life long
 Fair Lady
Wheres he that craftily hath said
The day of chivalry is dead
Ill prove that lie upon his head
 Or I will die instead
 Fair Lady
Is Honor gone into his grave
Hath Faith become a caitiff knave
And Selfhood turned into a slave
 To work in Mammons cave
 Fair Lady
Will Truths long blade neer gleam again
Hath Giant Trade in dungeons slain
All great contempts of meangot gain
 And hates of inward stain
 Fair Lady
For aye shall name and fame be sold
And place be hugged for the sake of gold
And smirchrobed Justice feebly scold
 At Crime all moneybold
 Fair Lady
Shall selfwrapt husbands aye forget
Kisspardons for the daily fret
Wherewith sweet wifely eyes are wet 
 Blind to lips kisswise set 
 Fair Lady
Shall lovers higgle heart for heart
Till wooing grows a trading mart
Where much for little and all for part
 Make love a cheapening art
 Fair Lady
Shall woman scorch for a single sin
That her betrayer may revel in
And she be burnt and he but grin
 When that the flames begin
 Fair Lady
Shall neer prevail the womans plea
We maids would far far whiter be
If that our eyes might sometimes see
 Men maids in purity
 Fair Lady
Shall Trade aye salve his conscienceaches
With jibes at Chivalrys old mistakes 
The wars that oerhot knighthood makes
 For Christs and ladies sakes
 Fair Lady
Now by each knight that eer hath prayed
To fight like a man and love like a maid
Since Pembrokes life as Pembrokes blade
 I the scabbard death was laid
 Fair Lady
I dare avouch my faith is bright
That God doth right and God hath might
Nor time hath changed His hair to white
 Nor His dear love to spite
 Fair Lady
I doubt no doubts I strive and shrive my clay
And fight my fight in the patient modern way
For true love and for thee  ah me and pray
 To be thy knight until my dying day
 Fair Lady
Made end that knightly horn and spurred away
Into the thick of the melodious fray

And then the hautboy played and smiled
And sang like any largeeyed child
Coolhearted and all undefiled
 Huge Trade he said
Would thou wouldst lift me on thy head
And run whereer my finger led
Once said a Man  and wise was He 
Never shalt thou the heavens see
Save as a little child thou be
Then oer sealashings of commingling tunes
The ancient wise bassoons
 Like weird
 Graybeard
Old harpers sitting on the high seadunes
 Chanted runes
Brightwaved gain graywaved loss
The sea of all doth lash and toss
One wave forward and one across
But now twas trough now tis crest
And worst doth foam and flash to best
 And curst to blest

Life Life thou seafugue writ from east to west
 Love Love alone can pore
 On thy dissolving score
 Of harsh halfphrasings
 Blotted ere writ
 And double erasings
 Of chords most fit
Yea Love sole musicmaster blest
May read thy weltering palimpsest
To follow Times dying melodies through
And never to lose the old in the new
And ever to solve the discords true 
 Love alone can do
And ever Love hears the poorfolks crying
And ever Love hears the womens sighing
And ever sweet knighthoods deathdefying
And ever wise childhoods deep implying
But never a traders glozing and lying

And yet shall Love himself be heard
Though long deferred though long deferred
Oer the modern waste a dove hath whirred
Music is Love in search of a word

My Springs



In the heart of the Hills of Life I know
Two springs that with unbroken flow
Forever pour their lucent streams
Into my souls far Lake of Dreams

Not larger than two eyes they lie
Beneath the manychanging sky
And mirror all of life and time
 Serene and dainty pantomime

Shot through with lights of stars and dawns
And shadowed sweet by ferns and fawns
 Thus heaven and earth together vie
Their shining depths to sanctify

Always when the large Form of Love
Is hid by storms that rage above
I gaze in my two springs and see
Love in his very verity

Always when Faith with stifling stress
Of grief hath died in bitterness
I gaze in my two springs and see
A Faith that smiles immortally

Always when Charity and Hope
In darkness bounden feebly grope
I gaze in my two springs and see
A Light that sets my captives free

Always when Art on perverse wing
Flies where I cannot hear him sing
I gaze in my two springs and see
A charm that brings him back to me

When Labor faints and Glory fails
And coy Reward in sighs exhales
I gaze in my two springs and see
Attainment full and heavenly

O Love O Wife thine eyes are they
 My springs from out whose shining gray
Issue the sweet celestial streams
That feed my lifes bright Lake of Dreams

Oval and large and passionpure
And gray and wise and honorsure
Soft as a dying violetbreath
Yet calmly unafraid of death

Thronged like two dovecotes of gray doves
With wifes and mothers and poorfolks loves
And homeloves and high gloryloves
And scienceloves and storyloves

And loves for all that God and man
In art and nature make or plan
And ladyloves for spidery lace
And broideries and supple grace

And diamonds and the whole sweet round
Of littles that large life compound
And loves for God and Gods bare truth
And loves for Magdalen and Ruth

Dear eyes dear eyes and rare complete 
Being heavenlysweet and earthlysweet
 I marvel that God made you mine
For when He frowns tis then ye shine

In Absence



 I

The storm that snapped our fates one ship in twain
 Hath blown my half o the wreck from thine apart
O Love O Love across the graywaved main
 To theeward strain my eyes my arms my heart
I ask my God if een in His sweet place
 Where by one waving of a wistful wing
My soul could straightway tremble face to face
 With thee with thee across the stellar ring 
Yea where thine absence I could neer bewail
 Longer than lasts that little blank of bliss
When lips draw back with recent pressure pale
 To round and redden for another kiss 
 Would not my lonesome heart still sigh for thee
 What time the drear kissintervals must be


 II

So do the mottled formulas of Sense
 Glide snakewise through our dreams of Aftertime
So errors breed in reeds and grasses dense
 That bank our singing rivulets of rhyme
By Sense rule Space and Time but in Gods Land
 Their intervals are not save such as lie
Betwixt successive tones in concords bland
 Whose loving distance makes the harmony
Ah there shall never come twixt me and thee
 Gross dissonances of the mile the year
But in the multichords of ecstasy
 Our souls shall mingle yet be featured clear
 And absence wrought to intervals divine
 Shall part yet link thy natures tone and mine


 III

Look down the shining peaks of all my days
 Basehidden in the valleys of deep night
So shalt thou see the heights and depths of praise
 My love would render unto loves delight
For I would make each day an Alp sublime
 Of passionate snow whitehot yet icyclear
 One crystal of the trueloves of all time
 Spiring the worlds prismatic atmosphere
And I would make each night an awful vale
 Deep as thy soul obscure as modesty
With every star in heaven trembling pale
 Oer sweet profounds where only Love can see
 Oh runs not thus the lesson thou hast taught 
 When lifes all love tis life aught else tis naught


 IV

Let no man say He at his ladys feet
 Lays worship that to Heaven alone belongs
Yea swings the incense that for God is meet
 In flippant censers of light lovers songs
Who says it knows not God nor love nor thee
 For love is large as is yon heavenly dome
In loves great blue each passion is full free
 To fly his favorite flight and build his home
Did eer a lark with skywardpointing beak
 Stab by mischance a levelflying dove
Wifelove flies level his dear mate to seek
 Godlove darts straight into the skies above
 Crossing the windage of each others wings
 But speeds them both upon their journeyings

Acknowledgment



 I

O Age that half believst thou half believst
 Half doubtst the substance of thine own half doubt
And half perceiving that thou half perceivst
 Standst at thy temple door heart in head out
Lo while thy hearts within helping the choir
 Without thine eyes range up and down the time
Blinking at oerbright science smit with desire
 To see and not to see Hence crime on crime
Yea if the Christ called thine now paced yon street
 Thy halfness hot with His rebuke would swell
Legions of scribes would rise and run and beat
 His fair intolerable Wholeness twice to hell
 Nay so dear Heart thou whisperest in my soul
 Tis a half time yet Time will make it whole


 II

Now at thy soft recalling voice I rise
 Where thought is lord oer Times complete estate
Like as a dove from out the gray sedge flies
 To treetops green where cooes his heavenly mate
From these clear coverts high and cool I see
 How every time with every time is knit
And each to all is mortised cunningly
 And none is sole or whole yet all are fit
Thus if this Age but as a comma show
 Twixt weightier clauses of largeworded years
My calmer soul scorns not the mark I know
 This crooked point Times complex sentence clears
 Yet more I learn while Friend I sit by thee
 Who sees all time sees all eternity


 III

If I do ask How God can dumbness keep
 While Sin creeps grinning through His house of Time
Stabbing His saintliest children in their sleep
 And staining holy walls with clots of crime 
Or How may He whose wish but names a fact
 Refuse what misersscanting of supply
Would richly glut each void where man hath lacked
 Of grace or bread  or How may Power deny
Wholeness to th almostfolk that hurt our hope 
 These heartbreak Hamlets who so barely fail
In life or art that but a hairs more scope
 Had set them fair on heights they neer may scale 
 Somehow by thee dear Love I win content
 Thy Perfect stops th Imperfects argument


 IV

By the more height of thy sweet stature grown
 Twiceeyed with thy gray vision set in mine
I ken far lands to wifeless men unknown
 I compass stars for onesexed eyes too fine
No text on seahorizons cloudily writ
 No maxim vaguely starred in fields or skies
But this wise thouinme deciphers it
 Oh thourt the Height of heights the Eye of eyes
Not hardest Fortunes most unbounded stress
 Can blind my soul nor hurl it from on high
Possessing thee the self of loftiness
 And very light that Light discovers by
 Howeer thou turnst wrong Earth still Loves in sight
 For we are taller than the breadth of night

Laus Mariae



Across the brook of Time man leaping goes
 On steppingstones of epochs that uprise
Fixed memorable midst broad shallow flows
 Of neutrals killtimes sleeps indifferencies
So twixt each morn and night rise salient heaps
 Some cross with but a zigzag jaded pace
From meal to meal some with convulsive leaps
 Shake the green tussocks of malign disgrace
And some advance by system and deep art
 Oer vantages of wealth place learning tact
But thou within thyself dear manifold heart
 Dost bind all epochs in one dainty Fact
 Oh sweet my pretty sum of history
 I leapt the breadth of Time in loving thee

Special Pleading



Time hurry my Love to me
Haste haste Lovst not good company
 Heres but a heartbreak sandy waste
 Twixt Now and Then Why killing haste
Were best dear Time for thee for thee

Oh would that I might divine
Thy name beyond the zodiac sign
 Wherefrom our timestocome descend
 He called thee Sometime Change it friend
Nowtime sounds so much more fine

Sweet Sometime fly fast to me
Poor Nowtime sits in the Lonesometree
 And broods as gray as any dove
 And calls When wilt thou come O Love
And pleads across the waste to thee

Good Moment that givst him me
Wast ever in love Maybe maybe
 Thoult be this heavenly velvet time
 When Day and Night as rhyme and rhyme
Set lip to lip duskmodestly

Or haply some noon afar
 O lifes top bud mixt rose and star
 How ever can thine utmost sweet
 Be starconsummate rosecomplete
Till thy rich reds full opened are

Well be it dusktime or noontime
I ask but one small boon Time
 Come thou in night come thou in day
 I care not I care not have thine own way
But only but only come soon Time

The Bee



What time I paced at pleasant morn
 A deep and dewy wood
I heard a mellow huntinghorn
 Make dim report of Dians lustihood
Far down a heavenly hollow
Mine ear though fain had pain to follow
 Tara it twanged taratara it blew
 Yet wavered oft and flew
Most ficklewise about or here or there
A music now from earth and now from air
 But on a sudden lo
 I marked a blossom shiver to and fro
With dainty inward storm and there within
A downdrawn trump of yellow jessamine
 A bee
 Thrust up its sadgold body lustily
All in a honey madness hotly bound
 On blissful burglary
 A cunning sound
In that wingmusic held me down I lay
In amber shades of many a golden spray
Where looping low with languid arms the Vine
In wreaths of ravishment did overtwine
Her kneeling LiveOak thousandfold to plight
Herself unto her own true stalwart knight

As some dim blur of distant music nears
The longdesiring sense and slowly clears
 To forms of time and apprehensive tune
 So as I lay full soon
Interpretation throve the bees fanfare
Through sequent films of discourse vague as air
Passed to plain words while fanning faint perfume
The bee oerhung a rich unrifled bloom
 O Earth fair lordly Blossom soft ashine
 Upon the starpranked universal vine
 Hast nought for me
 To thee
 Come I a poet hereward haply blown
 From out another worldflower lately flown
Wilt ask What profit eer a poet brings
He beareth starry stuff about his wings
To pollen thee and sting thee fertile nay
If still thou narrow thy contracted way
  Worldflower if thou refuse me 
  Worldflower if thou abuse me
 And hoist thy stamens spearpoint high
 To wound my wing and mar mine eye 
Nathless Ill drive me to thy deepest sweet
Yea richlier shall that pain the pollen beat
From me to thee for oft these pollens be
Fine dust from wars that poets wage for thee
But O beloved Earthbloom soft ashine
Upon the universal Jessamine
 Prithee abuse me not
 Prithee refuse me not
Yield yield the heartsome honey love to me
 Hid in thy nectary
And as I sank into a dimmer dream
The pleading bees songburthen sole did seem
 Hast neer a honeydrop of love for me
 In thy huge nectary

The Harlequin of Dreams



Swift through some trap mine eyes have never found
 Dimpanelled in the painted scene of Sleep
 Thou giant Harlequin of Dreams dost leap
Upon my spirits stage Then Sight and Sound
Then Space and Time then Language Mete and Bound
 And all familiar Forms that firmly keep
 Mans reason in the road change faces peep
Betwixt the legs and mock the daily round
Yet thou canst more than mock sometimes my tears
 At midnight break through bounden lids  a sign
 Thou hast a heart and oft thy little leaven
Of dreamtaught wisdom works me bettered years
 In one night witch saint trickster fool divine
 I think thourt Jester at the Court of Heaven

Street Cries

 Oft seems the Time a markettown
 Where many merchantspirits meet
 Who up and down and up and down
 Cry out along the street

 Their needs as wares one THUS one SO
 Till all the ways are full of sound
  But still come rain and sun and snow
 And still the world goes round



 I Remonstrance


 Opinion let me alone I am not thine
Prim Creed with categoric point forbear
 To feature me my Lord by rule and line
Thou canst not measure Mistress Natures hair
 Not one sweet inch nay if thy sight is sharp
 Wouldst count the strings upon an angels harp
 Forbear forbear

 Oh let me love my Lord more fathom deep
Than there is line to sound with let me love
 My fellow not as men that mandates keep
Yea all thats lovable below above
 That let me love by heart by heart because
 Free from the penal pressure of the laws
 I find it fair

 The tears I weep by day and bitter night
Opinion for thy sole salt vintage fall
  As morn by morn I rise with fresh delight
Time through my casement cheerily doth call
 Nature is new tis birthday every day
 Come feast with me let no man say me nay
 Whateer befall

 So fare I forth to feast I sit beside
Some brother bright but ere goodmorrows passed
 Burly Opinion wedging in hath cried
Thou shalt not sit by us to break thy fast
 Save to our Rubric thou subscribe and swear 
 Religion hath blue eyes and yellow hair
 Shes Saxon all

 Then hard ahungered for my brothers grace
Till wellnigh fain to swear his follys true
 In sad dissent I turn my longing face
To him that sits on the left Brother  with you
  Nay not with me save thou subscribe and swear
 Religion hath black eyes and raven hair
 Nought else is true

 Debarred of banquets that my heart could make
With every man on every day of life
 I homeward turn my fires of pain to slake
In deep endearments of a worshipped wife
 I love thee well dear Love quoth she and yet
 Would that thy creed with mine completely met
 As one not two

 Assassin Thief Opinion tis thy work
By Church by throne by hearth by every good
 Thats in the Town of Time I see thee lurk
And eer some shadow stays where thou hast stood
 Thou handst sweet Socrates his hemlock sour
 Thou savst Barabbas in that hideous hour
 And stabbst the good

 Deliverer Christ thou rackst the souls of men
Thou tossest girls to lions and boys to flames
 Thou hewst Crusader down by Saracen
Thou buildest closets full of secret shames
 Indifferent cruel thou dost blow the blaze
 Round Ridley or Servetus all thy days
 Smell scorched I would

  Thou baseborn Accident of time and place 
Bigot Pretender unto Judgments throne 
 Bastard that claimest with a cunning face
Those rights the true true Son of Man doth own
 By Loves authority  thou Rebel cold
 At head of civil wars and quarrels old 
 Thou Knife on a throne 

 I would thou leftst me free to live with love
And faith that through the love of love doth find
 My Lords dear presence in the stars above
The clods below the flesh without the mind
 Within the bread the tear the smile
 Opinion damned Intriguer gray with guile
 Let me alone

 II The Ship of Earth


Thou Ship of Earth with Death and Birth and Life and Sex aboard
 And fires of Desires burning hotly in the hold
I fear thee O I fear thee for I hear the tongue and sword
 At battle on the deck and the wild mutineers are bold

The dewdrop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky
 But all the deck is wet with blood and stains the crystal red
A pilot GOD a pilot for the helm is left awry
 And the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead

 III How Love Looked for Hell


To heal his heart of longtime pain
One day Prince Love for to travel was fain
 With Ministers Mind and Sense
Now what to thee most strange may be
Quoth Mind and Sense All things above
One curious thing I first would see 
 Hell quoth Love

Then Mind rode in and Sense rode out
They searched the ways of man about
 First frightfully groaneth Sense
Tis here tis here and spurreth in fear
To the top of the hill that hangeth above
And plucketh the Prince Come come tis here 
 Where quoth Love 

Not far not far said shivering Sense
As they rode on A short way hence
  But seventy paces hence
Look King dost see where suddenly
This road doth dip from the height above
Cold blew a mouldy wind by me
 Cold quoth Love

As I rode down and the River was black
And yonside lo an endless wrack
 And rabble of souls sighed Sense
Their eyes upturned and begged and burned
In brimstone lakes and a Hand above
Beat back the hands that upward yearned 
 Nay quoth Love 

Yea yea sweet Prince thyself shalt see
Wilt thou but down this slope with me
 Tis palpable whispered Sense
 At the foot of the hill a living rill
Shone and the lilies shone white above
But now twas black twas a river this rill
 Black quoth Love

Ay black but lo the lilies grow
And yonside where was woe was woe
  Where the rabble of souls cried Sense
Did shrivel and turn and beg and burn
Thrust back in the brimstone from above 
Is banked of violet rose and fern
 How quoth Love

For lakes of pain yon pleasant plain
Of woods and grass and yellow grain
 Doth ravish the soul and sense
And never a sigh beneath the sky
And folk that smile and gaze above 
But sawst thou here with thine own eye
 Hell quoth Love

I saw true hell with mine own eye
True hell or light hath told a lie
 True verily quoth stout Sense
Then Love rode round and searched the ground
The caves below the hills above
But I cannot find where thou hast found
 Hell quoth Love

There while they stood in a green wood
And marvelled still on Ill and Good
 Came suddenly Minister Mind
In the heart of sin doth hell begin
Tis not below tis not above
It lieth within it lieth within
 Where quoth Love

I saw a man sit by a corse
Hells in the murderers breast remorse
 Thus clamored his mind to his mind
Not fleshly dole is the sinners goal
Hells not below nor yet above
Tis fixed in the everdamned soul 
 Fixed quoth Love 

Fixed follow me wouldst thou but see
He weepeth under yon willow tree
 Fast chained to his corse quoth Mind
Full soon they passed for they rode fast
Where the piteous willow bent above
Now shall I see at last at last
 Hell quoth Love

There when they came Mind suffered shame
These be the same and not the same
 Awondering whispered Mind
Lo face by face two spirits pace
Where the blissful willow waves above
One saith Do me a friendly grace 
 Grace quoth Love

Read me two Dreams that linger long
Dim as returns of oldtime song
 That flicker about the mind
I dreamed how deep in mortal sleep
I struck thee dead then stood above
With tears that none but dreamers weep
 Dreams quoth Love

In dreams again I plucked a flower
That clung with pain and stung with power
 Yea nettled me body and mind
Twas the nettle of sin twas medicine
No need nor seed of it here Above
In dreams of hate true loves begin
 True quoth Love

Now strange quoth Sense and Strange quoth Mind
We saw it and yet tis hard to find
  But we saw it quoth Sense and Mind
Stretched on the ground beautifulcrowned
Of the piteous willow that wreathed above
But I cannot find where ye have found
 Hell quoth Love

 IV Tyranny


 Springgerms springgerms
I charge you by your life go back to death
This glebe is sick this wind is foul of breath
 Stay feed the worms

 Oh every clod
Is faint and falters from the war of growth
And crumbles in a dreary dust of sloth
 Unploughed untrod

 What need what need
To hide with flowers the curse upon the hills
Or sanctify the banks of sluggish rills
 Where vapors breed

 And  if needs must 
Advance O Summerheats upon the land
And bake the bloody mould to shards and sand
 And dust

 Before your birth
Burn up O Roses with your dainty flame
Good Violets sweet Violets hide shame
 Below the earth

 Ye silent Mills
Reject the bitter kindness of the moss
O Farms protest if any tree emboss
 The barren hills

 Young Trade is dead
And swart Work sullen sits in the hillside fern
And folds his arms that find no bread to earn
 And bows his head

 Springgerms springgerms
Albeit the towns have left you place to play
I charge you sport not Winter owns today
 Stay feed the worms

 V Life and Song


If life were caught by a clarionet
 And a wild heart throbbing in the reed
Should thrill its joy and trill its fret
 And utter its heart in every deed

Then would this breathing clarionet
 Type what the poet fain would be
For none o the singers ever yet
 Has wholly lived his minstrelsy

Or clearly sung his true true thought
 Or utterly bodied forth his life
Or out of life and song has wrought
 The perfect one of man and wife

Or lived and sung that Life and Song
 Might each express the others all
Careless if life or art were long
 Since both were one to stand or fall

So that the wonder struck the crowd
 Who shouted it about the land
His song was only living aloud
 His work a singing with his hand

 VI To Richard Wagner


I saw a sky of stars that rolled in grime
 All glory twinkled through some sweat of fight
From each tall chimney of the roaring time
 That shot his fire far up the sooty night
Mixt fuels  Labors Right and Labors Crime 
 Sent upward throb on throb of scarlet light
Till huge hot blushes in the heavens blent
 With golden hues of Trades high firmament

Fierce burned the furnaces yet all seemed well
 Hope dreamed rich music in the rattling mills
Ye foundries ye shall cast my church a bell
 Loud cried the Future from the farthest hills
Ye groaning forces crack me every shell
 Of customs old constraints and narrow ills
Thou lithe Invention wake and pry and guess
 Till thy deft mind invents me Happiness

And I beheld high scaffoldings of creeds
 Crumbling from round Religions perfect Fane
And a vast noise of rights wrongs powers needs
  Cries of new Faiths that called This Way is plain
 Grindings of upper against lower greeds 
  Fond sighs for old things shouts for new  did reign
Below that stream of golden fire that broke
 Mottled with red above the seas of smoke

Hark Gay fanfares from halls of old Romance
 Strike through the clouds of clamor who be these
That paired in rich processional advance
 From darkness oer the murk mad factories
Into yon flaming road and sink strange Ministrants
 Sheer down to earth with many minstrelsies
And motions fine and mix about the scene
 And fill the Time with forms of ancient mien

Bright ladies and brave knights of Fatherland
 Sad mariners no harbor eer may hold
A swan soft floating towrds a magic strand
 Dim ghosts of earth air water fire steel gold
Wind grief and love a lewd and lurking band
 Of Powers  dark Conspiracy Cunning cold
Gray Sorcery magic cloaks and rings and rods
 Valkyries heroes Rhinemaids giants gods

     

O Wagner westward bring thy heavenly art
 No trifler thou Siegfried and Wotan be
Names for big ballads of the modern heart
 Thine ears hear deeper than thine eyes can see
Voice of the monstrous mill the shouting mart
 Not less of airy cloud and wave and tree
Thou thou if even to thyself unknown
 Hast power to say the Time in terms of tone

 VII A Song of Love


 Hey rose just born
 Twin to a thorn
Wast so with you O Love and Scorn

 Sweet eyes that smiled
 Now wet and wild
O Eye and Tear  mother and child

 Well Love and Pain
 Be kinsfolk twain
Yet would Oh would I could love again




To Beethoven



In oerstrict calyx lingering
 Lay musics bud too long unblown
Till thou Beethoven breathed the spring
 Then bloomed the perfect rose of tone

O Psalmist of the weak the strong
 O Troubadour of love and strife
CoLitanist of right and wrong
 Sole Hymner of the whole of life

I know not how I care not why 
 Thy music sets my world at ease
And melts my passions mortal cry
 In satisfying symphonies

It soothes my accusations sour
 Gainst thoughts that fray the restless soul
The stain of death the pain of power
 The lack of love twixt part and whole

The yeanay of Freewill and Fate
 Whereof both cannot be yet are
The praise a poet wins too late
 Who starves from earth into a star

The lies that serve great parties well
 While truths but give their Christ a cross
The loves that send warm souls to hell
 While coldblood neuters take no loss

Th indifferent smile that natures grace
 On Jesus Judas pours alike
Th indifferent frown on natures face
 When luminous lightnings strangely strike

The sailor praying on his knees
 And spare his mate thats cursing God
How babes and widows starve and freeze
 Yet Nature will not stir a clod

Why Nature blinds us in each act
 Yet makes no law in mercy bend
No pitfall from our feet retract
 No storm cry out Take shelter friend

Why snakes that crawl the earth should ply
 Rattles that whoso hears may shun
While serpent lightnings in the sky
 But rattle when the deed is done

How truth can eer be good for them
 That have not eyes to bear its strength
And yet how stern our lights condemn
 Delays that lend the darkness length

To know all things save knowingness
 To grasp yet loosen feelings rein
To waste no manhood on success
 To look with pleasure upon pain

Though teased by small mixt social claims
 To lose no large simplicity
And midst of clearseen crimes and shames
 To move with manly purity

To hold with keen yet loving eyes
 Arts realm from Cleverness apart
To know the Clever good and wise
 Yet haunt the lonesome heights of Art

O Psalmist of the weak the strong
 O Troubadour of love and strife
CoLitanist of right and wrong
 Sole Hymner of the whole of life

I know not how I care not why
 Thy music brings this broil at ease
And melts my passions mortal cry
 In satisfying symphonies

Yea it forgives me all my sins
 Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme
And tunes the task each day begins
 By the last trumpetnote of Time

An Frau Nannette FalkAuerbach



Als du im Saal mit deiner himmlischen Kunst
 Beethoven zeigst und seinem Willen nach
Mit den zehn Fingern fuehrst der Leute Gunst
 Zehn Zungen sagen was der Meister sprach
Schauend dich an ich seh dass nicht allein
 Du sitzest jetzt herab die Toene ziehn
Beethovens Geist er steht bei dir ganz rein
 Fuer dich mit Vaters Stolz sein Augen gluehn
Er sagt Ich hoerte dich aus Himmelsluft
 Die kommt ja naeher wo ein Kuenstler spielt
Mein Kind ich sagte mich zur Erde ruft
 Ja weil mein Arm kein Kind im Leben hielt
 Gott hat mir dich nach meinem Tod gegeben
 Nannette Tochter dich mein zweites Leben

To Nannette FalkAuerbach



Oft as I hear thee wrapt in heavenly art
 The massive message of Beethoven tell
With thy ten fingers to the peoples heart
 As if ten tongues told news of heaven and hell 
Gazing on thee I mark that not alone
 Ah not alone thou sittest there by thee
Beethovens self dear living lord of tone
 Doth stand and smile upon thy mastery
Full fain and fatherly his great eyes glow
 He says From Heaven my child I heard thee call
For where an artist plays the sky is low
 Yea since my lonesome life did lack loves all
 In death God gives me thee thus quit of pain
 Daughter Nannette in thee I live again

To Our MockingBird

Died of a cat May 1878



 I

Trillets of humor  shrewdest whistlewit 
 Contralto cadences of grave desire
 Such as from off the passionate Indian pyre
Drift down through sandalodored flames that split
About the slim young widow who doth sit
 And sing above  midnights of tone entire 
 Tissues of moonlight shot with songs of fire 
Bright drops of tune from oceans infinite
Of melody sipped off the thinedged wave
And trickling down the beak  discourses brave
 Of serious matter that no man may guess 
 Goodfellow greetings cries of light distress 
 All these but now within the house we heard
 O Death wast thou too deaf to hear the bird


 II

Ah me though never an ear for song thou hast
 A tireless tooth for songsters thus of late
 Thou camest Death thou Cat and leapst my gate
And long ere Love could follow thou hadst passed
Within and snatched away how fast how fast
 My bird  wit songs and all  thy richest freight
 Since that fell time when in some wink of fate
Thy yellow claws unsheathed and stretched and cast
Sharp hold on Keats and dragged him slow away
And harried him with hope and horrid play 
 Ay him the worlds best woodbird wise with song 
 Till thou hadst wrought thine own last mortal wrong
 Twas wrong twas wrong I care not WRONGs the word 
 To munch our Keats and crunch our mockingbird


 III

Nay Bird my grief gainsays the Lords best right
 The Lord was fain at some late festal time
 That Keats should set all Heavens woods in rhyme
And thou in birdnotes Lo this tearful night
Methinks I see thee fresh from deaths despite
 Perched in a palmgrove wild with pantomime
 Oer blissful companies couched in shady thyme
 Methinks I hear thy silver whistlings bright
Mix with the mighty discourse of the wise
 Till broad Beethoven deaf no more and Keats
Midst of much talk uplift their smiling eyes
 And mark the music of thy woodconceits
 And halfway pause on some large courteous word
 And call thee Brother O thou heavenly Bird

The Dove



If haply thou O Desdemona Morn
 Shouldst call along the curving sphere Remain
Dear Night sweet Moor nay leave me not in scorn
 With soft halloos of heavenly love and pain 

Shouldst thou O Spring acower in coverts dark
 Gainst proud supplanting Summer sing thy plea
And move the mighty woods through mailed bark
 Till mortal heartbreak throbbed in every tree 

Or grievous if that may be yea oersoon
 If thou my Heart long holden from thy Sweet
Shouldst knock Deaths door with mellow shocks of tune
 Sad inquiry to make  When may we meet

Nay if ye three O Morn O Spring O Heart
 Should chant grave unisons of grief and love
Ye could not mourn with more melodious art
 Than daily doth yon dim sequestered dove

To  with a Rose



 I asked my heart to say
Some word whose worth my loves devoir might pay
 Upon my Ladys natal day

 Then said my heart to me
Learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee
 What fits thy Love most lovingly

 This gift that learning shows
For as a rhyme unto its rhymetwin goes
 I send a rose unto a Rose

On Huntingdons Miranda



The storm hath blown thee a lover sweet
And laid him kneeling at thy feet
But  guerdon rich for favor rare
The wind hath all thy holy hair
To kiss and to sing through and to flare
Like torchflames in the passionate air
 About thee O Miranda

Eyes in a blaze eyes in a daze
Bold with love cold with amaze
Chastethrilling eyes fastfilling eyes
With daintiest tears of loves surprise
Ye draw my soul unto your blue
As warm skies draw the exhaling dew
 Divine eyes of Miranda

And if I were yon stolid stone
Thy tender arm doth lean upon
Thy touch would turn me to a heart
And I would palpitate and start
 Content when thou wert gone to be
A dumb rock by the lonesome sea
 Forever O Miranda

Ode to the Johns Hopkins University

Read on the Fourth Commemoration Day February 1880



 How tall among her sisters and how fair 
How grave beyond her youth yet debonair
As dawn mid wrinkled Matres of old lands
Our youngest Alma Mater modest stands
In four brief cycles round the punctual sun
Has she old Learnings latest daughter won
This grace this stature and this fruitful fame
 Howbeit she was born
 Unnoised as any stealing summer morn
From far the sages saw from far they came
And ministered to her
Led by the soaringgeniusd Sylvester
That earlier loosed the knot great Newton tied
And flung the door of Fames locked temple wide
As favorable fairies thronged of old and blessed
The cradled princess with their several best
 So gifts and dowers meet
 To lay at Wisdoms feet
These liberal masters largely brought 
Dear diamonds of their longcompressed thought
Rich stones from out the labyrinthine cave
Of research pearls from Times profoundest wave
And many a jewel brave of brilliant ray
 Dug in the far obscure Cathay
 Of meditation deep 
With flowers of such as keep
Their fragrant tissues and their heavenly hues
Freshbathed forever in eternal dews 
 The violet with her lowdrooped eye
 For learned modesty 
The student snowdrop that doth hang and pore
Upon the earth like Science evermore
And underneath the clod doth grope and grope 
 The astronomer heliotrope
That watches heaven with a constant eye 
The daring crocus unafraid to try
When Nature calls the February snows 
 And patience perfect rose
Thus sped with helps of love and toil and thought
Thus forwarded of faith with hope thus fraught
In four brief cycles round the stringent sun
This youngest sister hath her stature won

 Nay why regard
The passing of the years Nor made nor marrd
By help or hindrance of slow Time was she
Oer this fair growth Time had no mastery
So quick she bloomed she seemed to bloom at birth
As Eve from Adam or as he from earth
Superb oer slow increase of day on day
Complete as Pallas she began her way
Yet not from Joves unwrinkled forehead sprung
But longtime dreamed and out of trouble wrung
Foreseen wiseplannd pure child of thought and pain
Leapt our Minerva from a mortal brain

And here O finer Pallas long remain 
Sit on these Maryland hills and fix thy reign
And frame a fairer Athens than of yore
 In these blest bounds of Baltimore 
 Here where the climates meet
That each may make the others lack complete 
Where Floridas soft Favonian airs beguile
The nipping North  where natures powers smile 
Where Chesapeake holds frankly forth her hands
Spread wide with invitation to all lands 
Where now the eager people yearn to find
The organizing hand that fast may bind
Loose straws of aimless aspiration fain
 In sheaves of serviceable grain 
 Here old and new in one
Through nobler cycles round a richer sun
 Oerrule our modern ways
O blest Minerva of these larger days
Call here thy congress of the great the wise
The hearing ears the seeing eyes 
Enrich us out of every farthest clime 
Yea make all ages native to our time
 Till thou the freedom of the city grant
 To each most antique habitant
 Of Fame 
Bring Shakespeare back a man and not a name 
Let every player that shall mimic us
In audience see old godlike Aeschylus 
Bring Homer Dante Plato Socrates 
Bring Virgil from the visionary seas
Of old romance  bring Milton no more blind 
Bring large Lucretius with unmaniac mind 
Bring all gold hearts and high resolved wills
To be with us about these happy hills 
 Bring old Renown
To walk familiar citizen of the town 
Bring Tolerance that can kiss and disagree 
Bring Virtue Honor Truth and Loyalty 
Bring Faith that sees with undissembling eyes 
Bring all large Loves and heavenly Charities 
Till man seem less a riddle unto man
And fair Utopia less Utopian
And many peoples call from shore to shore
The world has bloomed again at Baltimore

Martha Washington

Written for the Martha Washington Court Journal



Down cold snowstretches of our bitter time
 When windy shams and the rainmocking sleet
Of Trade have cased us in such icy rime
 That hearts are scarcely hot enough to beat
Thy fame O Lady of the lofty eyes
 Doth fall along the age like as a lane
Of Spring in whose most generous boundaries
 Full many a frozen virtue warms again
Today I saw the pale muchburdened form
 Of Charity come limping oer the line
And straighten from the bending of the storm
 And flush with stirrings of new strength divine
Such influence and sweet gracious impulse came
Out of the beams of thine immortal name

Psalm of the West



Land of the willful gospel thou worst and thou best
Tall Adam of lands newmade of the dust of the West
Thou wroughtest alone in the Garden of God unblest
Till He fashioned lithe Freedom to lie for thine Eve on thy breast 
 Till out of thy hearts dear neighborhood out of thy side
 He fashioned an intimate Sweet one and brought thee a Bride
 Cry hail nor bewail that the wound of her coming was wide
Lo Freedom reached forth where the world as an apple hung red
Let us taste the whole radiant round of it gayly she said
If we die at the worst we shall lie as the first of the dead
 Knowledge of Good and of Ill O Land she hath given thee
 Perilous godhoods of choosing have rent thee and riven thee
 Wills high adoring to Ills low exploring hath driven thee 
 Freedom thy Wife hath uplifted thy life and clean shriven thee
Her shalt thou clasp for a balm to the scars of thy breast
Her shalt thou kiss for a calm to thy wars of unrest
Her shalt extol in the psalm of the soul of the West
 For Weakness in freedom grows stronger than Strength with a chain
 And Error in freedom will come to lamenting his stain
 Till freely repenting he whiten his spirit again
And Friendship in freedom will blot out the bounding of race
And straight Law in freedom will curve to the rounding of grace
And Fashion in freedom will die of the lie in her face
 And Desire flame white on the sense as a fire on a height
 And Sex flame white in the soul as a star in the night
 And Marriage plight sense unto soul as the twocolored light
 Of the fire and the star shines one with a duplicate might
And Science be known as the sense making love to the All
And Art be known as the soul making love to the All
And Love be known as the marriage of man with the All 
 Till Science to knowing the Highest shall lovingly turn
 Till Art to loving the Highest shall consciously burn
 Till Science to Art as a man to a woman shall yearn
  Then morn
When Faith from the wedding of Knowing and Loving shall purely be born
And the Child shall smile in the West and the West to the East give morn
And the Time in that ultimate Prime shall forget old regretting and scorn
Yea the stream of the light shall give off in a shimmer
 the dream of the night forlorn

 Once on a time a soul
 Too full of his dole
In a querulous dream went crying from pole to pole 
 Went sobbing and crying
 For ever a sorrowful song of living and dying
 How life was the dropping and death the drying
 Of a Tear that fell in a day when God was sighing
And ever Time tossed him bitterly to and fro
As a shuttle inlaying a perilous warp of woe
In the woof of things from terminal snow to snow
 Till lo
 Rest
And he sank on the grass of the earth as a lark on its nest
And he lay in the midst of the way from the east to the west
Then the East came out from the east and the West from the west
 And behold in the gravid deeps of the lower dark
 While above the wind was fanning the dawn as a spark
 The East and the West took form as the wings of a lark
One wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost Past
And one with the dreams of a prophet and both sailed fast
And met where the sorrowful Soul on the earth was cast
 Then a Voice said Thine if thou lovest enough to use
 But another To fly and to sing is pain refuse
 Then the Soul said Come O my wings I cannot but choose
And the Soul was atremble like as a newborn thing
Till the spark of the dawn wrought a conscience in heart as in wing
Saying Thou art the lark of the dawn it is time to sing

Then that artist began in a larks low circling to pass
And first he sang at the height of the top of the grass
A song of the herds that are born and die in the mass
 And next he sang a celestialpassionate round
 At the height of the lips of a woman above the ground
 How Love was a fair true Lady and Death a wild hound
 And she called and he licked her hand and with girdle was bound
And then with a universelove he was hot in the wings
And the sun stretched beams to the worlds as the shining strings
Of the large hid harp that sounds when an alllover sings
 And the skys blue traction prevailed oer the earths in might
 And the passion of flight grew mad with the glory of height
 And the uttering of song was like to the giving of light
And he learned that hearing and seeing wrought nothing alone
And that music on earth much light upon Heaven had thrown
And he meltedin silvery sunshine with silvery tone
 And the spirals of music eer higher and higher he wound
 Till the luminous cinctures of melody up from the ground
 Arose as the shaft of a tapering tower of sound 
 Arose for an unstricken fullfinished Babel of sound
But God was not angry nor ever confused his tongue
For not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung
The song of all men and all things that the alllover sung
 Then he paused at the top of his tower of song on high
 And the voice of the God of the artist from far in the sky
Said Son look down I will cause that a Time gone by
Shall pass and reveal his heart to thy loving eye

 Far spread below
The sea that fast hath locked in his loose flow
All secrets of Atlantis drowned woe
 Lay bound about with night on every hand
 Save down the eastern brink a shining band
 Of day made out a little way from land
Then from that shore the wind upbore a cry
Thou Sea thou Sea of Darkness why oh why
Dost waste thy West in unthrift mystery
 But ever the idiot seamouths foam and fill
 And never a wave doth good for man or ill
 And Blank is king and Nothing hath his will
And like as grimbeaked pelicans level file
Across the sunset toward their nightly isle
On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile
 So leanly sails the day behind the day
 To where the Pasts lone Rock oerglooms the spray
 And down its mortal fissures sinks away

 Master Master break this ban
 The wave lacks Thee
 Oh is it not to widen man
 Stretches the sea
 Oh must the seabirds idle van
 Alone be free

 Into the Sea of the Dark doth creep
 Bjoernes pallid sail
 As the face of a walker in his sleep
 Set rigid and most pale
 About the night doth peer and peep
 In a dream of an ancient tale

 Lo here is made a hasty cry
 Land land upon the west 
 God save such land Go by go by
 Here may no mortal rest
 Where this waste hell of slate doth lie
 And grind the glaciers breast

 The sail goeth limp hey flap and strain
 Round eastward slanteth the mast
 As the sleepwalker waked with pain
 Whiteclothed in the midnight blast
 Doth stare and quake and stride again
 To houseward all aghast

 Yet as A ghost his household cry
 He hath followed a ghost in flight
 Let us see the ghost  his household fly
 With lamps to search the night 
 So Norsemens sails run out and try
 The Sea of the Dark with light

 Stout Are Marson southward whirled
 From out the tempests hand
 Doth skip the sloping of the world
 To Huitramannaland
 Where Georgias oaks with mossbeards curled
 Wave by the shining strand

 And sway in sighs from Floridas Spring
 Or Carolinas Palm 
 What time the mockingbird doth bring
 The woods his artistsbalm
 Singing the Song of Everything
 Consummatesweet and calm 

 Land of large mercifulhearted skies
 Big bounties rich increase
 Green rests for Trades bloodshotten eyes
 For oerbeat brains surcease
 For Love the dear woods sympathies
 For Grief the wise woods peace

 For Need rich givings of hid powers
 In hills and vales quickwon
 For Greed large exemplary flowers
 That neer have toiled nor spun
 For Heat fairtempered winds and showers
 For Cold the neighbor sun

 Land where the Spirits of JuneHeat
 From out their forestmaze
 Stray forth at eve with loitering feet
 And fervent hymns upraise
 In bland accord and passion sweet
 Along the Southern ways 

O Darkness tawny Twin whose Twin hath ceased
 Thou Odor from the dayflowers crushing born
Thou visible Sigh out of the mournful East
 That cannot see her lord again till morn
O Leaves with hollow palms uplifted high
 To catch the stars most sacred rain of light
O pallid Lilypetals fain to die
 Soulstung by subtle passion of the night
O shortbreathd Winds beneath the gracious moon
 Running mild errands for mild violets
Or carrying sighs from the red lips of June
 What wavering way the odorcurrent sets
O Stars wreathed vinewise round yon heavenly dells
 Or thrust from out the sky in curving sprays
Or whorled or looped with pendent flowerbells
 Or brambletangled in a brilliant maze
Or lying like young lilies in a lake
 About the great white Lily of the moon
Or drifting white from where in heaven shake
 Starportraitures of apple trees in June
Or lappd as leaves of a great rose of stars
 Or shyly clambering up cloudlattices
Or trampled pale in the red path of Mars
 Or trimset quaint in gardenersfantasies
O long June Nightsounds crooned among the leaves
 O whispered confidence of Dark and Green
O murmurs in old moss about old eaves
 O tinklings floating over watersheen

 Then Leif bold son of Eric the Red
 To the South of the West doth flee 
 Past slaty Helluland is sped
 Past Marklands woody lea
 Till round about fair Vinlands head
 Where Taunton helps the sea

 The Norseman calls the anchor falls
 The mariners hurry astrand
 They wassail with foredrunken skals
 Where prophet wild grapes stand
 They lift the Leifsbooths hasty walls
 They stride about the land 

 New England thee whose neerspent wine
 As blood doth stretch each vein
 And urge thee sinewed like thy vine
 Through peril and all pain
 To grasp Endeavors towering Pine
 And once ahold remain 

 Land where the strenuoushanded Wind
 With sarcasm of a friend
 Doth smite the man would lag behind
 To frontward of his end
 Yea where the taunting fall and grind
 Of Natures Ill doth send

 Such mortal challenge of a clown
 Rudethrust upon the soul
 That men but smile where mountains frown
 Or scowling waters roll
 And Natures front of battle down
 Do hurl from pole to pole

Now long the Sea of Darkness glimmers low
With sails from Northland flickering to and fro 
Thorwald Karlsefne and those twin heirs of woe
 Hellboge and Finnge in treasonable bed
 Slain by the illborn child of Eric Red
 Freydisa false Till as much time is fled
Once more the vacant airs with darkness fill
Once more the wave doth never good nor ill
And Blank is king and Nothing works his will
 And leanly sails the day behind the day
 To where the Pasts lone Rock oerglooms the spray
 And down its mortal fissures sinks away
As when the grimbeaked pelicans level file
Across the sunset to their seaward isle
On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile

 Master Master poets sing
 The Time calls Thee
 Yon Sea binds hard on everything
 Man longs to be
 Oh shall the seabirds aimless wing
 Alone move free

Santa Maria well thou tremblest down the wave
 Thy Pinta far abow thy Nina nigh astern
Columbus stands in the night alone and passing grave
 Yearns oer the sea as tones oer undersilence yearn
Heartens his heart as friend befriends his friend less brave
 Makes burn the faiths that cool and cools the doubts that burn 

 I

Twixt this and dawn three hours my soul will smite
 With prickly seconds or less tolerably
 With dullblade minutes flatwise slapping me
Wait Heart Time moves  Thou lithe young Western Night
Justcrowned king slow riding to thy right
 Would God that I might straddle mutiny
 Calm as thou sittst yon nevermanaged sea
Balkst with his balking fliest with his flight
Givst supple to his rearings and his falls
 Nor droppst one coronal star about thy brow
 Whilst ever dayward thou art steadfast drawn
Yea would I rode these mad contentious brawls
 No damage taking from their If and How
 Nor no result save galloping to my Dawn

 II

My Dawn my Dawn How if it never break
 How if this West by other Wests is pieced
 And these by vacant Wests on Wests increased 
One Pain of Space with hollow ache on ache
Throbbing and ceasing not for Christs own sake 
 Big perilous theorem hard for king and priest
 Pursue the West but long enough tis East
Oh if this watery world no turning take
 Oh if for all my logic all my dreams
 Provings of that which is by that which seems
Fears hopes chills heats hastes patiences droughts tears
Wifegrievings slights on love embezzled years
 Hates treaties scorns upliftings loss and gain 
 This earth no sphere be all one sickening plane

 III

Or haply how if this contrarious West
 That me by turns hath starved by turns hath fed
 Embraced disgraced beat back solicited
Have no fixed heart of Law within his breast
Or with some different rhythm doth eer contest
 Nature in the East Why tis but three weeks fled
 I saw my Judas needle shake his head
And flout the Pole that east he Lord confessed
 God if this West should own some other Pole
 And with his tangled ways perplex my soul
Until the maze grow mortal and I die
 Where distraught Nature clean hath gone astray
 On earth some other wit than Times at play
Some other God than mine above the sky

 IV

Now speaks mine other heart with cheerier seeming
 Ho Admiral oerdefalking to thy crew
 Against thyself thyself far overfew
To front yon multitudes of rebel scheming
Come ye wild twenty years of heavenly dreaming
 Come ye wild weeks since first this canvas drew
 Out of vexed Palos ere the dawn was blue
Oer milky waves about the bows fullcreaming
 Come set me round with many faithful spears
 Of confident remembrance  how I crushed
 Catlived rebellions pitfalled treasons hushed
Scared husbands heartbreak cries on distant wives
Made cowards blush at whining for their lives
 Watered my parching souls and dried their tears

 V

Ere we Gomera cleared a coward cried
 Turn turn here be three caravels ahead
 From Portugal to take us we are dead
Hold Westward pilot calmly I replied
So when the last land down the horizon died
 Go back go back they prayed our hearts are lead 
 Friends we are bound into the West I said
Then passed the wreck of a mast upon our side
See so they wept Gods Warning Admiral turn 
 Steersman I said hold straight into the West
Then down the night we saw the meteor burn
 So do the very heavens in fire protest
Good Admiral put about O Spain dear Spain 
Hold straight into the West I said again

 VI

Next drive we oer the slimyweeded sea
 Lo herebeneath another coward cries
 The cursed land of sunk Atlantis lies
This slime will suck us down  turn while thourt free 
But no I said Freedom bears West for me
 Yet when the longtime stagnant winds arise
 And day by day the keel to westward flies
My Good my peoples Ill doth come to be
 Ever the winds into the West do blow
 Never a ship once turned might homeward go
Meanwhile we speed into the lonesome main
 For Christs sake parley Admiral Turn before
We sail outside all bounds of help from pain 
 Our help is in the West I said once more

 VII

So when there came a mighty cry of Land
 And we clomb up and saw and shouted strong
 Salve Regina all the ropes along
But knew at morn how that a counterfeit band
Of level clouds had aped a silver strand
 So when we heard the orchardbirds small song
 And all the people cried A hellish throng
To tempt us onward by the Devil planned
Yea all from hell  keen heron fresh green weeds
Pelican tunnyfish fair tapering reeds
 Lietelling lands that ever shine and die
 In clouds of nothing round the empty sky
Tired Admiral get thee from this hell and rest 
Steersman I said hold straight into the West

 VIII

I marvel how mine eye ranging the Night
 From its big circling ever absently
 Returns thou large low Star to fix on thee
Maria Star No star a Light a Light
Wouldst leap ashore Heart Yonder burns  a Light
 Pedro Gutierrez wake come up to me
 I prithee stand and gaze about the sea
What seest Admiral like as land  a Light
Well Sanchez of Segovia come and try
What seest Admiral naught but sea and sky
 Well But I saw It Wait the Pintas gun
 Why look tis dawn the land is clear tis done
Two dawns do break at once from Times full hand 
Gods East  mine West good friends behold my Land

 Master Master faster fly
 Now the hurrying seasons by
 Now the Sea of Darkness wide
 Rolls in light from side to side
 Mark slow drifting to the West
 Down the trough and up the crest
 Yonder piteous heartsease petal
 Manymotioned rise and settle 
 Petal cast asea from land
 By the awkwardfingered Hand
 That mistaking Natures course
 Tears the love it fain would force 
 Petal calm of heartsease flower
 Smiling sweet on tempest sour
 Smiling where by crest and trough
 Heartache Winds at heartsease scoff
 Breathing mild perfumes of prayer
 Twixt the scolding sea and air

 Mayflower piteous Heartsease Petal
 Suavely down the seatroughs settle
 Gravely breathe perfumes of prayer
 Twixt the scolding sea and air
 Bravely up the seahills rise 
 Seahills slant thee toward the skies
 Master hold disaster off
 From the crest and from the trough
 Heartsease on the heartache sea
 God thy God will pilot thee

 Mayflower Ship of Faiths best Hope
 Thou art sure if all men grope
 Mayflower Ship of Hopes best Faith
 All is true the great God saith
 Mayflower Ship of Charity
 Love is Lord of land and sea
 Oh with love and loves best care
 Thy large godly freightage bear 
 Godly Hearts that Grails of gold
 Still the blood of Faith do hold

 Now bold Massachusetts clear
 Cuts the rounding of the sphere
 Out the anchor sail no more
 Lay us by the Futures shore 
 Not the shore we sought tis true
 But the time is come to do
 Leap dear Standish leap and wade
 Bradford Hopkins Tilley wade
 Leap and wade ashore and kneel 
 God be praised that steered the keel
 Home is good and soft is rest
 Even in this jagged West
 Freedom lives and Right shall stand
 Blood of Faith is in the land

Then in what time the primal icy years
Scraped slowly oer the Puritans hopes and fears
Like as great glaciers built of frozen tears
 The Voice from far within the secret sky
 Said Blood of Faith ye have So let us try
 And presently
 The anxiousmasted ships that westward fare
 Cargod with trouble and alist with care
 Their outraged decks hot back to England bear
 Then come again with stowage of worse weight
 Battle and tyrannous Tax and Wrong and Hate
 And all bad items of Deaths perilous freight

 Oer Cambridge set the yeomens mark
 Climb patriot through the April dark
 O lanthorn kindle fast thy light
 Thou budding star in the April night
 For never a star more news hath told
 Or later flame in heaven shall hold
 Ay lanthorn on the North Church tower
 When that thy church hath had her hour
 Still from the top of Reverence high
 Shalt thou illume Fames ampler sky
 For statured large oer town and tree
 Times tallest Figure stands by thee
 And dim as now thy wick may shine
 The Future lights his lamp at thine

 Now haste thee while the way is clear
 Paul Revere
 Haste Dawes but haste thou not O Sun
 To Lexington

 Then Devens looked and saw the light
 He got him forth into the night
 And watched alone on the rivershore
 And marked the British ferrying oer

 John Parker rub thine eyes and yawn
 But one oclock and yet tis Dawn
 Quick rub thine eyes and draw thy hose
 The Morning comes ere darkness goes
 Have forth and call the yeomen out
 For somewhere somewhere close about
 Full soon a Thing must come to be
 Thine honest eyes shall stare to see 
 Full soon before thy patriot eyes
 Freedom from out of a Wound shall rise

 Then haste ye Prescott and Revere
 Bring all the men of Lincoln here
 Let Chelmsford Littleton Carlisle
 Let Acton Bedford hither file 
 Oh hither file and plainly see
 Out of a wound leap Liberty

 Say Woodman April all in green
 Say Robin April hast thou seen
 In all thy travel round the earth
 Ever a morn of calmer birth
 But Mornings eye alone serene
 Can gaze across yon villagegreen
 To where the trooping British run
 Through Lexington

 Good men in fustian stand ye still
 The men in red come oer the hill
 Lay down your arms damned Rebels cry
 The men in red full haughtily
 But never a grounding gun is heard
 The men in fustian stand unstirred
 Dead calm save maybe a wise bluebird
 Puts in his little heavenly word
 O men in red if ye but knew
 The half as much as bluebirds do
 Now in this little tender calm
 Each hand would out and every palm
 With patriot palm strike brotherhoods stroke
 Or ere these lines of battle broke

 O men in red if ye but knew
 The least of the all that bluebirds do
 Now in this little godly calm
 Yon voice might sing the Futures Psalm 
 The Psalm of Love with the brotherly eyes
 Who pardons and is very wise 
 Yon voice that shouts highhoarse with ire
 Fire
 The redcoats fire the homespuns fall
 The homespuns anxious voices call
 Brother art hurt and Where hit John
 And Wipe this blood and Men come on
 And Neighbor do but lift my head
 And Who is wounded Who is dead
 Seven are killed My God my God
 Seven lie dead on the village sod
 Two Harringtons Parker Hadley Brown
 Monroe and Porter  these are down
 Nay look Stout Harrington not yet dead
 He crooks his elbow lifts his head
 He lies at the step of his own housedoor
 He crawls and makes a path of gore
 The wife from the window hath seen and rushed
 He hath reached the step but the blood hath gushed
 He hath crawled to the step of his own housedoor
 But his head hath dropped he will crawl no more
 Clasp Wife and kiss and lift the head
 Harrington lies at his doorstep dead

 But O ye Six that round him lay
 And bloodied up that April day
 As Harrington fell ye likewise fell 
 At the door of the House wherein ye dwell
 As Harrington came ye likewise came
 And died at the door of your House of Fame

 

Go by old Field of Freedoms hopes and fears
Go by old Field of Brothers hate and tears
Behold yon home of Brothers Love appears
 Set in the burnished silver of July
 On Schuylkill wrought as in old broidery
 Clasped hands upon a shining baldric lie
New Hampshire Georgia and the mighty ten
That lie between have heard the hugenibbed pen
Of Jefferson tell the rights of man to men
 They sit in the reverend Hall Shall we declare
 Floats round about the anxiousquivering air
 Twixt narrow Schuylkill and broad Delaware
Already Land thou HAST declared tis done
Ran ever clearer speech than that did run
When the sweet Seven died at Lexington
 Canst legibler write than Concords largestroked Act
 Or when at Bunker Hill the clubbed guns cracked
 Hast ink more true than blood or pen than fact
Nay as the poet mad with heavenly fires
Flings men his song whitehot then back retires
Cools heart broods oer the song again inquires
 Why did I this why that and slowly draws
 From Arts unconscious act Arts conscious laws
 So Freedom writ declares her writings cause
All question vain all chill foreboding vain
Adams ablaze with faith is hot and fain
And he straightfibred Soul of mighty grain
 Deeprooted Washington afire serene 
 Tall Bush that burns yet keeps its substance green 
 Sends daily word of import calm yet keen
Warm from the front of battle till the fire
Wraps opposition in and flames yet higher
And Doubts thin tissues flash where Hopes aspire
 And Ay declare and ever strenuous Ay
 Falls from the Twelve and Time and Nature cry
 Consent with kindred burnings of July
And delegate Dead from each past age and race
Viewless to man in large procession pace
Downward athwart each set and steadfast face
 Responding Ay in many tongues and lo
 Manhood and Faith and Self and Love and Woe
 And Art and Brotherhood and Learning go
Rearward the files of dead and softly say
Their saintly Ay and softly pass away
By airy exits of that ample day
 Now fall the chill reactionary snows
 Of mans defect and every wind that blows
 Keeps back the Spring of Freedoms perfect Rose
Now naked feet with crimson fleck the ways
And Heaven is stained with flags that mutinies raise
And Arnoldspotted move the creeping days
 Long do the eyes that look from Heaven see
 Time smoke as in the spring the mulberry tree
 With buds of battles opening fitfully
Till Yorktowns winking vapors slowly fade
And Times full top casts down a pleasant shade
Where Freedom lies unarmed and unafraid

 

 Master ever faster fly
 Now the vivid seasons by
 Now the glittering Western land
 Twins the daylit Eastern Strand
 Now white Freedoms seabird wing
 Roams the Sea of Everything
 Now the freemen to and fro
 Bind the tyrant sand and snow
 Snatching Deaths hot bolt ere hurled
 Flash new Life about the world
 Sun the secrets of the hills
 Shame the gods slowgrinding mills
 Prison Yesterday in Print
 Read Tomorrows weatherhint
 Haste before the halting Time
 Try new virtue and new crime
 Mould new faiths devise new creeds
 Run each road that frontward leads
 Driven by an Onwardache
 Scorning souls that circles make
 Now O Sin O Loves lost Shame
 Burns the land with redder flame
 North in line and South in line
 Yell the charge and spring the mine
 Heartstrong South would have his way
 Headstrong North hath said him nay
 O strong Heart strong Brain beware
 Hear a Song from out the air

 I

Lists all white and blue in the skies
 And the people hurried amain
To the Tournament under the ladies eyes
 Where jousted Heart and Brain

 II

Blow herald blow There entered Heart
 A youth in crimson and gold
Blow herald blow Brain stood apart
 Steelarmored glittering cold

 III

Hearts palfrey caracoled gayly round
 Heart traliraed merrily
But Brain sat still with never a sound 
 Full cynicalcalm was he

 IV

Hearts helmetcrest bore favors three
 From his ladys white hand caught
Brains casque was bare as Fact  not he
 Or favor gave or sought

 V

Blow herald blow Heart shot a glance
 To catch his ladys eye
But Brain looked straight afront his lance
 To aim more faithfully

 VI

They charged they struck both fell both bled
 Brain rose again ungloved
Heart fainting smiled and softly said
 My love to my Beloved

 Heart and Brain no more be twain
 Throb and think one flesh again
 Lo they weep they turn they run
 Lo they kiss Love thou art one

 

 Now the Land with drying tears
 Counts him up his flocks of years
 See he says my substance grows
 Hundredflocked my Herdsman goes
 Hundredflocked my Herdsman stands
 On the Pasts broad meadowlands
 Come from where ye mildly graze
 Black herds white herds nights and days
 Drive them homeward Herdsman Time
 From the meadows of the Prime
 I will feast my house and rest
 Neighbor East come over West
 Pledge me in good wine and words
 While I count my hundred herds
 Sum the substance of my Past
 From the first unto the last
 Chanting oer the generous brim
 Cloudy memories yet more dim
 Ghostly rhymes of Norsemen pale
 Staring by old Bjoernes sail
 Strains more noble of that night
 Worn Columbus saw his Light
 Psalms of still more heavenly tone
 How the Mayflower tossed alone
 Olden tale and later song
 Of the Patriots love and wrong
 Grandsires ballad nurses hymn 
 Chanting oer the sparkling brim
 Till I shall from first to last
 Sum the substance of my Past

 

Then called the Artists God from in the sky
This Time shall show by dream and mystery
The heart of all his matter to thine eye
Son study stars by looking down in streams
Interpret that which is by that which seems
And tell thy dreams in words which are but dreams

 I

 The Master with His lucent hand
 Pinched up the atom hills and plains
 Oer all the moiety of land
 The oceanbounded West contains
 The dust lay dead upon the calm
 And mighty middle of His palm

 II

 And lo He wrought full tenderly
 And lo He wrought with love and might
 And lo He wrought a thing to see
 Was marvel in His peoples sight
 He wrought His image dead and small
 A nothing fashioned like an All

 III

 Then breathed He softly on the dead
 Live Self  thou part yet none of Me
 Dust for humility He said
 And my warm breath for Charity
 Behold my latest work thou Earth
 The Self of Man is taking birth

 IV

 Then Land tall Adam of the West
 Thou stoodst upon the springy sod
 Thy large eye ranging selfpossest
 Thy limbs the limbs of Gods young god
 Thy Passion murmuring I will 
 Lord of the Lordship GoodandIll

 V

 O manful arms of supple size
 To clasp a world or a waist as well
 O manful eyes to front the skies
 Or look much pity down on hell
 O manful tongue to work and sing
 And soothe a child and dare a king

 VI

 O wonder Now thou sleepst in pain
 Like as some dream thy soul did grieve
 God wounds thee heals thee whole again
 And calls thee trembling to thine Eve
 Widearmed thou droppst on knightly knee
 Dear Love Dear Freedom go with me


 VII

 Then all the beasts before thee passed 
 Beast War Oppression Murder Lust
 False Art False Faith slow skulking last 
 And out of Times thickrising dust
 Thy Lord said Name them tame them Son
 Nor rest nor rest till thou hast done

 VIII

 Ah name thou false or tame thou wrong
 At heart let no man fear for thee
 Thy Past sings ever Freedoms Song
 Thy Futures voice sounds wondrous free
 And Freedom is more large than Crime
 And Error is more small than Time

 IX

 Come thou whole Self of Latter Man
 Come oer thy realm of GoodandIll
 And do thou Self that sayst I can
 And love thou Self that sayst I will
 And prove and know Times worst and best
 Thou tall young Adam of the West

At First To Charlotte Cushman



My crippled sense fares bowd along
 His uncompanioned way
And wronged by death pays life with wrong
And I wake by night and dream by day

And the Morning seems but fatigued Night
 That hath wept his visage pale
And the healthy mark twixt dark and light
In sickly sameness out doth fail

And the woods stare strange and the wind is dumb
  O Wind pray talk again 
And the Hand of the Frost spreads stark and numb
As Deaths on the deadened windowpane

Still dumb thou Wind old voluble friend
 And the middle of the day is cold
And the heart of eve beats lax i the end
As a legends climax poorly told

Oh vain the upstraining of the hands
 In the chamber late at night
Oh vain the complainings the hot demands
The prayers for a sound the tears for a sight

No word from over the starry line
 No motion felt in the dark
And never a day gives ever a sign
Or a dream sets seal with palpable mark

And O my God how slight it were
 How nothing thou All to thee
That a kiss or a whisper might fall from her
Down by the way of Time to me

Or some least grace of the body of love
  Mere wafture of floatingby
Mere sense of unseen smiling above
Mere hint sincere of a large blue eye

Mere dim receipt of sad delight
 From Nearness warm in the air
What time with the passing of the night
She also passed somehow somewhere

A Ballad of Trees and the Master



Into the woods my Master went
Clean forspent forspent
Into the woods my Master came
Forspent with love and shame
But the olives they were not blind to Him
The little gray leaves were kind to Him
The thorntree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came

Out of the woods my Master went
And He was well content
Out of the woods my Master came
Content with death and shame
When Death and Shame would woo Him last
From under the trees they drew Him last
Twas on a tree they slew Him  last
When out of the woods He came

A Florida Sunday



From cold Norse caves or buccaneer Southern seas
 Oft come repenting tempests here to die
Bewailing oldtime wrecks and robberies
 They shrive to priestly pines with many a sigh
Breathe salutary balms through lanklockd hair
 Of sick mens heads and soon  this world outworn 
Sink into saintly heavens of stirless air
 Clean from confessional One died this morn
And willed the world to wise Queen Tranquil she
 Sweet sovereign Lady of all souls that bide
In contemplation tames the too bright skies
 Like that faint agate film far down descried
Restraining suns in sudden thoughtful eyes
 Which flashed but now Blest distillation rare
Of oerrank brightness filtered waterwise
 Through all the earths in heaven  thou always fair
Still virgin bride of eercreating thought 
Dreamworker in whose dream the Futures wrought 
Healer of hurts free balm for bitter wrongs 
Most silent mother of all sounding songs 
Thou that dissolvest hells to make thy heaven 
Thou tempests heir that keepst no tempest leaven 
But after winds and thunders wide mischance
Dost brood and better thine inheritance 
Thou privacy of space where each grave Star
As in his own still chamber sits afar
To meditate yet by thy walls unpent
Shines to his fellows oer the firmament 
Oh as thou livst in all this sky and sea
That likewise lovingly do live in thee
So melt my soul in thee and thine in me
 Divine Tranquillity

Gray Pelican poised where yon broad shallows shine
Knowst thou that finny foison all is mine
In the bag below thy beak  yet thine not less
For God of His most gracious friendliness
Hath wrought that every soul this loving morn
Into all things may be newcorporate born
And each live whole in all I sail with thee
Thy Pelicans self is mine yea silver Sea
 In this large moment all thy fishes ripples bights
Pale inshore greens and distant blue delights
White visionary sails long reaches fair
By moonhornd strands that film the faroff air
 Bright sparklerevelations secret majesties
Shells wrecks and wealths are mine yea Orangetrees
That lift your small worldsystems in the light
Rich sets of round green heavens studded bright
With globes of fruit that like still planets shine
Mine is your greengold universe yea mine
White slender Lighthouse fainting to the eye
That waitst on yon keen capepoint wistfully
Like to some maiden spirit pausing pale
 Newwingd yet fain to sail
 Above the serene Gulf to where a bridegroom soul
Calls oer the soft horizon  mine thy dole
Of shut undaring wings and wan desire 
Mine too thy later hope and heavenly fire
Of kindling expectation yea all sights
 All sounds that make this morn  quick flights
Of peagreen paroquets twixt neighbor trees
Like missives and sweet morning inquiries
From green to green in green  live oaks round heads
Busy with jays for thoughts  grays whites and reds
Of pranked woodpeckers that neer gossip out
But alway tap at doors and gad about 
Robins and mockingbirds that all day long
Athwart straight sunshine weave crossthreads of song
Shuttles of music  clouds of mosses gray
That rain me rains of pleasant thoughts alway
From a low sky of leaves  faint yearning psalms
Of endless metre breathing through the palms
That crowd and lean and gaze from off the shore
Ever for one that cometh nevermore 
Palmettos ranked with childish spearpoints set
Against no enemy  rich cones that fret
High roofs of temples shafted tall with pines 
Green grateful mangroves where the sandbeach shines 
Long lissome coast that in and outward swerves
The grace of God made manifest in curves 
All riches goods and braveries never told
Of earth sun air and heaven  now I hold
Your being in my being I am ye
 And ye myself yea lastly Thee
God whom my roads all reach howeer they run
My Father Friend Beloved dear AllOne
Thee in my soul my soul in Thee I feel
Self of my self Lo through my sense doth steal
Clear cognizance of all selves and qualities
Of all existence that hath been or is
Of all strange haps that men miscall of chance
And all the works of tireless circumstance
Each borders each like mutual sea and shore
Nor aught misfits his neighbor thats before
Nor him thats after  nay through this still air
Out of the North come quarrels and keen blare
Of challenge by the hotbreathd parties blown
Yet break they not this peace with alien tone
Fray not my heart nor fright me for my land
 I hear from allwards allwise understand
The great bird Purpose bears me twixt her wings
And I am one with all the kinsmen things
That eer my Father fathered Oh to me
All questions solve in this tranquillity
Een this dark matter once so dim so drear
Now shines upon my spirit heavenlyclear
Thou Father without logic tellest me
How this divine denial true may be
 How Alls in each yet every one of all
Maintains his Self complete and several

To My Class On Certain Fruits and Flowers Sent Me in Sickness



If spicyfringed pinks that blush and pale
 With passions of perfume  if violets blue
 That hint of heaven with odor more than hue 
If perfect roses each a holy Grail
Wherefrom the blood of beauty doth exhale
 Grave raptures round  if leaves of green as new
 As those fresh chaplets wove in dawn and dew
By Emily when down the Athenian vale
She paced to do observance to the May
 Nor dreamed of Arcite nor of Palamon 
If fruits that riped in some more riotous play
 Of wind and beam that stirs our temperate sun 
 If these the products be of love and pain
 Oft may I suffer and you love again

On Violets Wafers Sent Me When I Was Ill



Finetissued as her fingertips and white
 As all her thoughts in shape like shields of prize
 As if before young Violets dreaming eyes
Still blazed the two great Theban bucklers bright
That swayed the random of that furious fight
 Where Palamon and Arcite made assize
 For Emily fresh crisp as her replies
That not with sting but pith do oft invite
 More trial of the tongue simple like her
Well fitting lowlihood yet fine as well
  The queens no finer rich though gossamer
In help to him they came to which may tell
 How rich that him SHELL come to thus men see
 Like Violets self een Violets wafers be

Ireland

Written for the Art Autograph during the Irish Famine 1880



Heartsome Ireland winsome Ireland
 Charmer of the sun and sea
Bright beguiler of old anguish
 How could Famine frown on thee

As our GulfStream drawn to theeward
 Turns him from his northward flow
And our wintry western headlands
 Send thee summer from their snow

Thus the main and cordial current
 Of our love sets over sea 
Tender comely valiant Ireland
Songful soulful sorrowful Ireland 
 Streaming warm to comfort thee

Under the Cedarcroft Chestnut



Trim set in ancient sward his manful bole
 Upbore his frontage largely toward the sky
We could not dream but that he had a soul
 What virtue breathed from out his bravery

We gazed oerhead far down our deepening eyes
 Rained glamours from his green midsummer mass
The worth and sum of all his centuries
 Suffused his mighty shadow on the grass

A Presence large a grave and steadfast Form
 Amid the leaves light play and fantasy
A calmness conquered out of many a storm
 A Manhood mastered by a chestnuttree

Then while his monarch fingers downward held
 The rugged burrs wherewith his state was rife
A voice of large authoritative Eld
 Seemed uttering quickly parables of life

How Life in truth was sharply set with ills
 A kernel cased in quarrels yea a sphere
Of stings and hedgehoground of mortal quills
 How most men itched to eat too soon i the year

And took but wounds and worries for their pains
 Whereas the wise withheld their patient hands
Nor plucked green pleasures till the sun and rains
 And seasonable ripenings burst all bands

And opened wide the liberal burrs of life
 There O my Friend beneath the chestnut bough
Gazing on thee immerged in modern strife
 I framed a prayer of fervency  that thou

In soul and stature larger than thy kind
 Still more to this strong Form mightst liken thee
Till thy whole Self in every fibre find
 The tranquil lordship of thy chestnut tree

An Evening Song



Look off dear Love across the sallow sands
 And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands
 Ah longer longer we

Now in the seas red vintage melts the sun
 As Egypts pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra night drinks all Tis done
 Love lay thine hand in mine

Come forth sweet stars and comfort heavens heart
 Glimmer ye waves round else unlighted sands
O night divorce our sun and sky apart
 Never our lips our hands

  A Sunrise Song leads a group of seven short poems 
  overlooked in earlier editions Six of these beginning with 
  On a Palmetto were unrevised pencillings of late date 
  excepting the lines of 1866 to J D H 
 




A Sunrise Song



Young palmer sun that to these shining sands
 Pourest thy pilgrims tale discoursing still
Thy silver passages of sacred lands
 With news of Sepulchre and Dolorous Hill

Canst thou be he that yestersunset warm
 Purple with Paynim rage and wrack desire
Dashed ravening out of a dusty lair of Storm
 Harried the west and set the world on fire

Hast thou perchance repented Saracen Sun
 Wilt warm the world with peace and dovedesire
Or wilt thou ere this very day be done
 Blaze Saladin still with unforgiving fire

On a Palmetto



Through all that yearscarred agony of height
Unblest of bough or bloom to where expands
His wandy circlet with his bladed bands
Dividing every wind or loud or light
To termless hymns of love and old despite
Yon tall palmetto in the twilight stands
Bare Dante of these purgatorial sands
That glimmer marginal to the monstrous night
Comes him a Southwind from the scented vine
It breathes of Beatrice through all his blades
North East or West Guelphwind or Ghibelline
Tis shredded into music down the shades
All seabreaths landbreaths systol diastol
Sway minstrels of that griefmelodious Soul

Struggle



My soul is like the oar that momently
 Dies in a desperate stress beneath the wave
Then glitters out again and sweeps the sea
 Each second Im newborn from some new grave




Control



O Hunger Hunger I will harness thee
And make thee harrow all my spirits glebe
Of old the blind bard Herve sang so sweet
He made a wolf to plow his land




To J D H

Killed at Surrey C H October 1866



     

Dear friend forgive a wild lament
 Insanely following thy flight
I would not cumber thine ascent
 Nor drag thee back into the night

But the great seawinds sigh with me
 The fairfaced stars seem wrinkled old
And I would that I might lie with thee
 There in the grave so cold so cold

Grave walls are thick I cannot see thee
 And the round skies are far and steep
Awild to quaff some cup of Lethe
 Pain is proud and scorns to weep

My heart breaks if it cling about thee
 And still breaks if far from thine
O drear drear death to live without thee
 O sad life  to keep thee mine

     




Marsh Hymns

Between Dawn and Sunrise



Were silver pink and had a soul
 Which soul were shy which shyness might
A visible influence be and roll
 Through heaven and earth  twere thou O light

O rhapsody of the wraith of red
 O blush but yet in prophecy
O sunhint that hath overspread
 Sky marsh my soul and yonder sail




Thou and I



So one in heart and thought I trow
That thou mightst press the strings and I might draw the bow
And both would meet in music sweet
Thou and I I trow

The Hard Times in Elfland

A Story of Christmas Eve



Strange that the termagant winds should scold
 The Christmas Eve so bitterly
But Wife and Harry the fouryearold
 Big Charley Nimblewits and I

Blithe as the wind was bitter drew
 More frontward of the mighty fire
Where wise Newfoundland Fan foreknew
 The heaven that Christian dogs desire 

Stretched oer the rug serene and grave
 Huge nose on heavy paws reclined
With never a drowning boy to save
 And warmth of body and peace of mind

And as our happy circle sat
 The fire well cappd the company
In grave debate or careless chat
 A right good fellow mingled he

He seemed as one of us to sit
 And talked of things above below
With flames more winsome than our wit
 And coals that burned like love aglow

While thus our rippling discourse rolled
 Smooth down the channel of the night
We spoke of Time thereat one told
 A parable of the Seasons flight

Time was a Shepherd with four sheep
 In a certain Field he long abode
He stood by the bars and his flock bade leap
 One at a time to the Common Road

And first there leapt like bird on wing
 A lissome Lamb that played in the air
I heard the Shepherd call him Spring
 Oh largeeyed fresh and snowy fair

He skipped the flowering Highway fast
 Hurried the hedgerows green and white
Set maids and men ayearning passed
 The Bend and gambolld out of sight

And next marched forth a matron Ewe
 While Time took down a bar for her
Udderd so large twas much ado
 Een then to clear the barrier

Full softly shone her silken fleece
 What stately time she paced along
Each heartsome hoofstroke wrought increase
 Of sunlight substance seedling song

In flower in fruit in field in bird
 Till the great globe rich fleckd and pied
Like some large peach half pinkly furred
 Turned to the sun a glowing side

And hung in the heavenly orchard bright
 Nonesuch complete
 Then while the Ewe
Slow passed the Bend a blur of light
 The Shepherds face in sadness grew

Summer he said as one would say
 A sigh in syllables So in haste
For shame of Summers long delay
 Yet gazing still what way she paced

He summoned Autumn slanting down
 The second bar Thereover strode
A Wether fleeced in burning brown
 And largely loitered down the Road

Far as the farmers sight his shape
 Majestic moving oer the way
All cry To harvest crush the grape
 And haul the corn and house the hay

Till presently no man can say
 So brown the woods that line that end
If yet the brownfleeced Wether may
 Or not have passed beyond the Bend

Now turn I towards the Shepherd lo
 An aged Ram flappd gnarlyhornd
With bones that crackle oer the snow
 Rheumd windgalld ragfleecd burrd and thornd

Time takes the third bar off for him
 He totters down the windy lane
Tis Winter still the Bend lies dim
 O Lamb would thou wouldst leap again

Those seasons out we talked of these
 And I with inward purpose sly
To shield my purse from Christmas trees
 And stockings and wild robbery

When Hal and Nimblewits invade
 My cash in Santa Clauss name
In full the hard hard times surveyed
 Denounced all waste as crime and shame

Hinted that waste might be a term
 Including skates velocipedes
Kites marbles soldiers towers infirm
 Bows arrows cannon Indian reeds

Cappistols drums mechanic toys
 And all th infernal host of horns
Whereby to strenuous hells of noise
 Are turned the blessed Christmas morns

Thus roused  those horns  to sacred rage
 I rose forefinger high in air
When Harry cried SOME war to wage
 Papa is hard times evywhere

Maybe in Santa Clauss land
 It isnt hard times none at all
Now blessed Vision to my hand
 Most pat a marvel strange did fall

Scarce had my Harry ceased when Look
 He cried leapt up in wild alarm
Ran to my Comrade shelter took
 Beneath the startled mothers arm

And so was still what time we saw
 A foot hang down the fireplace Then
With painful scrambling scratched and raw
 Two hands that seemed like hands of men

Eased down two legs and a body through
 The blazing fire and forth there came
Before our wide and wondering view
 A figure shrinking half with shame

And half with weakness Sir I said
  But with a mien of dignity
The seedy stranger raised his head
 My friends Im Santa Claus said he

But oh how changed That rotund face
 The new moon rivalld pale and thin
Where once was cheek now empty space
 Whateer stood out did now stand in

His piteous legs scarce propped him up
 His arms mere sickles seemed to be
But most oerflowed our sorrows cup
 When that we saw  or did not see 

His belly we remembered how
 It shook like a bowl of jelly fine
An earthquake could not shake it now
 He HAD no belly  not a sign

Yes yes old friends you well may stare
 I HAVE seen better days he said
But now with shrinkage loss and care
 Your Santa Claus scarce owns his head

Weve had such hard hard times this year
 For goblins Never knew the like
All Elflands mortgaged And we fear
 The gnomes are just about to strike

I once was rich and round and hale
 The whole world called me jolly brick
But listen to a piteous tale
 Young Harry  Santa Claus is sick

Twas thus a smoothtongued railroad man
 Comes to my house and talks to me
Ive got says he a little plan
 That suits this nineteenth century

Instead of driving as you do
 Six reindeer slow from house to house
Lets build a Grand Trunk Railway through
 From here to earths last terminus

Well touch at every chimneytop
 An Elevated Track of course
Then as we whisk you by youll drop
 Each package down just think the force

Youll save the time  Besides well make
 Our millions look you soon we will
Compete for freights  and then well take
 Dame Fortunes bales of good and ill

Why shes the biggest shipper sir
 That eer did business in this world
Then Death that ceaseless Traveller
 Shall on his rounds by us be whirled

When ghosts return to walk with men
 Well bring em cheap by steam and fast
Well run a Branch to heaven and then
 Well riot man for then at last

Well make with heaven a contract fair
 To call each hour from town to town
And carry the dead folks souls up there
 And bring the unborn babies down

The plan seemed fair I gave him cash
 Nay every penny I could raise
My wife eer cried Tis rash tis rash
 How could I know the stockthiefs ways

But soon I learned full well poor fool
 My woes began that wretched day
The President plied me like a tool
 In lawyers fees and rights of way

Injunctions leases charters I
 Was meshed as in a mighty maze
The stock ran low the talk ran high
 Then quickly flamed the final blaze

With never an inch of track  tis true
 The debts were large    the ofttold tale
The President rolled in splendor new
  He bought my silver at the sale

Yes sold me out weve moved away
 Ive had to give up everything
My reindeer even whom I    pray
 Excuse me    here oersorrowing

Poor Santa Claus burst into tears
 Then calmed again my reindeer fleet
I gave them up on foot my dears
 I now must plod through snow and sleet

Retrenchment rules in Elfland now
 Yes every luxury is cut off
 Which by the way reminds me how
 I caught this dreadful hacking cough

I cut off the tail of my Ulster furred
 To make young Kris a coat of state
That very night the storm occurred
 Thus we became the sport of Fate

For I was out till after one
 Surveying chimneytops and roofs
And planning how it could be done
 Without my reindeers bouncing hoofs

My dear says Mrs Claus that night
 A most superior woman she
It never never can be right
 That you deepsunk in poverty

This year should leave your poor old bed
 And trot about bent down with toys
Theres Kris acrying now for bread
 To give to other peoples boys

Since youve been out the news arrives
 The Elfs Insurance Companys gone
Ah Claus those premiums Now our lives
 Depend on yours thus griefs go on

And even while youre thus harassed
 I do believe if out you went
Youd go in spite of all thats passed
 To the children of that President

Oh Charley Harry Nimblewits
 These eyes that night neer slept a wink
My path seemed honeycombed with pits
 Naught could I do but think and think

But with the day my courage rose
 Neer shall my boys MY boys I cried
When Christmas morns their eyes unclose
 Find empty stockings gaping wide

Then hewed and whacked and whittled I
 The wife the girls and Kris took fire
They spun sewed cut  till by and by
 We made at home my pack entire

He handed me a bundle here
 Now hoist me up there gently quick
Dear boys DONT look for much this year
 Remember Santa Claus is sick

 Dialect Poems






A Florida Ghost



 Down mildest shores of milkwhite sand
 By cape and fair Floridian bay
Twixt billowy pines  a surf asleep on land 
 And the great Gulf at play

 Past faroff palms that filmed to nought
 Or in and out the cunning keys
That laced the land like fragile patterns wrought
 To edge old broideries

 The sail sighed on all day for joy
 The prow each pouting wave did leave
All smile and song with sheen and ripple coy
 Till the dusk diver Eve

 Brought up from out the brimming East
 The oval moon a perfect pearl
In that large lustre all our haste surceased
 The sail seemed fain to furl

 The silent steersman landward turned
 And ship and shore set breast to breast
Under a palm wherethrough a planet burned
 We ate and sank to rest

 But soon from sleeps dear death it seemed
 I rose and strolled along the sea
Down silver distances that faintly gleamed
 On to infinity

 Till suddenly I paused for lo
 A shape from whence I neer divined
Appeared before me pacing to and fro
 With head far down inclined

 A wraith I thought that walks the shore
 To solve some old perplexity
Full heavy hung the draggled gown he wore
 His hair flew all awry

 He waited not as ghosts oft use
 To be dearheavend and ohd
But briskly said Goodevenin whats the news
 Consumption After boad

 Or mebbe youre intendin of
 Investments Orangeplantin Pine
Hotel or Sanitarium What above
 This yeath CAN be your line

 Speakin of sanitariums now
 Jest look ee here my friend
I know a little story  well I swow
 Wait till you hear the end

 Some year or more ago I spose
 I roamed from Maine to Floridy
And  see where them Palmettos grows
 I bought that little key

 Callatin for to build right off
 A clossal sanitarium
Big surf Gulf breeze Jest death upon a cough
  I run it high to hum

 Well sir I went to work in style
 Bought me a steamboat loaded it
With my hotel pyazers moren a mile
 Already framed and fit

 Insured em fetched em safe around
 Put up my buildin moored my boat
COMplete then went to bed and slept as sound
 As if Id paid a note

 Now on that very night a squall
 Cum up from someeres  some bad place
An blowed an tore an reared an pitched an all
  I had to run a race

 Right out o bed from that hotel
 An git to yonder risin ground
For twixt the sea that riz and rain that fell
 I pooty nigh was drowned

 An thar I stood till mornin cum
 Right on yon little knoll of sand
FreQUENTly wishin I had stayed to hum
 Fur from this tarnal land

 When mornin cum I took a good
 Long look and  well sir sures Im ME 
That boat laid right whar that hotel had stood
 And HIT sailed out to sea

 No Ill not keep you goodbye friend
 Dont think about it much  preehaps
Your brain might git seesawin end for end
 Like them asylum chaps

 For here I walk forevermore
 Atryin to make it gee
How one same wind could blow my ship to shore
 And my hotel to sea

Uncle Jims Baptist Revival Hymn

By Sidney and Clifford Lanier

Not long ago a certain Georgia cottonplanter driven to desperation
by awaking each morning to find that the grass had
quite outgrown the cotton overnight and was likely to choke it
in defiance of his lazy freedmens hoes and ploughs
set the whole State in a laugh by exclaiming to a group of fellowsufferers
Its all stuff about Cincinnatus leaving the plough to go into politics
FOR PATRIOTISM he was just arunnin from grass

This state of things  when the delicate young rootlets of the cotton
are struggling against the hardier multitudes of the grasssuckers 
is universally described in plantation parlance by the phrase in the grass
and Uncle Jim appears to have found in it so much similarity
to the condition of his own Baptis church overrun as it was
by the cares of this world that he has embodied it in the refrain
of a revival hymn such as the colored improvisator of the South
not infrequently constructs from his daily surroundings
He has drawn all the ideas of his stanzas from the early morning phenomena of
those critical weeks when the loud plantationhorn is blown before daylight
in order to rouse all hands for a long days fight against the common enemy
of cottonplanting mankind

In addition to these exegetical commentaries the Northern reader
probably needs to be informed that the phrase peerten up means substantially
to spur up and is an active form of the adjective peert
probably a corruption of pert which is so common in the South
and which has much the signification of smart in New England as eg
a peert horse in antithesis to a sorry  ie poor mean lazy one



Solo  Sins roosters crowed Ole Mahsters riz
 De sleepintime is pas
 Wake up dem lazy Baptissis
Chorus  Deys mightily in de grass grass
 Deys mightily in de grass

Ole Mahsters blowed de mornin horn
 Hes blowed a powerful blas
O Baptis come come hoe de corn
 Yous mightily in de grass grass
 Yous mightily in de grass

De Methdis teams done hitched O fool
 De days abreakin fas
Gear up dat lean ole Baptis mule
 Deys mightily in de grass grass
 Deys mightily in de grass

De workmens few an monsrous slow
 De cottons sheddin fas
Whoop look jes look at de Baptis row
 Hits mightily in de grass grass
 Hits mightily in de grass

De jaybird squeal to de mockinbird Stop
 Don gimme none o yo sass
Better sing one song for de Baptis crop
 Deys mightily in de grass grass
 Deys mightily in de grass

And de ole crow croak Don work no no
 But de fiellark say Yaas yaas
An I spec you mighty glad you debblish crow

Nine from Eight



I was drivin my twomule waggin
With a lot o truck for sale
Towards Macon to git some baggin
Which my cotton was ready to bale
And I come to a place on the side o the pike
Whar a peert little winter branch jest had throwd
The sand in a kind of a sandbar like
And I seed a leetle ways up the road
A man squattin down like a big bulltoad
On the ground afiggerin thar in the sand
With his finger and motionin with his hand
 And he looked like Ellick Garry
And as I driv up I heerd him bleat
To hisself like a lamb Hauh nine from eight
 Leaves nuthin  and none to carry

And Ellicks bullcart was standin
A crosswise of the way
And the little bull was aexpandin
Hisself on a wisp of hay
But Ellick he sat with his head bent down
Astudyin and musin powerfully
And his forrud was creased with a turrible frown
And he was awurken appearently
A rethmetic sum that wouldnt gee
Fur he kep on figgerin away in the sand
With his finger and motionin with his hand
 And I seed it WAS Ellick Garry
And agin I heard him softly bleat
To hisself like a lamb Hauh nine from eight
 Leaves nuthin  and none to carry

I woad my mules mighty easy
Ellicks back was towards the road
And the wind hit was sorter breezy
And I got down offn my load
And I crep up close to Ellicks back
And I heerd him atalkin softly thus
Them figgers is got me under the hack
I caint see how to git outn the muss
Except to jest natally fail and bus
My crapleen calls for nine hundred and more
My counts o sales is eight hundred and four
 Of cotton for Ellick Garry
Thars eight ought four jest like on a slate
Heres nine and two oughts  Hauh nine from eight
 Leaves nuthin  and none to carry

Them crapleens oh them crapleens
I giv one to Pardman and Sharks
Hit gobbled me up like snapbeans
In a patch full o old fiellarks
But I thought I could fool the crapleen nice
And I hauled my cotton to Jammel and Cones
But shuh fore I even had settled my price
They tuck affidavy without no bones
And levelled upon me fur all ther loans
To the mount of sum nine hundred dollars or more
And sold me out clean for eight hundred and four
 As sure as Im Ellick Garry
And thar it is down all squar and straight
But I cant make it gee fur nine from eight
 Leaves nuthin  and none to carry

Then I says Hello here Garry
However you star and frown
Thares somethin fur YOU to carry
Fur youve worked it upside down
Then he riz and walked to his little bullcart
And made like he neither had seen nor heerd
Nor knowed that I knowed of his raskilly part
And he tried to look as if HE want feared
And gathered his lines like he never keered
And he driv down the road bout a quarter or so
And then looked around and I hollered Hello
 Look here Mister Ellick Garry
You may git up soon and lie down late
But youll always find that nine from eight
 Leaves nuthin  and none to carry

Thars more in the Man than thar is in the Land



I knowed a man which he lived in Jones
Which Jones is a county of red hills and stones
And he lived pretty much by gittin of loans
And his mules was nuthin but skin and bones
And his hogs was flat as his cornbread pones
And he had bout a thousand acres o land

This man  which his name it was also Jones 
He swore that hed leave them old red hills and stones
Fur he couldnt make nuthin but yallerish cotton
And little o THAT and his fences was rotten
And what little corn he had HIT was boughten
And dinged ef a livin was in the land

And the longer he swore the madder he got
And he riz and he walked to the stable lot
And he hollered to Tom to come thar and hitch
Fur to emigrate somewhar whar land was rich
And to quit raisin cockburrs thistles and sich
And a wastin ther time on the cussed land

So him and Tom they hitched up the mules
Pertestin that folks was mighty big fools
That ud stay in Georgy ther lifetime out
Jest scratchin a livin when all of em mought
Git places in Texas whar cotton would sprout
By the time you could plant it in the land

And he driv by a house whar a man named Brown
Was a livin not fur from the edge o town
And he bantered Brown fur to buy his place
And said that bein as money was skace
And bein as sheriffs was hard to face
Two dollars an acre would git the land

They closed at a dollar and fifty cents
And Jones he bought him a waggin and tents
And loaded his corn and his wimmin and truck
And moved to Texas which it tuck
His entire pile with the best of luck
To git thar and git him a little land

But Brown moved out on the old Jones farm
And he rolled up his breeches and bared his arm
And he picked all the rocks from offn the groun
And he rooted it up and he plowed it down
Then he sowed his corn and his wheat in the land

Five years glid by and Brown one day
Which hed got so fat that he wouldnt weigh
Was a settin down sorter lazily
To the bulliest dinner you ever see
When one o the children jumped on his knee
And says Yans Jones which you bought his land

And thar was Jones standin out at the fence
And he hadnt no waggin nor mules nor tents
Fur he had left Texas afoot and cum
To Georgy to see if he couldnt git sum
Employment and he was a lookin as hum
Ble as ef he had never owned any land

But Brown he axed him in and he sot
Him down to his vittles smokin hot
And when he had filled hisself and the floor
Brown looked at him sharp and riz and swore
That whether mens land was rich or poor
Thar was more in the MAN than thar was in the LAND

Joness Private Argyment



That air same Jones which lived in Jones
 He had this pint about him
Hed swear with a hundred sighs and groans
That farmers MUST stop gittin loans
 And git along without em

That bankers warehousemen and sich
 Was fattnin on the planter
And Tennessy was rottenrich
Araisin meat and corn all which
 Drawd money to Atlanta

And the only thing says Jones to do
 Is eat no meat thats boughten
But tear up every I O U
And plant all corn and swear for true
 To quit araisin cotton

Thus spouted Jones whar folks could hear
  At Court and other gatherins
And thus kep spoutin many a year
Proclaimin loudly far and near
 Sich fiddlesticks and blatherins

But one allfired sweatin day
 It happened I was hoein
My lower cornfield which it lay
Longside the road that runs my way
 Whar I can see whats goin

And ater twelve oclock had come
 I felt a kinder faggin
And laid myself unneath a plum
To let my dinner settle sum
 When long come Joness waggin

And Jones was settin in it SO
 Areadin of a paper
His mules was goin powerful slow
Fur he had tied the lines onto
 The staple of the scraper

The mules they stopped about a rod
 From me and went to feedin
Longside the road upon the sod
But Jones which he had tuck a tod
 Not knowin kept areadin

And presently says he Hits true
 That Clisbys head is level
Thars one thing farmers all must do
To keep themselves from goin tew
 Bankruptcy and the devil

More corn more corn MUST plant less ground
 And MUSTNT eat whats boughten
Next year theyll do it reasonins sound
And cotton will fetch bout a dollar a pound
 THARFORE ILL plant ALL cotton

The Jacquerie A Fragment



 Chapter I

Once on a time a Dawn all red and bright
Leapt on the conquered ramparts of the Night
And flamed one brilliant instant on the world
Then back into the historic moat was hurled
And Night was King again for many years
 Once on a time the Rose of Spring blushed out
But Winter angrily withdrew it back
Into his rough newbursten husk and shut
The stern huskleaves and hid it many years
 Once Famine tricked himself with ears of corn
And Hate strung flowers on his spiked belt
And glum Revenge in silver lilies pranked him
And Lust put violets on his shameless front
And all minced forth o the street like holiday folk
That sally off afield on Summer morns
 Once certain hounds that knew of many a chase
And bare great wounds of antler and of tusk
That they had taen to give a lord some sport
 Good hounds that would have died to give lords sport 
Were so bewrayed and kicked by these same lords
That all the pack turned tooth o the knights and bit
As knights had been no better things than boars
And took revenge as bloody as a mans
Unhoundlike sudden hot i the chops and sweet
 Once sat a falcon on a ladys wrist
Seeming to doze with wrinkled eyelid drawn
But dreaming hard of hoods and slaveries
And of dim hungers in his heart and wings
Then while the mistress gazed above for game
Sudden he flew into her painted face
And hooked his hornclaws in her lily throat
And drove his beak into her lips and eyes
In fierce and hawkish kissing that did scar
And mar the ladys beauty evermore
 And once while Chivalry stood tall and lithe
And flashed his sword above the stricken eyes
Of all the simple peasantfolk of France
While Thought was keen and hot and quick
And did not play as in these later days
Like summerlightning flickering in the west
 As little dreadful as if glowworms lay
In the cool and watery clouds and glimmered weak 
But gleamed and struck at once or oak or man
And left not space for Time to wave his wing
Betwixt the instantaneous flash and stroke
While yet the needs of life were brave and fierce
And did not hide their deeds behind their words
And logic came not twixt desire and act
And WantandTake was the whole Form of life
While Love had fires aburning in his veins
And hidden Hate could flash into revenge
Ere yet young Trade was ware of his big thews
Or dreamed that in the bolder afterdays
He would hew down and bind old Chivalry
And drag him to the highest height of fame
And plunge him thence in the sea of still Romance
To lie for aye in neverrusted mail
Gleaming through quiet ripples of soft songs
And sheens of old traditionary tales 
On such a time a certain May arose
From out that blue Sea that between five lands
Lies like a violet midst of five large leaves
Arose from out this violet and flew on
And stirred the spirits of the woods of France
And smoothed the brows of moody Auvergne hills
And wrought warm seatints into maidens eyes
And calmed the wordy air of markettowns
With faint suggestions blown from distant buds
Until the land seemed a mere dream of land
And in this dreamfield Life sat like a dove
And cooed across unto her dovemate Death
Brooding pathetic by a river lone
Oh sharper tangs pierced through this perfumed May
Strange aches sailed by with odors on the wind
As when we kneel in flowers that grow on graves
Of friends who died unworthy of our love
King John of France was proving such an ache
In English prisons wide and fair and grand
Whose long expanses of green park and chace
Did ape large liberty with such success
As smiles of irony ape smiles of love
Down from the oaks of Hertford Castle park
Double with warm rosebreaths of southern Spring
Came rumors as if odors too had thorns
Sharp rumors how the three Estates of France
Like old Threeheaded Cerberus of Hell
Had set upon the Duke of Normandy
Their rightful Regent snarled in his great face
Snapped jagged teeth in inchbreadth of his throat
And blown such hot and savage breath upon him
That he had tossed great sops of royalty
Unto the clamorous threemawed baying beast
And was not further on his way withal
And had but changed a snarl into a growl
How Arnold de Cervolles had taen the track
That war had burned along the unhappy land
Shouting since France is then too poor to pay
The soldiers that have bloody devoir done
And since needs must pardie a man must eat
Arm gentlemen swords slice as well as knives
And so had tempted stout men from the ranks
And now was adding robbers waste to wars
Stealing the leavings of remorseless battle
And making gaunter the gaunt bones of want
How this Cervolles called Archpriest by the mass
Through warm Provence had marched and menace made
Against Pope Innocent at Avignon
And how the Pope nor ate nor drank nor slept
Through godly fear concerning his red wines
For if these knaves should sack his holy house
And all the blessed casks be knocked o the head
HORRENDUM all his Holiness drink to be
Profanely guzzled down the reeking throats
Of scoundrels and inflame them on to seize
The massy coffers of the Churchs gold
And steal mayhap the carven silver shrine
And all the golden crucifixes No 
And so the holy father Pope made stir
And had sent forth a legate to Cervolles
And treated with him and made compromise
And last had bidden all the Archpriests troop
To come and banquet with him in his house
Where they did wassail high by night and day
And Father Pope sat at the board and carved
 Midst jokes that flowed full greasily
And priest and soldier trolled good songs for mass
And all the prayers the Priests made were pray drink
And all the oaths the Soldiers swore were drink
Till Mirth sat like a jaunty postillon
Upon the back of Time and urged him on
With piquant spur past chapel and past cross
How Charles King of Navarre in long duress
By mandate of King John within the walls
Of Crevacoeur and then of strong Alleres
In faithful ward of Sir Tristan du Bois
Was now escaped had supped with Guy Kyrec
Had now a pardon of the Regent Duke
By half compulsion of a Paris mob
Had turned the peoples love upon himself
By smooth harangues and now was bold to claim
That France was not the Kingdom of King John
But By our Lady his by right and worth
And so was plotting treason in the State
And laughing at weak Charles of Normandy
Nay these had been like good news to the King
Were any man but bold enough to tell
The King what bitter sayings men had made
And hawked augmenting up and down the land
Against the barons and great lords of France
That fled from English arrows at Poictiers
POICTIERS POICTIERS this grain i the eye of France
Had swelled it to a big and bloodshot ball
That looked with rage upon a world askew
Poictiers disgrace was now but two years old
Yet so outrageous rank and full was grown
That France was wholly overspread with shade
And bitter fruits lay on the untilled ground
That stank and bred so foul contagious smells
That not a nose in France but stood awry
Nor boor that cried not FAUGH upon the air


 Chapter II

Franciscan friar John de Rochetaillade
With gentle gesture lifted up his hand
And poised it high above the steady eyes
Of a great crowd that thronged the marketplace
In fair Clermont to hear him prophesy
Midst of the crowd old Gris Grillon the maimed
 A wretched wreck that fate had floated out
From the drear storm of battle at Poictiers
A living man whose larger moiety
Was dead and buried on the battlefield 
A grisly trunk without or arms or legs
And scarred with hoofcuts over cheek and brow
Lay in his wickercradle smiling
 Jacques
Quoth he My son I would behold this priest
That is not fat and loves not wine and fasts
And stills the folk with waving of his hand
And threats the knights and thunders at the Pope
Make way for Gris ye who are whole of limb
Set me on yonder ledge that I may see
Forthwith a dozen horny hands reached out
And lifted Gris Grillon upon the ledge
Whereon he lay and overlooked the crowd
And from the graygrown hedges of his brows
Shot forth a glance against the friars eye
That struck him like an arrow
 Then the friar
With voice as low as if a maiden hummed
Lovesongs of Provence in a mild daydream
And when he broke the second seal I heard
The second beast say Come and see
 And then
Went out another horse and he was red
And unto him that sat thereon was given
To take the peace of earth away and set
Men killing one another and they gave
To him a mighty sword
 The friar paused
And pointed round the circle of sad eyes
There is no face of man or woman here
But showeth print of the hard hoof of war
Ah yonder leaneth limbless Gris Grillon
Friends Gris Grillon is France
 Good France my France
Wilt never walk on glorys hills again
Wilt never work among thy vines again
Art footless and art handless evermore
 Thou felon War I do arraign thee now
Of mayhem of the four main limbs of France
Thou old red criminal stand forth I charge
 But O I am too utter sorrowful
To urge large accusation now
 Nathless
My work today is still more grievous Hear
The stains that war hath wrought upon the land
Show but as faint white flecks if seen o the side
Of those bloodcovered images that stalk
Through yon cold chambers of the future as
The prophetmood now stealing on my soul
Reveals them marching marching marching See
There go the kings of France in piteous file
The deadly diamonds shining in their crowns
Do wound the foreheads of their Majesties
And glitter through a setting of bloodgouts
As if they smiled to think how men are slain
By the sharp facets of the gem of power
And how the kings of men are slaves of stones
But look The long procession of the kings
Wavers and stops the world is full of noise
The ragged peoples storm the palaces
They rave they laugh they thirst they lap the stream
That trickles from the regal vestments down
And lapping smack their heated chaps for more
And ply their daggers for it till the kings
All die and lie in a crooked sprawl of death
Ungainly foul and stiff as any heap
Of villeins rotting on a battlefield
 Tis true that when these things have come to pass
Then never a king shall rule again in France
For every villein shall be king in France
And who hath lordship in him whether born
In hedge or silken bed shall be a lord
And queens shall be as thick i the land as wives
And all the maids shall maids of honor be
And high and low shall commune solemnly
And stars and stones shall have free interview
But woe is me tis also piteous true
That ere this gracious time shall visit France
Your graves Beloved shall be some centuries old
And so your childrens and their childrens graves
And many generations
 Ye O ye
Shall grieve and ye shall grieve and ye shall grieve
Your Life shall bend and oer his shuttle toil
A weaver weaving at the loom of grief
Your Life shall sweat twixt anvil and hot forge
An armorer working at the sword of grief
Your Life shall moil i the ground and plant his seed
A farmer foisoning a huge crop of grief
Your Life shall chaffer in the marketplace
A merchant trading in the goods of grief
Your Life shall go to battle with his bow
A soldier fighting in defence of grief
By every rudder that divides the seas
Tall Grief shall stand the helmsman of the ship
By every wain that jolts along the roads
Stout Grief shall walk the driver of the team
Midst every herd of cattle on the hills
Dull Grief shall lie the herdsman of the drove
Oh Grief shall grind your bread and play your lutes
And marry you and bury you
  How else
Whos here in France can win her peoples faith
And stand in front and lead the people on
Where is the Church
 The Church is far too fat
Not mark by robust swelling of the thews
But puffed and flabby large with gross increase
Of winefat plaguefat dropsyfat
 O shame
Thou Pope that cheatest God at Avignon
Thou that shouldst be the Father of the world
And Regent of it whilst our God is gone
Thou that shouldst blaze with conferred majesty
And smite old LustotheFlesh so as by flame
Thou that canst turn thy key and lock Grief up
Or turn thy key and unlock Heavens Gate
Thou that shouldst be the veritable hand
That Christ downstretcheth out of heaven yet
To draw up him that fainteth to His heart
Thou that shouldst bear thy fruit yet virgin live
As she that bore a man yet sinned not
Thou that shouldst challenge the most special eyes
Of Heaven and Earth and Hell to mark thee since
Thou shouldst be Heavens best captain Earths best friend
And Hells best enemy  false Pope false Pope
The world thy child is sick and like to die
But thou art dinnerdrowsy and cannot come
And Life is sore beset and crieth help
But thou brookst not disturbance at thy wine
And France is wild for one to lead her souls
But thou art huge and fat and laggest back
Among the remnants of forsaken camps
Thourt not Gods Pope thou art the Devils Pope
Thou art first Squire to that most puissant knight
Lord Satan who thy faithful squireship long
Hath watched and well shall guerdon
 Ye sad souls
So faint with work ye love not so thinworn
With miseries ye wrought not so outraged
By strokes of ill that pass th illdoers heads
And cleave the innocent so desperate tired
Of insult that doth day by day abuse
The humblest dignity of humblest men
Ye cannot call toward the Church for help
The Church already is oerworked with care
Of its dyspeptic stomach
 Ha the Church
Forgets about eternity
 I had
A vision of forgetfulness
 O Dream
Born of a dream as yonder cloud is born
Of water which is born of cloud
 I thought
I saw the moonlight lying large and calm
Upon the unthrobbing bosom of the earth
As a great diamond glittering on a shroud
A sense of breathlessness stilled all the world
Motion stood dreaming he was changed to Rest
And Life asleep did fancy he was Death
A quick small shadow spotted the white world
Then instantly twas huge and huger grew
By instants till it did oergloom all space
I lifted up mine eyes  O thou just God
I saw a spectre with a million heads
Come frantic downward through the universe
And all the mouths of it were uttering cries
Wherein was a sharp agony and yet
The cries were much like laughs as if Pain laughed
Its myriad lips were blue and sometimes they
Closed fast and only moaned dim sounds that shaped
Themselves to one word Homeless and the stars
Did utter back the moan and the great hills
Did bellow it and then the stars and hills
Bandied the grief o the ghost twixt heaven and earth
The spectre sank and lay upon the air
And brooded level close upon the earth
With all the myriad heads just over me
I glanced in all the eyes and marked that some
Did glitter with a flame of lunacy
And some were soft and false as feigning love
And some were blinking with hypocrisy
And some were overfilmed by sense and some
Blazed with ambitions wild unsteady fire
And some were burnt i the sockets black and some
Were dead as embers when the fire is out
A curious zone circled the Spectres waist
Which seemed with strange device to symbol Time
It was a silvergleaming thread of day
Spiral about a jetblack band of night
This zone seemed ever to contract and all
The frame with momentary spasms heaved
In the strangling traction which did never cease
I cried unto the spectre Time hath bound
Thy body with the fibre of his hours
Then rose a multitude of mocking sounds
And some mouths spat at me and cried thou fool
And some thou liest and some he dreams and then
Some hands uplifted certain bowls they bore
To lips that writhed but drank with eagerness
And some played curious viols shaped like hearts
And stringed with loves to light and ribald tunes
 And other hands slit throats with knives
And others patted all the painted cheeks
In reach and others stole what others had
Unseen or boldly snatched at alien rights
And some o the heads did vie in a foolish game
OF WHICH COULD HOLD ITSELF THE HIGHEST and
OF WHICH ONES NECK WAS STIFF THE LONGEST TIME
 And then the sea in silence wove a veil
Of mist and breathed it upward and about
And waved and wound it softly round the world
And meshed my dream i the vague and endless folds
And a light wind arose and blew these off
And I awoke
 The many heads are priests
That have forgot eternity and Time
 Hath caught and bound them with a withe
Into a fagot huge to burn in hell
 Now if the priesthood put such shame upon
Your cry for leadership can better help
Come out of knighthood
 Lo you smile you boors
You villeins smile at knighthood
 Now thou France
That wert the mother of fair chivalry
Unclose thine eyes unclose thine eyes here see
Here stand a herd of knaves that laugh to scorn
Thy gentlemen
 O contumely hard
O bitterness of last disgrace O sting
That stings the coward knights of lost Poictiers
I would  but now a murmur rose i the crowd
Of angry voices and the friar leapt
From where he stood to preach and pressed a path
Betwixt the mass that way the voices came


 Chapter III

Lord Raoul was riding castleward from field
At left hand rode his lady and at right
His fool whom he loved better and his bird
His fine gerfalcon best beloved of all
Sat hooded on his wrist and gently swayed
To the undulating amble of the horse
Guestknights and huntsmen and a noisy train
Of loyalstomached flatterers and their squires
Clattered in retinue and aped his pace
And timed their talk by his and worked their eyes
By intimation of his glance with great
And drilled precision
 Then said the fool
Twas a brave flight my lord that last one brave
Didst note the heron once did turn about
And show a certain anger with his wing
And make as if he almost dared not quite
To strike the falcon ere the falcon him
A foolish damnable advised bird
Yon heron What Shall herons grapple hawks
God made the herons for the hawks to strike
And hawk and heron made he for lords sport
What then my honeytongued Fool that knowest
Gods purposes what made he fools for
 For
To counsel lords my lord Wilt hear me prove
Fools counsel better than wise mens advice
Aye prove it If thy logic fail wise fool
Ill cause two wise men whip thee soundly
 So
Wise men are prudent prudent men have care
For their own proper interest therefore they
Advise their own advantage not anothers
But fools are careless careless men care not
For their own proper interest therefore they
Advise their friends advantage not their own
Now hear the commentary Cousin Raoul
This fool unselfish counsels thee his lord
Go not through yonder square where as thou seest
Yon herd of villeins cricknecked all with strain
Of gazing upward stand and gaze and take
With open mouth and eye and ear the quips
And heresies of John de Rochetaillade
Lord Raoul half turned him in his saddle round
And looked upon his fool and vouchsafed him
What moiety of fastidious wonderment
A generous nobleness could deign to give
To such humility with eye superb
Where languor and surprise both showed themselves
Each deprecating tother
 Now dear knave
Be kind and tell me  tell me quickly too 
Some proper reasonable ground or cause
Nay tell me but some shadow of some cause
Nay hint me but a thin ghosts dream of cause
So will I thee absolve from being whipped
Why I Lord Raoul should turn my horse aside
From riding by yon pitiful villein gang
Or ay by God from riding oer their heads
If so my humor serve or through their bodies
Or miring fetlocks in their nasty brains
Or doing aught else I will in my Clermont
Do me this grace mine Idiot
 Please thy Wisdom
An thou dost ride through this same gang of boors
Tis my foolsprophecy some ill shall fall
Lord Raoul yon mass of various flesh is fused
And melted quite in one by whitehot words
The friar speaks Sir sawest thou neer sometimes
Thine armorer spit on iron when twas hot
And how the iron flung the insult back
Hissing So this contempt now in thine eye
If it shall fall on yonder heated surface
May bounce back upward Well and then What then
Why if thou cause thy folk to crop some villeins ears
So evil falls and a fool foretells the truth
Or if some erring crossbowbolt should break
Thine unarmed head shot from behind a house
So evil falls and a fool foretells the truth
Well quoth Lord Raoul with languid utterance
Tis very well  and thourt a foolish fool
Nay thou art Follys perfect witless man
Stupidity doth madly dote on thee
And Idiocy doth fight her for thy love
Yet Silliness doth love thee best of all
And while they quarrel snatcheth thee to her
And saith Ah tis my sweetest Nobrains mine
 And tis my mood today some ill shall fall
And there right suddenly Lord Raoul gave rein
And galloped straightway to the crowded square
 What time a strange light flickered in the eyes
Of the calm fool that was not follys gleam
But more like wisdoms smile at plan well laid
And end well compassed In the noise of hoofs
Secure the fool lowmuttered Follys love
So Silliness sweetheart nobrains quoth my Lord
Why how intolerable an ass is he
Whom Silliness sweetheart drives so by the ear
Thou languid lordly most heartbreaking Nought
Thou bastard zero that hast come to power
Nothings right issue failing Thou mere pooh
That Life hath uttered in some moments pet
And then forgot she uttered thee Thou gap
In time thou little notch in circumstance


 Chapter IV

Lord Raoul drew rein with all his company
And urged his horse i the crowd to gain fair view
Of him that spoke and stopped at last and sat
Still underneath where Gris Grillon was laid
And heard somewhile with languid scornful gaze
The friar putting blame on priest and knight
But presently as twere in weariness
He gazed about and then above and so
Made mark of Gris Grillon
 So there old man
Thou hast more brows than legs
 I would quoth Gris
That thou upon a certain time I wot
Hadst had less legs and bigger brows my Lord
Then all the flatterers and their squires cried out
Solicitous with various voice Go to
Old Rogue or Shall I brain him my good Lord
Or So let me but chuck him from his perch
Or Slice his tongue to piece his leg withal
Or Send his eyes to look for his missing arms
But my Lord Raoul was in the mood today
Which craves suggestions simply with a view
To flout them in the face and so waved hand
Backward and stayed the onpressing sycophants
Eager to buy rich praise with bravery cheap
I would know why  he said  thou wishedst me
Less legs and bigger brows and when
 Wouldst know
Learn then cried Gris Grillon and stirred himself
In a great spasm of passion mixed with pain
An thou hadst had more courage and less speed
Then ah my God then could not I have been
That piteous gibe of a man thou seest I am
Sir having no disease nor any taint
Nor old hereditament of sin or shame
 But feeling the brave bound and energy
Of daring health that leaps along the veins 
As a hart upon his river banks at morn
 Sir wild with the urgings and hot strenuous beats
Of manhoods heart in this fullsinewed breast
Which thou mayst even now discern is mine
 Sir full aware each instant in each day
Of motions of great muscles once were mine
And thrill of tense thewknots and stinging sense
Of nerves nice capable and delicate
 Sir visited each hour by passions great
That lack all instrument of utterance
Passion of love  that hath no arm to curve
Passion of speed  that hath no limb to stretch
Yea even that poor feeling of desire
Simply to turn me from this side to that
Which brooded on into wild passion grows
By reason of the impotence that broods
Balked of its end and unachievable
Without assistance of some foreign arm
 Sir moved and thrilled like any perfect man
O trebly moved and thrilled since poor desires
That are of small import to happy men
Who easily can compass them to me
Become mere hopeless Heavens or actual Hells
 Sir strengthened so with manhoods seasoned soul
I lie in this damned cradle day and night
Still still so still my Lord less than a babe
In powers but more than any man in needs
Dreaming with open eye of days when men
Have fallen cloven through steel and bone and flesh
At single strokes of this  of that big arm
Once wielded aught a mortal arm might wield
Waking a prey to any foolish gnat
That wills to conquer my defenceless brow
And sit thereon in triumph hounded ever
By small necessities of barest use
Which since I cannot compass them alone
Do snarl my helplessness into mine ear
Howling behind me that I have no hands
And yelping round me that I have no feet
So that my heart is stretched by tiny ills
That are so much the larger that I knew
In bygone days how trifling small they were
 Dungeoned in wicker strong as twere in stone
 Fast chained with nothing firmer than with steel
 Captive in limb yet free in eye and ear
Sole tenant of this puny Hell in Heaven
 And this  all this  because I was a man
For in the battle  ha thou knowst paleface
When that the four great English horsemen bore
So bloodily on thee I leapt to front
To front of thee  of thee  and fought four blades
Thinking to win thee time to snatch thy breath
And by a rearing forehoof stricken down
 Mine eyes through blood my brain through pain
 Midst of a dim hot uproar fainting down 
Were ware of thee far rearward fleeing Hound


 Chapter V

Then as the passion of old Gris Grillon
A wave swift swelling grew to highest height
And snapped a foaming consummation forth
With salty hissing came the friar through
The mass A stillness of white faces wrought
A transient death on all the hands and breasts
Of all the crowd and men and women stood
One instant fixed as they had died upright
Then suddenly Lord Raoul rose up in selle
And thrust his dagger straight upon the breast
Of Gris Grillon to pin him to the wall
But ere steelpoint met flesh tall Jacques Grillon
Had leapt straight upward from the earth and in
The selfsame act had whirled his bow by end
With mighty whirr about his head and struck
The dagger with so featly stroke and full
That blade flew up and hilt flew down and left
Lord Raoul unfriended of his weapon
 Then
The fool cried shrilly Shall a knight of France
Go stabbing his own cattle And Lord Raoul
Calm with a changing mood sat still and called
Here huntsmen tis my will ye seize the hind
That broke my dagger bind him to this tree
And slice both ears to hairbreadth of his head
To be his bloody token of regret
That he hath put them to so foul employ
As catching villainous breath of strolling priests
That mouth at knighthood and defile the Church
The knife      Rest of line lost
To place the edge    Rest of line lost
Mary the blood it oozes sluggishly
Scorning to come at call of blade so base
Sathanas He that cuts the ear has left
The blade sticking at midway for to turn
 And ask the Duke if tis not done
Thus far with nice precision and the Duke
Leans down to see and cries tis marvellous nice
Shaved as thou wert earbarber by profession
Whereat one witling cries tis monstrous fit
In sooth a shavenpated priest should have
A shaveneared audience and another
Give thanks thou Jacques to this most gracious Duke
That rids thee of the lifelong dread of loss
Of thy two ears by cropping them at once
And now henceforth full safely thou mayst dare
The powerfullest Lord in France to touch
An ear of thine and now the knave o the knife
Seizes the handle to commence again and saws
And   ha Lift up thine head O Henry Friend
Tis Marie walking midway of the street
As she had just stepped forth from out the gate
Of the very very Heaven where God is
Still glittering with the Godshine on her Look
And there right suddenly the fool looked up
And saw the crowd divided in two ranks
Raoul palestricken as a man that waits
Gods first remark when he hath died into
Gods sudden presence saw the cropping knave
Apause with knife in hand the wondering folk
All straining forward with roundringed eyes
And Gris Grillon calm smiling while he prayed
The Holy Virgins blessing
 Down the lane
Betwixt the hedging bodies of the crowd
Part of line lost     majesty
Part of line lost   a spirit pacing on the top
Of springy clouds and bore straight on toward
The Duke On him her eyes burned steadily
With such gray fires of heavenhot command
As Dawn burns Night away with and she held
Her white forefinger quivering aloft
At greatest armslength of her dainty arm
In menace sweeter than a kiss could be
And terribler than sudden whispers are
That come from lips unseen in sunlit room
So with the spell of all the Powers of Sense
That eer have swayed the savagery of hot blood
Raying from her whole body beautiful
She held the eyes and wills of all the crowd
Then from the numbed hand of him that cut
The knife dropped down and the quick fool stole in
And snatched and deftly severed all the withes
Unseen and Jacques burst forth into the crowd
And then the mass completed the long breath
They had forgot to draw and surged upon
The centre where the maiden stood with sound
Of multitudes of blessings and Lord Raoul
Rode homeward silent and most pale and strange
Deepwrapt in moody fits of hot and cold
 End of Chapter V

Song for The Jacquerie


 May the maiden
 Violetladen
Out of the violet sea
 Comes and hovers
 Over lovers
Over thee Marie and me
 Over me and thee

 Day the stately
 Sunken lately
Into the violet sea
 Backward hovers
 Over lovers
Over thee Marie and me
 Over me and thee

 Night the holy
 Sailing slowly
Over the violet sea
 Stars uncovers
 Over lovers
Stars for thee Marie and me
 Stars for me and thee

Song for The Jacquerie

Betrayal


The sun has kissed the violet sea
 And burned the violet to a rose
O Sea wouldst thou not better be
 Mere violet still Who knows who knows
 Well hides the violet in the wood
 The dead leaf wrinkles her a hood
 And winters ill is violets good
 But the bold glory of the rose
 It quickly comes and quickly goes 
 Red petals whirling in white snows
 Ah me

The sun has burnt the rosered sea
 The rose is turned to ashes gray
O Sea O Sea mightst thou but be
 The violet thou hast been today
 The sun is brave the sun is bright
 The sun is lord of love and light
 But after him it cometh night
 Dim anguish of the lonesome dark 
 Once a girls body stiff and stark
 Was laid in a tomb without a mark
 Ah me

Song for The Jacquerie


 The hound was cuffed the hound was kicked
 O the ears was cropped o the tail was nicked
All Oohooo howled the hound
 The hound into his kennel crept
 He rarely wept he never slept
 His mouth he always open kept
 Licking his bitter wound
 The hound
All Ululo HOWLED THE HOUND

 A star upon his kennel shone
 That showed the hound a meatbare bone
All O hungry was the hound
 The hound had but a churlish wit
 He seized the bone he crunched he bit
 An thou wert Master I had slit
 Thy throat with a huge wound
 Quo hound
All O angry was the hound

 The star in castlewindow shone
 The Master lay abed alone
All Oh ho why not quo hound
 He leapt he seized the throat he tore
 The Master head from neck to floor
 And rolled the head i the kennel door
 And fled and salved his wound
 Good hound
All Ululo HOWLED THE HOUND

The Golden Wedding of Sterling and Sarah Lanier September 27 1868

By the Eldest Grandson



A rainbow span of fifty years
Painted upon a cloud of tears
In blue for hopes and red for fears
 Finds end in a golden hour today
Ah YOU to our childhood the legend told
At the end of the rainbow lies the gold
And now in our thrilling hearts we hold
 The gold that never will pass away

Gold crushed from the quartz of a crystal life
Gold hammered with blows of human strife
Gold burnt in the love of man and wife
 Till it is pure as the very flame
Gold that the miser will not have
Gold that is good beyond the grave
Gold that the patient and the brave
 Amass neglecting praise and blame

O golden hour that caps the time
Since heart to heart like rhyme to rhyme
You stood and listened to the chime
 Of inner bells by spirits rung
That tinkled many a secret sweet
Concerning how two souls should meet
And whispered of Times flying feet
 With a most piquant silver tongue

O golden day  a golden crown
For the kingly heads that bowed not down
To win a smile or scape a frown
 Except the smile and frown of Heaven
Dear heads still dark with raven hair
Dear hearts still white in spite of care
Dear eyes still black and bright and fair
 As any eyes to mortals given

Old parents of a restless race
You miss full many a bonny face
That would have smiled a filial grace
 Around your Golden Wedding wine
But God is good and God is great
His will be done if soon or late
Your dead stand happy in yon Gate
 And call you blessed while they shine

So drop the tear and dry the eyes
Your rainbow glitters in the skies
Heres golden wine young old arise
 With cups as full as our souls we say
Two Hearts that wrought with smiles through tears
This rainbow span of fifty years
Behold how true true love appears
 True gold for your Golden Wedding day

Strange Jokes



Well Death is a huge omnivorous Toad
Grim squatting on a twilight road
He catcheth all that Circumstance
 Hath tossed to him
He curseth all who upward glance
 As lost to him

Once in a whimsey mood he sat
And talked of life in proverbs pat
To Eve in Eden  Death on Life 
 As if he knew
And so he toadied Adams wife
 There in the dew

O dainty dew O morning dew
That gleamed in the worlds first dawn did you
And the sweet grass and manful oaks
 Give lair and rest
To him who toadwise sits and croaks
 His deathbehest

Who fears the hungry Toad Not I
He but unfetters me to fly
The German still when one is dead
 Cries out Der Tod
But pilgrims Christ will walk ahead
 And clear the road

Nirvana



Through seas of dreams and seas of phantasies
Through seas of solitudes and vacancies
And through my Self the deepest of the seas
 I strive to thee Nirvana

Oh long ago the billowflow of sense
Aroused by passions windy vehemence
Upbore me out of depths to heights intense
 But not to thee Nirvana

By waves swept on I learned to ride the waves
I served my masters till I made them slaves
I baffled Death by hiding in his graves
 His watery graves Nirvana

And once I clomb a mountains stony crown
And stood and smiled no smile and frowned no frown
Nor ate nor drank nor slept nor faltered down
 Five days and nights Nirvana

Sunrise and noon and sunset and strange night
And shadow of large clouds and faint starlight
And lonesome Terror stalking round the height
 I minded not Nirvana

The silence ground my soul keen like a spear
My bare thought whetted as a sword cut sheer
Through time and life and flesh and death to clear
 My way unto Nirvana

I slew gross bodies of old ethnic hates
That stirred long racewars betwixt States and States
I stood and scorned these foolish dead debates
 Calmly calmly Nirvana

I smote away the filmy base of Caste
I thrust through antique blood and riches vast
And all big claims of the pretentious Past
 That hindered my Nirvana

Then all fair types of form and sound and hue
Upfloated round my sense and charmed anew
 I waved them back into the void blue
 I love them not Nirvana

And all outrageous ugliness of time
Excess and Blasphemy and squinting Crime
Beset me but I kept my calm sublime
 I hate them not Nirvana

High on the topmost thrilling of the surge
I saw afar two hosts to battle urge
The widows of the victors sang a dirge
 But I wept not Nirvana

I saw two lovers sitting on a star
He kissed her lip she kissed his battlescar
They quarrelled soon and went two ways afar
 O Life I laughed Nirvana

And never a king but had some king above
And never a law to right the wrongs of Love
And ever a fanged snake beneath a dove
 Saw I on earth Nirvana

But I with kingship over kings am free
I love not hate not right and wrong agree
And fangs of snakes and lures of doves to me
 Are vain are vain Nirvana

So by mine inner contemplation long
By thoughts that need no speech nor oath nor song
My spirit soars above the motley throng
 Of days and nights Nirvana

O Suns O Rains O Day and Night O Chance
O Time besprent with sevenhued circumstance
I float above ye all into the trance
 That draws me nigh Nirvana

Gods of small worlds ye little Deities
Of humble Heavens under my large skies
And GovernorSpirits all I rise I rise
 I rise into Nirvana

The storms of Self below me rage and die
On the still bosom of mine ecstasy
A lotus on a lake of balm I lie
 Forever in Nirvana

  The two poems which follow The Raven Days have not 
  been included in earlier editions All three are calls 
  from those desperate years for the South just after the Civil War 
  The reader of today seeing that forlorn period 
  in the just perspective of half a century will not wonder 
  at the tone of anguished remonstrance but rather 
  that so few notes of mourning have come from a poet 
  who missed nothing of what the days of Reconstruction 
  brought to his people 
 




The Raven Days



Our hearths are gone out and our hearts are broken
 And but the ghosts of homes to us remain
And ghastly eyes and hollow sighs give token
 From friend to friend of an unspoken pain

O Raven days dark Raven days of sorrow
 Bring to us in your whetted ivory beaks
Some sign out of the far land of Tomorrow
 Some strip of seagreen dawn some orange streaks

Ye float in dusky files forever croaking
 Ye chill our manhood with your dreary shade
Dumb in the dark not even God invoking
 We lie in chains too weak to be afraid

O Raven days dark Raven days of sorrow
 Will ever any warm light come again
Will ever the lit mountains of Tomorrow
 Begin to gleam athwart the mournful plain

Our Hills



 Dear MotherEarth
 Of Titan birth
Yon hills are your large breasts and often I
Have climbed to their topnipples fain and dry
To drink my mothersmilk so near the sky

 O ye hillstains
 Red for all rains
The blood that made you has all bled for us
The hearts that paid you are all dead for us
The trees that shade you groan with lead for us

 And O hillsides
 Like giants brides
Ye sleep in ravinerumpled draperies
And weep your springs in tearful memories
Of days that stained your robes with stains like these

 Sleep on ye hills
 Weep on ye rills
The stainers have decreed the stains shall stay
They chain the hands might wash the stains away
They wait with cold hearts till we rue the day

 O MotherEarth
 Of Titan birth
Thy mothersmilk is curdled with aloe
 Like hills Men lift calm heads through any woe
And weep but bow not an inch for any foe

 Thou Sorrowheight
 We climb by night
Thou hast no helldeep chasm save Disgrace
To stoop will fling us down its fouled space
Stand proud The Dawn will meet us face to face
For down steep hills the Dawn loves best to race




Laughter in the Senate



In the South lies a lonesome hungry Land
He huddles his rags with a cripples hand
He mutters prone on the barren sand
 What time his heart is breaking

He lifts his bare head from the ground
He listens through the gloom around
The winds have brought him a strange sound
 Of distant merrymaking

Comes now the Peace so long delayed
Is it the cheerful voice of Aid
Begins the time his heart has prayed
 When men may reap and sow

Ah God Back to the cold earths breast
The sages chuckle oer their jest
Must they to give a people rest
 Their dainty wit forego

The tyrants sit in a stately hall
They jibe at a wretched peoples fall
The tyrants forget how fresh is the pall
 Over their dead and ours

Look how the senators ape the clown
And don the motley and hide the gown
But yonder a fastrising frown
 On the peoples forehead lowers

Baby Charley



Hes fast asleep See how O Wife
Nights finger on the lip of life
Bids whist the tongue so prattlerife
 Of busy Baby Charley

One arm stretched backward round his head
Five little toes from out the bed
Just showing like five rosebuds red
  So slumbers Baby Charley

Heavenlights I know are beaming through
Those lucent eyelids veined with blue
That shut away from mortal view
 Large eyes of Baby Charley

O sweet SleepAngel throned now
On the round glory of his brow
Wave thy wing and waft my vow
 Breathed over Baby Charley

I vow that my heart when death is nigh
Shall never shiver with a sigh
For act of hand or tongue or eye
 That wronged my Baby Charley

A SeaShore Grave To M J L

By Sidney and Clifford Lanier



O wish thats vainer than the plash
 Of these wavewhimsies on the shore
Give us a pearl to fill the gash 
 God let our dead friend live once more

O wish thats stronger than the stroke
 Of yelling wave and snapping levin
God lift us oer the Last Days smoke
 All white to Thee and her in Heaven

O wish thats swifter than the race
 Of wave and wind in sea and sky
Lets take the gravecloth from her face
 And fall in the grave and kiss and die

Look High above a glittering calm
 Of sea and sky and kingly sun
She shines and smiles and waves a palm 
 And now we wish  Thy will be done

Souls and RainDrops



Light raindrops fall and wrinkle the sea
Then vanish and die utterly
One would not know that raindrops fell
If the round seawrinkles did not tell

So souls come down and wrinkle life
And vanish in the fleshsea strife
One might not know that souls had place
Weret not for the wrinkles in lifes face




Nilsson



A rose of perfect red embossed
With silver sheens of crystal frost
Yet warm nor life nor fragrance lost

High passion throbbing in a sphere
That Art hath wrought of diamond clear
 A great heart beating in a tear

The listening soul is full of dreams
That shape the wondrousvarying themes
As cries of men or plash of streams

Or noise of summer raindrops round
That patter daintily aground
With hints of heaven in the sound

Or noble windtones chanting free
Through morningskies across the sea
Wild hymns to some strange majesty

O if one trope clearcut and keen
May type the art of Songs best queen
Whitehot of soul whitechaste of mien

On Musics heart doth Nilsson dwell
As if a Swedish snowflake fell
Into a glowing flowerbell

Night and Day



The innocent sweet Day is dead
Dark Night hath slain her in her bed
O Moors are as fierce to kill as to wed
  Put out the light said he

A sweeter light than ever rayed
From star of heaven or eye of maid
Has vanished in the unknown Shade
  Shes dead shes dead said he

Now in a wild sad aftermood
The tawny Night sits still to brood
Upon the dawntime when he wooed
  I would she lived said he

Starmemories of happier times
Of loving deeds and lovers rhymes
Throng forth in silvery pantomimes
  Come back O Day said he

A Birthday Song To S G



For ever wave for ever float and shine
Before my yearning eyes oh dream of mine
Wherein I dreamed that time was like a vine

A creeping rose that clomb a height of dread
Out of the sea of Birth all filled with dead
Up to the brilliant cloud of Death oerhead

This vine bore many blossoms which were years
Their petals red with joy or bleached by tears
Waved to and fro i the winds of hopes and fears

Here all men clung each hanging by his spray
Anon one dropped his neighbor gan to pray
And so they clung and dropped and prayed alway

But I did mark one latelyopened bloom
Wherefrom arose a visible perfume
That wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom

And rose  an odor by a spirit haunted 
And drew me upward with a speed enchanted
Swift floating by wild sea or sky undaunted

Straight through the cloud of death where men are free
I gained a height and stayed and bent my knee
Then glowed my cloud and broke and unveiled thee

O flowerborn and flowersouled I said
Be the yearbloom that breathed thee ever red
Nor wither yellow down among the dead

May all that cling to sprays of time like me
Be sweetly wafted over sky and sea
By rosebreaths shrining maidens like to thee

Then while we sat upon the height afar
Came twilight like a lover late from war
With soft winds fluting to his evening star

And the shy stars grew bold and scattered gold
And chanting voices ancient secrets told
And an acclaim of angels earthward rolled

Resurrection



Sometimes in morning sunlights by the river
 Where in the early fall long grasses wave
Light winds from over the moorland sink and shiver
 And sigh as if just blown across a grave

And then I pause and listen to this sighing
 I look with strange eyes on the wellknown stream
I hear wild birthcries uttered by the dying
 I know men waking who appear to dream

Then from the waterlilies slow uprises
 The still vast face of all the life I know
Changed now and full of wonders and surprises
 With fire in eyes that once were glazed with snow

Fair now the brows old Pain had erewhile wrinkled
 And peace and strength about the calm mouth dwell
Clean of the ashes that Repentance sprinkled
 The meek head poises like a flowerbell

All the old scars of wanton wars are vanished
 And what blue bruises grappling Sense had left
And sad remains of redder stains are banished
 And the dim blotch of heartcommitted theft

O still vast vision of transfigured features
 Unvisited by secret crimes or dooms
Remain remain amid these watercreatures
 Stand shine among yon waterlily blooms

For eighteen centuries ripple down the river
 And windy times the stalks of empires wave
 Let the winds come from the moor and sigh and shiver
 Fain fain am I O Christ to pass the grave




To 



 The Day was dying his breath
Wavered away in a hectic gleam
And I said if Lifes a dream and Death
And Love and all are dreams  Ill dream

 A mist came over the bay
Like as a dream would over an eye
The mist was white and the dream was grey
And both contained a human cry

 The burthen whereof was Love
And it filled both mist and dream with pain
And the hills below and the skies above
Were touched and uttered it back again

 The mist broke down the rift
A kind ray shot from a holy star
Then my dream did waver and break and lift 
Through it O Love shone thy face afar

 So Boyhood sets comes Youth
A painful night of mists and dreams
That broods till Loves exquisite truth
The star of a mornclear manhood beams

The Wedding



O marriagebells your clamor tells
 Two weddings in one breath
SHE marries whom her love compels
  And I wed Goodman Death
My brain is blank my tears are red
Listen O God  I will he said 
And I would that I were dead
Come groomsman Grief and bridesmaid Pain
Come and stand with a ghastly twain
My Bridegroom Death is come oer the meres
To wed a bride with bloody tears

The Palm and the Pine

From the German of Heine



In the far North stands a Pinetree lone
 Upon a wintry height
It sleeps around it snows have thrown
 A covering of white

It dreams forever of a Palm
 That far i the Morningland
Stands silent in a most sad calm
 Midst of the burning sand

Spring Greeting

From the German of Herder



All faintly through my soul today
As from a bell that far away
Is tinkled by some frolic fay
 Floateth a lovely chiming
Thou magic bell to many a fell
And many a wintersaddened dell
Thy tongue a tale of Spring doth tell
 Too passionatesweet for rhyming

Chime out thou little song of Spring
Float in the blue skies ravishing
Thy songoflife a joy doth bring
 Thats sweet albeit fleeting
Float on the Springwinds een to my home
And when thou to a rose shalt come
That hath begun to show her bloom
 Say I send her greeting

The Tournament



 Joust First


 I

Bright shone the lists blue bent the skies
 And the knights still hurried amain
To the tournament under the ladies eyes
 Where the jousters were Heart and Brain

 II

Flourished the trumpets entered Heart
 A youth in crimson and gold
Flourished again Brain stood apart
 Steelarmored dark and cold

 III

Hearts palfrey caracoled gayly round
 Heart tralirad merrily
But Brain sat still with never a sound
 So cynicalcalm was he

 IV

Hearts helmetcrest bore favors three
 From his ladys white hand caught
While Brain wore a plumeless casque not he
 Or favor gave or sought

 V

The herald blew Heart shot a glance
 To find his ladys eye
But Brain gazed straight ahead his lance
 To aim more faithfully

 VI

They charged they struck both fell both bled
 Brain rose again ungloved
Heart dying smiled and faintly said
 My love to my beloved

 Joust Second


 I

Amany sweet eyes wept and wept
 Amany bosoms heaved again
Amany dainty dead hopes slept
 With yonder Heartknight prone o the plain

 II

Yet stars will burn through any mists
 And the ladies eyes through rains of fate
Still beamed upon the bloody lists
 And lit the joust of Love and Hate

 III

O strange or ere a trumpet blew
 Or ere a challengeword was given
A knight leapt down i the lists none knew
 Whether he sprang from earth or heaven

 IV

His cheek was soft as a lilybud
 His grey eyes calmed his youths alarm
Nor helm nor hauberk nor even a hood
 Had he to shield his life from harm

 V

No falchion from his baldric swung
 He wore a white rose in its place
No dagger at his girdle hung
 But only an olivebranch for grace

 VI

And Come thou poor mistaken knight
 Cried Love unarmed yet dauntless there
Come on God pity thee  I fight
 Sans sword sans shield yet Hate beware

 VII

Spurred furious Hate he foamed at mouth
 His breath was hot upon the air
His breath scorched souls as a dry drought
 Withers green trees and burns them bare

 VIII

Straight drives he at his enemy
 His hairy hands grip lance in rest
His lance it gleams full bitterly
 God  gleams truepoint on Loves bare breast

 IX

Loves grey eyes glow with a heavenheat
 Love lifts his hand in a saintly prayer
Look Hate hath fallen at his feet
 Look Hate hath vanished in the air

 X

Then all the throng looked kind on all
 Eyes yearned lips kissed dumb souls were freed
Two magic maids hands lifted a pall
 And the dead knight Heart sprang on his steed

 XI

Then Love cried Break me his lance each knight
 Ye shall fight for bloodathirst Fame no more
And the knights all doffed their mailed might
 And dealt out dole on dole to the poor

 XII

Then doveflights sanctified the plain
 And hawk and sparrow shared a nest
And the great sea opened and swallowed Pain
 And out of this watergrave floated Rest

The Dying Words of Stonewall Jackson

 Order A P Hill to prepare for battle
 Tell Major Hawks to advance the Commissary train
 Let us cross the river and rest in the shade



The stars of Night contain the glittering Day
And rain his glory down with sweeter grace
Upon the dark Worlds grand enchanted face 
 All loth to turn away

And so the Day about to yield his breath
Utters the stars unto the listening Night
To stand for burning faretheewells of light
 Said on the verge of death

O herolife that lit us like the sun
O herowords that glittered like the stars
And stood and shone above the gloomy wars
 When the herolife was done

The phantoms of a battle came to dwell
I the fitful vision of his dying eyes 
Yet even in battledreams he sends supplies
 To those he loved so well

His army stands in battleline arrayed
His couriers fly alls done now God decide
 And not till then saw he the Other Side
 Or would accept the shade

Thou Land whose sun is gone thy stars remain
Still shine the words that miniature his deeds
O thricebeloved whereer thy great heart bleeds
 Solace hast thou for pain

To Wilhelmina



A white face drooping on a bending neck
 A tuberose that with heavy petal curves
 Her stem a foambell on a wave that swerves
Back from the undulating vessels deck

From out the whitest cloud of summer steals
 The wildest lightning from this face of thine
 Thy soul a fireofheaven warm and fine
In marvellous flashes its fair self reveals

As when one gazes from the summer sea
 On some far gossamer cloud with straining eye
 Fearing to see it vanish in the sky
So floating wandering CloudSoul I watch thee

WeddingHymn



Thou God whose high eternal Love
 Is the only blue sky of our life
Clear all the Heaven that bends above
 The liferoad of this man and wife

May these two lives be but one note
 In the worlds strangesounding harmony
Whose sacred music eer shall float
 Through every discord up to Thee

As when from separate stars two beams
 Unite to form one tender ray
As when two sweet but shadowy dreams
 Explain each other in the day

So may these two dear hearts one light
 Emit and each interpret each
Let an angel come and dwell tonight
 In this dear doubleheart and teach

In the Foam



Life swelleth in a whitening wave
And dasheth thee and me apart
I sweep out seaward  be thou brave
 And reach the shore Sweetheart

Beat back the backwardthrusting sea
Thy weak white arm his blows may thwart
Christ buffet the wild surge for thee
 Till thourt ashore Sweetheart

Ah now thy face grows dim apace
And seems of yon white foam a part
Canst hear me through the waterbass
 Cry To the Shore Sweetheart

Now Christ thee soothe upon the Shore
My lissomearmed seaBritomart
I sweep out seaward never more
 To find the Shore Sweetheart

Barnacles



My soul is sailing through the sea
But the Past is heavy and hindereth me
The Past hath crusted cumbrous shells
That hold the flesh of cold seamells
 About my soul
The huge waves wash the high waves roll
Each barnacle clingeth and worketh dole
 And hindereth me from sailing

Old Past let go and drop i the sea
Till fathomless waters cover thee
For I am living but thou art dead
Thou drawest back I strive ahead
 The Day to find
Thy shells unbind Night comes behind
I needs must hurry with the wind
 And trim me best for sailing

Night



Fair is the wedded reign of Night and Day
Each rules a half of earth with different sway
Exchanging kingdoms East and West alway

Like the round pearl that Egypt drunk in wine
The sun half sinks i the brimming rosy brine
The wild Night drinks all up how her eyes shine

Now the swift sail of straining life is furled
And through the stillness of my soul is whirled
The throbbing of the hearts of half the world

I hear the cries that follow Birth and Death
I hear huge Pestilence draw his vaporous breath
Beware prepare or else ye die he saith

I hear a haggard student turn and sigh
I hear men begging Heaven to let them die
And drowning all a wildeyed womans cry

So Night takes toll of Wisdom as of Sin
The students and the drunkards cheek is thin
But flesh is not the prize we strive to win

Now airy swarms of fluttering dreams descend
On souls like birds on trees and have no end
O God from vulturedreams my soul defend

Let fall on Her a roseleaf rain of dreams
All passionatesweet as are the loving beams
Of starlight on the glimmering woods and streams

June Dreams in January



So pulse and pulse thou rhythmichearted Noon
 That liest largelimbed curved along the hills
In languid palpitation half aswoon
 With ardors and sunloves and subtle thrills

Throb Beautiful while the fervent hours exhale
 As kisses faintblown from thy fingertips
Up to the sun that turn him passionpale
 And then as red as any virgins lips

O tender Darkness when Juneday hath ceased
  Faint Odor from the dayflowers crushing born
 Dim visible Sigh out of the mournful East
 That cannot see her lord again till morn

And many leaves broadpalmed towards the sky
 To catch the sacred raining of starlight
And pallid petals fain all fain to die
 Soulstung by too keen passion of the night

And shortbreathd winds under yon gracious moon
 Doing mild errands for mild violets
Or carrying sighs from the red lips of June
 What aimless way the odorcurrent sets

And stars ringed glittering in whorls and bells
 Or bent along the sky in looped starsprays
Or vinewound with bright grapes in panicles
 Or brambletangled in a sweetest maze

Or lying like young lilies in a lake
 About the great white Lotus of the moon
Or blown and drifted as if winds should shake
 Star blossoms down from silver stems too soon

Or budding thick about full open stars
 Or clambering shyly up cloudlattices
Or trampled pale in the red path of Mars
 Or trimset in quaint gardeners fantasies

And long June nightsounds crooned among the leaves
 And whispered confidence of dark and green
And murmurs in old moss about old eaves
 And tinklings floating over watersheen

Then he that wrote laid down his pen and sighed
And straightway came old Scorn and Bitterness
Like Hunnish kings out of the barbarous land
And camped upon the transient Italy
That he had dreamed to blossom in his soul
Ill date this dream he said so Given these
On this the coldest night in all the year
From this the meanest garret in the world
In this the greatest city in the land
To you the richest folk this side of death
By one the hungriest poet under heaven
 Writ while his candle sputtered in the gust
And while his last last ember died of cold
And while the mortal ice i the air made free
Of all his bones and bit and shrunk his heart
And while soft Luxury made show to strike
Her gloved hands together and to smile
What time her weary feet unconsciously
Trode wheels that lifted Avarice to power
 And while moreover  O thou God thou God 
His worshipful sweet wife sat still afar
Within the village whence she sent him forth
Into the town to make his name and fame
Waiting all confident and proud and calm
Till he should make for her his name and fame
Waiting  O Christ how keen this cuts  largeeyed
With Baby Charley till her husband make
For her and him a poets name and fame
 Read me he cried and rose and stamped his foot
Impatiently at Heaven read me this
Putting th inquiry full in the face of God
Why can we poets dream us beauty so
But cannot dream us bread Why now can I
Make aye create this fervid throbbing June
Out of the chill chill matter of my soul
Yet cannot make a poorest pennyloaf
Out of this same chill matter no not one
For Mary though she starved upon my breast
 And then he fell upon his couch and sobbed
And late just when his heart leaned oer
The very edge of breaking fain to fall
God sent him sleep
 There came his roomfellow
Stout Dick the painter saw the written dream
Read scratched his curly pate smiled winked fell on
The poem in bighearted comic rage
Quick folded thrust in envelope addressed
To him the criticgod that sitteth grim
And giantgrisly on the stone causeway
That leadeth to his magazine and fame
 Him by due mail the little Dream of June
Encountered growling and at unawares
Stole in upon his poembattered soul
So that he smiled  then shook his head upon t
 Then growled then smiled again till at the last
As one that deadly sinned against his will
He writ upon the margin of the Dream
A wondrous wondrous word that in a day
Did turn the fleeting song to very bread
 Whereat Dick Painter leapt the poet wept
And Mary slept with happy drops agleam
Upon long lashes of her serene eyes
From twentieth reading of her poets news
Quicksent O sweet my Sweet to dream is power
And I can dream thee bread and dream thee wine
And I will dream thee robes and gems dear Love
To clothe thy holy loveliness withal
And I will dream thee here to live by me
Thee and my little man thou holdst at breast
 Come Name come Fame and kiss my Sweethearts feet

Notes to Poems






 I Sunrise

Sunrise Mr Laniers latest completed poem was written
while his sun of life seemed fairly at the setting
and the hand which first pencilled its lines had not strength
to carry nourishment to the lips

The three Hymns of the Marshes which open this collection
are the only written portions of a series of six Marsh Hymns
that were designed by the author to form a separate volume

The Song of the Marshes At Sunset does not belong to this group
but is inserted among the Hymns as forming a true accord with them


 IV The Marshes of Glynn

The salt marshes of Glynn County Georgia immediately around
the seacoast city of Brunswick


Clover

Clover is placed as the initial poem of a volume which was left
in orderly arrangement among the authors papers His own grouping
in that volume has been followed as far as possible in this fuller collection


The MockingBird

     yon trim Shakespeare on the tree

leads back almost twenty years from its writing
to the poets college notebook where we find the boy reflecting
A poet is the mockingbird of the spiritual universe
In him are collected all the individual songs of all individual natures


Corn

Corn will hold a distinct interest for those who study
the gathering forces in the authors growth for it was the first outcome
of his consciouslydeveloping artlife This life the musicians and poets
he entered upon  after years of patient denial and suppression 
in September 1873 uncertain of his powers but determined to give them wing

His fieldwardfaring eyes took harvest among the stately cornranks
in a portion of middle Georgia sixty miles to the north of Macon
It is a high tract of country from which one looks across the lower reaches
to the distant Blue Ridge mountains whose wholesome breath all unobstructed
here blends with the woodsodors of the beech the hickory and the muscadine
a part of a range recalled elsewhere by Mr Lanier as that ample stretch
of generous soil where the Appalachian ruggednesses calm themselves
into pleasant hills before dying quite away into the seaboard levels 
where a man can find such temperances of heaven and earth 
enough of struggle with nature to draw out manhood with enough of bounty
to sanction the struggle  that a more exquisite coadaptation
of all blessed circumstances for mans life need not be sought


My Springs

Of this newlywritten poem Mr Lanier says in a letter of March 1874
Of course since I have written it to print I cannot make it such
as I desire in artistic design for the forms of today
require a certain trim smugness and cleanshaven propriety
in the face and dress of a poem and I must win a hearing
by conforming in some degree to these tyrannies with a view
to overturning them in the future Written so it is not nearly so beautiful
as I would have it and I therefore have another still in my heart
which I will some day write for myself


 VII A Song of Love

A Song of Love like Betrayal belongs to the early plan
of The Jacquerie It was written for one of the Fools songs and
after several recastings took its present shape in 1879


To Nannette FalkAuerbach

This sonnet was originally written in the German and published
in a German daily of Baltimore while the authors translation
appeared at the same time in the Baltimore Gazette


To Our MockingBird

The history of this birds life is given at length under the title of Bob
in The Independent of August 3 1882 and will show that he deserved
to be immortal  as we hope he is


Ode to the Johns Hopkins University

     the soaring geniusd Sylvester
 That earlier loosed the knot great Newton tied

An algebraic theorem announced by Newton was demonstrated and extended
by Sylvester  Sidney Lanier


A Ballad of Trees and the Master

A Ballad of Trees and the Master was conceived as an interlude
of the latest Hymn of the Marshes Sunrise although written earlier
In the authors first copy and first revision of that Hymn
the Ballad was incorporated following the invocation to the trees
which closes with

 And there oh there
 As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air
 Pray me a myriad prayer

In Mr Laniers final copy the Ballad is omitted
It was one of several interludes which he at first designed
but for some reason afterwards abandoned


To My Class On Certain Fruits and Flowers Sent Me in Sickness

A class in English Literature composed of young girls
who had been studying with Mr Lanier The Knightes Tale of Chaucer

The sonnet On Violets Wafers was addressed to a member of the same class
and is similarly conceived


Under the Cedarcroft Chestnut

This chestnuttree at Cedarcroft the estate of Mr Bayard Taylor
in Pennsylvania is estimated to be more than eight hundred years old
 Sidney Lanier 1877

Hard by stood its mate apparently somewhat younger
It is related in a letter of 1882 from Mrs Taylor that in 1880
a year after Mr Taylors death one of these majestic trees
gave the first signs of decay while his comrade lingered two years longer 
to follow as closely the footsteps of Mr Lanier the two
faithfulhearted to their master and to him who sang of them


A Florida Ghost

The incidents recorded of this storm are matter of history
in and around Tampa


Nine from Eight

The local expression under the hack is kindly explained
by an authority in middle Georgia dialect Richard Malcolm Johnston
author of The Dukesborough Tales and other Georgia stories He says

Under the hack is a wellknown phrase among the countrypeople
and is applied generally in a humorous sense to those who have been cowed
by any accident A man who is overruled by his wife
I have often heard described as under the hack Shes got him
under the hack So when a man has lost spirit from any cause
he is said to be under the hack The phrase is possibly derived
from hackle an instrument used in the breaking of flax


Thars more in the Man than thar is in the Land

Jones designates Jones County Ga one of the counties
adjoining Bibb County in which Macon is located


The Jacquerie A Fragment

Although The Jacquerie remained a fragment for thirteen years
Mr Laniers interest in the subject never abated Far on in this interval
he is found planning for leisure to work out in romance
the story of that savage insurrection of the French peasantry
which the Chronicles of Froissart had impressed upon his boyish imagination


To 

The era of versewriting with Mr Lanier reopens in this dream
of the Virginia bay where poets reveries and wars awakenings
continually alternated

He presents it for a friends criticism  at the age of twentyone 
in these words I send you a little poem which sang itself through me
the other day Tis the first Ive written in many years


Night

This poem was not published by the writer and the simile of the second verse
was appropriated to An Evening Song This partial repetition 
like that of portions of The Tournament and of A Dream of June
which occur in the Psalm of the West  will be pardoned as affording
a favorable opportunity to observe Mr Laniers growth in artistic form






The Centennial Cantata






The Centennial Meditation of Columbia 17761876 A Cantata

 Musical Annotations in angled brackets precede each section



 Full chorus sober measured and yet majestic progressions of chords

From this hundredterraced height
Sight more large with nobler light
Ranges down yon towering years
Humbler smiles and lordlier tears
 Shine and fall shine and fall
While old voices rise and call
Yonder where the toandfro
Weltering of my LongAgo
Moves about the moveless base
Far below my restingplace

 Chorus the sea and the winds mingling their voices with human sighs

Mayflower Mayflower slowly hither flying
Trembling westward oer yon balking sea
Hearts within Farewell dear England sighing
Winds without But dear in vain replying
Graylippd waves about thee shouted crying
 No It shall not be

 Quartette a meagre and despairing minor

Jamestown out of thee 
Plymouth thee  thee Albany 
Winter cries Ye freeze away
Fever cries Ye burn away
Hunger cries Ye starve away
Vengeance cries Your graves shall stay

 Full chorus return of the motive of the second movement
 but worked up with greater fury to the climax of the shout
 at the last line

Then old Shapes and Masks of Things
Framed like Faiths or clothed like Kings
Ghosts of Goods once fleshed and fair
Grown foul Bads in alien air 
War and his most noisy lords
Tongued with lithe and poisoned swords 
Error Terror Rage and Crime
All in a windy night of time
Cried to me from land and sea
 No Thou shalt not be

 A rapid and intense whisperchorus

 Hark
Huguenots whispering yea in the dark
Puritans answering yea in the dark
Yea like an arrow shot true to his mark
Darts through the tyrannous heart of Denial
Patience and Labor and solemnsouled Trial
 Foiled still beginning
 Soiled but not sinning
Toil through the stertorous death of the Night
Toil when wild brotherwars newdark the Light
Toil and forgive and kiss oer and replight

 Chorus of jubilation until the appeal of the last two lines
 introduces a tone of doubt it then sinks to pianissimo

Now Praise to Gods oftgranted grace
Now Praise to Mans undaunted face
Despite the land despite the sea
I was I am and I shall be 
How long Good Angel O how long
Sing me from Heaven a mans own song

 Basso solo the good Angel replies

Long as thine Art shall love true love
Long as thy Science truth shall know
Long as thine Eagle harms no Dove
Long as thy Law by law shall grow
Long as thy God is God above
Thy brother every man below
So long dear Land of all my love
Thy name shall shine thy fame shall glow

 Full chorus jubilation and welcome

O Music from this height of time my Word unfold
In thy large signals all mens hearts Mans heart behold
Midheaven unroll thy chords as friendly flags unfurled
And wave the worlds best lovers welcome to the world






Note to the Cantata



The annotated musical directions which here accompany The Cantata
arranged for the composers use were first sent with the newlycompleted text
in a private letter to Mr Gibson Peacock of Philadelphia

I am enabled to give these annotations and the authors own introduction
to his work through the kindness of Mr Peacock the friend who
while yet an entire stranger awakened and led the public recognition
of Mr Laniers place in the world of art M D L


 Baltimore January 18 1876

    The enclosed will show you partly what I have been doing   
The Centennial Commission has invited me to write a poem
which shall serve as the text for a Cantata the music to be by Dudley Buck
of New York to be sung at the opening of the Exhibition
under Thomas direction    Ive written the enclosed
Necessarily I had to think out the musical conceptions as well as the poem
and I have briefly indicated these along the margin of each movement
I have tried to make the whole as simple and as candid
as a melody of Beethovens at the same time expressing
the largest ideas possible and expressing them in such a way
as could not be offensive to any modern soul I particularly hope
youll like the Angels song where I have endeavored to convey
in one line each the philosophies of Art of Science of Power
of Government of Faith and of Social Life Of course I shall not expect
that this will instantly appeal to tastes peppered and salted
by certain of our contemporary writers but one cannot forget Beethoven
and somehow all my inspiration came in these large and artless forms
in simple Saxon words in unpretentious and purely intellectual conceptions
while nevertheless I felt all through the necessity of making
a genuine song  and not a rhymed set of good adages  out of it
I adopted the trochees of the first movement because they COMPEL
a measured sober and meditative movement of the mind
and because too they are not the genius of our language
When the troubles cease and the land emerges as a distinct unity
then I fall into our native iambics   


 Baltimore January 25 1876

My Dear Friend  Your praise and your wifes give me a world of comfort
I really do not believe anything was ever written under an equal number
of limitations and when I first came to know all the conditions of the poem
I was for a moment inclined to think that no genuine work
could be produced under them

As for the friend who was the cause of the compliment it was directly
Mr Taylor    INDIRECTLY YOU are largely concerned in it   
I fancy all this must have been owing much to the reputation
which you set arolling so recently   

So God bless you both

 Your friend S L

Differences between the editions of 1891  1916 printings of 1898  1918



Other than errors resulting from corruption of the plates over 20 years
the following differences are the only changes


1 The 1898 copy was printed by Trows Printing and Bookbinding Company
New York The 1918 copy was printed by The Scribner Press


2 The dedication of the poem Sunrise at the beginning of this volume
is in the 1918 copy but not in the 1898 copy


3 In the 1898 copy the last line of From the Flats is

 Lull sings a little brook

In the 1918 copy the last line has been changed to

 Bright leaps a living brook


4 In the 1898 copy the 5th line of Laus Mariae is

 So mixt each morn and night rise salient heaps

In the 1918 copy the 5th line has been changed to

 So twixt each morn and night rise salient heaps


5 The footnote to The Raven Days preceding it in this etext
is in the 1918 copy but not in the 1898 copy


6 Two poems Our Hills and Laughter in the Senate
are in the 1918 copy but not in the 1898 copy




Other notes to the text



1 The Charlotte Cushman referred to in several poems
is most likely Charlotte Saunders Cushman an American actress 181676


2 In The Hard Times in Elfland the last line of the 50th stanza
read in the original as

 Thus we become the sport of Fate

This has been changed to

 Thus we became the sport of Fate

This is because in context the past tense seems to fit better
and therefore this change allows the text to flow better
It should not alter the content in any meaningful sense


3 Several mentions are made in this text to Shakespeare
The variant spelling Shakspere was originally used in some occurrences
