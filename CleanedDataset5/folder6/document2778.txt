CHAPTER I

THE NEW COACHMAN

Now you polish up those buckles real good wont you Zekiel I will
say for Fanshaw you could most see your face in the harness always

The young fellow addressed rubbed away at the nickel plating good
humoredly although he had heard enough exhortations in the last
twentyfour hours to chafe somewhat the spirit of youth His mother a
large heavy woman stood over him her face full of care

Its a big change from driving a grocery wagon to driving a gentlemans
carriage Zekiel I do hope you sense it

Youd make a bronze image sense it mother answered the young man
smiling broadly You might sit and sermonize just as well mightnt
you Sittings as cheap as standinghe cast a glance around the clean
spaces of the barn in search of a chairor if youd rather go and
attend to your knitting Ive seen harness before you know

Im not sure as youve ever handled a gentlemans harness in your life
Zekiel Forbes

Its a fact they dont wear em much down Boston way

His mother regarded his shock of light hair with repressed fondness

It was a big responsibility I took when I asked Mr Evringham to let
you try the place she said solemnly and Im going to do my best to
help you fill it It does seem almost a providence the way Fanshaws
livery fits you and if youll hold yourself up I may be partial but
it seems to me you look better in it than he ever did and Im sure if
handsome is as handsome does youll fill it better every way even if
he _was_ a fashionable English coachman Mrs Evringham was so pleased
with his style she tried to have him kept even after hed taken too much
for the second time but Mr Evringham valued his horses too highly for
that I can tell you

Thought the governor was a widower still remarked Ezekiel as his
mother drew forward a battered chair and dusted it with the huge apron
that covered her neat dress She seated herself close to her boy

Of course he is she returned with some asperity Why should he get
married with such a home as hes got Fifteen years Ive kept house for
Mr Evringham I dont believe but what hed say that in all that time
hes never found his beef overdone or a button off his shirts

Humph grunted Ezekiel He looks as if he wouldnt mind hanging you
to the nearest tree if he did I heard tell once that there was a cold
hell as well as a hot one Think says I when the governor was looking
me over the other day Youve set sail for the cold place old boy

Zeke Forbes dont you ever let me hear you say such a thing again
exclaimed Mrs Forbes Mr Evringham is the finest gentleman within one
hundred miles of New York city When a man has spent his life in Wall
Street its bound to show some in his face of course but what comfort
has that man ever known

Pretty scrumptious place hes got here in this park I notice
returned the new coachman

Yes he has a breath of fresh air before he goes to the city and after
he gets back every day Isnt that Essex Maid of his a beauty Mrs
Forbes cast her eyes towards the stalls where the shining flanks of two
horses were visible from her seat by the wideopen doors of the barn
His rides back there among the hillsMrs Forbes waved her hand
vaguely toward the tall trees waving in the spring sunshineare his
one pleasure and he never tires of them You will find the horses
here something different to groom from those common grocery horses in
Boston

Oh I dont know drawled Zekiel teasingly

Then youd better know young man emphatically And Zeke whats
the names of those carriages pointing with sudden energy at two half
shrouded vehicles

How many guesses do I get

Guessing aint going to do Do you know or dont you

Know Why leniently bless your heart mother dont you spose I
know a buggy and a carryall when I see em

Oh you poor benighted grocery boy Mrs Forbes raised her hands
What a mercy I mentioned it Imagine Mrs Evringham hearing you ask if
shed have the buggy or the carryall Zekiel solemnly listen to me
That tall ones a spider and the others a broom There Do you hear
me A _spider_ and a _broom_

Ezekiels merry eyes met the anxious ones with a twinkle

Whod have thought it he responded

Now then Zeke anxiously its my responsibility I recommended you
I want you should say em off as glib as Fanshaw did Now then which is
which

Mother didnt you tell me that the late lamented was not a
prohibitionist

Fanshaw drank like a fish if thats what you mean

Well just because he saw things in this barn you neednt expect me to
Poor chap Spiders and brooms He must have been glad to go

Mrs Forbes earnest expression did not change Zekiel dont you
tease now We havent got time I want you to make such a success of
this that youll stay with me You cant think how I felt when I woke
up this morning and thought the first thing Zekes here Why Ive
scarcely kept acquainted with you for fifteen years Scarcely saw you
except for a few weeks in the summer time Now Ive got you again

I aint the only thing youve got again grinned Zekiel if youre
going to see things same as Fanshaw did

Thus reminded the housekeeper looked back at the phaeton and the
brougham Be a good boy Zeke coaxingly and dont forget now
because Mrs Evringham is a great sticklerand a great sticker too
added Mrs Forbes in a different tone

Who _is_ the old woman if the governor isnt married asked Ezekiel
with not very lively interest She dont seem popular with you

Ill tell you who she is returned his mother in a low emphatic tone
shes just what I saya sticker and an interloper

Hm Shouldnt wonder if the greeneyed monster had got after mamma
soliloquized the youth aloud Somebody else sews on the buttons now
perhaps

Zekiel Forbes we must have an understanding right off Youve got to
joke and tease I spose but it cant be about Mr Evringham This is
like a law of the Medes and Persians and I want you should understand
it The more you see of him the less youll dare to joke about him

I told you he scared me stiff acknowledged Zeke running the harness
through his hands to discover another dingy spot

Well hed _better_ Now I wouldnt gossip to you of my employers
affairsI hope were better than two common servantsbut I want you to
be as loyal to him as I am and to understand a few of the reasons why
he cant go giggling around like some folks

Great Scott interpolated the young coachman Mr Evringham go
giggling around So would Bunker Hill monument

Listen to me Zeke Mr Evringham has had two sons His wife died when
the oldest Lawrence was fifteen Well both those boys disappointed
him Lawrence when he was twentyone married secretly a widow older than
himself who had a little girl named Eloise Mr Evringham made the best
of it and helped him along in business Lawrence became a broker and
had made and lost a fortune when he died at the age of thirtyfive

Broke himself did he remarked the irrepressible Zekiel

Yes he did Here we were living in peace and comfortmy employer
at sixty a man of settled habits and naturally very set in his ways and
satisfied with his home and the way I had run it for him for fifteen
yearswhen three blows fell on him at once Firstly his son Lawrence
failed and was ruined secondly he died and thirdly his widow and her
daughter nineteen years old came here a couple of months ago and settled
on Mr Evringham and here theyve stayed ever since I dont think they
have an idea of going away Mrs Forbess eyes snapped Such an upset
as it was I couldnt show how I felt of course for it was so much
worse for him than it was for me He had never cared for Mrs Evringham
and scarcely knew the girl who called him grandfather without an atom
of right

Hard lines observed Zekiel Does the girl call herself Evringham

Does she with scorn Well I guess she does Of course she was only
four when her mother married Lawrence and I guess she was fond of
her stepfather and he of her because he never had any children but
sometimes I ask myself is it going on forever I only hope Eloisell
get married soon

Zekiel dropped the harness to arrange imaginary curls on his temples
and pat the tie on his muscular neck If shes pretty Im willing he
responded

His mother shook her head absently Then there was Mr Evringhams
younger son a regular roving neerdowell He didnt like Wall Street
and he went West to Chicago He was a rolling stone first in one
position and then in another then he got married and after a few years
he rolled away altogether All Mr Evringham knows about him and his
family is that he had one child Harry wrote a few letters about his
wife Julia and the baby at the time it was born and Mr Evringham sent
a present of money then the letters ceased until one day the wife wrote
him frantically that her husband had disappeared and begged to know
where he was Mr Evringham knew nothing about him and wrote her so and
that is the last hes heard So you see if he looks cold and hard hes
had enough to make him so

Hm ejaculated Zekiel He dont give the impression of lyin awake
nights wondering how his deserted daughterinlaw and the kid make out

Why should he retorted Mrs Forbes sharply His two boys acted as
selfish to him as boys could Hes a disappointed humiliated man in
that proud heart of his Hes been hunted out and harrowed up in this
peaceful retreat when all he asked was to be let alone with his horses
and his golf clubs and I think one daughterinlaws enough under
the circumstances I have some respect for Mrs Harry whoever she is
because she lets him alone In all the long years weve spent here when
he often had no one to talk to but me hes let me have a glimpse of
these things and Ive told you sos youd think right about him and
serve him all the better

Hes got a look in his eyes like cold steel remarked Ezekiel and
lines under em like theyd been drawn with steel and his backs as
flat and straight as if a steel rod took the place of a spine That
thick gray hair and mustache of his might be steel threads

Hes a splendid sight on horseback responded Mrs Forbes devoutly
His sons were neither of em ever the man he is Id like to protect
him from being imposed upon if such a thing was possible

Sho drawled Zekiel Mights well talk about protecting a
battleship

Well Zekiel Forbes returned his mother her eyes bright cant you
imagine a battleship hesitating to run down a little pleasure yacht with
all its flags flying And cant you imagine that hesitation costing the
battleship considerable precious time and money Youve said a good deal
about my sacrificing my room in the house and coming out here to fix a
little home for us both upstairs in the barn chambers but perhaps you
can see now that it isnt all sacrifice that perhaps Im glad of an
excuse to get out of the house where things are so different from what
they used to be and to have a cosy home with my own boy Now then
Zekiel coaxingly these words recalling her boys responsibilities
look over there once more and tell me which of those is the spider

Zekiel dropped the harness and laid his hand gently on his mothers
forehead There isnt anything there dear mother he said soothingly

Zeke she exclaimed jerking away with a short reluctant laugh

Mother dear mother come home with me now he roared
sentimentally so that Essex Maid lifted her beautiful head and looked
out in surprise Remember Fanshaw and put more water in it after
this he added dropping his arm to his mothers neck and capturing her
with a hug

Zekiel she protested Zekiel



CHAPTER II

THE CHICAGO LETTER

The mother was still laughing and struggling in the irresistible
embrace when both became aware that a third person was regarding them in
openmouthed astonishment

Zekiel let me _go_ commanded the scandalized woman and pushed
herself free from her tormentor who forthwith returned rather
sheepishly to his buckles

The young man with trimpointed beard and mirthful eyes who stood
in the driveway had just dismounted from a shining buggy Doubt and
astonishment were apparently holding him dumb

The housekeeper smoothing her disarranged locks and much flushed of
face returned his gaze rising from her chair

I couldnt believe it was you Mrs Forbes declared the newcomer
Fanshaw isnt He looked around vaguely

No he isnt Dr Ballard returned Mrs Forbes shortly He forgot to
rub down Essex Maid one evening when she came in hot and that finished
him with Mr Evringham

The young doctors lips twitched beneath his mustache as he looked at
Zekiel polishing away for dear life

You seem to have some one else heresome friend he remarked
tentatively

Friend echoed the housekeeper with exasperation feeling to see just
how much Zeke had rumpled her immaculate collar We looked like friends
when you came up didnt we

Like intimate friends murmured the doctor still looking curiously at
the big fairhaired fellow who was crimson to his temples

I dont know how long we shall continue friends if he ever grabs me
again like that just after Ive put on a clean collar Hes got beyond
the place where I can correct him I ought to have done it oftener when
I had the chance This is my boy Zekiel Dr Ballard with a proud
glance in the direction of the youth who looked up and nodded then
continued his labors Mr Evringham has engaged him on trial Hes been
with horses a couple of years and I guess hell make out all right

Glad to know you Zekiel returned the doctor Your mother has been
a good friend of mine half my life and Ive often heard her speak of
you Look out for my horse will you I shall be here half an hour or
so

When the doctor had moved off toward the house Mrs Forbes nodded at her
son knowingly

Mights well walk Hector into the barn and uncheck him Zeke she
said Theyll keep him moren a half an hour That young man Zekiel
Forbesthat young mans my _hope_ Mrs Forbes spoke impressively and
shook her forefinger to emphasize her words

What you hoping about him asked Zekiel laying down the harness and
proceeding to lead the gray horse up the incline into the barn

Shouldnt wonder a mite if he was our deliverer went on Mrs Forbes
I saw it in Mrs Evringhams eye that he suited her the first night
that she met him here at dinner I like him firstrate and I dont mean
him any harm but hes one of these young doctors with plenty of money
at his back bound to have a fashionable practice and succeed His face
is in his favor and I guess he knows as much as any of em and he
can afford the luxury of a wife brought up the way Eloise Evringham has
been Thats right Zeke Unfasten the checkrein though the doctor
dont use a mean one I must say I only hope theres a purgatory for
the folks that use too short checkreins on their horses I hope theyll
have to wear em themselves for a thousand years and have to stand
waiting at folks doors frothing at the mouth and the back of their
necks half breaking when the weathers down to zero and up to a hundred
Thats what I hope

Zekiel grinned You want em to try the cold place and the hot one
too do you

Yes I do and to stay in the one that hurts the most The man that uses
a decent checkrein on his horse continued Mrs Forbes dropping into
a philosophizing tone is apt to be as decent to his wife The doctor
would be a great catch for that girl and I _think_ dropping her
voice her motherd be liable to live with em

Youre keeping that dark from the doctor I spose remarked Zekiel

Hm You neednt think I go chattering around that house the way I do
out here Ive got a great talent if I do say it for minding my own
business

Good enough drawled Zekiel I heard tell once of a firm that made a
great fortune just doing that one thing

Dont you be sassy now Ive always waited on Mr Evringham while he
ate his meals and thats the time hed often speak out to me about
things if he felt in the humor so that in all these years t isnt any
wonder if Ive come to feel that his business is mine too

Just so returned Zekiel with a twinkle in his eye

Its been as plain as your nose that the interlopers dont like to have
me there Not that they have anything special against me but theyd
like to have someone younger and stylisher to hand them their plates
Ill never forget one night when theyd been here about a week and I
think Mr Evringham had begun to suspect they were fixturesId felt
it from the firstMrs Evringham said Why father does Mrs Forbes
always wait on your table I had supposed she was temporarily taking the
place of your butler or your waitress

The housekeepers effort to imitate the airy manner she remembered
caused her son to chuckle as he gathered up the shining harness

You should have seen the look Mr Evringham gave her Just as if he
didnt see her at all Yes he answered I hope Mrs Forbes will wait
on my table as long as I have one And I will if I have my health
added the speaker bridling with renewed pleasure at the memory of that
triumphant moment They think Im a machine without any feelings or
opinions and that Ive been wound up to suit Mr Evringham and run
his establishment and that Im no more to be considered than the big
Westminster clock on the stairs Mrs Evringham did try once to get into
my employers rooms and look after his clothes Mrs Forbes shook her
head and tightened her lips at some recollection

She bucked up against the machine did she inquired Zeke

The housekeeper glanced around to see if any one might be approaching

I saw her go in there and I followed her she continued almost in a
whisper She sort of started but spoke up in her cool way I wish to
look over fathers clothes and see if anything needs attention
Thank you Mrs Evringham but everything is in order I said very
respectful Well leave it for me next time Mrs Forbes she says
I shall take care of him while I am here Thank you says I but
he wouldnt want your visit interfered with by that kind of work She
looked at me sort of suspicious and haughty I prefer to do it she
answers trying to look holes in me with her big eyes Then will you
ask him please said I very polite before I give you the keys
because weve got into habits here Ive taken care of Mr Evringhams
clothes for fifteen years She looked kind of set back Is it so
long she asks Well I will see about it But I guess the right time
for seeing about it never came added the housekeeper knowingly

Youre still doing business at the old stand eh rejoined Zeke
Well Im glad you like your job Its my opinion that the governors
harder

Ahem ahem Mrs Forbes cleared her throat with desperate loudness
and tugged at her sons shirt sleeve with an energy which caused him to
wheel

Coming up the sunny driveway was a tall man with short scrupulously
brushed irongray hair and sweeping mustache The lines under his eyes
were heavy his glance was cold His presence was dignified commanding
repellent

The housekeeper and coachman both stood at attention the latter
mechanically pulling down his rolledup sleeves

So youre moving out here Mrs Forbes was the remark with which the
newcomer announced himself

Yes Mr Evringham The man has been here to put in the electric bell
you ordered I shall be as quick to call as if I was still in the house
sir and I thank youZekiel and I both dofor consenting to my making
it homelike for him Perhaps youd come up and see the rooms sir

Not just now Some other time I hope Zekiel is going to prove himself
worth all this trouble

The new coachmans countenance seemed frozen into a stolidity which did
not alter

Im sure hell try replied his mother and Fanshaws livery fits him
to such a turn that it would have been flying in the face of Providence
not to try him Did you give orders to be met at this train sir Mrs
Forbes looked anxiously toward the set face of her heir

NoI came out unexpectedly I have received news that is rather
perplexing

The housekeeper had not studied her employers moods for years without
understanding when she could be of use

I will come to the house right off was her prompt response Its a
pity you didnt know the bell was in sir

No stay where you are I see Dr Ballard is here We might be
interrupted You can go Zekiel

The young fellow needed no second invitation but turned and mounted the
stairway that led to the chambers above

Mr Evringham took from his pocket a bunch of papers and selecting a
letter handed it to Mrs Forbes motioning her to the battered chair
which was still in evidence He seated himself on the stool Zeke had
vacated while his housekeeper opened and read the following letter


CHICAGO April 28 19

DEAR FATHERThe old story of the Prodigal Son has always plenty
of originality for the Prodigal I have returned and thank Heaven
sincerely I do not need to ask you for anything My blessed girl Julia
has supported herself and little Jewel these years while Ive been
feeding on husks I dont see now how I was willing to be so revoltingly
cruel and cowardly as to leave her in the lurch but she has made
friends and they have stood by her and now Ive been back since
September doing all in my power to make up what I can to her and Jewel
as we call little Julia They were treasures to return to such as I
deserved to have lost forever but Julia treats me as if Id been white
to her right all along Ive lately secured a position that I hope to
keep My wife has been dressmaking and this is something in the dry
goods line that I got through her The firm want us to go to Europe
to do some buying They will pay the expenses of both but that leaves
Jewel Ive heard that Lawrences wife and daughter are living with you
I wondered if youd let us bring Jewel as far as New York and drop her
with you for the six weeks that we shall be gone If we had a little
more ahead wed take the child with us She is eight years old and
wouldnt be any trouble but cash is scarce and although we could board
her here with some friend Id like to have her become acquainted with
her grandfather and I thought as Madge and Eloise were with you they
would look after her if Mrs Forbes is no longer there This has all
come about very suddenly and we sail next Wednesday on the Scythia so
Ill be much obliged if you will wire me I shall be glad to shake your
hand again

Your repentant son

HARRY


Mrs Forbes looked up from the letter to find her employers eyes upon
her Her lips were set in a tight line

Well he asked

Id like to ask first sir what you think of it

It strikes me as very cool Harry knows my habits

The housekeeper loosened the reins of her indignation

The idea of your having a child here to clatter up and down the stairs
at the very time you want to take a nap she burst forth Youve had
enough to bear already

A deal of company in the house as it is eh he rejoined It was the
first reference he had ever made to his permanent guests

Its what I was thinking sir

Youre not for it then Mrs Forbes

So far as taking care of the child goes I should do my duty I dont
think Mrs Evringham or her daughter would wish to be bothered but I
know very little about children except that your house is no place for
them to be racing in One young one brings others You would be annoyed
sir Some folks can always ask favors The housekeepers cheeks were
flushed with the strength of her repugnance and her bias relieved Mr
Evringhams indecision

I agree with you he returned rising Tell Zekiel to saddle the
Maid After dinner I will let him take a telegram to the office

He returned to the house without further words and Mrs Forbes called
to her son in a voice that had a wrathful quaver

What you got your back up about inquired Zeke softly after a careful
look to see that his august master had departed

Never you mind Mr Evringham wants you should saddle his horse and
bring her round I want he should see you can do it lively

Aint she a beaut exclaimed Zeke as he led out the mare Shed
ought to be shown she had

Shown Better not expose your ignorance where Mr Evringham can hear
you That mares taken two blue ribbons already

Showed they knew their business returned Zeke imperturbably I
spose the old gent dont care any more for her than he does for his
life

I guess he loves her the best of anything in this world

Love The governor love anything or anybody Thats good remarked
the young fellow while Essex Maid watched his movements about her with
gentle curious eyes

I do believe she misses Fanshaw and notices the difference remarked
Mrs Forbes

Glad to too Aint you my beauty Shes going to be stuck on me
before we get through She dont want any Britishers fooling around
her

Youve certainly made her look fine Zeke I know Mr Evringham will be
pleased She just shines from her pretty little ears to her hoofs Take
her around and then come back I want to talk to you

If I dont come back returned the boy youll know the governors
looked at me a little too hard and Ive been struck so

Dont be any foolisher than you can help returned Mrs Forbes and
hurry

On Zekiels return to the barn he saw that his mothers face was
portentous Lawrence was at least handsome like his father she began
without preamble looking over Zekes shoulder but Harry was as homely
as he was no account I should think that man had enough of his sons
belongings hanging on him already What do you think Zekiel Forbes
Mr Evringhams youngest son Harry has turned up again

I should think it was the old Harry by your tone rejoined Zeke
equably

He and his wife poor as church mice are getting their expenses paid
to Europe on business and they have the nerveyes the cheekto ask
Mr Evringham to let them leave their young one a girl eight years old
with him while theyre gone

I hope its a real courageous youngster remarked Zeke

A child A wild Western dressmakers young one in Mr Evringhams
elegant house

Is the old Harry a dressmaker asked Zeke mildly

No his wife is His Julia Theyve named this girl for her and I
suppose they called her Jule and then twisted it around to Jewel
Jewel

When is she coming asked Zeke seeing that he was expected to say
something

Coming She isnt coming cried his mother irefully Not while Mr
Evringham has his wits They havent a particle of right to ask him
Harry has worried him to distraction already The child would be sure to
torment him

Hed devour her the second day then returned Zeke calmly It would
be soon over



CHAPTER III

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

Dr Ballard had gone and his hostesses were awaiting the summons to
dinner Mrs Evringham regarded her daughter critically as the girl sat
at the piano idly running her fingers over the keys

The listlessness expressed in the fresh face and rounded figure brought
a look of disapproval into the mothers eyes

You must practice that nocturne she said You played it badly just
now and there is no excuse for it Eloise

If you will let me give lessons I will responded the girl promptly
without turning her graceful drooping head

The unexpected reply was startling

What are you talking about asked Mrs Evringham

Oh Im so tired of it all replied the girl wearily

A frown contracted her mothers forehead Tired of what Turn around
here She rose and put her hands on the pretty shoulders and turned her
child until the clear gray eyes met hers Now then tired of what

Eloise smiled slightly and sighed Of playing nocturnes to Dr
Ballard

And he is quite as tired of hearing you I dare say was the retort
It seems to me you always stumble when you play to the doctor and he
adores Chopin

Eloise continued to meet her mothers annoyed gaze her hands fallen in
her lap all the lines of her nutbrown hair her exquisite face and
pliable graceful figure so many silent arguments as they always were
against any ones harboring annoyance toward her

You say he does mother and you have assured him of it so often that
the poor man doesnt dare to say otherwise but really if youd let him
have the latest Weber and Field hit I think he would be so grateful

Learn it then returned Mrs Evringham

Eloise laughed lazily Intrepid little mother Then she added in a
different tone Dont you think there is any danger of our being too
obliging Im not the only girl in town whose mother wishes her to
oblige Dr Ballard May we not overreach ourselves

Eloise Mrs Evringhams halfaffectionate halfremonstrating grasp
fell from her childs shoulders That remark is in very bad taste

The girl shook her head slowly I never can understand why it is any
satisfaction to you to pretend You find comfort in pretending that
Mr Evringham likes to have us here likes us to use his carriages to
receive his friends and all the rest of it Weve been here seven weeks
and three days and that little game of pretending is satisfying you
still You are like the ostrich with its head in the sand

Mrs Evringham drew her lithe figure up Well Eloise I hope there are
limits to this To call your own mother anan ostrich

Dont speak so loud returned the girl rising and patting her
mothers hand Grandfather has returned from his ride I just heard him
come in It is too near dinner time for a scene There is no need of our
pretending to each other is there You have always put me off and put
me off but surely you mean to bring this to an end pretty soon

You could bring it to an end at once if you would returned Mrs
Evringham her voice lowered Dr Ballard has nothing to wait for I
know all about his circumstances There never was such a providence as
fathers having a friend like him ready to our handso suitable so
attractive so rich

Yes responded the girl low and equably it is just five weeks and
two days that you have been throwing me at that mans head

I have done nothing of the kind Eloise Evringham

Yes you have returned the girl without excitement and grandfather
sneering at us all the time under his mustache He knows that there are
other girls and other mothers interested in Dr Ballard more desirable
than we are Oh how easy it is to be more desirable than we are

There isnt one girl in five hundred so pretty as you returned Mrs
Evringham stoutly

I wish my prettiness could persuade you into my way of thinking

What do you mean The glance of the older woman was keen and
suspicious

We would take a cheap little apartment tomorrow said the girl
wistfully

Mrs Evringham gave an ejaculation of impatience And do all our own
work and live like pigs she returned petulantly

Eloise shrugged her shoulders I may flatter myself but I fancy I
should keep it rather clean

You wouldnt mind your hands then Mrs Evringham regarded the hands
worthy to be imitated by a sculptors art and the girl raised them
and inspected the rosetints of their tips Ive read something about
rubber gloves she returned vaguely

Youd better read something else then How do you suppose you would get
on without a carriage asked her mother with exasperation You have
never had so much as a taste of privation in any form Your suggestion
is the acme of foolishness

I think I could do something if you would let me rejoined the girl
as calmly as before I think I could teach music pretty well and keep
house charmingly If I had any false pride when we came out here the
past six weeks have purified me of it Will you let me try mother Im
asking it very seriously

Certainly not hotly There are armies of music teachers now and you
would not have a chance

I think I could dress hair well remarked Eloise glancing at the
reflection in a mirror of her own graceful coiffure

I dare say responded Mrs Evringham with sarcastic heat or Im sure
you could get a position as a waitress The servant problem is growing
worse every year

Id like to be your waitress mother For the first time the girl lost
her perfect poise and the color fluctuated in her cheek She clasped
her hands It would be heaven compared with the feeling the sickening
appalling suspicion that we are becoming akin to the adventuresses we
read of the pretty luxurious women who live by their wits

Silence commanded Mrs Evringham her eyes flashing and her effective
blackclothed figure drawn up

Eloise sighed again I didnt expect to accomplish anything by this
talk she said relapsing into listlessness

What did you expect then Merely to be disagreeable I hope you may be
as successful in worthier undertakings Now listen Some of the plans
you have suggested at various times might be sensible if you were a
plain girl Your beauty is as tangible an asset as money would be but
beauty requires money You must have it Your poor father might have
left it to you but he didnt so you will marry itnot unsuitably
meeting an ominous look in her childs eyes not without love or under
any circumstances to make a martyr of you but according to common
sense and as a certain young man is evidently more and more certain of
himself every time he comesshe paused

You think there is no need for him to grow more certain of me asked
Eloise

You might have saved us the disagreeables of this interview And
one thing more impressively you evidently are not taking into
consideration perhaps you never knew that it was your grandfathers
confidence in a certain course which induced your poor father to take
that last fatal flyer Your grandfather feelsIm sure he feelsthat
much reparation is due us The present conditions are easier for him
than a separate suitable home would be thereforeMrs Evringham waved
her hand It is strange she added that so young a girl should not
repose more trust in her mothers judgment And now that we are on the
subject I wish you would make more effort with your grandfather Dont
be so silent at table and leave all the talking to me A man of his
age likes to have merry young people about Chat create a cheerful
atmosphere He likes to look at you of course but you have been so
quiet and lackadaisical of late it is enough to hurt his feelings as
host

He has never shown any symptoms of anxiety remarked Eloise

Well he is a very selfcontained man

He is indeed poor grandfather I dont know how you will manage
mother when you have to play the game of pretend all alone He is
growing tired of it I can see His courtesy is wearing very thin Im
sorry to make it harder for you by taking away what must have been a
large prop and support but I heard papa say to himself more than once
in those last sad days If I had only taken my fathers advice

Eloise very earnestly you misunderstood you certainly
misunderstood

The girl shook her head wearily No alas I neither misunderstand nor
forget when it would be most convenient to do so

Mrs Evringhams fair brow contracted as she regarded her daughter with
exasperation And you are only nineteen One would think it was you
instead of me to whom the next birthday would bring that detested
forty

The girl looked at her mother whose youthful face and figure betrayed
the source of her own heritage of physical charm

I long ago gave up the hope of ever again being as young as you are
she returned sadly Oh with a rare and piteous burst of feeling
if dear papa could have stayed with us and we could have had a right
somewhere

Mrs Evringham threw her arms about the young creature welcoming the
softened mood You know I took you right to my own people Eloise she
said gently We stayed as long as I thought was right they couldnt
afford to keep us A sound at the door caused her to turn The erect
form of her fatherinlaw had just entered the room

Ah good evening father she said in tones whose sadness was not
altogether feigned even though she secretly rejoiced that Eloise should
for once show such opportune emotion Pardon this little girl She was
just feeling overwhelmed with a pang of homesickness for her father

Indeed returned Mr Evringham Will you walk out Mrs Forbes tells
me that dinner is served

Eloise hastily drawing her handkerchief across her eyes passed the
unbending figure her cheeks stinging His hard voice was in her ears

That she was not his sons child hurt her now as often before in the
past two months but that he should have discovered her weeping at a
moment when he might have been expected to enter was a keen hurt to her
pride and her heart swelled with a suspicion of his unspoken thoughts
She had never been effusive she had never posed He had no right to
suspect her

With her small head carried high and her cheeks glowing she passed
him following her mother who floated on before with much satisfaction
These opportune tears shed by her nonconforming child should make their
stay good for another two months at least

You must have had a beautiful ride father said Mrs Evringham as
they seated themselves at table She spoke in the tone at once assured
and ingratiating which she always adopted toward him I noticed you
took an earlier start than usual

The speaker had never had the insight to discover that her fatherinlaw
was ungrateful for proofs that any of his longfixed solitary habits
were now observed by feminine eyes

I did take a rather longer ride than usual he returned Mrs Forbes
I wish you would speak to the cook about the soup It has been served
cool for the last two days

Mrs Forbes flushed as she stood near his chair in her trim black gown
and white apron

Yes sir she replied the flush and quiet words giving little
indication of the tumult aroused within her by her employers
criticism To fail to please Mr Evringham at his meals was the deepest
mortification life held for her

Im sure it tastes very good said Mrs Evringham amiably although I
like a little more salt than your cook uses

You can reach it I hope remarked the host casting a glance at the
dainty solitaire salt and pepper beside his daughters plate

But dont you like it cooked in she asked sweetly

Not when I want to get it out he answered shortly

How can mother how can mother thought Eloise helplessly

There is decided spring in the air today said Mrs Evringham I
remember of old how charmingly spring comes in the park

You have a good memory returned Mr Evringham dryly

Why do you say that asked the pretty widow lifting large innocent
eyes

It is some years since you accompanied Lawrence in his calls upon me I
believe

Poor father thought Mrs Evringham how unpleasantly blunt he has
grown living here alone

I scarcely realize it she returned suavely My recollection of the
park is always so clear It is surprising isnt it how relatives can
live as near together as we in New York and you out here and see one
another so seldom Life in New York sighing was such a rush for
us Here amid the rustle of the trees it seems to be scarcely the same
world Lawrence often said his only lucid intervals were during the
rides he took with Eloise in Central Park Do you always ride alone
father

Always was the prompt rejoinder while Eloise cast a glance full of
appeal at her mother

The latter continued archly If you could see Eloise on a horse you
would not blame me for trying to screw up my courage as I have been
doing for days past to ask you if she might take a canter on Essex Maid
in the morning sometimes while you are away Fanshaw assured me that
she would be perfectly safe

Mr Evringhams cold eyes stared and then the enormity of the
proposition appeared to move him humorously

Which maid did Fanshaw say would be safe he inquired while Eloise
glowed with mortification

Well if you think Eloise cant ride try her some time exclaimed
the widow gayly It had been a matter of surprise and afterward of
resentment that Mr Evringham could remain deaf to her hints so long
and she had determined to become frank Or else ask Dr Ballard she
went on he has very kindly provided Eloise with a horse several times
but the child likes a solitary ride sometimes as well as you do

The steely look returned to the hosts eyes No one rides the Maid but
myself he returned coldly

I beg you to believe grandfather that I dont wish to ride her said
Eloise her customary languor of manner gone and her voice hard Mother
is more ambitious for me than I am for myself I should be very much
obliged if she would allow me to ask favors when I want them

Mrs Forbess lips were set in a tight line as she filled Mrs
Evringhams glass

That ladys heart was beating a little fast from vexation and also from
the knowledge that a time of reckoning with her child was coming

Oh very well she said airily No wonder you are careful of that
beautiful creature I caught Eloise with her arms around the mares neck
the other day and I couldnt help wishing for a kodak You feed her
with sugar dont you Eloise

I hope not Im sure exclaimed Mr Evringham sternly

Ill not do it again grandfather said the girl her very ears
burning

Mrs Evringham sighed and gave one Parthian shot The poor child does
love horses so she murmured softly

The host scowled and fidgeted in his chair with a brusque gesture to
Mrs Forbes to remove the course

Harry has turned up again he remarked to change the subject

Really returned his daughterinlaw languidly For how long I
wonder

He thinks it is permanent

He is still in Chicago

Yes for a day or two He and his wife sail for Europe immediately

Indeed with a greater show of interest Then curiously Are you
sending them father

Scarcely They are going on business

Oh relapsing into indifference They have a child I believe

Yes a girl I should think perhaps you might have remembered it

I hardly see why if Harry didnta fact he plainly showed by
deserting the poor creature The insolence of the speakers tone was
scarcely veiled Her extreme disapproval of her fatherinlaw sometimes
welled to the surface of her suave manner

Mr Evringhams thoughts had fled to Chicago Harry proposed leaving
the girl here while they are gone he said

Mrs Evringham straightened in her chair and her attention concentrated
With you What assurance How like Harry she exclaimed

The words were precisely those which her host had been saying to
himself but proceeding from her lips they had a strange effect upon
him

You find it so he asked The clearer the proposition became to Mrs
Evringhams consciousness the more she resented it To have the child
in the house not only would menace her ease and comfort but meant
a possibility that the grandfather might take an interest in Harrys
daughter which would disturb Eloises chances

Of course it does I call it simply presumptuous she declared with
emphasis

After all Harry has some rights rejoined Mr Evringham slowly

His wife is a dressmaker went on the other I had it directly from
a Chicago friend Harry has scarcely been with the child since she was
born And to saddle a little stranger like that on you Now Eloise and
_her_ father were inseparable

There was an ominous glitter in Mr Evringhams eyes Eloises father
he returned slowly I did not know that she remembered him

The hurt of his tone and words sank deep into the heart of the girl but
she looked up courageously

Your son was my father in every best sense she said We were
inseparable You must have known it

You appeared to be separable when your father made his visits to
BelAir Park was the rejoinder Pardon me if I knew very little
of what took place in his household A telegraph blank please Mrs
Forbes and tell Zeke to be ready to go to the office

There was a vital tone in the usually dry voice Mrs Evringham looked
apprehensively at her daughter but Eloise gave her no answering glance
her eyes were downcast and her pretense of eating continued while her
pulses beat



CHAPTER IV

FATHER AND SON

When later they were alone the girl looked at her mother her eyes
luminous

You see she began rather breathlessly even you must see he is
beginning to drive us away

I do hope Eloise you are not going to indulge in any heroics over
this affair returned Mrs Evringham who had braced herself to meet an
attack Does the unpleasant creature suppose we would stay with him if
we were not obliged to

If we are obliged to which I dont admit need you demand further
favors than food and shelter How could you speak of Essex Maid How can
you know in your inmost heart as you do that we are eating the bread
of charity and then ask for the apple of his eye exclaimed Eloise
desperately

Go away with your bread and apples responded Mrs Evringham
flippantly I have a real worry now that that wretched little cousin of
yours is coming

She is not my cousin please remember responded the girl bitterly
Mr Evringham reminded us of that tonight

Now dont you begin calling him Mr Evringham protested her mother
You dont want to take any notice of the mans absurdities You will
only make matters worse

No I shall go on saying grandfather for the little while we stay
Otherwise he would know his words were rankling It _will_ be a little
while Oh mother

Mrs Evringham pushed the pleading hand away I cant tell how long it
will be she returned impatiently We are simply helpless until your
fathers affairs are settled I thought I had told you that Eloise
He worshipped you child and no matter what that old curmudgeon says
Lawrence would wish us to remain under his protection until we see our
way clear

Wont you have a business talk with him so we can know what we have to
look forward to The girls voice was unsteady

I will when the right time comes Eloise Cant you trust your mother
Isnt it enough that we have lost our home our carriages all our
comforts and luxuries through this mans bad judgment

You will cling to that despairingly

And have had to come out to this Sleepy Hollow of a place where life
means mere existence and be so poor that the carfare into New York is
actually a consideration Im quite satisfied with our martyrdom as
it is without pinching and grinding as we should have to do to live
elsewhere

Then you dont mean to attempt to escape returned Eloise in alarm

Hush hush Goosie We will escape all in good time if we dont succeed
in taming the bear As it is I have to work single handed dropping
into a tone of reproach You are no help at all You might as well be
a simpering wax dummy out of a shop window I would have been ashamed at
your age if I could not have subjugated any man alive We might have had
him at our feet weeks ago if you had made an effort

No no mother sadly I saw when we first came how effusiveness
impressed him and I tried to behave so as to strike a balancethat
is after I found that we were here on sufferance and not as welcome
guests

Pshaw You cant tell what such a hermit is thinking returned Mrs
Evringham It is the best thing that could happen to him to have us
here Dr Ballard said so only today What is troubling me now is this
child of Harrys I was sure by fathers tone when he first spoke of her
that he would not even consider such an imposition

I think he did feel so returned Eloise her manner quiet again That
was an example of the way you overreach yourself The word presumption
on your lips applied to uncle Harry determined grandfather to let the
child come

You think he really has sent for her then exclaimed Mrs Evringham
You think that is what the telegram meant Im sure of it too Then
after a minutes exasperated thought I believe you are right He is
just contrary enough for that If I had urged him to let the little
barbarian come he couldnt have been induced to do so That wasnt
clever of me The speaker made the admission in a tone which implied
that in general her cleverness was unquestioned Well I hope she will
worry him out of his senses and I dont think there is much doubt of
it It may turn out all for the best Eloise after all and lead him
to appreciate us Mrs Evringham cast a glance at the mirror and patted
her waved hair And yet Im anxious very anxious He might take a
fancy to the girl she added thoughtfully

Im such a poorspirited creature remarked Eloise

What now

I ought to be strong enough to leave you since you will not come to
leave this roof and earn my own living some way any way but Im too
much of a coward

I should hope so returned her mother briefly Youd soon become one
if you werent at starting Girls bred to luxury as you have been must
just contrive to live well somehow They cant stand anything else

Nonsense mother quietly They can They do

Yes in books I know they do

No truth is stranger than fiction They do I have been looking for
that sort of stamina in myself for weeks but I havent found it It is
a cruel wrong to a girl not to teach her to support herself

My dear You were going to college You know you would have gone had it
not been for your poor fathers misfortunes

Eloises eyes filled again at the remembrance of the young gay man who
had been her boon companion since her babyhood and at the memory of
those last sad days when she knew he had agonized over her future even
more than over that of his volatile wife

My dear as Ive told you before a girl as pretty as you are should
know that fortune cannot be unkind nor the sea of life too rough In
each of the near waves of it you can see a mans head swimming toward
you You dont know the trouble I have had already in silencing those
who wished to speak before you were old enough They could any of them
be summoned now with a word Let me see There is Mr DerwentMr
FollansbeeMr Weeks

Hush mother ejaculated the girl in disgust

Exactly I knew you would say they were too old or too bald or too
short or too fat Ive been a girl myself Of course there is Nat
Bonnell and a lot more little waves and ripples like him but they
always _were_ out of the question and now they are ten times more so
That is the reason Eloise the mothers voice became impressive to
the verge of solemnity why I feel that Dr Ballard is almost a
providence

The girls clear eyes were reflective Nat Bonnell is a wave who
wouldnt remember a girl who had slipped out of the swim

Very wise of him returned Mrs Evringham emphatically He
cant afford to Nat isisadecorative creature just as you
aredecorative He must make it pay poor boy

Meanwhile Mrs Forbes had sought her son in the barn He and she had had
their supper in time for her to be ready to wait at dinner

Something doing something doing murmured Zeke as he heard the
impetuosity of her approaching step

That soup _was_ hot she exclaimed defiantly

Somebody scald you ma I can do him up whoever he is said Zeke
catching up a whip and executing a threatening dance around the dimly
lighted barn

His mothers snapping eyes looked beyond him He said it was cold but
it was only because he was distracted What do you suppose those people
are up to now Trying to get Essex Maid for Mamzell to ride

Zeke stopped in his mad career and returned his mothers stare for a
silent moment And not a dungeon on the place probably he exclaimed
at last Just like some folks shiftlessness

They _asked_ it They asked Mr Evringham if that girl couldnt ride
Essex Maid while he was in the city

Zekiel lifted his eyebrows politely Where are their remains to be
interred he inquired with concern

Well not in _this_ family vault you may be sure He gave it to them
tonight for a fact Mrs Forbes smiled triumphantly I didnt know
Eloise remembered her father she mimicked Ill bet that got under
their skin

Dear parent youre excited remarked Zeke

She brought her reminiscent gaze back to rest upon her son Get your
coat quick Zekiel Heres the telegram Take the car that passes the
park gate and stop at the station Thats the nearest place

Ezekiel obediently struggled into the coat hanging conveniently near
What does the telegram sayRun away little girl the ogre isnt
hungry

Not much Shes coming Hes sending for the brat

Poor brat How did it happen

Just some more of my ladys doings answered Mrs Forbes angrily Of
course she had to put in her oar and exasperate Mr Evringham until he
did it to spite her

Cutting off his own nose to spite his face eh asked Zeke taking the
slip of paper

Yes and mine Its going to come heavy on me I could have shaken that
woman with her airs and graces Catch her or Mamzell lifting _their_
hands

Yet they want her do they

No Stupid Thats why shes coming Cant you understand

Blessed if I can returned the boy as he left the barn but I know
one thing I pity the kid



Mr Evringham received a prompt answer to his message His son
appointed as a place of meeting the downtown hotel where he and his
wife purposed spending the night before sailing

Father and son had not met for years and Mr Evringham debated a few
minutes whether to take the gastronomic and social risk of dining with
Harry _en famille_ at the noisy hotel above mentioned or to have dinner
in assured comfort at his clubfinally deciding on the latter course

It was therefore nearly nine oclock before his card was presented to
Mr and Mrs Harry to whom it brought considerable relief of mind and
they hastened down to the dingy parlor with alacrity

You see we thought you might accept our invitation to dinner said
Harry heartily as he grasped his parents passive hand but your
business hours are so short I dare say you have been at home since the
middle of the afternoon As he spoke the hard lines of his fathers
impassive face smote him with a thousand associations many of them
bringing remorse He wondered how much his own conduct had had to do
with graving them so deeply

His wifes observant eyes were scanning this guardian of her child
from the crown of his immaculate head to the toes of his correct patent
leathers His expressionless eyes turned to her This is your wife he
asked again offering the passive hand

Yes father this is Julia responded Harry proudly Im sorry the
time is so short I do want you to know her

The young mans face grew eloquent

That is a pleasure to come responded Mr Evringham mechanically He
turned stiffly and cast a glance about You brought your daughter I
presume

Yes indeed answered Mrs Evringham Harry was so glad to receive
your permission We had made arrangements for her provisionally with
friends in Chicago but we were desirous that she should have this
opportunity to see her fathers home and know you

Mr Evringham thought with regret of those friends in Chicago Many
times in the last two days he had deeply repented allowing himself to be
exasperated into thus committing himself

Do sit down father said Harry as his wife seated herself in the
nearest chair

Mr Evringham hesitated before complying Well he said perfunctorily
you have gone into something that promises well eh Harry

It looks that way Im chiefly occupied these days in being thankful
The young man smiled with an extraordinary sweetness of expression
which transfigured his face and which his father remembered well as
always promising much and performing nothing I might spend a lot of
time crying over spilt milk but Julia says I mustnthe glanced
across at his wife whose dark eyes smiled backand what Julia says
goes I intend to spend a year or two doing instead of talking

It will answer better remarked his father

Yes sir Harrys voice grew still more earnest And by that time
perhaps I can express my regret to you for things done and things left
undone with more convincingness

The older man made a slight gesture of rejection with one wellkept
hand Let bygones be bygones he returned briefly

When I think pursued Harry his impulsive manner in strange contrast
to that of his listener that if I had been behaving myself all this
time I might have seen dear old Lawrence again

Mr Evringham kept silence

How are Madge and Eloise I thought perhaps Madge might come in and
meet us at the train

They are in the best of health thank you EhaI think if youll
call your daughter now we will go Its rather a long ride you know
No express trains at this hour When you return we will have more of a
visit

Harry and his wife exchanged a glance Why Jewel is asleep answered
the young man after a pause She was so sleepy she couldnt hold her
eyes open

You mean youve let her go to bed asked Mr Evringham with a not
very successful attempt to veil his surprise and annoyance

Whyyes We supposed she would see us off you know

Your memory is rather short it strikes me returned his father You
sail at eight AM I believe Did you think I could get in from BelAir
at that hour

No I thought you would naturally remain in the city over night You
used to stay in rather frequently didnt you

Ive not done so for five years but you couldnt know that Is it out
of the question to dress the child again I hope she is too healthy to
be disturbed by a trifle like that

Mrs Evringham cast a startled look at her fatherinlaw It would
disappoint Jewel very much not to see us off she returned

Mr Evringham shrugged his shoulders Let it go then Let it go he
said quickly

Harrys plain face had grown concerned Is Mrs Forbes with you still
he asked

Oh yes I couldnt keep house without Mrs Forbes Well rising if
you young people will excuse me I believe I will go to the club and
turn in

Couldnt you stand it here one night do you think asked Harry
rising The club is rather far uptown for such an early start

No Ill be on hand Im used to rising early for a canter Ill take
it with a cab horse this time That will be all the difference And
with this attempt at jocularity Mr Evringham shook hands once more and
departed swallowing his illhumor as best he could Any instincts of
the family man which might once have reigned in him had long since been
inhibited This episode was a cruel invasion upon his bachelor habits

Left alone Harry and his wife without a word ascended to their room
and with one accord approached the little bed in the corner where their
child lay asleep

The man took his wifes hand Ive done it now Julia he said
dejectedly Its my confounded optimism again

Your optimism is all right she returned smoothing his hand gently
though her heart was beating fast and the vision of her fatherinlaw
with his elegant figure and cold eyes was weighing upon her spirit

Harry looked long on the plain little sleeping face so like his own in
spite of its exquisite childcoloring and bending touched the tossed
straight flaxen hair

We couldnt take her I suppose he asked

No replied the yearning mother quietly We have prayed over it We
must know that all will be right

His bark is worse than his bite said Harry doubtfully It always
was and Mrs Forbes is there

You say she is a kind sort of woman

Why I suppose so uncertainly I never had much to do with her

And your sister Isnt it very strange that she didnt come in to meet
us I was so certain I should put Jewel into her hands I feel a little
bewildered

Youre a trump ejaculated Harry hotly and youve married into a
family where theyre scarce Madge might have met us at the train at
least

Perhaps she is very sad over her loss suggested Julia

In the best of health Father said so Oh well she never was anything
but a big butterfly and Eloise a little one I remember the last time
I saw the child a pretty fairy with her long pink silk stockings She
must have been just about the age of Jewel

The mother stooped over the little bed and the dingy room looked
pleasanter for her smile Jewel hasnt any pink silk stockings she
murmured and kissed the warm rose of the round cheek

The little girl stirred and opened her eyes at first vaguely then with
a start

Is it time for the boat she asked trying to rise

Her father smoothed her hair No time to go to sleep again Were just
going to bed Goodnight Jewel He stooped to kiss her and her arms
met around his neck

It was an April fool wasnt it she murmured sleepily and was
unconscious again

The mother hid her face for a moment on her husbands shoulder Help
me to feel that were doing right she whispered with a catch in her
breath

As if I could help _you_ Julia he returned humbly

Oh yes you can dear She withdrew from his embrace and going to
the dresser took down her hair The smiling face of a doll looked up at
her from the neighboring chair where it was sitting bolt upright Her
costume was fresh from the modiste and her feet though hopelessly
pigeontoed were encased in bronze boots of a freshness which caught
the dim gaslight with a golden sheen

Mrs Evringham smiled through her moist eyes

Well Jewel _was_ sleepy She forgot to undress Anna Belle she said

Letting her hair fall about her like a veil she caught up the doll and
pressed it to her heart impulsively You are going to stay with her
Anna Belle I envy you I envy you she whispered An irrepressible
tear fell on the sumptuous trimming of the little hat Be good to her
comfort her comfort her little dolly Hastily wiping her eyes she
turned to her husband still holding the doll We shall have to be very
careful Harry in the morning If we are harboring one wrong or fearful
thought we must not let Jewel know it

Oh I wish it were over I wish the next month were over he replied
restively



CHAPTER V

BON VOYAGE

At the dock next morning the scene was one of the usual confusion The
sailing time was drawing near and Mr Evringham had not appeared

Harry with his little girls hand in his stood at the foot of the gang
plank peering at every newcomer and growing more anxious every moment
Jewel occupied herself in throwing kisses to her mother who stood at
the rail far above never taking her eyes from the little figure in the
blue sailor suit

The child noted her fathers set lips and the concentrated expression of
his eyes

If grandpa doesnt come what shall I do she asked without anxiety

Youll go to England was the prompt response

Without my trunk returned the child in protest

Her father looked again at the watch he held in his hand The order to
go ashore was sending all visitors down the gang plank By George I
guess youre going too he muttered between his teeth when suddenly
his fathers tall form came striding through the crowd Mr Evringham
was carrying a long pasteboard box and seemed breathless

Horse fell down Devil of a time Roses for your wife

Harry grasped the box touched his fathers hand kissed the child and
strode up the plank amid the frowns of officials

Jewels eager eyes followed him then as he disappeared lifted again
to her mother who smiled and waved her hand to Mr Evringham The
latter raised his hat and took the occasion to wipe his heated brow
He was irritated through and through The morning had been a chapter of
accidents Even the roses which he had ordered the night before had
proved to be the wrong sort

The suspense of the last fifteen minutes had been a distressing wrong
to put upon any man He had now before him the prospect of caring for a
strange child of taking her out of town at an hour when he should have
been coming into it She would probably cry Very well if she did he
determined on the instant to ride out to BelAir in the smoking car
although he detested its odors and uncleanness The whole situation was
enormous What a fool he had been and what an intelligent woman was
Mrs Forbes She had seen from the first the inappropriateness the
impossibility of the whole proposition His attention was attracted to
the fact that the small figure at his side was hopping up and down with
excitement

Theres father theres father she cried as Harry joined his wife
at the rail and they lifted the wealth of roses from the box and waved
them

Weve wronged him Harry exclaimed Julia trying to see the little
face below through her misty eyes How I love him for bringing me these
sweet things It gives me such a different feeling about him

Oh father would as soon forget his breakfast as roses for a woman he
was seeing off returned Harry without enthusiasm while he waved his
hat energetically

The steamer pulled out The faces in the crowd mingled and changed
places

Ive lost them Ive lost them cried Julia Oh where are they
Harry

Over there near the corner I can see father Its all right dear
choking a little Jewel was skipping and laughing a minute ago It will
only be a few weeks but confound it violently next time well take
her

Julia buried her face in the roses on which twinkled a sudden dew and
tried to gather promise from their sweet breath

Jewel strained her eyes to follow the now indistinguishable forms on the
lofty deck and her grandfather looked down at the small figure in the
sailor suit the short thick pigtails of flaxen hair tied with large
bows of ribbon and the doll clasped in one arm At last the child
turned her head and looked up and their eyes met for the first time

Jove she does look like Harry muttered Mr Evringham and even as he
spoke the plain little face was illumined with the smile he knew that
surpassingly sweet smile which promised so much and performed nothing

The child studied him with open innocent curiosity

I cant believe its you she said at last in a voice light and
winning a voice as sweet as the smile

I dont wonder I dont quite know myself this morning he replied
brusquely

We have a picture of you but its a longago one and I thought
by this time you would be old andand bent over you know the way
grandpas are

Even in that place of drays and at eight oclock AM these words fell
not disagreeably upon irritated ears

I think myself Nature did not intend me to be a grandpa he replied

Oh yes youre just the right kind returned the child hastily and
confidently Strong andand handsome

Mr Evringham looked at her in amazement The little rascal he
thought Has she been coached

I suppose we may get away from here now he said aloud Theres
nothing more to wait for

Didnt the roses make mother happy asked the little girl trotting
along beside his long strides I think it was wonderful for you to
bring them so early in the morning

Mr Evringham summoned a cab

Oh are we gong in a carriage cried Jewel highly pleased But I
mustnt forget grandpa theres something father told me I must give
you the first thing Will you take Anna Belle a minute please and Mr
Evringham found himself holding the doll fiercely by one leg while small
hands worked at the catch of a very new little leather sidebag

At last Jewel produced a brass square

Oh your trunk check Mr Evringham exchanged the doll for it with
alacrity Get in He held open the cab door

Jewel obeyed but not without some misgivings when her guardian so
coolly pocketed the check

Yes its for my trunk she replied when her grandfather was beside
her and they began rattling over the stones I have a checked silk
dress she added softly after a pause It were well to let him know
the value of her baggage

Have you indeed How old are you Julia Your name is Julia I
believe

Yes sir my _names_ Julia but so is mothers and they call me
Jewel Im nearly nine grandpa

Hm Time flies was the brief response

Jewel looked out of the cab window in the noisy silence that followed
At last her voice was raised to sound through the clatter I suppose my
trunk is somewhere else she said suggestively

Yes your trunk will reach home all right plaid silk and all

Jewel smiled and lifting the doll she let her look out the window upon
the uninviting prospect Anna Belles clothes are in the trunk too
she added turning and speaking confidentially

Whose asked Mr Evringham startled Theres no one else coming I
suppose

Why this is Anna Belle returned the child laughing and lifting the
bisque beauty so that the full radiance of her smile beamed upon her
companion Thats your greatgrandfather dearie that Ive told you
about she said patronizingly Weve been so _excited_ the last few
days since we knew we were coming looking again at Mr Evringham
Ive told Anna Belle all about beautiful BelAir Park and the big
house and the big trees and the ravine and the brook Isnt it nice
joyfully that it doesnt rain today and we shall see it in the
sunshine

Rain would have made it more disagreeable certainly returned Mr
Evringham congratulating himself that he was escaping that further rain
of tears which he had dreaded It is a good day for your father and
mother to set out on their trip he added

Yes and theyre only to be gone six little weeks returned Jewel
smoothing her dolls boa and Im to have this lovely visit and Im to
write them very often and theyll write to me and we shall all be so
happy Jewel trotted Anna Belle on her shortskirted knee and hummed a
tune which was lost in the rattle of wheels

You can read and write eh

Oh yees replied the child with amused scorn How would I get
my lessons if I couldnt read Of coursebig words she added
conscientiously

Precisely agreed Mr Evringham dryly Big words I dare say

A sudden thought occurring to his companion she looked up again

You pretty nearly didnt come she said and just think if you
hadnt I was going to England Father said so

At the sweet inflections of the childs voice Mr Evringhams brows
contracted with remembrance of his wrongs I should have come Your
father might have known that

I suppose he wouldnt have liked to leave me sitting on the dock alone
but I should have known youd come The funny part is I shouldnt have
known _you_ Jewel laughed I should have kept looking for an old
man with white hair and a cane like Grandpa Morris Hes a grandpa in
Chicago that I know Hes just as kind as he can be but he has the
_queerest_ back He goes to our church but says he came in at the
eleventh hour I think he used to have rheumatism And while I was
sitting there you could have walked right by me

Humph

But then youd have known _me_ went on Jewel straightening Anna
Belles hat so it would have been all right Youd have known there
would be only one little girl waiting there and you would have said
Oh here you are Jewel Ive come Im your grandpa The child
unconsciously mimicked the short brusque speech

Mr Evringham regarded her rather darkly Eh I hope youre not
impudent

Whats that asked Jewel doubtfully

Her companions brow grew darker

Impudent I say

And what is impudent

Dont you know suspiciously

No sir replied the child some anxiety clouding her bright look Is
it error

Mr Evringham regarded her rather blankly Its something you mustnt
be he replied at last

Jewels face cleared Oh no I wont then she replied earnestly You
tell me when Imit because I want to make you happy

Mr Evringham cleared his throat He felt somewhat embarrassed and was
glad they had reached the ferry

Were going on a boat arent we she asked when they had passed
through the gate

Yes and we can make this boat if we hurry Mr Evringham suddenly
felt a little hand slide into his Jewel was skipping along beside him
to keep up with his long strides and he glanced down at the bobbing
flaxen head with its large ribbon bows while the impulse to withdraw
his hand was thwarted by the closer clinging of the small fingers

Father told me about the ferry said Jewel with satisfaction and
youll show me the statue of Liberty wont you grandpa Isnt it a
splendid boat Oh can we go out close to the water

Mr Evringham sighed heavily He did not wish to go out close to the
water He wished to sit down in comfort in the cabin and read the paper
which he had just taken from a newsboy It seemed to him a very long
time since he had done anything he wished to but a little hand was
pulling eagerly at his and mechanically he followed out to where the
brisk spring wind ruffled the river and assaulted his hat He jerked his
hand from Jewels to hold it in place

Isnt this beautiful cried the child joyfully as the boat steamed
on Can you do this every day grandpa

What Oh yes yes

Something in the tone caused the little girl to look up from her view of
the wide water spaces to the grim face above

Is there something that makes you sorry grandpa she asked softly

His eyes were fixed on a ferry boat black with its human freight about
to pass them on its way to the city

I was wishing I were on that boat Thats all

The little girl lifted her shoulders I dont believe theres room
she said looking smilingly for a response from her companion I dont
believe even Anna Belle could squeeze on Do you think so

Mr Evringham holding his hat with one hand was endeavoring to fetter
the lively corners of his newspaper in such shape that he could at least
get a glimpse of headlines

Oh I see a statue Is that it grandpa Is that it

What vaguely Oh yes The statue of Liberty Yes thats it As
if there was any liberty for anybody muttered Mr Evringham into his
mustache

It isnt so very big objected Jewel

Were not so very near it

Just think gayly father and mother are sailing away just the way we
are

Hm returned Mr Evringham trying to read the report of the stock
market and becoming more impatient each instant with the sportive
breeze

Julia he said at last I am going into the cabin to read the paper
Will you go in or do you wish to stay here

May I stay here

Yes doubtfully I suppose so if you wont climb on the rail oror
anything

Jewel laughed in gleeful appreciation of the joke Her grandfather met
her blue eyes unsmilingly and vanished

I wish grandpa didnt look so sorry she thought regretfully He is
a very important man grandpa is and perhaps he has a lot of error to
meet and doesnt know how to meet it

Watching the dancing waves and constantly calling Anna Belles attention
to some point of interest on the water front or a passing craft
she nevertheless pursued a train of thought concerning her important
relative with the result that when the gong sounded for landing and
Mr Evringhams impassive countenance reappeared she met him with
concern

Doesnt it make you sorry to read the morning paper grandpa

Sometimes Depends on the record of the Exchange There was somewhat
less of the irritation of a newsless man in the morning in the speakers
tone

Mother calls the paper the Daily Saddener pursued Jewel again
slipping her hand into her grandfathers as a matter of course as they
moved slowly off the boat Ive been thinking that perhaps youre in a
hurry to get to business grandpa

The child did not quote his words about the ingoing ferry boat lest he
should feel regret at having spoken them

Well theres no use in my being in a hurry this morning he returned

I was going to ask couldnt you show me how to go to BelAir so you
wouldnt have to take so much time

A gleam of hope came into Mr Evringhams cold eyes and he looked down
on his companion doubtfully

We have to go out on the train he said

Yes returned the child but you could put me on it and every time
it stops I would ask somebody if that was BelAir

The prospect this offered was very pleasing to the broker

You wouldnt be afraid eh

Be what asked Jewel looking up at him with a certain reproachful
surprise

You wouldnt eh

Why grandpa

Well I believe it would do well enough since you dont mind Zeke is
going to meet this train Ill tell the conductor to see that you get
off at BelAir and when you do ask for Mr Evringhams coachman
Youll see Zeke a lighthaired man driving a brown horse in a brougham
Hell take you home to his mother Mrs Forbes She is my housekeeper
Now do you think youll understand

It sounds very easy returned Jewel

Mr Evringhams long legs and her short skipping ones lost no time in
boarding the train which they found made up The relieved man saw the
conductor paid the childs fare and settled her on the plush seat

She sat there contentedly swinging her feet

Now I can just catch a boat if I leave you immediately said Mr
Evringham consulting his watch Youve only a little more than five
minutes to wait before the train starts

Then hurry grandpa Im all right

Very well Your fare is paid and the conductor understands You might
ask somebody though BelAir you know Goodby

Hastily he strode down the aisle and left the train Having to pass the
window beside which Jewel sat he glanced up with a half uneasy memory
of how far short of the floor her feet had swung

She was watching for him On her lips was the sweet gay smile andyes
there was no mistakeAnna Belles countenance was beaming through the
glass and she was wafting kisses to Mr Evringham from a stiff and
chubby hand The stockbroker grew warm cleared his throat lifted his
hat and hurried his pace



CHAPTER VI

JEWELS ARRIVAL

When her grandfather had disappeared Jewel placed Anna Belle on
the seat beside her where she toed in in a state of the utmost
complacence

I have my work to do Anna Belle she said and this will be a good
time so dont disturb me till the train starts She put her hand over
her eyes and sat motionless as the people met and jostled in the aisle

Minutes passed and then some one brushed the childs arm in taking
the seat beside her Oh please dont sit on Anna Belle she cried
suddenly and looked up into a pair of clear eyes that were regarding
her with curiosity

They belonged to a man with a brown mustache and dark short pointed
beard who carried a small square black case and had altogether a very
clean fresh agreeable appearance

Do I look like a person who would sit on Anna Belle he asked gravely

The doll was enthroned upon his knee as he set down his case and the
train started

If she annoys you Ill take her said Jewel with a little air of
motherliness not lost upon her companion

Thank you he replied but Im used to children She looks like a
fine healthy little girl keeping his eyes fixed on the dolls rosy
cheeks

Yes indeed Shes very healthy

Not had measles or chicken pox or mumps or any of those things yet
pursued the pleasant voice

Oh dear gasped Jewel Please let me take Anna Belle She caught her
doll into her arms and met her companions surprised gaze

I havent any of them he returned amused Dont be afraid

Im not afraid answered the child promptly There is nothing to be
afraid of

I was only going to say said the young man that if she was ailing I
could prescribe for her I have my case right here

Jewels startled look fell to the black case Whats that Medicine
she asked softly

It certainly is So you see you have a doctor handy if anything ails
the baby

The child gazed at him with grave scrutiny Do you believe in materia
medica she asked

The young doctor threw back his head and laughed heartily Well yes
he answered at last I am supposed to

To his surprise his neighbor returned to the attitude in which he had
found her with one hand over her eyes

He ceased laughing and looked at her in some discomfiture Her mouth was
set seriously There was no quiver of the rosy lips

To his relief in a minute she dropped her hand and began to hum and
arrange her dolls hat

The conductor approached and as the doctor presented his ticket he
said This little girls fare is paid I believe The conductor nodded
and passed on

Im to get off at BelAir said Jewel I hope he doesnt forget

If he does I shant said the doctor for Im going to get off there
myself

The childs eyes brightened Isnt that nice she returned Then she
lifted Anna Belle and whispered something into her ear

No secrets said the doctor

I was just reminding Anna belle how we are always taken care of
returned Jewel

The young man regarded her with increasing interest and curiosity

Dont you wonder how I knew that your fare was paid he asked

How did you

I met Mr Evringham hurrying through the station He said his
granddaughter was on this train and asked me to look out for a little
girl with a doll

Oh returned the child pleased then you know grandpa

Ive known him ever since I was no bigger than you are But even then
added the doctor mentally I hadnt supposed him capable of sending
this baby out from the city alone

Jewel watched the kind eyes attentively So you see he went on all
I had to do was to look for Anna Belle

And you nearly sat on her declared the child

I deny it returned the doctor gravely I deny it You werent
looking For one second I was afraid you were crying

Crying What would I be crying for coming to have a lovely visit at
grandpas

I suppose you are in a hurry to see your aunt and cousin remarked the
doctor

Yes but I dont know them You see explanatorily they arent my
real relations

Indeed

No aunt Madge is my uncles wife and cousin Eloise is her little girl
but not uncle Lawrences

The doctor thought a minute

Really She is a very charming little girl is your cousin Eloise
Arent you going to tell me your name

My name is Jewel

And I am Dr Ballard so now we are properly introduced He smiled
upon her with merry eyes and she responded politely

Im very glad you found us

Arrived at BelAir the doctor picked up his case and Jewel followed him
from the train He looked about expectantly for Mrs Evringham or her
daughter They were not there

The little girls quick eyes discerned a lighthaired driver and a brown
horse coming around a curve of the pretty landscape gardening which
beautified the station At the same moment Dr Ballard recognized the
equipage with relief

Theyve sent for you That is all right he said and Zekiel with
one side glance at the little stranger drew up by the platform

Goodmorning Zeke Here is your passenger He lifted Jewel to her
place beside the driver whose smooth stolid face did not change
expression

Do I wait for Mr Evringham he asked without turning his head in its
stiff collar

No Mr Evringham remained in town

Is there a trunk pursued Zeke immovably

How about your trunk little one asked the doctor

Jewel produced a paper check A man gave grandpa this for it at the
boat place

Ill see to having it sent up then The doctor looked along the
platform It didnt come this trip He took the childs hand in his
I shall see you again before long Goodby

Jewel looked after his retreating figure with some regret Her present
companion seemed carved out of wood His plumcolored livery fitted
without a wrinkle His smooth solemn face appeared incapable of speech

The swift horse trotted through the village street at a great pace and
the visitor enjoyed the novel experience so intensely that she could not
forbear stealing a look up at the drivers face

He caught it Aint afraid are you he asked

She looked doubtful Is it error for the horse to go so fast she
returned

ErrorZekiel regarded the child curiously Well I guess its
considered one o the biggest virtues a horse can have

Then why did you ask me if I was afraid Youre the third person whos
asked me that this morning returned Jewel with wondering inflections
in her soft voice Are New York people afraid of things

Well not sos youd notice it as a rule returned Zeke Im glad if
she aint one o the scared kind he pursued as if to himself

Oh this is splendid declared Jewel relieved by her companions
smile I dont know as Anna Belle ever had such a good ride See the
trees dearie How the leaves are coming out They arent nearly so
far out in Chicago but oh as the horse turned theres a big storm
coming What a black cloud Were just in time

I dont see any cloud said Zeke staring about

Why right there in front of us excitedly pointing at the long
opaque mass against the sky

That Why thats hills Zeke laughed The mountain they call it
here Pretty sickly mountain wed think it was up Berkshire way

Oh its a mountain Anna Belle joyfully were really seeing a
mountain

No you aint remarked Zeke emphatically Not by a large majority
Guess Chicagos some flat aint it

We dont have hills no So now were going to see grandpas park and
the ravine and the brook andand everything

Zeke stole a furtive look at the owner of the joyous voice The
voluminous ribbon bows behind her ears were mostly in evidence as she
bent her face over her doll in congratulation

Left Mr Evringham in town did you he asked

Yes he was busy and in a hurry to get to his office Grandpas such
an important man

Is he asked Zeke

Why yees Didnt you know it

I surmised something of the kind So Dr Ballard looked after you

Yesand I do hope my trunk will come

Jewel looked wistfully at the driver In spite of his stiff and elegant
appearance he had been surprisingly affable I have a checked silk
dress she added modestly

You dont say so ejaculated Zeke wholly won by the smile bent upon
him Well now if that trunk dont show up by noon Ill have to do
something about it



Oh thank you exclaimed the child

They now sped through the gates of the park and by the porters lodge
and began the ascent of a winding road Handsome residences were set
among the fine trees and at sight of each one Jewel looked expectant
and eager

I expect motherll be kind of looking out for us continued Zeke
Poor kid he added mentally

Grandpa said something about your mother

His housekeeper Mrs Forbes

Oh yes of course I know about Mrs Forbes returned Jewel hastily and
politely He told me your name too she added suggestively

Yes Im Zeke And you just remember emphatically that I come when
Im called Will you

Yes replied the child laughing a little Do you know my name

Its Julia isnt it

Yes but if you called me by it perhaps I shouldnt come for Im used
to the name of Jewel

Pretty name all right returned Zeke sententiously Now you can see
your grandpas house The one with the long porch

Jewel jumped up and down a little in the seat and held Anna Belle to get
a good view The brown horse trotted with a will and in a minute more
they had passed up the driveway and paused beneath the _portecochere_

Mrs Forbes threw open the door and stood unsmiling

Where is Mr Evringham she asked addressing her son

Stayed in town

The housekeeper stepped forward and helped down the little girl who had
risen and was looking brightly expectant

How do you do Julia she said Did you come out alone on the cars

No Dr Ballard came with me

Oh that was the way of it Zeke hitch up the brougham The ladies are
going out to lunch

Why didnt they let me know grumbled Zeke Could have hitched up the
brougham just as well in the first place

Dont ask _me_ returned his mother acidly Where is your bag Julia
I hope you havent left it in the train

No I didnt have any I used mothers She knew Id have my trunk
tonight

Then come in and Ill show you where your room is

The child looked eagerly and admiringly from side to side as she
followed Mrs Forbes up two flights of broad shallow stairs and into an
apartment which to her eyes seemed luxurious

Was this ever my fathers room she asked

Why yes I believe it was returned Mrs Forbes to whom that
circumstance had not before occurred

How kind of grandpa to let me have it said Jewel highly pleased

He wasnt in it much your father wasnt Away at school or some other
place mostly Wheres your trunk

Its coming Zeke said hed attend to it Jewel looked up happily I
have ashe was intending to communicate to Mrs Forbes the exciting
detail of her wardrobe when the housekeeper interrupted her

My sons name is Ezekiel she said impressively

Oh returned Jewel abashed He told me Zeke She still stood in the
middle of the large white room Anna Belle in her arms and with the
surprised look in her serious face drew upon herself an unflattering
mental comment

The image of Harry thought Mrs Forbes

Can I see aunt Madge and cousin Eloise asked the child beginning to
feel some awe of the large woman regarding her

Theyre getting ready to go out to lunch They cant be disturbed now
You can sit here or walk around until lunch time Youll know when
that is ready because the gong will sound in the hall Now when you go
downstairs be careful not to touch the tall clock on the landing That
is a very valuable chiming clock and you mustnt open its doors for
fear you would break something Then if you go into the parlor you must
never play on the piano unless you ask somebody for fear Mr Evringham
might be trying to take a nap just at that time then you mustnt go
into the barn without permission for its dangerous where the horses
are and you might get kicked If youre tired from your journey you can
lie down now till lunch time but whenever you do lie down be sure to
turn off this white spread for fear you might soil it Now Im very
busy and I shant see you again till lunch

Mrs Forbes departed and Jewel stood for half a minute motionless
feeling rather dazed by a novel sensation of resentment

As if we were babies she whispered to her doll Shes the most
afraid woman I ever saw and she looks so _sorry_ She isnt our
relation so no matter dearie what she says This is fathers room
and we can think how he used to run around here when he was a little
boy

Tiptoeing to the door Jewel closed it and began to inspect her new
apartment

The sweet smelling soap on the marble stand the silver mountings of the
faucets the large fine towels the empty closet and drawers all looked
inviting Throughout her examination the little girl kept pausing to
listen

Surely aunt Madge and cousin Eloise would look in before they went out
to their engagement Mother had so often said how nice it was that they
were there Surely they didnt know that she had arrived That was it
of course and Mrs Forbes was so sorry and anxious she would probably
forget to tell them

Some altercation was just then going on in the apartments of those
ladies

We ought to speak to her before we go said Mrs Evringham
persuasively Father would probably resent it if we didnt

I have told you already returned Eloise that I do not intend doing
one thing henceforward that grandfather could interpret as being done to
please him

But that is carrying it ridiculously far not to greet your cousin who
has come from a journey and is your guest

My guest returned the girl derisively We are hers more likely I
will not go to her The sooner grandfather sends us away the better

Mrs Evringham looked worried

This is mania Eloise she returned coaxingly Very well I shall go
and speak to the child She shant be able to tell her grandfather of
any rudeness

In a few minutes Jewel sitting by her window Anna Belle in her lap
heard the _froufrou_ of skirts in the hall and with a knock at the
door a lady entered She was arrayed in a thin black gown and wore a
large black hat that was very becoming

Jewels admiration went out to her on the instant and she started up

The lady swept toward her and bending a delicate perfume wafted about
Jewel as she felt a light touch of lips on her cheek

So this is Julia Evringham said the newcomer

And you are aunt Madge returned the child gladly clinging to the
gloved hand which endured for a moment and then firmly disengaged
itself

Your father and mother got off all right I hope went on the airy
voice Im always afraid of winds at this season myself but they may
not have them Your cousin Eloise and I are hurrying away to a luncheon
but we shall see you at dinner Youre very comfortable here Thats
right Goodbye

She swept away and the light again faded from Jewels face as she went
slowly back to her seat

Aunt Madge is afraid too she said to the doll We know there wont
be winds dont we dearie God will take care of father and mother

An uncomfortable lump rose towards the childs throat

Mrs Evringham followed Eloise into the brougham smiling

It couldnt be better she announced with much satisfaction as they
drove away

What

She is plainoh plain as possible Small eyes large mouth
insignificant nose She will never get on with father He never
could endure ugliness in a girl or woman I have heard him say it was
unpardonable If it hadnt been that we were what we are Eloise I
should never have dreamed of doing as I have done Now if only some good
fairy would open your eyes to see which side your bread is buttered on
You could do marvels with such a foil for contrast



CHAPTER VII

THE FIRST EVENING

In the excitement of the early morning start Jewel had eaten little
breakfast but the soft resonance of the Japanese gong when it sounded
in the hall below found her unready for food

However she judged the mellow sound to be her summons and obediently
left her seat by the window As she went down she looked askance at
the tall dark clock which even as she passed chimed the half hour
melodiously Certainly her important grandfather lived in a wonderful
house She paused to hear the last notes of the bells but catching
sight of the figure of Mrs Forbes waiting below she started and moved
on

Thats right Come along said the housekeeper Mr Evringham likes
everybody to be punctual in his house

Oh has grandpa come home inquired Jewel eagerly

No he wont be home for hours yet Come this way

The little girl followed to the diningroom which she thought quite as
wonderful as the clock but her admiration of all she saw was no longer
unmixed Mrs Forbes seemed to cast a shadow

One place was laid at the table one handsome chair was drawn up to it
Jewel longed to call Anna Belles attention to the glittering array on
the sideboard and behind the crystal doors of cabinets but something
withheld her

She looked questioningly at the housekeeper I think Ill draw up
another chair for Anna Belle she said

Mrs Forbes had already decided from small signs of assurance that
this Western child was bold Give her an inch and shell take an ell
she had said to herself I know her sort

Do you mean the doll she returned Put it down anywhere You must
never bring it to the table Mr Evringham wouldnt like it

In silence Jewel seated the doll in the nearest chair against the wall
and as she slid up into her own a neat maid appeared with a puffy and
appetizing omelet

Mrs Forbes filled the childs glass with water and the maid set down
the omelet and departed

Jewels heart sank while Mrs Forbes presented the souffle

Im sorry she began hesitatingly I neverI cantthen she
swallowed hard in her desperate plight Isnt it pretty she said
rather breathlessly

Its very good returned the housekeeper briefly misconstruing the
childs hesitation Shall I help you

Icould I have a drink of milk I dontI dont eat eggs

Dont eat eggs repeated the housekeeper severely Im sorry you
have been allowed to be notional Children should eat what is set before
them Taste of it

II couldnt please Jewels face was averted

Mrs Forbes touched an electric bell The maid reappeared Remove the
omelet Sarah and bring Miss Julia a glass of milk

That was the order but oh the tone of it Jewels heart beat a little
faster as she took some bread and butter and drank the milk Mrs Forbes
standing by a portentous solemn blackrobed figure awful in its
silence

When the child set down the glass empty she started to push back her
chair

Wait said Mrs Forbes laconically She again touched an electric
bell The maid reappeared removed the bread and milk and served a
dainty dessert of preserved peaches cream and cake

Ive really had enough said Jewel politely

Dont you eat peaches and cream or cake either asked Mrs Forbes
accusingly

Yesm returned the child and ate them without further ado

Your trunk has come said Mrs Forbes when at last Jewel slipped down
from the table I will come up and help you unpack it

If only she wouldnt thought the child as she lifted Anna Belle but
the housekeeper preceded her up the stairs breathing rather heavily

Sure enough when they reached the white room there stood the new trunk
that had been packed with so much anticipation The bright black letters
on the side J E had power even now to send a little glow of pride
through its possessor She stole a glance at Mrs Forbes but strange
as it may appear the housekeeper gave no evidence of admiration

I dont need to trouble you Mrs Forbes I can unpack it said the
child

Im up here now and anyway Id better show you where to keep your
things Wheres your key

Jewel laid down the doll and opened her leather sidebag producing the
key tied with a little ribbon

Mrs Forbes unlocked the trunk lifted out the tray and began in a
businesslike manner to dispose of the small belongings that had last
been handled so tenderly

Mrs Harry certainly knows how to pack ran her thoughts and shed
naturally know how to sew These things are as neat as wax and the
childs well fixed In the tray among other things were a number of
dolls clothes some writing materials a box of different colored hair
ribbons and a few books

Glad to see a Bible thought Mrs Forbes Shows Mrs Harry is
respectable She glanced at the three other books One was a copy of
Heidi one was Alice in Wonderland and the third a small black book
with the design of a cross and crown in gilt on the cover Mrs Forbes
looked from this up at the child

Whats this Some kind of a daily book Julia

Iyes I read it every day

Well I hope youll be faithful now your mothers gone Shes taken the
trouble to put it in

Jewels eyes had caught a glimpse of green color Eagerly she reached
down into the trunk and drew out carefully a dress in tiny checks of
green and white

Thats my silk dress she said regarding it fondly

It is very neatly made returned Mrs Forbes repressively It doesnt
matter at all what little girls have on if they are clean and neat It
only matters that they shall be obedient and good

Jewel regarded her with the patience which children exercise toward
the inevitable Id like to fix Anna Belles drawer myself she said
modestly

Very well you may Now here are your shoes and slippers but I dont
find any rubbers

No I never wear rubbers

What Doesnt it rain in Chicago

Oh yes indeed it rains

Then you must get your feet wet I think you better have had rubbers
than a silk dress What was your mother thinking of

Jewel sighed vaguely She wondered how soon Mrs Forbes would go away

This happy event occurred before long and the little girl amused
herself for a while with rearranging somewhat the closet and drawers
Then putting on her hat and taking her doll with her she stole quietly
down the thickly carpeted stairs and opening the heavy hall door went
out upon the piazza It was sheltered from the wind and wicker chairs
were scattered about Jewel looked off curiously amid the trees to where
she knew by her fathers description she should find after a few
minutes ramble the ravine and brook Pretty soon she would wander out
there Just now the sun was warm here and the roomy chairs held out
inviting arms The child climbed into one of them Father would come
back here some happy day and find her The thought brought a smile
and with the smile on her lips her head fell back against a yielding
cushion and in a minute she had fallen asleep Anna Belle toppled
over backward Her plumed hat was pushed rakishly askew but little she
cared Her eyelids had fallen too

Mrs Evringham and Eloise returning late from their luncheon came upon
the little sleeping figure as they walked around the long piazza

There she is exclaimed Mrs Evringham softly putting up her
lorgnette Behold your rival

Eloise regarded the sleeper without curiosity

At least she has not come uninvited was her only comment

But she has come unwelcome my dear returned Mrs Evringham with
relish Just wait until our gracious host realizes what he has let
himself in for Oh theres a good time coming you may be sure Hush
dont waken her It would be a blessed dispensation if she were always
to sleep while her grandfather is absent and Mrs Evringham led the
way into the house her laces fluttering

On the first landing the ladies met Mrs Forbes troubled of
countenance

I am looking for the child Julia she said I cant think where she
can have disappeared

Youve not far to seek returned Mrs Evringham airily She is asleep
on the piazza

Thank you Mrs Forbes hastened downstairs and out of doors Glancing
about she quickly perceived the short legs stretched in a reclining
chair and advanced toward the relaxed little figure

Julia wake up she said touching her

The child stirred and opened her eyes Her movement made the doll slip
to the floor and this caused her to come to herself suddenly

Why I fell asleep didnt I she said drowsily reaching for the
doll

Yes and in Mr Evringhams own chair responded Mrs Forbes

Theyre all his arent they asked the child

Yes but this is his special favorite where he always lies to rest
Remember returned Mrs Forbes Come right upstairs now and change
your dress for dinner He will be coming home in a few minutes

Oh good exclaimed Jewel with satisfaction and passed into the
house Mrs Forbes was following ponderously Oh you dont need to
come with me protested the child earnestly I can do it all myself

Are you sure doubtfully

Oh yees replied the little girl running lightly up the stairs

I ought to put her on the second floor mused Mrs Forbes if Ive
got to be running up and down but I suppose she has done for herself a
great deal I suppose the mother hadnt time to be bothered Id like to
make Mamzell change rooms with her

Jewel hummed a tune as she took off her sailor suit performed her
ablutions and then went to her closet to choose a frock for dinner She
decided on a blue dress with white dots chiefly because she would
not have to change her hair ribbons She had never herself tied those
voluminous bows

At last she was ready and danced toward the door but some novel
timidity made her hesitate and go back sedately to the chair by the
window Mrs Forbess impressive figure seemed to loom up with an order
to her to wait the summons of the gong

She sat there for what seemed a very long time and at last a knock
sounded at the door Perhaps grandpa had come up Jewel flew to open to
himand saw the white capped maid who had appeared at luncheon

They are all at table and Mr Evringham wishes you to come down she
said

But I was waiting for the gong

We only have that at noon

Jewels feet flew down the stairs Her grandfather had sent for her She
was eager to reach him yet when she entered the diningroom her little
face all alight it was not so easy to run to him as she had fancied

He sat stiffly at the foot of the table Opposite him was aunt Madge
and at her left sat the prettiest young lady the child had ever seen

Mrs Forbes stood near Mr Evringham looking very serious

Jewel took in all this at a glance and contenting herself with greeting
her grandfathers lifted eyes with a smile she ran to Mrs Evringham
and turned her back

Theres just one button in the middle aunt Madge that I cant reach
she explained softly

Every eye at the table was regarding the child curiously but she took
no note of any one but her grandfather and her dress buttoned she
ran to her chair and slid up on its smooth morocco Eloise observed the
little girls loving expression

I am sorry you are late Julia said Mr Evringham

Yes so am I grandpa was the prompt response I wanted to be down
here as soon as you came home but I thought I ought to wait for the
gong and then it didnt ring

Her eyes roved to where directly opposite the beautiful young lady was
regarding her soberly

Mrs Evringham spoke That is your cousin Eloise Julia

Eloise inclined her graceful head but made no further recognition of
the childs admiring look

They havent met before said Mr Evringham looking from one to the
other

No returned Mrs Evringham with her most gracious manner It just
happened that Eloise and I were engaged at luncheon today and when we
returned the little girl was taking a nap

By this time Mrs Forbes had brought Jewels soup and she was eating
She looked up brightly at Mr Evringham

Yes grandpa I went to sleep in your big chair on the piazza I didnt
know it was your special chair until Mrs Forbes waked me up

Her grandfather regarded her from under his heavy brows He was
resenting the fact that Eloise had made no effort to welcome the child
Indeed he returned What did she wake you up for

Because it was time to get ready for dinner returned Jewel It
reminded me of the story of Golden Hair when she had gone to sleep on
the bears bed the way Mrs Forbes said This is your grandfathers
chair

She looked around the table expectant of sympathy Only Mrs Evringham
seemed to wish to laugh and she was making heroic efforts not to do so
Lovely Eloise kept her serious eyes downcast

Ha ejaculated Mr Evringham after a lightning glance of suspicion
at his daughterinlaw I think I remember something about that But
Golden Hair tried three beds I believe

Yes she did but you see there wasnt any little bears chair on the
piazza

Very true Very true

Golden Hair was a great beauty I believe suggested Mrs Evringham
looking at the child oddly She had yellow hair like yours

Jewel put up a quick hand to the short tight braid which ended behind
her ear Oh no long lovely floating hair Dont you remember

Its a good while since I read it returned Mrs Evringham laughing
low and glancing at Eloise Her fatherinlaw sent her a look of
displeasure and turned back to Jewel

Dr Ballard found you on the train I suppose

Yes grandpa We had a nice time He is a very kind man The child
glanced across at her cousin again She wished cousin Eloise would lift
her eyes and not look so sorry I wonder she added aloud why Dr
Ballard called cousin Eloise a little girl

No one spoke so Mrs Evringham broke the momentary silence Did he
she asked

Yes he said that my cousin Eloise was a very charming little girl

Jewel wondered why Eloise flushed and looked still sorrier and why aunt
Madge raised her napkin and turned her laugh into a cough Perhaps it
teased young ladies to be called little girls Jewel regretted having
mentioned it

I guess he was just Aprilfooling me she suggested comfortingly and
the insistence of her soft gaze was such that Eloise looked up and met a
smile so irresistible that in spite of herself her expression relaxed

The softened look was a relief to the child Ive heard about you of
course cousin Eloise she said and I couldnt forget because your
name is so nice andand slippery Eloise Evringham Eloise Evringham
It sounds just likelikeoh like sliding down the banisters Dont
you think so

Eloise smiled a little I hadnt thought of it she returned then
relapsed into quiet

Mrs Forbess countenance was stony Children should be seen and not
heard was her doctrine and this dressmakers child had an assurance
beyond belief She seemed to feel no awe whatever in her grandfathers
presence

The housekeeper caught Jewels eye and gave her such a quenching look
that thenceforward the little girl succumbed to the silence which the
others seemed to prefer

After dinner she would have a good visit with grandpa and talk about
when father was a little boy Her hopes were dashed for just as they
were rising from the table a man was announced with whom Mr Evringham
closeted himself in the library

In the drawingroom aunt Madge and cousin Eloise both set themselves at
letterwriting and entirely ignored Jewel The child looked listlessly
at a book with pictures which she found on the table until halfpast
eight when Mrs Forbes came to say it was time for her to go to bed

She rose and stood a moment turning hesitatingly from her aunt to her
cousin

Oh is it bedtime asked aunt Madge looking up from her letter
Goodnight Julia I hope youll sleep well Then she returned to her
writing

Eloise bit her lip as she regarded the little girl with a moments
hesitation but no she had decided on her plan of action Mrs Forbes
was observing her Eloise knew the housekeepers attitude toward them
was defensive if not offensive Goodnight she said briefly and
looked down again

Goodnight returned Jewel quietly and went out

In the hall she hesitated I want to say goodnight to grandpa she
said

Well you cant returned Mrs Forbes decidedly He is talking
business and mustnt be disturbed

She followed the child up the staircase

I could go to bed alone if I only knew where the matches are

You said you could dress alone but you had to ask Mrs Evringham to
button your frock Remember after this that I am the one to ask She and
Miss Eloise dont want to be bothered

Is it a bother to do a kindness asked Jewel in a subdued tone

To some folks it is was the response They had reached the door of
the childs room but some folks can see their duty and do it she
added virtuously

Jewel realized regretfully that her present companion belonged to the
latter class

Now here right inside the door proceeded Mrs Forbes is the
switch Theres electricity all over this house and you dont need
any matches See Mrs Forbes turned the switch and the white room was
flooded with light

A few hours ago this magic would have evoked much enthusiasm Even now
Jewel was pleased to turn the light on and off several times as Mrs
Forbes told her to do

Now Ill see if you can undress yourself said the housekeeper
Jewels deft fingers flew over the buttons in her eagerness to prove her
independence When at last she stood in her little white nightgown so
neat and fine in its small decorations Mrs Forbes said Do you want
me to hear you say your prayers

No I thank you With her hasty response Jewel promptly jumped into
the bed from which the white spread had been removed

I hope you always say them said Mrs Forbes regarding her
undecidedly

Yesm I always do

The child cuddled down under the covers with her face to the wall lest
Mrs Forbes should see a further duty and do it

You ought to say them on your knees continued the housekeeper

Id just as lief replied Jewel but I dont believe God cares

Well returned Mrs Forbes solemnly it is a matter for your own
conscience Julia if your mother didnt train you to it Goodnight

Goodnight came faintly from beneath the bedclothes

Mrs Forbes turned off the light and went out closing the door behind
her

If shed always speak when shes spoken to and be quiet and modest as
she is with me shed be a very wellbehaved child she soliloquized
I could train her I shouldnt wonder at all if her mother should see a
great difference in her when she comes back

The housekeeper went heavily downstairs Jewel pushing off the
bedclothes listened attentively to the retiring steps and when they
could no longer be heard she jumped out of bed nimbly and feeling for
the electric switch turned on the light Her breath was coming rather
unevenly and she ran over the soft carpet to where her doll lay
Catching her up she pressed her to her breast then sitting down in the
big chair she began to undress her crossing one little bare foot over
the other knee to make a lap

Darling Anna Belle did you think Id forgotten you she asked
breathlessly Did you think you werent going to have any one to
kiss you goodnight Its hard not to have any one you love kiss you
goodnight Jewel dashed her hand across her eyes quickly then went
swiftly on with her work You might have known that I was only waiting
until thatthat giantess went away She wouldnt let me bring you down
to dinner dearie but you didnt miss anything Poor grandpa I dont
wonder any longer that he doesnt look happy He has the sorriest people
all around him that you ever saw He lives in a big beautiful castle
but its Castle Discord I named it that at dinner Nobody loves
one another Of course grandpa loves me because Im his own little
grandchild but hes too sorry to show it The beautiful enchanted
maiden and the Error fairy and the giantess are all making discord
around him A little flat is better than a big castle isnt it We know
a flatlets call it Harmony Flat Anna Belle Perhaps if were very
_very_ good well get back there some time Jewel suddenly pressed
the dolls nightdress against her wet eyes Dont dont dearie I
know it does seem a year sincesince the boat this morning If all the
days were as long as this wed be very very old when father and mother
come home The soft voice broke in a sob I dont know what I should
do if you werent a Christian Scientist Anna Belle Well help each
other all we can Now comecome into bed and say your prayers

Say youryour prayer first dearie she whispered sobbing

 Father Mother God
 Loving me
 Guard me when I sleep
 Guide my little feet
 Up to Thee

Now youll feelbetter dearie In a minute you wont be sohomesick
forforfather and mother Hush while I say mine

Jewel repeated the Lords Prayer When she had finished her breath
still caught convulsively so she continued

Dear Father Mother God loving me help me to know that I am close
to Thee Help me to remember that things that are unhappy arent real
things Help me to know that everything is good and harmonious and that
the people in this castle are Thy children even if they do seem to have
eyes like fishes Help me to love one another even the giantess and
please show grandpa how to meet error Please let Dr Ballard come to
see me soon because he has kind eyes and Im sure he doesnt know its
wrong to believe in materia medica Please take more care of father and
mother than anything and say Peace be still if the wind blows the
sea I know dear Father in Heaven that Thou dost not forget anything
but I say it to make me feel better I am Thy little Jewel and Anna
Belle loves Thee too Take us into the everlasting arms of Love while
we go to sleep Amen

Jewel brushed away the tears as she ceased and with her usual quickness
of motion jumped out of bed to get a handkerchief Turning on the
electric light she went to the chair over which hung the dotted dress
She remembered having slipped a clean handkerchief into its pocket
before going to dinner

In reaching for it her fingers encountered a scrap of paper in the
depths of the pocket She drew it forth It was folded She opened it
and found it written over in a clear round hand

Is my little darling loving every one around her People do not always
seem lovely at first but remember that every one is lovable because he
is a thought of God Those who seem unlovely are always unhappy too
in their hearts We must help them and the best way to help is to love
Mother is thinking about her little Jewel and no seas can divide us

A slow smile gladdened the childs tearstained face She read the
message again then turned out the light for the last time and cuddled
down in bed her warm cheek pressing the scrap of paper in her hand her
breath still catching

Mother has spoken to us Anna Belle she whispered clasping the
doll close Wasnt it just like God to let her Then she fell asleep
smiling



CHAPTER VIII

A HAPPY BREAKFAST

Mrs Forbes was on the porch next morning when Mr Evringham returned
from his canter

Fine morning Mrs Forbes he said as he gave Essex Maid into Zekes
hands

Very fine A regular weather breeder Itll most probably rain
tomorrow and what I wanted to speak to you about Mr Evringham is
that the child hasnt any rubbers

Indeed What else does she need

Well nothing that I can see Her things are all good and shes got
enough of them The trouble is she says she has never worn rubbers and
doesnt want to and if she gets sick I shall have to take care of her
so I hope sir youll say that she must have them

Not wear them Of course she must wear them returned Mr Evringham
brusquely Get them today if convenient Mrs Forbes

The housekeeper looked relieved

I hope shes not making you any trouble eh added Mr Evringham

Not any more than she can help I suppose was the grudging reply
Shes a smart child and being an only one shes some notional She
wont eat this and that and doesnt want to wear rubbers but shes
handy and neat and is used to doing for herself her mother hasnt had
time to fuss with her of course and thats lucky for me She seems
very well behaved considering

Jewel had made heroic efforts while Mrs Forbes assisted at her morning
toilet and this was her reward

Well we mustnt have you imposed upon returned Mr Evringham
feeling guilty of the situation The child must obey you implicitly
implicitly

So saying he passed into the house and after making a change in his
toilet entered the diningroom There he was seated deep in his
newspaper and waiting for his coffee when the door opened light feet
ran to him and an arm was thrown around his neck He looked up to meet
a happy smile and before he could realize who had captured him Jewel
pressed a fervent kiss upon his cheek

Oh grandpa how nice and cold your cheek feels Have you been out
doors already

Mr Evringham could feel the said cheek grow hot in surprise at this
onslaught He held himself stiffly and uncomfortably in the encircling
arm

Yes Ive been out on horseback he returned shortly I go every
morning

Jewels eyes sparkled Oh Im so glad Then I can watch you I love to
see anybody ride When I see a beautiful horse something inside me gets
warm Father says I like just the same things he does I must let you
read your paper grandpa but may I say one thing more

Yes

I didnt come last evening to kiss you goodnight because you had
somebody with you in the library and the giantand Mrs Forbes
wouldnt let me but I wanted to You know I wanted to dont you I
felt all sorry inside because I couldnt You know youre the only real
relation I have in the castleHere Mrs Forbess entrance with the
coffee interrupted the confidence and Jewel with a last surreptitious
squeeze of Mr Evringhams neck intended to finish her sentence
eloquently left him and went to her chair

Youre to sit here this morning said Mrs Forbes indicating the
place opposite her employer Mrs Evringham and her daughter dont come
down to breakfast

Jewel looked up eagerly Not ever she asked

Never

The child shot a radiant glance across at her grandfather which he
caught the thread of his business calculations having been hopelessly
broken Oh grandpa were always going to have breakfast alone
together she said joyously Noting Mrs Forbess set countenance she
added apologetically Theyre so pretty cousin Eloise and aunt Madge
I love to look at them but they arent my real relations and her
face gladdening again to think of having breakfast alone with you
grandpa makes me feel as ifas if I had a birthday

Mr Evringham cleared his throat The situation might have been a little
easier if Mrs Forbes had not been present but as it was he had never
felt so embarrassed in his life

Now eat your oatmeal Julia said the housekeeper repressively Mr
Evringham always reads his paper at breakfast

Yes replied the child with docility She poured the cream from a
small silver pitcher with a neatness that won Mrs Forbess approval
and Mr Evringham read over headlines in the paper while he sipped his
coffee without understanding in the least the meaning of the words
Mrs Forbes was right Discipline must be maintained This was the time
during which he wished to read his paper and it was most astonishing to
be so vigorously taken possession of by an utter stranger Now was the
time to repress her if she were to be repressed Mrs Forbes was right
After a while he glanced across at the child She looked very small
and clean and she was ready with a quick smile for him but she put a
little forefinger against her lips jocosely He cleared his throat again
and averted his eyes rumpling the paper as he turned a leaf

Mrs Forbes left the room with the oatmeal dishes

Jewel leaned forward quickly Grandpa she said earnestly if you
would declare every day over and over that no error could come near
your house I think she would go away of her own accord

Mr Evringham stared open paper in hand What Who

Mrs Forbes

Go away Mrs Forbes What are you thinking of I couldnt get on
without Mrs Forbes

Oh Jewel leaned back with the longdrawn exclamation I thought she
was what made you look sorry

No indeed I have enough things to make me sorry but she isnt one of
them

Do you like her wonderingly

IwhyI respect her profoundly

Oh It must be lots easier to respect her prothe way you do than to
like her but with firm lips Ive got to love her I told Anna Belle
so this morning and especially if you want her to stay

Bless my soul Mr Evringham looked in dismay as his _visavis_ You
must be very careful Julia not to offend or trouble her in any way
he said

All right grandpa I will and then will you do me a favor too

I must hear it first

Would you mind calling me Jewel You know it isnt any matter about the
rest because theyre not my real relations but Julia is mothers name
and Jewel is mine and when I love people very much I like them to call
me Jewel

Mrs Forbes here entered with a tray and Mr Evringham merely said
Very well twice over and retreated into his newspaper

On the tray were boiled eggs Jewel glanced quickly up at Mrs Forbess
impassive face She might have remembered Probably she did remember

Life had not taught the child to be shy as has been evidenced so
although Mrs Forbes was an awing experience she felt strong in the
presence of her important grandfather and only kept silence now in
order not to interrupt his reading

When at last he laid down his paper and began to chip an egg Jewel
glanced at those which Mrs Forbes had set before her Her little face
had grown very serious

Grandpa do you think its error for me not to like eggs she asked
Mother never said it was She was willing I should eat something else

Of course eat whatever you like responded Mr Evringham quickly

Mrs Forbes seemed to swell and grow pink You always have eggs sir
and if theres two breakfasts to be got will you kindly tell me what
the other shall be

Mr Evringham glanced up in some surprise at the unfamiliar tone

Oh the oatmeal is a plenty said Jewel looking at the housekeeper
eager to mollify her

Try an egg Perhaps youll like them by this time suggested Mr
Evringham

Do you like everything to eat grandpa

Mr Evringham being most arbitrary and peculiar in his tastes could
only gain time by clearing his throat again and taking a drink of
coffee

Mrs Forbes will bring you a glass of milk I dare say he returned
at last without looking up and the housekeeper turned with ponderous
obedience and left the room

Nimbly Jewel slid down from her chair and running around the table to
her grandfathers place put both her arms around his neck and whispered
to him eagerly and swiftly If you have such a prosomething respect
for Mrs Forbes and it makes her sorry because I wont eat eggs
perhaps I ought to If it offends thy brother to have you eat meat you
mustnt the Bible says so I suppose if it makes Mrs Forbes turn red
and perhaps get the stomach ache to have me not eat eggs I ought to
but grandpa if you decide I must please let me wait till tomorrow
morning so I can say the Scientific Statement of Being all day

Here Mrs Forbes entered with a glass of milk on a little tray She
stood transfixed at the sight that met her

That child hasnt the fear of man before her eyes she ejaculated
mentally then she marched forward and deposited the milk beside Jewels
empty plate while the child ran back and took her seat

Mr Evringham gazing at his visitor in mute astonishment was much
disconcerted to receive a confiding gesture of raised shoulders and
eyebrows which combined with a little smile plainly signified that
they had been caught He took up his newspaper mechanically

He had never had a daughter and caresses had seldom passed between
him and his children His duties as a family man had always been
perfunctory He was tingling now from the surprise of Jewels action
the feeling of the little gingham clad arms about his neck the touch
of the roseleaf skin as she swept his cheek and ear in her emphatic
halfwhisper

His mental processes were stiff when the subject related to things
apart from the stock market his horses and golf but he was finally
understanding that his granddaughter had come to BelAir prepared by
accounts which had cast a glamour over everything and everybody in it
She had evidently found Mrs Forbes fall below her expectations He had
been disillusioned concerning Mrs Evringham and Eloise As yet the halo
with which he himself had been invested was intact Was it to remain
so He still saw how foolish he had been to send for the child He
still wished of course that she was in Chicago now instead of sitting
across there from him in crisp short skirts her head and shoulders only
showing above the high table and a little smile of good understanding
waiting for him each time he looked up

He had done very well during a lifetime without being hugged yet the
innocent incense which had been rising spontaneously before him ever
since the child entered the diningroom had a strangely sweet savor
Such was the joy of breakfast alone with him that it made her feel as if
she had a birthday Perfectly absurd Quite the most absurd thing that
he had ever heard in his life

Mrs Forbes spoke Perhaps it is to be the same way about the rubbers
Mr Evringham she said much flushed Perhaps you will not insist
upon Julia wearing rubbers

Oh yes yes certainly returned Mr Evringham hastily anxious
to reinstate himself I wish you to have a pair of rubbers at once
JuliaJewel You surely dont mean that your mother has allowed you to
wet your feet

II never noticed grandpa but hopefully she lets me wet my
hands so why not my feet

Bless me what ignorance Because the soles of your feet have large
pores through which to catch cold Hasnt any one ever told you that

Jewel smiled That would be a queer arrangement for God to make dont
you think she asked softly Just as if He expected us to walk on our
hands

Mrs Forbess eyes widened and an irrepressible Well escaped from
her lips Has that young one reverence for anything in heaven above or
earth beneath she queried mentally

Mr Evringham managed to recover himself sufficiently to say You
shouldnt speak so Jewel

But you know how it was about the tree of knowledge grandpa replied
the child earnestly God told Adam not to eat of it because then hed
believe in good _and_ evil and that always makes such lots and _lots_
of trouble The Indians dont have to wear rubbers

Drink your milk Jewel returned Mr Evringham uncomfortably not
having the temerity to lift his eyes as high as his housekeepers
countenance No matter about the Indians You are a civilized little
girl and you must wear rubbers while you live with me Mrs Forbes will
very kindly buy them for you

Oh I have money returned Jewel brightly I have three dollars
she added trying not to say it boastfully Fifty cents for every week
father and mother are going to be away

Mr Evringham wiped his mustache You need not spend any of it for the
rubbers he returned You are buying those to please me

I shall love to wear them to please you grandpa she returned
affectionately Ill put them on every time I can think of it

Only when it is wet of course he said When it is rainy

Oh yes she returned when its rainy

Harry looked like my father and she does by Jove mused Mr
Evringham Shes like me Knows what she wants to eat and cares for a
horse if she is a strange little being

You say you like horses he remarked suddenly

I just love them answered Jewel and I came real close to them once
Father took me to the horse show

He did eh

Yes he told mother he was going to blow me to it The child laughed
Fathers the greatest joker he says the funniest things He didnt
blow me to it at all He took me in the cable car and we had more
_fun_ It was the most beeautiful place you ever saw

It was eh

Yes The music was playing and there were coaches and fourinhands
and horns and men in red coats and beautiful little shiny carriagesand
the horses Oh they all looked so proud and glad and they trotted and
ran and jumped over high fences and the harness jingled and the people
cheered The childs cheeks were glowing

Mr Evringham gave an exclamation that was almost a laugh You didnt
sleep much that night Ill wager

No I didnt want to I stayed awake a long time to realize that God
doesnt love one of His children any better than another so of course
some time Ill wear a tall shiny hat and ride over fences just like
flying Ill have a horse Jewel added slowly looking off with a rapt
expression as at a longcherished vision with a white star in his
forehead

Hm Very good taste returned Mr Evringham scarcely knowing what he
was saying so dazed was he by the extraordinary mixture of ideas

After breakfast he had his usual interview with Mrs Forbes concerning
the important event of dinner Jewel had run upstairs to dress Anna
Belle

The menu decided upon Mr Evringham still lingered

Mrs Forbes I have never had any experience with little girls You
have no doubt he said Am I right in thinking that my granddaughter
isis a rather unusual specimen

Shes older than Dicks hatband sir rejoined the housekeeper
promptly

Are they perhaps teaching differently in the schools from what they
used to

Not that I know of Mr Evringham

She uses very unusual expressions I cant make it out You are an
intelligent woman Mrs Forbes Did you ever happen to hear of such a
thing as theaaScientific Statement of Being

Never in my life sir returned the housekeeper virtuously

Extraordinary language that from aa child of her years She seems
to have been peculiarly brought up You heard her reference toin fact
tothe Creator

I did sir At the breakfast table too I was as shocked as you were
sir Her mother put a Bible into her trunk but its plain she never
taught her any reverence The Almighty give her a jumping horse indeed
If youll excuse me Mr Evringham I think you should have said
something right there

The broker pulled his mustache Ive listened to more unreasonable
views of heaven he returned

Do you think it was heaven she was talking about

Mr Evringham shrugged his shoulders You cant prove anything by me
Shes the most extraordinary child I ever listened to

Mrs Forbes pursed her lips Youd not believe sir how differently
she behaves when she is alone with me As mildmannered and quiet as
youd wish to see anywhere She scarcely speaks a word

Mr Evringham bit his lip and nodded It gave him some amusement in
the midst of his perplexity to remember the manner in which he had been
advised to exorcise this tower of strength altogether

Its my opinion sir that children should be made to eat what is set
before them went on Mrs Forbes reverting to her principal grievance

It would save you a lot of trouble if I had been trained that wayeh
Mrs Forbes returned the other with extraordinary lightness

You are a very different thing I should hope exclaimed Mrs Forbes
solemnly

Yes about fifty years different Hard to teach an old dog new tricks
eh You might have some chops for her luncheon perhaps and an extra
one for her breakfast She hasnt eaten anything this morning

For the first time an order from Mr Evringham evoked no reply from
his housekeeper He felt the weight of her disapproval But get the
overshoes by all means as soon as convenient he made haste to add
Ring for Zeke if you please Mrs Forbes I must be off



CHAPTER IX

A SHOPPING EXPEDITION

The housekeeper warned Jewel not to run out of doors that morning as she
wished to accompany her to the shoe store

Im not going to take you Anna Belle Jewel said to her doll I
dont like to ask the giantess if I may and of course it wont be a
very good time anyway so you be patient and well go out together this
afternoon

Mrs Forbess long widows veil a decoration she never had discarded
hung low over her black gown as she stepped deliberately down the stairs
from her barn chamber

I am going with the little girl Zeke to buy her a pair of rubbers
she announced to her son

Going footback Why dont you have out the broom One
granddaughters got as good a right to it as the other hasnt she

I should say so but that child Zeke in addition to her wonderful
boldness this morning with Mr Evringham that I told you about is
perfectly crazy over horses

Hm That dont surprise me A young one that can stand up to the
governor wouldnt be afraid of anything in the way of horseflesh

So I decided continued Mrs Forbes pulling on her roomy black
gloves that it would be better for her to go this morning in the
trolley

You _did_ Well if that aint a regular stepmother act returned
Zeke in protest The kid had a bully time coming home from the depot
yesterday Dick felt good and he just lit out I tell you her eyes
shone

I like to do whats best for folks in the end declared Mrs Forbes
virtuously Julias parents are poor and likely to be Shes only
going to be here six weeks and what is the sense of encouraging a taste
she cant ever indulge No Ill take her in the trolley Its a nice
morning and I shant mind the walk down to the gate The speaker
marched with the dignity which was always inseparable from the veil
toward the back door of the house to give some last orders and Zeke
lounged out with his rake toward the grounds at the front There he
caught sight of a small figure in hat and jacket waiting on the piazza
He turned toward it and Jewel advanced with a smile of recognition
She had had to look twice to identify her fine plumcolored companion of
yesterdays drive with this youth in shirt sleeves and a soft old hat

Well little girl how are you getting on he asked

Pretty well thank you Her beaming expression left no doubt that she
was very glad to see him

Not particularly flattering if she is he mused Fine ladies not out
of their rooms yet and ma doin her duty by her to beat the band

Wheres your doll he asked

I didnt bring her I thought perhaps theMrs Forbes wouldwould
just as lief she didnt come

Ma _hasnt_ played with dolls for quite a spell agreed Zeke with a
smile that was sunshine to the child

You live out in the barn with the horses dont you she asked
eagerly Will you give me permission to go out there some time

Sure Come any time

Mrs Forbes said I must ask permission responded the child with
an apprehensive glance behind her to see if her escort were arriving
Whatwhat is your name

Forgotten this soon I told you Zeke

I thought you did but your mother said it was something very
different

Ezekiel perhaps

Yes thats it I wont forget again How many horses has grandpa

Two here but I guess hes got more in the country You come out to the
barn any time you feel like it Youve heard of a bell cow havent you
Well weve got the belle horse out there She beats all creation

The one I saw yesterday eagerly the one that runs away all the
time

No This is Mr Evringhams riding horse

Jewel hopped and clapped her hands Ill see grandpa ride Goody Ill
watch him

Go to your paths Zeke said a voice and the veil appeared around the
corner of the house

Jewel quietly joined her stately companion and walked away sedately
beside her

They did not exchange many words on their way to the park gates for
Mrs Forbes needed her breath for the rather long promenade and Jewel
was busy looking at the trees and trim swards and crocus beds beside the
winding road

Outside the gate they had to wait but a minute before the car came and
after they had boarded it the little girl was entertained by looking
out of the window and often wished for Anna Belles sympathy in some
novel sight or sound

A ride of fifteen minutes brought them to the shoe store Mrs Forbes
seemed to know the clerk and Jewel was finally fitted to her guardians
satisfaction but scarcely to her own the housekeeper having selected
the species known as storm rubbers and chose them as large as would
stay on

Theyre quite warm arent they said Jewel looking down at her shiny
feet and trying to speak cheerfully

When you wear them you want to be warm was Mrs Forbess rejoinder

I brought my money said the child in a low voice

No Your grandfather wishes to make you a present of these The
housekeepers tone was final and she paid for the overshoes which were
wrapped up and then she led Jewel out of the store

Next door was a candy shop with alluring windows

Id like to go in here said the little girl Would you mind

Do you spend your money for candy Julia

Yesm Dont you like it Jewel lingered looking at the pretty
display Easter had recently passed and there were brighteyed little
yellow chickens that especially took her fancy

It isnt a question of liking it when people are poor returned Mrs
Forbes Im astonished that your mother encourages you to spend money
for candy

Jewel looked up quickly Did you think we were poor she asked with
disconcerting suddenness

Mrs Forbes hesitated Your mother is a dressmaker isnt she

Yes shes just a splendid one Everybody says so We couldnt be poor
you know She found out about God before I was old enough to talk so
you see all her poor time came before I can remember

The housekeeper glanced about her furtively Julia dont you know you
shouldnt use your Creators name on the street she exclaimed when
she had made certain that no one was listening

Why not asked the child

Whywhyit isnt a proper place Some one might hear you

Well wont you let me get some candy now If I knew what kind you
liked Mrs Forbes Id get it

I dont eat candy as a rule Its not only extravagant its very
unhealthy

The little girl smiled How do you suppose your stomach knows what you
put into it she asked I guess youre just a littlebitafraid
arent you

Odder than Dicks hatband quoth Mrs Forbes again mentally I take
horehound drops sometimes she said aloud for a cold

Cant you sneeze a little now asked Jewel amusement twinkling in her
blue eyes I do want so much to go in here

Dont tempt Providence by making fun of sickness Julia or youll
live to regret it returned Mrs Forbes I dont mind getting some
horehound drops but be careful now and dont spend too much A little
girls money always burns in her pocket

Yesm returned the child dutifully skipping up to the door of the
shop and opening it

Mrs Forbes followed slowly and once inside fell into conversation
with the girl of whom she bought the cough candy This gave Jewel
opportunity to buy beside her caramels one of the lovely yellow
chickens which she designed for a special purpose

Now dont you eat that candy before lunch It will take away your
appetite It is nearly lunch time now said Mrs Forbes as they left
the store

And wont you either asked the child offering the open caramel bag
with a spontaneous politeness which somehow made the housekeeper feel at
a disadvantage

No thank you Stop that car Julia and make them wait for me she
said making haste slowly

Once within it took Mrs Forbes a minute or two to get her breath but
she soon noticed that her companions eyes were fixed upon a man seated
a little way from them across the car A smile kept coming to the
childs lips and at last the gentleman himself recognized that he was
an object of interest He looked at the strange little girl kindly Her
hand went unconsciously to the small gold pin she wore The man smiled
and touched one of similar pattern which was fastening his tie In a
minute more his street was reached and as he passed Jewel on his way
out of the car he stooped and gave her ready hand a little pressure

She colored with pleasure and Mrs Forbes swelled with curiosity and
disapproval She knew the man by sight as a highly respectable citizen
What was this wild Western child doing now The car made too much noise
to permit of investigation so she waited until they had left it and
entered the park gates

Julia she said then where did you ever see that gentleman before

I never did replied the child

What do you mean by such bold actions then What will he think of
you

Hell think its all right returned Jewel We have the samethe
same friends

The housekeeper looked at her It was beneath her dignity to ask further
questions at present but some time she meant to renew the subject

Its very wrong for a little girl to take any notice of strangers she
said

Yesm replied Jewel but he wasdifferent

Mrs Forbes maintained silence henceforth until they reached home You
may hang your hat and jacket in the closet under the stairs whenever
you dont wish to go to your room she said when she parted with her
companion at the piazza but dont wander away anywhere before lunch

Nom Thank you for taking me Mrs Forbes

Youre welcome returned that lady and the long black veil swept
majestically toward the barn

Sweet and rippling music was proceeding from the house Jewel tiptoed
across the piazza to a long window from whence she could see the
interior of the drawingroom

It is the enchanted maiden she said to herself and sank down softly
by the window listening eagerly to the melodious strains and smooth
runs which flowed from beneath the slender fingers One piece followed
another in quick succession now gay now grave and the listener
scarcely stirred in her enjoyment

At last suddenly in the midst of a Grieg melody the player ceased
and crossing her arms upon the empty music rack bowed her head upon
them in such an attitude of abandon that Jewels heart leaped in
sympathy

Oh cousin Eloise What makes her so sorry she thought The childs
intuition had been strong to perceive the nature of her aunt Madge It
must be such an awful thing to have your own mother an error fairy That
must be the reason I wish I could tell herJewel jumped to her feet
but just as she was determining to go to her cousin the softtoned gong
pealed its mellow summons and she saw Eloise rise from the piano in
time to meet her mother who at that moment entered the room

Jewel went into the house hung up her hat and jacket and deposited her
packages By the time she reached the diningroom her aunt and cousin
were already seated Mrs Evringham put up her lorgnette as she greeted
the child Eloise nodded a grave goodmorning and Mrs Forbes began to
serve the luncheon

Jewel looked in vain for any trace of excitement or tears on her
cousins lovely face Eloise did not address her or any one Mrs
Evringham did the talking After a question as to how Jewel had spent
the morning and without listening to the childs reply she began to
talk to her daughter of a drive she wished to take that afternoon

Jewel discerned that Mrs Forbes was not kindly disposed toward the
mother and daughter and that they ignored the housekeeper that Eloise
was languid and out of sympathy with her mother and that Mrs Evringham
was impatient with her often to the verge of sharpness The child was
glad when luncheon was over but before going upstairs she brought her
small bag of caramels and offered them to the ladies

Mrs Evringham gave a little laugh of surprise and looked at Eloise who
took one with a sober Thank you

I dont believe I could child said aunt Madge glancing with
amusement at the striped bag Keep them for yourself

Youll have some wont you Mrs Forbes asked Jewel and the
housekeeper so strongly disapproved of Mrs Evringhams manner that she
accepted

Perhaps you would like to try some of our candy Julia said Mrs
Evringham as the child followed her aunt and cousin upstairs

Jewel paused while aunt Madge brought from her room into the hall a
large box beribboned and laced full of a variety of confections

How pretty exclaimed the child

This is from your friend Dr Ballard said her aunt He sent it to
the charming little girl Eloise

Jewel running on up to her room eating the creamy chocolate wondered
still more why her cousin should seem so sorry with so much to make her
happy

Now Anna Belle the time has really come she said happily to her
doll as she took her in her arms and began putting on her jacket and
hat Were going away from Castle Discord to seek our fortunes Were
going to leave the giantess and leave the impolite error fairy and
leave the poor enchanted maiden and go to find the ravine and the
brook Wait till I put on my oldest shoes for we shall have to climb
deep deep down to get near to father

At last she was ready and when she had closed the heavy house door
behind her and had run down the driveway to the park road a delicious
sense of freedom possessed her

There goes the little Westerner observed Mrs Evringham looking from
her window Its a good thing she knows how to amuse herself

A good thing indeed returned Eloise There is no one here to do
anything for her

She has wonderful assurance for such a plain little monkey went on
Mrs Evringham

She has extremely good breeding returned her daughter coming to the
window and following Jewels retreating figure with her eyes and a
charming face when she smiles

Very well Look out for yourself then I thought last night once or
twice at dinner that she was rather entertaining to her grandfather

She has her doll said Eloise wistfully Where can she be going I
wish I were going with her

Mrs Evringham laughed Well you _are_ bored Pshaw my dear Lie
down and get a little beauty sleep Then we will go driving and see
that charming spot Dr Ballard told us about Im sure he will call
tonight



CHAPTER X

THE RAVINE

Outside the wellkept roads of BelAir Park Nature had been encouraged
to work her sweet will The drive wound along the edge of a picturesque
gorge and it was not long before Jewel found the scene of her fathers
favorite stories

The sides of the ravine were studded with tall trees and in its depths
flowed a brook unusually full now from the spring rains

The child lost no time in creeping beneath the slender wire fence at
the roadside and scrambling down the incline The brook whispered and
gurgled wild flowers sprang amid the ferns in the shelter and moisture
The child was enraptured

Oh Anna Belle She exclaimed hugging the doll for pure joy Castle
Discord is far away Theres nobody down here but God

For hours she played happily in the enchanting spot all unconscious
of time Anna Belle lay on a bed of moss while Jewel became acquainted
with her wonderful new playmate the brook The only body of water with
which she had been familiar hitherto was Lake Michigan Now she drew
stones out of the bank and made dams and waterfalls She sailed boats of
chips and watched them shoot the tiny rapids She lay down on the bank
beside Anna Belle and gazed up through the leafy treetops Many times
this programme had been varied when at last equipages began to pass on
the road above She could see twinkling wheels and smart liveries

With a start of recollection she considered that she might have been a
long time in the ravine

I wish somebody would let me bring a watch the next time she said
to her doll as she took her up Havent we had a beautiful afternoon
Anna Belle Lets call it the Ravine of Happiness and well come here
every dayjust every day but perhaps its time for grandpa to be home
dearie so we must go back to the castle She sighed unconsciously as
she began climbing up the steep bank and crept under the wire I hope
we havent stayed very long because the giantess might not like it
she continued uneasily but as she set her feet in the homeward road
every sensation of anxiety fled before an approaching vision She saw
a handsome man in riding dress mounted on a shining horse with arched
neck that lifted its feet daintily as it pranced along the treelined
avenue

Grandpa ejaculated Jewel stepping to the roadside and pausing her
hands clasped beneath her chin and her eyes shining with admiration

Mr Evringham drew rein not displeased by the encounter The child
apparently could not speak She eyed the horse rather than its rider a
fact which the latter observed and enjoyed

Remind you of the horse show he inquired

It _is_ the horse show rejoined the child

This is Essex Maid Jewel said Mr Evringham He patted the mares
shining neck You shall go out to the barn with me some time and visit
her His eyes wandered over the ruffled hair the hat on the back of
the childs head and the wet spots on her dress Run home now he
added I heard Mrs Forbes asking for you as I came out

He rode on and Jewel her face radiant followed him with her eyes In
a minute he turned and she threw rapid kisses after him He raised his
hat and then a curve in the road hid him from view

Jewel sighed rapturously and hurried along the road The giantess had
asked for her Ah what a happy world it would be if there were nothing
at BelAir Park but grandpa his horses and the ravine

Mrs Forbes espied the child in the distance and was at the door when
she came in

After this Julia you must never go away without telling me
whereshe began when her eyes recognized the condition of the gingham
frock and the childs feet Look at how youve drabbled your dress
she ejaculated

Its clean water returned Julia

But your feet Why Julia Evringham they are as wet as sop Where have
you been

Playing by the brook in the ravine

Mrs Forbes groaned Nothing will satisfy a child but finding the place
where they can get the dirtiest and make the most trouble Why didnt
you wear your rubbers you naughty girl

Whywhyit wasnt raining

Raining Those rubbers are to keep your feet dry Havent you got any
sense

Jewel looked a little pale I didnt know I should get wet in the
brook she answered

Well go right upstairs now up the backstairs and take off every one
of those wet things Let me feel your petticoat Yes thats wet too
You undress and get into a hot bath and then you put on your nightgown
and go right to bed

Go to bed echoed the child bewildered

Yes to bed You wont come down to dinner Perhaps that will teach you
to wear your rubbers next time and be more careful

Jewel found the backstairs and ascended them her little heart hot
within her

Shes the impolitest woman in the whole world Anna Belle she
whispered Im going to not cry Mother didnt know what impoliteness
there was at grandpas or she wouldnt have let us come

The childs eyes were bright as she found her room and began undressing
But you mustnt be angry dearie she continued excitedly to her doll
Its the worst error to be angry because it means hating You treat
me Anna Belle and Ill treat you she went on unfastening her
clothes with unsteady hands

With many a pause to work at a refractory elastic or button and many
interruptions from catches in her breath she murmured aloud during the
process of her undressing Dear Father in Heaven I seem to feel sorry
all over and full of error Help me to know that Im not a mortal mind
little girl hating and angry but I am Thy child and the only things I
know are good happy things Error has no power and Love has all power
I love Mrs Forbes and she loves me Thou art here even in this
house and please help me to know that one of Thy children cannot hurt
another Here Jewel slipped into the new wrapper her mother had made
and hurried into the white tiled bathroom near by While she let the
water run into the tub she put her hand into her pocket mechanically in
search of a handkerchief and when she felt the crisp touch of paper she
drew it out eagerly It was covered and she read the words written in
her mothers distinct hand

Love to my Jewel Is she making a steppingstone of every trial and
learning to think less and less about herself and more and more about
other people And does she remember that little girls cannot always
understand the error that grownup people have to meet especially those
who have not Science to help them They must be treated very gently and
I hope my little Jewel will be always kind and patient and make her new
friends glad she is there

The child folded the paper and put it carefully back in her pocket
Then she took her bath and returning to her room undressed her doll in
silence Finally changing her wrapper for her nightdress she climbed
into bed where she lay thinking and looking at the sunlight on the
wall

At dinner time the maid Sarah appeared with a tray Heres your dinner
Miss Julia she said looking at the heavyeyed little girl Its too
bad youre not well

I am well thank you replied Jewel Im sorry you had to carry that
heavy tray up so many stairs

Oh I dont mind that returned the girl goodnaturedly Ill set it
right here by the bed

Is grandpa down there asked Jewel wistfully

Yes Miss Julia Theyre all eating their dinner I hope youll enjoy
yours

Sarah went away and the little girl spread some bread and butter and
ate it slowly

Meanwhile when the family had gathered at the dinner table Mr
Evringham looked up at his housekeeper

Where is Jewel he asked shortly I object to her being unpunctual

Yes sir She is having dinner in her room She was very naughty and
got wet in the brook

Ah indeed Mr Evringham frowned and looked down He had been a
little disappointed that the bright face was not watching to see him
come home from his ride but of course discipline must be maintained
Im sorry to hear this he added

Mrs Evringham and Eloise found him a shade less taciturn than usual
tonight He felt vaguely that he now had an ally of his own flesh and
blood in the house a spirit sufficiently kindred to prefer his society
to theirs and this made him unusually lenient

He meant to go upstairs after dinner and warn Jewel to be more careful
in future to conform to all Mrs Forbess rules but the meal was
scarcely over when a friend called to get him to attend some business
meeting held that evening in the interests of the town and he became
interested in his statements and went away with him

Wasnt father quite agreeable this evening asked Mrs Evringham of
Eloise What did I tell you I could see that he felt relief because
that plain little creature was not in evidence Father always was so
fastidious Of course it is selfish in a way but it is no use to blame
men for caring for beauty They will do it

It was a shame to make that little girl stay upstairs returned
Eloise I judge she managed to amuse herself this afternoon and so she
gets punished for it I should like to go up and sit with her

It would not be worth while returned Mrs Evringham quickly Im
sure Dr Ballard will be here soon You would have to come right down
again

That is not the reason I dont go returned the girl It is because
I am not an Evringham and I have determined not to arrive at friendly
relations with any one of the name When I once escape from here they
will have seen the last of me

The way of escape lies open returned her mother soothingly Im glad
you have on that gown If a man cares for a woman he always loves to
see her in white

As soon as dinner was over Mrs Forbes ascended the stairs to see
her prisoner Jewel was lying quietly in bed the tray apparently
untouched beside her The latter circumstance Mrs Forbes observed at
once

Why havent you eaten your dinner Julia she asked I hope you are
not sulking

Nom I dont believe I am I dont know what that means

You dont know what sulky means suspiciously It is very naughty for
a little girl to refuse to eat her dinner because she is angry at being
punished for her own good

Did you send me to bed because you loved me asked Jewel Her cheeks
were very red but even the disconcerted housekeeper could see that she
was not excited or angry

Everybody loves good little girls returned Mrs Forbes Now eat your
dinner Julia so I can carry down the tray

I did eat the bread It was all I wanted It was very nice

The polite addition made the housekeeper uncertain While she paused
Jewel added I wish I could see grandpa

Hes gone out on business He wont be back until after you are asleep
And if you were thinking of complaining to him Julia I tell you it
wont do any good He will trust everything to me

Do you think I would trouble grandpa returned the child

The housekeeper looked at her in silent perplexity The blue eyes were
direct and innocent but there was a heaviness about them that stirred
Mrs Forbes uncomfortably

You must have got too tired playing this afternoon Julia she said
decisively or you would be hungry for your dinner You took that hot
bath I told you to

Yesm

Where have you put your wet things Oh I see youve spread them out
very nicely but those shoesI shall have to have them cleaned and
polished for you Now go to sleep as quick as you can and have a
long nights rest Im sure the next time you go out you wont be so
careless

Jewels eyes followed the speaker as she bustled about and at last took
up the tray

Will you kiss me goodnight Mrs Forbes asked the child

The surprised housekeeper set down her burden stooped over the bed and
kissed her

There now I see youre sorry she said somewhat touched

Jewel gave her a little smile Nom Ive stopped being sorry she
replied

Shed puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer soliloquized the housekeeper
as she descended the stairs with the tray I suppose her mother is
uneducated and uses queer English As the old ones croak the young ones
learn The child uses words nobody ever heard of and is ignorant of the
commonest ones Im glad shes so fond of me if Ive got to take care of
her



CHAPTER XI

DR BALLARD

Mr Evringham looked about half in apprehension half in anticipation
as he entered the diningroom the following morning Jewel had not
arrived so he settled himself to read his paper Each time there was
a sound he glanced up bracing himself for the approach of light feet
beaming face and an ardent embrace His interest in the news gradually
lessened and his expectancy increased She did not come At last he
began to suspect that the unprecedented had happened and that Mrs
Forbes herself was late

He looked at his watch with suddenly rising amazement It was ten
minutes past the appointed time He began feeling around with his foot
for the electric bell It was an unaccustomed movement for his wishes
were usually anticipated By the time he found it he had become a
seriously injured man and the peal he rang summoned Sarah suddenly

Bring me my coffee at once if you please What is the matter

The maid did not know He was drinking his first cup when the
housekeeper entered the room flushed of countenance

Youll have to excuse me Mr Evringham I couldnt come a minute
sooner Julia is sick

Sick I should like to know why

Why she got sopping wet in that brook yesterday and here just as I
knew it would be shes got a fever

A fever eh repeated Mr Evringham in a startled tone

Yes sir and whats more when I told her you would send for the
doctor it was worse than about the rubbers She talked all the rubbish
you can think of Im sure shes flightysaid she never had a doctor
that she always got well and even cried when I told her that that was
nonsense

Was she ill all night do you think

I dont know I found her trying to get up when I went to her room and
I saw at once that she wasnt able to

Well Mrs Forbes all I can do is to ask your pardon for adding so
much to your cares Let Sarah bring me my eggs and then if you please
telephone for Dr Ballard to come over before his office hour

I will sir but Ill ask you to see the child before you go to town
and make her promise to behave about the doctor Youd have thought I
was asking to let in a roaring lion

Shy probably

Shy That child shy thought Mrs Forbes

She knows Dr Ballard continued the broker and if you had thought
to mention him she wouldnt have made any fuss

If youll excuse me differing with you Mr Evringham I dont think
that childs got a shy bone in her body In the trolley car yesterday
didnt she make up to a perfect stranger She eyed him and fingered that
little gold pin she wears till he smiled and touched one of the same
pattern in his own cravat Young as she is shes some kind of a free
mason or secret society you may be sure I actually saw him take her
hand and give her the grip as he got out of the car Why you know who it
is it was Mr Reeves of Highland Street

Hm You are imaginative Mrs Forbes Mr Reeves is fond of children
and Jewel has a friendly way of looking at people

The housekeeper bridled Well all is I guess youll find I aint
imaginative when you come to talk with her about the doctor was the
firm response When I said medicine she looked as scared as if Id said
poison

Hm Been dosed then Mother an allopath probably Burnt child dreads
the fire I think homeopathy is the thing for children Guy will do very
well Call him up at once please He might go out

When Mr Evringham had finished his breakfast he climbed to the
white room planning as he went a short and peremptory speech to the
rebellious one for he had less time left than usual for his daily talk
with his housekeeper before catching the train

The curtains in the room were half drawn as he entered and the childs
figure looked small in the big white bed She exclaimed as he drew near
and seizing his hand kissed it

Youd better not kiss me grandpa because Im so hot and
uncomfortable she said thickly Oh how I wanted to see you all
night

The little hands clinging to his were burning He sat down on the edge
of the bed

Im very sorry for this Jewel Its your own fault I understand my
girl

Yes I know it is When I first called the house Castle Discord and
talked to Anna Belle about the error fairy and the enchanted maiden
and the giantess I didnt see it was hate creeping in and making me not
careful to deny it all I know it is all my fault

Mr Evringham gazed at the flushed face with startled eyes Dear
me this is really very bad he thought Delirious so early in the
morning I wish Guy would come

Well well soon have Dr Ballard here he said aloud trying to speak
soothingly Hell set you all right very soon

Oh grandpa dear grandpa with the utmost earnestness would you
please not send for the doctor I wont be any trouble I dont want
anything to eat only a drink of water and Ill soon be well

Her beseeching tone and her helplessness touched some unsuspected chord
in her listeners breast

Jewel dont you want to go out to the stable with me and feed Essex
Maid with sugar he asked

Yes grandpa with a half sob

You dont want me to be unhappy and worried about you when I get into
my office

No grandpa

And you liked Dr Ballard Im sure when you came out with him on the
train day before yesterday

Day before yesterday Oh _was_ it It seems a year ago But I wanted
to come and see you so much I was willing to let father and mother go
away and I never thought that I wouldnt know when error was getting
hold of me

Well never mind now Jewel Dr Ballard will help you and as soon as
you get well Ill take you for a fine long drive if youll be good Im
sure you dont want to trouble me

No Another half sob caught the childs throat Here is something
I bought for you yesterday grandpa She drew from under the further
pillow the yellow chicken somewhat disheveled and put it in his hand
I meant to give it to you last night but Mrs Forbes kept me upstairs
because she thought she ought to make me sorry and so I couldnt

The stockbroker cleared his throat as he regarded his new possession
It was kind of you Jewel he returned I shall stand it on my desk
Nowahemlooking around the big empty room you wont be lonely I
hope until the doctor comes

No Id like to be alone I have so much work to do

Dear me dear me thought Mr Evringham this is very distressing
She seems to have lucid intervals and then so quickly gets flighty
again

Besides I like to think of the Ravine of Happiness continued the
child and the brook Supposing I could lay my cheek down in the
brook now The water is so cool and it laughs and whispers such pretty
things

Now if you would try to go to sleep Jewel said Mr Evringham
it would please me very much Goodby I shall come to see you again
tonight He stooped his tall form and kissed the childs forehead and
her hot lips pressed his hand then he went out

At the foot of the stairs he encountered Mrs Forbes waiting and
hastily put behind him the hand that held the chicken

Well sir

Shes very badly off very badly off Im afraid

I hope not sir Children are always flighty if they have a little
fever What about dinner sir

Have anything you please returned Mr Evringham briefly I wish to
see Dr Ballard as soon as he arrives Tell Zeke I shall not go until
the next train With these words the broker entered his study and his
housekeeper looked after him in amazement It was the first time she had
ever seen him indifferent concerning his dinner

I wonder if he thinks shes got something catching she soliloquized
Then a sudden thought occurred to her No great loss without some small
gain she thought grimly T would clear the house

She watched at the window until she saw Dr Ballards buggy approaching
Then she opened the door and met him

Your little visitor do you say asked the young doctor as he greeted
her and entered What mischief has she been up to so soon

Oh the usual sort returned Mrs Forbes and recounted her
grievances Shes the oddest child in the world she finished and
her last freak is that she doesnt want to have a doctor

Dear me what heresy The young man smiled Which room Mrs Forbes

Please go into the library first Dr Ballard Mr Evringham is waiting
to see you

The broker was sitting before his desk as the doctor entered and he
turned with a brief greeting

Im glad youve come Ballard Im very much troubled about the
child Her father and mother abroad you understand and I feel the
responsibility She seems very flighty quite wild in her talk at
moments I wished to warn you that one of her feverish ideas is that she
doesnt want a doctor You will have to use some tact

The physicians face lost its careless smile Delirious you say

Yes go right up Guy Ill wait for you here Its so sudden She was
quite well to all appearances yesterday

Children are sensitive little mortals remarked Dr Ballard and then
Mrs Forbes ushered him up to the white room He asked her to remain
within call and entered alone

The childs eyes were open as he approached the bed the black case
she remembered in his hand By her expression he saw that her mind was
clear

Well well Jewel this isnt the way I meant you to receive me the
first time I called he said pleasantly drawing up a chair beside the
bed The child put out her hand to his offered one and tried to smile
As he held the hand he felt her pulse This isnt the way to behave
when you go visiting he added

I know it isnt returned Jewel contritely

The next time you go wading in the brook take off your shoes and
stockings little one and I think you would better wait until later
in the season anyway Youve made quick work of this business As
he talked the doctor took his little thermometer out of its case Now
then let me slip this under your tongue

What is it asked Jewel shrinking

What Havent you ever had your temperature tried Well you have been
a healthy little girl All the better Just take it under your tongue
and dont speak for a minute please

Please dont ask me to I cant

Theres nothing to be afraid of It wont hurt you The doctor smiled

I know what that is now said Jewell regarding the little tube A
man was cured of paralysis once by having a thing like that stuck in his
mouth He thought it was meant to cure him I havent paralysis

The doctor began to consider that perhaps Mr Evringham had not
exaggerated Come Jewel he said kindly I thought we were such good
friends You are wasting my time

A moment more of hesitation and then the child suddenly opened her
mouth and accepted the thermometer She kept her eyes closed during
the process of waiting and at last Dr Ballard took out the little
instrument and examined it

Let me see your tongue

The child stared in surprise

Put out your tongue Jewel he repeated kindly

But that is impolite she protested

He changed his position The poor little thing was flighty and no
wonder with such a temperature He took her hand again Ill overlook
the impoliteness Run out your tongue now Far as you can dear

The child obeyed

Presently she said I feel very uncomfortable Dr Ballard I dont
feel a bit like visiting so if you wouldnt _mind_ going away until I
feel better You interrupted me when you came in I have lots of work
to do yet When I get well Id just love to see you Id rather see you
than almost anybody in BelAir

Yes yes dear Ill go away very soon Where does your throat feel
sore Put your finger on the place

Jewel looked up with all the rebuke she could convey You ought not to
ask me that she returned

Dr Ballard rose and went to the door Get me a glass of water please
Mrs Forbes

Not a glass I want a whole pitcher full right side of me said Jewel

Yes a pitcher full also if you please Mrs Forbes Just let the maid
bring them up

The doctor returned to the bedside Now well soon forget that you wet
those little feet he said

That didnt do me any harm that clean sweet brook Mrs Forbes didnt
know what was the real matter

What was it then

My own fault said Jewel speaking with feverish quickness and
squeezing the doctors hand When I came here I found that nobody loved
one another and everybody was afraid and sorry and instead of denying
it and helping them I began voicing error and calling them names
I didnt keep remembering that God was here and I called it Castle
Discord and called Mrs Forbes the giantess and aunt Madge the error
fairy and cousin Eloise the enchanted maiden and of course how could I
help getting sick

Dr Ballard leaned toward her Was this an impromptu tale or was it a
fact that this child had been coldly treated and unhappy You have a
sensitive conscience Jewel he returned

Here Sarah entered set down the tray with pitcher glasses and spoon
and departed The doctor loosed the little hand he had been holding
took up his case and opened it

Jewel watched him with apprehension Thatsmedicine isnt it she
asked with bated breath

Yes The doctor carefully selected a bottle of liquid and set it on
the table I think this one will do us

Jewels remark on the train about materia medica recurred to him and he
smiled

Dr Ballard arent you a Christian she asked suddenly

He glanced up I hope so

Then youll forgive me if I wont take medicine I put out my tongue
and I sucked the little glass thing because I didnt want to trouble
you but I have too much faith in God to take medicine The child
looked at the doctor appealingly

He began to see light and in his surprise for a moment he did not
reply

Jesus Christ would have used drugs if they had been right she added

But He isnt here now returned the astonished young man

Why Dr Ballard in gentle reproach Christ is the Truth of God
Isnt He here now healing us and helping us just the same as ever
Didnt He say He would be You will see how much better I shall be
tonight

Dr Ballard met the heavy eyes with his own kind clear ones I see you
have been taught in new ways Jewel he said seriously but you are
only a little girl and while you are in your grandfathers house you
ought to do as he wishes He wishes you to let me prescribe for you No
one who is ill can help making trouble You have no right not to try to
get well in the way Mr Evringham and Mrs Forbes wish you to

Jewel felt herself in a desperate position The corners of her lips
twitched down Dr Ballard thought he saw his advantage and leaned his
fine head toward her She impulsively threw her arms around his neck

You dont want to hurt my feelings Jewel he said She was crying
softly

Noit would make meverysorry but it would beworseto
hurtGods Please dont make me please please dont make me Dr
Ballard

She was increasingly excited and he feared the effect

Very well then Jewel he returned I dont want to do you more harm
than good

Oh thank you she exclaimed fervently through her tears

But Mrs Forbes must think you have the medicine You havent told her
that you areahema Christian Scientist I suppose that is what you
call yourself

Yes sir A Christian Scientist Oh youre the kindest man pursued
the relieved child I realized in my prayer that you didnt know it was
wrong to believe in material medica for you reflect love all the time

While she was talking and wiping her eyes the doctor took the pitcher
and one of the glasses to the window and stood with his back to her

Now then he said returning well put this half glass of water on
the table I put the spoon across it so and when Mrs Forbes is next in
the room you take a couple of spoonfuls and that will satisfy her You
may tell her that I wanted you only to take it about four times during
the day If you are better when I come back this evening I will not
insist upon your taking any pellets on your tongue Here is the other
glass for you to drink from

With a few more kind words Dr Ballard took his departure and going
downstairs met Mrs Forbes The little girl has a heavy feverish cold
She understands how to take her medicine She will probably sleep a good
deal Let her be quiet

He went on to the study where Mr Evringham was waiting sitting at the
desk his head on his hand frowning at the yellow chicken He looked up
expectantly as the doctor entered

Well he asked

Dr Ballard came forward and seated himself in a neighboring chair

Do you know what you have upstairs there he asked in a low tone

For heavens sake Guy dont tell me its something serioussomething
infectious Mr Evringham turned pale

The doctors sudden smile was reassuring It does seem to be infectious
to some degree he returned but I dont believe youll catch it

What are you grinning at boy asked the broker sharply

Dont be alarmed Mr Evringham but the fact is that you have in your
house a small and young but perfectly formed and welldeveloped specimen
of a Christian Scientist

What man The broker grew red again

Dr Ballard nodded deliberately Your little granddaughter belongs to
the new cult and I can assure you she is dyed in the wool and moreover
is all wool and a yard wide

The devil you say ejaculated Mr Evringham But he added with
a sudden thought that may be a part of the poor childs feverish
nonsense She was full of talk of castles and giantesses and fairies and
what not when I was up there

Yes She is no flightier than you are this minute All these titles are
those she has given to your house and household in the last two days
and according to her diagnosis it is that indulgence from which she
is suffering now and not from too much brook She says she has voiced
error

The doctor looked quizzically at his friend who returned his gaze
nonplussed

Thats iterror rejoined Mr Evringham thats what she is
often saying This explains her vocabulary in all probability She
has sometimes the strangest talk you ever listened to Well thats the
mothers doing of course and not the childs fault I maintain it is
not the childs fault With it all Ballard I tell you shes a very
well meaning childa rather winning child in fact Good natured
disposition I hope shes not very ill I do indeed Ha That then is
why she was so excited at the thought of having a doctor Tomfoolery

Yes that was it Weve had some argument The young doctor smiled
She doesnt consider me hopeless however She told me that she had
mentioned to the Lord that she was sure I didnt know it was wrong to
believe in materia medica

No one for years had heard Mr Evringham laugh as he laughed at this
The doctor joined him

Im not surprised said the broker at last If there is anything she
does not mention to her Creator I have yet to learn what it is How did
you get around her Ballard

Oh I used a little justifiable hocuspocus about the medicine Thats
all

And you think its not anything very serious then

I think not Where theres so much temperature it is a little hard to
tell at first with a child This evening I shall make a more thorough
examination The ice is broken now and it will be easier She will be
less excited I see glancing at the yellow chicken whose beady eyes
appeared to be following the conversation the little girl has found
her way even into this sanctum

Mr Evringham cleared his throat as he followed the doctors glance
No he responded shortly She has not found her way in here yet That
ismy chicken She bought it for me

Dr Ballard lifted his eyebrows and smiled as he arose

Come back before dinner if possible Ballard I shall be uneasy



CHAPTER XII

THE TELEGRAM

Mrs Forbes entered Jewels room after speaking with the doctor The
little girl looked at her eagerly A plan had formed in her mind which
depended for its success largely on the housekeepers complaisance and
she wished to propitiate her

I want to fix it so you can call me when you need anything Julia she
said The doctor has told you about taking the medicine and here is a
little clock Im going to put on your table right by the bed and Ive
brought up a bell I shall leave the farther door open so the sound of
this bell will go right down the backstairs and one of us will come up
whenever you ring Dr Ballard says its best for you to be quiet

Yesm replied Jewel Do you think Mrs Forbeswould it be too much
troublewould he have timecould I see Jeremiah just a few minutes

See who

Jeremiahthe gentleman who lives with the horses

Do you mean my son Ezekiel

Oh yesm Ezekiel I knew it was a prophet He always speaks very
kindly to me and I like him I wish I could see him just a few
minutes

Mrs Forbes was very much astonished and somewhat flattered Its
wonderful the fancy that child has taken to me and mine she thought

Well folks must be humored when theyre sick she replied Let me
see looking at the little clock yes Mr Evringhams missed the
second train Therell be five or ten minutes yet and Zekiels got to
wait anyway I guess he can come up and see you

Oh thank you Mrs Forbes returned Jewel

The housekeeper made her way out to the barn where her son in his
livery was waiting and reading the paper

The doctors gone Zeke and the child wants to see you

Me returned the coachman in surprise Why the bully little kid

Yes come and be quick There wont be much time You watch the clock
thats side of her bed and dont you be late

Zekiel followed with alacrity His mother starting him up the
backstairs gave him directions how to go and remained below

Jewel her eyes fixed on the open back door of her room felt a leap
of the heart as Zeke fine in his handsome livery came blushing and
tiptoeing into the room

Im so glad Im so glad she exclaimed in her soft thick voice
Shut the door please

I told you to remember youd only got to say Zeke and Id come he
said approaching the bed Im awful sorry youre sick little kid

Did you ever hear of Christian Science Zeke she asked hurriedly

Yes I did Woman I knew in Boston cured of half a dozen things She
held that Christian Science did it

Oh good good Im a Christian Scientist and nobody here is and I
want to send a telegram to Chicago to a lady to treat me Nobody would
do it for me but you _Will_ you

It would have taken a hard heart to resist the appeal and Zekes was
soft

Of course I will he answered Going right to the station now to take
Mr Evringham I can send it as well as not

Get some paper Zeke in the top bureau drawer Theres a pencil on the
bureau

He obeyed and she gave him an address which he wrote down Now this
Please treat me for fever and sore throat Jewel

Zeke wrote the message and tucked it into a pocket

Now please get my leather bag in the drawer said the child and take
out money enough

The young fellow hesitated If you havent got plenty of moneyhe
began

I have Youll see Oh Zeke youve made me so happy

The coachmans clumsy hands fumbled with the clasp of the little bag

I can do it said Jewel and he brought it to her and watched her
while she took out the money and gave it to him He took a coin
returned the rest to the bag and snapped it

Say little girl he said uneasily you look to me like a doctord do
you a whole lot o good

Jewel gazed at him in patient wonder

Who made the doctor she asked

Zeke stood on one foot and then on the other

God did and you know it Zeke Hes the one to go to in trouble

But youre going to that Chicago woman objected Zeke

Yes because shell go to God for me Im being held down by something
that pretends to have power and though I know its an old cheat I
havent understanding enough to get rid of it as quickly as she will
You see I wouldnt have been taken sick if I hadnt believed in a lie
instead of denying it We have to watch our thoughts every minute and I
tell you Zeke sometimes it seems real hard work

Should say so returned Zekiel The less you think the better I
should suppose if thats the case Ive got to be going now

And youll send the telegram _surely_ and you wont speak of it to any
one

Mums the word and Ill send it if its the last act but dont put
all your eggs in one basket little kid I know Dr Ballards been here
and now you do everything he said like a good girl and between the two
of em they ought to fix you up Id pin more faith to a doctor in the
hand than to one in the bush a thousand miles away if t was _me_

Jewel smiled on him from heavy eyes Did you ever hear of Gods needing
any help she asked Ill never forget your being so kind to me
never Zeke and when error melts away Im coming out to the stable with
grandpa He said I should Goodby

As soon as the plumcolored livery had disappeared Jewel drew herself
up took the water pitcher between her hot little hands and drank long
and deeply Then with a sigh of satisfaction she turned over in bed and
drew Anna Belle close to her

Just see dearie she murmured how we are always taken care of

Mrs Evringham saw Dr Ballards buggy drive away and lost no time in
discovering who had needed his services

Its the child she announced returning to Eloises room

Poor little thing returned the girl rising

Where are you going Stay right where you are She has a high fever
and theyre not sure yet what it may be Mrs Forbes is doing everything
that is necessary Father has waited over two trains He hasnt gone to
the city yet

At the mention of Mr Evringham Eloise sank back in her chair

Dr Ballard is coming again toward evening continued Mrs Evringham
and I shall talk with him and find out just the conditions Mrs
Forbes is very unsatisfactory but I can see that she thinks it may be
something infectious

Eloise lifted a suddenly hopeful face Then you would wish to leave at
once she said

Not at all Father would surely hear to reason and send the child to
the hospital They are models of comfort in these days and it is the
only proper place for people to be ill I shall speak to Dr Ballard
about it tonight

As soon as Eloise had seen her grandfather drive to the station she
eluded her mother and gathering her white negligee about her went
softly up to Jewels room and stood at the closed door All was still
She opened the door stealthily With all her care it creaked a little
Still no sound from within She looked toward the bed saw the flushed
face of the child and that she was asleep so she withdrew as quietly

During the day she inquired of Mrs Forbes if she could be of any
service but the housekeeper received the suggestion with curt respect
assuring her that Dr Ballard had said Jewel would sleep a good deal
and should not be disturbed

Mrs Evringham overheard the question and welcomed the reply with
relief

Jewel ate the bread and fruit and milk that Mrs Forbes gave her for her
late lunch and said that she felt better

You look so returned the housekeeper The child had not once called
her upstairs during the morning She certainly was as little trouble as
a sick child could be

If t was anybody else mused Mrs Forbes regarding her I should
say that she sensed the situation and knew shed brought it on herself
and me and was trying to make up for it but nobody can tell what she
thinks Her eyes do look more natural I guess Dr Ballards a good
one

It dont seem to hurt you to swallow now remarked Mrs Forbes

Nom it doesnt she answered

Now then you see how foolish and naughty it was the way you behaved
about having the doctor this morning Look how much better you are
already

Yesm I love Dr Ballard

You well may Hes done well by you Mrs Forbes took the tray Now
do you feel like going to sleep again The doctor wont come till about
six oclock Your feverll rise toward evening and thats the time he
wants to see you I shall sleep in the spare room next you tonight

Thank you Mrs Forbes You are so kind but you wont have to
replied the child earnestly Would you please draw up the curtains
and put Anna Belles clothes on the bed Perhaps Ill dress her after a
while It doesnt seem fair to make her stay in bed when it wasnt her
error

I dont think youd better keep your arms out returned Mrs Forbes
decidedly Ill put up the curtains but when you come to try to do
anything youll find you are very weak You can ring the bell when you
want to you know And dont take your medicine again for an hour after
eating Id take another nap right away if I was you

When she had gone out Jewel shook her head at the doll whose face was
smiling toward her own You denied it didnt you dearie the minute
she said it she whispered Error is using Mrs Forbes to hold me
under mortal mind laws but it cant be so because God doesnt want it
and Im not afraid any more

Jewel put her hand under her pillow and drew out the two slips of paper
that bore her mothers messages These she read through several times
Of course there are more Anna Belle I shouldnt wonder if there was
one in every pocket but I dont mean to hunt Divine love will send
them to me just when I need them the way He did these Im sorry I
cant dress you dearie because youve just reflected love all the
time and ought not to be in bed at all but I must obey you know so
there wont be discord Id love to just hop up and get your clothes
but youll forgive me for not I know

Again Jewel put her hand under her pillow and drew forth her copy of
Science and Health Ill read to you a little dearie She opened
the book to page 393 and read Rise in the strength of Spirit to resist
all that is unlike God Jewel paused and thought for a minute You
might think Anna Belle that that meant rise against Mrs Forbes but
it doesnt It means rise against all error and one error is believing
that Mrs Forbes is cross or afraid She went on reading for several
minutes passing glibly over familiar phrases and sticking at or
skipping words which presented difficulties

While she was thus employed Eloise again stole quietly to her cousins
door and hearing the soft voice she grew pale Her mother had exacted
a promise from her that she would not enter the room until Dr Ballard
consented so after a minutes hesitation she fled downstairs and found
Mrs Forbes

I think the little girl must be worse She is talking to herself
incessantly

Mrs Forbes regarded the pale face coldly I guess theres some
mistake She was better when I saw her half an hour ago Ill go up in a
minute

The minute stretched to five Jewel had slept scarcely at all the night
before and by the time the housekeeper had laboriously reached her
door her voice had grown fainter then stopped and she was sound
asleep

I wish Mamzell would keep her finger out of this pie soliloquized
Mrs Forbes as she retraced her steps

When Mr Evringham returned from the city his first question as Zeke
met him was concerning Jewel

Mother says shes slept the most of the day replied the coachman his
head stiff in his high collar and his eyes looking straight ahead

Hm A good sign does she think or is it stupor

I couldnt say sir

Reaching the house a long pasteboard box in his hands Mr Evringham
found that his grandchild was still asleep

I fear the worst Mrs Forbes he said with nervous curtness When a
stupor attacks children it is a very bad sign I am told Ill just ring
up Ballard

He did so but the doctor had gone out and was intending to call at the
park before he returned

I really think it is all right Mr Evringham said Mrs Forbes
distressed by her employers uneasiness Dr Ballard expected shed
sleep a great deal He told me not to disturb her

Oh very well then perhaps it is not to be regretted Kindly put those
roses in the deep vase Mrs Forbes

Yes sir She took up the box Besides Mr Evringham if she does
get worse you know the hospital here is one of the very best and
you

Mr Evringham wheeled and frowned upon the speaker fiercely Hospital
he ejaculated An extraordinary suggestion Mrs Forbes Most
extraordinary My granddaughter remains in my house

Mrs Forbes crimson with surprise and mortification retreated Very
well sir she faltered Will you have the roses on the dinner table
Mr Evringham

No Set them here on my desk if you please With this Mr Evringham
began walking up and down the floor pausing once to take up the yellow
chicken During the day the soft moan I wanted you so all night
grandpa had been ringing in his ears

Mrs Forbes has no understanding of the child he muttered and of
course I cannot expect anything from the cat and her kitten

With this he began again his promenade Mrs Forbes returned with the
roses and simultaneously Mr Evringham saw Essex Maid arching her neck
as she picked her steps past the window

By the way he said curtly let Zeke take the Maid back to the barn
Ill not ride today

Its very fine weather sir protested Mrs Forbes

Ill not ride Ill wait here for Dr Ballard

The housekeeper went forth to give the order

I never saw Mr Evringham so upset in my life she said in an
awestruck tone

I saw the governor wasnt real comfortable returned the boy Guess
hes afraid hes goin to catch the mumps or something It would be real
harrowin if he got any worse case of big head than hes got already

Mr Evringham was little accustomed to waiting and by the time Dr
Ballard appeared his nervousness had become painful The childs slept
too much Im sure of it Ballard was his greeting I dont know what
were going to find up there I declare I dont

It depends on whether its a good sleep returned the doctor and his
composed face and manner acted at once beneficially upon Mr Evringham

Well youll know Guy youll know my boy Mrs Forbes saw you
coming and she has gone upstairs to prepare the little girl Shell be
glad to see you this time Ill wager

The broker roses in hand ascended the staircase after the physician
Mrs Forbes was standing at the foot of the bed and the room was
pleasantly light as they entered Jewel the flush of sleep on her
cheeks was looking expectantly toward the door Dr Ballard came in
first and she smiled in welcome then Mr Evringham appeared heavy
roses nodding in all directions before him

Grandpa exclaimed the child Why grandpa did _you_ come

There was no mistaking the joy in her tone Dr Ballard paused in
surprise while the stockbroker approached the bed

I brought you a few flowers Jewel he said while she pressed his
disengaged hand against her cheek

Theyre the most lovely ones I ever saw she returned with conviction
They make me happy just to look at them

Well Jewel said the doctor I hear youve been making up for
lost sleep in great shape His eyes as he spoke were taking in with
concentrated interest the signs in her face He came and sat beside the
bed while Mr Evringham fell back and Mrs Forbes regarded the child
critically

Well now youre a good little patient went on the doctor as he
noted the clear eyes

Yes Dr Ballard I feel just as nice as can be she answered

No thickness in the voice I fancy that sore throat is better The
young doctor could not repress his smile of satisfaction I was certain
that was the right attenuation he thought Now let us see

He took out the little thermometer and Jewel submitted to having it
slipped beneath her tongue

As Dr Ballard leaned back in his chair to wait he looked up at Mr
Evringham It is very gratifying he said to find these conditions
at this hour of the day I felt a little more uneasy this morning than I
confessed He nodded in satisfactory thought I grant you medicine is
not an exact science it is an art an art You cant prescribe by hard
and fast rules You must take into consideration the personal equation

Presently he leaned forward and removed the thermometer His eyes smiled
as he read it and he lifted it toward Mr Evringham

I cant see it boy

Well theres nothing to see She hasnt a particle of temperature
Look here little one frowning at Jewel if everybody recovered as
quickly as you have where would we doctors be

Turning again and addressing Mr Evringham he went on Im
particularly interested in this result because that is a remedy over
which there has been some altercation Theres one man to whom I shall
be glad to relate this experience The doctor leaned toward his
little patient Jewel Im not so surprised as I might be at your
improvement he said kindly You will have to excuse me for a little
righteous deception I put medicine into that glass of water and now
youre glad I did arent you Id like you to tell me little girl as
near as you can how often you took it

I didnt take it replied the child

Dr Ballard drew back a little You mean he said after a moment you
took it only once

No sir I didnt take it at all

There was a silence during which all could hear the ticking of the
clock on the table and the three pairs eyes were fixed on Jewel with
such varying expressions of amazement and disapproval that the childs
breath began to come faster

Didnt you drink any of the water asked Dr Ballard at last

Yes out of the pitcher

Why not out of the glass

It didnt look enough I was so thirsty

They could not doubt her

Mr Evringham finally found his voice

Jewel why didnt you obey the doctor His eyes and voice were so
serious that she stretched out her arm

Oh grandpa she said please let me take hold of your hand

No not till you answer me Little girls should be obedient

Jewel thought a minute

He said it wasnt medicine so what was the use she asked

Mr Evringham seeming to find an answer to this difficult bit the end
of his mustache

Dr Ballard was feeling his very ears grow red while Mrs Forbess lips
were set in a line of exasperation

Grandpa said Jewel and the childs voice was very earnest theres
a Bible over there on the table You look in there in the Gospels and
youll find everywhere how Jesus tells us to do what Ive done He said
he must go away but he would send the Comforter to us and this book
tells about the Comforter Jewel took the copy of Science and Health
from under the sheet

Gods creation couldnt get sick Its just His own image and likeness
so how could it And when you can get right into Gods love what do you
want of medicine to swallow God wouldnt be omnipotent if He needed any
help You see Im well Isnt that all you want grandpa

The appeal of her eyes caused the broker to stir undecidedly I never
did have any use for doctors he thought after the manner of many who
nevertheless are eager to fly to the brotherhood for help at the first
suggestion of pain Moreover the humor of the situation was beginning
to dawn upon him and he admired the fine temper and selfcontrol with
which the young physician pulled himself together and rose

_I_ am glad you are well Jewel very he said but the next time I
am called to prescribe for a little Christian Scientist I shall put
the pellets on her tongue He smiled as he took up his case and said
goodby

Mr Evringham followed him down the stairs heroically resisting the
impulse to laugh Only one remark he allowed himself as he bade the
doctor goodby

Youre quite right Ballard in your theory Jewel has been here only
three days but I could have told you that in doing anything whatever
for her it is always absolutely necessary to consider the personal
equation



CHAPTER XIII

IN THE LIBRARY

As Mr Evringham turned from the closed door he met his daughterinlaw
coming out into the hall

Ive been watching for Dr Ballard she said with annoyance I dont
see why I didnt hear him come down At this juncture she paused
surprised to observe that her fatherinlaw was laughing She attributed
this unusual ebullition to ridicule of herself

I only wanted to ask if Julias illness is infectious she went on
with dignity Eloise and I are naturally very anxious We should like
to do anything for her we can if it is quite safe

Madam dont I pray for all our sakes run any risk returned Mr
Evringham his lips still twitching as he bowed mockingly

It would be very foolish answered Mrs Evringham unabashed You
wouldnt care to have more invalids on your hands It has been all I
could do to keep Eloise away from the sick room today

Is it possible commented Mr Evringham smoothing his mustache

Not only possible but true and I wished to go to headquarters and find
out the exact state of the case

Again the brokers shoulders began to shake

Ballard isnt headquarters he replied

Mrs Evringham regarded him startled She wondered if affairs were
perhaps very serious and her fatherinlaws nerves overstrained
She knew that he had dispensed with the afternoon ride which was so
important to him

She grew a shade paler I wish you would tell me father just what the
doctor said she begged

Mr Evringham raised a protesting hand I couldnt think of it he
laughed It would give me apoplexy

His daughterinlaw began to retreat and the broker passed her and went
into his study still laughing

Mrs Evringham stood with lips parted looking after him Her heart beat
fast The doctor had called twice He had come down the stairs in dead
silence just now She knew it for she had been listening and waiting
to intercept him She had meant to say a number of pretty things to him
concerning Eloises anxiety about her little cousin Her own anxiety
redoubled and she hurried to her daughters room and narrated her
experience

I really think we may have to go Eloise she finished nervously
Even if it isnt infectious it is so dreadfully dispiriting to be in a
house where there is a dangerous illness and possibly worse Ive been
thinking perhaps we might go in town and take lodgings for a while No
one need know it We could even stay there through the summer None of
our friends would be in town then in autumn we could come back here

Eloises lip curled I doubt that she returned Grandfather will
be forearmed I prophesy mother that you will never get our trunks up
here again after you once take them out

Really Eloise you do put things most repulsively returned Mrs
Evringham with vexation Besides how do we know what the future is
going to bring forth Father behaves to me as if he might be on the
verge of brain fever himself

Poor little Jewel exclaimed the girl I hope she will pull through
but if she is the cause of our leaving here I shall always love her
memory

I dont know whether father will even come to dinner said Mrs
Evringham pursuing her own thoughts but I suppose we shall see Mrs
Forbes I do hope she has some sense about using disinfectants Its
outrageous for her to come near the diningroom when she is taking care
of that child Of course theyll have a nurse at once Forbes doesnt
like going out of her beaten track

I cant forget that poor little voice rambling on so monotonously this
afternoon said Eloise I strained my ears to listen but I could
make out only that she said something about love and then about
righteousness What a word for that little mouth

Ive seen smaller remarked Mrs Evringham

When finally they entered the diningroom punctually at the appointed
houreven Mrs Evringham dared take no liberties with thatthe host
was there and greeted them as usual Mrs Forbes came in and took her
position near him Her employer gave her a side glance His fears for
Jewel allayed his regard for his housekeepers opinions had returned in
full force

He wished to ask for the little girl to ask what she was doing now and
what she would like sent up for dinner but he had not the courage The
aghast countenance which Mrs Forbes had exhibited at the moment when
the enormity of Jewels conduct transpired remained in his memory The
housekeepers appearance at present was noncommittal Mrs Evringham
sent her piercing and questioning glances in vain

The silence in the usually silent room had not had time to become
noticeable when the portiere was pushed aside and Jewel arrayed in
the dotted dress and carefully bearing the tall vase of nodding roses
entered the room

Mrs Evringham uttered a little cry and dropped her spoon Eloise stared
wildeyed The housekeeper flushed

Good evening said the child glancing about as she approached and
sighing with relief as she set the heavy vase on the edge of the table
I had to come down so carefully not to spill grandpa that it made
me a little late Mrs Forbes said you brought me the roses under
falsefalse pretends so I thought perhaps you would like them on the
table

The housekeeper hurrying forward seized the vase from its precarious
position and placed it in the centre of the board I didnt tell you
you might come downstairs she said as she buttoned the middle button
of Jewels dress

The little girl looked up in innocent surprise You said I might dress
me so why should anybody have to bring up my dinner she asked

Mrs Forbess countenance looked so lowering that Mr Evringham hastened
to speak in his brusque and final fashion She is here now Might as
well let her stay

Jewel jumped into her chair and turned toward him with an apologetic
smile I couldnt make my hair look very nice she said with the
lift of her shoulders which he had come to connect with her confidential
moments Remembering the feverish child of the morning he looked at her
in silent wonder The appearance of her flaxen head he could see was
in contrast to the trim and wellcaredfor look it had worn when she
arrived

Poor little thing he thought She looks motherlessmotherless
Involuntarily he cast a glance of impatience at his other guests The
expression of blank amazement on their faces stirred him to amusement

If you are afraid of infection Madge dont hesitate to retire to your
room he said Your dinner will be sent to you

What does this mean ejaculated Mrs Evringham Why is Dr Ballard
coming twice a day to see that child

To cure her of course returned the broker his lips breaking into
smiles Why do doctors generally visit patients

Then when he came the second time he found her well

Ha ha laughed Mr Evringham yes thats it He found her well

Eloise and her mother gazed at him in astonishment Mrs Forbess
face was immovable A sense of humor was not included in her mental
equipment and she considered the whole affair lamentable and unseemly
in the extreme

Grandpa said Jewel looking at him with gentle reproach youre not
laughing at Dr Ballard are you Hes the _kindest_ man I love him
next to you best of anybody in BelAirthen thinking this declaration
might hurt her aunt and cousin she added because I know him the best
you know He tried to deceive me about the medicine but it was only
because he didnt know that there isnt any righteous deceiving He
meant to do me good

Mrs Evringham looked curiously from the child to her fatherinlaw As
she herself said later she had never felt so out of it in her life
As the subject concerned Dr Ballard she wished to understand clearly
what circumstance could possibly have induced Mr Evringham to laugh
repeatedly

I was passing your door this afternoon said Eloise addressing Jewel
and I heard you talking I knew there was no one with you and I feared
you were very ill

The little girl was always pleased when her beautiful cousin looked at
her

I guess I was reading Of course I was in a hurry to get well so as
soon as the fever was gone and I felt comfortable I began to read
out loud from Science and Health to Anna Belle Shes a Christian
Scientist too

The faces of Mrs Evringham and Eloise were studies as they gazed at the
speaker

Mr Evringham glanced at them maliciously under his heavy brows as Sarah
brought in the second course

Is Anna Belle your doll asked Eloise for the moment sufficiently
interested almost to lose her selfconsciousness

Yes eagerly Would you like to see her Jewel gave a fleeting
glance at Mrs Forbes She always comes to the table with me at home
she added

Sit still murmured Mrs Forbes in low sepulchral warning

Now then Jewel said Mr Evringham as he began to serve the filet
you didnt take the doctors medicine What do you think made that high
fever go away

The little girl looked up brightly Oh I telegraphed to Mrs Lewis
one of mothers friends in Chicago to treat me

The devWhat do you mean child

Mr Evringham gazed at her and his tone was so fierce although he was
only very much amazed that Jewels smile faded The corners of her
lips drew down pitifully and suddenly she slipped from her chair and
running to him threw her arms around his neck and buried her averted
face revealing two forlorn little flaxen pigtails devoid of ribbons

Whats this Jewel he said quickly fearfully embarrassed before his
wondering audience This is very irregular very irregular He dropped
his fork perforce and his hand closed over the little arm across his
cravat

Jewel was trying to control a sob that struggled to escape and saying
over and over as nearly as he could understand something about God
being Love

Go right back to your chair now like a good girl

Do youlove me whispered Jewel

Yesyes I do

You spoke likea soblike hating

Not at all not at all rejoined Mr Evringham quickly but I was
very much surprised very

Shall I take her upstairs sir asked Mrs Forbes nearly bursting
with the outrage of such an interruption to her employers sacred
dinner

No shes going to sit right down in her chair and not make any
trouble Dont you like those roses I brought you Jewel he added
awkwardly hoping to make a diversion He was successful She lowered
her face a fleeting April smile flitting over it

Did grandfather bring you those lovely roses asked Eloise

Mr Evringham flashed her his first glance of approval for so quickly
taking the cue

Yes replied the child her breath catching as she went back to her
chair I seemed so sick when he went away this morning was the reason
so now Im well againthey belong to everybody dont they grandpa

Mr Evringham paused to consider a reply He desired to be careful in
public not to draw upon himself that small catapult

They belong to you still Jewel I never take back my presents he
returned at last

And I think Mrs Forbes was mistaken about the false pretends said
the child swallowing and looking apologetically at the housekeeper
because who would pretend such error as sickness and of course youd
know I didnt pretend

Certainly not said Mr Evringham Mrs Forbes didnt mean that The
whole thing seems like a dream now he added

What else could it seem like returned Jewel smiling faintly toward
her grandfather with an air of having caught him napping

Like reality he returned dryly

She gazed at him her smile fading

He looked up apprehensively and cringed a little not at all sure that
the next instant would not find the roseleaf cheek next his and a
close whisper driving cold chills down his back but the child only
paused a moment

Reality is so much different from sin disease and death she said at
last in a matteroffact manner It was too much for Mrs Evringhams
risibles She laughed in spite of her daughters reproachful glance

How wonderful if true she exclaimed

It is true returned Jewel soberly Even Anna Belle knows that but
Im sure that you havent learned anything about Christian Science aunt
Madge she added politely

What makes you so sure returned Mrs Evringham banteringly

Jewel flushed with embarrassment and glanced at her grandfather
involuntarily but he was busy eating and evidently would not help her

Id rather not say replied the child at last and her rejoinder
incited her aunt to further merriment

Aunt Madge doesnt laugh in a nice way thought Jewel Its even
pleasanter when she looks sorry

What is real then Jewel asked Eloise gravely

The child flashed upon her a sweet look

Everything good and glad she answered

Something rose in the girls throat and she pressed her lips together
for an instant

You are happy to believe that she returned

Oh I dont believe it replied Jewel Its one of the things I
_know_ Mother says we only believe things when we arent sure about
them Mother knows such a lot of beautiful truth

The child looked at her cousin wistfully as she spoke Eloise could
scarcely retain her proud and nonchalant bearing beneath the blue eyes
They seemed to see through to her wretchedness

She did not look at Jewel again during dinner At the close Mr
Evringham pushed his chair back

I should like you to come with me into my study Jewel for a few
minutes

The childs face brightened and she left the table with alacrity Mr
Evringham stood back to allow his guests to pass out They went on to
the drawingroom where Mrs Evringhams selfrestraint was loosed

The plot thickens Eloise she said

And we are not going away returned the girl

Decidedly not declared her mother with emphasis

There is no hope of our catching anything that Jewel has now went on
Eloise

Her mother glanced at her suspiciously What for instance

Oh returned the girl shrugging her shoulder faith hope and
charity

Mrs Evringham laughed Indeed Is the wind in that quarter Then with
the Christian Science microbe in the house theres no telling what may
happen to you Something more serious than a fever perhaps She nodded
knowingly This sudden recovery looks very queer to me Id keep the
child in bed if I were in authority Some diseases are so treacherous
Theres walking typhoid fever for instance She may have it for all we
know I shall have a very serious talk with Dr Ballard when he comes

An ironical smile flitted over the girls lips as she drifted toward the
piano I judge from the remarks at the table that the less you say to
Dr Ballard on the subject of todays experiences the better

I know it indignantly Im sure that child must have played some
practical joke on him I want to get to the bottom of it What a strange
little monkey she is How long will father stand it What did you think
Eloise when she swooped upon him so suddenly

I thought of just one sentence returned the girl Perfect love
casteth out fear

Why in the world should she love him protested Mrs Evringham

She would love us all if we would let her returned Eloise the
phrases of Vogel als Prophete beginning to ripple softly from beneath
her fingers I saw it from the first I felt it that first evening
when we behaved toward her like a couple of boors Any one can see she
has never been snubbed never neglected She got out of the lap of love
to come to this icebox No wonder the change of temperature made her
ill

Why Eloise what has come over you You never used to be disagreeable
Its a good thing the child is amiable Its the only thing left for a
plain girl to be

No one will ever remember that she is plain remarked Eloise

Her mother raised her eyebrows doubtingly Perhaps your perceptions are
so keen that you can explain how Jewel managed to telegraph to Chicago
today she said It reminded me of Dooleys comments on Christian
Science Do you remember what he said about rejucin a swellin over a
long distance tillyphone

I cant imagine how she managed it admitted Eloise



Neither could Mr Evringham He had taken Jewel into his study now
with the intention of finding out deeming a secluded apartment more
desirable for catechism which might lay him liable to personal attack

As they entered the library he turned on the light and Jewel glanced
about with her usual alert and ready admiration

Is this your own own particular room grandpa she asked

Yes where I keep all my books and papers

The childs eye suddenly lighted on the yellow chicken and she looked
up at Mr Evringham with a pleased smile He had forgotten the chicken
and took the seat before his desk glancing vaguely about to see which
chair would be least heavy and ponderous for his guest She settled
the matter without any hesitation by jumping upon his knee Jewel had a
subject on her mind which pressed heavily and before her companion
had had time to do more than wink once or twice in his surprise she
proceeded to it

Do you know grandpa I think its hard for Mrs Forbes to love people
very much she said in a lowered voice as if perhaps the walls might
have ears I wanted to ask her yesterday morning if she didnt love me
whom she had seen how could she love God whom she hadnt seen Grandpa
would you be willing to tie my bows

To tierepeated Mr Evringham and paused

The child was gazing into his eyes earnestly She put her hand into her
pocket and took out two long pieces of blue ribbon

You see youre my only real relation she explained and so I dont
like to ask anybody else

The startled look in her grandfathers face moved her to proceed
encouragingly

You tie your neckties just beautifully grandpa and Mrs Forbes does
her duty so _hard_ and she wants to have my hair cut off to save
trouble Jewel put her hand up to one short pigtail protectingly

And you dont want it cut off eh

No and mother wouldnt either So it would be error and Im sure I
could learn to fix it better than I did tonight if you would tie the
bows Just try one right now grandpa

With the house full of women gasped Mr Evringham

But none of them my real relatives replied Jewel and she turned the
back of her head to him putting the ribbons in his hands

His fingers fumbled at the task for a minute and his breathing began to
be heavy

Is it hard grandpa she asked sympathetically You can do it
You reflect intelligence Then in an instant Oh Ive thought of
something She whisked about took the ribbons and tied one tightly
around the end of each braid then ducking her forehead into his shirt
front Now put your arms around my neck and tie the bow just as if it
was on yourself Eureka The thing was accomplished and Mrs Forbes
outwitted The broker was rather pleased with himself at the billowy
appearance of the ribbon which covered such a multitude of sins in the
way of bad parting and braiding He took his handkerchief and wiped
the beads of perspiration from his brow while Jewel regarded him with
admiring affection

I knew you could do just _anything_ grandpa she said You see
looking off at a mental vision of the housekeeper we could come in
here every morning for a minute before breakfast and shed never know
would she The child lifted her shoulders and laughed softly with
pleasure at the plot

Mr Evringham saw his opportunity to take the floor

Now Jewel I would like to have you explain what you meant by saying
that you telegraphed to Chicago today when you didnt leave your bed

She looked up at him attentively Ezekiel took it for me she replied

Mr Evringham unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief at this commonplace
information His knowledge of the claims of Christian Science was
extremely vague and he had feared being obliged to listen to a
declaration of the use of some means of communication which would make
Marconis discoveries appear like clumsy makeshifts

But I think grandpa perhaps youd better not tell Mrs Forbes

How did you manage to see Zeke

I asked his mother if he might come to see me before he took you to the
train

Mr Evringham pulled his mustache in amusement Did he pay for the
telegram

Why no grandpa I told you I had plenty of money

And you think that Mrs Somebody in Chicago cured you

Of course not God did

But she asked Him eh

Jewels innocent eyes looked directly into the quizzical ones Its
pretty hard for a little girl to teach you about it if you dont know
she said doubtfully

I _dont_ know he replied his mood altered by her tone but I
should like to know what you think about it Your cure was a rather
surprising one to us all

I can tell you some of the things I know

Do so then

Wella pausethere wasnt anything to cure you see

Ah You werent ill then

Noo scornfully of course not I knew it all the time but it
seemed so real to me and so hot I knew Id have to have some one else
handle the claim for me

It certainly did seem rather real Mr Evringham smiled

Jewel saw that he did not in the least comprehend

You know there isnt any devil dont you grandpa she asked
patiently

Well sometimes I have my doubts

The little girl tried to discover by his eyes if he were in earnest

If you believe there is then you could believe that I was really
sick but if you believe there isnt and that God created everybody and
everything then it is so easy to understand that I wasnt Think of God
creating anything bad

Mr Evringham nodded vaguely When mother comes home shell tell you
about it if you want her to She sighed a little and abruptly changed
the subject Grandpa are you going to be working at your desk

Yes for a while

Could I sit over at that table and write a letter while youre busy I
wouldnt speak She slipped down from his knee

I dont know about your having ink Youre a rather small girl to be
writing letters

Oh no Ill take a pencilbecause sometimes I move quickly and ink
tips over

Quite so Im glad you realize that else I should be afraid to have
you come to my study

Youd better not be afraid the child shook her head sagely because
that makes things happen

Her grandfather regarded her curiously This small Bible student who
couldnt tie her own hair ribbons was an increasing problem to him



CHAPTER XIV

FAMILY AFFAIRS

He continued to watch the child furtively while she made her
arrangements for writing Finding that no chair in the room would bring
her to a proper height for the table she looked all about and finally
skipped over to the morocco lounge and tugged from it a pillow almost
too heavy for her to carry but she arrived with it at the chair
much to the amusement of Mr Evringham who affected absorption in
his papers while he enjoyed the exhibition of the childs energy and
independence

Shes the kind that makes old shears cut as my mother used to say
he mused and turning the better to view the situation he found Jewel
mounted on her perch and watching him fixedly

She looked relieved I didnt want to disturb you grandpa but may I
ask one question

Yes

Did I consult Dr Ballard this afternoon

Not that I noticed returned Mr Evringham and Jewel suspected from
his expression that she had said something amusing

Well it was a word that sounded like consult that Mrs Forbes said I
did

Insult perhaps suggested Mr Evringham

Oh yes How do you spell it grandpa

Mr Evringham told her and added dryly That was rather too strong
language for Mrs Forbes to apply to the fact

Yes replied the child I knew it was a hating word Then without
further parley she squared her elbows on the table and bent over her
sheet of paper

I wonder what version of it shell give her mother thought the
broker rummaging vaguely in the pigeon holes of his desk His labors
finally sifted down to the unearthing of a late novel from a drawer at
his right hand and lowering a convenient greenshaded electric light
he lit his cigar and was soon lost in the pages of the story

At last he became conscious that the pencil at the table had ceased to
move and lowering his book he looked up His granddaughter had been
watching for this happy event and she no sooner met his eyes than with
a smile of satisfaction she jumped from her morocco perch and brought
him a sheet of paper well and laboriously covered

I suppose it isnt all spelled right she said I didnt want to
disturb you to ask but will you please direct this to Dr Ballard

To Dr Ballard repeated Mr Evringham His curiosity impelled him
Shall I see if it is spelled right

Jewel assenting he read the following in a large and waving hand

DEAR DOCTOR BALUDMrs Forbs felt bad because I did not take your
Medsin She said it was an insult I want to tell you I did not meen an
Insult We cant help loving God beter than any body but I love you and
if I took any medsin I would rather take yours than any boddys Mrs
Forbs says you will send a big Bill to Grandpa and that it was error to
waist it Please send the Bill to me because I have Plenty of munny and
I shall love to pay you You were very kind and did not put any thing on
my Tung

Your loving JEWEL


Mr Evringham continued to look at the signature for a minute before he
spoke Jewel was leaning against his arm and reading with him The last
lines slanted deeply there being barely room in the lower corner for
the writers name

I cant write very straight without lines she said

You do very well indeed he returned About that bill Jewel he
added after a moment Perhaps you would better let me pay it I believe
you said you had three dollars but even that wont last forever you
know Youve spent some of it too How much now

Ive spent fifty cents Jewel cast a furtive look around at the
chicken And oh yes fifty cents more for the telegram How much do
you think Dr Ballards bill will be

I think it will take every cent you have left returned Mr Evringham
gravely curious to hear what his granddaughter would say in this
dilemma

Her reply came promptly and even eagerly Well thats all right
because Divine Love will send me more if I need it

Indeed How can you be sure

Jewel smiled at him affectionately Do you mean it grandpa

Why yes I really want to know

Even after God sent you Essex Maid she asked incredulously

You think the mare is the best thing in my possession eh

Yees Dont you

I believe I do As Mr Evringham spoke this kinship of taste induced
him to turn his face toward the one beside him Instantly he found
himself kissed full on the lips and while he was recovering from the
shock Jewel proceeded

God has given you so many things grandpa thats why it surprised me
to have you look so sorry when I first came The child examined his
countenance critically I dont think you look so sorry as you used to
I know you must have lots of error to meet and perhaps lowering her
voice to an extra gentleness perhaps you dont know how to remember
every minute that God is a very present help in trouble Mother says
that even grownup people are just finding out about it

As she paused Mr Evringham hesitated somewhat embarrassed under
the blue eyes We all have plenty to learn I dare say he returned
vaguely

He had more than once wished that he had taken more notice of Harrys
wife during his opportunity at the hotel He had looked upon the
interview as a distasteful necessity to be disposed of as cursorily as
possible

His son had married beneath him some working girl probably whose
ability to support herself had turned out to be a deliverance for
her fatherinlaw when the neerdowell husband shirked his
responsibilities and Mr Evringham had gone to the hotel that evening
intending to make it clear that although he performed a favor for his
son there were no results to follow

His granddaughters fearlessness courtesy and affection had forced
him to wonder as to the mother who had fostered these qualities He
remembered the eloquence of his sons face when Harry expressed the wish
that he might know Julia and a vague admiration and respect were being
born in the brokers heart for the deserted woman who had worked with
hand and brain for her childhis grandchild was the way he put itwith
such results as he saw

Some perception of what Harrys sensations must have been during the
last six months came to him as he sat there with the little girls arm
about him Harry had come home and discovered his child his Jewel A
frown gathered on the brokers brow as he realized the hours of vain
regret his son must have suffered for those lost years of the childs
life

Served him right served him perfectly right

What grandpa

The question made Mr Evringham aware that the indignant words had been
muttered above his breath

I was thinking of your father he replied Has he learned these
things that your mother has taught you

Oh yes with soft eagerness father is learning everything Jewel
saw her grandfathers frown and she lowered her voice almost to a
whisper Dont feel sorry about father grandpa He says hes the
happiest man in the world Mother didnt find out about God till after
father had gone to California or he wouldnt have gone and for a long
time she didnt know where he was and I was only beginning to walk
around so I couldnt help her but when I got bigger I had fathers
picture and we used to talk to it every day and at last mother knew
that Divine Love would bring father back and pretty soon he began
to write to her and he said he couldnt come home because he felt so
sorry and he was going to the war So then mother and I prayed a great
deal every day and we knew father would be taken care of And then
mother kept writing to him not to be sorry because error was nothing
and the child of God could always have his right place and everything
like that and at last the war was over and he came home Jewel paused

Mr Evringham wondered what she was seeing with that faraway look

Presently she turned to him with the smile of irresistible
sweetnessHarrys smileand a surprising fullness came in the brokers
throat Fathers just splendid she finished

Her grandfather was not wholly pleased with the verdict He had gained a
taste for incense himself

He has been at home over six months I believe he returned

Yes all winter and we have more _fun_

Your father is not a Christian Scientist I presume remarked Mr
Evringham

Oh yes hes learning to be Of course he goes to church

He does eh put in the broker surprised

Of course and he studies the lesson with us every day He had been
sorry so much and so long you know mother said he was all ready and
besidebesideJewel hesitated and became silent

Beside what

She began very softly and half reluctantly Father had a sickness two
or three times when he first came home and he was healed and so he was
very grateful and wanted to know about God

Hm Im glad he was I hope he will make your mother very happy after
this

He does The child lost her seriousness and laughed reminiscently
Father and I have the _best_ times Mothers says hes younger than I
am

You miss him eh Mr Evringham half frowned into the fresh little
face

Oh yes I do with a sigh but it would be error to be sorry when I
could come to see you grandpa

Mr Evringham cogitated a minute on the probable loneliness of the last
three days and began to wonder what this philosophy could be which
gave practical help to a child of eight years He was still holding the
letter to Dr Ballard in his hand

I think Ill let you direct this yourself Jewel he said He rose and
brought the morocco cushion to his desk chair Sit up here and I will
tell you the address

She obeyed and Mr Evringham watched the little fingers clenched around
the pen as she strove to resist its tendency to write down hill on the
envelope

And youre quite sure that more money will be forthcoming when yours is
gone eh he asked when the feat was accomplished

Oh yes if I need it

How will it come for instance

She looked up quickly I dont need to know that she replied

Mr Evringham bit his lip Thats unanswerable he thought and
rather neat

At this moment a knock sounded at the library door and a moment
afterward Mrs Forbes presented herself

Excuse me Mr Evringham Im afraid Julia has been in your way
staying so long

No Mrs Forbes thank you he returned She had a letter to write
and I have been reading

Very well It is her bedtime now The housekeepers tone was
inexorable and Jewel lifted her shoulders as she glanced up at her
grandfather and again he found himself taken into a confidence which
excluded his excellent housekeeper It is better for us to yield said
Jewels shoulders and mute lips Before Mr Evringham could suspect her
intention she had jumped up on the cushion nimbly as a squirrel and
hugging him in a businesslike manner kissed him twice

Goodnight grandpa

Goodnight Jewel he returned going to the length of patting her
shoulder

She jumped down and ran to Mrs Forbes You neednt come with me you
know she said holding up her face Mrs Forbes hesitated a moment
She had not as yet recovered from this latest liberty taken with the
head of the house

Let me feel of your hands Julia She took them in hers and touched
the childs cheeks and forehead as well You seem to feel all right do
you

Yesm

No soreness or pain anywhere

Nom Goodnight Mrs Forbes

The housekeeper stooped from her height and accepted the offered kiss

Do you prefer to go alone Jewel Isnt it lonely for you asked Mr
Evringham

Noo grandpa Anna Belle is up there

Youre not afraid of the dark then

Jewel looked at the speaker uncertain of his seriousness He seemed in
earnest however The dark is easy to drive away in this house she
replied It is so interesting just like a treatment The room seems
full of darkness error and I just turn the switch she illustrated
with thumb and finger in the air and suddenlythere isnt any
darkness Its all bright and happy just like me today

Indeed returned Mr Evringham standing with his feet apart and his
arms folded Is that what the lady in Chicago did for you today

Yes grandpa Jewel nodded eagerly She was so glad to have him
understand She just turned the light Truth right into me

She prayed to the Creator to cure you you mean

Jewel looked off No not that she answered slowly searching for
words to make her meaning plain God doesnt have to be begged to do
anything because He cant change He is always the same and always
perfect and always giving us everything good and its only for usnot
to believein the things that seem to get in the way I was believing
there was something in the way and that lady knew there wasnt and
she knew it so _well_ that the old dark fever couldnt stay Nothing can
stay that God doesnt makenot any longer than we let it cheat us

And she was a thousand miles away remarked Mr Evringham

Why grandpa returned Jewel there isnt any space in Spirit She
gave a little sigh Im real sorry youre too big to be let into the
Christian Science SundaySchool

Mrs Forbes lips fell apart

One moment more Jewel said Mr Evringham Mrs Forbes was telling
me of the gentleman who spoke to you on the trolley car yesterday

Oh yes returned the child smiling at the pleasing memory The
Christian Scientist

What makes you think he is a Christian Scientist asked Mr Evringham

I know he was He had on the pin Jewel showed the one she wore and
her grandfather examined the little cross and crown curiously

I wonder if its possible he soliloquized aloud

Oh yes grandpa he is one and if hes a friend of yours he can
explain to you so much better than a little girl can

After the child had left the room Mr Evringham and his housekeeper
stood regarding one another His usually unsmiling countenance was
relaxed Mrs Forbes observed his novel expression but did not suspect
that the light twinkling in his deepset eyes was partly due to the
sight of her own pentup emotion

He hooked one thumb in his vest and balanced his eyeglasses in his other
hand

Well what do you think of her he inquired

I think sir returned the housekeeper emphatically that if anybody
bought that child for a fool he wouldnt get his moneys worth

Even though she is a Scientist added Mr Evringham his mustache
curving in a smile

Shes too smart for me I dont like children to be so smart The idea
of her setting up to teach you Mr Evringham

That shouldnt be so surprising I read a long time ago something about
certain things being concealed from the wise and prudent and revealed
unto babes

Babes repeated Mrs Forbes Weve been the babes If that young one
can lie in bed with a fever and wind every one of us around her finger
the way shes done today what can we expect when shes up and around

The broker laughed Shes an Evringham an Evringham he said

You may laugh sir but what do you think of her wheedling me into
sending Zeke up and then getting him off on the sly with that telegram
I faced him down with it tonight and Zeke isnt any good at fibbing

Ill be hanged if I dont think it was a pretty good thing for me
rejoined Mr Evringham and money in my pocket It looked as if I was
in for Ballard for a matter of weeks

But thethethe audacity of it protested Mrs Forbes What do you
think she said after you and Dr Ballard had done downstairs I tried to
bring her to a sense of what shed done and all she answered was that
she had known that God would deliver her out of the snare of the fowler
Now I should like to ask you Mr Evringham added Mrs Forbes in an
access of outraged virtue which of us three do you think she called
the fowler

Give it up Im sure returned the broker but I can imagine that we
seemed three pretty determined giants for one small girl to outwit

Shed outwit a regiment sir and I dont see how you can permit it

Mr Evringham endeavored to compose his countenance We must allow her
religious liberty I suppose Mrs Forbes Its a matter of religion
with herthat is we must allow it as long as she keeps well If
Ballard had found her worse tonight I assure you I should have
consigned all Christian Scientists to the bottom of the sea and that
little zealot would have taken her medicine from my own hand Alls well
that ends well eh

Mrs Forbes had caught sight of the incongruous adornment of her
employers desk

With majestic strides she advanced upon the yellow chicken and swept it
into her apron Julia must be taught not to litter your room sir

I beg your pardon returned the broker firmly also advancing and
holding out his hand That is my chicken

Slowly Mrs Forbes restored the confiscated property and Mr Evringham
examined it carefully to see that it was intact and then set it
carefully on his desk

Mrs Forbes recalled the confectioners window She must have bought
that chicken when my back was turned she thought That young one
could have given points to Napoleon



CHAPTER XV

A RAINY MORNING

The next morning it rained so heavily that Mr Evringham was obliged to
forego his ride Wet weather was an unmixed ill to him It not only
made riding and golf miserable but it reminded him that rheumatism was
getting a grip on one of his shoulders

It is disgusting perfectly disgusting to grow old he muttered as he
descended the broad staircase On the lower landing Jewel rose up out
of the dusk where she had been sitting near the beautiful clock Her
bright little face shone up at him like a sunbeam

You didnt expect to see me grandpa did you she asked and as it
did not even occur to him to stoop his head to her she seized his hand
and kissed it as they went on down the stairs

I was so disappointed because it rained so hard I was going to see you
ride

Yes Beastly weather assented Mr Evringham

But the flowers and trees want a drink dont they

M I suppose so

And the brook will be prettier than ever

M See that you keep out of it

Yes I will grandpa and I thought the first thing this morning Ill
wear my rubbers all day I was so afraid I might forget I put them right
on to make sure

They had reached the hall and Jewel exhibited her feet encased in the
roomy storm rubbers

Great Scott child ejaculated Mr Evringham viewing the shiny
overshoes What size are your feet

I dont know returned the little girl but I only have to scuff
some and then theyll stay on Mrs Forbes said Id grow to them

So you will I should think if youre going to wear them in the house
as well as out It was against Mr Evringhams principles to smile
before breakfast at all events at any one except Essex Maid but the
large shiny overshoes that looked like overgrown beetles and Jewels
optimistic determination to make him happy even offset his painful arm

The house doesnt leak anywhere he said I think it will be safe for
you to take them off until after breakfast

Jewel lifted her shoulders and looked up at him with the glance he knew

Unless were going out to the stable she said suggestively

He hesitated a moment Very well he returned Let us go to the
stable

But first we must tie the ribbons she said with a joyous chuckle
She would have skipped but for the rubbers As it was she proceeded
circumspectly to the library drawing the broker by the hand I want
you to see grandpa if you dont think I made my parting real straight
this morning she said as she softly closed the door

Gently on my arm Jewel he remonstrated wincing as she returned
flinging her energetic little body against him I have the rheumatism
like the devilpardon me

She looked at him suddenly wondering and wistful Oh have you she
returned sympathetically But it is only like the devil grandpa she
added hopefully and you know there isnt any devil

I cant discuss theology before breakfast he returned briefly

Dear grandpa you shant have a single pain She held her head back
and looked at him lovingly

Very likely not when Ive begun playing the harp Now where are those
conthose ribbons

Jewels eyes and lips grew suddenly serious and doubtful and he
observed the change

Yes your hair ribbons you know he added hastily and with an attempt
at geniality

Not if you dont like to grandpa

I love to he protested Ive been looking forward to it all the
morning I thought never mind if I cant go riding I can tie Jewels
hair ribbons

The child laughed a little even though her companion did not Oh
grandpa youre such a joker she said just like father

But he saw that she doubted his mood and the toe of one of the
overshoes was boring into the carpet as she stood where she had
withdrawn from him

Let us see if you parted your hair better he said in a different and
gentler tone and instantly the flaxen head was bent before him and
Jewel felt in her pocket for the ribbons He had not the heart to say
what he thought namely that her parting looked as though a saw had
been substituted for a comb

Very well very well he said kindly

When the ribbons were at last tied the two proceeded to the
diningroom Here an open fire of logs furnished the cheerful light that
was lacking outside The morning paper hung over the back of a chair
warming before the blaze

Mrs Forbes entered from the butlers pantry and looked surprised
I didnt expect you down for half an hour yet sir Shall I hurry
breakfast

No Im going to take Jewel to the stable Mr Evringham stopped and
took a few lumps of sugar from the bowl

Julia where are your rubbers asked the housekeeper

On said the child lifting her foot

I only hope theyll stay there remarked her grandfather I think
Mrs Forbes you must buy shoes as Ive heard that Chinamen dothe
largest they can get for the money

He disappeared with his happy little companion and the housekeeper
looked after them disapprovingly

Theyre both going out bareheaded she mused Id like to betI
would bet anything that she asked him to take her He never even stopped
to look at the paper Hes just putty in her hands thats what he is
putty and shes been here three days

Mr Evringhams apprehensions proved to have foundation Halfway to
the barn Jewel stepped in a bit of sticky mud and left one rubber Her
companion did not stop to let her get it but picking her up under his
well arm strode on to the barn where they appeared to the astonished
Zeke

Jewel was laughing in high glee She was used to being caught up in a
strong arm and run with

Mr Evringham shook the drops from his head Get Jewels rubber please
Zeke he said pointing with his thumb over his shoulder

I was Cinderella cried the child gayly Thats my glass slipper out
there in the mud

Zeke would have liked to joke with her but that was an impossibility in
the august presence He cast a curious glance at the little girl as
he left the barn He had received his mothers version of yesterdays
experience Well it looks to me as if there was something
those Christian Science folks know that the rest of us dont he
soliloquized I saw her with my own eyes and felt her with my own
hands Mother says children get up from anything twice as quick as grown
folks but I dont know

Dont you love a stable grandpa exclaimed Jewel Oh Im too happy
to scuff and she kicked off the other rubber Even while she spoke
Essex Maid looked around and whinnied at sight of her master

She knows you she knows you cried the little girl joyously hopping
up and down

Of course said Mr Evringham holding out his hand to the delighted
child and leading her into the stall The mare rubbed her nose against
him We couldnt get out this morning eh girl said the broker
caressing her neck while Jewel smoothed the bright coat as high as she
could reach Her grandfather lifted her in his arms Here my maid
heres a new friend for you In my pocket Jewel

The child took out the lumps of sugar one by one and Essex Maid ate
them from the little hand touching it gently with her velvet lips Zeke
came in and whistled softly as he glanced at the group in the stall

Whew he mused Hes letting her feed the Maid I guess she can put
her shoes in _his_ trunk all right

Mr Evringham set Jewel on the mares back and she smoothed the bright
mane and patted the beautiful creature

Id like to gallop off now over the whole country she said her face
glowing

I shouldnt be surprised either if you could do it bareback returned
Mr Evringham but you must never come into either of the stalls
without me You understand do you

Yes grandpa Im glad you told me though because I guess I should
have The child gave a quick unconscious sigh

Well wed better go in now

How kind you are to me said the child gratefully as she slid off the
horses back with her arms around her grandfathers neck

He had forgotten his rheumatic shoulder for the time

You can bring those rubbers in later he said to Zeke and so carried
Jewel out of the barn through the rain and into the house

Mrs Forbes watched the entrance Breakfast is served sir she said
with dignity She thought her employer should have worn a hat

Jewel was not offered eggs this morning Instead she had after her
fruit and oatmeal a slice of ham and a baked potato

Her roses were fresh this morning and opening in the warmth of the fire
but Mr Evringhams eyes were caught by a mass of American Beauties
which stood in an alcove close to the window

Where did those come from he demanded

They belong to Miss Eloise replied Mrs Forbes She asked me to take
care of them for her

Humph Ballard again I suppose remarked the broker

I hope so responded Mrs Forbes devoutly

Mr Evringham had spoken to himself and he glanced up from his paper
surprised by the prompt fervor of the reply The housekeeper looked
noncommittal but her meaning dawned upon him and he smiled slightly
as he returned to the news of the day

Dr Ballard must love Cousin Eloise very much said Jewel mashing her
potato He sent her a splendid box of candy too

She addressed her remark to Mrs Forbes and in a low tone in order not
to disturb her grandfathers reading

Any girl can get candy and flowers and love if shes only pretty
enough returned Mrs Forbes but she mustnt forget to be pretty

The speakers tone appealed to Jewel as signifying a grievance She
looked up

Why somebody married you Mrs Forbes she said kindly

Mr Evringhams paper hid a face which suddenly contorted but the
housekeepers quickglancing eyes could not see a telltale motion

She gave a hard little laugh You think theres hope for you then do
you she returned

I guess Im not going to be married replied Jewel Father says Im
going to be his bachelor maid when I grow up

Shouldnt wonder if you were said Mrs Forbes dryly

The owner of the American Beauties and the beribboned bonbon box was
taking her coffee as usual in bed This luxurious habit had never been
hers until she came to BelAir but it was her mothers custom and
rather than undergo a teteatete breakfast with her host she had
adopted it

Now she had made her toilet deliberately There was nothing to hurry
for Her mothers voice came in detached sentences and questions from
the next room

Dear me this rain is too trying Eloise Didnt you have some
engagement with Dr Ballard today

He thought he could get off for some golf this afternoon

What a disappointment for the dear fellow feelingly He has so
little time to himself

Eloise gave a most unsympathetic laugh More than he wishes he had I
fancy she returned

She came finally in her white negligee into her mothers room Mrs
Evringham was still in bed Her eyeglasses were on and she regarded her
daughter critically as she came in sight She had begun to look upon her
as mistress of the fine old Ballard place on Mountain Avenue and
the setting was very much to her mind The girl sauntered over to the
window and taking a low seat leaned her head against the woodwork
embowered in the lace curtains

How it does come down said Mrs Evringham fretfully And I lack
just a little of that lace braid or I could finish your yoke I suppose
Forbes would think it was a dreadful thing if I asked her to let Zeke
get it for me

Dont ask anything returned Eloise

When you are in your own home sighed Mrs Evringham

Dont mother Its indecent

If you would only reassure me my child so I wouldnt have to undergo
such moments of anxiety as I do

Oh you have no mercy exclaimed the girl and when she used that tone
her mother usually became tearful She did now

You act as if you werent a perfect treasure Eloiseas if I didnt
consider you a treasure for a prince of the realm

A knock at the door heralded Sarahs arrival for the tray and Mrs
Evringham hastily wiped her eyes

Yes you can take the things she said as the maid approached I
cant tip you as I should Sarah Im going to get you something pretty
the next time I go to New York

Sarah had heard this before

And if you know of any one going to the village this morning I want a
piece of lace braid Have you heard how Miss Julia is

She was down at breakfast maam and Mr Evringham had her out to the
stable to see Essex Maid

He did In the rain How very imprudent

After Sarah had departed with her burden Mrs Evringham took off her
eyeglasses

There Eloise you heard that Its just as I thought He is taking a
fancy to her

The girl smiled without turning her head Oh no that wasnt your
prophecy mother You said she was too plain to have a chance with our
fastidious host

Well didnt she look forlorn last night at the dinner table demanded
Mrs Evringham a challenge in her voice

Indeed she did the poor baby She looked exactly as if she had two
female relatives in the house neither of whom would lift a finger to
help her even though she was just off a sick bed The same relatives
dont know this minute how or where she spent the evening

I felt very glad she was content somewhere away from the drawingroom
returned Mrs Evringham practically You know we expected Dr Ballard
up to the moment the roses arrived and from all I gathered at the
dinner table it would have been awkward enough for him to walk in upon
that child Besides I dont see why you use that tone with me It has
been your own choice to let her paddle her own canoe and youve had an
object lesson now that I hope you wont forget You wouldnt believe me
when I begged you to exert yourself for your grandfather and now you
see even that plain little thing could get on with him just because she
dared take him by storm She has about everything in her disfavor The
child of a common working woman with no beauty and a little crank of
a Christian Scientist into the bargain and yet now see He took her
out to the stable to see Essex Maid I never knew you contradictory and
disagreeable until lately Eloise You even act like a stick with Dr
Ballard just to be perverse Mrs Evringham flounced over in bed with
her back to the white negligee

Eloise had seen what she had been watching for Her grandfather had
driven away to the station so she arose and came over to the foot of
the bed

I know Im irritable mother she said repentantly The idleness and
uselessness of my life have grated on me until I know Im not fit to
live with If I had had any of the training of a society girl I could
bear it better but papa kept my head full of schoolfor which I bless
himand now that the dream of college is hopeless and that the
only profession you wish for me is marriage I dread to wake up in the
mornings

The young voice was unsteady

Mrs Evringham heaved a long sigh Give me patience she murmured
then added mentally It cant be many days and she wont refuse him

Go down to the piano and play yourself goodnatured she returned
Then come up and well go on with that charming story It quite
refreshed me to read of that comingout ball It was so like my own

Eloise her lips set in a sad curve rose and left the room Once in the
hall she paused for a minute Then instead of descending the stairs
she ran noiselessly up the next flight The rain was pelting steadily
on the dome of golden glass through which light fell to the halls She
stole as she had done yesterday to the door of Jewels room

Again as yesterday she heard a voice but this time it was singing The
tones were very sweet surprisingly strong and firm to proceed from lips
which always spoke so gently The door was not quite closed and Eloise
pressed her ear to the crack Thus she could easily hear the words of
Jewels song

 And oer the earths troubled angry sea
 I see Christ walk
 And come to me and tenderly
 Divinely talk

The hymn stopped for a minute and the child appeared to be conversing
with some one

Eloise waited openly eagerly listening hoping the singer would
resume Something in those unexpected words in the sweet child voice
stirred her Presently Jewel sang on

 From tired joy and grief afar
 And nearer Thee
 Father where Thine own children are
 I love to be

The lump that rose in the listeners throat forced a moisture into her
eyes

I never could hear a child sing without crying she said to herself in
excuse as she leaned her forehead on her hand against the jamb of the
door and waited for the strange stir at her heart to quiet

The house was still The rain swept against the panes and tears stole
from under the girls long lashestears for her empty vapid life for
the hopelessness of the future for the humiliations of the present for
the lack of a love that should be without selfinterest

I like that verse Anna Belle said the voice within Lets sing that
again and the hymn welled forth

 From tired joy and grief afar
 And nearer Thee
 Father where Thine own children are
 I love to be

Is there a haven thought the swelling listening heart outside Is
there a place far alike from tired joy and grief

Father where Thine own children are quoted Jewel We know where
a lot of them are dont we Anna Belle and we do love to be with
them A pause and a light sigh which did not reach the listener But
were at grandpas now finished the childs voice

Eloises breaths came long and deep drawn and she stood motionless her
eyes hidden



CHAPTER XVI

THE FIRST LESSON

Jewel looked up as she heard a knock Sarah had made the bed and gone
Who could this be

At her Come in Eloise entered the room The childs face brightened
questioningly She rose and gazed at the enchanted maiden very lovely
in the wrapper of white silk open at the throat and with little
billows of lace cascading down to the toes of her white Turkish
slippers

Goodmorning cousin Eloise said the child waiting for the message
or order which she supposed to be forthcoming

Goodmorning The girl cast a comprehensive glance around the rather
bare room Her eyes bore no traces of the tears so recently shed but
her face was sad I heard you singing she said

Yes Did I disturb anybody asked the child quickly

No It is nice to be like the birds that sing in the rain

Like the robin out there returned Jewel relieved Did you hear
him She ran to the window and threw it open listening a minute No
he has gone

You said you would show me your doll went on Eloise when the window
was closed again

Oh returned Jewel pleased did you come to see Anna Belle Shes
right here We were just going to have the lesson She took the doll
from the depths of a big chair and held her up with motherly pride
Would youwont you sit down a minute

To her great satisfaction her beautiful visitor condescended to take
the chair Anna Belle had vacated and held out her white ringless hands
for the doll

How neatly her clothes are made said the girl examining Anna Belles
garments

Yes my mother made her all new ones when she knew she was going to
Europe so that she would be neat and not mortify me Would you like to
see her clothes eagerly

Yes I should

Jewel brought them her quick little fingers turning them back and
forth exhibiting the tiny buttonholes and buttons and chattering
explanations of their good points

It was a great deal for your mother to do all this when she is such a
busy woman said Eloise

Yes she did it evenings and then surprised me just when we were
coming away Wasnt it lovely

Very

I love prettiness said the child As she spoke she regarded the grave
face beside her When I first noticed that my nose wasnt nice and
neither were my eyes I almost cried

Eloise looked up at her at a loss for a reply

But then I remembered that of course God never made anything that
wasnt perfectly beautiful so I knew that it would come right some
time and I asked mother when she thought it would

What did she say returned Eloise wondering at this original
optimism

She said we could never tell how soon anything would come right to our
sense but so long as we knew that Creation was perfect and beautiful
we could be patient about everythingbig things and little things and
then I remember how she talked to me about being careful never to pity
myself Jewel gave her head a little serious shake You know its very
bad error to pity yourself no matter what kind of a nose you have

Eloise had sunk back in the large chair and was attentively watching
the child standing beside her while she still held Anna Belle She had
never before held converse with a Christian Scientist but her state of
mind precluded the perception of a humorous side to anything

Wrong to pity yourself no matter what happens she asked

Yesbecausebecause Jewel looked off She knew that it was error
but it was hard to explain why to the lovely grownup cousin who was so
strangely sorry Well you see she added after the moments thought
it isnt having faith in God it isnt knowing that youre His child
and that He takes care of you

No I suppose not but I have never learned how to know that Jewel

I know you havent returned the little girl and she slipped her hand
toward her cousins The girl met it halfway and held it close Since
Ive seen you Jewel went on slowly I know that prettiness isnt
enough to make a person happynor all your lovely clothesnor having
people fond of you and sending you presentsnor making the sweetest
music but you can be happy cousin Eloise unless youre doing wrong

I am doing wrong but I cant help it The girl took her supporting
hand from the doll and pressed it to her eyes a second before dropping
it What were you doing when I came in

I was just going to get the lesson

Oh do you go on with your studies Perhaps I can help you better than
Anna Belle

Would you cousin Eloise Jewel flushed with pleasure Some of the
words are so long I thought Id ask grandpa tonight

Why didnt you wish to come to me questioned Eloise well knowing
why

The little girl looked a trifle embarrassed I didnt want to trouble
you Of course you arent my real relations she said modestly

Do you remember that too exclaimed Eloise

Jewel started at the hurt voice Would you like to be she asked
earnestly I wish you were becauseshe hesitated and smiled with her
head a little on the side because I might look more like you

The gravity of Eloises lips remained unbroken I want you to promise
me something Jewel I want you to promise not to tell your grandfather
that I have been with you today

Why Hed be glad I was happy

I have a reason I will help you with your studies every day if you
wont tell him

I might without meaning to rejoined the child her alert little mind
busy with the new problem suddenly presented to it

I will make a rainbow scarf for Anna Belle if you will never speak of
me to your grandfather

Why do you say my grandfather Hes yours too

Not at all Didnt you just say I was not your real relation

Oh but cousin Eloise Jewel was sure of the hurt now though the why
or wherefore was a mystery of course he wishes you were

Oh no he doesnt The answer came quick and sharp and the child
reviewed mentally her own observations of the household Her heart
swelled with the desire to help

Now cousin Eloise her breath came a little faster with the thronging
thoughts for which her vocabulary was insufficient error does try
to cheat people so Just think how kind you were inside all the time
though you wouldnt smile at me Youre willing to make Anna Belle a
scarf I called you the enchanted maiden because you were too sorry
to try to make people happy and now grandpas just like that hes
enchanted too if he doesnt make you happy because hes just as
_kind_ inside oh just as _kind_ as he can be

He likes you returned Eloise

Jewel regarded her for a silent moment I noticed when I came she
said at last apologetically that nobody here seemed to love one
another and the house was so grand and the people were so beautiful
that I couldnt understand and I called it Castle Discord

Eloise gave a little exclamation I call it the icebox she returned

Jewels face lighted Thats it thats all it is she said eagerly
Its easy to melt ice Love melts everything

Its pretty slow work sometimes said Eloise

Then you have to put on more love Thats all Have youthe child
asked the question a little timidly have you put on much love to
grandpa

Why should I love him asked Eloise He doesnt love me

Oh dear said Jewel After a minutes thought her face brightened I
guess Ill show you my dotted letter

She ran to the closet where hung her dotted challie dress and took from
the pocket the message that had come to her the evening of her arrival
My mother put a letter into all my pockets for a happy surprise and
this one came the first night when I was feeling all sorry and alone
and it comforted me Perhaps it will comfort you

She put the paper into the girls hand and Eloise read it She turned
it over and read it a second time

Jewel stood beside her chair watching and seeing that her cousin seemed
interested she ran and brought her little wrapper Perhaps youd like
to see this one too she said feeling in the pocket for the second
message

Eloise accepted and read it Every word of the two notes came to the
mind of the young girl as suggestions from another planet so foreign
were they to any instruction or advice that had ever fallen to her lot

She gave a slight exclamation as she finished Is your mother a saint
she asked looking up suddenly

No returned Jewel innocently Shes a Christian Scientist

Eloise suddenly put out her hand and drawing Jewel to her hid her
forehead on the childs breast

I wish you were older she said

Jewel put her little hands on the shining waves of hair she had admired
from afar I wish my mother was here she answered Did you like
those things mother said

Oh yes but theyre from heaven and Im in the other place replied
Eloise disconsolately

Then lets look in another pocket exclaimed Jewel Ill look in my
best dress Perhaps shed put the best one there

The girl lifted her head and the child went eagerly to the closet
coming back with a folded paper Well read it together You read it
out loud and Ill look over your shoulder

The rain slanted against the window in gusts as the two heads bent above
the paper Eloise read

Mother is thinking of you little daughter every day and every night
and the thing she hopes the most is that you never let the day go
by without studying the lesson The words may be hard sometimes but
perhaps some one will read it with you and if they do not then you go
on trying your best and you will learn more and more all the time for
truth will shine into your thought and help you Grandpa will give
you plenty of bread and butter but you must remember that Spirit
not matter satisfieth You would starve without the Bible and the
textbook and very soon the joy would go out of everything Give my
love to Anna Belle and tell her not to go out to play any day until you
have read the lesson

Your mother speaks as if you learned Christian Science out of the
Bible said Eloise

Of course returned Jewel

I thought a woman got it up said the girl I thought your church
worshipped her

The child smiled at the phrase You know Christ was the first one
Thats why we call ourselves that We couldnt be Christian Scientists
if we worshipped any one but God she answered Of course we love Mrs
Eddy Just think how good and unselfish a person has to be before they
can hear Gods teaching He showed her how to remind people of the
things that Christ taught and how to get rid of their sins and
sickness We love her dearly for helping people so much and shouldnt
you think everybody would But they dont Some people think hating
thoughts about her just as if she was teaching bad things instead of
good ones Mother says it reminds her of what the Saviour said For
which of these works do ye stone me

Ah but you see returned Eloise Christian Scientists let people die
sometimes without a doctor

But lots of people they do cure are the ones doctors said would have to
die

I know they claim that

And such a lot of people pass on while doctors are taking care of them
I wonder why it makes everybody so angry when a Scientist goes without
any

Eloise smiled faintly as she shook her head It is more respectable to
die with a doctor at your side she returned

Are you really willing to help me with the lesson cousin Eloise If
you are it would be nice if you would get your Bible too

The girl looked embarrassed I havent any

Well your mothers would do just as well said Jewel politely

She hasnt anyhere Im sure

The little girl stood very still a moment No wonder theyre sorry
she thought

All right We can both look over one she answered and going to the
dresser she brought her books

Was this the study you meant asked Eloise looking at the three books
curiously I thought I was offering to help you with something I knew
about I used to learn verses out of the Bible when I was a little girl
in Sundayschool I dont know anything about it now

But you can read everything the big words and all replied Jewel I
wish I could

Eloise saw that this reply was designed to minister to her selfrespect
She took up the small black book lying with the Bible What is this

That is Science and Health that Mrs Eddy wrote to explain to us
what the Bible means and this other one is to tell us where to pick out
the places for the days lesson Jewel pulled up a chair and seating
herself turned over the leaves of the Quarterly briskly until she found
the right date

Please find Zechariah cousin Eloise

Whats that asked the girl helplessly

Its in the Old Testament Would you rather Id find them All right
then you can take Science and Health and find that part

I hope its easy for Im awfully stupid Jewel

Oh its very easy Youll see The child found the chapter and verse
in the Bible and read with her finger on the line Eloise looked over
and read with her Thus they went through all the verses for the day
then Jewel began to give the page and line to be read in the textbook

This volume was small and agreeable to handle the India paper pleasant
to the girls dainty touch According to the childs request she read
aloud the lines which were called for

Thats all said Jewel at last Oh cousin Eloise its just lovely
and easy to get the lesson with you she added gratefully

Eloise made no response Her eye had been caught by a statement on the
page before her and she read on in silence

Jewel waited a minute and then seeing that her cousin was absorbed she
laid down the Quarterly and took up her doll and sat still watching the
pretty profile undisturbed by doubts as to what her cousin might think
of the book she held and full of utter confidence that He who healeth
all our diseases would minister to her through its pages

At last Eloise again became conscious of her surroundings She turned to
her companion a skeptical comment on her lips but she suppressed
the words at sight of the innocent expectant face She certainly had
nothing to give this child better than what she already possessed

You can read it any time when you feel sorry cousin Eloise that and
my Bible too Mother always does

Does she ever feel sorry

Sometimes but it cant last where the Bible is

I never saw that the Bible had anything to do with us said Eloise

Whyee Jewel suddenly dropped Anna Belle and again took up the
Bible

What do you think I opened to holding the verse with her finger as
she looked up Then she read If ye love them that love you what thank
have ye Now isnt that something to do with you and grandpa

I dont see how I can love people who dont choose to be lovable
returned Eloise Whats the use of pretending

But then said the child the trouble is that everything that isnt
love is hate

Her visitor raised her eyebrows Ah I should have to think about
that she returned

Yes youd better agreed Jewel Then she turned to the Psalms and
read the ninetyfirst

When she had finished she looked up at her cousin an earnest
questioning in her eyes

That is very beautiful said Eloise I never heard it before How
well you read it Jewel

Yes replied the child Its so much easier to read things when you
know them by heart Then she turned to the Twentythird Psalm and read
it

Yes Ive heard that one Its beautiful of course but I never thought
of its having anything to do with us Eloise was watching her cousin
curiously It seemed too strange for belief that a healthy child of her
age should be taking a vital interest in the Bible and endeavoring to
prove a position from its pages

When the girl finally rose to go she turned at the door

Remember your promise not to tell grandfather about this morning she
said

Jewel hovering about her looked troubled

Would you just as lief tell me why she asked

Eloise gave the ghost of a smile It would be a long story and I
scarcely think you would understand

I think I could obey you better if you would tell me

Very well We my mother and I are not Mr Evringhams real
relationsto put it as you doand we have come here because my poor
father lost his money and we have nowhere else to go We came without
being invited and it hurts to have to stay where we are not wanted I
dont wish grandfather to think that I am being kind to you for fear he
will believe that I am doing it to make him like me better and because I
want to stay here

The girl spoke slowly and with great clearness

Jewel looked at her speechless with surprise and perplexity

Eloise went on I dont want to stay here you understand I wish to go
away I would go today if my mother were willing

Her large eyes grew dark as she closed and the child received a sense
of the turbulence that underlay her words

Thank you for explaining she returned in an awed tone I wish my
mother was here but God is and Hell take care of you cousin Eloise
Mother says we dont ever need to stay in the shadow Theres always the
sunshine only we must do our part we must come into it

How Jewel Supposing you dont know how

You can learn how replied the child earnestly right in those books
Lots of sorry people grow glad studying them



CHAPTER XVII

JEWELS CORRESPONDENCE

While Jewel still stood turning over in her mind what she had heard
charming strains of music began coming up through the hall Cousin
Eloise had gone to the piano

I almost which I hadnt made her tell me thought the child for how
can I help grandpa not to be sorry they are here Wouldnt I be sorry
to have aunt Madge come and live with me when I never asked her to
She stood for some minutes wrestling with the problem but suddenly her
expression changed I was forgetting she exclaimed I mustnt get
sorry too God is All Mortal mind cant do anything about it She
closed her eyes and pressing her hand to her lips stood for a minute
in mute realization then with a smile of relief she took up Anna
Belle

Lets go down dearie and hear the music she said light heartedly

When the summons to luncheon sounded and Mrs Evringham entered the
parlor she found the child curled up in a big chair her doll in her
lap listening absorbedly to the last strains of a Chopin Ballade

Do you like music Julia she asked patronizingly as her daughter
finished and turned about

The childs name is Jewel said Eloise

Yes aunt Madge I love it replied the little girl and I didnt
know people could play the piano the way cousin Eloise does

Mrs Evringham smiled I suppose youve not heard much good music

Yesm Ive heard our organist in church

And Jewel can make good music herself said Eloise She can sing like
a little lark Ive been up in her room this morning

Mrs Evringham welcomed the look on her daughters face as she made the
statement Thank fortune Eloise has played herself into good humor
she thought

Indeed I must hear her sing some time Youre playing unusually well
this morning my dear I wish Dr Ballard could have heard you Come to
luncheon

The three repaired to the diningroom where Mrs Forbess glance
immediately noted the presence of Anna Belle She took her from Jewels
arms and placed her on a remote corner of the sideboard in the middle
of which glowed the American Beauty roses

Mrs Evringham approached them with solicitude

Theyre looking finely Mrs Forbes she said suavely You surely
understand the care of roses She lifted the silver scissors that hung
from her chatelaine and succeeded in severing one of the long stems

Here little girl she added advancing to Eloise you need this in
your white gown to cheer us up this rainy day

The girl shrank and opened her lips to decline but restrained herself
and submitted to have the flower pinned amid her laces

Jewel gazed at her in open admiration The glowing color lent a
wonderful touch to the girls beauty Mrs Evringham laughed low at the
fascinated look in the plain little face and luncheon began

To Jewel it differed much from the ones that had preceded it Mrs
Forbes might hover like a large black cloud aunt Madge might rail
at the weather which cut her off from her afternoon drive but the
mornings experience seemed to have put the child into new relations
with all and Eloise often gave her a friendly glance or smile as the
meal progressed

It was destined to a surprising interruption In the midst of the
discussion of lamb chops and Saratoga chips the door opened and in
walked Dr Ballard The shoulders of his becoming raincoat were spangled
with drops his hat was in his hand a deprecatory smile brightened his
face

Forgive me wont you he said as he advanced to Mrs Evringham and
clasped the outstretched hand which eagerly welcomed him It was my one
leisure half hour today

He brought the freshness of the spring air with him and he went on
around the table shaking hands with the others and finally drew up a
chair beside Jewel

No I cant eat anything he declared in response to the urging of
Mrs Evringham and the housekeeper Cant stay long enough for that

His eyes fastened on the graceful girl opposite him who was trying
to offset her blushes by a direct and nonchalant gaze The rose on her
breast seemed to be scorching her cheeks She knew that her mother was
exulting in the lucky inspiration which had made her set it there

How good of you to come and cheer us exclaimed Mrs Evringham Do
take off your coat and stay for a cosy hour We will have some music

Dont tempt me I have an office hour awaiting me I came principally
to see this little girl

Jewel had leaned back in her chair and was watching his bright face
expectantly

Im glad of it rejoined Mrs Evringham devoutly I distrust these
sudden recoveries Dr Ballard Do make very sure that she hasnt one of
those lingering treacherous fevers Ive heard of such things

Dr Ballards eyes laughed into those of his little neighbor She
doesnt look the part he returned

Jewel gave a glance around the table Will you excuse me she said
politely then she reached up to the doctors ear

Shall I go and get my money she whispered

He shook his head No he replied in a low tone I came to thank you
very much for your note and to tell you that you dont owe me anything
Im not usually a no cure no pay doctor I take the money anyway but
this time Im going to make an exception

Why asked Jewel speaking aloud as long as he did

Well you see you didnt take the medicine That makes a difference
Most people take it

Yees rejoined Jewel rather doubtfully She was not sure of this
logic

So now were perfectly square went on the doctor but dont you fall
ill again He shook his head at her I want us to remain friends

Wed always be friends wouldnt we returned Jewel smiling into his
laughing eyes

When is our golf coming off Miss Eloise he asked looking across the
table again

When the weather permits she responded graciously

I guess thats going to be all right commented Mrs Forbes mentally
Shes as pretty as a painting with that rose on and her mother looks
as contented as a cat with her paw on a mouse She dont mean to play
with that mouse either She wont run any risks Shell take it right
in Youre pretty near done for my young feller and your eyes look
willing I must say

The spring rain proved to be a protracted storm Mr Evringham made his
hours long in the city Eloise came up to Jewels room each morning
and read the lesson with her always reading on to herself after it was
finished She made the child tell her of the circumstances of her recent
illness and cure and listened to Jewels affectionate comments on Dr
Ballards kindness with an inscrutable expression which did not satisfy
the child

You love him dont you asked the little girl

Eloise gave a slight smile If everything that isnt love is hate I
suppose I ought to she returned

Yes indeed agreed Jewel and he has been so kind to you I dont see
how you can help it

The girl sighed Dont grow up Jewel she said It makes lots of
trouble

On the second one of her visits to the childs room she put her hand
on the flaxen head Id like to fix your hair she said Mrs Forbes
doesnt part it nicely

I do it myself returned Jewel but Id be glad to have you

So Eloise washed the thick flaxen locks and dried them Then she parted
and brushed the hair and when it was finally tied Jewel regarded the
reflection of her smooth head with satisfaction

It looks just the way mother makes it she said Im going to write
to mother and father tonight and Im going to tell them how kind you
are to me

That evening in Mr Evringhams library Jewel wrote the letter

Her grandfather after making some extremely uncomplimentary comments
upon the weather had lowered his greenshaded electric light and
established himself beneath it with his book

He looked across at the child who was situated as before at the table
her crossed feet in their springheeled shoes dangling beneath

May I smoke Jewel he asked as he took a cigar from the case He
asked the question humorously but the reply was serious

Oh yes grandpa of course this is your room but you know nobody
likes tobacco naturally except a worm

Mr Evringhams deepset eyes widened Is it possible Well were all
worms

Jewel smiled fondly at him her head a little on one side in its
characteristic attitude

Youre such a joker she returned

If you really dislike smoke said the broker after a minute perhaps
youd better take your letter up to your room

I dont mind it she returned Father used to smoke Its only a
little while since it gave him up

You mean since he gave it up

No When people study Christian Science the error habits that they
have just go away

Indeed Im glad you warned me Mr Evringham blew a delicate ring of
smoke toward the table but Jewel had begun to think of her parents and
her pencil was moving Her grandfather noted the trim appearance of the
bowed head

I dont know but I was cut out for a man milliner after all he mused
complacently Those bows have really a very chic appearance

His book interested him and he soon became absorbed in its pages Jewel
occasionally coming to an orthographic problem looked up and waited but
he did not observe her so she patiently kept silence and resumed her
work At last the letter was finished

She looked again at her grandfather and opened her cramped little hand
with relief The back of her neck was tired with her bending posture
She leaned back in the heavy chair to rest it while she waited The
eyelids grown heavy with her labors wavered and winked The rain
dripped down the panes as if it had fallen into a monotonous habit The
sound was soothing Jewel fell asleep

When finally Mr Evringham glanced at her he smiled Little
thoroughbred he mused shed never disturb me He rose and crossed
to the child There lay the finished letter He took it up with some
anticipation

DEAR MOTHER AND FATHERIt is most time to get a leter from you but I
will not wait to tell you I am happy and well

Grandpa is the kindest man and he has the most Beautiful horse her name
is Essecks made He let me sit on her back and give her Sugar Cosin
Elloees is the prettiest one of all She has things that make her sorry
but she is very kind to me She washed my hare today and she helps me
get the lesson There is a docter here he is lovly He tried to cure me
when I had a claim but Mrs Lewis did Cosin Elloees reads S and H when
we get throo the lesson and I think she will be glad Pretty soon and

Your dear

JEWEL


Mr Evringham had scarcely finished reading this epistle when Jewels
head slipped on the polished woodwork against which she was leaning and
bumped against the side of the chair with a jar which awoke her

Seeing her grandfather standing near she smiled drowsily I fell
asleep didnt I she said and rubbed her eyes then noting the sheet
of paper in Mr Evringhams hand memory returned to her She sat up
with a start

Oh grandpa you havent read my letter she exclaimed with an
accent of dismay which brought the blood to the brokers face He felt a
culprit before the shocked blue eyes

Toto see if it was spelled right you know he said You had me do
it before

Yes I wanted you to then returned the child but it is error to
read peoples letters unless they ask you to isnt it

Yes its confoundedly bad form Jewel I beg your pardon You didnt
mean me to see those sweet things you said about me eh

That was no matter It was cousin Eloises secret She trusted me The
childs eyes filled with tears

The broker cleared his throat No harm done Im sure No harm done
he returned brusquely to cover his discomfiture For the first time he
made an advance toward his granddaughter Come here a minute Jewel
He took her hand and led her to his chair and seating himself
lifted her into his lap The corners of her lips were drawing down
involuntarily and as her head fell against his broad shoulder he took
out his handkerchief and dried her eyes I hope youll forgive me he
said After this I will always wait for your permission Now what is
this about cousin Eloise

Jewel shook her head not trusting herself to speak

You cant tell me

No

Then dont you think perhaps it was a good thing I read your letter
after all if it is something I ought to know

The speaker was not so interested to discover the secrets of his
beautiful guest as to set himself right with this admirer He did not
relish falling from his pedestal

Do you think perhaps Divine Love made you do it grandpa asked the
child tremulously with returning hope

Mr Evringham was quite certain that it had been curiosity but he was
willing to accept a higher sounding hypothesis

Mother explained to me about God making the wrath of man to praise
Him added Jewel after the moments pause If it makes you kind to
cousin Eloise perhaps we can be glad you read it

What is the matter with Eloise asked Mr Evringham

Jewel sat up fixed him with her eyes pressed her lips together and
shook her head

You wont tell me

The head went on firmly shaking

Then let me read the letter again

No grandpa decidedly

He kept one arm around her as he smoothed his mustache Is there
something you think I ought to do

A light seemed to illumine the eyes that the little girl kept fixed on
his but she did not speak

Do you think it discourteous for me to spend my evenings away from
those two They dont want me child

Still she did not speak Mr Evringham was divided between a desire to
shake her and the wish to see the familiar fondness return to her face

You wrote that Eloise thinks I do not want her and her mother here Her
intelligence is of a higher order than I feared Well what can be done
about it Ive been asking myself that for some time How would it do to
settle some money upon them and then say goodby

If you did it with love suggested Jewel

Its my impression that they could dispense with the love under those
circumstances The broker gave a slight smile

The child put an impulsive little hand on his shoulder No indeed
grandpa Nobody can do without love It hurts cousin Eloise because she
isnt your real relation She doesnt know how kind you are inside The
childs lips closed suddenly

She fixed your hair very nicely Mr Evringham viewed the flaxen head
critically Thats one thing in her favor

Shes full of things in her favor returned Jewel warmly Errors
using you grandpa not to love her If we dont love people we cant be
sure anything we do to them is right

Mr Evringham raised one hand and scratched his head slowly regarding
Jewel with what she felt was intended to be a humorous air

Couldnt you give me an easier one he asked

Oh grandpa the flaxen head nestled against his breast and the child
sighed I wish everybody knew how kind you are and the broker patted
her shoulder and enjoyed the clinging pressure of her cheek for it
assured him that again he stood firmly on the pedestal



CHAPTER XVIII

ESSEX MAID

The rain and wind lasted for three days clearing at last on an evening
which proved eventful

Mr Evringham had taken a long ride into the country roundabout and
Jewel had been down at the gate to greet his return He swung her up
into the saddle with him and in triumph she rode to the barn

Mrs Evringham observed this from the window and reported to Eloise

I didnt suppose father would be so indulgent to any living thing as
he is to that child she said rather dejectedly Do you know Eloise
Mrs Forbes says that Jewel spends every evening with him in his study

Indeed Im not surprised He had to take pity on her since we would
not

Mrs Evringham sighed I really believe nobody was ever so exasperating
as you are she returned When Jewel first came if you remember I
wished to welcome herin fact I didbut you refused to be decently
civil Now you speak as if we had made a mistake and that it was my
fault I wish you would let Dr Ballard prescribe for you I dont think
you are well

He does prescribe roses and chocolates and I take them dont I

Yes and after this you can have some golf It will do you good

Today was the third during which Eloise had helped her cousin with
the morning lesson and brushed and braided her hair Jewel had had many
minds about whether to tell Eloise of her escaped secret An intuition
bade her refrain but the sense of dishonesty was more than the
child could bear so that morning during the hair braiding she had
confessed She began thus

I wrote to my father and mother last night how good you were to me

Did you tell them how good you were to me asked the girl so kindly
that the childs heart leaped within her and she more than ever wished
that she had nothing to confess

I wish I could be cousin Eloise I meant to be but error crept in
The girl was learning something of the new phraseology and she smiled
at Jewel in the glass and was surprised to find what troubled eyes met
hers I went to sleep that night waiting for grandpa to be through with
his book and when I waked up he had read my letter

Eloises smile faded Tell me again what you said in it she returned

Jewels lips quivered I said how kind you were and washed my hair
and asked me not to tell grandpa

You put that in Eloise interrupted eagerly

The child took courage from her changed tone Yes I said you didnt
want him to know you were kind to me

The girl smiled slightly and went on with her brushing

He wished he hadnt read it when he saw how sorry I was He asked my
pardon and said he had done bad form I dont know what that is

Its the worst thing that can happen to some people returned Eloise
Good form is said to be the New York conscience

Oh responded Jewel not understanding but too relieved and grateful
that her cousin was not unforgiving to press the matter

Eloise fell into thought Mr Evringham had certainly been more genial
at table conversation had been more general and sustained last evening
than ever before the advent of Jewel and he had not sneered either
Eloise searched her memory for some word or look that might have given
hurt to her selfesteem but she could find none

On this evening Mr Evringham was in unusual spirits at dinner time He
told of the pleasure of Essex Maid at finding herself free of the stable
again and of the gallop he had taken among the hills

The meat course had just been removed when Sarah came in with a troubled
face saying that Zeke wanted to see Mr Evringham Something was the
matter with Essex Maid She seemed very bad

The masters face changed and he moved back from the table The
countenances of the others showed consternation Mrs Forbes turned
pale Had Zeke done anything or left something undone She dropped her
tray and hastened after Mr Evringham Eloise noticed that Jewels
eyes were closed In a minute the child pushed back from the table and
without a word to the others she hurried to the scene of trouble She
met Mrs Forbes rushing to the kitchen for hot water

Go straight into the house Jewel cried the housekeeper with an anger
born of her excitement Dont you go near that barn and get in the
way

The child scarcely hearing her fled on As she entered the barn she
heard her grandfathers voice addressing Zeke who was flinging a saddle
on Dick

Dr Busbyll leave anything when he knows its the Maid He didnt
need to say hurry Zeke was as anxious as his master to get the
veterinary surgeon

Essex Maid had fallen in her stall and was making her misery apparent
tossing her head and rolling her eyes Her masters teeth were set

Grandpa may I try to help came Jewels eager voice

Go away child sternly Youll get hurt

But may I treat her

Do anything brusquely but dont come near

Jewel ran to the back of the barn dropped on the floor and buried her
face in her hands

Five minutes passed ten fifteen Zeke rode up to the barn door white
and wildeyed in the twilight

Dr Busby was away he gasped They tried to get him on the
telephone and at last did Hell be here in a few minutes

The Maids better said Mr Evringham wiping his forehead There
hasnt been a repetition of the attack Mrs Forbes stood by fanning
herself with her apron The mare was standing quietly

Great Scott but Im glad replied Zeke devoutly Ive seen em
keel up with that You can go through me with a fine tooth comb Mr
Evringham and you wont find a thing Ive neglected for that mare
Excitement had placed the young fellow beyond his awe for the master

I believe you boy returned the broker In his relief he would have
believed anything

See the poor kid said Zeke catching sight of the little figure
sitting out of earshot where the twilight touched her

Mr Evringham wheeled and strode back to the child Her face was still
hidden

Dont cry Jewel he said kindly his voice unsteady Shes better

The child looked up radiantly I knew it

The unexpected look and exclamation startled her grandfather Zeke says
the doctor cant get here for a little while he went on but the mare
is out of pain

Its all right rejoined the child joyously The doctor ought not to
come We shall do better without him

The first gleam of her meaning began to shine across the brokers mind
He stared down at the little figure uncertain whether to laugh or cry
sufficiently shaken to do either

Why you midget you he said picking the child up in his arms have
you been trying your tricks over here in the corner

That isnt the way to talk grandpa when God has helped us so
returned Jewel earnestly

Zeke following his employer had heard this colloquy and stared open
mouthed

When Dr Busby arrived he was a much injured man The mares perfectly
fit he grumbled Youve made me leave an important case

Very sorry returned Mr Evringham trying to look so The fact is
the Maid has given us a scare in the last hour that I shouldnt like
repeated Look her over carefully Busby carefully

I have The veterinary gave a cross look around the group his glance
resting a moment on the upturned face of a little flaxenhaired girl who
stood with her hand in Mr Evringhams

Hes falling into his dotage I guess said the doctor privately to
Zeke as he prepared to ride away

Dont fool yourself returned the young fellow The mare pretty near
scared me into a fit My knees aint real steady yet

He stood watching the disappearing figure of the veterinary That kid
believes praying did it he mused I aint going to believe that of
course but the whole thing was the queerest ever

Mr Evringham after one more visit to the stall of Essex Maid started
back to the house Jewel skipping beside him

Mrs Forbes remained in the barn one hand still pressed to her ample
bosom a teakettle in the other

Whatd you calclate to do ma inquired her son approaching her

Wring out hot flannels Its sense to treat colic the same whether
its in a horse or a baby

Zeke laughed Essex Maid didnt think so did she

Wouldnt let us do a thing I saw the tears drip out of Mr Evringhams
eyes plain as I see you now Zeke Forbes youll never know what it was
to me to have you come in and speak the way you did You couldnt have
done it if youd mistreated the horse any way

Thank you returned the coachman emphatically I aint monkeying with
buzz saws this year

Not knowingly you wouldnt But childMrs Forbes set down the
kettle and pressed the other hand tighter to her bosom as she came
closer to him last night youd been drinking when you came home

Ho laughed Zeke uncomfortably just a smile or two with the boys By
ginger youve got a nose on you mother

Can you think of your father and then laugh over it Zeke There hasnt
a man ever come to be a sot that didnt laugh about it in the first
place

Now mother now now said the young fellow in halfimpatient tones
of consolation as he took the handkerchief from her apron pocket and
wiped her eyes where tears began to spring You must trust a chap to
do whats right I aint a fool Dont you think about this again I
can take care of myself Come now to change the subject whats your
opinion of Christian Science as applied to horses with the colic

What do you mean returned the housekeeper in an unusually subdued
tone

Why didnt you catch on The kid was over there in the corner treating
the Maid Thats what they call it treating em Mr Evringham laughed
when he found out and she jumped on him Yes she did came right out
and told him that wasnt the way to show his gratitude or something
like that Think of the nerve

I aint surprised That child cant surprise me

But what do you think of it ma I tell you t was queer the way that
mares pain stopped Of course I aint going to believebut firmly
I cant get away from a notion that those Christian Science folks know
something that we dont Busby was maddern a hornet I didnt scarcely
know what to say to him

Dont be soft Zeke returned his mother picking up the kettle The
time for superstition has gone by

As Jewel and her grandfather entered the house they heard music

Thats cousin Eloise playing Have you heard her grandpa

Yes when they first came

Than you havent sat with them in the evening for a long time
suggested the child

No II didnt wish to monopolize their society I wanted to give Dr
Ballard a chance He is a friend of theirs you know

Yes but I think cousin Eloise would be glad if she thought you liked
her playing Its very beautiful isnt it grandpa

Yes I dare say Then besides Im not at all sure that Mrs Evringham
would permit me to smoke in the drawingroom

But wouldnt it be nice to go in there just a few minutes before you go
to your study I love to hear cousin Eloise play but I like to be with
you grandpa

Mr Evringham was in a yielding state of mind He allowed the pressure
of the childs hand on his to lead him to the drawingroom where his
entrance made a little stir

Dr Ballard was sitting near the piano listening to the music
Everybody rose as the newcomers entered

How are you Ballard Jewel wished to hear her cousins music and so
behold us If we bring a reminder of the stable blame her

Oh father that dear horse is all right Im sure gushed Mrs
Evringham or else you wouldnt be here

What Something the matter with Essex Maid asked Dr Ballard with
concern

Yes Mr Evringham seated himself A sharp attack but short She
was relieved before we could get Busby here The speaker contracted his
eyebrows and looked at the child who was still beside him The mare
had received mental treatments meanwhile he added gravely

Dr Ballard smiled and drawing Jewel to him lifted her upon his knee
Look here he said cant you let anything around here be sick in
peace We doctors shall have to form a union and manage to get you
boycotted

The child smiled back at him her head a little on one side as her
manner was when she was in doubt how to respond

What a blessing exclaimed Mrs Evringham vivaciously Here father
is the best cup of coffee you ever drank if I did make it myself

Many weeks had elapsed since the broker had accepted a cup of coffee
from that fair hand but he rose now to take it with good grace

Is there going to be some cambric tea for this baby inquired Dr
Ballard

You must be hungry Jewel you hadnt finished your dinner said her
grandfather but she protested that she was not

How is Anna Belle asked Dr Ballard Its a long time since I saw
her

Would you like to asked Jewel doubtfully

Whyofcourseif shes still up Dont have her dress on my
account

She doesnt go to bed till I do responded the child I know
shed love to come down In a flash she had bounded to the door and
disappeared

Eloise was still sitting on the piano stool facing the room
Grandfather she said leaning slightly forward in her earnestness
did Jewel really treat Essex Maid

The broker shrugged his shoulders and smiled as he stirred his coffee

I believe she did

And do you think it did the horse any good

Dont be absurd cried her mother laughingly on nettles lest the girl
displease the young doctor

Dont crowd me Eloise dont crowd me responded Mr Evringham Id
rather have something a little more substantial doing for a sick horse
than the prayers of an infant eh Ballard

Ive been reading Jewels Christian Science book a great deal the last
few days said Eloise If its the truth then she helped Essex Maid

Mrs Evringham was dismayed What a very large _if_ my dear she
returned lightly

Shes a bright little girl said Dr Ballard and as he spoke Jewel
came back

She brought her doll straight to him and he took both child and doll on
his lap

Dear fellow thought Mrs Evringham how fond he is of children Id
like to put Eloise in a straitjacket Do play some more dear wont
you she said aloud eager to return to safe ground

Oh yes cousin Eloise added Jewel ardently

If you will sing afterward Will you asked the girl

Can you sing Jewel asked Mr Evringham

No grandpa nothing but the tunes in church

Well he responded half smiling again I dont know that a hymn
would be so out of place tonight

Do play the lovely running thing about spring cousin Eloise begged
the child

The girl turned back to the piano Jewel is so modern that she doesnt
know the Mendelssohn Spring Song she said and forthwith she began
it

Jewels head lay back against Dr Ballards shoulder and her eyes never
swerved from the whiterobed musician

When the player had finished and been thanked the child and the doctor
exchanged a look of appreciation That sounds the way it does in the
Ravine of Happiness said Jewel

Where is that

Where the brook is

Oh Dr Ballard had unpleasant associations with the brook I
understand you are fond of horses he added irrelevantly

Oh yes

Do you want to go driving with me tomorrow morning

Jewels face grew radiant

Oh yes She looked across at her grandfather

I promised to take you driving didnt I Jewel Well the pleasant
weather has come I guess shell go with me tomorrow Ballard

Guess again Mr Evringham retorted the doctor gayly She has
accepted my invitation

Mrs Evringham looked on and wondered What is it about that child that
takes them all she soliloquized She reminds me of that dreadfully
plain Madam whatshername who was so fascinating to everybody at the
French court

Eloise was smiling Now its your turn Jewel she said

The child looked from one to another I never sang for anybody she
returned doubtfully

Yes indeed for Anna Belle Ive heard you said Eloise

Oh she was singing with me

Very well Let her sing with you now

What one

The one I heardFather where Thine own children are I love to be

Oh you mean Oer waiting harpstrings All right and the child
sitting where she was sang the wellloved hymn to a touched audience

Upon my word Jewel said her grandfather when she had finished Your
music isnt all in your soul His eyes were glistening

Those are beautiful words said Dr Ballard I dont remember any
such hymn

Mrs Eddy wrote it returned the child



It wasnt Castle Discord tonight she said later to Anna Belle while
they were going to bed Didnt you notice how much differently people
loved one another



CHAPTER XIX

A MORNING DRIVE

I declare Eloise said Mrs Evringham the next morning it is almost
worth three whole days of storm to have a spell of such heavenly weather
to follow Were sure of several days like this now She was standing
at the open window having shown a surprising energy in rising soon
after breakfast

She glanced over her shoulder at her daughter who was picking up the
garments strewn about the room Now you can live out of doors I hope
and get yourself toned up again Really last evening things were very
comfortable werent they

Yes I thought the lump had begun to be leavened returned the girl

Talk English please said her mother vivaciously Father seemed
quite human and that is all we have ever needed to make things
tolerable here I suppose we reaped the benefit of his relief about the
horse

Its all Jewel said Eloise smiling Thats English isnt it

Jewel Mrs Evringham exclaimed Why youre all daffy about that
child What _is_ the attraction

Thats what Im trying to find out Its time for me to go up now and
braid her hair and read the lesson

Mrs Evringham regarded her daughter Young people are eager for
novelty I know she said and it would seem as if an interest in a
child was an innocent diversion for you at a time when you were growing
morbid but I do think Im the most unlucky woman in the world To think
that the child should have to be a Christian Scientist and that you
should take this perverse interest in her ideas just now I havent
spoken of your remarks about the horse last night but it was in poor
taste to say the least to mention such nonsense before Dr Ballard
and apparently do it so seriously I knew you had been helping Jewel
with lessons but until last evening I didnt suspect that it might all
be on that odious subject Is it Eloise

Yes but it isnt odious I like the fruit of it in her

Youve never shown Dr Ballard your most agreeable side and now if
youre going to parade before him an Episcopalian and a physician an
interest in thisanarchism I shant blame him in the smallest degree
if he gives up all thought of you

Eloise the undemonstrative put an arm around her mother Shant you
really she replied wistfully If I could only hope that

Do you want to give me nervous prostration rejoined Mrs Evringham
sharply Eloise her voice suddenly breaking do you love to torment
me

Indeed I dont poor mother but Ive been so tormented myself and so
desirous not tooh not to do anything ignoble I cant tell you all
Ive endured since She paused her lips unsteady

Since we lost your father dismally Yes I know it Im the most
unlucky woman in the world

Eloises arm tightened about her mother as she went on Since I was
enchanted and thrown into Castle Discord She looked off at the mental
picture of her cousin Mother she turned back suddenly what a
wonderful thing it is if there really is a God

Why Eloise Evringham have you ever doubted it Thats positively
illbred

But One that would be any good to us Jewels mother thinks she knows
such a One and so does the child I wish youd look into this Christian
Science with me You might find it better than getting grandfather to
pay our bills better than marrying me to Dr Ballard

Mrs Evringham raised her eyes to her deity What have I ever done
she ejaculated that I should have a queer child Well I will not
look into it she returned decidedly and if Dr Ballard were not the
broad noble type of man that he is he wouldnt take the trouble to
notice and entertain a child who has treated him as she has It might
touch even you to see the lengths to which he goes to please you I hope
you will at least have the grace to go down with Jewel to the buggy and
see them off

I couldnt in this wrapper replied Eloise releasing the speaker

Of course not so put on a dress before you go up to Jewel

Its too late dear Hell be here by halfpast ten I must have her
ready

Mrs Evringham looked after her daughters retreating figure and then
her lips came together firmly She untied the ribbons of the loose gown
of lace and silk in which she had keyed herself up by degrees to face
the requirements of luncheon and the afternoons diversions and donned
a conventional dress in which she composed herself by the window to
watch for the doctors buggy There was a vista in the park avenue which
afforded a fair look at equipages three minutes before they could reach
Mr Evringhams gateway

From the moment the doctors office hour was over this stanch supporter
set herself to watch that gap As soon as she saw Hectors dappled coat
and easy stride she sprang up and went downstairs and when the shining
buggy paused at the steps and Dr Ballard jumped out she appeared on
the piazza to greet him

What an inspiring morning she said as he removed his hat That
insane girl she thought If he had chanced to be awkward and plain
he would have been just as important to us His good looks are thrown
in and yet she wont behave herself

Glorious indeed he replied heartily Wheres my young lady

Mrs Evringham had plenty of worldly experience and not even her
enemies called her stupid but at this moment there was but one young
lady in the world to her as she believed there was to him

She is upstairs braiding Jewels hair she replied before she realized
her own insanity Then she hastened on coloring under the odd look in
his eyes But you mean Jewel of course She will be down at once Im
sure Its so kind of you to take her

Not at all Shes an original worth cultivating

Mrs Evringham shrugged her shoulders I suppose she must be since you
all say so Eloise gives up a surprising amount of time to her but I
cant judge much from that because Eloise is so unselfish For my part
the childs ideas are so strange and my little girl is still so young
and impressionable I object to having them much together It may seem
very absurd when Jewel is so young

No I saw last evening how interested Miss Eloise already is

Oh hastily she pretends to be and I assure you I object Eloise
has a good mind and I hope you will offer a little antidote now
and then to the stuff she has begun to read A word to the wise Dr
Ballard I need say no more

It was true Mrs Evringham had no need to say more Her ideas and
especially those which related to himself had always been inscribed in
large characters and words of one syllable for her present companion
who was a young man of considerable perception and discrimination

He had not time to reply before Jewel radiant of face appeared in the
doorway where she hesitated her doll in her arms

I brought Anna Belle she said doubtfully but I can leave her under
the stairs if there isnt room

Anna Belle under the stairs on a morning like this And in such a
toilet Talk about error The doctors tone was tragic as he lifted the
happy child into the buggy

Mrs Evringham nodded a reply to their smiling farewells as Hector
sprang forward and she looked after them in some perplexity

Why should he take the trouble she reflected It would have been
such a splendid morning for them to have gone riding if he had this
leisure Of course it must have been just one of his indirect and lovely
ways of trying to please Eloise

Just as she was solacing herself with the latter reflection her
daughter stepped out on the piazza a little black book in her hand

Warm enough to sit out isnt it she remarked

Her mother looked at her critically She had not seen this carefree
look on her childs face since Lawrence died

Why didnt you come out a little sooner

I wasnt presentable How delicious the air is

Yes Let us sit here and finish that novel

All right

What have you there

Mrs Eddys bookScience and Health

Mrs Evringham made a grimace I read part of it once That was enough
for me Think of the price they charge for it too Think of pretending
it is such a good thing for everybody to have and then putting a price
on it that prohibits the average pocketbook Eloises smile annoyed her
mother Werent you with me the day Nat Bonnells mother said so much
about it

How foolish she was not to try it said Eloise Such a hopeless
monotonous invalid

Well some of her friends worked hard enough to induce her to but when
she found out the mercenary side of it she saw at once that it couldnt
be trustworthy

I suppose even Christian Scientists must have a roof and food and
clothes returned Eloise coolly but Ive thought a good deal the last
few days about the criticisms Ive heard on the price of the book The
fuss over that three dollars is certainly very funny when the
average pocketbook goes to the theatre sometimes has flowers for its
entertainments and rejoices to find lace reduced from a dollar and a
quarter to ninetyfive cents a yard for its gowns It eagerly hoards and
spends three dollars for some passing pleasure or effect but winces and
ponders over paying the same sum for a book that will last a lifetime
and which if it is worth anything furnishes the key to every problem
in life

But why isnt it as cheap as the Bible if it is so beneficial

It will be probably when it is generally respected For the present
it wouldnt be wise to cast it about like pearls before swine Eloise
smiled at herself You see Im talking as if I knew it all My wisdom
comes partially from what I have extracted from Jewel and partly from
what is obvious I havent reached the place yet where I am convinced
but this book is wonderfully interesting It came to me in the darkest
hour I have ever known and it hasit has seemed to feed me when I was
starving I dont know how else to put it I cant think of anything
else Mother why havent we a Bible I was ashamed when Jewel asked
me

Mrs Evringham astonished and dismayed by her daughters earnestness
drew herself up We have a Bible certainly What an idea

Where is it eagerly

In the storage warehouse with the other books

Eloises laugh nettled her mother

The prayer books are upstairs on my table What more do you want if you
are going to take an interest in such things I wish you would dear
and embroider an altar cloth while you are here Im sure father would
gladly contribute the materials and feel a pride in it

Oh mother Eloise still smiled you know he never goes to church

But he contributes largely

Well I havent time to embroider altar cloths Shall I get the story

Yes do Well go around the corner out of the wind

Meanwhile Dr Ballards buggy was covering the ground rapidly Through
the avenues of the park sped Hector and joy Dr Ballard allowed Jewel
to drive as long as they remained within its precincts Slipping his
hand through the reins above where she grasped them he held Anna Belle
on his knee Jewel had not suspected the size of the park One could
almost see the watered leaves increase in the sunshine and the birds
were swelling their little throats to the utmost The roses in her
cheeks deepened in her happy excitement She allowed the doctor to do
most of the talking while she kept her eyes on the horses ears Just
once she ventured to turn enough to glance at him

Ive had dreams of driving horses she said

Is this the first time youve done it waking

No the second Father took me once in Washington Park just before
he came away but the horse didnt pull like this She smiled
seraphically

So boy steady said the doctor soothingly and Hector obeyed the
voice

Did you play in the Ravine of Happiness when you were a little boy

Wheres that

Where the brook is

Oh yes Are you planning to take me to that brook and wet my feet
Jewel

Weve gone long past it Dont you know

I think my education has been neglected I dont remember it

We can go returned Jewel suggestively

Very well we will but first I have a couple of visits I must make

The horse was now trotting toward the park gate As they reached it Dr
Ballard returned Anna Belle and took the lines

Jewel gave an unconscious sigh of rapture Trolleys and so on you
know explained Dr Ballard When you come back ten years from now you
shall drive outside too How was Essex Maid this morning

She was all right but grandpa took only a short ride I guess he was a
littlebitafraid

Shes the apple of his eye or he wouldnt have been so nervous over a
trifle last evening remarked the doctor

Well she made a great fuss replied Jewel She fell down in her
stall and everything like that

Did she really

Yes Zeke said his knees were shaking

But she was all right by the time Dr Busby arrived

Yes

Dr Ballard looked at his small companion a quizzical smile curving his
mustache

Ive never thought of taking a partner Jewel but I might consider
a mascot What do you say to sharing my office and being my mascot
Special high chair for Anna Belle be it well understood

The little girl eyed him her head on one side It was her experience
that all men were jokers I dont know what a mascot is she replied

Its something or somebody that brings one good luck

Do you think I could bring you good luck

It looks that way Of course there are certain rules you would have to
observe It wouldnt do for you to talk against materia medica to the
patients in the anteroom

What is an anteroom

The place where my patients wait until I can see them in my office

Jewel lifted her shoulders and smiled I might read them Science and
Health while they waited and then they wouldnt have to go in

Dr Ballards laugh rang heartily along the leafy street Is that your
idea of mascoting a poor young physician he inquired

Jewel laughed in sympathy She didnt quite understand him but she knew
that they were having a very good time

Pretty soon her companion drove in at the gate of an imposing old
residence set back from the street where the trolley ran with an air of
withdrawing from the intrusion of these modern tracks

I thought it wouldnt injure your conscience to wait for me while I
made a couple of professional visits Jewel eh he asked as he jumped
out and fastened Hector to the ring in the hand of a bronze boy I
wont be any longer than I can help and dont you go to hoodooing me
now while Im upstairs The doctor returned to the buggy and took the
black case frowning warningly at the child I have troubles enough
here without that This old lady used to trot me on her knee and she
wants to spend half an hour every morning proving that doctors dont
know anything before shell let me get to business

It must be hard for doctors returned Jewel going to sorry people
all the time and nothing to give them except something on their
tongues

Dr Ballard gave his small companion a quick glance If he secretly
considered her beliefs as too richly absurd to excite aught but
amusement she evidently as honestly compassionated the poverty of ideas
in his learned profession

Well Ill hurry he said and vanished within the house Time would
not have dragged for Jewel had he stayed all the morning To sit in the
shining buggy in close proximity to the dappled gray Hector and with
Anna Belle for a sympathizer caused the minutes to be winged

When the doctor returned a radiant face welcomed him

I thought I should never get away he sighed but you dont look
bored

He untied the horse jumped into the buggy and they were off again
Hector striding along as if to make up for lost time Now only one more
call Jewel and then well get back out of the dust again said the
doctor cheerily

I havent noticed any dust Dr Ballard Im having the most _fun_

Well now Im glad of that Its a great thing to be eight years old
Jewel

Thats what cousin Eloise says She says shed like to be

Indeed How is the enchantingexcuse meI mean the enchanted maiden
this morning

Shes well She ties my bows now so grandpa doesnt have to

Ties your The doctor looked at the speaker mystified

Jewel put her hand up to the small billows of silk behind her ear My
hair bows They were real hard for grandpa to do

Dr Ballard repressed a guffaw and then turned solemn Do you mean to
say that Mr Evringham tied your hair ribbons

Why yes

That settles it Jewel You must go into partnership with me and wave
wands and things Setting Essex Maid on her legs wasnt a patch on
that

Jewel regarded him questioningly a moment and then repeated But it was
real hard for grandpa

I can believe it

And cousin Eloise is the kindest girl Shes like grandpa about that
Her kindness is inside too

Is it indeed You dont know how much I thank you for telling me where
to look for it

Oh she must be kind to _you_ Dr Ballard

Once in a while once in a while he replied cautiously but Jewel
couldnt get a look into his eyes though she tried he was so busily
engaged poking an invisible fly from Hectors side with the point of the
whip If youll find a way to make her kind to me all the time Jewel
then you will be my mascot indeed

All you have to do is to know she is replied the child earnestly
I felt the way you do at first but now Ive found out just because I
stopped being afraid

Ah thats the recipe eh All Ive to do is to stop being afraid

Thats all cried Jewel beaming at his ready comprehension Youll
find out there isnt a thing to be afraid of with Cousin Eloise and
oh Dr Ballard the child smiled at him wistfully shes getting
sosounenchanted

You just waved your wand I suppose and said Presto change
returned the young man

He turned Hector down a side street and drew rein under a large elm
Heres my rheumatic gentleman he added as he jumped from the buggy
and fastened the horse He wont keep me waiting while he abuses
doctors so I shant be quite so long this time The speaker seized his
case and went up a garden path to the house and Jewel with a luxurious
sigh set Anna Belle in the place he had vacated



CHAPTER XX

BY THE BROOKSIDE

Scarcely had she seen the doctor admitted and the house door closed when
an approaching pedestrian caught her eye She recognized him at
once and a little more color stole into her round cheeks while an
unconscious smile touched her lips

The gentleman had observed the doctor enter the house and glanced idly
as he passed to see what child was waiting in the buggy The half shy
look of recognition which he met surprised him Somewhere he had seen
that rosy face Going on his way and searching his memory he had left
the buggy behind when in a flash it came to him how one day that same
shy pleased smile had beamed wistfully upon him in a trolley car

Instantly he turned back and in a minute Jewel saw him standing beside
her He lifted his hat and replaced it as he held out his hand

Weve met before havent we he asked kindly

Jewel shook hands with him much pleased My mother and father have
gone to Europe she said and it seemed as if there wasnt a Scientist
in the whole world until I saw you

Another proof of what I always saythat we should all wear the pin I
didnt know that Dr Ballard had any Science relations

Oh Dr Ballard and I are not relations explained Jewel seriously
I think he wants to marry my cousin Eloise but he hasnt ever said so
and I dont like to ask him Hes the kindest man I just love him and
hes letting me ride around with him while he makes calls

Why thats very nice Im sure returned Mr Reeves smiling broadly
Does he know that youre a Christian Scientist

Oh yes indeed I had a claim and my grandpa called him to help me
so then I told him but he kept on reflecting love just the same

Mr Reeves scented an interesting experience but he would not question
the child Nice fellow Guy Ballard He deserves a better fate than to
bow down to false gods all his days

Yes indeed returned Jewel heartily

But as you say continued Mr Reeves he reflects love and so we
shall hear of his being a successful physician

Yes I want him to be always happy said the child

Who is your grandfather my dear

Mr Evringham

Is it possible Then you arewhose child

My fathers name is Harry

Of course of course Mr Reeves nodded trying to conceal his
surprise And is he a Scientist now

Yes my mother is teaching him to be

Well Im sure Im very glad to hear this Your grandfather is not
unkindly disposed toward Science

My grandfather couldnt be unkind to anything I thought you knew him

Mr Reeves smoothed his mustache vigorously I thought I did he
returned You spoke of your cousin I knew your aunt and cousin were
with Mr Evringham now Well Im glad Im sure that you are so
pleasantly situated You must come to our little hall some Sunday
where we have service you know It will be rather different from your
beautiful churches in Chicago

But Id love to come replied the child eagerly I didnt know there
was one here Ill get grandpa to bring me

Mr Evringham The speaker could feel the tendency of his jaw to drop

Yes or else cousin Eloise She helps me get the lesson every day and
then she takes my book and reads and reads She told me this morning she
read almost all last night

Mr Reeves nodded slowly once or twice Still they come he murmured
meditatively

Would youwould you mind writing down where that hall is asked the
child

Certainly I will Mr Reeves suited the action to the word taking
an envelope from his pocket for the purpose And if I ever see
Mr Evringham therehe said slowly by the way please tell your
grandfather that we met and had this chat

I dont know your name returned the child

Why of course Pardon me Reeves Mr Reeves Can you remember that

The little girl flashed a bright look at him We cant forget she
reminded him

Of course he nodded Exactly Im very likely younger in Science
than you are little one How long have you known about it

Jewel thought Seven years she replied

Her companion gave a laughing exclamation There you see Ive known
for only one year What is your name

Jewel Evringham

Goodbye Jewel till we meet again some Sunday soon I hope

They shook hands and Mr Reeves went smiling on his way

Seven years he reflected Theres the simon pure article She cant
be over nine Ill wager BelAir Park has had its sensations of late
Evringham The high ball the billiard ball and the race track and
now the reputation of being a difficult old martinet Never unkind to
anything Why shes a little feminine Siegfried that precious Jewel
Ballard and the cousin eh Ive heard that rumor

When Dr Ballard returned to the buggy Jewel began loquaciously telling
him of her pleasant experience

And he knows you Mr Reeves does and he said you were a nice fellow
she finished beaming

Very civil of him Im sure returned the doctor as the horse started
I distinctly remember his having a different opinion one night when he
caught me in his favorite cherry tree but I dont yet understand the
levity of his behavior in scraping acquaintance with the young lady I
left unprotected in my buggy

Oh wed met before in a trolley car explained Jewel I wanted to
run right to him when I first saw that he was a Scientist

A what Mr Reeves Oh go way my little mascot Go way

Yes he had on the pinthis one you know Jewel touched the small
gold symbol and Dr Ballard examined it curiously So we smiled at
each other and today hes told me where I can come to church and Im
nearly sure cousin Eloise will go with me

Dr Ballards eyes grew serious as he turned Hectors head toward the
park I can scarcely believe it of Mr Reeves he said

He says you are too nice to bow down to false gods added Jewel shyly

If mine are false to you yours are false to me said the young man
kindly You can understand that cant you Jewel

Yes I can

And we should never quarrel over it should we he went on

Noo returned Jewel scornfully Wed get a pain

But you can see went on the young doctor seriously that the more we
cared for one another the more we should regret such a wide difference
of opinion

I suppose so agreed the child and so wed

You are going back to Chicago after a while and so you understand that
I can better afford to agree to differ with you than I could with some
one who was going to stay hereyour cousin Eloise for instance

The child looked at him in silence She had never seen Dr Ballard wear
this expression

For this reason Jewel I want to ask you if you wont do me the favor
not to talk to your cousin about Christian Science nor ask her to read
your books nor to go to church with you

The childs countenance reflected his seriousness

You can see cant you that if Miss Eloise should become much
interested in that fad it would spoil our pleasure in being together
while it lasted

The word fad was not in Jewels vocabulary but she grasped the doctors
meaning and understood that he was much in earnest She felt very
responsible for the moment and in doubt how to express herself

I feel sort of mixed up Dr Ballard she returned after a minutes
silent perplexity You dont mind cousin Eloise reading the Bible do
you

No

Youre glad if she can be happy instead of sorry arent you

Yes

Jewel looked at him hopefully There wont be anything worse than
that she said

Yes many things worse he responded quickly You might do me that
little favor Jewel I understand you go to her with your lessons as
you call it and your questions

Yes she helps me but she takes my books to her room I dont see how
I can help it Dr Ballard

Well he heaved a quiet sigh perhaps the attack will be shorter if
it is sharp Well hope so

I wouldnt do any harm to you for anything said the child earnestly
but you wait a little while When people come into Christian Science
it makes them twice as nice If you see cousin Eloise get twice as nice
youll be glad wont you

The young man gave an impatient half laugh

Im not grasping he returned She does very well for me as she
is Now he turned again to the child who rejoiced in the recovered
twinkle in his eyes you have my full permission to convert the error
fairy

Hush hush ejaculated Jewel alarmed We mustnt hold that law over
her

Dr Ballard laughed

Convert her I say Let us see what she would be like if she were twice
as nice Shes a very charming woman now your aunt Madge If she were
twice as nicewho knows The fairy might spread wings and float away

They had entered the park and Jewel suddenly noted their surroundings
Were coming to the Ravine of Happiness she said

Thats the way its been looking to me ever since last evening
responded her companion meditatively

The child paid no attention to his words She was watching eagerly for
the bend in the road beside which the gorge lay steepest

There she said at last resting her hand on that of her companion
Obediently the doctor stopped his horse The park was still but for
the bird notes the laughter and babble of the brook far below and the
rustle of the fresh leaves each one a transparency for a sunbeam

The two were silent for a minute Jewels radiant eyes seeking the
pensive ones of her companion

Do you hear she asked softly at last

What he returned

It is cousin Eloises Spring Song



The doctors words and looks remained in Jewels mind after she reached
home that day She mused concerning him while she was taking off Anna
Belles hat and jacket up in her own room

I dont suppose you could understand much what he meant dearie she
said her face very sober from stress of thought but I did If Id
been as big as mother I could have helped him but I knew I was too
little and when people dont understand mother says it is so easy to
make mistakes in what you say to them

Anna Belles silence gave assent and her sweet expression was always
a solace to Jewel who kissed the hard roses in her cheeks repeatedly
before she sat her in the big chair by the window and went down to
lunch Anna Belles forced abstemiousness had ceased to afflict her
At the lunch table she gave a vivacious account of the mornings
diversions and for once Mrs Evringham listened to what she said
a curious expression on her face This lady had expected to endure
annoyance with this child on her grandfathers account but for unkind
fate to cause Jewel to be a hindrance and a marplot in the case of Dr
Ballard was adding insult to injury

The child suddenly catching the expression of Mrs Evringhams eyes as
they rested upon her was startled and ceased talking

Aunt Madge does love me she declared mentally Gods children love
one another every minute every minute

So Mr Reeves told you where you can go to church said Eloise
replying to Jewels last bit of information

Yes andthe little girl was going on eagerly to suggest that her
cousin accompany her when suddenly Dr Ballards eyes seemed looking at
her and repeating their protest

She stopped and ate for a time in silence Mrs Forbes paid little
attention to what was being said She moved about perfunctorily with an
air of preoccupation She had a more serious trouble now than the care
and intrusion of the belongings of Lawrence and Harry Evringham a worry
that for days and nights had not ceased to gnaw at her heart first as a
suspicion and afterward as a certainty

When luncheon was over Eloise in leaving the diningroom put her arm
around Jewels shoulders and together they strolled through the hall
and out upon the piazza

Mrs Evringham looked after them If only that child werent a little
fanatic and Eloise in such an erratic wayward state ready to seize
upon anything novel it would be all very well she mused for Dr
Ballard seems to find Jewel amusing and it might be a point of common
interest As it is if ever I wished any one in Jericho its that
child

Jewel happy in the proximity of her lovely cousin satisfied herself by
a glance that aunt Madge was not following

Eloise looked about over the sunny verdant landscape What a deceitful
world she said It looks so serene and easy to live in So it was
very lovely over at your ravine this morning

Oh Jewel looked up at her with eager eyes Lets go You havent
been there Its only a little way You dont need your hat cousin
Eloise

Summer was in the air The girl was amused at the childs enthusiastic
tone Very well she answered

Jewel drew her on with an embracing arm and they descended the steps
and walked down the path

Suddenly the child stopped Doesnt it seem unkind to go without Anna
Belle she exclaimed

Oh nonsense returned Eloise smiling Youre not going way upstairs
to get her We neednt tell her we went Shes been out driving all the
morning I think its my turn

The child looked happily up into her cousins face I love to see you
laugh cousin Eloise she returned and they strolled on

The park drives were deserted The cousins reached the gorge without
meeting any one Leaning upon the slender fence they gazed down into
the green depths and for a minute listened to the woodland melody

Isnt it just like your Spring Song asked the child at last

It is sweet and comforting and good replied the girl slowly a
faroff look in her eyes

Jewel lifted her shoulders Dont you want to get down there cousin
Eloise she asked her eyes sparkling

Yes replied the girl promptly

Will it hurt your dress added Jewel with a sudden memory of Mrs
Forbes as she looked over her cousins immaculate black and white
costume

I guess not laughed the girl Are you afraid Mrs Forbes will put me
to bed

She bent her lithe figure and was under the wire in a twinkling Jewel
crept gleefully after her but was careful to hold her little skirts
out of harms way as they climbed down the steep bank and at last rested
among the ferns by the brook Its louder babble seemed to welcome them
Nature had been busy at her miracle working since the childs last
visit Without moving she could have gathered a handful of little
blossoms Instead she rolled over and kissed a near clump of violets
You darling darling things she said

Eloise looked up through far boughs to the fleeceflecked sky
Everything worth living for is right here Jewel she said Lets
have a tent and not give any one our address

I think we ought to let Dr Ballard come dont you

Now why did you pick him out returned Eloise plaintively She was
resting her head against her clasped hands as she stretched herself
against the incline of her verdant couch Her companion did not reply at
once and Eloise lazily turned her head to where she could view the eyes
fixed upon her

What are you thinking of Jewel

I was just thinking that if my mother made you a thin green dress that
swept around you all long and narrow youd look like a flower too

The girl smiled back at the sky Thats very nice You can think those
thoughts all you please

That wasnt all though because I was thinking about Dr Ballard
He feels sorry I couldnt tell you about it at lunch because aunt
Madgewell because

Yes returned Eloise quietly It is better for us to be alone

Jewels brow relaxed Yes she said contentedly in the Ravine of
Happiness

Look out though continued the girl in the same quiet tone and
looking back at the sky Look out what you say here It is easy now
to feel that all is harmonious and that discords do not exist I think
even if grandfather appeared I could talk with him peacefully

I have thought about it returned the child and it seems hard to
know what to say but I love you and Dr Ballard both so it will be
sure to come out right He feels sorry if you are beginning to like to
study Christian Science

Really did he speak of that to you I think he might have chosen a man
of his size

Of course he spoke of it when he found out I wanted to ask you to take
me to our church

Where is the church here Eloise abandoned her lazy tone

They have a hall Mr Reeves wrote it down for me Do you really care
cousin Eloise Youve been so kind and helped me but do you really
begin to care

Care Who could help caring if it is true Ive been reading some of
the tales of cures in your magazine If those people tell the truth

Why cousin Eloise The childs shocked eyes recalled the girls
selfcentred thoughts

I beg your pardon dear It was rude to say that Im not ill Jewel
Im so well and strong thatIve sometimes wished I wasnt but life
turned petty and disgusting to me I resented everything It is just as
wonderful and radiant a star of hope to read that there is a sure way
out of my tangle as if I had consumption and was promised a cure of
that I dont yet exactly believe it but I dont disbelieve it All I
know is I want to read read read all the time I was just thinking a
minute ago that if we had the books here it would be perfect This is
the sort of place where it would be easiest to see that only the good
is the real and that the unsubstantiality of everything evil can be
proved

Jewel gave her head a little shake Just think of poor Dr Ballard
being afraid to have you believe that

But who wouldnt be afraid to believe it who wouldnt exclaimed the
girl vehemently

Why Ive always known it cousin Eloise returned the child simply

You dear baby You havent lived long I dont want to climb into a
fools paradise only to fall out with a dull thud

Jewel looked at her grasping as well as she could her meaning I know
Im only a little girl but if you should go to church with me she
said youd see a lot of grownup people who know its true Then we
could go on Wednesday evenings and hear them tell what Christian Science
has done for them

Oh Im sure I shouldnt like that responded Eloise quickly How can
they bear to tell

They dont think its right not to There are lots of other people
besides you that are sorry and need to learn the truth

The rebuke was so innocent and withal so direct that honest Eloise
turned toward Jewel and made an impulsive grasp toward her capturing
nothing but the edge of the childs dress which she held firmly

Youre right Jewel Im a selfish thinskinned creature she
declared

The little girl shook her head Youve got to stop thinking you are
you know she answered You have to know that the error Eloise isnt
you

Thats mortal mind I suppose returned Eloise smiling at the sound
of the phrase

I should think it was Old thing Always trying to cheat us said
Jewel All that you have to do is to remember every minute that Gods
child must be manifested He inherits every good and perfect thing and
has dominion over every belief of everything else

Eloise stared at her in wonder Do you know what youve talking about
you little thing when you use all those long words

Yes Dont you asked the child Oh listen for a bird suddenly
poured a wild strain of melody from the treetop

And just think said Jewel presently in a soft awestruck tone that
some people wear birds sewed on their hats just as if they were glad
something was dead

It _is_ weird agreed Eloise I never liked it Jewel did Dr
Ballard blame you because I am interested in Christian Science

He said he wished I wouldnt talk to you and go to church and
everything

The girl bit a blade of grass and eyed the childs serious face

Well what are you going to do about it

I asked God to show me I wish Dr Ballard would study with you

That is impossible He has spent years learning his science and he
loves it and is proud of it so what next

Very queer things happen sometimes rejoined Jewel doubtfully

But not so queer as that would be returned Eloise

Jewel was pondering This was very delicate ground and she still felt
some awe of her cousin however there was only one thing to consider

Do you love him better than anybody cousin Eloise she asked

A flood of color warmed the girls face but she had to smile

Would that make the difference she asked Mustnt we want the truth
anyway

Jewel heaved a mighty sigh She was thinking of Dr Ballards pensive
eyes I should _think_ so she answered frankly because if you just
study the truth and hold on tight how can things be anything but
happy at last I wish I was more grown up cousin Eloise she added
apologetically

Oh no no answered the girl with a little catch in her throat Ive
had so much of grownup people Jewel Im so grown up myself Just
a little while ago I was a schoolgirl busy and happy all the time I
never even went out anywhere except with father and with Nat when he
was at home from college You dont know Nat but youd like him

Why Is he a Christian Scientist

For answer Eloise laughed low but heartily Nat a Christian Scientist
she mused aloud Not exactly my little cousin

Then should I like him as well as Dr Ballard asked Jewel
incredulously

I dont know Tastes differ

Does he like horses asked the child

He knows everything about a horse and a yacht except how to pay for
them poor boy returned Eloise

Is he poor

Yes he is poor and expensive It is a bad combination it is almost
as bad as being poor and extravagant His mother is a widow and
they havent much but what there was she has insisted on spending on
himthat is all she could spare from the doctors bills

She needs Science then doesnt she

Jewel that would be one thing that would keep me from wanting to be
a Scientist Whats the fun of being one unless everybody else is My
mother for instance

Yes but then youd find out how to help her

Eloise glanced at the child curiously She thought it would be
interesting to peep into Jewels mind and see her estimate of Aunt
Madge

My mother has a great deal to trouble her she said loyally

Yes I know she thinks she has returned the child

Again her response surprised her companion

Ill take you as you are Jewel she said Im glad youre not grown
up Youre fresher from the workshop



CHAPTER XXI

AN EFFORT FOR TRUTH

When Eloise spoke in the ravine of talking with her grandfather it was
because for a few days she had been trying to make up her mind to an
interview with him A fortnight ago she would have felt this to be
impossible but subtle changes had been going on in herself and she
thought in him If her mother would undertake the interview now and
take that stand with Mr Evringham which Eloise felt that selfrespect
demanded the girl would gladly escape it but there was no prospect
of such a thing Mrs Evringham was only too glad to benefit by her
fatherinlaws modified mood to glide along the surface of things
and waitEloise knew it knew it every day in moments when her cheeks
flushed hotfor Dr Ballard to throw the handkerchief

The girl wished to talk with Mr Evringham without her mothers
knowledge and the prospect was a dreaded ordeal She felt that they had
won his contempt and she feared the loss of her own selfcontrol when
she should come to touch upon the sore spots

What would you do Jewel she asked the next morning after they had
read the lesson what would you do if you were afraid of somebody

I wouldnt be returned the child quickly

Well I am Now what am I going to do about it

Anna Belle who always gave unwinking attention to the lesson was in
Jewels lap and the child twisted out the inturning morocco foot as
she spoke

Why Id know that one thought of God couldnt be afraid of another
she replied in the conclusive tone to which Eloise could never grow
accustomed

Oh Jewel child the girl said impatiently wed be sorry to think
most of the people we know are thoughts of God

Thats because you get the error man mixed up with the real one Mother
explains that to me when we ride in cable cars and places where we see
error people with sorry faces Theres a real man a real thought of
God behind every one of them and when you remember to think right
about people every minute you are doing them good Did you say youre
afraid of somebody

Yes and that somebody is a man whom I must talk to

Then begin right away to know every minute that the real man isnt
anybody to be afraid of for God made him and God has only loving
thoughts and of course you must be loving all the time Itll be just
as _easy_ by the time you come to it cousin Eloise

The girl often asked herself in these days why she should begin to
feel unreasonably hopeful and lighter hearted Her mother no longer
complained of her moods Mrs Evringham laid the becoming change in her
daughters expression to the girls happiness in discovering that she
did reciprocate Dr Ballards evident sentiments

Eloise is so high minded thought the mother complacently She
would never be satisfied to marry for convenience like so many and
considering herself passingly astute she let well enough alone ceased
to bring the physicians name into every conversation and bided her
time

One morning Mr Evringham coming out of the house to go to town met
Eloise on the piazza

You are down early he said as he greeted her and was passing on to
the carriage

Just one minute grandfather she exclaimed and how her heart beat
He turned his erect form in some surprise and his cold eyes met the
girlish ones

Shes a stunning creature he thought as the sunlight bathed her
young beauty but his face was impenetrable and Eloise nerved herself

Were you thinking of going golfing this afternoon she asked

Yes

I thought you said something about it at dinner last evening Would you
let me go with you

Mr Evringham much astonished raised his eyebrows and took off the hat
which he had replaced

Such a request from youth and beauty is a command he returned with a
slight bow

Tears sprang to the girls eyes Dont make fun of me grandfather
she exclaimed impulsively

Not for worlds he returned You will do the laughing when you see me
drive My hand seems to have lost its cunning this spring Shall we say
fourthirty Very well Goodmorning

Now whats all this mused Mr Evringham as he drove to the station
Has another granddaughter fallen in love with me Methinks not What is
she after Does she want to get away from Ballard Methinks not again
Shes going to ask me for something probably Egad if she does I think
Ill turn her over to Jewel

Eloises eyes were bright during the lesson that morning

Its today Jewel she said that Im going to talk with that man
Im afraid of

Never say that again returned the child vehemently You are not
afraid Theres no one to be afraid of Do you want me to handle it for
you

What do you mean Jewel

To declare the truth for you

Do you mean give me a treatment for it

Yes

Oh Do you know that seems very funny to me Jewel

It seems funny to me that you are afraid when God made you and the
man and all of us and theres nothing but goodness and love in the
universe Fear is the belief of evil Do you want to believe evil

No I hate to returned Eloise promptly

Then you go away cousin Eloise and I will handle the case for you



Oh are you going golfing said Mrs Evringham that afternoon to her
daughter Do put on your white duck dear

Yes I intend to Im going with grandfather

You are in extremest surprise Oh wear your dark skirt dear its
plenty good enough Do you mean to say he asked you Eloise

No I asked him

Mrs Evringham stood in silent amaze her brain working alertly She
even watched her daughter don the immaculate white golf suit and made
no further protest

What was in the girls mind When finally from her window she saw the
two enter the brougham Mr Evringham carrying his granddaughters
clubs she smiled a knowing smile and nodded her head

I do believe Ive wronged Eloise she thought How foolish it was to
worry Ive been wondering how in the world I was going to get father to
give her a wedding and how I was going to get her to accept it and
now look That child has thought of the same thing and will manage it a
hundred times better than I could

Jewel stood on the steps and waved her hand as the brougham rolled away
Eloise had seized and squeezed her surreptitiously in the hall before
they came out

I do feel braced up Jewel Thank you she whispered hurriedly

Is the man over at the golf links asked the child surprised to see
that Eloise and her grandfather were going out together

He will be by the time I get there returned the girl

As soon as the carriage door had closed and they had started Eloise
spoke You must think it very strange that I asked this of you
grandfather

There was a hint of violets clinging to the fresh white garments that
brushed Mr Evringhams knee

I would not question the gifts the gods provide he returned

She seemed able to rise above the fear of his sarcasms Not that
you would be surprised at anything mother or I might ask of you she
continued bravely but I have suffered Im sure as much as you have
during the last two months

Indeed I regret to hear that

If there was a sting in this reply Eloise refused to recognize it

In fact I have felt so much that it has made it impossible hitherto to
say anything but Jewel has given me courage

Mr Evringham smoothed his mustache She has plenty to spare he
returned

She says went on Eloise that everything that isnt love is hate
and hate of course in her category is unreal It is because I want the
real things because I long for real things for truth that I asked to
have this talk grandfather and I wanted to be quite alone with you so
I thought of this way

Its the mater shes running away from then reflected her companion
He nodded courteously I am at your disposal he returned

Subtly the brokers feeling toward Eloise had been changing since the
evening in which Jewel wrote to her parents His hard and fast opinion
of her had been slightly shaken The frankness of her remarks on
Christian Science in the presence of Dr Ballard the other evening had
been a surprise to him The cold proud noncommittal easeloving girl
who in his opinion had decided to marry the young doctor was either less
designing than he had believed or else wonderfully certain of her own
power to hold him He found himself regarding her with new interest

Ive been waiting for mother to talk with you she went on and clear
up our position but she does not and so I must The speakers hands
were tightly clasped in her lap I wish I had Jewels unconsciousness
her certainty that all is Good for I feelI feel shame before you
grandfather

It seemed to Mr Evringham that Jewels eyes were appealing to him

She says he returned with a rather grim smile Jewel avers that I am
kindness itself inside Let us admit it for convenience now and see if
you cant speak freely

Thank you You know what I am ashamed of staying here so long
imposing upon you taking everything for granted when we have no right
I want to understand our affairs to know if we have anything and what
it is to have you help me _you_ to have you tell me how we can
live independently and help me to make mother agree to it Oh if you
wouldif you _could_ be my friend grandfather I need you so

Mr Evringham received this impetuous outburst without change of
countenance How about Ballard he said I thought he was going to
settle all this

There was silence in the brougham The flash of hurt in the girls eyes
was quenched by quick tears Her companion reddened under the look of
surprise she bent upon him her lovely lips unsteady

No offense he added hastily Ballards sentiments are evident
enough and he is a fine fellow

Eloise controlled herself Will you take the trouble to explain our
affairs to me she asked

Certainly responded Mr Evringham quickly I wish for your sake
there was more to explain more possibilities in the case

We have nothing exclaimed the girl acutely

Your father took heavy chances and lost His affairs are nearly
settled and what there is left is small indeed The speaker cast a
quick glance at the girl beside him She had caught her lip between
her teeth Jewels soft voice sounded in his ears Cousin Eloise feels
sorry because she isnt your real relation An inkling of what the girl
might suffer came to him

Your mother and you have a claim upon me he went on I should
certainly feel a responsibility of all my sons debts and the one to
his wife and daughter in particular I will try to make the situation
easier for you in some way

Manage for us to go away grandfather Havent you a little house
somewhere

The beseeching in her tone surprised Mr Evringham still more What did
the girl mean Didnt she intend to marry Ballard He had believed her
to be planning to preside in the Mountain Avenue mansion

Yes it can be arranged certainly he answered vaguely but theres
no hurry Eloise he added in the kindest tone he had ever used toward
her Some evening we will go over the affairs and I will show you
where your mother stands financially and we will try to make some plan
that shall be satisfactory

Eloise gave him a grateful look as much in response to his manner as to
his words Thank you The present condition is certainlyerror she
said

Well well try to find harmony replied the other Jewel would say
it was easy I should like to have you remain at my house at least as
long as she does Eloise I should probably have to tie her hair ribbons
again if you went

The two found themselves smiling at each other The atmosphere was
lightened and the brougham drew up at the clubhouse

Mr Evringham handed out the girl gave Zeke the order to return for
them and they went up the steps

I would drive back with him grandfather only that mother would
wonder and ask questions said Eloise Dont let me detain you in any
way Ill just sit here on the piazza

Not play Nonsense returned Mr Evringham brusquely

Please dont feel obligedEloise began humbly

But I cant help being obliged if youll play with me interrupted her
companion

Some men observed the confidential attitude of the broker and the
beautiful girl Whats doing over there asked one Is Evringham
beginning to take notice

Why dont you know returned the other Thats his granddaughter

His daughter do you mean Didnt know he had one

Not a bit of it Shes Lawrences stepdaughter

The other shook his head Thats too involved for me Shes a queen
anyway

Going to marry Ballard they say

That so Then I wont go up and fall on Evringhams neck My bank book
isnt in Ballards class She can play too as he observed Eloise
make a drive while she waited the reappearance of her companion from
the clubhouse Isnt that a birdand say theres young Lochinvar
himself for here a light automobile whizzed briskly up to the
clubhouse

Dr Ballard sprang out for he had recognized the figure at the first
teeing ground

You gave me the slip he cried as he approached

Oh I just went with a handsomer man returned Eloise smiling as
they shook hands

I didnt know I could come until the last minute then I went to the
house for you and found I had missed you

Mr Evringham and the caddy approached I cut you out for once
Ballard he said Well were off Eloise I saw you drive I doubt if
he catches us



Jewels eyes questioned Eloise that evening when she reached home
and she received the smiling significant nod her cousin gave her with
satisfaction

It was an apparently united family party that gathered about the
dinner table Mr Evringham and Eloise discussed their game while Mrs
Evringham fairly rustled with complacence

As Jewel clung to her grandfathers neck that evening in bidding him
goodnight she whispered

How happy we all are

Are we really Well now thats very gratifying Im sure Goodnight
Jewel



CHAPTER XXII

IN THE HARNESS ROOM

Mother can I have three dollars asked Eloise the next morning

Were you thinking of a new riding hat dear I do wish you had it to
wear this afternoon Yours is shabby certainly but you cant get it
for that child

No I was thinking of a copy of Science and Health I dont like to
take Jewels any longer and Im convinced

What ofsin asked Mrs Evringham in dismay

No just the oppositethat there neednt be any The book teaches the
truth I know it

Well whether it does or doesnt you havent any three dollars to
spend for a book Eloise was the firm reply The _idea_ when I can
barely rake and scrape enough together to keep us presentable

Where do you get our money asked the girl

Father gives me a check every fortnight Of course you know that he has
charge of our affairs

Eloises serene expression did not change She looked at the little
black book in her hand This edition costs five dollars she said

Scandalous exclaimed Mrs Evringham I can tell you this is no time
for us to be collecting _editions de luxe_ Wait till youre married

Im going to run in town for a while this morning mother

You are Well dont get belated You know that you are to ride with Dr
Ballard at half past four Dear me her brow drawn you ought to have
that hat Now I think that I _could_ get on without that jet bolero

Eloise laughed softly and drew her mother to her Have your jet bolero
dear she answered My hat isnt bad

Eloise went to her room and closing the door took from one of her
drawers a box It contained her girlish treasures the ornaments and
jewels her father had given her from time to time She took out a small
diamond ring and pressed it to her lips

Dear papa I love it because you gave it to me but I can get with it a
wonderful thing a truth which if we had known it would have saved you
all those torturing hours would have saved your dear life I know how
gladly you would have me get it now for you are learning it too and it
will be your gift dear _dear_ papa your gift just the same

Jewel had to study the lesson with only Anna Belles assistance that
morning but she received the third letter from her mother and father
Their trip was proving a success from the standpoints of both business
and pleasure but their chief longing was to get back to their little
girl

It was very like visiting with them to read it over and Jewel did so
more than once Ill show it to cousin Eloise as soon as she comes
home she reflected Then she dressed Anna Belle to go out

Running downstairs the child sought and found Mrs Forbes in the
kitchen The housekeeper no longer questioned her going and coming
although she still considered herself in the light of the childs only
disciplinarian and was vigilant to watch for errors of omission and
commission and quick to correct them

Mrs Forbes may I have an old kitchen knife

Certainly not Youll cut yourself

I want it to dig up plants

Mrs Forbes stared down at her Why you mustnt do any such thing

I mean wild flowers for a garden that Anna Belle and I are going to
make

Oh Ill see if I cant find you a trowel

There was one at hand and as the housekeeper passed it to the child she
warned her

Be careful you dont make a mistake now and get hold of anybodys
plants What did your cousin Eloise go to New York for

I dont know

Well I hope its for her trousseau

Jewel smiled My mother makes those

I dont believe shell ever make one for you then returned Mrs
Forbes but not illnaturedly She laughed glancing at Sarah who stood
by

But I think she will for Anna Belle returned Jewel brightly when
she gets older

The housekeeper and maid both laughed Run along said Mrs Forbes
and dont you be late for lunch

Shes an awful sweet child said Sarah half reproachfully Just the
spirit of sunshine

Oh well theyd turn her head here if it wasnt for me answered the
other complacently

Jewel was not late to lunch but eating it teteatete with aunt Madge
was not to her taste

Mrs Evringham utilized the opportunity to admonish her and Mrs Forbes
for once sympathized with the widows sentiments

Aunt Madge took off her eyeglasses in a way she had when she wished to
be particularly impressive

Jewel she said I dont think any one has told you that it is
impolite to Dr Ballard to say anything about Christian Science in his
presence

Why is it asked the child

Because he is a learned physician and has of course a great respect
for his profession

I have a great respect for him returned the child and he knows I
wouldnt hurt his feelings

The idea exclaimed Mrs Evringham looking down from a height upon
the flaxen head As if a little ignorant girl could hurt the feelings
of a man like Dr Ballard

Mrs Forbes also stared at the child and she winced

I do love them and they do love me she thought I dont remember
ever speaking about it before the doctor unless somebody asked me she
said aloud

Your cousin Eloise may ask you returned Mrs Evringham Nobody else
would She does it in a spirit of mischief perhaps but I shall speak
to her She has a passing curiosity about your ideas because it is odd
and rather amusing to find a child who has such unnatural and precocious
fancies and she tries to draw you out but it will not last with her
Neither will it with you probably You seem to be a sensible little
girl in many ways Mrs Evringham made the addition magnanimously She
really was too much at peace with all the world just now to like to be
severe

Outwardly Jewel was silent Inwardly she was declaring many things which
would have surprised her companions

Does your cousin Eloise pretend to you that she is becoming seriously
interested in your faith pursued Mrs Evringham

She will tell you all about it returned Jewel

Aunt Madge shrugged her shoulders and laughed a little Her thoughts
reverted to her daughters trip to the city She had wondered
several times if it had any pleasant connection with her sudden good
understanding with Mr Evringham

To Jewels relief her thoughts remained preoccupied during the remainder
of the meal and as soon as the child could leave she flew to the
closet under the stairs where Anna Belle often went into retreat during
the luncheon hour and from thence back to the garden she was making by
the brookside

When she returned to the house her eyes lighted as she saw two horses
before the piazza and Dr Ballard standing beside one of them

How are you Jewel he asked as she danced up to him smiling
Stooping he lifted her into the side saddle from whence she beamed
upon him

Oh what fun youre going to have she cried

Id like to be sure of that he answered his gloved hand on the
pommel

What do you mean incredulously You dont like that automobile
better do you Theyre soso stubby I must have a horse a horse
She smoothed and patted her steed lovingly

You ought to haveJewel of the world he said kindly My bad angel
he added looking up quizzically into her eyes and smiling at the
widening wonder that grew in them

Yourwhat she asked and then Eloise came out in her habit

Im going instead of you cried the child gayly to pay you for
staying away all day

Did you miss me asked the girl as she shook hands with her escort

I tried not to Anna Belle and I have something to show you in the
ravine As she spoke Jewel slid down into the doctors arms and stood
on the steps watching while he put Eloise up and mounted himself

The childs eyes dwelt upon the pair admiringly as they waved their
hands to her and rode away Little she knew how their hearts were
beating Mrs Evringham watching from an upper window suspected it
She felt that this afternoon would end all suspense

The child gave a wistful sigh as the horses disappeared and jumping off
the piazza she wandered around the house toward the stable There had
been no rules laid down to her since the night of Essex Maids attack
and Zeke was always a congenial companion

As she neared the barn a young fellow left it laughing She knew who
he wasone of the young men Zeke had known in Boston He had several
times of late come to call on his old chum for he was out of work

As he left the barn he saw the child and slouched off to one side
avoiding her but she scarcely noticed him congratulating herself that
Zeke would be alone and ready as usual to crack jokes and stories

The coachman was not in sight as she entered but she knew she would
find him in the harness room Its door stood ajar and as the
child approached she heard a strange sound as of some one weeping
suppressedly Sturdily resisting the sudden fear that swept to her
heart she pushed open the door

There stood Mrs Forbes leaning against a wooden support her forehead
resting against her clasped hands in a hopeless posture as she sobbed
heavily The air was filled with an odor which had for Jewel sickening
associations The only terror the only tragedy of her short life was
wrapped about with this pungent smell She seemed again to hear her
mothers sobs to feel once more that sensation of all things coming to
ruin which descended upon her at the unprecedented sight and sound of
her strong mothers emotion

All at once she perceived Zeke sitting on a low chair his arms hanging
across his knees and his head fallen

The child turned very pale Her doll slid unnoticed to the floor as she
pressed her little hands to her eyes

Father Mother God she murmured in gasps Thou art all power We
are thy children Error has no power over us Help us to waken from this
lie

Running up to the housekeeper she clasped her arms about her convulsed
form Dear Mrs Forbes she said her soft voice trembling at first
but growing firm I know this claim but it can be healed It seems
very terrible but its nothing We know it we must know it

The woman lifted her head and looked down with swollen eyes upon the
child She saw her go unhesitatingly across to Zeke and kneel beside
him

Dont be discouraged Zeke she said lovingly I know how it seems
but my father had it and he was healed You will be healed

The coachman lifted his rumpled head and stared at her with bloodshot
eyes

Great fuss bout nothing he said sullenly Mother always fussing

Something in his look made the child shudder Resisting the sudden
repugnance to one who had always shown her kindness she impulsively
took his big hand in both her little ones Zeke what is error saying
to you she demanded You cant look at me without love I love you
because God does He is lifting us out of this error belief

The young fellow returned the clasp of the soft hands and winked his
eyes like one who is waking Mother makes great fuss he grumbled
Scott was here We had two or three little friendly drinks Ma had to
come in and blubber

What friendly drinks What do you mean demanded Jewel looking all
about her Her eyes fell upon a large black bottle She dropped the
coachmans hand and picked it up She smelled of it her eyes dilated
and she began to tremble again and throwing the whiskey from her she
buried her face for a moment against Zekes shirt sleeve

Is it in a bottle she exclaimed at last in a hushed voice drawing
back and regarding the coachman with such a white and horrified
countenance that it frightened the clouds from his brain Is that
terrible claim in a bottle and do people drink it out she asked
slowly and in an awestruck tone

Its no harm began Zeke

No harm when your mother is crying when your face is full of error
and your eyes were hating No harm when my mother cried and all our
gladness was gone Would you go and drink a claim like that out of a
bottleof your own accord

Zeke wriggled under the blue eyes and the unnatural rigidity of the
childs face

No Jewel he wouldnt groaned Mrs Forbes suddenly Zekes a good
boy but hes inherited that His father died of it Its a disease
child I thought my boy would escape but he hasnt Its the end
cried the wretched woman What will Mr Evringham say To think how I
blamed Fanshaw Zekell lose his place and go downhill and I shall die
of shame and despair Her sobs again shook her from head to foot

Jewel continued to look at Zeke A new eager expression stole over her
face _Is_ it the end she asked Dont you believe in God

I suppose so answered the coachman sullenly I know Im a man too
I can control myself

No Nobody can Even Jesus said Of myself I can do nothing Only God
can help you If you can drink that nasty smelling stuff and get all
red and rumply and sorry then you need God the worst of anybody in
BelAir You look better now Its just like a dream the way you lifted
up your face to me when I came in and it _was_ a dream Ill help you
Zeke Ill show you how to find help The child suddenly leaned toward
the young fellow and then retreated I cant stand your breath she
exclaimed and I like to get close to the people I love

This seemed to touch Zeke He blushed hotly Its a darned shame kid
he returned sheepishly

Mrs Forbes come here please said Jewel The housekeeper had ceased
crying and was watching the pair She saw that her boys senses were
clearer She approached obediently and when the child took her hand her
own closed tightly upon the little fingers

Zeke youre a big strong man and everybody likes you said Jewel
earnestly Isnt it better to stay that way than to drink out of a
bottle no matter _how_ much you like it

I dont like it so awfully returned Zeke protestingly I like to be
sociable with the boys thats all

What a way to be sociable gasped the child Well wouldnt you
rather be nice so people will like to get close to you

Depends on the folks returned the boy with a touch of his usual
manner Youre all right little kid He put out his hand but quickly
withdrew it

Jewel seized it Now give your other one to your mother There now
were all together If your mother thinks you have a disease Zeke then
she must know you havent If you want me to Ill come out here every
day at a quiet time and give you a treatment and well talk all about
Christian Science and well know that theres nothing that can make us
sick or unhappyor unkind Think of your unkindness to your motherand
to me if you go on for I love you Zeke Now _may_ I help you

The soft frank voice the earnest little face moved Zeke to cast a
glance at his mothers swollen eyes They were bent upon Jewel

Do you say your father was cured that way child asked Mrs Forbes

Yes Oh yes and hes so happy

Zeke lets all be thankful if theres _anything_ said the woman
tremulously turning to him appealingly

Id just as soon have a visit from you every day little kid said the
young fellow Youre a corker

But you must want more than me returned the child God and healing
and purity and goodness If youre in earnest what are you going to do
with that She touched the black bottle with the toe of her shoe

Zeke looked at the whiskey then back into her eyes They were full of
love and faith for him

He stooped and picked up the bottle then striding to a window he flung
it out toward the forest trees with all the force of his strong arm

Damn the stuff he said

Mrs Forbes felt herself tremble from head to foot She bit her lip

Her son turned back Getting near train time he added not looking at
his companions Guess Ill go upstairs

When he had disappeared his mother stooped slowly and kissed Jewel
Forgive me she said tremulously

What for asked the child

Everything

The housekeeper still stood in the harness room after Jewel had gone
away She bowed her head on her folded hands Our Father who art in
heaven forgive me she prayed Forgive me for being a fool Forgive
me for not recognizing Thine angel whom Thou hast sent Amen



CHAPTER XXIII

MRS EVRINGHAMS CALLER

Mrs Evringham was busily chewing the cud of sweet fancies only that
afternoon Following the equestrians in their leafy woodland path she
pictured them as talking of their future and herself built many
castles in the air Ah she thought sentimentally leaning back in her
reclining chair how charming is youthwith plenty of money

She was roused from these luxurious meditations by the appearance of
Sarah bearing a card on a salver

A man she exclaimed with annoyance Im not dressed

Lifting the card she read it with a start

Mr Nathan Wycliffe Bonnell

Tell him Ill be down soon was all she said but her thoughts ran
swiftly as she hurriedly slipped into her gown How in the world comes
the boy out here Just as well that Eloise is away It would only be
painful to her all the old associations But old associations cropped
up more and more enticingly for Mrs Evringham as she made her swift
toilet and by the time she reached the drawingroom her eagerness lent
her cordiality a very genuine tone

Nat dear boy how are you

The young man who rose eagerly to meet her would have been noticeable
in any crowd She gazed up into his smoothshaven frank face with its
alert eyes and strong chin and felt a yearning affection for all which
he represented to her What are you doing out here

Visiting you and Eloise he answered with the hearty relish which
always characterized his manner when circumstances were agreeable
Where is she

Riding I dont know when they will come home either Its such a
charming day isnt it So good of you to hunt us up Nat Weve been
out of the world so long I cant tell you what a rush of memories comes
over me at sight of you you nice big boy I do believe youve been
growing She gave a glance of approval at the young mans stalwart
proportions

Oh dont humiliate me he laughed as she drew him to a divan where
they seated themselves

How could you get away at this hour

Im changing my business and get a weeks vacation thereby Great
luck isnt it

I hope so Are you going to do better

Much better Its only a little matter of time now Mrs
Evringhamautomobiles steam yachts and all the rest of it

Ah the optimism of youth she sighed gazing at the dancing lights in
his eyes Its very beautiful and usually entirely unfounded You
look so radiant my dear Perhaps you have come out here to let us
congratulate you Have you found that desirable girl I certainly should
be the first to be told for I always talked to you very plainly didnt
I

Indeed you did Mrs Evringham You always kept my ineligibility before
me strenuously

A certain _sort_ of ineligibility dear boy returned the lady with
a flattering cadence Your capital did not happen to consist of money
Tell me all Nat Who is she

He shook his head Shes still not impossible but improbable he
returned

Oh you are too difficult my dear Really I thought at the time our
misfortunes fell upon us that it was going to be Miss Caton She would
have been a great assistance to you Nat It isnt as if you could even
afford to be a bachelor In these days so much is expected of them How
is your mother Mrs Evringham made the addition in that tone of
fixed sympathy which one employs when only a depressing answer can be
expected

Very well thank you

You mean as well as usual I suppose

No I mean well Wonderful isnt it

Really Nat Mrs Evringham straightened up in her interest Who did
it

She was healed by Christian Science

You dont mean it

Indeed I do

Mrs Evringham thanked her holy stars that Eloise was absent

Well I never for one moment classed your mother as a _malade
imaginaire_ exclaimed the lady

Her companion raised his eyebrows I fancy no one did who knew her

You believe it then

I should be an idiot if I didnt

Do you mean to say she is out of her wheeled chair

No chairs for her now When she wishes to walk she walks

Then she always could declared Mrs Evringham

I think you know better than that returned the other calmly

How long since asked Mrs Evringham

Three months

Silence

Arent you glad for her asked Bonnell with a slight smile of
curiosity into the disturbed face I ought to have told you at first
that osteopathy did it then after your joy had subsided break the
truth gently

Of course Im glad returned the other stiffly but Id rather Eloise
did not hear of it at once

May I know why

Certainly We have a very dear friend who is a physician It looks very
much as if he might be something nearer than a friend It is he with
whom Eloise is riding this afternoon It is very distasteful naturally
to have these alleged cures discussed in our family We have had some
annoyance in that line already You can understand how doctors must
feel

Yes so long as they believe a cure to be only alleged but where one
is convinced that previously hopeless conditions have been healed and
it does happen once in a while they are glad of it Im confident We
havent a finer broader minded class of men in our country than our
physicians

I think so agreed Mrs Evringham drawing herself up with a fleeting
vision of the Ballard place on Mountain Avenue

But they are not the wealthiest at the start said Nat Is it
possible that you are allowing Eloise to ride unchaperoned with a young
physician

Mrs Evringham did not remark the threatening curves at the corners of
the speakers lips

Oh this one is different she returned seriously very fine
connections and substantial in _every_ way

Her companion threw back his head and laughed frankly

We have to smile at each other once in a while dont we Mrs
Evringham he said in the light caressing manner which had for a few
years been one of her chief worries but all the same youre fond of
me just as long as I dont forget my place eh Youre glad to see me

You know I am Mrs Evringham pressed her hand against the laces over
her heart Such a bittersweet feeling comes over me at the very tones
of your voice Oh the happy past Nat Gone forever She touched a
dainty handkerchief to her eyes I suppose your mother is still in her
apartment

She has taken a place at View Point for the summer and has set her
heart on a long visit from you

How very kind of her responded Mrs Evringham with genuine gratitude
I dont know what father means to do in the hot weather or whether
heor whether I should wish to go with him Your mother and I always
enjoyed each other when she was sufficiently free from suffering

That time is always now returned Nat a fullness of gratitude in his
voice

His companion looked at him curiously I cant realize it

Come and see was his reply

I will I certainly will I shall anticipate it with great pleasure

A very convenient place to prepare a part of Eloises trousseau Mrs
Evringham was considering and the girl safely engaged Nats presence
would have no terrors You think you are really getting into a good
business arrangement now she asked aloud

Very I wake up in the morning wondering at my own good fortune

I am so glad my dear boy responded the other sympathetically
Perhaps after all you will be able to wait for a little more chin
than Miss Caton has Of course shes a very _nice_ girl and all that

Bonnell smiled at the carpet

They talked on for half an hour of mutual friends over cups of tea and
then he rose to go

Eloise will be sorry said Mrs Evringham effusively Its such a
long way out here and so difficult for you to get the time It isnt as
if you could come easily

Oh I have several days here Im staying at the Reevess Do you know
them

No returned the lady trying to conceal that this was a blow

It is Mr Reeves with whom I am going into business and we are doing
some preliminary work I shall see Eloise soon Remember me to her

Yes certainly replied Mrs Evringham She kept a stiff upper lip
until she was alone and then a troubled line grew in her forehead

It will be all right of course if things are settled she thought
I can scarcely wait for Eloise to come home



Jewel had come from the barn straight to her room where she thought
upon her problem with the aids she loved

At last she went downstairs to a side door to watch for Zeke as he drove
from the barn on his way to the station to meet Mr Evringham As the
horse walked out of the barn she emerged and intercepted the coachman

Mrs Forbes at a window saw Zeke stop She wondered what Jewel was
saying to him wondered with a humble gratitude novel to her dominating
nature

Wait one minute Zeke said the child Ive been wondering whether I
ought to say anything to grandpa

If you do Ill lose my place returned the young fellow and Ive
never done wrong by the horses yet

I know you havent God has taken care of you hasnt he Zeke Do you
think its right for me not to tell grandpa Ive decided that Ill do
whatever you say

It was the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove Zeke
nervously fingering the whip handle looked down into the guileless face
and mentally vowed never to betray the trust he saw there

Then dont tell him Jewel he returned rather thickly for the
fullness in his throat You come out to the barn the way you said you
would and well talk over things I dont care if the boys do laugh
Ive sworn off I believe you helped Essex Maid the other night I
believe you can help me

Jewels eyes were joyful If you know you _want_ help Zeke then
youll get it Mother says thats the first thing Mortal mind is so
proud

Mine aint strutting much returned Zeke as he drove on

Jewel amused herself about the grounds until the phaeton should return
with her grandfather

When she saw it coming she ran down to the gate and hopped and skipped
back beside it Mr Evringham watching her gyrations unsmilingly

As he dismounted at the piazza she clung to his hand going up the steps
Which are you going to do grandpa go riding or play golf

Which do you want me to do he asked

When you ride its more fun for me she replied

He seated himself in one of the chairs and she leaned against its broad
arm

Its rather more fun for me too Im growing lazy I think Ill ride

Good

What have you been doing today Jewel

Wellmeditativelycousin Eloise went to New York so I had to get
my lesson alone And I didnt braid my hair over

Mr Evringham looked startled Shell do it I dare say before
dinner he replied

If she has time She has gone riding with Dr Ballard They just
trotted away together Oh it was lovely

Mr Evringham leaning his head back looked off under his heavy brows
as he responded

 Across the hills and far away
 Beyond their utmost purple rim
 And deep into the dying day
 The happy princess followed him

and all that sort of business I suppose

I dont know what you mean said Jewel doubtfully

I should hope not Well what else have you done Been treating any
rheumatism I havent had it since the sun shone

You never asked me to returned the child

Mr Evringham smiled The sunshine is a pretty good treatment he
observed

Sometimes your belief comes into my thought said Jewel and of
course I always turn on it and think the truth

Much obliged Im sure Id like to turn on it myself at times

You can study with cousin Eloise and me if youd like to said Jewel
eagerly

Oh thank you thank you rejoined the broker hastily Dont disturb
yourself There must be some sinners you know or the saints would have
to go out of businessnobody to practice on Well have you been to the
ravine

Oh yes Anna Belle and I and we had more _fun_ We made a garden

Morning or afternoon

Morning

Well I wish to know said Mr Evringham in a suddenly serious and
impressive tone I wish to know if you reached home in time for lunch

Jewel felt somewhat startled under the daze of his piercing eyes but
her conscience was clear Yes I was here in plenty of time I wanted
to surely not be late so I was here too soon

Thats what I was afraid of returned Mr Evringham gravely I
dont wish you to be unpunctual but I object equally to your returning
unnecessarily early when you wish to stay

But I couldnt help it grandpa Jewel began earnestly when he
interrupted her

So Ive brought you this he added and took from his pocket an oblong
package sealed at each end

The child laid her doll in the brokers laphe had become hardened to
this indignityand her fingers broke the seals and slipped the paper
from a morocco case

Push the spring in the end said Mr Evringham

She obeyed The lid flew up and disclosed a small silver chatelaine
watch The pin was a cherubs head its wings enameled in white as
were the back and edges of the little timepiece whose hands were busily
pointing to blue figures

Jewel gasped For me

Her grandfather smoothed his mustache He had presented gifts to ladies
before but never with such effect

Grandpa grandpa she exclaimed touching the little watch in
wondering delight See what Divine Love has sent me

Mr Evringham raised his eyebrows and smiled but he was soon assured
that Loves messenger was not forgotten He was instantly enveloped in
a rapturous hug and heroically endured the bitter of the watchcase
pressing into his jugular for the sweet of the roseleaf kisses that
were assaulting his cheek like the quick reports of a tiny Gatling gun

See if you can wind it he said at last

Jewel lifted her treasure tenderly from its velvet bed and he showed
her how to twist its stem and then pinned it securely on the breast of
her light sailor suit where she looked down upon it in rapt admiration

Now then Jewel you have no excuse he said severely

She raised her happy eyes while her hand pressed the satin surface of
her watch Grandpa grandpa she said sighing ecstatically youre
such a joker



CHAPTER XXIV

THE RAVINE GARDEN

Mrs Evringham tried heroically to look impassive when her daughter
returned from the ride There was barely time then to dress for dinner
and no opportunity for confidences before the meal nor afterward until
bedtime but the look of peace and sweetness in Eloises face could have
but one significance to the mother who believed that peace lay only in
the direction upon which she had set her heart

Mr Evringham took coffee with them after dinner in the drawingroom
while Jewel caressed her watch never tiring of looking at its clear
face and the little second hand which traveled so steadily its tiny
circuit

Mrs Evringham looked often toward the door expectant of the doctors
entrance The evening wore on and he did not come Still Eloises face
wore the placid restful expression A gentle ease with her grandfather
replaced her old manner

Her mother determined to try an experiment

You could never guess who called today Eloise she said suddenly

Her daughter looked up from her coffee No Who was it

Nat Bonnell

Really The girls tone indicated great surprise and that only I
wish I might have seen him

The addition was made so calmly almost perfunctorily that Mrs
Evringham smiled with exultation

She turned to her fatherinlaw Who would believe that Mr Bonnell
was Eloises brightest flame a year ago How soon are we forgot she
said lightly

When Jewel had kissed them all goodnight and gone upstairs and Mr
Evringham had withdrawn to his library Mrs Evringham took her childs
hand and looked fondly into her eyes

Well she asked

Well returned Eloise do tell me everything Nat said

After youve told me everything Dr Ballard said I supposed youd fly
to tell me dear

The girl looked tenderly back into the eyes that were sharp with
inquiry Dear little mother she returned it cant be

What cant be

What you wish Dr Ballard

Have yourefused him Mrs Evringhams face whitened and
unconsciously she stepped back

It didnt have to come to that Dr Ballard is so finesuch a wise man
in so many ways I do admire him so much

What did you say to him I will know exclaimed Mrs Evringham
passionately

Eloise was mute and her eyes besought her mother

Speak I say Was it Christian Science Did you dare Eloise Evringham
did you _dare_ spoil your lifemy lifeour future by scaring Dr
Ballard with that bugbear The angry woman was breathing fast

Mother dear dont give us something so painful to remember Dont I
beg of you Dr Ballard does not reproach me He thinks I shall change
and he wishes to give me time to see if I do Think of him if you will
not think of me He would be so shocked to have you take it this way
If you could have seen how kind he was how patient Dear mother dont
cry It isnt anything I can help unless I should deliberately turn
dishonest

But Mrs Evringham did cry and heartily She hurried away to her own
room as quickly as possible and locked the door against Eloise who lay
awake for hours with a strange mingling of regret and joy at her heart
and a constant declaring of the truth

At midnight the girl heard the door unlock and saw her mother emerge

Darling mamma she exclaimed springing out of bed

Oh Eloise moaned the poor woman dissolving again upon her childs
shoulder I never went to bed without your kiss and I cant bear it
How can you be so crucrucruel

Darling everything is going to come right returned Eloise holding
her close Nothing good would come of doing wrong I never loved you so
much as now I never saw duty so plainly Dearest in one way I suffer
for you but still I was never so happy I have grasped the end of the
clue that will surely lead us safely through the labyrinth no matter
what life brings You will see mamma dear after a while you will see
Dont go back Come into my bed

Disconsolately Mrs Evringham obeyed and in a few minutes worn out
with emotion she had sobbed herself to sleep in her childs arms and
although for many days afterward she wore a languid air and declared
that there was nothing to live for she yielded herself to Eloises
courageous and quietly joyful atmosphere with silent wonder at her
childs altered outlook

On the morning following the painful interview with her mother Eloise
presented herself in Jewels room at the usual hour

Smiling she approached the child and exhibited three fresh new books
India paper editions of the Bible and Science and Health and the
little brown pamphlet were in her hands

Yours exclaimed the child

Eloise nodded

Good good Jewel hopped up and down and forthwith brought Anna Belle
to have her share in the rejoicing

You were afraid you couldnt get them Now see cried the child
triumphantly As if Divine Love couldnt send you those books

He showed me a way returned the girl See where Ive written my
name I want you to put Jewel right under it in each one

Oh in those lovely books said the child doubtfully I dont write
very well

Yes I want it dear when we go downstairs and can get some ink Did
anybody fix your hair yesterday

I just brushed it down real smooth on the outside returned the child

It looks so said Eloise laughing Lets fix it before we have the
lesson By the way what time is it Jewel

The little girl smiled back at her cousins reflection in the glass and
took the open morocco case from the bureau Anna Belle and I put him
to bed last night she said looking fondly at the silver cherub on
its velvet couch Weve named him Little Faithful Hell come to the
lesson too I know hes going to be a lovely Scientist

Im sure I hope he will and neither be fast nor lazy returned
Eloise as she unbraided the short pigtails

I tell you it wasnt so nice getting the lesson alone yesterday said
Jewel You were away all day Did you have a nice ride

Yes Eloise responded slowly The day was very niceand so is Dr
Ballard

Did he enjoy it asked the child hopefully The doctor had been a good
deal on her mind

Some of the time responded Eloise soberly

Why not all the time Did error creep in

The older girl brushed away in silence for a minute

I didnt mean to talk about grownup things said the child somewhat
abashed Mother says I must be careful not to

It is all right Jewel The new ideas I have been learning have made
me see some things so clearly One is to perceive what it is that really
draws people together in a bond that cannot be broken There is only one
thing that can do it and will do it and that is loving the same truth
Two people can have a very good time together for a while and like each
other very much but the time comes when their thoughts fly apart unless
that one bond of union is thereunless they love the same spiritual
truth

The speaker caught in the glass the childs eyes fixed attentively
upon her

Wouldnt Dr Ballard look at our book asked Jewel softly

No dear

The child reflected a minute and her eyes filled I just love him
she said

Her cousin stooped and kissed her cheek You well may she returned
quietly He deserves it

They studied the lesson and then went downstairs where Jewel in her
very best hand slowly transcribed her name in the new books then she
told Eloise that she was going out to the barn

Im going to visit with Zeke she said He has a claim of error and
he is willing Science should help him

Is he ill

Jewel looked off It isnt that kind of error

There are plenty worse rejoined Eloise She looked doubtfully at the
little girl Wouldnt you better tell me dear Is it right for you to
go

Yes its right His mother knows it and shes so kind to me What do
you think At breakfast she asked me if I wouldnt like to bring Anna
Belle down She says I can bring her to the table whenever I want to
Isnt it nice The dear little creature has been so patient never
having a thing to eat

Eloise could not help laughing the manner in which Jewel finished
was so suddenly quaint but she shook her head in silent wonder as she
watched the short skirted figure setting forth for the barn

Oh cousin Eloise Jewel turned around Will you come to the ravine
after lunch and see what Anna Belle and I have done

Yes

Jewel walked on a little further and turned again You wont wear your
watch will you she called

No Ill surely forget it returned the girl smiling

The small figure went on well content

Oh if I could only be invisible in that barn soliloquized Eloise
How I would like to hear what she will say How wonderful it is that
that little child has more chance of success whatever trouble Zeke has
been getting into than any fullgrown experienced sage philosopher
or reformer who is a worker in mortal mind

Anna Belle came to luncheon that day Mrs Forbes actually put a cushion
in one of the chairs to lift the honored guest to such a height that
her rosy smile was visible above the tablecloth Not content with this
hospitality the housekeeper brought a breadandbutter plate upon
which she placed such small proportions of food as might be calculated
to tempt a dainty appetite Jewel felt almost embarrassed by the
eminence to which her child was suddenly raised

Oh thank you Mrs Forbes she said you neednt take so much
trouble Anna Belles just used to having a part of mine

But nothing now was too good for Anna Belle She shall have a
cupcustard tomorrow returned the housekeeper

Mrs Evringham looked on with lacklustre eyes As well make much of
Anna Belle as any other idol Everything was stuffed with sawdust

How the sunbeams glanced in the woods that day as Jewel one hand
clasping her doll and the other in Eloises skipped along the road to
the ravine

When they had stooped under the wire and gone down the bank how the
brook sang and how the violets bloomed in Jewels garden

Its very pretty said Eloise regarding the paths and flower beds
which Jewel exhibited with pride Its very pretty but it lacks one
thing

What asked the child eagerly

A pond

But it is by the side of a rushing river returned Jewel

Yes but all the more easy to have a pond

How

Well set a shallow pan and sink it in the ground and plant ferns
about it to hang over Anna Belle can have some little china dolls to go
in wading in it

Oh yes yes cried Jewel delighted Hear that dearie Hear what Love
is planning for you

Anna Belles nose was buried in the grass and her hat was awry If she
had a fault it was a tendency to being overdressed At present her
plumed hat and large fluffy boa gave her an aspect unsympathetic with
the surroundings Jewel pulled her upright and placed her on the mossy
divan

If Id only brought the trowel I could get the hole ready Jewel was
saying when a whistle soft and clear as a flute sounded above the
brooks gurgle

She lifted a finger in caution Oh she whispered looking up into her
cousins face the loveliest bird Hush

Clear sweet flexible somewhere among those high branches sounded
again the same elaborate phrase

Jewel was surprised to see her cousins pleased listening expression
alter to eager wonder then the girl flushed rosy red and started up
Siegfried she murmured

Again came the bird motif sifting down through the rustling leaves

Nat called Eloise gladly

Any nymphs down there questioned a mans voice

Oh yes

May Pan come down

Yes indeed

Jewel watching and wondering saw a young man in light clothes swing
himself down from tree to tree and at last saw both his hands close on
both her cousins

The two talked and laughed in unison for a minute then Eloise freed
herself and turned to the seriousfaced child You remember my speaking
of Nat the other day she asked This is he Mr Bonnell this is my
cousin Jewel Evringham She is landscape gardening just now and may not
feel like giving you her hand

I can wash it said Jewel dipping the earthy member in the brook
wiping it on the grass and placing it in the large one that was offered
her

How did you ever find us I thought youd gone back to New York I had
no idea of seeing you said Eloise in a breath

Didnt your mother tell you I have a week off

The girls bright face sobered Poor mother She had aa shock after
you were here yesterday I suppose it put everything out of her head
Was it she who sent you to find us

No a massive lady met me at the door and informed me that your mother
wished to be excused from every one today but that you had fallen down
a crack in the earth which could be reached up this road The speaker
looked about As there doesnt seem any place to stand here hadnt we
better sit down before we fall in the brook I might rescue you but the
current is swift

Eloise at once sank upon the green incline and he followed her example
Jewel watched him with consideration and he became aware of her gaze

What are you making little girl he asked with his sunshiny smile

A garden and I could dig the pond if I had brought the trowel

Perhaps my knife will do He took it out and opened the largest blade
What do you think of that

Do you suppose I should break it asked the child doubtfully

Youre welcome to try he replied

She leaned forward and accepted it from his outstretched hand



CHAPTER XXV

MUTUAL SURPRISES

I thought I knew BelAir Park said Bonnell looking about him I
never suspected this

Jewel is the Columbus of this spot She has named it the Ravine of
Happiness

Nat looked at his speaker Thats rather ambiguous Does she mean where
happiness is buried or where it is found

Eloise smiled Jewel never buries any happiness Well how is
everybody Nat Your mother first of all

Didnt Mrs Evringham tell you

The girls face clouded with apprehension at his surprised tone
No You will think it very strange but poor mamma was under such
excitement you must pardon her Everything went out of her head Dont
tell me that dear Mrs Bonnellshe lowered her voicethat you have
lost her

He shook his head No Ive gained her Shes well

Well repeated the girl amazed Why what do you mean How glorious
How long since

About three months

I am so glad Tell me more good news Tell me about your own frivoling
and then I shall hear about the other people

The young man shook his head I observed Lent this year scrupulously
and I havent changed my tactics since Easter Ive been keeping my nose
to the grindstone Began to see things a little differently Eloise I
decided it was mothers inningsdecided to drop the butterfly and do
the bee act

Is it possible The girl laughed Will wonders never cease What was
the matter Did the heiresses cut you

I cut the whole thing and I have my reward I suppose your mother
didnt tell you that either Im going into business with Mr Reeves
Do you know him Jewel does He smiled toward the child who lifted an
interested face

Yes I do she said You remember about him cousin Eloise

Certainly The girl looked at her friend questioningly

Im spending this week at his house

And you know about Jewel He has told you

Certainly The one person of his acquaintance who hasnt to unlearn
anything

You mean he talked to you of Christian Science

Bonnells hands were clasping his knees His hat lay on the bank beside
him and the thick hair tossed away from his brow He nodded slowly
wondering at the sudden attentive interest of her look

Yes he replied We talked on the tabooed subject

Tabooed with whom You she asked disappointedly

No with you I understand

Color flew into Eloises face Who told you that Mother of course

Bonnell nodded giving a fleeting glance toward the child who was again
busy at her excavation

Are congratulations in order Eloise he asked quietly

Yes congratulations Her eyes grew full of light For I have come to
see the truth That child has shown me

The young mans lips remained apart for a second in his surprise at this
declaration after Mrs Evringhams detailed representations

Then I may tell you how my mother was healed he said at last

Oh was it really so

Yes

And you Nat Unconsciously Eloise leaned her whole body toward him
supporting her hand on the ground You know about it yourself You
understand

Yes

And you believe in it

With all my heart

Her face shone Oh Jewel do you hear Mr Bonnell is a Scientist
The girls breathing was hastened Her eyes were like stars

The child sank back from her work and regarded the visitor smiling She
was glad but she was not astonished In her world a great many young
men had found the key to life but to Eloise it was something wonderful
She looked at her old friend as if she had never seen him before She
reviewed all she knew of his gay life with its background of suffering

Do you study the lessons she asked incredulously _You_

Every day I am surprised beyond measure to find you interested for
your mother told meAnd the doctor

Is a very fine man returned Eloise gravely as he paused

Bonnells mental questions were answered by her manner He put his hand
in the pocket of his sack coat and drew out a small thin black book

Eloise took it Unity of Good she read on its cover I havent
seen this one she said eagerly

You will he replied

She looked up Do you know I thought just now you were going to take
out your pipe she said naively Thats where you used to keep it

My pipe doesnt like me any more he rejoined quietly

Are you happy Nat she asked scrutinizing his face with childlike
searching eyes

I was never a very solemn codger was I he returned

But are you happier Does the world look different Of course it does
with your mother well

Oh yes he answered in a changed tone tossing his head back and
making a gesture as of throwing away something There was nothing in it
before nothing in it

Yes yes I know she returned comprehendingly

Jewel had watched them and now as they paused her voice broke the
silence in which the two friends looked into each others faces

Cousin Eloise is going to church with me on Sunday she announced

Oh certainly Bonnell smiled Wednesday evening meetings and all
now Eloise Havent you attended yet

No Ive only just learned Ive only just seen Im only beginning to
see Nat Your mother was healed Oh it is _true_ isnt it Its so
wonderful to find that you _you_ know more about it than I do when I
supposed you would scorn it I cant help expecting to wake up

That is just what you will do returned Bonnell You will wakento a
thousand things So your mother objects

Poor little mother returned Eloise looking down with sudden sadness

My mother wants you and yours to make us a long visit at View Point
this summer

The girls lovely eyes raised hopefully The best thing that could
happen she exclaimed

I think so responded her companion

When Mr Evringham returned from golf that afternoon only his
daughterinlaw was in sight She inclined her head toward him with the
air of a Lady Macbeth

Have you seen anything of the girls she asked as he approached her

Nothing Where are they

She slowly shrugged her shoulders Im the last one to ask They
wouldnt think of telling me she returned

Whats up now thought Mr Evringham You dont look well Madge he
said aloud

Once she would have welcomed the evidence of solicitude Now nothing
mattered

I dont feel well she replied and I cant even call the physician I
prefer

Mr Evringham stared down at her for a silent minute and light broke
upon him

Is it all off with Ballard he asked bluntly

Yes and thats what you have done father by allowing that child
Jewel to come here

Mr Evringham bit his lip This amused him

Eloise has mounted the new hobby and is riding for dear life away from
common sense away from everything that promised such happiness

Do you mean Christian Science

Of course I do

Its a strange thing Madge Do you know it captures people with good
heads Mr Evringham seated himself near his daughters chair I
came out on the train with my friend Reeves He was talking about young
Bonnell of whom you spoke last night Said his mother was cured when
the doctors couldnt do anything You know her eh

As well as if she were my own flesh and blood

Is it a fact what they say

She was considered incurable I know nothing about the rest of it
Nat was telling me yesterday Now he is probably infatuated also and
sooner or later Eloise is sure to meet him

Hm hm An old flame you said remarked Mr Evringham Indeed
Indeed I trust for your sake Madge that his is not objectionable to
you

He is snapped Mrs Evringham A poor fellow with his way to make
in the world Hes been out of college a couple of years and hasnt done
anything worth speaking of yet

Reeves is going to take him into the business returned Mr Evringham
I dont know why or wherefore but the mere fact is decidedly
promising

Oh who can tell if that will last returned the other with scornful
pessimism Nat has let too many cotillions to do anything else well I
can only pray that he will get away without seeing Eloise Mrs Bonnell
has invited us to make her a visit this summer I certainly shall not go
one step

A sudden sound of laughter was heard on the quiet air Mrs Evringham
leaned forward There are the children now she said as
figures turned in at the gateway and who is that It iswith
desperationhes here Nat Bonnell is with them

She sat upright with disapproval clasping the arm of her chair while
her fatherinlaw looked curiously at the approaching group His gaze
fixed on the young man with the wellset head who swinging his hat in
his hand was talking fast to Eloise of something that amused them both
Jewel apparently interrupted him and he stooped with a quick motion
and in a second she was sitting on his shoulder shrieking in gleeful
surprise

Thus they approached the piazza and came close before noting that it was
occupied

Grandpa see me cried Jewel delightedly

Bonnell met the unsmiling gaze of his host as Mr Evringham rose and
then caught sight of Mrs Evringham stonily gazing from her chair

Ah how do you do he called laughingly

Jove he is a good looking chap thought the host and Bonnell set
Jewel down at his feet with such velocity that Anna Belle was cast
heavily to earth

A thousand pardons exclaimed Nat catching up the doll by the skirt
and restoring her

Jewel gave him a bright look _She_ knows there is no sensation in
matter she said scornfully

Poor Anna Belle The topography of the ravine was full of hazards for
her and her seasons there were always so adventurous and full of sudden
and unlookedfor bumps that her philosophy was well tested and she
might reasonably have complained of this gratuitous blow but she smiled
on as Jewel hugged her Her mental poise was marvelous whatever might
be said of the physical

Eloise introduced her friend and went to her mothers side while
Bonnell shook hands with Mr Evringham and exchanged some words
concerning Mr Reeves and business matters

Wide awake was the older mans mental comment Doesnt seem at all
the sort of person to be fooled about that healing business Good eye
Good manner Perhaps this was Ballards handicap all the time I guess
youre in for it Madge

Nat moved to greet Mrs Evringham who gave him no welcoming smile She
leaned back listlessly not caring what effect she produced He seemed
to her a part of the combination entered into by the Fates to thwart and
annoy

Bonnell knew her nearly as well as Eloise did Im sorry youre under
the weather he said sympathetically when he had discovered that in
his own phrase there was nothing doing I received a letter from my
mother today in which she impressed upon me that she expected you both
by the middle of June

My plans have changed since yesterday Nat returned Mrs Evringham
dismally Yes We shall not be able to go to your mothers as I had
hoped Some time during the season I shall try to look in on her of
course You tell her so Nat when you write

Nonsense nonsense Mrs Evringham You dont in the least mean it he
returned cheerfully with the smile and manner which she could not and
would not endure

I do mean it Nat I tell you my plans are changed Eloise and I may go
to Europe

Naturally she had never thought of Europe until that moment but that
laughing caressing light in Nat Bonnells eyes was insufferable

Ah in that case of course he returned we couldnt say a word
and then he moved to go

Mr Evringham urged the visitor to stay to dinner but he declined and
once more shook hands

Goodby Jewel he said to the child Sunday you know

Yes indeed I know she returned an irresistible tendency to hop
moving her feet On nearer acquaintance she had found Mr Bonnell
exhilarating

Goodby Nat said Eloise

He looked into the face on which rested a cloud I think you might be a
degree more attentive he suggested

How

Ohtake me to the gate for instance

Eloise smiled and went with him He turned with a slight bow that
included the group and they strolled down the path

Its all up Madge remarked Mr Evringham half smiling No use
wriggling no use staying away from the mother Might as well yield
gracefully I think Ballard might have been told thats all

There was nothing to tell father How can you be so unkind Thats
just Nats manner He is used to everybody liking him and always having
his own way but Eloise nevershe _never_the speaker saw that if she
continued in a moment more she would be weeping and she certainly was
not going to weep in this company So she contented herself by
glaring toward the gate where could be seen two figures in earnest
conversation

I had counted so much on Mrs Bonnells influence Eloise was saying
What does mother mean She knows my mind is made up as to Christian
Science What is she afraid of

Bonnell caught his thumbs in his coat pockets and lifted himself
slightly on his toes She is afraid of me

Of you The girl lifted surprised eyes to his and let them fall again
her grave face coloring

She has always been more or less afraid of me Im ineligible you
know

Yes you are awfully Nat returned Eloise earnestly Thats what
makes you so nice Didnt we always have a good time together

Yes on those rare occasions when we had a chance but Mrs Evringham
always suspected me She never felt certain that I wasnt waiting for
your skirts to be lengthened and your hair to go up in order to steal
you

Eloise tried to look at him but found it more comfortable to examine
the inexpressive gravel path But now you have something to think of
besides girls she said gently

Yes Do you know Eloise if I had been promised the granting of one
wish as I took the cars for BelAir it would have been that I might
find you convinced of the truth of Christian Science

She looked at him now brightly gladly It is such a help to me to know
that you are in it she returned Their hands simultaneously went forth
and clasped What shall we do about mother

He smiled That will all come right he returned confidently

There are classes Nat she said Have you been through one

Not yet Perhaps we could enter together

Do you think so she returned eagerly

He was looking down at her stillcalm strong

She started I mustnt be late to dinner Goodby Sunday Nat

Not tomorrow I want some golf

Yes go Its a fine links Im sorry but Id better not go there for
the present Goodby

She was gone so he strolled on and out through the park and as he
went he put two and two together and suspected the cause of the girls
objection to golf



CHAPTER XXVI

ON WEDNESDAY EVENING

This is my silk dress grandpa said Jewel coming out on the piazza
Sunday morning

Mr Evringham was sitting there reading the paper He looked up to
behold his granddaughter standing expectantly

She had on the cherished frock Her plump black legs ended in new shoes
the brim of her large hat was wreathed with daisies snowy ribbons
finished her wellbrushed braids while happiest touch of all Little
Faithful was ticking away on her breast

Well who is this bonnie lassie asked Mr Evringham viewing her

Its my best one said Jewel smilingly coming close to him

I should hope so If you were anything grander I should have to put on
smoked glasses to look at you Church eh He took the brown pamphlet
she carried and examined it

Yes I wish you were coming

Oh I have an important engagement at the golf club this morning

Have you Well grandpa I was thinking you cant play golf or ride at
night and wouldnt you take me Wednesday evening

Where to

Church

Heavens child Wednesday evening prayer meeting asked the broker in
perturbation

No Its just lovely reading and singing and interesting stories
replied Jewel endeavoring to paint the picture as attractively as
possible

Hm Hm Do you suppose Mr Reeves goes

Why of course replied the child Scientists never stay away

Then should I be considered a Scientist if I went I still have some
regard for my reputation

A great many visitors go replied the child earnestly Then she added
with unmistakably sincere naivete I dont mind leaving you in the
daytime because were used to it but I was thinking it would make
me homesick grandpa to go away in the evening and leave you in the
library

Mr Evringham took her little hand in his Have you thought Jewel he
asked how it will be when you leave me altogether

I shall have mother and father then returned the child

Yes but whom shall I have

The question came curtly and Jewel looked into the deepset eyes in
surprise Shall you miss me grandpa she asked wonderingly

Whom shall I have I say he repeated

The child thought a minute Just who you had before she answered
slipping her arm around his neck Theres Essex Maid you know

The broker gave a short laugh Yes Its lucky isnt it he returned
rather bitterly

Do you like to have me with you grandpa pursued the child pleased

Yes confound it Jewel yes

Then Divine Love will fix it somehow for I love to be with you too

You do eh Then Ill tell you that I received a letter from your
father yesterday It was a very pleasant letter but it said they felt
obliged if they could to stay over a little longertwo or three weeks
longer

The childs face grew thoughtful

He said they had just received your letter and were very pleased and
thankful to know that you were happy He said it would be a business
advantage to them to stay but that they could come home at the
appointed time if you wished it I am to cable them tomorrow if you
do Silence for a minute while Jewel thought Do you think you can be
happy with me a little longer than you expected

I do want to see mother and father very much returned the child but
Im just as happy as anything she added heartily after a pause

Mr Evringham had listened with surprising anxiety for the verdict
Very well very well he returned with extra brusqueness picking up
his newspaper I guess there wont be anything to prevent my going
to that meeting with you Wednesday evening Jewel Just once you
understand once only

At this moment the brougham drove around to the steps and Eloise came
out upon the piazza She was a vision of dainty purity in her white
gown white hat and gloves

Mr Evringham rose lifted his hat and going down the steps opened
the door of the carriage A man need not be ashamed to have these two
ladies represent him at church he said looking into Eloises calm
eyes

She smiled back at him There was no suspicion now of sarcasm or stings
The air she breathed was wholesome and inviting The lump had been
leavened

Arrived at the hall where the services were held the girls were ushered
into good seats before the room rapidly filled

They saw Mr Reeves and his family and Mr Bonnell come in on the other
side and the latter did not rest until he had found them and sent over
a bright quick nod

The platform was beautiful by a tall vase of roses at the side of the
white readingdesk and Eloise listened eagerly to the voices of the
man and woman who alternately read the morning lesson The peace
simplicity and quiet of the service enthralled her She looked over the
crowd of listening reverent faces with wistful wonder Nat was among
them _Nat_ Sometimes she glanced across at his attentive face Nat at
church in the morning thoroughly interested She pinched her arm to
make quite certain

Once when they rose to sing it was the hymn she had heard The voices
swelled

 Oer waiting harpstrings of the mind
 There sweeps a strain
 Low sad and sweet whose measures bind
 The power of pain

The girl in the white dress did not sing She swallowed often The voice
of the child at her side soared easily

 And oer earths troubled angry sea
 I see Christ walk
 And come to me and tenderly
 Divinely talk

What a haven of promise and peace seemed this sunny simple place of
purity

 From tired joy and grief afar
 And nearer Thee
 Father where Thine own children are
 I love to be

Jewel looking up at her companion was surprised to see her lashes wet
and her lower lip caught between her teeth

Whats the matter cousin Eloise she whispered softly as they sat
down

The girl tried to smile Words were not at her command Gladness she
returned briefly which reply caused Jewel to meditate for some time

They had a talk with Nat and were presented to the Reeves family after
church and Eloise felt herself in an atmosphere of love

Jewel left the group for a private word to Zeke before her cousin
should come to enter the brougham Zekiel sat bolt upright in the most
approved style and did not turn his face even when the child addressed
him

Ive been wondering this morning she said how we can manage for you
to come to church Zekiel

Oh I have it six times a week returned the coachman

But its so lovely just to listen to them read and not have to hunt up
the places or anything

Im satisfied with my minister returned Zeke almost smiling

Eloise and Mr Bonnell came out to the carriage so there was no further
time for talk

The subject remained in Jewels mind however On Wednesday morning
just before Mr Evringham went to the station the child seized him in
the hall

Grandpa dont you think it would be nice to go in the trolley car to
church tonight

Towhere asked the broker frowning

This is the night were going to church you know

The devAh to be sure So we are Wellawhat did you say Trolley
car Why

Well we could all go then you know returned Jewel Cousin Eloise
wants to go but the childs honesty compelled her she wouldnt have
to go with us because it is Mr Bonnells last night in BelAir and
I heard him ask if he might come for her but I do so want Zeke to go
grandpa

Well for the love ofbegan the broker slowly

Yes Zeke is getting to understand a good deal about Christian Science
He has some claims of error that his mother knows about and they make
her sorry and Ive been helping him and reading to him out of my books
and I do want him to go to the testimonial meeting so much

The child looked wistfully up into the dark eyes that rested upon her
Mr Evringham had remarked his housekeepers change of spirit toward the
little girl had wondered at the increasing and even reckless indulgence
of Anna Belle who from being an exile in the stair closet had now
arrived at a degree of consideration and pampering which threatened to
turn her head

Jewel he said impressively I wish you to understand one thing
distinctly You are not now or at any future time to try to make a
Christian Scientist of Essex Maid

From wondering sobriety Jewels lips broke into a gleeful smile I
dont have to she cried triumphantly She is one Anyway she has
demonstrated everything a horse ought to

Mr Evringham flung his hands over his head despairingly Great
heavens he exclaimed tragically rushing out to the brougham Jewel at
his heels in peals of laughter

But they went to church in the trolley car Eloise reached the same
place with Mr Bonnell but whether she walked or drove or rode nobody
ever knew and it didnt matter much for a full moon illumined the
night

Early in the evening a young man entered the hall quietly and took a
back seat It was Zeke

Mr Reeves saw Jewel and her grandfather come in and softly he smote
his knee Shes done it he ejaculated mentally He noted the brokers
haughty carriage the half challenging glances he threw to right and
left as he proceeded up the aisle to the position of Jewels choice

Mr Reeves composed his countenance with some difficulty and catching
the wandering eye gave his friend a grave bow

Testimonial meetings differ in point of continued interest This proved
to be a good one The most interesting narrative of the evening was Nat
Bonnells His self possession fine presence and good voice made more
effective the marvelous story of his mothers resurrection to strength
He told it with dignity and directness and Mr Evringham was impressed

Whats my rheumatism to that eh Jewel he whispered as Nat sat
down

Just nothing grandpa replied the child

You think the Creatord consider me worth attending to eh

God doesnt know you have the rheumatism exclaimed Jewel with soft
scorn

Doesnt Well Ive always supposed He thought I needed reminding on
account of a number of things and so touched me up with that I didnt
blame Him much

If He knew it it would be real and then it couldnt be changed
returned Jewel earnestly in the ear he bent to her

The broker sat up and looked down on her large hat and short legs
Whew but Im a back number he mused

The next testimonial made Jewels eyes brighten It was given by a man
who told a story of hopeless intemperance and his familys want The
unaffected humility and gratitude that sounded in his voice as he
described the changed conditions which followed his cure caused the
roses to deepen in Jewels cheeks She wondered where Zeke was sitting

Altogether she was happy over the meeting and her grandfathers
attitude was as kindly as could have been expected

Eloise came into her mothers room that night beaming

I wish you had come with us she said It was wonderful

Mrs Evringham turned to her with a lofty air I have too much loyalty
to friendship to be seen in such a place she returned

Nat said he wouldnt ask you to come down to bid him goodby because
he expects to come out to spend Sundays for a while

Mrs Evringham looked at her daughter All the girls face had lacked of
vivacity and happy expression it wore now making her radiant

You could never guess the news I have for you mother

Mrs Evringhams lips tightened Eloise if you will not marry the fine
man who had my entire approval it will be outrageous for you to marry
an ineligible a young fellow whose goods are all in the show window
who has not proved himself in any way I refuse to hear your news she
returned impetuously

The girl laughed Do you mean Nat dear she asked her rosy face
coming close Im afraid hes going to spoil himself by becoming
eligible He has been telling me a lot about the business tonight

Ho Nat Bonnell could always talk

Eloises arms closed around her Theres only one source of supply
mother Nat has found Him I am finding Him We shall not want What do
you think I have here for you Grandfather gave it to me Eloise put
into her mothers hands a draft for a thousand dollars

Mr Evringham appeared to lose sight of the dagger she had been seeing
before her for days What is this she ejaculated A present from
father

Not at all Some unknown man owed it to papa and his conscience made
him pay the debt It came in grandfathers evening mail and he has only
just opened it

Mrs Evringham examined the paper eagerly

How wonderful she exclaimed

How natural returned Eloise That is the wonderful part of it



CHAPTER XXVII

A REALIZED HOPE

One afternoon Mr Evringham did not return from the city at the usual
time Jewel watching for him was surprised after a while to see him
walking up from the gate

Why whats happened she asked Zeke went for you

Yes but he found he had to leave Dick to be shod

Then are you going to saddle Essex Maid yourself Oh can I see you do
it grandpa She hopped with anticipation

I dont know that Ill ride just now Its an excellent day for
walking It seems rather strange to me Jewel that youve never shown
me the Ravine of Happiness You talk a good deal about it

Oh would you like to come cried the child flushing Good I have
the pond all fixed in Anna Belles garden and the ferns droop over it
just like a fairy story

Have you put up a sign for the fairies to keep out

Noo returned Jewel drawing in her chin and smiling

Oh well you may be sure theyre at it then every moonlight night
They havent a particle of respect you know for anything If I were in
Anna Belles place I should put up a sign Private Grounds

Oh shes so unselfish she wouldnt If they only wont break the
flowers she wont care returned the child entering into the fancy
with zest

Mr Evringham took the doll from her arms and carrying it up the steps
deposited it in the piazza chair

Isnt she going asked Jewel soberly

No not this time She doesnt care shes been there so much Just see
how cheerful and comfortable she looks

There was indeed a smile of almost cloying sweetness on Anna Belles
countenance and she seemed to be seeing pleasing visions

I never saw such a good child said Jewel with an admiring sigh then
she put her hand in her grandfathers and they strolled out into the
park and up the shady road Just before reaching the bend around which
lay the gorge Mr Evringham surprised his companion by breaking in upon
her lively chatter with a tune which he whistled loudly

It was such an unusual ebullition that Jewel looked up at him Why
grandpa I never heard you whistle before she said

You didnt Thats because you never before saw me out on a lark I
tell you Im a gay one when I get started and forthwith there burst
again from his lips a gay refrain that sounded shrilly up the leafy
path They rounded the bend in the road and the broker looked down into
the eyes that were bent upon him in admiration

You whistle almost as well as Mr Bonnell said the child

Give me time and I dare say I shall beat him out was the swaggering
response Ah heres your ravine is it

Yes thatsbegan Jewel and went no further

A couple of rods from where she suddenly came to a standstill was an
object which for a moment rooted her to the spot A small horse black
as jet with a white star in his forehead and a flowing wavy mane and
tail stood by the roadside His coat gleaming like satin set off the
pure white leather of his trappings On his back was fastened a side
saddle and he was tethered to the rail of the light fence

Mr Evringham appeared not to see him He was looking down the rocks and
grass of the steep incline

Is there any sort of a path he asked or do you descend it as you
would a cellar door I think you might have told me so I could change
these light trousers

Grandpa exclaimed Jewel in a hushed tone pointing before her See
that horsejust like the coal black steed the princess rides in a fairy
story

Why thats so He is a beauty Where do you suppose the princess is

Shes probably gone down the ravine returned the child her feet
drawn forward as if by a magnet Lets not go down yet

The broker allowed himself to be led close to the pony who turned his
full bright eyes upon the pair curiously

Do you think I might touch him grandpa asked the child still in the
hushed voice

If hes a fairy horse he might vanish returned Mr Evringham Lets
see how he stands it So saying he gave the shining flank some sturdy
love pats Oh hes all right Hes good substantial flesh and blood

But the lady said Jewel looking about the pupils of her eyes
dilated with excitement

Oh I dont think a very big lady has been riding in that saddle You
can do as youd be done by I fancy

Upon this Jewel stroked the pony over and over lovingly and he nosed
about her in a friendly way

Grandpa see him see him And oh grandpa see his beautiful star
white as a snowflake

Well upon my word if this isnt lucky remarked Mr Evringham Here
is some sugar in my pocket now He passed some lumps to the child

Would it be right she asked glancing down the ravine Had I better
wait till the girl comes up

She wont mind Ill wager returned Mr Evringham so the child
thus encouraged fed the coal black steed who for all his poetical
appearance had evidently a strongly developed sweet tooth

Hello whats this exclaimed the broker stepping to the fence and
taking up something black and folded When he shook it out it proved to
be a childs riding skirt

Shes left it there said Jewel eagerly We ought not to touch it
Its very hard on clothes going down the ravine and shes left it
there Dont you think grandpa you _ought_ to put it back for to her
great surprise her punctilious and particular relative was shaking the
fine skirt about recklessly and examining it

Heres a name he said bringing his prize to Jewel and showing her an
oblong bit of white cloth much as tailors use inside dresses What do
you make of it

The child disturbed by such daring and dreading to see the owner of
these splendid possessions scramble up the bank looked reluctantly

The name was a long one but so familiar that she recognized it at once
Evringham

She lifted her eyes to her grandfather Its the same as ours

There isnt another Evringham in BelAir returned the broker The
fairies dropped this for you I guess Jewel It certainly wont fit me
Lets try it on

He slipped it over the head of the dazed child and hooked it around her
waist

It fitted her exactly murmured Jewel They always say so in fairy
stories

Look here said her grandfather He put his hand into the stirrup and
drew out a folded bit of paper He handed it to the child who began to
wonder if she was dreaming

DEAR JEWEL she readI believe you expected Divine Love to send you a
horse I have come to belong to you and my name is STAR

It was astonishing what a large round penmanship the pony possessed
There was no possibility of mistaking a word

Jewel read the note over twice as she stood there the long scant
skirt making her look tall Mr Evringham stood watching her His part
in the comedy was played He waited

She looked up at him with eyes that seemed trying to comprehend a fact
too large

Grandpa have you given me this horse she asked solemnly and he
could see her hands beginning to tremble

Oh am _I_ to get some credit for this returned the broker smiling
and twisting his mustache I didnt expect that

He knew her lack of motion would not last long and was bracing himself
for the attack when to his surprise she pulled up the impeding skirt
and made a rush not for him but for the pony Hiding her face on the
creatures satin shoulder she flung her arm around his throat and
seizing his rippling mane sobbed as if her heart would break

Mr Evringham had not spent weeks in selecting and testing a horse for
his granddaughter without choosing one whose nervous system would be
proof against sudden assaults of affection but this onslaught was so
energetic that the pony tossed his head and backed to the end of his
tether

His new mistress stumbled after him her face still hidden She was
trying heroically to stifle the sobs that were shaking her from head to
foot

Jewel Jewel child ejaculated her grandfather much dismayed Come
come whats this

He drew her with a strong hand and she deserted the pony much to the
latters relief and clasping Mr Evringham as high up as she could
reach began bedewing his vest buttons with her tears

Oh gragrandpa I ccant have him she sobbed There isnt any
rooroom for him in ourour flaflaflat

Well did you expect to keep him in the flat inquired Mr Evringham
stooping tenderly his own eyes shining suspiciously as he put his arms
around the little shaking form

Nno but wewe havent any barbarn

The broker smiled above the voluminous quivering bows

Well hasnt some good livery man in your neighborhood a stable

Yeyes Jewel made greater efforts to stop crying But II talked
with momother once about coucould I hahave a horse sometime before
I grew up and she said she might buy the horse but it would cost so
muchmuch money every week to board it it would be error

Mr Evringham patted the heaving shoulder

Ah but you dont know yet all about your horse In some respects Ive
never seen a pony like him

II never have returned the child

Oh but youll be surprised at _this_ This pony has a bank account

Jewel slowly grew quiet

Nobody has to pay for _his_ board and clothes He is very independent
He would have it that way

Grandpa came in muffled tones from the brokers vest

So dont you think youd better cheer up and look at him once more and
tell him you wont cry on his shoulder very often

In a minute Jewel looked up revealing her swollen eyes Im ashamed
she said softly but he wassobe_autiful_I forgot to remember

Well I guess you did forget to remember returned Mr Evringham
shaking his head and leading the child to her ponys side

He lifted her into the saddle and arranged her skirt brushing away the
dust

Grandpa she exclaimed softly with a long quivering sigh Im so
_happy_

Have you ever ridden Jewel

Oh yes a thousand times she answered quickly but not on a real
horse she added as an afterthought

Hm That might make a difference Mr Evringham loosed the pony
and put the white bridle in the childs hands then he led the pretty
creature down the woodland road

Im _so_ happy repeated Jewel What will mother and father say

Youll be a regular circus rider by the time they come home

As the broker spoke these words Zeke appeared around the bend in the
road riding Essex Maid His face was alight with interest in the sight
that met him

Jewel called to him radiantly Oh Zeke what do you think

I think its great he responded Hello little kid he said as he
came nearer and perceived the signs in the childs face Pony do any
harm Mr Evringham he asked with respectful concern

No Jewel cried a little but it was only because I told her she could
not sleep nights in Stars manger

The child gave one look of astonishment at the speakers grave
countenance and then shouted with a laugh as spontaneous as though no
tear had ever fallen from her shining eyes

See Essex Maid look at my pony grandpa she said joyously She looks
so proud and stuck _up_

Look away my lady said the broker Youll see a great deal more of
this young spring before you see less

Zeke dismounted

Now then Mr Evringham looked up at the child Im going to let go
your bridle

I want you to she answered gayly

Mr Evringham mounted his horse Well take a sedate walk through the
woods he said Zeke you might lead her a little way

No no _please_ begged the child I know how to ride I _do_

Well let her go then smiled the broker and Essex Maid trotted
slowly noting with haughty bright eyes the little black companion
who might have stepped out of a picture book but whose easy canter was
tossing Jewel at every step

I haventanywhip The words were bounced out of the childs lips
and Mr Evringhams laugh resounded along the avenue

I believe shed use it he said to Zeke who was running along beside
the black pony

I guess she would sir grinned the young fellow responsively

It was not many days before Jewel had learned to stay in the saddle She
had an efficient teacher who worked with her _con amore_ and the sight
of the erect grayhaired man on his famous mare always accompanied
by the rosy little girl on a black pony came to be a familiar sight in
BelAir and one which people always turned to follow with their eyes

Eloise had her talk with Mr Evringham one evening when Jewel was
excluded from the library and she emerged from the interview with a
more contented heart than she had known for a year

She endeavored to convey the situation to her mother in detail but when
that lady had learned that there were no happy surprises she declined
to listen

Tastes differ Eloise she said I am one who believes that where
ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise Mrs Evringham had regained a
quite lighthearted appearance in the interest of expending a portion of
her windfall on her own and Eloises summer wardrobe

Well you shant be bothered then returned her daughter You have me
to take care of our money matters

I prefer to let father do it returned Mrs Evringham decidedly He
is a changed being of late and we are as well situated as we could hope
to be I dont feel quite satisfied with the lining of the brougham but
some day I mean to speak of it

Eloise threw up both hands but she laughed She and her grandfather had
an excellent understanding and she knew that the mills of the gods were
about to grind

One evening the broker called his daughterinlaw into the library

I hope it isnt on business she remarked flippantly as she entered
I tell you right at the start father I cant understand it Her eyes
wandered about the room curiously It was strange to her She took up a
womans picture from the desk Who is this she asked

How do you like the face he returned

The dark eyes and sweet mouth looked back at her She frowned slightly
She did not like the situation in which she had found the photograph It
was far too intimate for a stranger and made her a little nervous

If he is going to marry again then goodby indeed she thought

I think it is rather sentimental she returned with an air of
engaging candor dont you Just my first impression you know but
its a face I shouldnt trust Who is it

It is Jewels mother returned the broker quietly my daughter Julia
Jewel brought it down last night also a lot of little letters her
mother had put in the pockets of the childs dresses when she packed
them

Ah exclaimed Mrs Evringham triumphantly Didnt I say she was
sentimental About that sort of thing my perceptions are always so
keen

Hm I read the letters and I judged from them that one can trust her
Will you be seated He placed a chair I should like to ask your plans
for the summer

Mrs Evringham looked up quickly startled Oh I havent any Have
you

Yes I always seek some cool spot You have an invitation to View
Point I understand You could scarcely do better

I have reasons father impressively reasons for declining that

Then where are you going

I would just as lief stay here and take care of your house as not
declared the lady magnanimously

Ha Without any servants

Why what do you mean

They are going away for a vacation I am intending to have the house
wired and Mrs Forbes and Zeke will hold sway in the barn She doesnt
wish to leave him

Mrs Evringham was silenced and dismayed She felt herself being firmly
and inexorably pushed out of this welllined nest

Her eyes fell before the impenetrable ones regarding her

How did Jewel ever win him she thought The picturesque pony with
his arched neck and expensive trappings had outraged her feelings for
days

About the View Point plan continued Mr Evringham deliberately
I think there are influences waiting for you there that will be of
benefit There is a new philosophy percolating in these days through our
worldly rubbish which you and I would be the better for grasping Your
chances are better than mine for you are young still Your daughter is
expanding like a flower already in the first rays of her understanding
of it This young man whom you fancy you can avoid is a help to her Mr
Reeves was talking to me about him last night He says that so far as
his business is concerned young Bonnell is proving the square peg in
the square hole I dont know what Eloises sentiments are toward him
but I do know that she shall be independent of any ones financial help
but mine

Mrs Evringham lifted her eyes hopefully

I shall eke out the little income which is left to you with sufficient
for you to livenot as you have donebut comfortably

The eager light faded from his listeners eyes

Eloise and I have arranged that he continued and she is satisfied
Take my advice Madge Go to View Point

I suppose Eloise doesnt need horses so long as Jewel has them said
Mrs Evringham rising

Her host followed her example She thinks not he returned concisely
then he opened the library door and his daughterinlaw swept from his
presence with all the dignity she could muster



CHAPTER XXVIII

AT TWILIGHT

It was Sunday and Mr Bonnell was dining at BelAir Park Had Jewel
thought of it she might have contrasted the expression of Mrs Forbess
face as she waited at table this evening with the look it wore on the
day she first arrived might have noted the cheerful flow of talk which
enlivened the board in distinction from the stiff silence or bitter
repartee which once chilled her As she responded to the smiles hovering
now about Eloises lovely lips she might have remembered the once
sombre sadness of those eyes Even Mrs Evringham had buried
the Macbethian dagger and wore the meek and patient air of one
misunderstood but nothing would have amazed the child so much as to be
told that she had had anything to do with this metamorphosis

Anna Belledeserted often now perforce on account of the pony
whose life was a strenuous one owing to the variety of Jewels
attentionsAnna Belle was petted with extra fondness when her turn
came and she sat at table now in a pleasing trance her smile an
impartial benediction upon all

It had been a glorious June day the park was at its best After dinner
the family strolled out toward the piazza

Mrs Forbes had attended her own Baptist church that morning and the
familiar Sundayschool tune that the children sang floated through her
mind as she looked after the group

 When He cometh when He cometh
 To make up His jewels
 All His pure ones all His bright ones
 His loved and His own

 Little children little children
 Who love their Redeemer
 Are the jewels precious jewels
 His loved and His own

What is Mr Evringham going to do without that child she thought

The broker was invaded with the same problem as Jewel lingered with
him on the piazza while the others walked on toward a seat beneath a
spreading maple

He ensconced himself in his favorite chair The thrushes were singing
vespers The pure air was faintly and deliciously scented

Grandpa is it too late to bring Star out for a nibble asked the
little girl wistfully

No I guess not returned the broker as he opened his cigar case
Star may have a short life but hes certainly experiencing a merry
one Theres no moss gathering on that pony

Jewel had not waited for more than the permission She was fleeing
toward the barn

Mr Evringham lighted his cigar and then his eye fell upon the doll
too hastily set down and fallen at a distressing angle Her eyes were
closed as if her sensibilities had been shocked overmuch

Anna Belle Anna Belle has it come to this he murmured picking
up the neglected one who with her usual elasticity and exuberance
of spirit at once opened her eyes and beamed optimistically on her
rescuer He set her facing him on his knee Such is youth he
sighed When she throws you down I feel that Im not going to be
so recuperative as you Anna Belle I have a plan however a plan of
selfdefense but if it werent for your discretion I shouldnt tell it
to you for Im an old bird young lady and cant be caught with chaff
There are many worthy persons who may rise to lofty heights in eternity
who nevertheless meanwhile are not desirable to sit opposite a man at
his breakfast table A visit Anna Belle a short visit from my daughter
Julia is all I shall ask for at first and I shall test her test her
my dear Ill look at her through a magnifying glass Of course if
theyd give me Jewel it would be all Id ask for but they wont That
is selfevident

Here the child came around the corner of the house leading her pet by a
halter but with her hand in his mane as she pressed close to his side
caressing and talking to him In fact it was the harassing problem of
the ponys life to manage to avoid stepping on her Zeke lounged in the
background on account equally of his orders and his inclination

Star began cropping the grass and Mr Evringham continued his
disquisition to the brighteyed young person on his knee

My son Harry is turning out a pretty good sort I fancy Im not
particularly shy of giving him a trial provided hell do the same by
me but I suppose he will have to go West at first anyway Julia is a
different thing I cant whistle her on and off with the same frankness
and I must be careful Anna Belle Do you understand Careful And Im
going to be by Jove in spite of the way it makes me cringe to think
of this big house empty as a drum It wasnt empty before thats the
mischief of it What has happened to me I thought things were well
enough in those days Nobody whom I knew was particularly happy Why
should I be

The thrushes stopped for Jewels childish voice floated out on the
evening air

Mr Evringham knew what had happened He knew that Zeke had asked her to
sing They two were sitting on the ground while the pony cropped away
at the sweet grass

 From tired joy and grief afar
 And nearer Thee
 Father where Thine own children are
 I love to be

The broker listened for a minute

Ill take Jewel and her mother to the seashore somewhere for I must
leave the house if only to let Madge down easily and too I wish to
study Julia outside her atmosphere Poor Madge shes a light weight
but I think there are better times coming for her At View Point shell
find friends

Time passed and at last Mr Evringham called That will do Jewel

Do you want Star to go in she returned

The broker nodded and the child sprang up and began patting and
smoothing the little horse with energetic affection

Its your bedtime Star she said but mornings coming She kissed
his sleek shoulder Well have such a good time in the morning I dont
bounce a bit now do I Zeke she asked turning to him

Well I guess not returned Zeke scornfully You aint the kind that
gets bounced after a fellow knows you he added smiling He took the
ponys halter Goodnight Jewel

Goodnight Zeke She ran across the lawn and up the piazza steps
How kind of you grandpa to amuse Anna Belle she exclaimed
gratefully observing the doll on his knee At the same time she most
abruptly whisked that patient person into a neighboring chair and
usurped her place Cuddling down in her grandfathers arms she nestled
her head against his shoulder and sighed happily

The light began to fade the last smoke from the brokers cigar curled
out into the summer air He tossed it away and pressed the child more
closely to him

Sing once again the song you sang for Zeke he said

And she began softly in her true clear voice

 From tired joy and grief afar
 And nearer Thee
 Father where Thine own children are
 I love to be

Amen breathed Mr Evringham

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate
