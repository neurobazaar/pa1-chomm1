INTRODUCTION



The Peace was brought out four years after The Acharnians 422
BC when the War had already lasted ten years The leading motive is
the same as in the former playthe intense desire of the less excitable
and more moderateminded citizens for relief from the miseries of war

Trygaeus a rustic patriot finding no help in men resolves to ascend
to heaven to expostulate personally with Zeus for allowing this wretched
state of things to continue With this object he has fed and trained a
gigantic dungbeetle which he mounts and is carried like Bellerophon
on Pegasus on an aerial journey Eventually he reaches Olympus only to
find that the gods have gone elsewhere and that the heavenly abode is
occupied solely by the demon of War who is busy pounding up the Greek
States in a huge mortar However his benevolent purpose is not in vain
for learning from Hermes that the goddess Peace has been cast into a
pit where she is kept a fast prisoner he calls upon the different
peoples of Hellas to make a united effort and rescue her and with their
help drags her out and brings her back in triumph to earth The play
concludes with the restoration of the goddess to her ancient honours
the festivities of the rustic population and the nuptials of Trygaeus
with Opora Harvest handmaiden of Peace represented as a pretty
courtesan

Such references as there are to Cleon in this play are noteworthy The
great Demagogue was now dead having fallen in the same action as the
rival Spartan general the renowned Brasidas before Amphipolis and
whatever Aristophanes says here of his old enemy is conceived in the
spirit of de mortuis nil nisi bonum In one scene Hermes is descanting
on the evils which had nearly ruined Athens and declares that The
Tanner was the cause of them all But Trygaeus interrupts him with the
words

Holdsay not so good master Hermes Let the man rest in peace where
now he lies He is no longer of our world but yours

Here surely we have a trait of magnanimity on the authors part as
admirable in its way as the wit and boldness of his former attacks had
been in theirs

SCENE A farmyard two slaves busy beside a dungheap afterwards in
Olympus



FIRST SERVANT Quick quick bring the dungbeetle his cake

SECOND SERVANT Coming coming

FIRST SERVANT Give it to him and may it kill him

SECOND SERVANT May he never eat a better

FIRST SERVANT Now give him this other one kneaded up with asss dung

SECOND SERVANT There Ive done that too

FIRST SERVANT And wheres what you gave him just now surely he cant
have devoured it yet

SECOND SERVANT Indeed he has he snatched it rolled it between his feet
and bolted it

FIRST SERVANT Come hurry up knead up a lot and knead them stiffly

SECOND SERVANT Oh scavengers help me in the name of the gods if you
do not wish to see me fall down choked

FIRST SERVANT Come come another made from the stool of a young
scapegrace catamite Twill be to the beetles taste he likes it well
ground

SECOND SERVANT There I am free at least from suspicion none will
accuse me of tasting what I mix

FIRST SERVANT Faugh come now another keep on mixing with all your
might

SECOND SERVANT I faith no I can stand this awful cesspool stench no
longer so I bring you the whole illsmelling gear

FIRST SERVANT Pitch it down the sewer sooner and yourself with it

SECOND SERVANT Maybe one of you can tell me where I can buy a
stoppedup nose for there is no work more disgusting than to mix food
for a beetle and to carry it to him A pig or a dog will at least pounce
upon our excrement without more ado but this foul wretch affects the
disdainful the spoilt mistress and wont eat unless I offer him a cake
that has been kneaded for an entire day But let us open the door
a bit ajar without his seeing it Has he done eating Come pluck up
courage cram yourself till you burst The cursed creature It wallows
in its food It grips it between its claws like a wrestler clutching
his opponent and with head and feet together rolls up its paste like
a ropemaker twisting a hawser What an indecent stinking gluttonous
beast I know not what angry god let this monster loose upon us but of
a certainty it was neither Aphrodite nor the Graces

FIRST SERVANT Who was it then

SECOND SERVANT No doubt the Thunderer Zeus

FIRST SERVANT But perhaps some spectator some beardless youth who
thinks himself a sage will say What is this What does the beetle
mean And then an Ionian1 sitting next him will add I think
tis an allusion to Cleon who so shamelessly feeds on filth all by
himselfBut now Im going indoors to fetch the beetle a drink

 f1 Peace was no doubt produced at the festival of the
 Apaturia which was kept at the end of October a period
 when strangers were numerous in Athens

SECOND SERVANT As for me I will explain the matter to you all
children youths grownups and old men aye even to the decrepit
dotards My master is mad not as you are but with another sort of
madness quite a new kind The livelong day he looks openmouthed
towards heaven and never stops addressing Zeus Ah Zeus he cries
what are thy intentions Lay aside thy besom do not sweep Greece
away

TRYGAEUS Ah ah ah

SECOND SERVANT Hush hush Mehinks I hear his voice

TRYGAEUS Oh Zeus what art thou going to do for our people Dost thou
not see this that our cities will soon be but empty husks

SECOND SERVANT As I told you that is his form of madness There you
have a sample of his follies When his trouble first began to seize him
he said to himself By what means could I go straight to Zeus Then
he made himself very slender little ladders and so clambered up towards
heaven but he soon came hurtling down again and broke his head
Yesterday to our misfortune he went out and brought us back this
thoroughbred but from where I know not this great beetle whose groom
he has forced me to become He himself caresses it as though it were
a horse saying Oh my little Pegasus1 my noble aerial steed may
your wings soon bear me straight to Zeus But what is my master doing
I must stoop down to look through this hole Oh great gods Here
neighbours run here quick here is my master flying off mounted on his
beetle as if on horseback

 f1 The winged steed of Perseusan allusion to a lost
 tragedy of Euripides in which Bellerophon was introduced
 riding on Pegasus

TRYGAEUS Gently gently go easy beetle dont start off so proudly or
trust at first too greatly to your powers wait till you have sweated
till the beating of your wings shall make your limb joints supple Above
all things dont let off some foul smell I adjure you else I would
rather have you stop in the stable altogether

SECOND SERVANT Poor master Is he crazy

TRYGAEUS Silence silence

SECOND SERVANT TO TRYGAEUS But why start up into the air on chance

TRYGAEUS Tis for the weal of all the Greeks I am attempting a daring
and novel feat

SECOND SERVANT But what is your purpose What useless folly

TRYGAEUS No words of ill omen Give vent to joy and command all men to
keep silence to close down their drains and privies with new tiles and
to stop up their own ventholes1

 f1 Fearing that if it caught a whiff from earth to its
 liking the beetle might descend from the highest heaven to
 satisfy itself

FIRST SERVANT No I shall not be silent unless you tell me where you
are going

TRYGAEUS Why where am I likely to be going across the sky if it be not
to visit Zeus

FIRST SERVANT For what purpose

TRYGAEUS I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks

SECOND SERVANT And if he doesnt tell you

TRYGAEUS I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the
Medes1

 f1 The Persians and the Spartans were not then allied as
 the scholiast states since a treaty between them was only
 concluded in 412 BC ie eight years after the production
 of Peace the great king however was trying to derive
 advantages out of the dissensions in Greece

SECOND SERVANT Death seize me if I let you go

TRYGAEUS It is absolutely necessary

SECOND SERVANT Alas alas dear little girls your father is deserting
you secretly to go to heaven Ah poor orphans entreat him beseech
him

LITTLE DAUGHTER Father father what is this I hear Is it true What
you would leave me you would vanish into the sky you would go to the
crows1 Tis impossible Answer father an you love me

 f1 Go to the crows a proverbial expression equivalent
 to our Go to the devil

TRYGAEUS Yes I am going You hurt me too sorely my daughters when you
ask me for bread calling me your daddy and there is not the ghost
of an obolus in the house if I succeed and come back you will have a
barley loaf every morningand a punch in the eye for sauce

LITTLE DAUGHTER But how will you make the journey Tis not a ship that
will carry you thither

TRYGAEUS No but this winged steed will

LITTLE DAUGHTER But what an idea daddy to harness a beetle on which
to fly to the gods

TRYGAEUS We see from Aesops fables that they alone can fly to the abode
of the Immortals1

 f1 Aesop tells us that the eagle and the beetle were at
 war the eagle devoured the beetles young and the latter
 got into its nest and tumbled out its eggs On this the
 eagle complained to Zeus who advised it to lay its eggs in
 his bosom but the beetle flew up to the abode of Zeus who
 forgetful of the eagles eggs at once rose to chase off the
 objectionable insect The eggs fell to earth and were
 smashed to bits

LITTLE DAUGHTER Father father tis a tale nobody can believe that
such a stinking creature can have gone to the gods

TRYGAEUS It went to have vengeance on the eagle and break its eggs

LITTLE DAUGHTER Why not saddle Pegasus you would have a more TRAGIC1
appearance in the eyes of the gods

 f1 Pegasus is introduced by Euripides both in his
 Andromeda and his Bellerophon

TRYGAEUS Eh dont you see little fool that then twice the food would
be wanted Whereas my beetle devours again as filth what I have eaten
myself

LITTLE DAUGHTER And if it fell into the watery depths of the sea could
it escape with its wings

TRYGAEUS EXPOSING HIMSELF I am fitted with a rudder in case of need
and my Naxos beetle will serve me as a boat1

 f1 Boats called beetles doubtless because in form they
 resembled these insects were built at Naxos

LITTLE DAUGHTER And what harbour will you put in at

TRYGAEUS Why is there not the harbour of Cantharos at the Piraeus1

 f1 Nature had divided the Piraeus into three basins
 Cantharos Aphrodisium and Zea Cantharos is Greek for
 dungbeetle

LITTLE DAUGHTER Take care not to knock against anything and so fall off
into space once a cripple you would be a fit subject for Euripides
who would put you into a tragedy1

 f1 In allusion to Euripides fondness for introducing lame
 heroes in his plays

TRYGAEUS Ill see to it Goodbye TO THE ATHENIANS You for love of
whom I brave these dangers do ye neither let wind nor go to stool
for the space of three days for if while cleaving the air my steed
should scent anything he would fling me head foremost from the summit
of my hopes Now come my Pegasus get agoing with uppricked ears and
make your golden bridle resound gaily Eh what are you doing What are
you up to Do you turn your nose towards the cesspools Come pluck up
a spirit rush upwards from the earth stretch out your speedy wings and
make straight for the palace of Zeus for once give up foraging in your
daily foodHi you down there what are you after now Oh my god
tis a man emptying his belly in the Piraeus close to the house where
the bad girls are But is it my death you seek then my death Will
you not bury that right away and pile a great heap of earth upon it and
plant wild thyme therein and pour perfumes on it If I were to fall from
up here and misfortune happened to me the town of Chios1 would owe a
fine of five talents for my death all along of your cursed rump Alas
how frightened I am oh I have no heart for jests Ah machinist take
great care of me There is already a wind whirling round my navel take
great care or from sheer fright I shall form food for my beetle
But I think I am no longer far from the gods aye that is the dwelling
of Zeus I perceive Hullo Hi where is the doorkeeper Will no one
open

 f1 An allusion to the proverbial nickname applied to the
 Chians in Greekcrapping Chian There is a further
 joke of course in connection with the hundred and one
 frivolous pretexts which the Athenians invented for exacting
 contributions from the maritime allies

THE SCENE CHANGES AND HEAVEN IS PRESENTED

HERMES Meseems I can sniff a man HE PERCEIVES TRYGAEUS ASTRIDE HIS
BEETLE Why what plague is this

TRYGAEUS A horsebeetle

HERMES Oh impudent shameless rascal oh scoundrel triple scoundrel
the greatest scoundrel in the world how did you come here Oh
scoundrel of all scoundrels your name Reply

TRYGAEUS Triple scoundrel

HERMES Your country

TRYGAEUS Triple scoundrel

HERMES Your father

TRYGAEUS My father Triple scoundrel

HERMES By the Earth you shall die unless you tell me your name

TRYGAEUS I am Trygaeus of the Athmonian deme a good vinedresser
little addicted to quibbling and not at all an informer

HERMES Why do you come

TRYGAEUS I come to bring you this meat

HERMES Ah my good friend did you have a good journey

TRYGAEUS Glutton be off I no longer seem a triple scoundrel to you
Come call Zeus

HERMES Ah ah you are a long way yet from reaching the gods for they
moved yesterday

TRYGAEUS To what part of the earth

HERMES Eh of the earth did you say

TRYGAEUS In short where are they then

HERMES Very far very far right at the furthest end of the dome of
heaven

TRYGAEUS But why have they left you all alone here

HERMES I am watching what remains of the furniture the little pots and
pans the bits of chairs and tables and odd winejars

TRYGAEUS And why have the gods moved away

HERMES Because of their wrath against the Greeks They have located War
in the house they occupied themselves and have given him full power to
do with you exactly as he pleases then they went as high up as ever
they could so as to see no more of your fights and to hear no more of
your prayers

TRYGAEUS What reason have they for treating us so

HERMES Because they have afforded you an opportunity for peace more than
once but you have always preferred war If the Laconians got the very
slightest advantage they would exclaim By the Twin Brethren the
Athenians shall smart for this If on the contrary the latter
triumphed and the Laconians came with peace proposals you would say
By Demeter they want to deceive us No by Zeus we will not hear a
word they will always be coming as long as we hold Pylos1

 f1 Masters of Pylos and Sphacteria the Athenians had
 brought home the three hundred prisoners taken in the latter
 place in 425 BC the Spartans had several times sent
 envoys to offer peace and to demand back both Pylos and the
 prisoners but the Athenian pride had caused these proposals
 to be long refused Finally the prisoners had been given up
 in 423 BC but the War was continued nevertheless

TRYGAEUS Yes that is quite the style our folk do talk in

HERMES So that I dont know whether you will ever see Peace again

TRYGAEUS Why where has she gone to then

HERMES War has cast her into a deep pit

TRYGAEUS Where

HERMES Down there at the very bottom And you see what heaps of stones
he has piled over the top so that you should never pull her out again

TRYGAEUS Tell me what is War preparing against us

HERMES All I know is that last evening he brought along a huge mortar

TRYGAEUS And what is he going to do with his mortar

HERMES He wants to pound up all the cities of Greece in it But I
must say goodbye for I think he is coming out what an uproar he is
making

TRYGAEUS Ah great gods let us seek safety meseems I already hear the
noise of this fearful war mortar

WAR ENTERS CARRYING A HUGE MORTAR Oh mortals mortals wretched
mortals how your jaws will snap

TRYGAEUS Oh divine Apollo what a prodigious big mortar Oh what
misery the very sight of War causes me This then is the foe from whom I
fly who is so cruel so formidable so stalwart so solid on his legs

WAR Oh Prasiae1 thrice wretched five times aye a thousand times
wretched for thou shalt be destroyed this day

 f1 An important town in Eastern Laconia on the Argolic
 gulf celebrated for a temple where a festival was held
 annually in honour of Achilles It had been taken and
 pillaged by the Athenians in the second year of the
 Peloponnesian War 430 BC As he utters this imprecation
 War throws some leeks the rootword of the name Praisae
 into his mortar

TRYGAEUS This does not concern us over much tis only so much the worse
for the Laconians

WAR Oh Megara Megara how utterly are you going to be ground up what
fine mincemeat1 are you to be made into

 f1 War throws some garlic into his mortar as emblematical
 of the city of Megara where it was grown in abundance

TRYGAEUS Alas alas what bitter tears there will be among the
Megarians1

 f1 Because the smell of bruised garlic causes the eyes to
 water

WAR Oh Sicily you too must perish Your wretched towns shall be
grated like this cheese1 Now let us pour some Attic honey2 into the
mortar

 f1 He throws cheese into the mortar as emblematical of
 Sicily on account of its rich pastures

 f2 Emblematical of Athens They honey of Mount Hymettus
 was famous

TRYGAEUS Oh I beseech you use some other honey this kind is worth
four obols be careful oh be careful of our Attic honey

WAR Hi Tumult you slave there

TUMULT What do you want

WAR Out upon you Standing there with folded arms Take this cuff o the
head for your pains

TUMULT Oh how it stings Master have you got garlic in your fist I
wonder

WAR Run and fetch me a pestle

TUMULT But we havent got one twas only yesterday we moved

WAR Go and fetch me one from Athens and hurry hurry

TUMULT Aye I hasten there if I return without one I shall have no
cause for laughing EXIT

TRYGAEUS Ah what is to become of us wretched mortals that we are See
the danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle for War will
quietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces
Ah Bacchus cause this herald of evil to perish on his road

WAR Well

TUMULT WHO HAS RETURNED Well what

WAR You have brought back nothing

TUMULT Alas the Athenians have lost their pestlethe tanner who
ground Greece to powder1

 f1 Cleon who had lately fallen before Amphipolis in 422
 BC

TRYGAEUS Oh Athene venerable mistress tis well for our city he is
dead and before he could serve us with this hash

WAR Then go and seek one at Sparta and have done with it

TUMULT Aye aye master

WAR Be back as quick as ever you can

TRYGAEUS TO THE AUDIENCE What is going to happen friends Tis the
critical hour Ah if there is some initiate of Samothrace1 among you
tis surely the moment to wish this messenger some accidentsome sprain
or strain

 f1 An island in the Aegean Sea on the coast of Thrace and
 opposite the mouth of the Hebrus the Mysteries are said to
 have found their first home in this island where the
 Cabirian gods were worshipped this cult shrouded in deep
 mystery to even the initiates themselves has remained an
 almost insoluble problem for the modern critic It was said
 that the wishes of the initiates were always granted and
 they were feared as today the jettatori spellthrowers
 casters of the evil eye in Sicily are feared

TUMULT WHO RETURNS Alas alas thrice again alas

WAR What is it Again you come back without it

TUMULT The Spartans too have lost their pestle

WAR How varlet

TUMULT They had lent it to their allies in Thrace1 who have lost it
for them

 f1 Brasidas perished in Thrace in the same battle as Cleon
 at Amphipolis 422 BC

TRYGAEUS Long life to you Thracians My hopes revive pluck up courage
mortals

WAR Take all this stuff away I am going in to make a pestle for myself

TRYGAEUS Tis now the time to sing as Datis did as he abused himself
at high noon Oh pleasure oh enjoyment oh delights Tis now oh
Greeks the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting we should rescue
sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit before some other pestle
prevents us Come labourers merchants workmen artisans strangers
whether you be domiciled or not islanders come here Greeks of all
countries come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes Tis the
moment to drain a cup in honour of the Good Genius

CHORUS Come hither all quick hasten to the rescue All peoples of
Greece now is the time or never for you to help each other You see
yourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed The
day hateful to Lamachus1 has come Come then what must be done
Give your orders direct us for I swear to work this day without
ceasing until with the help of our levers and our engines we have drawn
back into light the greatest of all goddesses her to whom the olive is
so dear

 f1 An Athenian general as ambitious as he was brave In
 423 BC he had failed in an enterprise against Heracles a
 storm having destroyed his fleet Since then he had
 distingued himself in several actions and was destined
 some years later to share the command of the expedition to
 Sicily with Alcibiades and Nicias

TRYGAEUS Silence if War should hear your shouts of joy he would bound
forth from his retreat in fury

CHORUS Such a decree overwhelms us with joy how different to the edict
which bade us muster with provisions for three days1

 f1 Meaning to start a military expedition

TRYGAEUS Let us beware lest the cursed Cerberus1 prevent us even from
the nethermost hell from delivering the goddess by his furious howling
just as he did when on earth

 f1 Cleon

CHORUS Once we have hold of her none in the world will be able to take
her from us Huzza huzza1

 f1 The Chorus insist on the conventional choric dance

TRYGAEUS You will work my death if you dont subdue your shouts War
will come running out and trample everything beneath his feet

CHORUS Well then LET him confound let him trample let him overturn
everything We cannot help giving vent to our joy

TRYGAEUS Oh cruel fate My friends in the name of the gods
what possesses you Your dancing will wreck the success of a fine
undertaking

CHORUS Tis not I who want to dance tis my legs that bound with
delight

TRYGAEUS Enough an you love me cease your gambols

CHORUS There Tis over

TRYGAEUS You say so and nevertheless you go on

CHORUS Yet one more figure and tis done

TRYGAEUS Well just this one then you must dance no more

CHORUS No no more dancing if we can help you

TRYGAEUS But look you are not stopping even now

CHORUS By Zeus I am only throwing up my right leg thats all

TRYGAEUS Come I grant you that but pray annoy me no further

CHORUS Ah the left leg too will have its fling well tis but its
right I am so happy so delighted at not having to carry my buckler
any more I sing and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age as a
serpent does its skin

TRYGAEUS No tis not time for joy yet for you are not sure of success
But when you have got the goddess then rejoice shout and laugh
thenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home to make love or
sleep to attend festivals and processions to play at cottabos1 live
like true Sybarites and to shout Io io

 f1 One of the most favourite games with the Greeks A
 stick was set upright in the ground and to this the beam of
 a balance was attached by its centre Two vessels were hung
 from the extremities of the beam so as to balance beneath
 these two other and larger dishes were placed and filled
 with water and in the middle of each a brazen figure
 called Manes was stood The game consisted in throwing
 drops of wine from an agreed distance into one or the other
 vessel so that dragged downwards by the weight of the
 liquor it bumped against Manes

CHORUS Ah God grant we may see the blessed day I have suffered so
much have so oft slept with Phormio1 on hard beds You will no longer
find me an acid angry hard judge as heretofore but will find me
turned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness We
have been killing ourselves long enough tiring ourselves out with going
to the Lyceum2 and returning laden with spear and bucklerBut what
can we do to please you Come speak for tis a good Fate that has
named you our leader

 f1 A general of austere habits he disposed of all his
 property to pay the cost of a naval expedition in which he
 beat the fleet of the foe off the promontory of Rhium in 429
 BC

 f2 The Lyceum was a portico ornamented with paintings and
 surrounded with gardens in which military exercises took
 place

TRYGAEUS How shall we set about removing these stones

HERMES Rash reprobate what do you propose doing

TRYGAEUS Nothing bad as Cillicon said1

 f1 A citizen of Miletus who betrayed his country to the
 people of Pirene When asked what he purposed he replied
 Nothing bad which expression had therefore passed into a
 proverb

HERMES You are undone you wretch

TRYGAEUS Yes if the lot had to decide my life for Hermes would know
how to turn the chance1

 f1 Hermes was the god of chance

HERMES You are lost you are dead

TRYGAEUS On what day

HERMES This instant

TRYGAEUS But I have not provided myself with flour and cheese yet1 to
start for death

 f1 As the soldiers had to do when starting on an
 expedition

HERMES You ARE kneaded and ground already I tell you1

 f1 That is you are predicated

TRYGAEUS Hah I have not yet tasted that gentle pleasure

HERMES Dont you know that Zeus has decreed death for him who is
surprised exhuming Peace

TRYGAEUS What must I really and truly die

HERMES You must

TRYGAEUS Well then lend me three drachmae to buy a young pig I wish to
have myself initiated before I die1

 f1 The initiated were thought to enjoy greater happiness
 after death

HERMES Oh Zeus the Thunderer1

 f1 He summons Zeus to reveal Trygaeus conspiracy

TRYGAEUS I adjure you in the name of the gods master dont denounce
us

HERMES I may not I cannot keep silent

TRYGAEUS In the name of the meats which I brought you so goodnaturedly

HERMES Why wretched man Zeus will annihilate me if I do not shout out
at the top of my voice to inform him what you are plotting

TRYGAEUS Oh no dont shout I beg you dear little Hermes And what
are you doing comrades You stand there as though you were stocks and
stones Wretched men speak entreat him at once otherwise he will be
shouting

CHORUS Oh mighty Hermes dont do it no dont do it If ever you have
eaten some young pig sacrificed by us on your altars with pleasure
may this offering not be without value in your sight today

TRYGAEUS Do you not hear them wheedling you mighty god

CHORUS Be not pitiless toward our prayers permit us to deliver
the goddess Oh the most human the most generous of the gods be
favourable toward us if it be true that you detest the haughty crests
and proud brows of Pisander1 we shall never cease oh master
offering you sacred victims and solemn prayers

 f1 An Athenian captain who later had the recall of
 Alcibiades decreed by the Athenian people in The Birds
 Aristophanes represents him as a cowardly beggar He was
 the reactionary leader who established the Oligarchical
 Government of the Four Hundred 411 BC after the failure
 of the Syracusan expedition

TRYGAEUS Have mercy mercy let yourself be touched by their words
never was your worship so dear to them as today

HERMES I truth never have you been greater thieves1

 f1 Among other attributes Hermes was the god of thieves

TRYGAEUS I will reveal a great a terrible conspiracy against the gods
to you

HERMES Hah speak and perchance I shall let myself be softened

TRYGAEUS Know then that the Moon and that infamous Sun are plotting
against you and want to deliver Greece into the hands of the
Barbarians

HERMES What for

TRYGAEUS Because it is to you that we sacrifice whereas the barbarians
worship them hence they would like to see you destroyed that they
alone might receive the offerings

HERMES Tis then for this reason that these untrustworthy charioteers
have for so long been defrauding us one of them robbing us of daylight
and the other nibbling away at the others disk1

 f1 Alluding to the eclipses of the sun and the moon

TRYGAEUS Yes certainly So therefore Hermes my friend help us with
your whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate
the great Panathenaea1 in your honour as well as all the festivals
of the other gods for Hermes shall be the Mysteries the Dipolia the
Adonia everywhere the towns freed from their miseries will sacrifice
to Hermes the Liberator you will be loaded with benefits of every kind
and to start with I offer you this cup for libations as your first
present

 f1 The Panathenaea were dedicated to Athene the Mysteries
 to Demeter the Dipolia to Zeus the Adonia to Aphrodite and
 Adonis Trygaeus promises Hermes that he shall be worshipped
 in the place of the other gods

HERMES Ah how golden cups do influence me Come friends get to work
To the pit quickly pick in hand and drag away the stones

CHORUS We go but you cleverest of all the gods supervise our labours
tell us good workman as you are what we must do we shall obey your
orders with alacrity

TRYGAEUS Quick reach me your cup and let us preface our work by
addressing prayers to the gods

HERMES Oh sacred sacred libations Keep silence oh ye people keep
silence

TRYGAEUS Let us offer our libations and our prayers so that this day
may begin an era of unalloyed happiness for Greece and that he who has
bravely pulled at the rope with us may never resume his buckler

CHORUS Aye may we pass our lives in peace caressing our mistresses and
poking the fire

TRYGAEUS May he who would prefer the war oh Dionysus be ever drawing
barbed arrows out of his elbows

HERMES If there be a citizen greedy for military rank and honours who
refuses oh divine Peace to restore you to daylight may he behave as
cowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield

TRYGAEUS If a lancemaker or a dealer in shields desires war for the
sake of better trade may he be taken by pirates and eat nothing but
barley

CHORUS If some ambitious man does not help us because he wants to
become a General or if a slave is plotting to pass over to the enemy
let his limbs be broken on the wheel may he be beaten to death with
rods As for us may Fortune favour us Io Paean Io

TRYGAEUS Dont say Paean1 but simply Io

 f1 The pun here cannot be kept The word in Greek
 Paean resembles that for to strike hence the word as
 recalling the blows and wounds of the war seems of ill omen
 to Trygaeus

HERMES Very well then Io Io Ill simply say Io

TRYGAEUS To Hermes the Graces Hora Aphrodite Eros

CHORUS But not to Ares

TRYGAEUS No

CHORUS Nor doubtless to Enyalius

TRYGAEUS No

CHORUS Come all strain at the ropes to tear away the stones Pull

HERMES Heave away heave heave oh

CHORUS Come pull harder harder

HERMES Heave away heave heave oh

CHORUS Still harder harder still

HERMES Heave away heave Heave away heave heave oh

TRYGAEUS Come come there is no working together Come all pull at the
same instant you Boeotians are only pretending Beware

HERMES Come heave away heave

CHORUS Hi you two pull as well

TRYGAEUS Why I am pulling I am hanging on to the rope and straining
till I am almost off my feet I am working with all my might

CHORUS Why does not the work advance then

TRYGAEUS Lamachus this is too bad You are in the way sitting there
We have no use for your Medusas head friend1

 f1 The device on his shield was a Gorgons head See
 The Acharnians

HERMES But hold the Argives have not pulled the least bit they have
done nothing but laugh at us for our pains while they were getting gain
with both hands1

 f1 Both Sparta and Athens had sought the alliance of the
 Argives they had kept themselves strictly neutral and had
 received pay from both sides But the year after the
 production of The Wasps they openly joined Athens had
 attacked Epidaurus and got cut to pieces by the Spartans

TRYGAEUS Ah my dear sir the Laconians at all events pull with vigour

CHORUS But look only those among them who generally hold the
ploughtail show any zeal1 while the armourers impede them in their
efforts

 f1 These are the Spartan prisoners from Sphacteria who
 were lying in goal at Athens They were chained fast to
 large beams of wood

HERMES And the Megarians too are doing nothing yet look how they are
pulling and showing their teeth like famished curs The poor wretches
are dying of hunger1

 f1 Twas want of force not want of will They had
 suffered more than any other people from the war See The
 Acharnians

TRYGAEUS This wont do friends Come all together Everyone to the
work and with a good heart for the business

HERMES Heave away heave

TRYGAEUS Harder

HERMES Heave away heave

TRYGAEUS Come on then by heaven

HERMES Heave away heave Heave away heave

CHORUS This will never do

TRYGAEUS Is it not a shame some pull one way and others another You
Argives there beware of a thrashing

HERMES Come put your strength into it

TRYGAEUS Heave away heave

CHORUS There are many illdisposed folk among us

TRYGAEUS Do you at least who long for peace pull heartily

CHORUS But there are some who prevent us

HERMES Off to the Devil with you Megarians The goddess hates you She
recollects that you were the first to rub her the wrong way Athenians
you are not well placed for pulling There you are too busy with
lawsuits if you really want to free the goddess get down a little
towards the sea1

 f1 Meaning look chiefly to your fleet This was the
 counsel that Themistocles frequently gave the Athenians

CHORUS Come friends none but husbandmen on the rope

HERMES Ah that will do ever so much better

CHORUS He says the thing is going well Come all of you together and
with a will

TRYGAEUS Tis the husbandmen who are doing all the work

CHORUS Come then come and all together Hah hah at last there is
some unanimity in the work Dont let us give up let us redouble our
efforts There now we have it Come then all together Heave away
heave Heave away heave Heave away heave Heave away heave Heave
away heave All together PEACE IS DRAWN OUT OF THE PIT

TRYGAEUS Oh venerated goddess who givest us our grapes where am I to
find the tenthousandgallon words1 wherewith to greet thee I have
none such at home Oh hail to thee Opora2 and thee Theoria3 How
beautiful is thy face How sweet thy breath What gentle fragrance comes
from thy bosom gentle as freedom from military duty as the most dainty
perfumes

 f1 A metaphor referring to the abundant vintages that
 peace would assure

 f2 The goddess of fruits

 f3 Aristophanes personifies under this name the sacred
 ceremonies in general which peace would allow to be
 celebrated with due pomp Opora and Theoria come on the
 stage in the wake of Peace clothed and decked out as
 courtesans

HERMES Is it then a smell like a soldiers knapsack

TRYGAEUS Oh hateful soldier your hideous satchel makes me sick it
stinks like the belching of onions whereas this lovable deity has the
odour of sweet fruits of festivals of the Dionysia of the harmony of
flutes of the comic poets of the verses of Sophocles of the phrases
of Euripides

HERMES Thats a foul calumny you wretch She detests that framer of
subtleties and quibbles

TRYGAEUS of ivy of strainingbags for wine of bleating ewes of
provisionladen women hastening to the kitchen of the tipsy servant
wench of the upturned winejar and of a whole heap of other good
things

HERMES Then look how the reconciled towns chat pleasantly together how
they laugh and yet they are all cruelly mishandled their wounds are
bleeding still

TRYGAEUS But let us also scan the mien of the spectators we shall thus
find out the trade of each

HERMES Ah good gods Look at that poor crestmaker tearing at his
hair1 and at that pikemaker who has just broken wind in yon
swordcutlers face

 f1 Aristophanes has already shown us the husbandmen and
 workers in peaceful trades pulling at the rope the extricate
 Peace while the armourers hindered them by pulling the
 other way

TRYGAEUS And do you see with what pleasure this sicklemaker is making
long noses at the spearmaker

HERMES Now ask the husbandmen to be off

TRYGAEUS Listen good folk Let the husbandmen take their farming tools
and return to their fields as quick as possible but without either
sword spear or javelin All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning
for a century Come let everyone go till the earth singing the Paean

CHORUS Oh thou whom men of standing desired and who art good to
husbandmen I have gazed upon thee with delight and now I go to greet
my vines to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in
my youth

TRYGAEUS Friends let us first adore the goddess who has delivered us
from crests and Gorgons1 then let us hurry to our farms having first
bought a nice little piece of salt fish to eat in the fields

 f1 An allusion to Lamachus shield

HERMES By Posidon what a fine crew they make and dense as the crust of
a cake they are as nimble as guests on their way to a feast

TRYGAEUS See how their iron spades glitter and how beautifully their
threepronged mattocks glisten in the sun How regularly they align the
plants I also burn myself to go into the country and to turn over the
earth I have so long neglectedFriends do you remember the happy life
that Peace afforded us formerly can you recall the splendid baskets
of figs both fresh and dried the myrtles the sweet wine the violets
blooming near the spring and the olives for which we have wept so
much Worship adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings

CHORUS Hail hail thou beloved divinity thy return overwhelms us with
joy When far from thee my ardent wish to see my fields again made me
pine with regret From thee came all blessings Oh much desired Peace
thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the
earth Under thy rule we had a thousand delicious enjoyments at our
beck thou wert the husbandmans wheaten cake and his safeguard So that
our vineyards our young figtree woods and all our plantations hail
thee with delight and smile at thy coming But where was she then
I wonder all the long time she spent away from us Hermes thou
benevolent god tell us

HERMES Wise husbandmen hearken to my words if you want to know why
she was lost to you The start of our misfortunes was the exile of
Phidias1 Pericles feared he might share his illluck he mistrusted
your peevish nature and to prevent all danger to himself he threw out
that little spark the Megarian decree2 set the city aflame and blew
up the conflagration with a hurricane of war so that the smoke drew
tears from all Greeks both here and over there At the very outset of
this fire our vines were acrackle our casks knocked together3
it was beyond the power of any man to stop the disaster and Peace
disappeared

 f1 Having been commissioned to execute a statue of Athene
 Phidias was accused of having stolen part of the gold given
 him out of the public treasury for its decoration Rewarded
 for his work by calumny and banishment he resolved to make
 a finer statue than his Athene and executed one for the
 temple of Elis that of the Olympian Zeus which was
 considered one of the wonders of the world

 f2 He had issued a decree which forbade the admission of
 any Megarian on Attic soil and also all trade with that
 people The Megarians who obtained all their provisions
 from Athens were thus almost reduced to starvation

 f3 That is the vineyards were ravaged from the very
 outset of the war and this increased the animosity

TRYGAEUS That by Apollo is what no one ever told me I could not think
what connection there could be between Phidias and Peace

CHORUS Nor I I know it now This accounts for her beauty if she is
related to him There are so many things that escape us

HERMES Then when the towns subject to you saw that you were angered one
against the other and were showing each other your teeth like dogs they
hatched a thousand plots to pay you no more dues and gained over
the chief citizens of Sparta at the price of gold They being as
shamelessly greedy as they were faithless in diplomacy chased off Peace
with ignominy to let loose War Though this was profitable to them
twas the ruin of the husbandmen who were innocent of all blame for
in revenge your galleys went out to devour their figs

TRYGAEUS And twas with justice too did they not break down my black
fig tree which I had planted and dunged with my own hands

CHORUS Yes by Zeus yes twas well done the wretches broke a chest
for me with stones which held six medimni of corn

HERMES Then the rural labourers flocked into the city1 and let
themselves be bought over like the others Not having even a grapestone
to munch and longing after their figs they looked towards the
orators2 These well knew that the poor were driven to extremity and
lacked even bread but they nevertheless drove away the Goddess each
time she reappeared in answer to the wish of the country with their
loud shrieks that were as sharp as pitchforks furthermore they
attacked the wellfilled purses of the richest among our allies on the
pretence that they belonged to Brasidas party3 And then you would
tear the poor accused wretch to pieces with your teeth for the city
all pale with hunger and cowed with terror gladly snapped up any
calumny that was thrown it to devour So the strangers seeing what
terrible blows the informers dealt sealed their lips with gold They
grew rich while you alas you could only see that Greece was going to
ruin Twas the tanner who was the author of all this woe4

 f1 Driven in from the country parts by the Lacedaemonian
 invaders

 f2 The demagogues who distributed the slender dole given
 to the poor and by that means exercised undue power over
 them

 f3 Meaning the side of the Spartans

 f4 Cleon

TRYGAEUS Enough said Hermes leave that man in Hades whither he has
gone he no longer belongs to us but rather to yourself1 That he
was a cheat a braggart a calumniator when alive why nothing could be
truer but anything you might say now would be an insult to one of your
own folk Oh venerated Goddess why art thou silent

 f1 It was Hermes who conducted the souls of the dead down
 to the lower regions

HERMES And how could she speak to the spectators She is too angry at
all that they have made her suffer

TRYGAEUS At least let her speak a little to you Hermes

HERMES Tell me my dear what are your feelings with regard to them
Come you relentless foe of all bucklers speak I am listening to you
PEACE WHISPERS INTO HERMES EAR Is that your grievance against them
Yes yes I understand Hearken you folk this is her complaint She
says that after the affair of Pylos1 she came to you unbidden to
bring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by
your votes in the assembly

 f1 The Spartans had thrice offered to make peace after the
 Pylos disaster

TRYGAEUS Yes we did wrong but forgive us for our mind was then
entirely absorbed in leather1

 f1 ie dominated by Cleon

HERMES Listen again to what she has just asked me Who was her greatest
foe here and furthermore had she a friend who exerted himself to put
an end to the fighting

TRYGAEUS Her most devoted friend was Cleonymus it is undisputed

HERMES How then did Cleonymus behave in fights

TRYGAEUS Oh the bravest of warriors Only he was not born of the father
he claims he showed it quick enough in the army by throwing away his
weapons1

 f1 There is a pun here that cannot be rendered between
 the Greek for one who throws away his weapons and a
 supposititious child

HERMES There is yet another question she has just put to me Who rules
now in the rostrum

TRYGAEUS Tis Hyperbolus who now holds empire on the Pnyx TO PEACE
What now you turn away your head

HERMES She is vexed that the people should give themselves a wretch of
that kind for their chief

TRYGAEUS Oh we shall not employ him again but the people seeing
themselves without a leader took him haphazard just as a man who is
naked springs upon the first cloak he sees

HERMES She asks what will be the result of such a choice of the city

TRYGAEUS We shall be more farseeing in consequence

HERMES And why

TRYGAEUS Because he is a lampmaker Formerly we only directed our
business by groping in the dark now we shall only deliberate by
lamplight

HERMES Oh oh what questions she does order me to put to you

TRYGAEUS What are they

HERMES She wants to have news of a whole heap of oldfashioned things
she left here First of all how is Sophocles

TRYGAEUS Very well but something very strange has happened to him

HERMES What then

TRYGAEUS He has turned from Sophocles into Simonides1

 f1 Simonides was very avaricious and sold his pen to the
 highest bidder It seems that Sophocles had also started
 writing for gain

HERMES Into Simonides How so

TRYGAEUS Because though old and brokendown as he is he would put to
sea on a hurdle to gain an obolus1

 f1 ie he would recoil from no risk to turn an honest
 penny

HERMES And wise Cratinus1 is he still alive

 f1 A comic poet as well known for his love of wine as for
 his writings he died in 431 BC the first year of the
 war at the age of ninetyseven

TRYGAEUS He died about the time of the Laconian invasion

HERMES How

TRYGAEUS Of a swoon He could not bear the shock of seeing one of his
casks full of wine broken Ah what a number of other misfortunes our
city has suffered So dearest mistress nothing can now separate us
from thee

HERMES If that be so receive Opora here for a wife take her to the
country live with her and grow fine grapes together1

 f1 Opora was the goddess of fruits

TRYGAEUS Come my dear friend come and accept my kisses Tell me
Hermes my master do you think it would hurt me to love her a little
after so long an abstinence

HERMES No not if you swallow a potion of pennyroyal afterwards1 But
hasten to lead Theoria2 to the Senate twas there she lodged before

 f1 The scholiast says fruit may be eaten with impunity in
 great quantities if care is taken to drink a decoction of
 this herb afterwards

 f2 Theoria is confided to the care of the Senate because
 it was this body who named the deputies appointed to go and
 consult the oracles beyond the Attic borders to be present
 at feats and games

TRYGAEUS Oh fortunate Senate Thanks to Theoria what soups you will
swallow for the space of three days1 how you will devour meats and
cooked tripe Come farewell friend Hermes

 f1 The great festivals eg the Dionysia lasted three
 days Those in honour of the return of Peace which was so
 much desired could not last a shorter time

HERMES And to you also my dear sir may you have much happiness and
dont forget me

TRYGAEUS Come beetle home home and let us fly on a swift wing

HERMES Oh he is no longer here

TRYGAEUS Where has he gone to then

HERMES He is harnessed to the chariot of Zeus and bears the thunder
bolts

TRYGAEUS But where will the poor wretch get his food

HERMES He will eat Ganymedes ambrosia

TRYGAEUS Very well then but how am I going to descend

HERMES Oh never fear there is nothing simpler place yourself beside
the goddess

TRYGAEUS Come my pretty maidens follow me quickly there are plenty of
folk awaiting you with ready weapons

CHORUS Farewell and good luck be yours Let us begin by handing over all
this gear to the care of our servants for no place is less safe than a
theatre there is always a crowd of thieves prowling around it seeking
to find some mischief to do Come keep a good watch over all this
As for ourselves let us explain to the spectators what we have in our
minds the purpose of our play

Undoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself
in the parabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the
beadles Nevertheless oh Muse if it be right to esteem the most honest
and illustrious of our comic writers at his proper value permit our
poet to say that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown First of
all tis he who has compelled his rivals no longer to scoff at rags
or to war with lice and as for those Heracles always chewing and ever
hungry those poltroons and cheats who allow themselves to be beaten
at will he was the first to cover them with ridicule and to chase them
from the stage1 he has also dismissed that slave whom one never
failed to set aweeping before you so that his comrade might have
the chance of jeering at his stripes and might ask Wretch what has
happened to your hide Has the lash rained an army of its thongs on
you and laid your back waste After having delivered us from all these
wearisome ineptitudes and these low buffooneries he has built up for
us a great art like a palace with high towers constructed of fine
phrases great thoughts and of jokes not common on the streets
Moreover tis not obscure private persons or women that he stages in his
comedies but bold as Heracles tis the very greatest whom he attacks
undeterred by the fetid stink of leather or the threats of hearts of
mud He has the right to say I am the first ever dared to go straight
for that beast with the sharp teeth and the terrible eyes that flashed
lambent fire like those of Cynna2 surrounded by a hundred lewd
flatterers who spittlelicked him to his hearts content it had a
voice like a roaring torrent the stench of a seal a foul Lamias
testicles and the rump of a camel3

I did not recoil in horror at the sight of such a monster but fought
him relentlessly to win your deliverance and that of the Islanders Such
are the services which should be graven in your recollection and entitle
me to your thanks Yet I have not been seen frequenting the wrestling
school intoxicated with success and trying to tamper with young boys4
but I took all my theatrical gear5 and returned straight home I
pained folk but little and caused them much amusement my conscience
rebuked me for nothing Hence both grown men and youths should be on my
side and I likewise invite the bald6 to give me their votes for if I
triumph everyone will say both at table and at festivals Carry this
to the bald man give these cakes to the bald one do not grudge the
poet whose talent shines as bright as his own bare skull the share he
deserves

Oh Muse drive the War far from our city and come to preside over our
dances if you love me come and celebrate the nuptials of the gods the
banquets of us mortals and the festivals of the fortunate these are the
themes that inspire thy most poetic songs And should Carcinus come to
beg thee for admission with his sons to thy chorus refuse all traffic
with them remember they are but gelded birds storknecked dancers
mannikins about as tall as a pat of goat dung in fact machinemade
poets7 Contrary to all expectation the father has at last managed
to finish a piece but he owns himself that a cat strangled it one fine
evening8

Such are the songs9 with which the Muse with the glorious hair
inspires the able poet and which enchant the assembled populace when
the spring swallow twitters beneath the foliage10 but the god spare
us from the chorus of Morsimus and that of Melanthius11 Oh what a
bitter discordancy grated upon my ears that day when the tragic
chorus was directed by this same Melanthius and his brother these two
Gorgons12 these two harpies the plague of the seas whose gluttonous
bellies devour the entire race of fishes these followers of old women
these goats with their stinking armpits Oh Muse spit upon them
abundantly and keep the feast gaily with me

 f1 In spite of what he says Aristophanes has not always
 disdained this sort of low comedyfor instance his
 Heracles in The Birds

 f2 A celebrated Athenian courtesan of Aristophanes day

 f3 Cleon These four verses are here repeated from the
 parabasis of The Wasps produced 423 BC the year before
 this play

 f4 Shafts aimed at certain poets who used their renown as
 a means of seducing young men to grant them pederastic
 favours

 f5 The poet supplied everything needful for the production
 of his piecevases dresses masks etc

 f6 Aristophanes was bald himself it would seem

 f7 Carcinus and his three sons were both poets and
 dancers See the closing scene of The Wasps Perhaps
 relying little on the literary value of their work it seems
 that they sought to please the people by the magnificence of
 its staging

 f8 He had written a piece called The Mice which he
 succeeded with great difficulty in getting played but it
 met with no success

 f9 This passage really follows on the invocation Oh
 Muse drive the War etc from which indeed it is only
 divided by the interpolated criticism aimed at Carcinus

 f10 The scholiast informs us that these verses are
 borrowed from a poet of the sixth century BC

 f11 Sons of Philocles of the family of Aeschylus tragic
 writers derided by Aristophanes as bad poets and notorious
 gluttons

 f12 The Gorgons were represented with great teeth and
 therefore the same name was given to gluttons The Harpies
 to whom the two voracious poets are also compared were
 monsters with the face of a woman the body of a vulture and
 hooked beak and claws

TRYGAEUS Ah tis a rough job getting to the gods my legs are as good
as broken through it How small you were to be sure when seen from
heaven you had all the appearance too of being great rascals but seen
close you look even worse

SERVANT Is that you master

TRYGAEUS So Ive been told

SERVANT What has happened to you

TRYGAEUS My legs pain me it is such a plaguey long journey

SERVANT Oh tell me

TRYGAEUS What

SERVANT Did you see any other man besides yourself strolling about in
heaven

TRYGAEUS No only the souls of two or three dithyrambic poets

SERVANT What were they doing up there

TRYGAEUS They were seeking to catch some lyric exordia as they flew by
immersed in the billows of the air

SERVANT Is it true what they tell us that men are turned into stars
after death

TRYGAEUS Quite true

SERVANT Then who is that star I see over yonder

TRYGAEUS That is Ion of Chios1 the author of an ode beginning
Morning as soon as ever he got to heaven they called him the
Morning Star

 f1 A tragic and dithyrambic poet who had written many
 pieces which had met with great success at Athens

SERVANT And those stars like sparks that plough up the air as they dart
across the sky1

 f1 The shooting stars

TRYGAEUS They are the rich leaving the feast with a lantern and a light
inside itBut hurry up show this young girl into my house clean out
the bath heat some water and prepare the nuptial couch for herself and
me When tis done come back here meanwhile I am off to present this
one to the Senate

SERVANT But where then did you get these pretty chattels

TRYGAEUS Where why in heaven

SERVANT I would not give more than an obolus for gods who have got to
keeping brothels like us mere mortals

TRYGAEUS They are not all so but there are some up there too who live
by this trade

SERVANT Come thats rich But I bethink me shall I give her something
to eat

TRYGAEUS No for she would neither touch bread nor cake she is used to
licking ambrosia at the table of the gods

SERVANT Well we can give her something to lick down here too

CHORUS Here is a truly happy old man as far as I can judge

TRYGAEUS Ah but what shall I be when you see me presently dressed for
the wedding

CHORUS Made young again by love and scented with perfumes your lot will
be one we all shall envy

TRYGAEUS And when I lie beside her and caress her bosoms

CHORUS Oh then you will be happier than those spinningtops who call
Carcinus their father1

 f1 It has already been mentioned that the sons of Carcinus
 were dancers

TRYGAEUS And I well deserve it have I not bestridden a beetle to save
the Greeks who now thanks to me can make love at their ease and sleep
peacefully on their farms

SERVANT The girl has quitted the bath she is charming from head to
foot both belly and buttocks the cake is baked and they are kneading
the sesamebiscuit1 nothing is lacking but the bridegrooms virility

 f1 It was customary at weddings says Menander to give
 the bride a sesamecaked as an emblem of fruitfulness
 because sesame is the most fruitful of all seeds

TRYGAEUS Let us first hasten to lodge Theoria in the hands of the
Senate

SERVANT But tell me who is this woman

TRYGAEUS Why tis Theoria with whom we used formerly to go to
Brauron1 to get tipsy and frolic I had the greatest trouble to get
hold of her

 f1 An Attic town on the east coast noted for a
 magnificent temple in which stood the statue of Artemis
 which Orestes and Iphigenia had brought from the Tauric
 Chersonese and also for the Brauronia festivals that were
 celebrated every four years in honour of the goddess This
 was one of the festivals which the Attic people kept with
 the greatest pomp and was an occasion for debauchery

SERVANT Ah you charmer what pleasure your pretty bottom will afford me
every four years

TRYGAEUS Let us see who of you is steady enough to be trusted by the
Senate with the care of this charming wench Hi you friend what are
you drawing there

SERVANT I am drawing the plan of the tent I wish to erect for myself on
the isthmus1

 f1 Competitors intending to take part in the great
 Olympic Isthmian and other games took with them a tent
 wherein to camp in the open Further there is an obscene
 allusion which the actor indicates by a gesture

TRYGAEUS Come who wishes to take the charge of her No one Come
Theoria I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and
confide you to their care

SERVANT Ah there is one who makes a sign to you

TRYGAEUS Who is it

SERVANT Tis Ariphrades He wishes to take her home at once

TRYGAEUS No Im sure he shant He would soon have her done for
absorbing all her lifeforce Come Theoria put down all this gear1

Senate Prytanes look upon Theoria and see what precious blessings
I place in your hands Hasten to raise its limbs and to immolate the
victim Admire the fine chimney2 it is quite black with smoke for
twas here that the Senate did their cooking before the war Now that
you have found Theoria again you can start the most charming games from
tomorrow wrestling with her on the ground either on your hands and
feet or you can lay her on her side or stand before her with bent
knees or well rubbed with oil you can boldly enter the lists as
in the Pancratium belabouring your foe with blows from your fist or
otherwise The next day you will celebrate equestrian games in which
the riders will ride side by side or else the chariot teams thrown one
on top of another panting and whinnying will roll and knock against
each other on the ground while other rivals thrown out of their
seats will fall before reaching the goal utterly exhausted by their
effortsCome Prytanes take Theoria Oh look how graciously yonder
fellow has received her you would not have been in such a hurry to
introduce her to the Senate if nothing were coming to you through
it3 you would not have failed to plead some holiday as an excuse

 f1 Doubtless the vessels and other sacrificial objects and
 implements with which Theoria was laden in her character of
 presiding deity at religious ceremonies

 f2 Where the meats were cooked after sacrifice this also
 marks the secondary obscene sense he means to convey

 f3 One of the offices of the Prytanes was to introduce
 those who asked admission to the Senate but it would seem
 that none could obtain this favour without payment Without
 this a thousand excuses would be made for instance it
 would be a public holiday and consequently the Senate could
 receive no one As there was some festival nearly every
 day he whose purse would not open might have to wait a very
 long while

CHORUS Such a man as you assures the happiness of all his
fellowcitizens

TRYGAEUS When you are gathering your vintages you will prize me even
better

CHORUS Een from today we hail you as the deliverer of mankind

TRYGAEUS Wait until you have drunk a beaker of new wine before you
appraise my true merits

CHORUS Excepting the gods there is none greater than yourself and that
will ever be our opinion

TRYGAEUS Yea Trygaeus of Athmonia has deserved well of you he has
freed both husbandman and craftsman from the most cruel ills he has
vanquished Hyberbolus

SERVANT Well then what must be done now

TRYGAEUS You must offer pots of greenstuff to the goddess to consecrate
her altars

SERVANT Pots of greenstuff1 as we do to poor Hermesand even he
thinks the fare but mean

 f1 This was only offered to lesser deities

TRYGAEUS What will you offer them A fatted bull

SERVANT Oh no I dont want to start bellowing the battlecry1

 f1 In the Greek we have a play upon the similarity of the
 words for a bull and to shout the battlecry

TRYGAEUS A great fat swine then

SERVANT No no

TRYGAEUS Why not

SERVANT We dont want any of the swinishness of Theagenes1

 f1 Theagenes of the Piraeus a hideous coarse debauched
 and evilliving character of the day

TRYGAEUS What other victim do you prefer then

SERVANT A sheep

TRYGAEUS A sheep

SERVANT Yes

TRYGAEUS But you must give the word the Ionic form

SERVANT Purposely So that if anyone in the assembly says We must go
to war all may start bleating in alarm Oi oi1

 f1 That is the vocative of the Ionic form of the word in
 Attic Greek it is contracted throughout

TRYGAEUS A brilliant idea

SERVANT And we shall all be lambs one toward the other yea and milder
still toward the allies

TRYGAEUS Then go for the sheep and haste to bring it back with you I
will prepare the altar for the sacrifice

CHORUS How everything succeeds to our wish when the gods are willing
and Fortune favours us how opportunely everything falls out

TRYGAEUS Nothing could be truer for look here stands the altar all
ready at my door

CHORUS Hurry hurry for the winds are fickle make haste while the
divine will is set on stopping this cruel war and is showering on us the
most striking benefits

TRYGAEUS Here is the basket of barleyseed mingled with salt the
chaplet and the sacred knife and there is the fire so we are only
waiting for the sheep

CHORUS Hasten hasten for if Chaeris sees you he will come without
bidding he and his flute and when you see him puffing and panting and
out of breath you will have to give him something

TRYGAEUS Come seize the basket and take the lustral water and hurry to
circle round the altar to the right

SERVANT There tis done What is your next bidding

TRYGAEUS Hold I take this firebrand first and plunge it into the
water

SERVANT Be quick be quick Sprinkle the altar

TRYGAEUS Give me some barleyseed purify yourself and hand me the
basin then scatter the rest of the barley among the audience

SERVANT Tis done

TRYGAEUS You have thrown it

SERVANT Yes by Hermes and all the spectators have had their share

TRYGAEUS But not the women

SERVANT Oh their husbands will give it them this evening1

 f1 An obscene jest

TRYGAEUS Let us pray Who is here Are there any good men1

 f1 Before sacrificing the officiating person asked Who
 is here and those present answered Many good men

SERVANT Come give so that I may sprinkle these Faith they are indeed
good brave men

TRYGAEUS You believe so

SERVANT I am sure and the proof of it is that we have flooded them with
lustral water and they have not budged an inch1

 f1 The actors forming the chorus are meant here

TRYGAEUS Come then to prayers to prayers quickOh Peace mighty
queen venerated goddess thou who presidest over choruses and at
nuptials deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee

SERVANT Receive it greatly honoured mistress and behave not like the
coquettes who half open the door to entice the gallants draw back when
they are stared at to return once more if a man passes on But do not
act like this to us

TRYGAEUS No but like an honest woman show thyself to thy worshippers
who are worn with regretting thee all these thirteen years Hush the
noise of battle be a true Lysimacha to us1 Put an end to this
tittletattle to this idle babble that set us defying one another
Cause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship
and temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness Make
excellent commodities flow to our markets fine heads of garlic early
cucumbers apples pomegranates and nice little cloaks for the slaves
make them bring geese ducks pigeons and larks from Boeotia and baskets
of eels from Lake Copais we shall all rush to buy them disputing their
possession with Morychus Teleas Glaucetes and every other glutton
Melanthius2 will arrive on the market last of all twill be no more
eels all sold and then hell start agroaning and exclaiming as in
his monologue of Medea3 I am dying I am dying Alas I have let
those hidden in the beet escape me4 And wont we laugh These are
the wishes mighty goddess which we pray thee to grant

 f1 Lysimacha is derived from the Greek for put an end
 to and the Greek for fight

 f2 A tragic poet reputed a great gourmand

 f3 A tragedy by Melanthius

 f4 Eels were cooked with beetA parody on some verses in
 the Medea of Melanthius

SERVANT Take the knife and slaughter the sheep like a finished cook

TRYGAEUS No the goddess does not wish it1

 f1 As a matter of fact the Sicyonians who celebrated the
 festival of Peace on the sixteenth day of the month of
 Hecatombeon July spilled no blood upon her altar

SERVANT And why not

TRYGAEUS Blood cannot please Peace so let us spill none upon her altar
Therefore go and sacrifice the sheep in the house cut off the legs and
bring them here thus the carcase will be saved for the choregus

CHORUS You who remain here get chopped wood and everything needed for
the sacrifice ready

TRYGAEUS Dont I look like a diviner preparing his mystic fire

CHORUS Undoubtedly Will anything that it behooves a wise man to
know escape you Dont you know all that a man should know who is
distinguished for his wisdom and inventive daring

TRYGAEUS There the wood catches Its smoke blinds poor Stilbides1 I
am now going to bring the table and thus be my own slave

 f1 A celebrated diviner who had accompanied the Athenians
 on their expedition to Sicily Thus the War was necessary
 to make his calling pay and the smoke of the sacrifice
 offered to Peace must therefore be unpleasant to him

CHORUS You have braved a thousand dangers to save your sacred town All
honour to you your glory will be ever envied

SERVANT Hold Here are the legs place them upon the altar For myself
I mean to go back to the entrails and the cakes

TRYGAEUS Ill see to those I want you here

SERVANT Well then here I am Do you think I have been long

TRYGAEUS Just get this roasted Ah who is this man crowned with
laurel who is coming to me

SERVANT He has a selfimportant look is he some diviner

TRYGAEUS No I faith tis Hierocles

SERVANT Ah that oraclemonger from Oreus1 What is he going to tell
us

 f1 A town in Euboea on the channel which separated that
 island from Thessaly

TRYGAEUS Evidently he is coming to oppose the peace

SERVANT No tis the odour of the fat that attracts him

TRYGAEUS Let us appear not to see him

SERVANT Very well

HIEROCLES What sacrifice is this to what god are you offering it

TRYGAEUS TO THE SERVANT SilenceALOUD Look after the roasting and
keep your hands off the meat

HIEROCLES To whom are you sacrificing Answer me Ah the tail1 is
showing favourable omens

 f1 When sacrificing the tail was cut off the victim and
 thrown into the fire From the way in which it burnt the
 inference was drawn as to whether or not the sacrifice was
 agreeable to the deity

SERVANT Aye very favourable oh loved and mighty Peace

HIEROCLES Come cut off the first offering1 and make the oblation

 f1 This was the part that belonged to the priests and
 diviners As one of the latter class Hierocles is in haste
 to see this piece cut off

TRYGAEUS Tis not roasted enough

HIEROCLES Yea truly tis done to a turn

TRYGAEUS Mind your own business friend TO THE SERVANT Cut away
Where is the table Bring the libations

HIEROCLES The tongue is cut separately

TRYGAEUS We know all that But just listen to one piece of advice

HIEROCLES And that is

TRYGAEUS Dont talk for tis divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing

HIEROCLES Oh wretched mortals oh you idiots

TRYGAEUS Keep such ugly terms for yourself

HIEROCLES What you are so ignorant you dont understand the will of the
gods and you make a treaty you who are men with apes who are full of
malice1

 f1 The Spartans

TRYGAEUS Ha ha ha

HIEROCLES What are you laughing at

TRYGAEUS Ha ha your apes amuse me

HIEROCLES You simple pigeons you trust yourselves to foxes who are all
craft both in mind and heart

TRYGAEUS Oh you troublemaker may your lungs get as hot as this meat

HIEROCLES Nay nay if only the Nymphs had not fooled Bacis and Bacis
mortal men and if the Nymphs had not tricked Bacis a second time1

 f1 Emphatic pathos incomprehensible even to the diviner
 himself this is a satire on the obscure style of the
 oracles Bacis was a famous Boeotian diviner

TRYGAEUS May the plague seize you if you dont stop wearying us with
your Bacis

HIEROCLES it would not have been written in the book of Fate that the
bends of Peace must be broken but first

TRYGAEUS The meat must be dusted with salt

HIEROCLES it does not please the blessed gods that we should stop the
War until the wolf uniteth with the sheep

TRYGAEUS How you cursed animal could the wolf ever unite with the
sheep

HIEROCLES As long as the woodbug gives off a fetid odour when it
flies as long as the noisy bitch is forced by nature to litter blind
pups so long shall peace be forbidden

TRYGAEUS Then what should be done Not to stop War would be to leave
it to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the
most whereas by uniting under a treaty we share the empire of Greece

HIEROCLES You will never make the crab walk straight

TRYGAEUS You shall no longer be fed at the Prytaneum the war done
oracles are not wanted

HIEROCLES You will never smooth the rough spikes of the hedgehog

TRYGAEUS Will you never stop fooling the Athenians

HIEROCLES What oracle ordered you to burn these joints of mutton in
honour of the gods

TRYGAEUS This grand oracle of Homers Thus vanished the dark
warclouds and we offered a sacrifice to newborn Peace When the flame
had consumed the thighs of the victim and its inwards had appeased our
hunger we poured out the libations of wine Twas I who arranged the
sacred rites but none offered the shining cup to the diviner1

 f1 Of course this is not a bona fide quotation but a
 whimsical adaptation of various Homeric verses the last is
 a coinage of his own and means that he is to have no part
 either in the flesh of the victim or in the wine of the
 libations

HIEROCLES I care little for that Tis not the Sibyl who spoke it1

 f1 Probably the Sibyl of Delphi is meant

TRYGAEUS Wise Homer has also said He who delights in the horrors of
civil war has neither country nor laws nor home What noble words

HIEROCLES Beware lest the kite turn your brain and rob

TRYGAEUS Look out slave This oracle threatens our meat Quick pour
the libation and give me some of the inwards

HIEROCLES I too will help myself to a bit if you like

TRYGAEUS The libation the libation

HIEROCLES Pour out also for me and give me some of this meat

TRYGAEUS No the blessed gods wont allow it yet let us drink and as
for you get you gone for tis their will Mighty Peace stay ever in
our midst

HIEROCLES Bring the tongue hither

TRYGAEUS Relieve us of your own

HIEROCLES The libation

TRYGAEUS Here and this into the bargain STRIKES HIM

HIEROCLES You will not give me any meat

TRYGAEUS We cannot give you any until the wolf unites with the sheep

HIEROCLES I will embrace your knees

TRYGAEUS Tis lost labour good fellow you will never smooth the rough
spikes of the hedgehog Come spectators join us in our feast

HIEROCLES And what am I to do

TRYGAEUS You go and eat the Sibyl

HIEROCLES No by the Earth no you shall not eat without me if you do
not give I take tis common property

TRYGAEUS TO THE SERVANT Strike strike this Bacis this humbugging
soothsayer

HIEROCLES I take to witness

TRYGAEUS And I also that you are a glutton and an impostor Hold him
tight and beat the impostor with a stick

SERVANT You look to that I will snatch the skin from him which he has
stolen from us1 Are you going to let go that skin you priest from
hell do you hear Oh what a fine crow has come from Oreus Stretch
your wings quickly for Elymnium2

 f1 The skin of the victim that is to say

 f2 A temple in Euboea close to Oreus The servant means
 Return where you came from

CHORUS Oh joy joy no more helmet no more cheese nor onions1 No I
have no passion for battles what I love is to drink with good comrades
in the corner by the fire when good dry wood cut in the height of the
summer is crackling it is to cook pease on the coals and beechnuts
among the embers tis to kiss our pretty Thracian2 while my wife is
at the bath Nothing is more pleasing when the rain is sprouting our
sowings than to chat with some friend saying Tell me Comarchides
what shall we do I would willingly drink myself while the heavens are
watering our fields Come wife cook three measures of beans adding
to them a little wheat and give us some figs Syra call Manes off the
fields tis impossible to prune the vine or to align the ridges for
the ground is too wet today Let someone bring me the thrush and those
two chaffinches there were also some curds and four pieces of hare
unless the cat stole them last evening for I know not what the infernal
noise was that I heard in the house Serve up three of the pieces for
me slave and give the fourth to my father Go and ask Aeschinades for
some myrtle branches with berries on them and then for tis the same
road you will invite Charinades to come and drink with me to the honour
of the gods who watch over our crops When the grasshopper sings his
dulcet tune I love to see the Lemnian vines beginning to ripen for
tis the earliest plant of all I love likewise to watch the fig filling
out and when it has reached maturity I eat with appreciation and
exclaim Oh delightful season Then too I bruise some thyme and
infuse it in water Indeed I grow a great deal fatter passing the summer
in this way than in watching a cursed captain with his three plumes
and his military cloak of a startling crimson he calls it true Sardian
purple which he takes care to dye himself with Cyzicus saffron in
a battle then he is the first to run away shaking his plumes like a
great yellow prancing cock3 while I am left to watch the nets4
Once back again in Athens these brave fellows behave abominably they
write down these they scratch through others and this backwards
and forwards two or three times at random The departure is set for
tomorrow and some citizen has brought no provisions because he didnt
know he had to go he stops in front of the statue of Pandion5 reads
his name is dumbfounded and starts away at a run weeping bitter tears
The townsfolk are less illused but that is how the husbandmen are
treated by these men of war the hated of the gods and of men who
know nothing but how to throw away their shield For this reason if it
please heaven I propose to call these rascals to account for they are
lions in times of peace but sneaking foxes when it comes to fighting

 f1 This was the soldiers usual ration on duty

 f2 Slaves often bore the name of the country of their
 birth

 f3 Because of the new colour which fear had lent his
 chlamys

 f4 Meaning that he deserts his men in midcampaign
 leaving them to look after the enemy

 f5 Ancient King of Athens This was one of the twelve
 statues on the pedestals of which the names of the soldiers
 chose for departure on service were written The decrees
 were also placarded on them

TRYGAEUS Oh oh what a crowd for the nuptial feast Here dust the
tables with this crest which is good for nothing else now Halloa
produce the cakes the thrushes plenty of good jugged hare and the
little loaves

A SICKLEMAKER Trygaeus where is Trygaeus

TRYGAEUS I am cooking the thrushes

SICKLEMAKER Trygaeus my best of friends what a fine stroke of
business you have done for me by bringing back Peace Formerly my
sickles would not have sold at an obolus apiece today I am being paid
fifty drachmae for every one And here is a neighbour who is selling his
casks for the country at three drachmae each So come Trygaeus take as
many sickles and casks as you will for nothing Accept them for nothing
tis because of our handsome profits on our sales that we offer you
these wedding presents

TRYGAEUS Thanks Put them all down inside there and come along quick to
the banquet Ah do you see that armourer yonder coming with a wry face

A CRESTMAKER Alas alas Trygaeus you have ruined me utterly

TRYGAEUS What wont the crests go any more friend

CRESTMAKER You have killed my business my livelihood and that of this
poor lancemaker too

TRYGAEUS Come come what are you asking for these two crests

CRESTMAKER What do you bid for them

TRYGAEUS What do I bid Oh I am ashamed to say Still as the clasp
is of good workmanship I would give two even three measures of dried
figs I could use em for dusting the table

CRESTMAKER All right tell them to bring me the dried figs tis always
better than nothing

TRYGAEUS Take them away be off with your crests and get you gone they
are moulting they are losing all their hair I would not give a single
fig for them

A BREASTPLATEMAKER Good gods what am I going to do with this fine
tenminae breastplate which is so splendidly made

TRYGAEUS Oh you will lose nothing over it

BREASTPLATEMAKER I will sell it to you at cost price

TRYGAEUS Twould be very useful as a nightstool

BREASTPLATEMAKER Cease your insults both to me and my wares

TRYGAEUS if propped on three stones Look tis admirable

BREASTPLATEMAKER But how can you wipe idiot

TRYGAEUS I can pass one hand through here and the other there and
so

BREASTPLATEMAKER What do you wipe with both hands

TRYGAEUS Aye so that I may not be accused of robbing the State by
blocking up an oarhole in the galley1

 f1 The trierarchs stopped up some of the holes made for
 the oars in order to reduce the number of rowers they had
 to supply for the galleys they thus saved the wages of the
 rowers they dispensed with

BREASTPLATEMAKER So you would pay ten minae1 for a nightstool

 f1 The mina was equivalent to about three pounds ten
 shillings

TRYGAEUS Undoubtedly you rascal Do you think I would sell my rump for
a thousand drachmae1

 f1 Which is the same thing since a mina was worth a
 hundred drachmae

BREASTPLATEMAKER Come have the money paid over to me

TRYGAEUS No friend I find it hurts me to sit on Take it away I wont
buy it

A TRUMPETMAKER What is to be done with this trumpet for which I gave
sixty drachmae the other day

TRYGAEUS Pour lead into the hollow and fit a good long stick to the
top and you will have a balanced cottabos1

 f1 For cottabos see note above

TRUMPETMAKER Ha would you mock me

TRYGAEUS Well heres another notion Pour in lead as I said add here a
dish hung on strings and you will have a balance for weighing the figs
which you give your slaves in the fields

A HELMETMAKER Cursed fate I am ruined Here are helmets for which I
gave a mina each What I to do with them who will buy them

TRYGAEUS Go and sell them to the Egyptians they will do for measuring
loosening medicines1

 f1 Syrmoea a kind of purgative syrup much used by the
 Egyptians made of antiscorbutic herbs such as mustard
 horseradish etc

A SPEARMAKER Ah poor helmetmaker things are indeed in a bad way

TRYGAEUS That man has no cause for complaint

SPEARMAKER But helmets will be no more used

TRYGAEUS Let him learn to fit a handle to them and he can sell them for
more money1

 f1 As winepots or similar vessels

SPEARMAKER Let us be off comrade

TRYGAEUS No I want to buy these spears

SPEARMAKER What will you give

TRYGAEUS If they could be split in two I would take them at a drachma
per hundred to use as vineprops

SPEARMAKER The insolent dog Let us go friend

TRYGAEUS Ah here come the guests children from the table to relieve
themselves I fancy they also want to hum over what they will be singing
presently Hi child what do you reckon to sing Stand there and give
me the opening line

THE SON OF LAMACHUS Glory to the young warriors

TRYGAEUS Oh leave off about your young warriors you little wretch we
are at peace and you are an idiot and a rascal

SON OF LAMACHUS The skirmish begins the hollow bucklers clash against
each other1

 f1 These verses and those which both Trygaeus and the son
 of Lamachus quote afterwards are borrowed from the Iliad

TRYGAEUS Bucklers Leave me in peace with your bucklers

SON OF LAMACHUS And then there came groanings and shouts of victory

TRYGAEUS Groanings ah by Bacchus look out for yourself you cursed
squaller if you start wearying us again with your groanings and hollow
bucklers

SON OF LAMACHUS Then what should I sing Tell me what pleases you

TRYGAEUS Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen or something
similar as for instance Everything that could tickle the palate was
placed on the table

SON OF LAMACHUS Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen and tired
of warfare unharnessed their foaming steeds

TRYGAEUS Thats splendid tired of warfare they seat themselves at
table sing sing to us how they still go on eating after they are
satiated

SON OF LAMACHUS The meal over they girded themselves

TRYGAEUS With good wine no doubt

SON OF LAMACHUS with armour and rushed forth from the towers and a
terrible shout arose

TRYGAEUS Get you gone you little scapegrace you and your battles You
sing of nothing but warfare Who is your father then

SON OF LAMACHUS My father

TRYGAEUS Why yes your father

SON OF LAMACHUS I am Lamachus son

TRYGAEUS Oh oh I could indeed have sworn when I was listening to you
that you were the son of some warrior who dreams of nothing but wounds
and bruises of some Boulomachus or Clausimachus1 go and sing your
plaguey songs to the spearmen Where is the son of Cleonymus Sing me
something before going back to the feast I am at least certain he will
not sing of battles for his father is far too careful a man

 f1 Boulomachus is derived from two Greek words meaning
 to wish for battle Clausimachus from two others the
 tears that battles cost The same root for battle is
 also contained in the name Lamachus

SON OF CLEONYMUS An inhabitant of Sais is parading with the spotless
shield which I regret to say I have thrown into a thicket1

 f1 A distich borrowed from Archilochus a celebrated poet
 of the seventh century BC born at Paros and the author
 of odes satires epigrams and elegies He sang his own
 shame Twas in an expedition against Sais not the town in
 Egypt as the similarity in name might lead one to believe
 but in Thrace that he had cast away his buckler A might
 calamity truly he says without shame I shall buy
 another

TRYGAEUS Tell me you little goodfornothing are you singing that for
your father

SON OF CLEONYMUS But I saved my life

TRYGAEUS And dishonoured your family But let us go in I am very
certain that being the son of such a father you will never forget this
song of the buckler You who remain to the feast tis your duty to
devour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws Come put heart into
the work and eat with your mouths full For believe me poor friends
white teeth are useless furniture if they chew nothing

CHORUS Never fear thanks all the same for your good advice

TRYGAEUS You who yesterday were dying of hunger come stuff yourselves
with this fine harestew tis not every day that we find cakes lying
neglected Eat eat or I predict you will soon regret it

CHORUS Silence Keep silence Here is the bride about to appear Take
nuptial torches and let all rejoice and join in our songs Then when we
have danced clinked our cups and thrown Hyperbolus through the doorway
we will carry back all our farming tools to the fields and shall pray
the gods to give wealth to the Greeks and to cause us all to gather in
an abundant barley harvest enjoy a noble vintage to grant that we may
choke with good figs that our wives may prove fruitful that in fact we
may recover all our lost blessings and that the sparkling fire may be
restored to the hearth

TRYGAEUS Come wife to the fields and seek my beauty to brighten and
enliven my nights Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

CHORUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus oh thrice happy man who so well
deserve your good fortune

TRYGAEUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

CHORUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

FIRST SEMICHORUS What shall we do to her

SECOND SEMICHORUS What shall we do to her

FIRST SEMICHORUS We will gather her kisses

SECOND SEMICHORUS We will gather her kisses

CHORUS Come comrades we who are in the first row let us pick up
the bridegroom and carry him in triumph Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus Oh
Hymen oh Hymenaeus

TRYGAEUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

CHORUS You shall have a fine house no cares and the finest of figs Oh
Hymen oh Hymenaeus

TRYGAEUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

CHORUS The bridegrooms fig is great and thick the brides very soft
and tender

TRYGAEUS While eating and drinking deep draughts of wine continue to
repeat Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

CHORUS Oh Hymen oh Hymenaeus

TRYGAEUS Farewell farewell my friends All who come with me shall have
cakes galore

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
