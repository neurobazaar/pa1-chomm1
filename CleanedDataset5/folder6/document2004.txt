PIGS IS PIGS

By Ellis Parker Butler




Mike Flannery the Westcote agent of the Interurban Express Company
leaned over the counter of the express office and shook his fist
Mr Morehouse angry and red stood on the other side of the counter
trembling with rage The argument had been long and heated and at last
Mr Morehouse had talked himself speechless The cause of the trouble
stood on the counter between the two men It was a soap box across
the top of which were nailed a number of strips forming a rough but
serviceable cage In it two spotted guineapigs were greedily eating
lettuce leaves

Do as you loike then shouted Flannery pay for thim an take
thim or dont pay for thim and leave thim be Rules is rules Misther
Morehouse an Mike Flannerys not goin to be called down fer breakin
of thim

But you everlastingly stupid idiot shouted Mr Morehouse madly
shaking a flimsy printed book beneath the agents nose cant you read
it herein your own plain printed rates Pets domestic Franklin to
Westcote if properly boxed twentyfive cents each He threw the book
on the counter in disgust What more do you want Arent they pets
Arent they domestic Arent they properly boxed What

He turned and walked back and forth rapidly frowning ferociously

Suddenly he turned to Flannery and forcing his voice to an artificial
calmness spoke slowly but with intense sarcasm

Pets he said Pets Twentyfive cents each There are two of them
One Two Two times twentyfive are fifty Can you understand that I
offer you fifty cents

Flannery reached for the book He ran his hand through the pages and
stopped at page sixty four

An I dont take fifty cints he whispered in mockery Heres the
rule for ut Whin the agint be in anny doubt regardin which of two
rates applies to a shipment he shall charge the larger The consigney
may file a claim for the overcharge In this case Misther Morehouse
I be in doubt Pets thim animals may be an domestic they be but pigs
Im blame sure they do be an me rules says plain as the nose on
yer face Pigs Franklin to Westcote thirty cints each An Mister
Morehouse by me arithmetical knowledge two times thurty comes to sixty
cints

Mr Morehouse shook his head savagely Nonsense he shouted
confounded nonsense I tell you Why you poor ignorant foreigner that
rule means common pigs domestic pigs not guinea pigs

Flannery was stubborn

Pigs is pigs he declared firmly Guineapigs or dago pigs or Irish
pigs is all the same to the Interurban Express Company an to Mike
Flannery Th nationality of the pig creates no differentiality in the
rate Misther Morehouse Twould be the same was they Dutch pigs or
Rooshun pigs Mike Flannery he added is here to tind to the expriss
business and not to hould conversation wid dago pigs in sivinteen
languages fer to discover be they Chinese or Tipperary by birth an
nativity

Mr Morehouse hesitated He bit his lip and then flung out his arms
wildly

Very well he shouted you shall hear of this Your president shall
hear of this It is an outrage I have offered you fifty cents You
refuse it Keep the pigs until you are ready to take the fifty cents
but by George sir if one hair of those pigs heads is harmed I will
have the law on you

He turned and stalked out slamming the door Flannery carefully lifted
the soap box from the counter and placed it in a corner He was not
worried He felt the peace that comes to a faithful servant who has done
his duty and done it well

Mr Morehouse went home raging His boy who had been awaiting the
guineapigs knew better than to ask him for them He was a normal boy
and therefore always had a guilty conscience when his father was
angry So the boy slipped quietly around the house There is nothing so
soothing to a guilty conscience as to be out of the path of the avenger
Mr Morehouse stormed into the house Wheres the ink he shouted at
his wife as soon as his foot was across the doorsill

Mrs Morehouse jumped guiltily She never used ink She had not seen
the ink nor moved the ink nor thought of the ink but her husbands
tone convicted her of the guilt of having borne and reared a boy and
she knew that whenever her husband wanted anything in a loud voice the
boy had been at it

Ill find Sammy she said meekly

When the ink was found Mr Morehouse wrote rapidly and he read the
completed letter and smiled a triumphant smile

That will settle that crazy Irishman he exclaimed When they get
that letter he will hunt another job all right

A week later Mr Morehouse received a long official envelope with the
card of the Interurban Express Company in the upper left corner He tore
it open eagerly and drew out a sheet of paper At the top it bore the
number A6754 The letter was short SubjectRate on guineapigs
it said Dr SirWe are in receipt of your letter regarding rate on
guineapigs between Franklin and Westcote addressed to the president
of this company All claims for overcharge should be addressed to the
Claims Department

Mr Morehouse wrote to the Claims Department He wrote six pages of
choice sarcasm vituperation and argument and sent them to the Claims
Department

A few weeks later he received a reply from the Claims Department
Attached to it was his last letter

Dr Sir said the reply Your letter of the 16th inst addressed to
this Department subject rate on guineapigs from Franklin to Westcote
reed We have taken up the matter with our agent at Westcote and his
reply is attached herewith He informs us that you refused to receive
the consignment or to pay the charges You have therefore no claim
against this company and your letter regarding the proper rate on the
consignment should be addressed to our Tariff Department

Mr Morehouse wrote to the Tariff Department He stated his case
clearly and gave his arguments in full quoting a page or two from the
encyclopedia to prove that guineapigs were not common pigs

With the care that characterizes corporations when they are
systematically conducted Mr Morehouses letter was numbered OKd
and started through the regular channels Duplicate copies of the bill
of lading manifest Flannerys receipt for the package and several
other pertinent papers were pinned to the letter and they were passed
to the head of the Tariff Department

The head of the Tariff Department put his feet on his desk and yawned
He looked through the papers carelessly

Miss Kane he said to his stenographer take this letter Agent
Westcote N J Please advise why consignment referred to in attached
papers was refused domestic pet rates

Miss Kane made a series of curves and angles on her note book and waited
with pencil poised The head of the department looked at the papers
again

Huh guineapigs he said Probably starved to death by this time
Add this to that letter Give condition of consignment at present

He tossed the papers on to the stenographers desk took his feet from
his own desk and went out to lunch

When Mike Flannery received the letter he scratched his head

Give prisint condition he repeated thoughtfully Now what do thim
clerks be wantin to know I wonder Prisint condition is ut Thim
pigs praise St Patrick do be in good health so far as I know but I
niver was no veternairy surgeon to dago pigs Mebby thim clerks wants
me to call in the pig docther an have their pulses took Wan thing I
do know howiver which is theyve glorious appytites for pigs of their
soize Ate Theyd ate the brass padlocks off of a barn door I If the
paddy pig by the same token ate as hearty as these dago pigs do
thered be a famine in Ireland

To assure himself that his report would be up to date Flannery went
to the rear of the office and looked into the cage The pigs had been
transferred to a larger boxa dry goods box

Wan  two  tree  four  five  six  sivin  eight
he counted Sivin spotted an wan all black All well an hearty an
all eatin loike ragin hippypottymusses He went back to his desk and
wrote

Mr Morgan Head of Tariff Department he wrote Why do I say dago
pigs is pigs because they is pigs and will be til you say they aint
which is what the rule book says stop your jollying me you know it as
well as I do As to health they are all well and hoping you are the
same P S There are eight now the family increased all good eaters P
S I paid out so far two dollars for cabbage which they like shall I put
in bill for same what

Morgan head of the Tariff Department when he received this letter
laughed He read it again and became serious

By George he said Flannery is right pigs is pigs Ill have to
get authority on this thing Meanwhile Miss Kane take this letter
Agent Westcote N J Regarding shipment guineapigs File No A6754
Rule 83 General Instruction to Agents clearly states that agents
shall collect from consignee all costs of provender etc etc
required for live stock while in transit or storage You will proceed to
collect same from consignee

Flannery received this letter next morning and when he read it he
grinned

Proceed to collect he said softly How thim clerks do loike to be
talkin Me proceed to collect two dollars and twintyfoive cints off
Misther Morehouse I wonder do thim clerks know Misther Morehouse
Ill git it Oh yes Misther Morehouse two an a quarter plaze
Certnly me dear frind Flannery Delighted Not

Flannery drove the express wagon to Mr Morehouses door Mr Morehouse
answered the bell

Ah ha he cried as soon as he saw it was Flannery So youve come to
your senses at last have you I thought you would Bring the box in

I hev no box said Flannery coldly I hev a bill agin Misther John
C Morehouse for two dollars and twintyfoive cints for kebbages aten by
his dago pigs Wud you wish to pay ut

PayCabbages gasped Mr Morehouse Do you mean to say that two
little guineapigs

Eight said Flannery Papa an mamma an the six childer Eight

For answer Mr Morehouse slammed the door in Flannerys face Flannery
looked at the door reproachfully

I take ut the consigny dont want to pay for thim kebbages he said
If I know signs of refusal the consigny refuses to pay for wan dang
kebbage leaf an be hanged to me

Mr Morgan the head of the Tariff Department consulted the president
of the Interurban Express Company regarding guineapigs as to whether
they were pigs or not pigs The president was inclined to treat the
matter lightly

What is the rate on pigs and on pets he asked

Pigs thirty cents pets twentyfive said Morgan

Then of course guineapigs are pigs said the president

Yes agreed Morgan I look at it that way too A thing that can come
under two rates is naturally due to be classed as the higher But are
guineapigs pigs Arent they rabbits

Come to think of it said the president I believe they are more like
rabbits Sort of halfway station between pig and rabbit I think the
question is thisare guineapigs of the domestic pig family Ill ask
professor Gordon He is authority on such things Leave the papers with
me

The president put the papers on his desk and wrote a letter to Professor
Gordon Unfortunately the Professor was in South America collecting
zoological specimens and the letter was forwarded to him by his wife
As the Professor was in the highest Andes where no white man had ever
penetrated the letter was many months in reaching him The president
forgot the guineapigs Morgan forgot them Mr Morehouse forgot them
but Flannery did not Onehalf of his time he gave to the duties of
his agency the other half was devoted to the guineapigs Long before
Professor Gordon received the presidents letter Morgan received one
from Flannery

About them dago pigs it said what shall I do they are great in
family life no race suicide for them there are thirtytwo now shall
I sell them do you take this express office for a menagerie answer
quick

Morgan reached for a telegraph blank and wrote

Agent Westcote Dont sell pigs

He then wrote Flannery a letter calling his attention to the fact that
the pigs were not the property of the company but were merely being held
during a settlement of a dispute regarding rates He advised Flannery to
take the best possible care of them

Flannery letter in hand looked at the pigs and sighed The drygoods
box cage had become too small He boarded up twenty feet of the rear
of the express office to make a large and airy home for them and went
about his business He worked with feverish intensity when out on his
rounds for the pigs required attention and took most of his time Some
months later in desperation he seized a sheet of paper and wrote
160 across it and mailed it to Morgan Morgan returned it asking for
explanation Flannery replied

There be now one hundred sixty of them dago pigs for heavens sake let
me sell off some do you want me to go crazy what

Sell no pigs Morgan wired

Not long after this the president of the express company received a
letter from Professor Gordon It was a long and scholarly letter but
the point was that the guineapig was the Cava aparoea while the common
pig was the genius Sus of the family Suidae He remarked that they were
prolific and multiplied rapidly

They are not pigs said the president decidedly to Morgan The
twentyfive cent rate applies

Morgan made the proper notation on the papers that had accumulated in
File A6754 and turned them over to the Audit Department The Audit
Department took some time to look the matter up and after the usual
delay wrote Flannery that as he had on hand one hundred and sixty
guineapigs the property of consignee he should deliver them and
collect charges at the rate of twentyfive cents each

Flannery spent a day herding his charges through a narrow opening in
their cage so that he might count them

Audit Dept he wrote when he had finished the count you are way off
there may be was one hundred and sixty dago pigs once but wake up dont
be a back number Ive got even eight hundred now shall I collect
for eight hundred or what how about sixtyfour dollars I paid out for
cabbages

It required a great many letters back and forth before the Audit
Department was able to understand why the error had been made of billing
one hundred and sixty instead of eight hundred and still more time for
it to get the meaning of the cabbages

Flannery was crowded into a few feet at the extreme front of the
office The pigs had all the rest of the room and two boys were employed
constantly attending to them The day after Flannery had counted the
guineapigs there were eight more added to his drove and by the time
the Audit Department gave him authority to collect for eight hundred
Flannery had given up all attempts to attend to the receipt or the
delivery of goods He was hastily building galleries around the express
office tier above tier He had four thousand and sixtyfour guineapigs
to care for More were arriving daily

Immediately following its authorization the Audit Department sent
another letter but Flannery was too busy to open it They wrote another
and then they telegraphed

Error in guineapig bill Collect for two guineapigs fifty cents
Deliver all to consignee

Flannery read the telegram and cheered up He wrote out a bill as
rapidly as his pencil could travel over paper and ran all the way to the
Morehouse home At the gate he stopped suddenly The house stared at
him with vacant eyes The windows were bare of curtains and he could see
into the empty rooms A sign on the porch said To Let Mr Morehouse
had moved Flannery ran all the way back to the express office
Sixtynine guineapigs had been born during his absence He ran out
again and made feverish inquiries in the village Mr Morehouse had not
only moved but he had left Westcote Flannery returned to the express
office and found that two hundred and six guineapigs had entered the
world since he left it He wrote a telegram to the Audit Department

Cant collect fifty cents for two dago pigs consignee has left town
address unknown what shall I do Flannery

The telegram was handed to one of the clerks in the Audit Department
and as he read it he laughed

Flannery must be crazy He ought to know that the thing to do is to
return the consignment here said the clerk He telegraphed Flannery to
send the pigs to the main office of the company at Franklin

When Flannery received the telegram he set to work The six boys he
had engaged to help him also set to work They worked with the haste of
desperate men making cages out of soap boxes cracker boxes and all
kinds of boxes and as fast as the cages were completed they filled them
with guineapigs and expressed them to Franklin Day after day the cages
of guineapigs flowed in a steady stream from Westcote to Franklin
and still Flannery and his six helpers ripped and nailed and
packedrelentlessly and feverishly At the end of the week they had
shipped two hundred and eighty cases of guineapigs and there were in
the express office seven hundred and four more pigs than when they began
packing them

Stop sending pigs Warehouse full came a telegram to Flannery He
stopped packing only long enough to wire back Cant stop and kept
on sending them On the next train up from Franklin came one of
the companys inspectors He had instructions to stop the stream of
guineapigs at all hazards As his train drew up at Westcote station
he saw a cattle car standing on the express companys siding When he
reached the express office he saw the express wagon backed up to the
door Six boys were carrying bushel baskets full of guineapigs from the
office and dumping them into the wagon Inside the room Flannery with
his coat and vest off was shoveling guineapigs into bushel baskets
with a coal scoop He was winding up the guineapig episode

He looked up at the inspector with a snort of anger

Wan wagonload more an Ill be quit of thim an niver will ye catch
Flannery wid no more foreign pigs on his hands No sur They near was
the death o me Nixt toime Ill know that pigs of whaiver nationality
is domistic petsan go at the lowest rate

He began shoveling again rapidly speaking quickly between breaths

Rules may be rules but you cant fool Mike Flannery twice wid the same
thrickwhin ut comes to live stock dang the rules So long as Flannery
runs this expriss officepigs is petsan cows is petsan horses
is petsan lions an tigers an Rocky Mountain goats is petsan the
rate on thim is twintyfoive cints

He paused long enough to let one of the boys put an empty basket in the
place of the one he had just filled There were only a few guineapigs
left As he noted their limited number his natural habit of looking on
the bright side returned

Well annyhow he said cheerfully tis not so bad as ut might be
What if thim dago pigs had been elephants

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
