OFLAHERTY VC A RECRUITING PAMPHLET


By George Bernard Shaw



It may surprise some people to learn that in 1915 this little play was
a recruiting poster in disguise The British officer seldom likes Irish
soldiers but he always tries to have a certain proportion of them in
his battalion because partly from a want of common sense which leads
them to value their lives less than Englishmen do lives are really
less worth living in a poor country and partly because even the most
cowardly Irishman feels obliged to outdo an Englishman in bravery if
possible and at least to set a perilous pace for him Irish soldiers
give impetus to those military operations which require for their
spirited execution more devilment than prudence

Unfortunately Irish recruiting was badly bungled in 1915 The Irish
were for the most part Roman Catholics and loyal Irishmen which means
that from the English point of view they were heretics and rebels But
they were willing enough to go soldiering on the side of France and
see the world outside Ireland which is a dull place to live in It was
quite easy to enlist them by approaching them from their own point of
view But the War Office insisted on approaching them from the point of
view of Dublin Castle They were discouraged and repulsed by refusals to
give commissions to Roman Catholic officers or to allow distinct
Irish units to be formed To attract them the walls were covered with
placards headed REMEMBER BELGIUM The folly of asking an Irishman to
remember anything when you want him to fight for England was apparent to
everyone outside the Castle FORGET AND FORGIVE would have been more
to the point Remembering Belgium and its broken treaty led Irishmen to
remember Limerick and its broken treaty and the recruiting ended in
a rebellion in suppressing which the British artillery quite
unnecessarily reduced the centre of Dublin to ruins and the British
commanders killed their leading prisoners of war in cold blood morning
after morning with an effect of longdrawnout ferocity Really it was
only the usual childish petulance in which John Bull does things in a
week that disgrace him for a century though he soon recovers his good
humor and cannot understand why the survivors of his wrath do not feel
as jolly with him as he does with them On the smouldering ruins of
Dublin the appeals to remember Louvain were presently supplemented by a
fresh appeal IRISHMEN DO YOU WISH TO HAVE THE HORRORS OF WAR BROUGHT
TO YOUR OWN HEARTHS AND HOMES Dublin laughed sourly

As for me I addressed myself quite simply to the business of obtaining
recruits I knew by personal experience and observation what anyone
might have inferred from the records of Irish emigration that all an
Irishmans hopes and ambitions turn on his opportunities of getting out
of Ireland Stimulate his loyalty and he will stay in Ireland and
die for her for incomprehensible as it seems to an Englishman Irish
patriotism does not take the form of devotion to England and Englands
king Appeal to his discontent his deadly boredom his thwarted
curiosity and desire for change and adventure and to escape from
Ireland he will go abroad to risk his life for France for the Papal
States for secession in America and even if no better may be for
England Knowing that the ignorance and insularity of the Irishman is a
danger to himself and to his neighbors I had no scruple in making that
appeal when there was something for him to fight which the whole world
had to fight unless it meant to come under the jack boot of the German
version of Dublin Castle

There was another consideration unmentionable by the recruiting
sergeants and war orators which must nevertheless have helped them
powerfully in procuring soldiers by voluntary enlistment The happy home
of the idealist may become common under millennial conditions It is not
common at present No one will ever know how many men joined the army
in 1914 and 1915 to escape from tyrants and taskmasters termagants
and shrews none of whom are any the less irksome when they happen
by illluck to be also our fathers our mothers our wives and our
children Even at their amiablest a holiday from them may be a tempting
change for all parties That is why I did not endow OFlaherty VC with
an ideal Irish colleen for his sweetheart and gave him for his mother a
Volumnia of the potato patch rather than a affectionate parent from whom
he could not so easily have torn himself away

I need hardly say that a play thus carefully adapted to its purpose was
voted utterly inadmissible and in due course the British Government
frightened out of its wits for the moment by the rout of the Fifth Army
ordained Irish Conscription and then did not dare to go through with
it I still think my own line was the more businesslike But during the
war everyone except the soldiers at the front imagined that nothing
but an extreme assertion of our most passionate prejudices without the
smallest regard to their effect on others could win the war Finally
the British blockade won the war but the wonder is that the British
blockhead did not lose it I suppose the enemy was no wiser War is not
a sharpener of wits and I am afraid I gave great offence by keeping my
head in this matter of Irish recruiting What can I do but apologize
and publish the play now that it can no longer do any good




OFLAHERTY VC

At the door of an Irish country house in a park Fine summer weather
the summer of 1916 The porch painted white projects into the drive
but the door is at the side and the front has a window The porch faces
east and the door is in the north side of it On the south side is a
tree in which a thrush is singing Under the window is a garden seat
with an iron chair at each end of it

The last four bars of God Save the King are heard in the distance
followed by three cheers Then the band strikes up Its a Long Way to
Tipperary and recedes until it is out of hearing

Private OFlaherty VC comes wearily southward along the drive and
falls exhausted into the garden seat The thrush utters a note of alarm
and flies away The tramp of a horse is heard

A GENTLEMANS VOICE Tim Hi Tim He is heard dismounting

A LABORERS VOICE Yes your honor

THE GENTLEMANS VOICE Take this horse to the stables will you

A LABORERS VOICE Right your honor Yup there Gwan now Gwan The
horse is led away

General Sir Pearce Madigan an elderly baronet in khaki beaming with
enthusiasm arrives OFlaherty rises and stands at attention

SIR PEARCE No no OFlaherty none of that now Youre off duty
Remember that though I am a general of forty years service that little
Cross of yours gives you a higher rank in the roll of glory than I can
pretend to

OFLAHERTY relaxing Im thankful to you Sir Pearce but I wouldnt
have anyone think that the baronet of my native place would let a common
soldier like me sit down in his presence without leave

SIR PEARCE Well youre not a common soldier OFlaherty youre a very
uncommon one and Im proud to have you for my guest here today

OFLAHERTY Sure I know sir You have to put up with a lot from the
like of me for the sake of the recruiting All the quality shakes hands
with me and says theyre proud to know me just the way the king said
when he pinned the Cross on me And its as true as Im standing here
sir the queen said to me I hear you were born on the estate of
General Madigan she says and the General himself tells me you
were always a fine young fellow Bedad Mam I says to her if
the General knew all the rabbits I snared on him and all the salmon
I snatched on him and all the cows I milked on him hed think me the
finest ornament for the county jail he ever sent there for poaching

SIR PEARCE Laughing Youre welcome to them all my lad Come he
makes him sit down again on the garden seat sit down and enjoy your
holiday he sits down on one of the iron chairs the one at the doorless
side of the porch

OFLAHERTY Holiday is it Id give five shillings to be back in the
trenches for the sake of a little rest and quiet I never knew what hard
work was till I took to recruiting What with the standing on my legs
all day and the shaking hands and the making speeches andwhats
worsethe listening to them and the calling for cheers for king and
country and the saluting the flag till Im stiff with it and the
listening to them playing God Save the King and Tipperary and the
trying to make my eyes look moist like a man in a picture book Im that
bet that I hardly get a wink of sleep I give you my word Sir Pearce
that I never heard the tune of Tipperary in my life till I came back
from Flanders and already its drove me to that pitch of tiredness
of it that when a poor little innocent slip of a boy in the street the
other night drew himself up and saluted and began whistling it at me I
clouted his head for him God forgive me

SIR PEARCE soothingly Yes yes I know I know One does get fed up
with it Ive been dog tired myself on parade many a time But still
you know theres a gratifying side to it too After all he is our
king and its our own country isnt it

OFLAHERTY Well sir to you that have an estate in it it would feel
like your country But the divil a perch of it ever I owned And as to
the king God help him my mother would have taken the skin off my back
if Id ever let on to have any other king than Parnell

SIR PEARCE rising painfully shocked Your mother What are you
dreaming about OFlaherty A most loyal woman Always most loyal
Whenever there is an illness in the Royal Family she asks me every
time we meet about the health of the patient as anxiously as if it were
yourself her only son

OFLAHERTY Well shes my mother and I wont utter a word agen her
But Im not saying a word of lie when I tell you that that old woman is
the biggest kanatt from here to the cross of Monasterboice Sure shes
the wildest Fenian and rebel and always has been that ever taught a
poor innocent lad like myself to pray night and morning to St Patrick
to clear the English out of Ireland the same as he cleared the snakes
Youll be surprised at my telling you that now maybe Sir Pearce

SIR PEARCE unable to keep still walking away from OFlaherty
Surprised Im more than surprised OFlaherty Im overwhelmed
Turning and facing him Are youare you joking

OFLAHERTY If youd been brought up by my mother sir youd know
better than to joke about her What Im telling you is the truth and I
wouldnt tell it to you if I could see my way to get out of the fix Ill
be in when my mother comes here this day to see her boy in his glory
and she after thinking all the time it was against the English I was
fighting

SIR PEARCE Do you mean to say you told her such a monstrous falsehood
as that you were fighting in the German army

OFLAHERTY I never told her one word that wasnt the truth and nothing
but the truth I told her I was going to fight for the French and for
the Russians and sure who ever heard of the French or the Russians
doing anything to the English but fighting them That was how it was
sir And sure the poor woman kissed me and went about the house singing
in her old cracky voice that the French was on the sea and theyd be
here without delay and the Orange will decay says the Shan Van Vocht

SIR PEARCE sitting down again exhausted by his feelings Well I
never could have believed this Never What do you suppose will happen
when she finds out

OFLAHERTY She mustnt find out Its not that shed half kill me as
big as I am and as brave as I am Its that Im fond of her and cant
bring myself to break the heart in her You may think it queer that a
man should be fond of his mother sir and she having bet him from the
time he could feel to the time she was too slow to ketch him but Im
fond of her and Im not ashamed of it Besides didnt she win the
Cross for me

SIR PEARCE Your mother How

OFLAHERTY By bringing me up to be more afraid of running away than of
fighting I was timid by nature and when the other boys hurted me Id
want to run away and cry But she whaled me for disgracing the blood of
the OFlahertys until Id have fought the divil himself sooner than face
her after funking a fight That was how I got to know that fighting was
easier than it looked and that the others was as much afeard of me as
I was of them and that if I only held out long enough theyd lose heart
and give rip Thats the way I came to be so courageous I tell you Sir
Pearce if the German army had been brought up by my mother the Kaiser
would be dining in the banqueting hall at Buckingham Palace this day
and King George polishing his jack boots for him in the scullery

SIR PEARCE But I dont like this OFlaherty You cant go on deceiving
your mother you know Its not right

OFLAHERTY Cant go on deceiving her cant I Its little you know
what a sons love can do sir Did you ever notice what a ready liar I
am

SIR PEARCE Well in recruiting a man gets carried away I stretch it
a bit occasionally myself After all its for king and country But if
you wont mind my saying it OFlaherty I think that story about
your fighting the Kaiser and the twelve giants of the Prussian guard
singlehanded would be the better for a little toning down I dont ask
you to drop it you know for its popular undoubtedly but still the
truth is the truth Dont you think it would fetch in almost as many
recruits if you reduced the number of guardsmen to six

OFLAHERTY Youre not used to telling lies like I am sir I got great
practice at home with my mother What with saving my skin when I was
young and thoughtless and sparing her feelings when I was old enough to
understand them Ive hardly told my mother the truth twice a year since
I was born and would you have me turn round on her and tell it now
when shes looking to have some peace and quiet in her old age

SIR PEARCE troubled in his conscience Well its not my affair of
course OFlaherty But hadnt you better talk to Father Quinlan about
it

OFLAHERTY Talk to Father Quinlan is it Do you know what Father
Quinlan says to me this very morning

SIR PEARCE Oh youve seen him already have you What did he say

OFLAHERTY He says You know dont you he says that its your
duty as a Christian and a good son of the Holy Church to love your
enemies he says I know its my juty as a soldier to kill them I
says Thats right Dinny he says quite right But says he you
can kill them and do them a good turn afterward to show your love for
them he says and its your duty to have a mass said for the souls of
the hundreds of Germans you say you killed says he for many and many
of them were Bavarians and good Catholics he says Is it me that must
pay for masses for the souls of the Boshes I says Let the King of
England pay for them I says for it was his quarrel and not mine

SIR PEARCE warmly It is the quarrel of every honest man and true
patriot OFlaherty Your mother must see that as clearly as I do
After all she is a reasonable well disposed woman quite capable of
understanding the right and the wrong of the war Why cant you explain
to her what the war is about

OFLAHERTY Arra sir how the divil do I know what the war is about

SIR PEARCE rising again and standing over him What OFlaherty do
you know what you are saying You sit there wearing the Victoria Cross
for having killed God knows how many Germans and you tell me you dont
know why you did it

OFLAHERTY Asking your pardon Sir Pearce I tell you no such thing I
know quite well why I kilt them because I was afeard that if I didnt
theyd kill me

SIR PEARCE giving it up and sitting down again Yes yes of course
but have you no knowledge of the causes of the war of the interests
at stake of the importanceI may almost sayin fact I will saythe
sacred right for which we are fighting Dont you read the papers

OFLAHERTY I do when I can get them Theres not many newsboys crying
the evening paper in the trenches They do say Sir Pearce that
we shall never beat the Boshes until we make Horatio Bottomley Lord
Leftnant of England Do you think thats true sir

SIR PEARCE Rubbish man theres no Lord Lieutenant in England the
king is Lord Lieutenant Its a simple question of patriotism Does
patriotism mean nothing to you

OFLAHERTY It means different to me than what it would to you sir It
means England and Englands king to you To me and the like of me it
means talking about the English just the way the English papers talk
about the Boshes And what good has it ever done here in Ireland Its
kept me ignorant because it filled up my mothers mind and she thought
it ought to fill up mine too Its kept Ireland poor because instead
of trying to better ourselves we thought we was the fine fellows of
patriots when we were speaking evil of Englishmen that was as poor as
ourselves and maybe as good as ourselves The Boshes I kilt was more
knowledgable men than me and what better am I now that Ive kilt them
What better is anybody

SIR PEARCE huffed turning a cold shoulder to him I am sorry the
terrible experience of this warthe greatest war ever foughthas
taught you no better OFlaherty

OFLAHERTY preserving his dignity I dont know about its being a
great war sir Its a big war but thats not the same thing Father
Quinlans new church is a big church you might take the little old
chapel out of the middle of it and not miss it But my mother says there
was more true religion in the old chapel And the war has taught me that
maybe she was right

SIR PEARCE grunts sulkily

OFLAHERTY respectfully but doggedly And theres another thing its
taught me too sir that concerns you and me if I may make bold to tell
it to you

SIR PEARCE still sulky I hope its nothing you oughtnt to say to me
OFlaherty

OFLAHERTY Its this sir that Im able to sit here now and talk to
you without humbugging you and thats what not one of your tenants or
your tenants childer ever did to you before in all your long life Its
a true respect Im showing you at last sir Maybe youd rather have me
humbug you and tell you lies as I used just as the boys here God help
them would rather have me tell them how I fought the Kaiser that all
the world knows I never saw in my life than tell them the truth But
I cant take advantage of you the way I used not even if I seem to be
wanting in respect to you and cocked up by winning the Cross

SIR PEARCE touched Not at all OFlaherty Not at all

OFLAHERTY Sure whats the Cross to me barring the little pension it
carries Do you think I dont know that theres hundreds of men as brave
as me that never had the luck to get anything for their bravery but a
curse from the sergeant and the blame for the faults of them that ought
to have been their betters Ive learnt more than youd think sir
for how would a gentleman like you know what a poor ignorant conceited
creature I was when I went from here into the wide world as a soldier
What use is all the lying and pretending and humbugging and letting
on when the day comes to you that your comrade is killed in the trench
beside you and you dont as much as look round at him until you trip
over his poor body and then all you say is to ask why the hell the
stretcherbearers dont take it out of the way Why should I read the
papers to be humbugged and lied to by them that had the cunning to
stay at home and send me to fight for them Dont talk to me or to any
soldier of the war being right No war is right and all the holy water
that Father Quinlan ever blessed couldnt make one right There sir
Now you know what OFlaherty VC thinks and youre wiser so than the
others that only knows what he done

SIR PEARCE making the best of it and turning goodhumoredly to him
again Well what you did was brave and manly anyhow

OFLAHERTY God knows whether it was or not better than you nor me
General I hope He wont be too hard on me for it anyhow

SIR PEARCE sympathetically Oh yes we all have to think seriously
sometimes especially when were a little run down Im afraid weve
been overworking you a bit over these recruiting meetings However we
can knock off for the rest of the day and tomorrows Sunday Ive
had about as much as I can stand myself He looks at his watch Its
teatime I wonder whats keeping your mother

OFLAHERTY Its nicely cocked up the old woman will be having tea at
the same table as you sir instead of in the kitchen Shell be after
dressing in the heighth of grandeur and stop she will at every house
on the way to show herself off and tell them where shes going and fill
the whole parish with spite and envy But sure she shouldnt keep you
waiting sir

SIR PEARCE Oh thats all right she must be indulged on an occasion
like this Im sorry my wife is in London shed have been glad to
welcome your mother

OFLAHERTY Sure I know she would sir She was always a kind friend to
the poor Little her ladyship knew God help her the depth of divilment
that was in us we were like a play to her You see sir she was
English that was how it was We was to her what the Pathans and
Senegalese was to me when I first seen them I couldnt think somehow
that they were liars and thieves and backbiters and drunkards just
like ourselves or any other Christians Oh her ladyship never knew all
that was going on behind her back how would she When I was a weeshy
child she gave me the first penny I ever had in my hand and I wanted
to pray for her conversion that night the same as my mother made me pray
for yours and

SIR PEARCE scandalized Do you mean to say that your mother made you
pray for MY conversion

OFLAHERTY Sure and she wouldnt want to see a gentleman like you going
to hell after she nursing your own son and bringing up my sister Annie
on the bottle That was how it was sir Shed rob you and shed lie to
you and shed call down all the blessings of God on your head when she
was selling you your own three geese that you thought had been ate by
the fox the day after youd finished fattening them sir and all the
time you were like a bit of her own flesh and blood to her Often has
she said shed live to see you a good Catholic yet leading victorious
armies against the English and wearing the collar of gold that Malachi
won from the proud invader Oh shes the romantic woman is my mother
and no mistake

SIR PEARCE in great perturbation I really cant believe this
OFlaherty I could have sworn your mother was as honest a woman as ever
breathed

OFLAHERTY And so she is sir Shes as honest as the day

SIR PEARCE Do you call it honest to steal my geese

OFLAHERTY She didnt steal them sir It was me that stole them

SIR PEARCE Oh And why the devil did you steal them

OFLAHERTY Sure we needed them sir Often and often we had to sell our
own geese to pay you the rent to satisfy your needs and why shouldnt
we sell your geese to satisfy ours

SIR PEARCE Well damn me

OFLAHERTY sweetly Sure you had to get what you could out of us and
we had to get what we could out of you God forgive us both

SIR PEARCE Really OFlaherty the war seems to have upset you a
little

OFLAHERTY Its set me thinking sir and Im not used to it Its like
the patriotism of the English They never thought of being patriotic
until the war broke out and now the patriotism has took them so
sudden and come so strange to them that they run about like frightened
chickens uttering all manner of nonsense But please God theyll forget
all about it when the wars over Theyre getting tired of it already

SIR PEARCE No no it has uplifted us all in a wonderful way The world
will never be the same again OFlaherty Not after a war like this

OFLAHERTY So they all say sir I see no great differ myself Its all
the fright and the excitement and when that quiets down theyll go
back to their natural divilment and be the same as ever Its like the
vermin itll wash off after a while

SIR PEARCE rising and planting himself firmly behind the garden seat
Well the long and the short of it is OFlaherty I must decline to be
a party to any attempt to deceive your mother I thoroughly disapprove
of this feeling against the English especially at a moment like the
present Even if your mothers political sympathies are really what you
represent them to be I should think that her gratitude to Gladstone
ought to cure her of such disloyal prejudices

OFLAHERTY over his shoulder She says Gladstone was an Irishman Sir
What call would he have to meddle with Ireland as he did if he wasnt

SIR PEARCE What nonsense Does she suppose Mr Asquith is an Irishman

OFLAHERTY She wont give him any credit for Home Rule Sir She says
Redmond made him do it She says you told her so

SIR PEARCE convicted out of his own mouth Well I never meant her to
take it up in that ridiculous way He moves to the end of the garden
seat on OFlahertys left Ill give her a good talking to when she
comes Im not going to stand any of her nonsense

OFLAHERTY Its not a bit of use sir She says all the English
generals is Irish She says all the English poets and great men was
Irish She says the English never knew how to read their own books until
we taught them She says were the lost tribes of the house of Israel
and the chosen people of God She says that the goddess Venus that was
born out of the foam of the sea came up out of the water in Killiney
Bay off Bray Head She says that Moses built the seven churches and
that Lazarus was buried in Glasnevin

SIR PEARCE Bosh How does she know he was Did you ever ask her

OFLAHERTY I did sir often

SIR PEARCE And what did she say

OFLAHERTY She asked me how did I know he wasnt and fetched me a
clout on the side of my head

SIR PEARCE But have you never mentioned any famous Englishman to her
and asked her what she had to say about him

OFLAHERTY The only one I could think of was Shakespeare sir and she
says he was born in Cork

SIR PEARCE exhausted Well I give it up he throws himself into the
nearest chair The woman isOh well No matter

OFLAHERTY sympathetically Yes sir shes pigheaded and obstinate
theres no doubt about it Shes like the English they think theres
no one like themselves Its the same with the Germans though theyre
educated and ought to know better Youll never have a quiet world till
you knock the patriotism out of the human race

SIR PEARCE Still we

OFLAHERTY Whisht sir for Gods sake here she is

The General jumps up Mrs OFlaherty arrives and comes between the
two men She is very clean and carefully dressed in the old fashioned
peasant costume black silk sunbonnet with a tiara of trimmings and
black cloak

OFLAHERTY rising shyly Good evening mother

MRS OFLAHERTY severely You hold your whisht and learn behavior
while I pay my juty to his honor To Sir Pearce heartily And how
is your honors good self And how is her ladyship and all the young
ladies Oh its right glad we are to see your honor back again and
looking the picture of health

SIR PEARCE forcing a note of extreme geniality Thank you Mrs
OFlaherty Well you see weve brought you back your son safe and
sound I hope youre proud of him

MRS OFLAHERTY And indeed and I am your honor Its the brave boy he
is and why wouldnt he be brought up on your honors estate and with
you before his eyes for a pattern of the finest soldier in Ireland
Come and kiss your old mother Dinny darlint OFlaherty does so
sheepishly Thats my own darling boy And look at your fine new
uniform stained already with the eggs youve been eating and the porter
youve been drinking She takes out her handkerchief spits on it and
scrubs his lapel with it Oh its the untidy slovenly one you always
were There It wont be seen on the khaki its not like the old red
coat that would show up everything that dribbled down on it To Sir
Pearce And they tell me down at the lodge that her ladyship is
staying in London and that Miss Agnes is to be married to a fine young
nobleman Oh its your honor that is the lucky and happy father It
will be bad news for many of the young gentlemen of the quality round
here sir Theres lots thought she was going to marry young Master
Lawless

SIR PEARCE What Thatthatthat bosthoon

MRS OFLAHERTY hilariously Let your honor alone for finding the right
word A big bosthoon he is indeed your honor Oh to think of the times
and times I have said that Miss Agnes would be my lady as her mother was
before her Didnt I Dinny

SIR PEARCE And now Mrs OFlaherty I daresay you have a great deal to
say to Dennis that doesnt concern me Ill just go in and order tea

MRS OFLAHERTY Oh why would your honor disturb yourself Sure I can
take the boy into the yard

SIR PEARCE Not at all It wont disturb me in the least And hes too
big a boy to be taken into the yard now He has made a front seat for
himself Eh He goes into the house

MRS OFLAHERTY Sure he has that your honor God bless your honor The
General being now out of hearing she turns threateningly to her
son with one of those sudden Irish changes of manner which amaze and
scandalize less flexible nations and exclaims And what do you mean
you lying young scald by telling me you were going to fight agen the
English Did you take me for a fool that couldnt find out and the
papers all full of you shaking hands with the English king at Buckingham
Palace

OFLAHERTY I didnt shake hands with him he shook hands with me Could
I turn on the man in his own house before his own wife with his money
in my pocket and in yours and throw his civility back in his face

MRS OFLAHERTY You would take the hand of a tyrant red with the blood
of Ireland

OFLAHERTY Arra hold your nonsense mother hes not half the tyrant
you are God help him His hand was cleaner than mine that had the blood
of his own relations on it maybe

MRS OFLAHERTY threateningly Is that a way to speak to your mother
you young spalpeen

OFLAHERTY stoutly It is so if you wont talk sense to me Its a
nice thing for a poor boy to be made much of by kings and queens and
shook hands with by the heighth of his countrys nobility in the capital
cities of the world and then to come home and be scolded and insulted
by his own mother Ill fight for who I like and Ill shake hands with
what kings I like and if your own son is not good enough for you you
can go and look for another Do you mind me now

MRS OFLAHERTY And was it the Belgians learned you such brazen
impudence

OFLAHERTY The Belgians is good men and the French ought to be more
civil to them let alone their being half murdered by the Boshes

MRS OFLAHERTY Good men is it Good men to come over here when they
were wounded because it was a Catholic country and then to go to the
Protestant Church because it didnt cost them anything and some of them
to never go near a church at all Thats what you call good men

OFLAHERTY Oh youre the mighty fine politician arent you Much you
know about Belgians or foreign parts or the world youre living in God
help you

MRS OFLAHERTY Why wouldnt I know better than you Amment I your
mother

OFLAHERTY And if you are itself how can you know what you never seen
as well as me that was dug into the continent of Europe for six months
and was buried in the earth of it three times with the shells bursting
on the top of me I tell you I know what Im about I have my own
reasons for taking part in this great conflict Id be ashamed to stay
at home and not fight when everybody else is fighting

MRS OFLAHERTY If you wanted to fight why couldnt you fight in the
German army

OFLAHERTY Because they only get a penny a day

MRS OFLAHERTY Well and if they do itself isnt there the French
army

OFLAHERTY They only get a hapenny a day

MRS OFLAHERTY much dashed Oh murder They must be a mean lot Dinny

OFLAHERTY sarcastic Maybe youd have me in the Turkish army and
worship the heathen Mahomet that put a corn in his ear and pretended it
was a message from the heavens when the pigeon come to pick it out and
eat it I went where I could get the biggest allowance for you and
little thanks I get for it

MRS OFLAHERTY Allowance is it Do you know what the thieving
blackguards did on me They came to me and they says Was your son a
big eater they says Oh he was that says I ten shillings a week
wouldnt keep him Sure I thought the more I said the more theyd give
me Then says they thats ten shillings a week off your allowance
they says because you save that by the king feeding him Indeed
says I I suppose if Id six sons youd stop three pound a week from
me and make out that I ought to pay you money instead of you paying
me Theres a fallacy in your argument they says

OFLAHERTY A what

MRS OFLAHERTY A fallacy thats the word he said I says to him Its
a Pharisee Im thinking you mean sir but you can keep your dirty money
that your king grudges a poor old widow and please God the English will
be got yet for the deadly sin of oppressing the poor and with that I
shut the door in his face

OFLAHERTY furious Do you tell me they knocked ten shillings off you
for my keep

MRS OFLAHERTY soothing him No darlint they only knocked off half
a crown I put up with it because Ive got the old age pension and they
know very well Im only sixtytwo so Ive the better of them by half a
crown a week anyhow

OFLAHERTY Its a queer way of doing business If theyd tell you
straight out what they was going to give you you wouldnt mind but if
there was twenty ways of telling the truth and only one way of telling a
lie the Government would find it out Its in the nature of governments
to tell lies

Teresa Driscoll a parlor maid comes from the house

TERESA Youre to come up to the drawingroom to have your tea Mrs
OFlaherty

MRS OFLAHERTY Mind you have a sup of good black tea for me in the
kitchen afterwards acushla That washy drawingroom tea will give me
the wind if I leave it on my stomach She goes into the house leaving
the two young people alone together

OFLAHERTY Is that yourself Tessie And how are you

TERESA Nicely thank you And hows yourself

OFLAHERTY Finely thank God He produces a gold chain Look what
Ive brought you Tessie

TERESA shrinking Sure I dont like to touch it Denny Did you take
it off a dead man

OFLAHERTY No I took it off a live one and thankful he was to me to
be alive and kept a prisoner in ease and comfort and me left fighting
in peril of my life

TERESA taking it Do you think its real gold Denny

OFLAHERTY Its real German gold anyhow

TERESA But German silver isnt real Denny

OFLAHERTY his face darkening Well its the best the Bosh could do
for me anyhow

TERESA Do you think I might take it to the jeweller next market day and
ask him

OFLAHERTY sulkily You may take it to the divil if you like

TERESA You neednt lose your temper about it I only thought Id like
to know The nice fool Id look if I went about showing off a chain that
turned out to be only brass

OFLAHERTY I think you might say Thank you

TERESA Do you I think you might have said something more to me than
Is that yourself You couldnt say less to the postman

OFLAHERTY his brow clearing Oh is that whats the matter Here
come and take the taste of ther brass out of my mouth He seizes her
and kisses her

Teresa without losing her Irish dignity takes the kiss as
appreciatively as a connoisseur might take a glass of wine and sits
down with him on the garden seat

TERESA as he squeezes her waist Thank God the priest cant see us
here

OFLAHERTY Its little they care for priests in France alanna

TERESA And what had the queen on her Denny when she spoke to you in
the palace

OFLAHERTY She had a bonnet on without any strings to it And she had
a plakeen of embroidery down her bosom And she had her waist where it
used to be and not where the other ladies had it And she had little
brooches in her ears though she hadnt half the jewelry of Mrs Sullivan
that keeps the popshop in Drumpogue And she dresses her hair down over
her forehead in a fringe like And she has an Irish look about her
eyebrows And she didnt know what to say to me poor woman and I
didnt know what to say to her God help me

TERESA Youll have a pension now with the Cross wont you Denny

OFLAHERTY Sixpence three farthings a day

TERESA That isnt much

OFLAHERTY I take out the rest in glory

TERESA And if youre wounded youll have a wound pension wont you

OFLAHERTY I will please God

TERESA Youre going out again arent you Denny

OFLAHERTY I cant help myself Id be shot for a deserter if I didnt

of them Im nicely fixed up

MRS OFLAHERTY calling from within the house Tessie Tessie darlint

TERESA disengaging herself from his arm and rising Im wanted for
the tea table Youll have a pension anyhow Denny wont you whether

MRS OFLAHERTY Come child come

TERESA impatiently Oh sure Im coming She tries to smile at Denny
not very convincingly and hurries into the house

OFLAHERTY alone And if I do get a pension itself the divil a penny
of it youll ever have the spending of

MRS OFLAHERTY as she comes from the porch Oh its a shame for you
to keep the girl from her juties Dinny You might get her into trouble

OFLAHERTY Much I care whether she gets into trouble or not I pity the
man that gets her into trouble Hell get himself into worse

MRS OFLAHERTY Whats that you tell me Have you been falling out with
her and she a girl with a fortune of ten pounds

OFLAHERTY Let her keep her fortune I wouldnt touch her with the
tongs if she had thousands and millions

MRS OFLAHERTY Oh fie for shame Dinny why would you say the like of
that of a decent honest girl and one of the Driscolls too

OFLAHERTY Why wouldnt I say it Shes thinking of nothing but to get
me out there again to be wounded so that she may spend my pension bad
scran to her

MRS OFLAHERTY Why whats come over you child at all at all

OFLAHERTY Knowledge and wisdom has come over me with pain and fear
and trouble Ive been made a fool of and imposed upon all my life I
thought that covetious sthreal in there was a walking angel and now if
ever I marry at all Ill marry a Frenchwoman

MRS OFLARERTY fiercely Youll not so and dont you dar repeat such
a thing to me

OFLAHERTY Wont I faith Ive been as good as married to a couple of
them already

MRS OFLAHERTY The Lord be praised what wickedness have you been up
to you young blackguard

OFLAHERTY One of them Frenchwomen would cook you a meal twice in the
day and all days and every day that Sir Pearce himself might go begging
through Ireland for and never see the like of Ill have a French wife
I tell you and when I settle down to be a farmer Ill have a French
farm with a field as big as the continent of Europe that ten of your
dirty little fields here wouldnt so much as fill the ditch of

MRS OFLAHERTY furious Then its a French mother you may go look for
for Im done with you

OFLAHERTY And its no great loss youd be if it wasnt for my natural
feelings for you for its only a silly ignorant old countrywoman you
are with all your fine talk about Ireland you that never stepped beyond
the few acres of it you were born on

MRS OFLAHERTY tottering to the garden seat and showing signs of
breaking down Dinny darlint why are you like this to me Whats
happened to you

OFLAHERTY gloomily Whats happened to everybody thats what I want
to know Whats happened to you that I thought all the world of and was
afeard of Whats happened to Sir Pearce that I thought was a great
general and that I now see to be no more fit to command an army than an
old hen Whats happened to Tessie that I was mad to marry a year ago
and that I wouldnt take now with all Ireland for her fortune I tell
you the worlds creation is crumbling in ruins about me and then you
come and ask whats happened to me

MRS OFLAHERTY giving way to wild grief Ochone ochone my sons
turned agen me Oh whatll I do at all at all Oh oh oh oh

SIR PEARCE running out of the house Whats this infernal noise What
on earth is the matter

OFLAHERTY Arra hold your whisht mother Dont you see his honor

MRS OFLAHERTY Oh Sir Im ruined and destroyed Oh wont you
speak to Dinny Sir Im heart scalded with him He wants to marry a
Frenchwoman on me and to go away and be a foreigner and desert his
mother and betray his country Its mad he is with the roaring of the
cannons and he killing the Germans and the Germans killing him bad cess
to them My boy is taken from me and turned agen me and who is to take
care of me in my old age after all Ive done for him ochone ochone

OFLAHERTY Hold your noise I tell you Whos going to leave you Im
going to take you with me There now does that satisfy you

MRS OFLAHERTY Is it take me into a strange land among heathens and
pagans and savages and me not knowing a word of their language nor them
of mine

OFLAHERTY A good job they dont maybe theyll think youre talking
sense

MRS OFLAHERTY Ask me to die out of Ireland is it and the angels not
to find me when they come for me

OFLAHERTY And would you ask me to live in Ireland where Ive been
imposed on and kept in ignorance and to die where the divil himself
wouldnt take me as a gift let alone the blessed angels You can come
or stay You can take your old way or take my young way But stick in
this place I will not among a lot of goodfornothing divils thatll not
do a hands turn but watch the grass growing and build up the stone wall
where the cow walked through it And Sir Horace Plunkett breaking his
heart all the time telling them how they might put the land into decent
tillage like the French and Belgians

SIR PEARCE Yes hes quite right you know Mrs OFlaherty quite right
there

MRS OFLAHERTY Well sir please God the war will last a long time yet
and maybe Ill die before its over and the separation allowance stops

OFLAHERTY Thats all you care about Its nothing but milch cows we
men are for the women with their separation allowances ever since the
war began bad luck to them that made it

TERESA coming from the porch between the General and Mrs OFlaherty
Hannah sent me out for to tell you sir that the tea will be black and
the cake not fit to eat with the cold if yous all dont come at wanst

MRS OFLAHERTY breaking out again Oh Tessie darlint what have you
been saying to Dinny at all at all Oh Oh

SIR PEARCE out of patience You cant discuss that here We shall have
Tessie beginning now

OFLAHERTY Thats right sir drive them in

TERESA I havent said a word to him He

SIR PEARCE Hold your tongue and go in and attend to your business at
the tea table

TERESA But amment I telling your honor that I never said a word to him
He gave me a beautiful gold chain Here it is to show your honor that
its no lie Im telling you

SIR PEARCE Whats this OFlaherty Youve been looting some
unfortunate officer

OFLAHERTY No sir I stole it from him of his own accord

MRS OFLAHERTY Wouldnt your honor tell him that his mother has the
first call on it What would a slip of a girl like that be doing with a
gold chain round her neck

TERESA venomously Anyhow I have a neck to put it round and not a
hank of wrinkles

At this unfortunate remark Mrs OFlaherty bounds from her seat and
an appalling tempest of wordy wrath breaks out The remonstrances and
commands of the General and the protests and menaces of OFlaherty
only increase the hubbub They are soon all speaking at once at the top
of their voices

MRS OFLAHERTY solo You impudent young heifer how dar you say such a
thing to me Teresa retorts furiously the men interfere and the solo
becomes a quartet fortissimo Ive a good mind to clout your ears for
you to teach you manners Be ashamed of yourself do and learn to know
who youre speaking to That I maytnt sin but I dont know what the
good God was thinking about when he made the like of you Let me not see
you casting sheeps eyes at my son again There never was an OFlaherty
yet that would demean himself by keeping company with a dirty Driscoll
and if I see you next or nigh my house Ill put you in the ditch with a
flea in your ear mind that now

TERESA Is it me you offer such a name to you foumouthed
dirtyminded lying sloothering old sow you I wouldnt soil my tongue
by calling you in your right name and telling Sir Pearce whats the
common talk of the town about you You and your OFlahertys setting
yourself up agen the Driscolls that would never lower themselves to be
seen in conversation with you at the fair You can keep your ugly stingy
lump of a son for what is he but a common soldier and God help
the girl that gets him say I So the back of my hand to you Mrs
OFlaherty and that the cat may tear your ugly old face

SIR PEARCE Silence Tessie did you hear me ordering you to go into the
house Mrs OFlaherty Louder Mrs OFlaherty Will you just listen
to me one moment Please Furiously Do you hear me speaking to you
woman Are you human beings or are you wild beasts Stop that noise
immediately do you hear Yelling Are you going to do what I order
you or are you not Scandalous Disgraceful This comes of being too
familiar with you OFlaherty shove them into the house Out with the
whole damned pack of you

OFLAHERTY to the women Here now none of that none of that Go
easy I tell you Hold your whisht mother will you or youll be sorry
for it after To Teresa Is that the way for a decent young girl to
speak Despairingly Oh for the Lords sake shut up will yous Have
you no respect for yourselves or your betters Peremptorily Let me
have no more of it I tell you Och the divils in the whole crew of
you In with you into the house this very minute and tear one anothers
eyes out in the kitchen if you like In with you

The two men seize the two women and push them still violently abusing
one another into the house Sir Pearce slams the door upon them
savagely Immediately a heavenly silence falls on the summer afternoon
The two sit down out of breath and for a long time nothing is said Sir
Pearce sits on an iron chair OFlaherty sits on the garden seat The
thrush begins to sing melodiously OFlaherty cocks his ears and looks
up at it A smile spreads over his troubled features Sir Pearce with a
long sigh takes out his pipe and begins to fill it

OFLAHERTY idyllically What a discontented sort of an animal a man
is sir Only a month ago I was in the quiet of the country out at the
front with not a sound except the birds and the bellow of a cow in the
distance as it might be and the shrapnel making little clouds in the
heavens and the shells whistling and maybe a yell or two when one of
us was hit and would you believe it sir I complained of the noise and
wanted to have a peaceful hour at home Well them two has taught me a
lesson This morning sir when I was telling the boys here how I was
longing to be back taking my part for king and country with the others
I was lying as you well knew sir Now I can go and say it with a clear
conscience Some likes wars alarums and some likes home life Ive
tried both sir and Im for wars alarums now I always was a quiet lad
by natural disposition

SIR PEARCE Strictly between ourselves OFlaherty and as one soldier
to another OFlaherty salutes but without stiffening do you think we
should have got an army without conscription if domestic life had been
as happy as people say it is

OFLAHERTY Well between you and me and the wall Sir Pearce I think
the less we say about that until the wars over the better

He winks at the General The General strikes a match The thrush sings
A jay laughs The conversation drops
