CRAIG KENNEDYS THEORIES

It has always seemed strange to me that no one has ever endowed a
professorship in criminal science in any of our large universities

Craig Kennedy laid down his evening paper and filled his pipe with my
tobacco In college we had roomed together had shared everything even
poverty and now that Craig was a professor of chemistry and I was on
the staff of the Star we had continued the arrangement Prosperity
found us in a rather neat bachelor apartment on the Heights not far
from the University

Why should there be a chair in criminal science I remarked
argumentatively settling back in my chair Ive done my turn at police
headquarters reporting and I can tell you Craig its no place for a
college professor Crime is just crime And as for dealing with it
the good detective is born and bred to it College professors for the
sociology of the thing yes for the detection of it give me a Byrnes

On the contrary replied Kennedy his cleancut features betraying an
earnestness which I knew indicated that he was leading up to something
important there is a distinct place for science in the detection of
crime On the Continent they are far in advance of us in that respect
We are mere children beside a dozen crimespecialists in Paris whom I
could name

Yes but where does the college professor come in I asked rather
doubtfully

You must remember Walter he pursued warming up to his subject
that its only within the last ten years or so that we have had the
really practical college professor who could do it The silkstockinged
variety is out of date now Today it is the college professor who is
the third arbitrator in labour disputes who reforms our currency who
heads our tariff commissions and conserves our farms and forests We
have professors of everythingwhy not professors of crime

Still as I shook my head dubiously he hurried on to clinch his point
Colleges have gone a long way from the old ideal of pure culture They
have got down to solving the hard facts of lifepretty nearly all
except one They still treat crime in the old way study its statistics
and pore over its causes and the theories of how it can be prevented
But as for running the criminal himself down scientifically
relentlesslybah we havent made an inch of progress since the hammer
and tongs method of your Byrnes

Doubtless you will write a thesis on this most interesting subject I
suggested and let it go at that

No I am serious he replied determined for some reason or other to
make a convert of me I mean exactly what I say I am going to apply
science to the detection of crime the same sort of methods by which you
trace out the presence of a chemical or run an unknown germ to earth
And before I have gone far I am going to enlist Walter Jameson as an
aide I think I shall need you in my business

How do I come in

Well for one thing you will get a scoop a beatwhatever you call
it in that newspaper jargon of yours

I smiled in a skeptical way such as newspapermen are wont to affect
toward a thing until it is doneafter which we make a wild scramble to
exploit it

Nothing more on the subject passed between us for several days




I The Silent Bullet

Detectives in fiction nearly always make a great mistake said Kennedy
one evening after our first conversation on crime and science They
almost invariably antagonize the regular detective force Now in real
life thats impossibleits fatal

Yes I agreed looking up from reading an account of the failure of a
large Wall Street brokerage house Kerr Parker  Co and the peculiar
suicide of Kerr Parker Yes its impossible just as it is impossible
for the regular detectives to antagonize the newspapers Scotland Yard
found that out in the Crippen case

My idea of the thing Jameson continued Kennedy is that the
professor of criminal science ought to work with not against the
regular detectives Theyre all right Theyre indispensable of course
Half the secret of success nowadays is organisation The professor of
criminal science should be merely what the professor in a technical
school often isa sort of consulting engineer For instance I believe
that organisation plus science would go far toward clearing up that Wall
Street case I see you are reading

I expressed some doubt as to whether the regular police were enlightened
enough to take that view of it

Some of them are he replied Yesterday the chief of police in a
Western city sent a man East to see me about the Price murder you know
the case

Indeed I did A wealthy banker of the town had been murdered on the
road to the golf club no one knew why or by whom Every clue had proved
fruitless and the list of suspects was itself so long and so impossible
as to seem most discouraging

He sent me a piece of a torn handkerchief with a deep bloodstain on
it pursued Kennedy He said it clearly didnt belong to the murdered
man that it indicated that the murderer had himself been wounded in the
tussle but as yet it had proved utterly valueless as a clue Would I
see what I could make of it

After his man had told me the story I had a feeling that the murder was
committed by either a Sicilian labourer on the links or a negro waiter
at the club Well to make a short story shorter I decided to test the
bloodstain Probably you didnt know it but the Carnegie Institution
has just published a minute careful and dry study of the blood of
human beings and of animals

In fact they have been able to reclassify the whole animal kingdom
on this basis and have made some most surprising additions to our
knowledge of evolution Now I dont propose to bore you with the details
of the tests but one of the things they showed was that the blood of a
certain branch of the human race gives a reaction much like the blood of
a certain group of monkeys the chimpanzees while the blood of another
branch gives a reaction like that of the gorilla Of course theres lots
more to it but this is all that need concern us now

I tried the tests The blood on the handkerchief conformed strictly
to the latter test Now the gorilla was of course out of the
questionthis was no Rue Morgue murder Therefore it was the negro
waiter

But I interrupted the negro offered a perfect alibi at the start
and

No buts Walter Heres a telegram I received at dinner
Congratulations Confronted Jackson your evidence as wired
Confessed

Well Craig I take off my hat to you I exclaimed Next youll be
solving this Kerr Parker case for sure

I would take a hand in it if theyd let me said he simply

That night without saying anything I sauntered down to the imposing
new police building amid the squalor of Center Street They were very
busy at headquarters but having once had that assignment for the Star
I had no trouble in getting in Inspector Barney OConnor of the Central
Office carefully shifted a cigar from corner to corner of his mouth as I
poured forth my suggestion to him

Well Jameson he said at length do you think this professor fellow
is the goods

I didnt mince matters in my opinion of Kennedy I told him of the Price
case and showed him a copy of the telegram That settled it

Can you bring him down here tonight he asked quickly

I reached for the telephone found Craig in his laboratory finally and
in less than an hour he was in the office

This is a most bating case Professor Kennedy this case of Kerr
Parker said the inspector launching at once into his subject Here
is a broker heavily interested in Mexican rubber It looks like a good
thingplantations right in the same territory as those of the Rubber
Trust Now in addition to that he is branching out into coastwise
steamship lines another man associated with him is heavily engaged in
a railway scheme from the United States down into Mexico Altogether the
steamships and railroads are tapping rubber oil copper and I dont
know what other regions Here in New York they have been pyramiding
stocks borrowing money from two trust companies which they control
Its a lovely schemeyouve read about it I suppose Also youve read
that it comes into competition with a certain group of capitalists whom
we will call the System

Well this depression in the market comes along At once rumours are
spread about the weakness of the trust companies runs start on both of
them The Systemyou know themmake a great show of supporting the
market Yet the runs continue God knows whether they will spread or the
trust companies stand up under it tomorrow after what happened today
It was a good thing the market was closed when it happened

Kerr Parker was surrounded by a group of people who were in his schemes
with him They are holding a council of war in the directors room
Suddenly Parker rises staggers toward the window falls and is dead
before a doctor can get to him Every effort is made to keep the thing
quiet It is given out that he committed suicide The papers dont seem
to accept the suicide theory however Neither do we The coroner who
is working with us has kept his mouth shut so far and will say nothing
till the inquest For Professor Kennedy my first man on the spot found
thatKerr Parkerwasmurdered

Now here comes the amazing part of the story The doors to the offices
on both sides were open at the time There were lots of people in each
office There was the usual click of typewriters and the buzz of the
ticker and the hum of conversation We have any number of witnesses of
the whole affair but as far as any of them knows no shot was fired no
smoke was seen no noise was heard nor was any weapon found Yet here
on my desk is a thirtytwocalibre bullet The coroners physician
probed it out of Parkers neck this afternoon and turned it over to us

Kennedy reached for the bullet and turned it thoughtfully in his
fingers for a moment One side of it had apparently struck a bone in the
neck of the murdered man and was flattened The other side was still
perfectly smooth With his inevitable magnifyingglass he scrutinised
the bullet on every side I watched his face anxiously and I could see
that he was very intent and very excited

Extraordinary most extraordinary he said to himself as he turned it
over and over Where did you say this bullet struck

In the fleshy part of the neck quite a little back of and below his
ear and just above his collar There wasnt much bleeding I think it
must have struck the base of his brain

It didnt strike his collar or hair

No replied the inspector

Inspector I think we shall be able to put our hands on the murdererI
think we can get a conviction sir on the evidence that I shall get
from this bullet in my laboratory

Thats pretty much like a storybook drawled the inspector
incredulously shaking his head

Perhaps smiled Kennedy But there will still be plenty of work for
the police to do too Ive only got a clue to the murderer It will
take the whole organisation to follow it up believe me Now Inspector
can you spare the time to go down to Parkers office and take me over
the ground No doubt we can develop something else there

Sure answered OConnor and within five minutes we were hurrying down
town in one of the department automobiles

We found the office under guard of one of the Central Office men while
in the outside office Parkers confidential clerk and a few assistants
were still at work in a subdued and awed manner Men were working in
many other Wall Street offices that night during the panic but in none
was there more reason for it than here Later I learned that it was the
quiet tenacity of this confidential clerk that saved even as much of
Parkers estate as was saved for his widowlittle enough it was too
What he saved for the clients of the firm no one will ever know
Somehow or other I liked John Downey the clerk from the moment I
was introduced to him He seemed to me at least to be the typical
confidential clerk who would carry a secret worth millions and keep it

The officer in charge touched his hat to the inspector and Downey
hastened to put himself at our service It was plain that the murder had
completely mystified him and that he was as anxious as we were to get
at the bottom of it

Mr Downey began Kennedy I understand you were present when this
sad event took place

Yes sir sitting right here at the directors table he replied
taking a chair like this

Now can you recollect just how Mr Parker acted when he was shot Could
youercould you take his place and show us just how it happened

Yes sir said Downey He was sitting here at the head of the table
Mr Bruce who is the CO of the firm had been sitting here at his
right I was at the left The inspector has a list of all the others
present That door to the right was open and Mrs Parker and some other
ladies were in the room

Mrs Parker broke in Kennedy

Yes Like a good many brokerage firms we have a ladies room Many
ladies are among our clients We make a point of catering to them At
that time I recollect the door was openall the doors were open It
was not a secret meeting Mr Bruce had just gone into the ladies
department I think to ask some of them to stand by the firmhe was
an artist at smoothing over the fears of customers particularly women
Just before he went in I had seen the ladies go in a group toward the
far end of the roomto look down at the line of depositors on the
street which reached around the corner from one of the trust companies
I thought I was making a note of an order to send into the outside
office there on the left and had just pushed this button here under the
table to call a boy to carry it Mr Parker had just received a letter
by special delivery and seemed considerably puzzled over it No I
dont know what it was about Of a sudden I saw him start in his chair
rise up unsteadily clap his hand on the back of his head stagger
across the floorlike thisand fall here

Then what happened

Why I rushed to pick him up Everything was confusion I recall
someone behind me saying Here boy take all these papers off
the table and carry them into my office before they get lost in the
excitement I think it was Bruces voice The next moment I heard
someone say Stand back Mrs Parker has fainted But I didnt pay
much attention for I was calling to someone not to get a doctor over
the telephone but to go down to the fifth floor where one has an
office I made Mr Parker as comfortable as I could There wasnt much
I could do He seemed to want to say something to me but he couldnt
talk He was paralysed at least his throat was But I did manage to
make out finally what sounded to me like Tell her I dont believe the
scandal I dont believe it But before he could say whom to tell he
had again become unconscious and by the time the doctor arrived he was
dead I guess you know everything else as well as I do

You didnt hear the shot fired from any particular direction asked
Kennedy

No sir

Well where do you think it came from

Thats what puzzles me sir The only thing I can figure out is that it
was fired from the outside officeperhaps by some customer who had lost
money and sought revenge But no one out there heard it either any more
than they did in the directors room or the ladies department

About that message asked Kennedy ignoring what to me seemed to
be the most important feature of the case the mystery of the silent
bullet Didnt you see it after all was over

No sir in fact I had forgotten about it till this moment when you
asked me to reconstruct the circumstances exactly No sir I dont
know a thing about it I cant say it impressed itself on my mind at the
time either

What did Mrs Parker do when she came to

Oh she cried as I have never seen a woman cry before He was dead by
that time of course

Bruce and I saw her down in the elevator to her car In fact the
doctor who had arrived said that the sooner she was taken home the
better she would be She was quite hysterical

Did she say anything that you remember

Downey hesitated

Out with it Downey said the inspector What did she say as she was
going down in the elevator

Nothing

Tell us Ill arrest you if you dont

Nothing about the murder on my honour protested Downey

Kennedy leaned over suddenly and shot a remark at him Then it was
about the note

Downey was surprised but not quickly enough Still he seemed to be
considering something and in a moment he said

I dont know what it was about but I feel it is my duty after all to
tell you I heard her say I wonder if he knew

Nothing else

Nothing else

What happened after you came back

We entered the ladies department No one was there A womans
automobilecoat was thrown over a chair in a heap Mr Bruce picked it
up Its Mrs Parkers he said He wrapped it up hastily and rang
for a messenger

Where did he send it

To Mrs Parker I suppose I didnt hear the address

We next went over the whole suite of offices conducted by Mr Downey I
noted how carefully Kennedy looked into the directors room through the
open door from the ladies department He stood at such an angle that
had he been the assassin he could scarcely have been seen except by
those sitting immediately next Mr Parker at the directors table The
street windows were directly in front of him and back of him was the
chair on which the motorcoat had been found

In Parkers own office we spent some time as well as in Bruces
Kennedy made a search for the note but finding nothing in either
office turned out the contents of Bruces scrapbasket There didnt
seem to be anything in it to interest him however even after he had
pieced several torn bits of scraps together with much difficulty and
he was about to turn the papers back again when he noticed something
sticking to the side of the basket It looked like a mass of wet paper
and that was precisely what it was

Thats queer said Kennedy picking it loose Then he wrapped it up
carefully and put it in his pocket Inspector can you lend me one of
your men for a couple of days he asked as we were preparing to leave
I shall want to send him out of town tonight and shall probably need
his services when he gets back

Very well Riley will be just the fellow Well go back to
headquarters and Ill put him under your orders

It was not until late in the following day that I saw Kennedy again
It had been a busy day at the Star We had gone to work that morning
expecting to see the very financial heavens fall But just about five
minutes to ten before the Stock Exchange opened the news came in
over the wire from our financial man on Broad Street The System has
forced James Bruce partner of Kerr Parker the dead banker to sell
his railroad steamship and rubber holdings to it On this condition it
promises unlimited support to the market

Forced muttered the managing editor as he waited on the office phone
to get the composingroom so as to hurry up the few lines in red ink on
the first page and beat our rivals on the streets with the first extras
Why hes been working to bring that about for the past two weeks What
that System doesnt control isnt worth havingit edits the news before
our men get it and as for grist for the divorce courts and tragedies
wellHello Jenkins yes a special extra Change the big headscopy
is on the way uprush it

So you think this Parker case is a mess I asked

I know it Thats a pretty swift bunch of females that have
been speculating at Kerr Parker  Cos I understand theres one
Titianhaired young ladywho by the way has at least one husband who
hasnt yet been divorcedwho is a sort of ringleader though she rarely
goes personally to her brokers offices Shes one of those uptown
plungers and the story is that she has a whole string of scalps of
alleged Sundayschool superintendents at her belt She can make Bruce
do pretty nearly anything they say Hes the latest conquest I got the
story on pretty good authority but until I verified the names dates
and places of course I wouldnt dare print a line of it The story
goes that her husband is a hangeron of the System and that shes been
working in their interest too That was why he was so complacent over
the whole affair They put her up to capturing Bruce and after she had
acquired an influence over him they worked it so that she made him make
love to Mrs Parker Its a long story but that isnt all of it The
point was you see that by this devious route they hoped to worm out of
Mrs Parker some inside information about Parkers rubber schemes which
he hadnt divulged even to his partners in business It was a deep and
carefully planned plot and some of the conspirators were pretty deeply
in the mire I guess I wish Id had all the facts about who this
redhaired female Machiavelli waswhat a piece of muckraking it would
have made Oh here comes the rest of the news story over the wire By
Jove it is said on good authority that Bruce will be taken in as one of
the board of directors What do you think of that

So that was how the wind layBruce making love to Mrs Parker and she
presumably betraying her husbands secrets I thought I saw it all
the note from somebody exposing the scheme Parkers incredulity Bruce
sitting by him and catching sight of the note his hurrying out into the
ladies department and then the shot But who fired it After all I
had only picked up another clue

Kennedy was not at the apartment at dinner and an inquiry at the
laboratory was fruitless also So I sat down to fidget for a while
Pretty soon the buzzer on the door sounded and I opened it to find a
messengerboy with a large brown paper parcel

Is Mr Bruce here he asked

Why no he doesnt then I checked myself and added He will be here
presently You can leave the bundle

Well this is the parcel he telephoned for His valet told me to tell
him that they had a hard time to find it but he guesses its all right
The charges are forty cents Sign here

I signed the book feeling like a thief and the boy departed What it
all meant I could not guess

Just then I heard a key in the lock and Kennedy came in

Is your name Bruce I asked

Why he replied eagerly Has anything come

I pointed to the package Kennedy made a dive for it and unwrapped it
It was a womans pongee automobilecoat He held it up to the light The
pocket on the righthand side was scorched and burned and a hole was
torn clean through it I gasped when the full significance of it dawned
on me

How did you get it I exclaimed at last in surprise

Thats where organisation comes in said Kennedy The police at
my request went over every messenger call from Parkers office that
afternoon and traced every one of them up At last they found one that
led to Bruces apartment None of them led to Mrs Parkers home
The rest were all business calls and satisfactorily accounted for I
reasoned that this was the one that involved the disappearance of the
automobilecoat It was a chance worth taking so I got Downey to call
up Bruces valet The valet of course recognised Downeys voice and
suspected nothing Downey assumed to know all about the coat in the
package received yesterday He asked to have it sent up here I see the
scheme worked

But Kennedy do you think she I stopped speechless looking at the
scorched coat

Nothing to sayyet he replied laconically But if you could tell me
anything about that note Parker received Id thank you

I related what our managing editor had said that morning Kennedy only
raised his eyebrows a fraction of an inch

I had guessed something of that sort he said merely Im glad to
find it confirmed even by hearsay evidence This redhaired young lady
interests me Not a very definite description but better than nothing
at all I wonder who she is Ah well what do you say to a stroll down
the White Way before I go to my laboratory Id like a breath of air to
relax my mind

We had got no further than the first theatre when Kennedy slapped me on
the back By George Jameson shes an actress of course

Who is Whats the matter with you Kennedy Are you crazy

The redhaired personshe must be an actress Dont you remember the
auburnhaired leading lady in the Folliesthe girl who sings that
song about Mary Mary quite contrary Her stage name you know is
Phoebe La Neige Well if its she who is concerned in this case I dont
think shell be playing tonight Lets inquire at the boxoffice

She wasnt playing but just what it had to do with anything in
particular I couldnt see and I said as much

Why Walter youd never do as a detective You lack intuition
Sometimes I think I havent quite enough of it either Why didnt I
think of that sooner Dont you know she is the wife of Adolphus Hesse
the most inveterate gambler in stocks in the System Why I had only
to put two and two together and the whole thing flashed on me in an
instant Isnt it a good hypothesis that she is the redhaired woman
in the case the tool of the System in which her husband is so heavily
involved Ill have to add her to my list of suspects

Why you dont think she did the shooting I asked half hoping I
must admit for an assenting nod from him

Well he answered dryly one shouldnt let any preconceived
hypothesis stand between him and the truth Ive made a guess at the
whole thing already It may or it may not be right Anyhow she will fit
into it And if its not right Ive got to be prepared to make a new
guess thats all

When we reached the laboratory on our return the inspectors man Riley
was there waiting impatiently for Kennedy

What luck asked Kennedy

Ive got a list of purchasers of that kind of revolver he said
We have been to every sportinggoods and armsstore in the city which
bought them from the factory and I could lay my hands on pretty nearly
every one of those weapons in twentyfour hoursprovided of course
they havent been secreted or destroyed

Pretty nearly all isnt good enough said Kennedy It will have to be
all unless

That name is in the list whispered Riley hoarsely

Oh then its all right answered Kennedy brightening up Riley I
will say that youre a wonder at using the organisation in ferreting
out such things Theres just one more thing I want you to do I want
a sample of the notepaper in the private desks of every one of these
people He handed the policeman a list of his 9 suspects as he
called them It included nearly every one mentioned in the case

Riley studied it dubiously and scratched his chin thoughtfully Thats
a hard one Mr Kennedy sir You see it means getting into so many
different houses and apartments Now you dont want to do it by means of
a warrant do you sir Of course not Well then how can we get in

Youre a pretty goodlooking chap yourself Riley said Kennedy I
should think you could jolly a housemaid if necessary Anyhow you can
get the fellow on the beat to do itif he isnt already to be found in
the kitchen Why I see a dozen ways of getting the notepaper

Oh its me thats the ladykiller sir grinned Riley Im a regular
Blarney stone when Im out on a job of that sort Sure Ill have some
of them for you in the morning

Bring me what you get the first thing in the morning even if
youve landed only a few samples said Kennedy as Riley departed
straightening his tie and brushing his hat on his sleeve

And now Walter you too must excuse me tonight said Craig Ive
got a lot to do and shant be up to our apartment till very lateor
early But I feel sure Ive got a stranglehold on this mystery If I
get those papers from Riley in good time tomorrow I shall invite you
and several others to a grand demonstration here tomorrow night Dont
forget Keep the whole evening free It will be a big story

Kennedys laboratory was brightly lighted when I arrived early the next
evening One by one his guests dropped in It was evident that they
had little liking for the visit but the coroner had sent out the
invitations and they had nothing to do but accept Each one was
politely welcomed by the professor and assigned a seat much as he would
have done with a group of students The inspector and the coroner sat
back a little Mrs Parker Mr Downey Mr Bruce myself and Miss
La Neige sat in that order in the very narrow and uncomfortable little
armchairs used by the students during lectures

At last Kennedy was ready to begin He took his position behind the
long flattopped table which he used for his demonstrations before his
classes I realise ladies and gentlemen he began formally that I
am about to do a very unusual thing but as you all know the police
and the coroner have been completely baffled by this terrible mystery
and have requested me to attempt to clear up at least certain points in
it I will begin what I have to say by remarking that the tracing out
of a crime like this differs in nothing except as regards the
subjectmatter from the search for a scientific truth The forcing of
mans secrets is like the forcing of natures secrets Both are pieces
of detective work The methods employed in the detection of crime
are or rather should be like the methods employed in the process of
discovering scientific truth In a crime of this sort two kinds of
evidence need to be secured Circumstantial evidence must first be
marshalled and then a motive must be found I have been gathering
facts But to omit motives and rest contented with mere facts would be
inconclusive It would never convince anybody or convict anybody In
other words circumstantial evidence must first lead to a suspect and
then this suspect must prove equal to accounting for the facts It is my
hope that each of you may contribute something that will be of service
in arriving at the truth of this unfortunate incident

The tension was not relieved even when Kennedy stopped speaking and
began to fuss with a little upright target which he set up at one end
of his table We seemed to be seated over a powder magazine which
threatened to explode at any moment I at least felt the tension so
greatly that it was only after he had started speaking again that I
noticed that the target was composed of a thick layer of some puttylike
material

Holding a thirtytwocalibre pistol in his right hand and aiming it at
the target Kennedy picked up a large piece of coarse homespun from the
table and held it loosely over the muzzle of the gun Then he fired The
bullet tore through the cloth sped through the air and buried itself
in the target With a knife he pried it out

I doubt if even the inspector himself could have told us that when an
ordinary leaden bullet is shot through a woven fabric the weave of that
fabric is in the majority of cases impressed on the bullet sometimes
clearly sometimes faintly

Here Kennedy took up a piece of fine batiste and fired another bullet
through it

Every leaden bullet as I have said which has struck such a fabric
bears an impression of the threads which is recognisable even when
the bullet has penetrated deeply into the body It is only obliterated
partially or entirely when the bullet has been flattened by striking a
bone or other hard object Even then as in this case if only a part
of the bullet is flattened the remainder may still show the marks of the
fabric A heavy warp say of cotton velvet or as I have here
homespun will be imprinted well on the bullet but even a fine batiste
containing one hundred threads to the inch will show marks Even layers
of goods such as a coat shirt and undershirt may each leave their
marks but that does not concern us in this case Now I have here a
piece of pongee silk cut from a womans automobilecoat I discharge
the bullet through itso I compare the bullet now with the others and
with the one probed from the neck of Mr Parker I find that the marks
on that fatal bullet correspond precisely with those on the bullet fired
through the pongee coat

Startling as was this revelation Kennedy paused only an instant before
the next

Now I have another demonstration A certain note figures in this case
Mr Parker was reading it or perhaps rereading it at the time he was
shot I have not been able to obtain that noteat least not in a form
such as I could use in discovering what were its contents But in a
certain wastebasket I found a mass of wet and pulplike paper It had
been cut up macerated perhaps chewed perhaps it had been also soaked
with water There was a washbasin with running water in this room The
ink had run and of course was illegible The thing was so unusual that
I at once assumed that this was the remains of the note in question
Under ordinary circumstances it would be utterly valueless as a clue
to anything But today science is not ready to let anything pass as
valueless

I found on microscopic examination that it was an uncommon linen bond
paper and I have taken a large number of microphotographs of the
fibres in it They are all similar I have here also about a hundred
microphotographs of the fibres in other kinds of paper many of them
bonds These I have accumulated from time to time in my study of the
subject None of them as you can see shows fibres resembling this one
in question so we may conclude that it is of uncommon quality Through
an agent of the police I have secured samples of the notepaper of every
one who could be concerned as far as I could see with this case Here
are the photographs of the fibres of these various notepapers and among
them all is just one that corresponds to the fibres in the wet mass of
paper I discovered in the scrapbasket Now lest anyone should question
the accuracy of this method I might cite a case where a man had been
arrested in Germany charged with stealing a government bond He was not
searched till later There was no evidence save that after the arrest a
large number of spitballs were found around the courtyard under his cell
window This method of comparing the fibres with those of the regular
government paper was used and by it the man was convicted of stealing
the bond I think it is almost unnecessary to add that in the present
case we know precisely who

At this point the tension was so great that it snapped Miss La Neige
who was sitting beside me had been leaning forward involuntarily
Almost as if the words were wrung from her she whispered hoarsely They
put me up to doing it I didnt want to But the affair had gone too
far I couldnt see him lost before my very eyes I didnt want her to
get him The quickest way out was to tell the whole story to Mr Parker
and stop it It was the only way I could think of to stop this thing
between another mans wife and the man I loved better than my own
husband God knows Professor Kennedy that was all

Calm yourself madame interrupted Kennedy soothingly Calm yourself
Whats done is done The truth must come out Be calm Now he
continued after the first storm of remorse had spent itself and we were
all outwardly composed again we have said nothing whatever of the most
mysterious feature of the case the firing of the shot The murderer
could have thrust the weapon into the pocket or the folds of this
coathere he drew forth the automobile coat and held it aloft
displaying the bullet holeand he or she I will not say which could
have discharged the pistol unseen By removing and secreting the weapon
afterward one very important piece of evidence would be suppressed
This person could have used such a cartridge as I have here made with
smokeless powder and the coat would have concealed the flash of the
shot very effectively There would have been no smoke But neither this
coat nor even a heavy blanket would have deadened the report of the
shot

What are we to think of that Only one thing I have often wondered
why the thing wasnt done before In fact I have been waiting for it to
occur There is an invention that makes it almost possible to strike
a man down with impunity in broad daylight in any place where there is
sufficient noise to cover up a click a slight Pouf and the whir of
the bullet in the air

I refer to this little device of a Hartford inventor I place it
over the muzzle of the thirtytwocalibre revolver I have so far been
usingso Now Mr Jameson if you will sit at that typewriter over
there and writeanything so long as you keep the keys clicking The
inspector will start that imitation stockticker in the corner Now we
are ready I cover the pistol with a cloth I defy anyone in this room
to tell me the exact moment when I discharged the pistol I could have
shot any of you and an outsider not in the secret would never have
thought that I was the culprit To a certain extent I have reproduced
the conditions under which this shooting occurred

At once on being sure of this feature of the case I despatched a man to
Hartford to see this inventor The man obtained from him a complete list
of all the dealers in New York to whom such devices had been sold The
man also traced every sale of those dealers He did not actually obtain
the weapon but if he is working on scheduletime according to agreement
he is at this moment armed with a searchwarrant and is ransacking
every possible place where the person suspected of this crime could have
concealed his weapon For one of the persons intimately connected with
this case purchased not long ago a silencer for a thirtytwocalibre
revolver and I presume that that person carried the gun and the
silencer at the time of the murder of Kerr Parker

Kennedy concluded in triumph his voice high pitched his eyes flashing
Yet to all outward appearance not a heartbeat was quickened Someone
in that room had an amazing store of selfpossession The fear flitted
across my mind that even at the last Kennedy was baffled

I had anticipated some such anticlimax he continued after a moment
I am prepared for it

He touched a bell and the door to the next room opened One of
Kennedys graduate students stepped in

You have the records Whiting he asked

Yes Professor

I may say said Kennedy that each of your chairs is wired under the
arm in such a way as to betray on an appropriate indicator in the next
room every sudden and undue emotion Though it may be concealed from
the eye even of one like me who stands facing you such emotion is
nevertheless expressed by physical pressure on the arms of the chair It
is a test that is used frequently with students to demonstrate various
points of psychology You neednt raise your arms from the chairs
ladies and gentlemen The tests are all over now What did they show
Whiting

The student read what he had been noting in the next room At the
production of the coat during the demonstration of the markings of
the bullet Mrs Parker had betrayed great emotion Mr Bruce had done
likewise and nothing more than ordinary emotion had been noted for the
rest of us Miss La Neiges automatic record during the tracing out of
the sending of the note to Parker had been especially unfavourable to
her Mr Bruce showed almost as much excitement Mrs Parker very
little and Downey very little It was all set forth in curves drawn by
selfrecording pens on regular ruled paper The student had merely noted
what took place in the lectureroom as corresponding to these curves

At the mention of the noiseless gun said Kennedy bending over the
record while the student pointed it out to him and we leaned forward to
catch his words I find that the curves of Miss La Neige Mrs Parker
and Mr Downey are only so far from normal as would be natural All of
them were witnessing a thing for the first time with only curiosity and
no fear The curve made by Mr Bruce shows great agitation and

I heard a metallic click at my side and turned hastily It was Inspector
Barney OConnor who had stepped out of the shadow with a pair of
handcuffs

James Bruce you are under arrest he said

There flashed on my mind and I think on the minds of some of the
others a picture of another electrically wired chair




II The Scientific Cracksman

Im willing to wager you a box of cigars that you dont know the most
fascinating story in your own paper tonight remarked Kennedy as I
came in one evening with the four or five newspapers I was in the habit
of reading to see whether they had beaten the Star in getting any news
of importance

Ill bet I do I said or I was one of about a dozen who worked it
up Its the Shaw murder trial There isnt another thats even a bad
second

I am afraid the cigars will be on you Walter Crowded over on the
second page by a lot of stale sensation that everyone has read for the
fiftieth time now you will find what promises to be a real sensation
a curious halfcolumn account of the sudden death of John G Fletcher

I laughed Craig I said when you put up a simple death from
apoplexy against a murder trial and such a murder trial well you
disappoint methats all

Is it a simple case of apoplexy he asked pacing up and down the
room while I wondered why he should grow excited over what seemed a
very ordinary news item after all Then he picked up the paper and read
the account slowly aloud


 JOHN G FLETCHER STEEL MAGNATE DIES SUDDENLY

 SAFE OPEN BUT LARGE SUM OF CASH UNTOUCHED

John Graham Fletcher the aged philanthropist and steelmaker was found
dead in his library this morning at his home at Fletcherwood Great
Neck Long Island Strangely the safe in the library in which he kept
his papers and a large sum of cash was found opened but as far as could
be learned nothing is missing

It had always been Mr Fletchers custom to rise at seven oclock This
morning his housekeeper became alarmed when he had not appeared by nine
oclock Listening at the door she heard no sound It was not locked
and on entering she found the former steelmagnate lying lifeless on
the floor between his bedroom and the library adjoining His personal
physician Dr W C Bryant was immediately notified

Close examination of the body revealed that his face was slightly
discoloured and the cause of death was given by the physician as
apoplexy He had evidently been dead about eight or nine hours when
discovered

Mr Fletcher is survived by a nephew John G Fletcher II who is the
Blake professor of bacteriology at the University and by a grandniece
Miss Helen Bond Professor Fletcher was informed of the sad occurrence
shortly after leaving a class this morning and hurried out to
Fletcherwood He would make no statement other than that he was
inexpressibly shocked Miss Bond who has for several years resided with
relatives Mr and Mrs Francis Greene of Little Neck is prostrated by
the shock

Walter added Kennedy as he laid down the paper and without any more
sparring came directly to the point there was something missing from
that safe

I had no need to express the interest I now really felt and Kennedy
hastened to take advantage of it

Just before you came in he continued Jack Fletcher called me up
from Great Neck You probably dont know it but it has been privately
reported in the inner circle of the University that old Fletcher was
to leave the bulk of his fortune to found a great school of preventive
medicine and that the only proviso was that his nephew should be dean
of the school The professor told me over the wire that the will was
missing from the safe and that it was the only thing missing From his
excitement I judge that there is more to the story than he cared to
tell over the phone He said his car was on the way to the city and he
asked if I wouldnt come and help himhe wouldnt say how Now I know
him pretty well and Im going to ask you to come along Walter for
the express purpose of keeping this thing out of the newspapers
understanduntil we get to the bottom of it

A few minutes later the telephone rang and the hallboy announced that
the car was waiting We hurried down to it the chauffeur lounged down
carelessly into his seat and we were off across the city and river and
out on the road to Great Neck with amazing speed

Already I began to feel something of Kennedys zest for the adventure
I found myself half a dozen times on the point of hazarding a suspicion
only to relapse again into silence at the inscrutable look on Kennedys
face What was the mystery that awaited us in the great lonely house on
Long Island

We found Fletcherwood a splendid estate directly on the bay with a long
driveway leading up to the door Professor Fletcher met us at the porte
cochere and I was glad to note that far from taking me as an intruder
he seemed rather relieved that someone who understood the ways of the
newspapers could stand between him and any reporters who might possibly
drop in

He ushered us directly into the library and closed the door It seemed
as if he could scarcely wait to tell his story

Kennedy he began almost trembling with excitement look at that
safe door

We looked It had been drilled through in such a way as to break the
combination It was a heavy door closely fitting and it was the best
kind of small safe that the state of the art had produced Yet clearly
it had been tampered with and successfully Who was this scientific
cracksman who had apparently accomplished the impossible It was no
ordinary hand and brain which had executed this job

Fletcher swung the door wide and pointed to a little compartment
inside whose steel door had been jimmied open Then out of it he
carefully lifted a steel box and deposited it on the library table

I suppose everybody has been handling that box asked Craig quickly

A smile flitted across Fletchers features I thought of that
Kennedy he said I remembered what you once told me about
fingerprints Only myself has touched it and I was careful to take
hold of it only on the sides The will was placed in this box and the
key to the box was usually in the lock Well the will is gone Thats
all nothing else was touched But for the life of me I cant find a
mark on the box not a fingermark Now on a hot and humid summer night
like last night I should say it was pretty likely that anyone touching
this metal box would have left fingermarks Shouldnt you think so
Kennedy

Kennedy nodded and continued to examine the place where the compartment
had been jimmied A low whistle aroused us coming over to the table
Craig tore a white sheet of paper off a pad lying there and deposited a
couple of small particles on it

I found them sticking on the jagged edges of the steel where it had
been forced he said Then he whipped out a pocket magnifyingglass
Not from a rubber glove he commented half to himself By Jove
one side of them shows lines that look as if they were the lines on a
persons fingers and the other side is perfectly smooth Theres not a
chance of using them as a clue exceptwell I didnt know criminals in
America knew that stunt

What stunt

Why you know how keen the new detectives are on the fingerprint
system Well the first thing some of the uptodate criminals in Europe
did was to wear rubber gloves so that they would leave no prints But
you cant work very well with rubber gloves Last fall in Paris I heard
of a fellow who had given the police a lot of trouble He never left a
mark or at least it was no good if he did He painted his hands lightly
with a liquid rubber which he had invented himself It did all that
rubber gloves would do and yet left him the free use of his fingers with
practically the same keenness of touch Fletcher whatever is at the
bottom of this affair I feel sure right now that you have to deal with
no ordinary criminal

Do you suppose there are any relatives besides those we know of I
asked Kennedy when Fletcher had left to summon the servants

No he replied I think not Fletcher and Helen Bond his second
cousin to whom he is engaged are the only two

Kennedy continued to study the library He walked in and out of the
doors and examined the windows and viewed the safe from all angles

The old gentlemans bedroom is here he said indicating a door Now
a good smart noise or perhaps even a light shining through the transom
from the library might arouse him Suppose he woke up suddenly and
entered by this door He would see the thief at work on the safe
Yes that part of reconstructing the story is simple But who was the
intruder

Just then Fletcher returned with the servants The questioning was long
and tedious and developed nothing except that the butler admitted that
he was uncertain whether the windows in the library were locked The
gardener was very obtuse but finally contributed one possibly important
fact He had noted in the morning that the back gate leading into a
disused road closer to the bay than the main highway in front of the
house was open It was rarely used and was kept closed only by an
ordinary hook Whoever had opened it had evidently forgotten to hook it
He had thought it strange that it was unhooked and in closing it he had
noticed in the mud of the roadway marks that seemed to indicate that an
automobile had stood there

After the servants had gone Fletcher asked us to excuse him for a
while as he wished to run over to the Greenes who lived across the
bay Miss Bond was completely prostrated by the death of her uncle he
said and was in an extremely nervous condition Meanwhile if we found
any need of a machine we might use his uncles or in fact anything
around the place

Walter said Craig when Fletcher had gone I want to run back to
town tonight and I have something Id like to have you do too

We were soon speeding back along the splendid road to Long Island City
while he laid out our programme

You go down to the Star office he said and look through all the
clippings on the whole Fletcher family Get a complete story of the life
of Helen Bond toowhat she has done in society with whom she has been
seen mostly whether she has made any trips abroad and whether she
has ever been engagedyou know anything likely to be significant Im
going up to the apartment to get my camera and then to the laboratory to
get some rather bulky paraphernalia I want to take out to Fletcherwood
Meet me at the Columbus Circle station at say halfpastten

So we separated My search revealed the fact that Miss Bond had always
been intimate with the ultrafashionable set had spent last summer
in Europe a good part of the time in Switzerland and Paris with the
Greenes As far as I could find out she had never been reported engaged
but plenty of fortunes as well as foreign titles had been flitting about
the ward of the steelmagnate

Craig and I met at the appointed time He had a lot of paraphernalia
with him and it did not add to our comfort as we sped back but it
wasnt much over half an hour before we again found ourselves nearing
Great Neck

Instead of going directly back to Fletcherwood however Craig had told
the chauffeur to stop at the plant of the local electric light and power
company where he asked if he might see the record of the amount of
current used the night before

The curve sprawled across the ruled surface of the sheet by the
automatic registeringneedle was irregular showing the ups and downs of
the current rising sharply from sundown and gradually declining after
nine oclock as the lights went out Somewhere between eleven and
twelve oclock however the irregular fall of the curve was broken by a
quite noticeable upward twist

Craig asked the men if that usually happened They were quite sure that
the curve as a rule went gradually down until twelve oclock when the
power was shut off But they did not see anything remarkable in it Oh
I suppose some of the big houses had guests volunteered the foreman
and just to show off the place perhaps they turned on all the lights
I dont know sir what it was but it couldnt have been a heavy drain
or we would have noticed it at the time and the lights would all have
been dim

Well said Craig just watch and see if it occurs again tonight
about the same time

All right sir

And when you close down the plant for the night will you bring the
record card up to Fletcherwood asked Craig slipping a bill into the
pocket of the foremans shirt

I will and thank you sir

It was nearly halfpast eleven when Craig had got his apparatus set up
in the library at Fletcherwood Then he unscrewed all the bulbs from the
chandelier in the library and attached in their places connections with
the usual green silkcovered flexible wire rope These were then joined
up to a little instrument which to me looked like a drill Next he
muffed the drill with a wad of felt and applied it to the safe door

I could hear the dull tattat of the drill Going into the bedroom and
closing the door I found that it was still audible to me but an old
man inclined to deafness and asleep would scarcely have been awakened
by it In about ten minutes Craig displayed a neat little hole in the
safe door opposite the one made by the cracksman in the combination

Im glad youre honest I said or else we might be afraid of
youperhaps even make you prove an alibi for last nights job

He ignored my bantering and said in a tone such as he might have
used before a class of students in the gentle art of scientific
safecracking Now if the power companys curve is just the same
tonight as last night that will show how the thing was done I wanted
to be sure of it so I thought Id try this apparatus which I smuggled
in from Paris last year I believe the old man happened to be wakeful
and heard it

Then he pried off the door of the interior compartment which had been
jimmied open Perhaps we may learn something by looking at this
door and studying the marks left by the jimmy by means of this new
instrument of mine he said

On the library table he fastened an arrangement with two upright posts
supporting a dial which he called a dynamometer The uprights were
braced in the back and the whole thing reminded me of a miniature
guillotine

This is my mechanical detective said Craig proudly It was devised
by Bertillon himself and he personally gave me permission to copy his
own machine You see it is devised to measure pressure Now lets take
an ordinary jimmy and see just how much pressure it takes to duplicate
those marks on this door

Craig laid the piece of steel on the dynamometer in the position it had
occupied in the safe and braced it tightly Then he took a jimmy and
pressed on it with all his strength The steel door was connected with
the indicator and the needle spun around until it indicated a pressure
such as only a strong man could have exerted Comparing the marks made
in the steel in the experiment and by the safecracker it was evident
that no such pressure had been necessary Apparently the lock on the
door was only a trifling affair and the steel itself was not very
tough The safemakers had relied on the first line of defence to repel
attack

Craig tried again and again each time using less force At last he got
a mark just about similar to the original marks on the steel

Well well what do you think of that he exclaimed reflectively A
child could have done that part of the job

Just then the lights went off for the night Craig lighted the oillamp
and sat in silence until the electric light plant foreman appeared with
the cardrecord which showed a curve practically identical with that of
the night before

A few moments later Professor Fletchers machine came up the driveway
and he joined us with a worried and preoccupied look on his face that
he could not conceal Shes terribly broken up by the suddenness of it
all he murmured as he sank into an armchair The shock has been too
much for her In fact I hadnt the heart to tell her anything about
the robbery poor girl Then in a moment he asked Any more clues yet
Kennedy

Well nothing of first importance I have only been trying to
reconstruct the story of the robbery so that I can reason out a motive
and a few details then when the real clues come along we wont have
so much ground to cover The cracksman was certainly clever He used an
electric drill to break the combination and ran it by the electric light
current

Whew exclaimed the professor is that so He must have been above
the average Thats interesting

By the way Fletcher said Kennedy I wish you would introduce me to
your fiancee tomorrow I would like to know her

Gladly Fletcher replied only you must be careful what you talk
about Remember the death of uncle has been quite a shock to herhe
was her only relative besides myself

I will promised Kennedy and by the way she may think it strange
that Im out here at a time like this Perhaps you had better tell
her Im a nerve specialist or something of that sortanything not to
connect me with the robbery which you say you havent told her about

The next morning found Kennedy out bright and early for he had not had
a very good chance to do anything during the night except reconstruct
the details He was now down by the back gate with his camera where I
found him turning it enddown and photographing the road Together we
made a thorough search of the woods and the road about the gate but
could discover absolutely nothing

After breakfast I improvised a dark room and developed the films while
Craig went down the back lane along the shore looking for clues as he
said briefly Toward noon he returned and I could see that he was in
a brown study So I said nothing but handed him the photographs of
the road He took them and laid them down in a long line on the library
floor They seemed to consist of little ridges of dirt on either side
of a series of regular round spots some of the spots very clear and
distinct on the sides others quite obscure in the centre Now and then
where you would expect to see one of the spots just for the symmetry of
the thing it was missing As I looked at the line of photographs on the
floor I saw that they were a photograph of the track made by the tire of
an automobile and I suddenly recalled what the gardener had said

Next Craig produced the results of his mornings work which consisted
of several dozen sheets of white paper carefully separated into three
bundles These he also laid down in long lines on the floor each
package in a separate line Then I began to realise what he was doing
and became fascinated in watching him on his hands and knees eagerly
scanning the papers and comparing them with the photographs At last
he gathered up two of the sets of papers very decisively and threw them
away Then he shifted the third set a bit and laid it closely parallel
to the photographs

Look at these Walter he said Now take this deep and sharp
indentation Well theres a corresponding one in the photograph So you
can pick them out one for another Now heres one missing altogether on
the paper So it is in the photograph

Almost like a schoolboy in his glee he was comparing the little round
circles made by the metal insertions in an antiskid automobile tire
Time and again I had seen imprints like that left in the dust and grease
of an asphalted street or the mud of a road It had never occurred to me
that they might be used in any way Yet here Craig was calmly tracing
out the similarity before my very eyes identifying the marks made in
the photograph with the prints left on the bits of paper

As I followed him I had a most curious feeling of admiration for his
genius Craig I cried thats the thumbprint of an automobile

There speaks the yellow journalist he answered merrily Thumb Print
System Applied to Motor CarsI can see the Sunday feature story
you have in your mind with that headline already Yes Walter thats
precisely what this is The Berlin police have used it a number of times
with the most startling results

But Craig I exclaimed suddenly the paper prints where did you get
them What machine is it

Its one not very far from here he answered sententiously and I saw
he would say nothing more that might fix a false suspicion on anyone
Still my curiosity was so great that if there had been an opportunity I
certainly should have tried out his plan on all the cars in the Fletcher
garage

Kennedy would say nothing more and we ate our luncheon in silence
Fletcher who had decided to lunch with the Greenes called Kennedy up
on the telephone to tell him it would be all right for him to call on
Miss Bond later in the afternoon

And I may bring over the apparatus I once described to you to determine
just what her nervous condition is he asked Apparently the answer was
yes for Kennedy hung up the receiver with a satisfied Goodbye

Walter I want you to come along with me this afternoon as my
assistant Remember Im now Dr Kennedy the nerve specialist and you
are Dr Jameson my colleague and we are to be in consultation on a
most important case

Do you think thats fair I asked hotly to take that girl off her
guard to insinuate yourself into her confidence as a medical adviser
and worm out of her some kind of fact incriminating someone I suppose
thats your plan and I dont like the ethics or rather the lack of
ethics of the thing

Now think a minute Walter Perhaps I am wrong I dont know Certainly
I feel that the end will justify the means I have an idea that I
can get from Miss Bond the only clue that I need one that will lead
straight to the criminal Who knows I have a suspicion that the thing
Im going to do is the highest form of your socalled ethics If what
Fletcher tells us is true that girl is going insane over this thing
Why should she be so shocked over the death of an uncle she did not
live with I tell you she knows something about this case that it is
necessary for us to know too If she doesnt tell someone it will eat
her mind out Ill add a dinner to the box of cigars we have already bet
on this case that what Im going to do is for the bestfor her best

Again I yielded for I was coming to have more and more faith in the old
Kennedy I had seen made over into a firstclass detective and together
we started for the Greenes Craig carrying something in one of those
long black handbags which physicians use

Fletcher met us on the driveway He seemed to be very much affected
for his face was drawn and he shifted from one position to another
nervously from which we inferred that Miss Bond was feeling worse It
was late afternoon almost verging on twilight as he led us through
the receptionhall and thence onto a long porch overlooking the bay and
redolent with honeysuckle

Miss Bond was half reclining in a wicker chair us we entered She
started to rise to greet us but Fletcher gently restrained her saying
as he introduced us that he guessed the doctors would pardon any
informality from an invalid

Fletcher was a pretty fine fellow and I had come to like him but I
soon found myself wondering what he had ever done to deserve winning
such a girl as Helen Bond She was what I should describe as the ideal
type of new womantall and athletic yet without any affectation
of mannishness The very first thought that struck me was the
incongruousness of a girl of her type suffering from an attack of
nerves and I felt sure it must be as Craig had said that she was
concealing a secret that was having a terrible effect on her A casual
glance might not have betrayed the true state of her feelings for her
dark hair and large brown eyes and the tan of many suns on her face and
arms betokened anything but the neurasthenic One felt instinctively
that she was with all her athletic grace primarily a womanly woman

The sun sinking toward the hills across the bay softened the brown of
her skin and as I observed by watching her closely served partially
to conceal the nervousness which was wholly unnatural in a girl of such
poise When she smiled there was a false note in it it was forced and
it was sufficiently evident to me that she was going through a mental
hell of conflicting emotions that would have killed a woman of less
selfcontrol

I felt that I would like to be in Fletchers shoesdoubly so when at
Kennedys request he withdrew leaving me to witness the torture of a
woman of such fine sensibilities already hunted remorselessly by her
own thoughts

Still I will give Kennedy credit for a tactfulness that I didnt know
the old fellow possessed He carried through the preliminary questions
very well for a pseudodoctor appealing to me as his assistant on
inconsequential things that enabled me to save my face perfectly When
he came to the critical moment of opening the black bag he made a very
appropriate and easy remark about not having brought any sharp shiny
instruments or nasty black drugs

All I wish to do Miss Bond is to make a few simple little tests of
your nervous condition One of them we specialists call reaction time
and another is a test of heart action Neither is of any seriousness at
all so I beg of you not to become excited for the chief value consists
in having the patient perfectly quiet and normal After they are over
I think Ill know whether to prescribe absolute rest or a visit to
Newport

She smiled languidly as he adjusted a long tightly fitting rubber
glove on her shapely forearm and then encased it in a larger absolutely
inflexible covering of leather Between the rubber glove and the leather
covering was a liquid communicating by a glass tube with a sort of
dial Craig had often explained to me how the pressure of the blood was
registered most minutely on the dial showing the varied emotions as
keenly as if you had taken a peep into the very mind of the subject
I think the experimental psychologists called the thing a
plethysmograph

Then he had an apparatus which measured association time The essential
part of this instrument was the operation of a very delicate stopwatch
and this duty was given to me It was nothing more nor less than
measuring the time that elapsed between his questions to her and her
answers while he recorded the actual questions and answers and noted
the results which I worked out Neither of us was unfamiliar with the
process for when we were in college these instruments were just coming
into use in America Kennedy had never let his particular branch of
science narrow him but had made a practice of keeping abreast of all
the important discoveries and methods in other fields Besides I
had read articles about the chronoscope the plethysmograph the
sphygmograph and others of the new psychological instruments Craig
carried it off however as if he did that sort of thing as an everyday
employment

Now Miss Bond he said and his voice was so reassuring and
persuasive that I could see she was not made even a shade more nervous
by our simple preparations the gameit is just like a childrens
parlour gameis just this I will say a wordtake dog for instance
You are to answer back immediately the first word that comes into your
mind suggested by itsay cat I will say chain for example and
probably you will answer collar and so on Do you catch my meaning
It may seem ridiculous no doubt but before we are through I feel sure
youll see how valuable such a test is particularly in a simple case of
nervousness such as yours

I dont think she found any sinister interpretation in his words but I
did and if ever I wanted to protest it was then but my voice seemed to
stick in my throat

He was beginning It was clearly up to me to give in and not interfere
As closely as I was able I kept my eyes riveted on the watch and other
apparatus while my ears and heart followed with mingled emotions the
low musical voice of the girl

I will not give all the test for there was much of it particularly at
the start that was in reality valueless since it was merely leading up
to the surprise tests From the colourless questions Kennedy suddenly
changed It was done in an instant when Miss Bond had been completely
disarmed and put off her guard

Night said Kennedy Day came back the reply from Miss Bond

Automobile Horse

Bay Beach

Road Forest

Gate Fence

Path Shrubs

Porch House

Did I detect or imagine a faint hesitation

Window Curtain

Yes it was plain that time But the words followed one another in quick
succession There was no rest She had no chance to collect herself I
noted the marked difference in the reaction time and in my sympathy
damned this cold scientific third degree

Paris France

Quartier Latin Students

Apaches Craig gave it its Gallicised pronunciation Apash
Really Dr Kennedy she said there is nothing I can associate
with themwell yes les vaches I believe You had better count that
question out Ive wasted a good many seconds

Very well let us try again he replied with a forced unconcern
though the answer seemed to interest him for les vaches meant the
cows otherwise known as the police

No lawyer could have revelled in an opportunity for putting leading
questions more ruthlessly than did Kennedy He snapped out his words
sharply and unexpectedly

Chandelier Light

Electric light he emphasised Broadway she answered endeavouring
to force a new association of ideas to replace one which she strove to
conceal

Safe Vaults Out of the corner of my eye I could see that the
indicator showed a tremendously increased heart action As for the
reaction time I noted that it was growing longer and more significant
Remorselessly he pressed his words home Mentally I cursed him

Rubber Tire

Steel Pittsburg she cried at random

Strongbox No answer

Lock Again no answer He hurried his words I was leaning forward
tense with excitement and sympathy

Key Silence and a fluttering of the blood pressure indicator

Will

As the last word was uttered her air of frightened defiance was swept
away With a cry of anguish she swayed to her feet No no doctor
you must not you must not she cried with outstretched arms Why do
you pick out those words of all others Can it be If I had not caught
her I believe she would have fainted

The indicator showed a heart alternately throbbing with feverish
excitement and almost stopping with fear What would Kennedy do next I
wondered determined to shut him off as soon as I possibly could From
the moment I had seen her I had been under her spell Mine should have
been Fletchers place I knew though I cannot but say that I felt a
certain grim pleasure in supporting even momentarily such a woman in her
time of need

Can it be that you have guessed what no one in the world no not even
dear old Jack dreams Oh I shall go mad mad mad

Kennedy was on his feet in an instant advancing toward her The look in
his eyes was answer enough for her She knew that he knew and she paled
and shuddered shrinking away from him

Miss Bond he said in a voice that forced attentionit was low and
vibrating with feelingMiss Bond have you ever told a lie to shield a
friend

Yes she said her eyes meeting his

So can I came back the same tense voice when I know the truth about
that friend

Then for the first time tears came in a storm Her breath was quick and
feverish No one will ever believe no one will understand They will
say that I killed him that I murdered him

Through it all I stood almost speechless puzzled What did it all mean

No said Kennedy no for they will never know of it

Never know

Neverif in the end justice is done Have you the will Or did you
destroy it

It was a bold stroke

Yes No Here it is How could I destroy it even though it was burning
out my very soul

She literally tore the paper from the bosom of her dress and cast it
from her in horror and terror

Kennedy picked it up opened it and glanced hurriedly through it Miss
Bond he said Jack shall never know a word of this I shall tell him
that the will has been found unexpectedly in John Fletchers desk among
some other papers Walter swear on your honour as a gentleman that this
will was found in old Fletchers desk

Dr Kennedy how can I ever thank you she exclaimed sinking wearily
down into a chair and pressing her hands to her throbbing forehead

By telling me just how you came by this will so that when you and
Fletcher are married I may be as good a friend without suspicion to
you as I am to him I think a full confession would do you good Miss
Bond Would you prefer to have Dr Jameson not hear it

No he may stay

This much I know Miss Bond Last summer in Paris with the Greenes you
must have chanced to hear of Pillard the Apache one of the most noted
cracksmen the world has ever produced You sought him out He taught
you how to paint your fingers with a rubber composition how to use an
electric drill how to use the oldfashioned jimmy You went down to
Fletcherwood by the back road about a quarter after eleven the night of
the robbery in the Greenes little electric runabout You entered the
library by an unlocked window you coupled your drill to the electric
light connections of the chandelier You had to work quickly for the
power would go off at midnight yet you could not do the job later when
they were sleeping more soundly for the very same reason

It was uncanny as Kennedy rushed along in his reconstruction of the
scene almost unbelievable The girl watched him fascinated

John Fletcher was wakeful that night Somehow or other he heard you
at work He entered the library and by the light streaming from his
bedroom he saw who it was In anger he must have addressed you and his
passion got the better of his agehe fell suddenly on the floor with a
stroke of apoplexy As you bent over him he died But why did you ever
attempt so foolish an undertaking Didnt you know that other people
knew of the will and its terms that you were sure to be traced out
in the end if not by friends by foes How did you suppose you could
profit by destroying the will of which others knew the provisions

Any other woman than Helen Bond would have been hysterical long before
Kennedy had finished pressing home remorselessly one fact after another
of her story But with her the relief now after the tension of many
hours of concealment seemed to nerve her to go to the end and tell the
truth

What was it Had she some secret lover for whom she had dared all to
secure the family fortune Or was she shielding someone dearer to her
than her own reputation Why had Kennedy made Fletcher withdraw

Her eyes dropped and her breast rose and fell with suppressed emotion
Yet I was hardly prepared for her reply when at last she slowly raised
her head and looked us calmly in the face

I did it because I loved Jack

Neither of us spoke I at least had fallen completely under the spell
of this masterful woman Right or wrong I could not restrain a feeling
of admiration and amazement

Yes she said as her voice thrilled with emotion strange as it may
sound to you it was not love of self that made me do it I was I am
madly in love with Jack No other man has ever inspired such respect and
love as he has His work in the university I have fairly gloated over
And yetand yet Dr Kennedy can you not see that I am different from
Jack What would I do with the income of the wife of even the dean of
the new school The annuity provided for me in that will is paltry I
need millions From the tiniest baby I have been reared that way I have
always expected this fortune I have been given everything I wanted
But it is different when one is marriedyou must have your own money I
need a fortune for then I could have the town house the country house
the yacht the motors the clothes the servants that I needthey are
as much a part of my life as your profession is of yours I must have
them

And now it was all to slip from my hands True it was to go in such a
way by this last will as to make Jack happy in his new school I could
have let that go if that was all There are other fortunes that have
been laid at my feet But I wanted Jack and I knew Jack wanted me Dear
boy he never could realise how utterly unhappy intellectual poverty
would have made me and how my unhappiness would have reacted on him in
the end In reality this great and beneficent philanthropy was finally
to blight both our love and our lives

What was I to do Stand by and see my life and my love ruined or refuse
Jack for the fortune of a man I did not love Helen Bond is not that
kind of a woman I said to myself I consulted the greatest lawyer I
knew I put a hypothetical case to him and asked his opinion in such a
way as to make him believe he was advising me how to make an unbreakable
will He told me of provisions and clauses to avoid particularly in
making benefactions That was what I wanted to know I would put one of
those clauses in my uncles will I practised uncles writing till I
was as good a forger of that clause as anyone could have become I had
picked out the very words in his own handwriting to practise from

Then I went to Paris and as you have guessed learned how to get
things out of a safe like that of uncles Before God all I planned
to do was to get that will change it replace it and trust that uncle
would never notice the change Then when he was gone I would have
contested the will I would have got my full share either by court
proceedings or by settlement out of court You see I had planned it all
out The school would have been foundedI we would have founded it
What difference I said did thirty millions or fifty millions make to
an impersonal school a school not yet even in existence The twenty
million dollars or so difference or even half of it meant life and
love to me

I had planned to steal the cash in the safe anything to divert
attention from the will and make it look like a plain robbery I would
have done the altering of the will that night and have returned it to
the safe before morning But it was not to be I had almost opened the
safe when my uncle entered the room His anger completely unnerved me
and from the moment I saw him on the floor to this I havent had a sane
thought I forgot to take the cash I forgot everything but that will
My only thought was that I must get it and destroy it I doubt if I
could have altered it with my nerves so upset There now you have my
whole story I am at your mercy

No said Kennedy believe me there is a mental statute of
limitations that as far as Jameson and myself are concerned has already
erased this affair Walter will you find Fletcher

I found the professor pacing up and down the gravel walk impatiently

Fletcher said Kennedy a nights rest is all Miss Bond really needs
It is simply a case of overwrought nerves and it will pass off of
itself Still I would advise a change of scene as soon as possible
Good afternoon Miss Bond and my best wishes for your health

Good afternoon Dr Kennedy Good afternoon Dr Jameson

I for one was glad to make my escape

A halfhour later Kennedy with wellsimulated excitement was racing
me in the car up to the Greenes again We literally burst unannounced
into the teteatete on the porch

Fletcher Fletcher cried Kennedy look what Walter and I have just
discovered in a tin strongbox poked off in the back of your uncles
desk

Fletcher seized the will and by the dim light that shone through from
the hall read it hastily Thank God he cried the school is provided
for as I thought

Isnt it glorious murmured Helen

True to my instinct I muttered Another good newspaper yarn killed




III The Bacteriological Detective

Kennedy was deeply immersed in writing a lecture on the chemical
compositions of various bacterial toxins and antitoxins a thing which
was as unfamiliar to me as Kamchatka but as familiar to Kennedy as
Broadway and Fortysecond Street

Really he remarked laying down his fountainpen and lighting his
cigar for the hundredth time the more one thinks of how the modern
criminal misses his opportunities the more astonishing it seems Why do
they stick to pistols chloroform and prussic acid when there is such a
splendid assortment of refined methods they might employ

Give it up old man I replied helplessly unless it is because they
havent any imagination I hope they dont use them What would become
of my business if they did How would you ever get a really dramatic
news feature for the Star out of such a thing Dotted line marks route
taken by fatal germ cross indicates spot where antitoxin attacked
itha ha not much for the yellow journals in that Craig

To my mind Walter it would be the height of the dramaticfar more
dramatic than sending a bullet into a man Any fool can shoot a pistol
or cut a throat but it takes brains to be uptodate

It may be so I admitted and went on reading while Kennedy scratched
away diligently on his lecture I mention this conversation both because
it bears on my story by a rather peculiar coincidence and because it
showed me a new side of Kennedys amazing researches He was as
much interested in bacteria as in chemistry and the story is one of
bacteria

It was perhaps a quarter of an hour later when the buzzer on our hall
door sounded Imagine my surprise on opening the door to discover the
slight figure of what appeared to be a most fascinating young lady who
was heavily veiled She was in a state almost bordering on hysteria as
even I in spite of my usual obtuseness noticed

Is Professor Kennedy in she inquired anxiously

Yes maam I replied opening the door into our study

She advanced toward him repeating her inquiry

I am Professor Kennedy Pray be seated he said

The presence of a lady in our apartment was such a novelty that really
I forgot to disappear but busied myself straightening the furniture and
opening a window to allow the odour of stale tobacco to escape

My name is Eveline Bisbee she began I have heard Professor
Kennedy that you are an adept at getting at the bottom of difficult
mysteries

You flatter me he said in acknowledgment Who was so foolish as to
tell you that

A friend who has heard of the Kerr Parker case she replied

I beg your pardon I interrupted I didnt mean to intrude I think
Ill go out Ill be back in an hour or two

Please Mr Jamesonit is Mr Jameson is it not

I bowed in surprise

If it is possible I wish you would stay and hear my story I am told
that you and Professor Kennedy always work together

It was my turn to be embarrassed by the compliment

Mrs Fletcher of Great Neck she explained has told me I believe
Professor Kennedy performed a great service for the Fletchers though I
do not know what it was At any rate I have come to you with my case
in which I have small hope of obtaining assistance unless you can help
me If Professor Kennedy cannot solve it well Im afraid nobody can
She paused a moment then added No doubt you have read of the death of
my guardian the other day

Of course we had Who did not know that Jim Bisbee the southern
California oilmagnate had died suddenly of typhoid fever at the
private hospital of Dr Bell where he had been taken from his
magnificent apartment on Riverside Drive Kennedy and I had discussed
it at the time We had commented on the artificiality of the twentieth
century No longer did people have homes they had apartments I had
said They didnt fall ill in the good oldfashioned way any more
either in fact they even hired special rooms to die in They hired
halls for funeral services It was a wonder that they didnt hire
graves It was all part of our twentieth century breakup of tradition
Indeed we did know about the death of Jim Bisbee But there was nothing
mysterious about it It was just typical in all its surroundings of the
first decade of the twentieth century in a great artificial citya
lonely death of a great man surrounded by all that money could buy

We had read of his ward too the beautiful Miss Eveline Bisbee a
distant relation As under the heat of the room and her excitement she
raised her veil we were very much interested in her At least I am
sure that even Kennedy had by this time completely forgotten the lecture
on toxins

There is something about my guardians death she began in a low and
tremulous voice that I am sure will bear investigating It may be only
a womans foolish fears butI havent told this to a soul till now
except Mrs Fletcher My guardian had as you perhaps know spent his
summer at his country place at Bisbee Hall New Jersey from which he
returned rather suddenly about a week ago Our friends thought it merely
a strange whim that he should return to the city before the summer was
fairly over but it was not The day before he returned his gardener
fell sick of typhoid That decided Mr Bisbee to return to the city on
the following day Imagine his consternation to find his valet stricken
the very next morning Of course they motored to New York immediately
then he wired to me at Newport and together we opened his apartment at
the Louis Quinze

But that was not to be the end of it One after another the servants
at Bisbee Hall were taken with the disease until five of them were down
Then came the last blowMr Bisbee fell a victim in New York So far
I have been spared But who knows how much longer it will last I have
been so frightened that I havent eaten a meal in the apartment since I
came back When I am hungry I simply steal out to a hotela different
one every time I never drink any water except that which I have
surreptitiously boiled in my own room over a gasstove Disinfectants
and germicides have been used by the gallon and still I dont feel
safe Even the health authorities dont remove my fears With my
guardians death I had begun to feel that possibly it was over But no
This morning another servant who came up from the hall last week was
taken sick and the doctor pronounces that typhoid too Will I be the
next Is it just a foolish fear Why does it pursue us to New York Why
didnt it stop at Bisbee Hall

I dont think I ever saw a living creature more overcome by horror by
an invisible deadly fear That was why it was doubly horrible in a girl
so attractive as Eveline Bisbee As I listened I felt how terrible it
must be to be pursued by such a fear What must it be to be dogged by
a disease as relentlessly as the typhoid had dogged her If it had been
some great but visible tangible peril how gladly I could have faced it
merely for the smile of a woman like this But it was a peril that
only knowledge and patience could meet Instinctively I turned toward
Kennedy my own mind being an absolute blank

Is there anyone you suspect of being the cause of such an epidemic he
asked I may as well tell you right now that I have already formed
two theoriesone perfectly natural the other diabolical Tell me
everything

Well I had expected to receive a fortune of one million dollars free
and clear by his will and this morning I am informed by his lawyer
James Denny that a new will had been made It is still one million But
the remainder instead of going to a number of charities in which he was
known to be interested goes to form a trust fund for the Bisbee School
of Mechanical Arts of which Mr Denny is the sole trustee Of course
I do not know much about my guardians interests while he was alive but
it strikes me as strange that he should have changed so radically and
besides the new will is so worded that if I die without children
my million also goes to this schoollocation unnamed I cant help
wondering about it all

Why should you wonderat least what other reasons have you for
wondering

Oh I cant express them Maybe after all its only a womans silly
intuition But often I have thought in the past few days about this
illness of my guardian It was so queer He was always so careful And
you know the rich dont often have typhoid

You have no reason to suppose that it was not typhoid fever of which he
died

She hesitated No she replied but if you had known Mr Bisbee
you would think it strange too He had a horror of infectious and
contagious diseases His apartment and his country home were models No
sanitarium could have been more punctilious He lived what one of his
friends called an antiseptic life Maybe I am foolish but it keeps
getting closer and closer to me now andwell I wish youd look into
the case Please set my mind at rest and assure me that nothing is
wrong that it is all natural

I will help you Miss Bisbee Tomorrow night I want to take a trip
quietly to Bisbee Hall You will see that it is all right that I have
the proper letters so I can investigate thoroughly

I shall never forget the mute and eloquent thanks with which she said
good night after Kennedys promise

Kennedy sat with his eyes shaded under his hand for fully an hour after
she had left Then he suddenly jumped up Walter he said let us go
over to Dr Bells I know the head nurse there We may possibly learn
something

As we sat in the waitingroom with its thick Oriental rugs and handsome
mahogany furniture I found myself going back to our conversation of
the early evening By Jove Kennedy you were right I exclaimed If
there is anything in this germplot idea of hers it is indeed the height
of the dramaticit is diabolical No ordinary mortal would ever be
capable of it

Just then the head nurse came in a large woman breathing of
germlessness and cheerfulness in her spotless uniform We were shown
every courtesy There was in fact nothing to conceal The visit set
at rest my last suspicion that perhaps Jim Bisbee had been poisoned by a
drug The charts of his temperature and the sincerity of the nurse were
absolutely convincing It had really been typhoid and there was nothing
to be gained by pursuing that inquiry further

Back at the apartment Craig began packing his suitcase with the few
things he would need for a journey Im going out to Bisbee Hall
tomorrow for a few days Walter and if you could find it convenient to
come along I should like to have your assistance

To tell you the truth Craig I am afraid to go I said

You neednt be Im going down to the army post on Governors Island
first to be vaccinated against typhoid Then I am going to wait a few
hours till it takes effect before going Its the only place in the city
where one can be inoculated against it so far as I know While three
inoculations are really best I understand that one is sufficient for
ordinary protection and that is all we shall need if any

Youre sure of it

Almost positive

Very well Craig Ill go

Down at the army post the next morning we had no difficulty in being
inoculated against the disease The work of immunising our army was
going on at that time and several thousands of soldiers in various
parts of the country had already been vaccinated with the best of
results Do many civilians come over to be vaccinated asked Craig of
Major Carroll the surgeon in charge

Not many for very few have heard of it he replied

I suppose you keep a record of them

Only their nameswe cant follow them up outside the army to see how
it works Still when they come to us as you and Mr Jameson have done
we are perfectly willing to vaccinate them The Army Medical Corps takes
the position that if it is good for the army it is good for civil life
and as long as only a few civilians apply we are perfectly willing to do
it for a fee covering the cost

And would you let me see the list

Certainly You may look it over in a moment

Kennedy glanced hurriedly through the short list of names pulled out
his notebook made an entry and handed the list back Thank you
Major

Bisbee Hall was a splendid place set in the heart of a great park whose
area was measured by square miles rather than by acres But Craig did
not propose to stay there for he arranged for accommodations in a
nearby town where we were to take our meals also It was late when we
arrived and we spent a restless night for the inoculation took It
wasnt any worse than a light attack of the grippe and in the morning
we were both all right again after the passing of what is called the
negative phase I for one felt much safer

The town was very much excited over the epidemic at the hall and if I
had been wondering why Craig wanted me along my wonder was soon set at
rest He had me scouring the town and country looking up every case or
rumour of typhoid for miles around I made the local weekly paper my
headquarters and the editor was very obliging He let me read all his
news letters from his local correspondent at every crossroads I waded
through accounts of new calves and colts new fences and barns who
Sundayed with his brother etc and soon had a list of all the
cases in that part of the country It was not a long one but it
was scattered After I had traced them out following Kennedys
instructions they showed nothing except that they were unrelated to
the epidemic at the hall

Meanwhile Kennedy was very busy there He had a microscope and slides
and testtubes and chemicals for testing things and I dont know what
all for there was not time to initiate me into all the mysteries He
tested the water from the various driven wells and in the watertank
and the milk from the cowshe tried to find out what food had come
in from outside though there was practically none for the hall was
selfsupporting There was no stone he left unturned

When I rejoined him that night he was clearly perplexed I dont think
my report decreased his perplexity either

There is only one thing left as far as I have been able to discover
after one days work he said after we had gone over our activities
for the day Jim Bisbee never drank the water from his own wells He
always drank a bottled water shipped down from a camp of his in New York
State where he had a remarkable mountain spring I tested a number of
the full bottles at the hall but they were perfectly pure There wasnt
a trace of the bacillus typhosus in any of them Then it occurred to me
that after all that was not the thing to do I should test the empty
ones But there werent any empty ones They told me they had all been
taken down to the freight station yesterday to be shipped back to the
camp I hope they havent gone yet Lets drive around and see if they
are there

The freightmaster was just leaving but when he learned we were from
the hall he consented to let us examine the bottles They were corked
and in wooden cases which protected them perfectly By the light of the
station lamps and the aid of a pocketlens Kennedy examined them on the
outside and satisfied himself that after being replaced in the wooden
cases the bottles themselves had not been handled

Will you let me borrow some of these bottles tonight he asked
the agent Ill give you my word that they will be returned safely
tomorrow If necessary Ill get an order for them

The stationagent reluctantly yielded especially as a small green
banknote figured in the transaction Craig and I tenderly lifted the big
bottles in their cases into our trap and drove back to our rooms in the
hotel It quite excited the hangerson to see us drive up with a lot of
empty fivegallon bottles and carry them upstairs but I had long ago
given up having any fear of public opinion in carrying out anything
Craig wanted

In our room we worked far into the night Craig carefully swabbed out
the bottom and sides of each bottle by inserting a little piece of
cotton on the end of a long wire Then he squeezed the water out of the
cotton swab on small glass slides coated with agaragar or Japanese
seaweed a medium in which germcultures multiply rapidly He put the
slides away in a little oven with an alcohollamp which he had brought
along leaving them to remain overnight at blood heat

I had noticed all this time that he was very particular not to touch any
of the bottles on the outside As for me I wouldnt have touched them
for the world In fact I was getting so I hesitated to touch anything
I was almost afraid to breathe though I knew there was no harm in that
However it was not danger of infection in touching the bottles that
made Craig so careful He had noted in the dim light of the station
lamps what seemed to be fingermarks on the bottles and they had
interested him in fact had decided him on a further investigation of
the bottles

I am now going to bring out these very faint fingerprints on the
bottles remarked Craig proceeding with his examination in the better
light of our room Here is some powder known to chemists as grey
powdermercury and chalk I sprinkle it over the faint markings so
and then I brush it off with a camelshair brush lightly That brings
out the imprint much more clearly as you can see For instance if
you place your dry thumb on a piece of white paper you leave no visible
impression If grey powder is sprinkled over the spot and then brushed
off a distinct impression is seen If the impression of the fingers is
left on something soft like wax it is often best to use printers ink
to bring out the ridges and patterns of the fingermarks And so on
for various materials Quite a science has been built up around
fingerprints

I wish I had that enlarging camera which I have in my laboratory
However my ordinary camera will do for all I want is to preserve a
record of these marks and I can enlarge the photographs later In the
morning I will photograph these marks and you can do the developing of
the films Tonight well improvise the bathroom as a darkroom and get
everything ready so that we can start in bright and early

We were indeed up early One never has difficulty in getting up early
in the country it is so noisy at least to a citybred man City noise
at five AM is sepulchral silence compared with bucolic activity at
that hour

There were a dozen negatives which I set about developing after Craig
had used up all our films Meanwhile he busied himself adjusting
his microscope and testtubes and getting the agar slides ready for
examination

Shirtsleeves rolled up I was deeply immersed in my work when I heard a
shout in the next room and the bathroom door flew open

Confound you Kennedy do you want to ruin these films I cried

He shut the door with a bang Hurrah Walter he exclaimed I think I
have it at last I have just found some most promising colonies of the
bacilli on one of my slides

I almost dropped the pan of acid I was holding in my excitement
Well I said concealing my own surprise Ive found out something
too Every one of these fingerprints so far is from the same pair of
hands

We scarcely ate any breakfast and were soon on our way up to the hall
Craig had provided himself at the local stationers with an inkingpad
such as is used for rubber stamps At the hall he proceeded to get the
impressions of the fingers and thumbs of all the servants

It was quite a long and difficult piece of work to compare the
fingerprints we had taken with those photographed in spite of the fact
that writers descant on the ease with which criminals are traced by this
system devised by the famous Galton However we at last finished the
job between us or rather Craig finished it with an occasional remark
from me His dexterity amazed me it was more than mere book knowledge

For a moment we sat regarding each other hopelessly None of the
fingerprints taken at the hall tallied with the photographed prints
Then Craig rang for the housekeeper a faithful old soul whom even the
typhoid scare could not budge from her post

Are you sure I have seen all the servants who were at the hall while
Mr Bisbee was here asked Craig

Why no siryou didnt ask that You asked to see all who are here
now There is only one who has left the cook Bridget Fallon She left
a couple of days agosaid she was going back to New York to get another
job Glad enough I was to get rid of her too for she was drunk most of
the time after the typhoid appeared

Well Walter I guess we shall have to go back to New York again
then exclaimed Kennedy Oh I beg pardon Mrs Rawson for
interrupting Thank you ever so much Where did Bridget come from

She came well recommended sir Here is the letter in my writingdesk
She had been employed by the CaswellJoneses at Shelter Island before
she came here

I may keep this letter asked Craig scanning it quickly

Yes

By the way where were the bottles of spring water kept

In the kitchen

Did Bridget take charge of them

Yes

Did Mr Bisbee have any guests during the last week that he was here

Only Mr Denny one night

Hm exclaimed Craig Well it will not be so hard for us to unravel
this matter after all when we get back to the city We must make that
noon train Walter There is nothing more for us to do here

Emerging from the Tube at Ninth Street Craig hustled me into a
taxicab and in almost no time we were at police headquarters

Fortunately Inspector Barney OConnor was in and in an amiable mood
too for Kennedy had been careful that the Central Office received a
large share of credit for the Kerr Parker case Craig sketched hastily
the details of this new case OConnors face was a study His honest
blue Irish eyes fairly bulged in wonder and when Craig concluded with
a request for help I think OConnor would have given him anything in the
office just to figure in the case

First I want one of your men to go to the surrogates office and
get the original of the will I shall return it within a couple of
hoursall I want to do is to make a photographic copy Then another
man must find this lawyer James Denny and in some way get his
fingerprintsyou must arrange that yourself And send another fellow
up to the employment offices on Fourth Avenue and have him locate this
cook Bridget Fallon I want her fingerprints too Perhaps she had
better be detained for I dont want her to get away Oh and say
OConnor do you want to finish this case up like the crack of a whip
tonight

Im game sir What of it

Let me see It is now four oclock If you can get hold of all
these people in time I think I shall be ready for the final scene
tonightsay at nine You know how to arrange it Have them all
present at my laboratory at nine and I promise we shall have a story
that will get into the morning papers with leaded type on the front
page

Now Walter he added as we hurried down to the taxicab again I
want you to drop off at the Department of Health with this card to the
commissioner I believe you know Dr Leslie Well ask him if he
knows anything about this Bridget Fallon I will go on uptown to the
laboratory and get my apparatus ready You neednt come up till nine
old fellow for I shall be busy till then but be sure when you come
that you bring the record of this Fallon woman if you have to beg
borrow or steal it

I didnt understand it but I took the card and obeyed implicitly It is
needless to say that I was keyed up to the greatest pitch of excitement
during my interview with the health commissioner when I finally got in
to see him I hadnt talked to him long before a great light struck me
and I began to see what Craig was driving at The commissioner saw it
first

If you dont mind Mr Jameson he said after I had told him as much
of my story as I could will you call up Professor Kennedy and tell him
Id like very much to be present tonight myself

Certainly I will I replied glad to get my errand done in firstclass
fashion in that way

Things must have been running smoothly for while I was sitting in our
apartment after dinner impatiently waiting for halfpast eight
when the commissioner had promised to call for me and go up to the
laboratory the telephone rang It was Craig

Walter might I ask a favour of you he said When the commissioner
comes ask him to stop at the Louis Quinze and bring Miss Bisbee up too
Tell her it is important No more now Things are going ahead fine

Promptly at nine we were assembled a curious crowd The health
commissioner and the inspector being members of the same political
party greeted each other by their first names Miss Bisbee was nervous
Bridget was abusive Denny was sullen As for Kennedy he was as usual
as cool as a lump of ice And Iwell I just sat on my feelings to keep
myself quiet

At one end of the room Craig had placed a large white sheet such as he
used in his stereopticon lectures while at the top of the tier of seats
that made a sort of little amphitheatre out of his lectureroom his
stereopticon sputtered

Moving pictures tonight eh said Inspector OConnor

Not exactly said Craig thoughyes they will be moving in another
sense Now if we are all ready Ill switch off the electric lights

The calcium sputtered some more and a square of light was thrown on the
sheet

Kennedy snapped a little announcer such as lecturers use Let me invite
your attention to these enlargements of fingerprints he began as
a huge thumb appeared on the screen Here we have a series of
fingerprints which I will show one after another slowly They are all
of the fingers of the same person and they were found on some empty
bottles of spring water used at Bisbee Hall during the two weeks
previous to the departure of Mr Bisbee for New York

Here are in succession the fingerprints of the various servants
employed about the houseand of a guest added Craig with a slight
change of tone They differ markedly from the fingerprints on the
glass he continued as one after another appeared all except this
last one That is identical It is Inspector what we call a composite
type of fingerprintin this case a combination of what is called the
loop and whorl types

No sound broke the stillness save the sputtering of the oxygen on the
calcium of the stereopticon

The owner of the fingers from which these prints were made is in this
room It was from typhoid germs on these fingers that the fever was
introduced into the drinking water at Bisbee Hall

Kennedy paused to emphasise the statement then continued I am now
going to ask Dr Leslie to give us a little talk on a recent discovery
in the field of typhoid feveryou understand Commissioner what I
mean I believe

Perfectly Shall I mention names

No not yet

Well began Dr Leslie clearing his throat within the past year or
two we have made a most weird and startling discovery in typhoid fever
We have found what we now call typhoid carrierspersons who do not
have the disease themselves perhaps never have had it but who are
literally living testtubes of the typhoid bacillus It is positively
uncanny Everywhere they go they scatter the disease Down at the
department we have the records of a number of such instances and our
men in the research laboratories have come to the conclusion that far
from being of rare occurrence these cases are comparatively common I
have in mind one particular case of a servant girl who during the past
five or six years has been employed in several families

In every family typhoid fever has later broken out Experts have traced
out at least thirty cases and several deaths due to this one person
In another case we found an epidemic up in Harlem to be due to a typhoid
carrier on a remote farm in Connecticut This carrier innocently
enough it is true contaminated the milksupply coming from that farm
The result was over fifty cases of typhoid here in this city

However to return to the case of the servant I have mentioned Last
spring we had her under surveillance but as there was no law by which
we could restrain her permanently she is still at large I think one
of the Sunday papers at the time had an account of herthey called
her Typhoid Bridget and in red ink she was drawn across the page in
gruesome fashion frying the skulls of her victims in a fryingpan over
a roaring fire That particular typhoid carrier I understand

Excuse me Commissioner if I interrupt but I think we have carried
this part of the programme far enough to be absolutely convincing said
Craig Thank you very much for the clear way in which you have put it

Craig snapped the announcer and a letter appeared on the screen He
said nothing but let us read it through

To whom it may concern

This is to certify that Bridget Fallon has been employed in my family at
Shelter Island for the past season and that I have found her a reliable
servant and an excellent cook

 A ST JOHN CASWELLJONES

Before God Mr Kennedy Im innocent screeched Bridget Dont have
me arrested Im innocent Im innocent

Craig gently but firmly forced her back into her chair

Again the announcer snapped This time the last page of Mr Bisbees
will appeared on the sheet ending with his signature and the witnesses

Im now going to show these two specimens of handwriting very greatly
enlarged he said as the stereopticon plates were shifted again

An author of many scientific works Dr Lindsay Johnson of London
has recently elaborated a new theory with regard to individuality in
handwriting He maintains that in certain diseases a persons pulse
beats are individual and that no one suffering from any such disease
can control even for a brief space of time the frequency or peculiar
irregularities of his hearts action as shown by a chart recording his
pulsation Such a chart is obtained for medical purposes by means of a
sphygmograph an instrument fitted to the patients forearm and supplied
with a needle which can be so arranged as to record automatically on
a prepared sheet of paper the peculiar force and frequency of the
pulsation Or the pulsation may be simply observed in the rise and fall
of a liquid in a tube Dr Johnson holds the opinion that a pen in
the hand of a writer serves in a modified degree the same end as the
needle in the firstnamed form of the sphygmograph and that in such
a persons handwriting one can see by projecting the letters greatly
magnified on a screen the scarcely perceptible turns and quivers
made in the lines by the spontaneous action of that persons peculiar
pulsation

To prove this the doctor carried out an experiment at Charing Cross
Hospital At his request a number of patients suffering from heart and
kidney diseases wrote the Lords Prayer in their ordinary handwriting
The different manuscripts were then taken and examined microscopically
By throwing them highly magnified on a screen the jerks or
involuntary motions due to the patients peculiar pulsations were
distinctly visible The handwriting of persons in normal health says
Dr Johnson does not always show their pulse beats What one can say
however is that when a document purporting to be written by a certain
person contains traces of pulse beats and the normal handwriting of
that person does not show them then clearly that document is a forgery

Now in these two specimens of handwriting which we have enlarged it is
plain that the writers of both of them suffered from a certain peculiar
disease of the heart Moreover I am prepared to show that the pulse
beats exhibited in the case of certain penstrokes in one of these
documents are exhibited in similar strokes in the other Furthermore I
have ascertained from his family physician whose affidavit I have here
that Mr Bisbee did not suffer from this or any other form of heart
disease Mr CaswellJones in addition to wiring me that he refused to
write Bridget Fallon a recommendation after the typhoid broke out in his
country house also says he does not suffer from heart disease in any
form From the tremulous character of the letters and figures in both
these documents which when magnified is the more easily detected I
therefore conclude that both are forgeries and I am ready to go farther
and say that they are forgeries from the same hand

It usually takes a couple of weeks after infection for typhoid to
develop a time sufficient in itself to remove suspicion from acts which
might otherwise be scrutinised very carefully if happening immediately
before the disease developed I may add also that it is well known
that stout people do very poorly when they contract typhoid especially
if they are old Mr Bisbee was both stout and old To contract typhoid
was for him a virtual deathwarrant Knowing all these facts a certain
person purposely sought out a crafty means of introducing typhoid fever
into Mr Bisbees family That person furthermore was inoculated
against typhoid three times during the month before the disease was
devilishly and surreptitiously introduced into Bisbee Hall in order to
protect himself or herself should it become necessary for that person to
visit Bisbee Hall That person I believe is the one who suffered from
an aneurism of the heart the writer or rather the forger of the two
documents I have shown by one of which he or she was to profit greatly
by the death of Mr Bisbee and the founding of an alleged school in a
distant part of the countrya subterfuge if you recall used in at
least one famous case for which the convicted perpetrator is now under a
life sentence in Sing Sing

I will ask Dr Leslie to take this stethoscope and examine the hearts
of everyone in the room and tell me whether there is anyone here
suffering from an aneurism

The calcium light ceased to sputter One person after another was
examined by the health commissioner Was it merely my imagination or
did I really hear a heart beating with wild leaps as if it would burst
the bonds of its prison and make its escape if possible Perhaps it
was only the engine of the commissioners machine out on the campus
driveway I dont know At any rate he went silently from one to the
other betraying not even by his actions what he discovered with the
stethoscope The suspense was terrible I felt Miss Bisbees hand
involuntarily grasp my arm convulsively Without disturbing the silence
I reached a glass of water standing near me on Craigs lecturetable and
handed it to her

The commissioner was bending over the lawyer trying to adjust the
stethoscope better to his ears The lawyers head was resting heavily
on his hand and he was heaped up in an awkward position in the cramped
lectureroom seat It seemed an age as Dr Leslie tried to adjust the
stethoscope Even Craig felt the excitement While the commissioner
hesitated Kennedy reached over and impatiently switched on the electric
light in full force

As the light flooded the room blinding us for the instant the large
form of Dr Leslie stood between us and the lawyer

What does the stethoscope tell you Doctor asked Craig leaning
forward expectantly He was as unprepared for the answer as any of us

It tells me that a higher court than those of New York has passed
judgment on this astounding criminal The aneurism has burst

I felt a soft weight fall on my shoulder The Morning Star did not have
the story after all I missed the greatest scoop of my life seeing
Eveline Bisbee safely to her home after she had recovered from the shock
of Dennys exposure and punishment




IV The Deadly Tube

For Heavens sake Gregory what is the matter asked Craig Kennedy
as a tall nervous man stalked into our apartment one evening Jameson
shake hands with Dr Gregory Whats the matter Doctor Surely your
Xray work hasnt knocked you out like this

The doctor shook hands with me mechanically His hand was icy The blow
has fallen he exclaimed as he sank limply into a chair and tossed an
evening paper over to Kennedy

In red ink on the first page in the little square headed Latest News
Kennedy read the caption Society Woman Crippled for Life by XRay
Treatment

A terrible tragedy was revealed in the suit begun today continued the
article by Mrs Huntington Close against Dr James Gregory an Xray
specialist with offices at Madison Avenue to recover damages for
injuries which Mrs Close alleges she received while under his care
Several months ago she began a course of Xray treatment to remove a
birthmark on her neck In her complaint Mrs Close alleges that Dr
Gregory has carelessly caused Xray dermatitis a skin disease of
cancerous nature and that she has also been rendered a nervous wreck
through the effects of the rays Simultaneously with filing the suit she
left home and entered a private hospital Mrs Close is one of the most
popular hostesses in the smart set and her loss will be keenly felt

What am I to do Kennedy asked the doctor imploringly You remember
I told you the other day about this casethat there was something queer
about it that after a few treatments I was afraid to carry on any more
and refused to do so She really has dermatitis and nervous prostration
exactly as she alleges in her complaint But before Heaven Kennedy
I cant see how she could possibly have been so affected by the few
treatments I gave her And tonight just as I was leaving the office
I received a telephone call from her husbands attorney Lawrence very
kindly informing me that the case would be pushed to the limit I tell
you it looks black for me

What can they do

Do Do you suppose any jury is going to take enough expert testimony
to outweigh the tragedy of a beautiful woman Do Why they can ruin
me even if I get a verdict of acquittal They can leave me with
a reputation for carelessness that no mere court decision can ever
overcome

Gregory you can rely on me said Kennedy Anything I can do to help
you I will gladly do Jameson and I were on the point of going out to
dinner Join us and after that we will go down to your office and talk
things over

You are really too kind murmured the doctor The air of relief that
was written on his face was pathetically eloquent

Now not a word about the case till we have had dinner commanded
Craig I see very plainly that you have been worrying about the blow
for a long time Well it has fallen The neat thing to do is to look
over the situation and see where we stand

Dinner over we rode downtown in the subway and Gregory ushered us
into an officebuilding on Madison Avenue where he had a very handsome
suite of several rooms We sat own in his waitingroom to discuss the
affair

It is indeed a very tragic case began Kennedy almost more tragic
than if the victim had been killed outright Mrs Huntington Close
isor rather I suppose I should say wasone of the famous beauties
of the city From what the paper says her beauty has been hopelessly
ruined by this dermatitis which I understand Doctor is practically
incurable

Dr Gregory nodded and I could not help following his eyes as he looked
at his own rough and scarred hands

Also continued Craig with his eyes half closed and his fingertips
together as if he were taking a mental inventory of the facts in the
case her nerves are so shattered that she will be years in recovering
if she ever recovers

Yes said the doctor simply I myself for instance am subject to
the most unexpected attacks of neuritis But of course I am under the
influence of the rays fifty or sixty times a day while she had only a
few treatments at intervals of many days

Now on the other hand resumed Craig I know you Gregory very
well Only the other day before any of this came out you told me the
whole story with your fears as to the outcome I know that that lawyer
of Closes has been keeping this thing hanging over your head for a
long time And I also know that you are one of the most careful Xray
operators in the city If this suit goes against you one of the most
brilliant men of science in America will be ruined Now having said
this much let me ask you to describe just exactly what treatments you
gave Mrs Close

The doctor led us into his Xray room adjoining A number of Xray tubes
were neatly put away in a great glass case and at one end of the room
was an operatingtable with an Xray apparatus suspended over it A
glance at the room showed that Kennedys praise was not exaggerated

How many treatments did you give Mrs Close asked Kennedy

Not over a dozen I should say replied Gregory I have a record of
them and the dates which I will give you presently Certainly they were
not numerous enough or frequent enough to have caused a dermatitis such
as she has Besides look here I have an apparatus which for safety
to the patient has few equals in the country This big leadglass bowl
which is placed over my Xray tube when in use cuts off the rays at
every point except exactly where they are needed

He switched on the electric current and the apparatus began to sputter
The pungent odour of ozone from the electric discharge filled the room
Through the leadglass bowl I could see the Xray tube inside suffused
with its peculiar yellowishgreen light divided into two hemispheres
of different shades That I knew was the cathode ray not the Xray
for the Xray itself which streams outside the tube is invisible to
the human eye The doctor placed in our hands a couple of fluoroscopes
an apparatus by which Xrays can be detected It consists simply of a
closed box with an opening to which the eyes are placed The opposite
end of the box is a piece of board coated with a salt such as
platinobarium cyanide When the Xray strikes this salt it makes it
glow or fluoresce and objects held between the Xray tube and the
fluoroscope cast shadows according to the density of the parts which the
Xrays penetrate

With the leadglass bowl removed the Xray tube sent forth its
wonderful invisible radiation and made the back of the fluoroscope
glow with light I could see the bones of my fingers as I held them up
between the Xray tube and the fluoroscope But with the leadglass bowl
in position over the tube the fluoroscope was simply a black box into
which I looked and saw nothing So very little of the radiation escaped
from the bowl that it was negligibleexcept at one point where there
was an opening in the bottom of the bowl to allow the rays to pass
freely through exactly on the spot on the patient where they were to be
used

The dermatitis they say has appeared all over her body particularly
on her head and shoulders added Dr Gregory Now I have shown you my
apparatus to impress on you how really impossible it would have been
for her to contract it from her treatments here Ive made thousands
of exposures with never an Xray burn beforeexcept to myself As for
myself Im as careful as I can be but you can see I am under the rays
very often while the patient is only under them once in a while

To illustrate his care he pointed out to us a cabinet directly back of
the operatingtable lined with thick sheets of lead From this cabinet
he conducted most of his treatments as far as possible A little
peephole enabled him to see the patient and the Xray apparatus while
an arrangement of mirrors and a fluorescent screen enabled him to
see exactly what the Xrays were disclosing without his leaving the
leadlined cabinet

I can think of no more perfect protection for either patient or
operator said Kennedy admiringly By the way did Mrs Close come
alone

No the first time Mr Close came with her After that she came with
her French maid

The next day we paid a visit to Mrs Close herself at the private
hospital Kennedy had been casting about in his mind for an excuse to
see her and I had suggested that we go as reporters from the Star
Fortunately after sending up my card on which I had written Craigs name
we were at length allowed to go up to her room

We found the patient reclining in an easy chair swathed in bandages
a wreck of her former self I felt the tragedy keenly All that social
position and beauty had meant to her had been suddenly blasted

You will pardon my presumption began Craig but Mrs Close I
assure you that I am actuated by the best of motives We represent the
New York Star

Isnt it terrible enough that I should suffer so she interrupted
but must the newspapers hound me too

I beg your pardon Mrs Close said Craig but you must be aware that
the news of your suit of Dr Gregory has now become public property I
couldnt stop the Star much less the other papers from talking about
it But I can and will do this Mrs Close I will see that justice is
done to you and all others concerned Believe me I am not here as a
yellow journalist to make newspaper copy out of your misfortune I am
here to get at the truth sympathetically Incidentally I may be able to
render you a service too

You can render me no service except to expedite the suit against that
careless doctorI hate him

Perhaps said Craig But suppose someone else should be proved to
have been really responsible Would you still want to press the suit and
let the guilty person escape

She bit her lip What is it you want of me she asked

I merely want permission to visit your rooms at your home and to talk
with your maid I do not mean to spy on you far from it but consider
Mrs Close if I should be able to get at the bottom of this thing find
out the real cause of your misfortune perhaps show that you are the
victim of a cruel wrong rather than of carelessness would you not be
willing to let me go ahead I am frank to tell you that I suspect there
is more to this affair than you yourself have any idea of

No you are mistaken Mr Kennedy I know the cause of it It was my
love of beauty I couldnt resist the temptation to get rid of even a
slight defect If I had left well enough alone I should not be here now
A friend recommended Dr Gregory to my husband who took me there
My husband wishes me to remain at home but I tell him I feel more
comfortable here in the hospital I shall never go to that house
againthe memory of the torture of sleepless nights in my room there
when I felt my good looks going goingshe shudderedis such that
I can never forget it He says I would be better off there but no I
cannot go Still she continued wearily there can be no harm in your
talking to my maid

Kennedy noted attentively what she was saying I thank you Mrs
Close he replied I am sure you will not regret your permission
Would you be so kind as to give me a note to her

She rang dictated a short note to a nurse signed it and languidly
dismissed us

I dont know that I ever felt as depressed as I did after that interview
with one who had entered a living death to ambition for while Craig had
done all the talking I had absorbed nothing but depression I vowed that
if Gregory or anybody else was responsible I would do my share toward
bringing on him retribution

The Closes lived in a splendid big house in the Murray Hill section The
presentation of the note quickly brought Mrs Closes maid down to us
She had not gone to the hospital because Mrs Close had considered the
services of the trained nurses quite sufficient

Yes the maid had noticed how her mistress had been failing had noticed
it long ago in fact almost at the time when she had begun the Xray
treatment She had seemed to improve once when she went away for a few
days but that was at the start and directly after her return she grew
worse again until she was no longer herself

Did Dr Gregory the Xray specialist ever attend Mrs Close at her
home in her room asked Craig

Yes once twice he call but he do no good she said with her French
accent

Did Mrs Close have other callers

But msieur everyone in society has many What does msieur mean

Frequent callersa Mr Lawrence for instance

Oh yes Mr Lawrence frequently

When Mr Close was at home

Yes on business and on business too when he was not at home He is
the attorney msieur

How did Mrs Close receive him

He is the attorney msieur Marie repeated persistently

And he did he always call on business

Oh yes always on business but well madame she was a very beautiful
woman Perhaps he like beautiful womeneh bien That was before the
Doctor Gregory treated madame After the doctor treated madame Msieur
Lawrence do not call so often Thats all

Are you thoroughly devoted to Mrs Close Would you do a favour for
her asked Craig pointblank

Sir I would give my life almost for madame She was always so good
to me

I dont ask you to give your life for her Marie said Craig but you
can do her a great service a very great service

I will do it

Tonight said Craig I want you to sleep in Mrs Closes room You
can do so for I know that Mr Close is living at the St Francis Club
until his wife returns from the sanitarium Tomorrow morning come to my
laboratoryCraig handed her his cardand I will tell you what to do
next By the way dont say anything to anyone in the house about it
and keep a sharp watch on the actions of any of the servants who may go
into Mrs Closes room

Well said Craig there is nothing more to be done immediately We
had once more regained the street and were walking uptown We walked in
silence for several blocks

Yes mused Craig there is something you can do after all Walter I
would like you to look up Gregory and Close and Lawrence I already
know something about them But you can find out a good deal with your
newspaper connections I would like to have every bit of scandal that
has ever been connected with them or with Mrs Close or he added
significantly with any other woman It isnt necessary to say that not
a breath of it must be publishedyet

I found a good deal of gossip but very little of it indeed seemed to
me at the time to be of importance Dropping in at the St Francis
Club where I had some friends I casually mentioned the troubles of the
Huntington Closes I was surprised to learn that Close spent little of
his time at the Club none at home and only dropped into the hospital
to make formal inquiries as to his wifes condition It then occurred
to me to drop into the office of Society Squibs whose editor I had
long known The editor told me with that nameless look of the cynical
scandalmonger that if I wanted to learn anything about Huntington
Close I had best watch Mrs Frances Tulkington a very wealthy Western
divorcee about whom the smart set were much excited particularly those
whose wealth made it difficult to stand the pace of society as it was
going at present

And before the tragedy said the editor with another nameless look as
if he were imparting a most valuable piece of gossip it was the talk
of the town the attention that Closes lawyer was paying to Mrs Close
But to her credit let me say that she never gave us a chance to hint
at anything andwell you know us we dont need much to make snappy
society news

The editor then waged even more confidential for if I am anything at
all I am a good listener and I have found that often by sitting tight
and listening I can get more than if I were a tooeager questioner

It really was a shamethe way that man Lawrence played his game he
went on I understand that it was he who introduced Close to Mrs T
They were both his clients Lawrence had fought her case in the courts
when she sued old Tulkington for divorce and a handsome settlement
he got for her too They say his fee ran up into the hundred
thousandscontingent you know I dont know what his game washere
he lowered his voice to a whisper but they say Close owes him a good
deal of money You can figure it out for yourself as you like Now Ive
told you all I know Come in again Jameson when you want some more
scandal and remember me to the boys down on the Star

The following day the maid visited Kennedy at his laboratory while I was
reporting to him on the result of my investigations

She looked worn and haggard She had spent a sleepless night and begged
that Kennedy would not ask her to repeat the experiment

I can promise you Marie he said that you will rest better
tonight But you must spend one more night in Mrs Closes room By the
way can you arrange for me to go through the room this morning when you
go back

Marie said she could and an hour or so later Craig and I quietly
slipped into the Close residence under her guidance He was carrying
something that looked like a miniature barrel and I had another package
which he had given me both carefully wrapped up The butler eyed us
suspiciously but Marie spoke a few words to him and I think showed him
Mrs Closes note Anyhow he said nothing

Within the room that the unfortunate woman had occupied Kennedy took
the coverings off the packages It was nothing but a portable electric
vacuum cleaner which he quickly attached and set running Up and down
the floor around and under the bed he pushed the cleaner He used
the various attachments to clean the curtains the walls and even the
furniture Particularly did he pay attention to the base board on
the wall back of the bed Then he carefully removed the dust from the
cleaner and sealed it up in a leaden box

He was about to detach and pack up the cleaner when another idea seemed
to occur to him Might as well make a thorough job of it Walter he
said adjusting the apparatus again Ive cleaned everything but the
mattress and the brass bars behind the mattress on the bed Now
Ill tackle them I think we ought to go into the suctioncleaning
businessmore money in it than in being a detective Ill bet

The cleaner was run over and under the mattress and along every crack
and cranny of the brass bed This done and this dust also carefully
stowed away we departed very much to the mystification of Marie and I
could not help feeling of other eyes that peered in through keyholes or
cracks in doors

At any rate said Kennedy exultingly I think we have stolen a march
on them I dont believe they were prepared for this not at least at
this stage in the game Dont ask me any questions Walter Then you
will have no secrets to keep if anyone should try to pry them loose
Only remember that this man Lawrence is a shrewd character

The next day Marie came looking even more careworn than before

Whats the matter mademoiselle asked Craig Didnt you pass a
better night

Oh mon Dieu I rest well yes But this morning while I am at
breakfast Mr Close send for me He say that I am discharged Some
servant tell of your visit and he verry angrry And now what is to
become of mewill madame his wife give a recommendation now

Walter we have been discovered exclaimed Craig with considerable
vexation Then he remembered the poor girl who had been an involuntary
sacrifice to our investigation Turning to her he said Marie I know
several very good families and I am sure you will not suffer for what
you have done by being faithful to your mistress Only be patient a few
days Go live with some of your folks I will see that you are placed
again

The girl was profuse in her thanks as she dried her tears and departed

I hadnt anticipated having my hand forced so soon said Craig after
she had gone leaving her address However we are on the right track
What was it that you were going to tell me when Marie came in

Something that may be very important Craig I said though I dont
understand it myself Pressure is being brought to bear on the Star to
keep this thing out of the papers or at least to minimise it

Im not surprised commented Craig What do you mean by pressure
being brought

Why Closes lawyer Lawrence called up the editor this morningI
dont suppose that you know but he has some connection with the
interests which control the Starand said that the activity of one of
the reporters from the Star Jameson by name was very distasteful to
Mr Close and that this reporter was employing a man named Kennedy to
assist him

I dont understand it Craig I confessed but here one day they give
the news to the papers and two days later they almost threaten us with
suit if we dont stop publishing it

It is perplexing said Craig with the air of one who was not a bit
perplexed but rather enlightened

He pulled down the district telegraph messenger lever three times and
we sat in silence for a while

However he resumed I shall be ready for them tonight

I said nothing Several minutes elapsed Then the messenger rapped on
the door

I want these two notes delivered right away said Craig to the boy
heres a quarter for you Now mind you dont get interested in a
detective story and forget the notes If you are back here quickly with
the receipts Ill give you another quarter Now scurry along

Then after the boy had gone he said casually to me Two notes to
Close and Gregory asking them to be present with their attorneys
tonight Close will bring Lawrence and Gregory will bring a young
lawyer named Asche a very clever fellow The notes are so worded that
they can hardly refuse the invitation

Meanwhile I carried out an assignment for the Star and telephoned my
story in so as to be sure of being with Craig at the crucial moment For
I was thoroughly curious about his next move in the game I found
him still in his laboratory attaching two coils of thin wire to the
connections on the outside of a queerlooking little black box

Whats that I asked eyeing the sinister looking little box
suspiciously An infernal machine Youre not going to blow the culprit
into eternity I hope

Never mind what it is Walter Youll find that out in due time It may
or it may not be an infernal machine of a different sort than any you
have probably ever heard of The less you know now the less likely you
are to give anything away by a look or an act Come now make yourself
useful as well as ornamental Take these wires and lay them in the
cracks of the floor and be careful not to let them show A little dust
over them will conceal them beautifully

Craig now placed the black box back of one of the chairs well down
toward the floor where it could hardly have been perceived unless one
were suspecting something of the sort While he was doing so I ran the
wires across the floor and around the edge of the room to the door

There he said taking the wires from me Now Ill complete the job
by carrying them into the next room And while Im doing it go over the
wires again and make sure they are absolutely concealed

That night six men gathered in Kennedys laboratory In my utter
ignorance of what was about to happen I was perfectly calm and so were
all the rest except Gregory He was easily the most nervous of us all
though his lawyer Asche tried repeatedly to reassure him

Mr Close began Kennedy if you and Mr Lawrence will sit over here
on this side of the room while Dr Gregory and Mr Asche sit on the
opposite side with Mr Jameson in the middle I think both of you
opposing parties will be better suited For I apprehend that at various
stages in what I am about to say both you Mr Close and you Dr
Gregory will want to consult your attorneys That of course would be
embarrassing if not impossible should you be sitting near each other
Now if we are ready I shall begin

Kennedy placed a small leaden casket on the table of his lecture hall
In this casket he commenced solemnly there is a certain substance
which I have recovered from the dust swept up by a vacuum cleaner in the
room of Mrs Close

One could feel the very air of the room surcharged with excitement
Craig drew on a pair of gloves and carefully opened the casket With his
thumb and forefinger he lifted out a glass tube and held it gingerly
at arms length My eyes were riveted on it for the bottom of the tube
glowed with a dazzling point of light

Both Gregory and his attorney and Close and Lawrence whispered to each
other when the tube was displayed as indeed they did throughout the
whole exhibition of Kennedys evidence

No infernal machine was ever more subtle said Craig than the tube
which I hold in my hand The imagination of the most sensational writer
of fiction might well be thrilled with the mysteries of this fatal tube
and its power to work fearful deeds A larger quantity of this substance
in the tube would produce on me as I now hold it incurable burns
just as it did on its discoverer before his death A smaller amount
of course would not act so quickly The amount in this tube if
distributed about would produce the burns inevitably providing I
remained near enough for a longenough time

Craig paused a moment to emphasise his remarks

Here in my hand gentlemen I hold the price of a womans beauty

He stopped again for several moments then resumed

And now having shown it to you for my own safety I will place it back
in its leaden casket

Drawing off his gloves he proceeded

I have found out by a cablegram today that seven weeks ago an order
for one hundred milligrams of radium bromide at thirtyfive dollars a
milligram from a certain person in America was filled by a corporation
dealing in this substance

Kennedy said this with measured words and I felt a thrill run through
me as he developed his case

At that same time Mrs Close began a series of treatments with
an Xray specialist in New York pursued Kennedy Now it is not
generally known outside scientific circles but the fact is that in
their physiological effects the Xray and radium are quite one and
the same Radium possesses this advantage however that no elaborate
apparatus is necessary for its use And in addition the emanation from
radium is steady and constant whereas the Xray at best varies slightly
with changing conditions of the current and vacuum in the Xray tube
Still the effects on the body are much the same

A few days before this order was placed I recall the following despatch
which appeared in the New York papers I will read it

Liege Belgium Oct 1910 What is believed to be the first
criminal case in which radium figures as a deathdealing agent is
engaging public attention at this university town A wealthy old
bachelor Pailin by name was found dead in his flat A stroke of
apoplexy was at first believed to have caused his death but a close
examination revealed a curious discolouration of his skin A specialist
called in to view the body gave as his opinion that the old man had been
exposed for a long time to the emanations of Xray or radium The police
theory is that M Pailin was done to death by a systematic application
of either Xrays or radium by a student in the university who roomed
next to him The student has disappeared

Now here I believe was the suggestion which this American criminal
followed for I cut it out of the paper rather expecting sooner or later
that some clever person would act on it I have thoroughly examined the
room of Mrs Close She herself told me she never wanted to return to
it that her memory of sleepless nights in it was too vivid That
served to fix the impression that I had already formed from reading
this clipping Either the Xray or radium had caused her dermatitis
and nervousness Which was it I wished to be sure that I would make no
mistake Of course I knew it was useless to look for an Xray machine in
or near Mrs Closes room Such a thing could never have been concealed
The alternative Radium Ah that was different I determined on
an experiment Mrs Closes maid was prevailed on to sleep in her
mistresss room Of course radiations of brief duration would do her no
permanent harm although they would produce their effect nevertheless
In one night the maid became extremely nervous If she had stayed under
them several nights no doubt the beginning of a dermatitis would have
affected her if not more serious trouble A systematic application
covering weeks and months might in the end even have led to death

The next day I managed as I have said to go over the room thoroughly
with a vacuum cleanera new one of my own which I had bought myself
But tests of the dust which I got from the floors curtains and
furniture showed nothing at all As a last thought I had however
cleaned the mattress of the bed and the cracks and crevices in the brass
bars Tests of that dust showed it to be extremely radioactive I had
the dust dissolved by a chemist who understands that sort of thing
recrystallised and the radium salts were extracted from the refuse
Thus I found that I had recovered all but a very few milligrams of the
radium that had been originally purchased in London Here it is in this
deadly tube in the leaden casket

It is needless to add that the night after I had cleaned out this
deadly element the maid slept the sleep of the justand would have been
all right when next I saw her but for the interference of the unjust on
whom I had stolen a march

Craig paused while the lawyers whispered again to their clients Then he
continued Now three persons in this room had an opportunity to secrete
the contents of this deadly tube in the crevices of the metal work of
Mrs Closes bed One of these persons must have placed an order through
a confidential agent in London to purchase the radium from the English
Radium Corporation One of these persons had a compelling motive
something to gain by using this deadly element The radium in this tube
in the casket was secreted as I have said in the metal work of Mrs
Closes bed not in large enough quantities to be immediately fatal
but mixed with dust so as to produce the result more slowly but no
less surely and thus avoid suspicion At the same time Mrs Close was
persuadedI will not say by whomthrough her natural pride to take a
course of Xray treatment for a slight defect That would further serve
to divert suspicion The fact is that a more horrible plot could hardly
have been planned or executed This person sought to ruin her beauty to
gain a most selfish and despicable end

Again Craig paused to let his words sink into our minds

Now I wish to state that anything you gentlemen may say will be used
against you That is why I have asked you to bring your attorneys
You may consult with them of course while I am getting ready my next
disclosure

As Kennedy had developed his points in the case I had been more and more
amazed But I had not failed to notice how keenly Lawrence was following
him

With half a sneer on his astute face Lawrence drawled I cannot
see that you have accomplished anything by this rather extraordinary
summoning of us to your laboratory The evidence is just as black
against Dr Gregory as before You may think youre clever Kennedy
but on the very statement of facts as you have brought them out there is
plenty of circumstantial evidence against Gregorymore than there
was before As for anyone else in the room I cant see that you have
anything on usunless perhaps this new evidence you speak of may
implicate Asche or Jameson he added including me in a wave of his
hand as if he were already addressing a jury Its my opinion that
twelve of our peers would be quite as likely to bring in a verdict of
guilty against them as against anyone else even remotely connected with
this case except Gregory No youll have to do better than this in
your next case if you expect to maintain that socalled reputation of
yours for being a professor of criminal science

As for Close taking his cue from his attorney he scornfully added I
came to find out some new evidence against the wretch who wrecked the
beauty of my wife All Ive got is a tiresome lecture on Xrays and
radium I suppose what you say is true Well it only bears out what I
thought before Gregory treated my wife at home after he saw the damage
his office treatments had done I guess he was capable of making a
complete job out of itcovering up his carelessness by getting rid
of the woman who was such a damning piece of evidence against his
professional skill

Never a shade passed Craigs face as he listened to this tirade Excuse
me a moment was all he said opening the door to leave the room I
have just one more fact to disclose I will be back directly

Kennedy was gone several minutes during which Close and Lawrence
fell to whispering behind their hands with the assurance of those who
believed that this was only Kennedys method of admitting a defeat
Gregory and Asche exchanged a few words similarly and it was plain that
Asche was endeavouring to put a better interpretation on something than
Gregory himself dared hope

As Kennedy reentered Close was buttoning up his coat preparatory to
leaving and Lawrence was lighting a fresh cigar

In his hand Kennedy held a notebook My stenographer writes a very
legible shorthand at least I find it sofrom long practice I suppose
As I glance over her notes I find many facts which will interest you
laterat the trial Butah here at the endlet me read

Well hes very clever but he has nothing against me has he

No not unless he can produce the agent who bought the radium for
you

But he cant do that No one could ever have recognised you on your
flying trip to London disguised as a diamond merchant who had just
learned that he could make his faulty diamonds good by applications of
radium and who wanted a good stock of the stuff

Still well have to drop the suit against Gregory after all in spite
of what I said That part is hopelessly spoiled

Yes I suppose so Oh well Im free now She can hardly help but
consent to a divorce now and a quiet settlement She brought it on
herselfwe tried every other way to do it but sheshe was too good to
fall into it She forced us to it

Yes youll get a good divorce now But cant we shut up this man
Kennedy Even if he cant prove anything against us the mere rumour of
such a thing coming to the ears of Mrs Tulkington would be unpleasant

Go as far as you like Lawrence You know what the marriage will mean
to me It will settle my debts to you and all the rest

Ill see what I can do Close Hell be back in a moment

Closes face was livid Its a pack of lies he shouted advancing
toward Kennedy a pack of lies You are a fakir and a blackmailer Ill
have you in jail for this by Godand you too Gregory

One moment please said Kennedy calmly Mr Lawrence will you be so
kind as to reach behind your chair What do you find

Lawrence lifted up the plain black box and with it he pulled up the
wires which I had so carefully concealed in the cracks of the floor

That said Kennedy is a little instrument called the microphone
Its chief merit lies in the fact that it will magnify a sound sixteen
hundred times and carry it to any given point where you wish to place
the receiver Originally this device was invented for the aid of the
deaf but I see no reason why it should not be used to aid the law
One neednt eavesdrop at the keyhole with this little instrument about
Inside that box there is nothing but a series of plugs from which wires
much finer than a thread are stretched taut Yet a fly walking near it
will make a noise as loud as a drafthorse If the microphone is placed
in any part of the room especially if near the persons talkingeven if
they are talking in a whispera whisper such as occurred several times
during the evening and particularly while I was in the next room getting
the notes made by my stenographera whisper I say is like shouting
your guilt from the housetops

You two men Close and Lawrence may consider yourselves under arrest
for conspiracy and whatever other indictments will lie against such
creatures as you The police will be here in a moment No Close
violence wont do now The doors are lockedand see we are four to
two




V The Seismograph Adventure

Dr James Hanson Coroners Physician Criminal Courts Building read
Craig Kennedy as he held a visitors card in his hand Then to the
visitor he added Take a chair Doctor

The physician thanked him and sat down Professor Kennedy he began
I have been referred to you by Inspector OConnor of the Detective
Bureau It may seem an impertinence for a city official to call on you
for assistance butwell you see Im completely floored I think
too that the case will interest you Its the Vandam case

If Dr Hanson had suddenly turned on the current of an induction coil
and I had been holding the handles I dont think the thrill I received
could have been any more sudden The Vandam case was the sensation of
the moment a triple puzzle as both Kennedy and myself had agreed Was
it suicide murder or sudden death Every theory so far had proved
unsatisfactory

I have read only what the newspapers have published replied Craig to
the doctors look of inquiry You see my friend Jameson here is on the
staff of the Star and we are in the habit of discussing these cases

Very glad to meet you Mr Jameson exclaimed Dr Hanson at the
implied introduction The relations between my office and your paper
have always been very satisfactory I can assure you

Thank you Doctor Depend on me to keep them so I replied shaking
his proffered hand

Now as to the case continued the doctor slowly Here is a beautiful
woman in the prime of life the wife of a very wealthy retired banker
considerably older than herselfperhaps nearly seventyof very fine
family Of course you have read it all but let me sketch it so you will
look at it from my point of view This woman apparently in good health
with every luxury money can buy is certain within a very few years
from her dower rights to be numbered among the richest women in
America Yet she is discovered in the middle of the night by her maid
seated at the table in the library of her home unconscious She never
regains consciousness but dies the following morning

The coroner is called in and as his physician I must advise him
The family physician has pronounced it due to natural causes the uremic
coma of latent kidney trouble Some of the newspapers I think the Star
among them have hinted at suicide And then there are others who have
flatly asserted it was murder

The coroners physician paused to see if we were following him Needless
to say Kennedy was ahead of him

Have you any facts in your possession which have not been given to the
public yet asked Craig

Im coming to that in a moment replied Dr Hanson Let me sketch
the case first Henry Vandam had becomewell very eccentric in his old
age we will say Among his eccentricities none seems to have impressed
the newspapers more than his devotion to a medium and her manager Mrs
May Popper and Mr Howard Farrington Now of course the case does not
go into the truth or falsity of spiritualism you understand You have
your opinion and I have mine What this aspect of the case involves is
merely the character of the medium and her manager You know of course
that Henry Vandam is completely under their control

He paused again to emphasise the point

You asked me if I was in possession of any facts which have not been
given to the press Yes I am And just there lies the trouble They are
so very conflicting as to be almost worse than useless as far as I can
see We found near the unfortunate woman a small pillbox with three
capsules still in it It was labelled One before retiring and bore
the name of a certain druggist and the initials Dr C W H Now I am
convinced that the initials are merely a blind and do not give any
clue The druggist says that a maid from the Vandam house brought in
the prescription which of course he filled It is a harmless enough
prescriptioncontains among other things four and a half grains of
quinine and onesixth of a grain of morphine Six capsules were prepared
altogether

Now of course my first thought was that she might have taken
several capsules at once and that it was a case of accidental morphine
poisoning or it might even be suicide But it cannot be either to my
mind for only three of the six capsules are gone No doubt also you
are acquainted with the fact that the one invariable symptom of
morphine poisoning is the contraction of the pupils of the eyes to a
pinpointoften so that they are unrecognisable Moreover the pupils
are symmetrically contracted and this symptom is the one invariably
present in coma from morphine poisoning and distinguishes it from all
other forms of death

On the other hand in the coma of kidney disease one pupil is dilated
and the other contractedthey are unsymmetrical But in this case
both the pupils are normal or only a very little dilated and they are
symmetrical So far we have been able to find no other poison than the
slight traces of morphine remaining in the stomach after so many hours
I think you are enough of a chemist to know that no doctor would dare go
on the stand and swear to death from morphine poisoning in the face of
such evidence against him The veriest tyro of an expert toxicologist
could too easily confute him

Kennedy nodded Have you the pillbox and the prescription

I have replied Dr Hanson placing them on the table

Kennedy scrutinised them sharply I shall need these he said Of
course you understand I will take very good care of them Is there
anything else of importance

Really I dont know said the physician dubiously Its rather out
of my province but perhaps you would think it important Its mighty
uncanny anyhow Henry Vandam as you doubtless know was much more
deeply interested in the work of this medium than was his wife Perhaps
Mrs Vandam was a bit jealousI dont know But she too had an
interest in spiritualism though he was much more deeply influenced by
Mrs Popper than she

Heres the strange part of it The old man believes so thoroughly in
rappings and materialisations that he constantly keeps a notebook in his
pocket in which he records all the materialisations he thinks he sees
and the rappings he hears along with the time and place Now it so
happened that on the night Mrs Vandam was taken ill he had
retiredI believe in another part of the house where he has a regular
seanceroom According to his story he was awakened from a profound
sleep by a series of rappings As was his custom he noted the time
at which they occurred Something made him uneasy and he said to his
controlat least this is his story

John is it about Mary

Three raps answered yes the usual code

What is the matter Is she ill

The three answering raps were so vigorous that he sprang out of bed and
called for his wifes maid The maid replied that Mrs Vandam had not
gone to bed yet but that there was a light in the library and she would
go to her mistress immediately The next moment the house was awakened
by the screams of the maid calling for help that Mrs Vandam was dying

That was three nights ago On each of the two succeeding nights
Henry Vandam says he has been awakened at precisely the same hour by a
rapping and on each night his control has given him a message from
his dead wife As a man of science I attribute the whole thing to an
overwrought imagination The original rappings may have been a mere
coincidence with the fact of the condition of Mrs Vandam However I
give this to you for what it is worth

Craig said nothing but as was his habit shaded his eyes with the
tips of his fingers resting his elbows on the arms of his chair I
suppose he said you can give me the necessary authority to enter the
Vandam house and look at the scene of these happenings

Certainly assented the physician but you will find it a queer
place There are spirit paintings and spirit photographs in every room
and Vandams own part of the housewell its creepy thats all I can
say

And also I suppose you have performed an autopsy on the body and will
allow me to drop into your laboratory tomorrow morning and satisfy
myself on this morphine point

Certainly replied the coroners physician at any time you say

At ten sharp then tomorrow I shall be there said Craig It is now
eightthirty Do you think I can see Vandam tonight What time do these
rappings occur

Why yes you surely will be able to see him tonight He hasnt
stirred from the house since his wife died He told me he momentarily
expected messages from her direct when she had got strong enough in her
new world I believe they had some kind of a compact to that effect The
rappings come at twelvethirty

Ah then I shall have plenty of time to run over to my laboratory
before seeing Mr Vandam and get some apparatus I have in mind No
Doctor you neednt bother to go with me Just give me a card of
introduction Ill see you tomorrow at ten Goodnightoh by the way
dont give out any of the facts you have told me

Jameson said Craig when we were walking rapidly over toward the
university this promises to be an uncommonly difficult case

As I view it now I said I have suspicions of everybody concerned
in it Even the view of the Star that it is a case of suicide due to
overwrought nerves may explain it

It might even be a natural death Craig added And that would make
it a greater mystery than evera case for psychical research One thing
that I am going to do tonight will tell me much however

At the laboratory he unlocked a glass case and took out a little
instrument which looked like two horizontal pendulums suspended by fine
wires There was a large magnet near each pendulum and the end of
each pendulum bore a needle which touched a circular drum driven by
clockwork Craig fussed with and adjusted the apparatus while I said
nothing for I had long ago learned that in applying a new apparatus
to doing old things Craig was as dumb as an oyster until his work was
crowned with success

We had no trouble in getting in to see Mr Vandam in his seanceroom
His face was familiar to me for I had seen him in public a number of
times but it looked strangely altered He was nervous and showed his
age very perceptibly

It was as the coroners physician had said The house was littered
with reminders of the cult books papers curious daubs of paintings
handsomely framed and photographs hazy overexposures I should have
called them but Mr Vandam took great pride in them and Kennedy quite
won him over by his admiration for them

They talked about the rappings and the old man explained where and when
they occurred They proceeded from a little cabinet or closet at one end
of the room It was evident that he was a thorough believer in them and
in the messages they conveyed

Craig carefully noted everything about the room and then fell to
admiring the spirit photographs if such they might be called

The best of all I do not display they are too precious said the old
man Would you like to see them

Craig assented eagerly and Vandam left us for a moment to get them In
an instant Craig had entered the cabinet and in a dark corner on the
floor he deposited the mechanism he had brought from the laboratory
Then he resumed his seat shutting the box in which he had brought the
mechanism so that it would not appear that he had left anything about
the room

Artfully he led the conversation along lines that interested the old
man until he seemed to forget the hour Not so Craig He knew it was
nearing halfpast twelve The more they talked the more uncanny did this
house and room of spirits seem to me In fact I was rapidly reaching
the point where I could have sworn that once or twice something
incorporeal brushed by me I know now that it was purely imagination
but it shows what tricks the imagination can play on us

Rap rap rap rap rap

Five times came a curiously hollow noise from the cabinet If it
had been possible I should certainly have fled it was so sudden and
unexpected The hall clock downstairs struck the halfhour in those
chimes written by Handel for St Pauls

Craig leaned over to me and whispered hoarsely Keep perfectly
stilldont move a hand or foot

The old man seemed utterly to have forgotten us Is that you John he
asked expectantly

Rap rap rap came the reply

Is Mary strong enough to speak to me tonight

Rap rap

Is she happy

Rap rap

What makes her unhappy What does she want Will you spell it out

Rap rap rap

Then after a pause the rapping started slowly and distinctly to spell
out words It was so weird and uncanny that I scarcely breathed Letter
after letter the message came nineteen raps for s eight for h
five for e according to the place in the alphabet numerically of
the required letter At last it was complete

She thinks you are not well She asks you to have that prescription
filled again

Tell her I will do it tomorrow morning Is there anything else

Rap rap came back faintly

John John dont go yet pleaded the old man earnestly It was easy
to see how thoroughly he believed in John as perhaps well he might
after the warning of his wifes death three nights before Wont you
answer one other question

Fainter almost imperceptibly came a rap rap

For several minutes the old man sat absorbed in thought trancelike
Then gradually he seemed to realise that we were in the room with
him With difficulty he took up the thread of the conversation where the
rappings had broken it

We were talking about the photographs he said slowly I hope soon
to get one of my wife as she is now that she is transfigured John has
promised me one soon

He was gathering up his treasures preparatory to putting them back in
their places of safekeeping The moment he was out of the room Craig
darted into the cabinet and replaced his mechanism in the box Then he
began softly to tap the walls At last he found the side that gave a
noise similar to that which we had heard and he seemed pleased to have
found it for he hastily sketched on an old envelope a plan of that part
of the house noting on it the location of the side of the cabinet

Kennedy almost dragged me back to our apartment he was in such a hurry
to examine the apparatus at his leisure He turned on all the lights
took the thing out of its case and stripped off the two sheets of ruled
paper wound around the two revolving drums He laid them flat on
the table and studied them for some minutes with evidently growing
satisfaction

At last he turned to me and said Walter here is a ghost caught in the
act

I looked dubiously at the irregular upanddown scrawl on the paper
while he rang up the Homicide Bureau of the Central Office and left word
for OConnor to call him up the first thing in the morning

Still eyeing with satisfaction the record traced on the sheets of paper
he lighted a cigarette in a matteroffact way and added It proves to
be a very much fleshandblood ghost this John It walked up to the
wall back of that cabinet rapped listened to old Vandam rapped
some more got the answer it wanted and walked deliberately away The
cabinet as you may have noticed is in a corner of the room with one
side along the hallway The ghost must have been in the hall

But who was it

Not so fast Walter laughed Craig Isnt it enough for one night
that we have found out that much

Fortunately I was tired or I certainly should have dreamed of rappings
and of John that night I was awakened early by Kennedy talking with
someone over the telephone It was Inspector OConnor

Of course I heard only one side of the conversation but as near as I
could gather Kennedy was asking the inspector to obtain several samples
of ink for him I had not heard the first part of the conversation and
was considerably surprised when Kennedy hung up the receiver and said

Vandam had the prescription filled again early this morning and it
will soon be in the hands of OConnor I hope I havent spoiled things
by acting too soon but I dont want to run the risk of a double
tragedy

Well I said it is incomprehensible to me First I suspected
suicide Then I suspected murder Now I almost suspect a murder and a
suicide The fact is I dont know just what I suspect Im like Dr
Hansonfloored I wonder if Vandam would voluntarily take all the
capsules at once in order to be with his wife

One of them alone would be quite sufficient if the ghost should take
a notion as I think it will to walk in the daytime replied Craig
enigmatically I dont want to run any chances as I have said I may
be wrong in my theory of the case Walter so let us not discuss this
phase of it until I have gone a step farther and am sure of my ground
OConnors man will get the capsules before Vandam has a chance to take
the first one anyhow The ghost had a purpose in that message for
OConnor tells me that Vandams lawyer visited him yesterday and in all
probability a new will is being made perhaps has already been made

We breakfasted in silence and later rode down to the office of Dr
Hanson who greeted us enthusiastically

Ive solved it at last he cried and its easy

Kennedy looked gravely over the analysis which Dr Hanson shoved into
his hand and seemed very much interested in the probable quantity
of morphine that must have been taken to yield such an analysis The
physician had a textbook open on his desk

Our old ideas of the infallible test of morphine poisoning are all
exploded he said excitedly beginning to read a passage he had marked
in the book

I have thought that inequality of the pupils that is to say where
they are not symmetrically contracted is proof that a case is not one
of narcotism or morphine poisoning But Professor Taylor has recorded
a case of morphine poisoning in which the unsymmetrical contraction
occurred

There now until I happened to run across that in one of the
authorities I had supposed the symmetrical contraction of the pupils
of the eyes to be the distinguishing symptom of morphine poisoning
Professor Kennedy in my opinion we can after all make out our case as
one of morphine poisoning

Is that case in the book all you base your opinion on asked Craig
with excessive politeness

Yes sir replied the doctor reluctantly

Well said Kennedy quietly if you will investigate that case quoted
from Professor Taylor you will find that it has been proved that the
patient had one glass eye

Then my contention collapses and she was not poisoned

No I do not say that All I say is that expert testimony would refute
us as far as we have gone But if you will let me make a few tests of my
own I can readily clear up that end of the case I now feel sure Let me
take these samples to my laboratory

I was surprised when we ran into Inspector OConnor waiting for us in
the corridor of the Criminal Courts Building as we left the office of
the coroners physician He rushed up to Kennedy and shoved into
his hand a pillbox in which six capsules rattled Kennedy narrowly
inspected the box opened it and looked thoughtfully at the six white
capsules lying so innocently within

One of these capsules would have been worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars to John said Craig contemplatively as he shut the box and
deposited it carefully in his inside vest pocket I dont believe
I even said good morning to you OConnor he continued I hope I
havent kept you waiting here long Have you obtained the samples of
ink

Yes Professor Here they are As soon as you telephoned this morning
I sent my men out separately to get them Theres the ink from the
druggist this is from the Vandam library this is from Farringtons
room and this is from Mrs Poppers apartment

Thank you Inspector I dont know what Id do without your help
said Kennedy eagerly taking four small vials from him Science is all
right but organisation enables science to work quickly And quickness
is the essence of this case

During the afternoon Kennedy was very busy in his laboratory where I
found him that night after my hurried dinner from which he was absent

What is it after dinnertime he exclaimed holding up a glass
beaker and watching the reaction of something he poured into it from a
testtube

Craig I believe that when you are absorbed in a case you would rather
work than eat Did you have any lunch after I left you

I dont think so he replied regarding the beaker and not his answer
Now Walter old fellow I dont want you to be offended with me
but really I can work better if you dont constantly remind me of such
things as eating and sleeping Say do you want to help mereally

Certainly I am as interested in the case as you are but I cant make
heads or tails of it I replied

Then I wish you would look up Mrs Popper tonight and have a private
seance with her What I want you to do particularly is to get a good
idea of the looks of the room in which she is accustomed to work Im
going to duplicate it here in my laboratory as nearly as possible Then
I want you to arrange with her for a private circle here tomorrow
night Tell her it is with a few professors at the university who are
interested in psychical research and that Mr Vandam will be present
Id rather have her come willingly than to force her to come
Incidentally watch that manager of hers Farrington By all means he
must accompany her

That evening I dropped casually in on Mrs Popper She was a woman
of great brilliance and delicacy both in her physical and mental
perceptions of exceptional vivacity and cleverness She must have
studied me more closely than I was aware of for I believe she relied on
diverting my attention whenever she desired to produce one of her really
wonderful results Needless to say I was completely mystified by her
performance She did spirit writing that would have done credit to the
immortal Slade told me a lot of things that were true and many more
that were unverifiable or hopelessly vague It was really worth much
more than the price and I did not need to feign the interest necessary
to get her terms for a circle in the laboratory

Of course I had to make the terms with Farrington The first glance
aroused my suspicions of him He was shiftyeyed and his face had a
hard and mercenary look In spite of perhaps rather because of my
repugnance we quickly came to an agreement and as I left the apartment
I mentally resolved to keep my eye on him

Craig came in late having been engaged in his chemical analyses all the
evening From his manner I inferred that they had been satisfactory
and he seemed much gratified when I told him that I had arranged
successfully for the seance and that Farrington would accompany the
medium

As we were talking over the case a messenger arrived with a note from
OConnor It was written with his usual brevity Have just found from
servants that Farrington and Mrs P have key to Vandam house Wish
I had known it before House shadowed No one has entered or left it
tonight

Craig looked at his watch It was a quarter after one The ghost
wont walk tonight Walter he said as he entered his bedroom for a
muchneeded rest I guess I was right after all in getting the capsules
as soon as possible The ghost must have flitted unobserved in there
this morning directly after the maid brought them back from the
druggist

Again the next morning he had me out of bed bright and early As we
descended from the Sixth Avenue L he led me into a peculiar little
shop in the shadow of the L structure He entered as though he knew
the place well but then that air of assurance was Kennedys stock in
trade and sat very well on him

Few people I suppose have ever had a glimpse of this workshop of magic
and deception This little shop of Marinas was the headquarters of the
magicians of the country Levitation and ghostly disappearing hands were
on every side The shelves in the back of the shop were full of nickel
brass wire wood and papiermache contrivances new and strange to the
eye of the uninitiated Yet it was all as systematic as a hardware shop

Is Signor Marina in asked Craig of a girl in the first room given
up to picture postcards The room was as deceptive as the trade for
it was only an anteroom to the storeroom I have described above This
storeroom was also a factory and half a dozen artisans were hard at
work in it

Yes the signor was in the girl replied leading us back into the
workshop He proved to be a short man with a bland open face and frank
eyes the very antithesis of his trade

I have arranged for a circle with Mrs May Popper began Kennedy
handing the man his card I suppose you know her

Indeed yes he answered I furnished her seance room

Well I want to hire for tonight just the same sort of tables
cabinets carpets everything that she hasonly hire you understand
but I am willing to pay you well for them It is the best way to get a
good sitting I believe Can you do it

The little man thought a moment then replied Si signor yesvery
nearly near enough I would do anything for Mrs Popper She is a good
customer But her manager

My friend here Mr Jameson has had seances with her in her own
apartment interposed Craig Perhaps he can help you to recollect just
what is necessary

I know very well signor I have the duplicate bill the bill which was
paid by that Farrington with a check from the banker Vandam Leave it to
me

Then you will get the stuff together this morning and have it up to my
place this afternoon

Yes Professor yes It is a bargain I would do anything for Mrs
Poppershe is a fine woman

Late that afternoon I rejoined Craig at his laboratory Signor Marina
had already arrived with a truck and was disposing the paraphernalia
about the laboratory He had first laid a thick black rug Mrs Popper
very much affected black carpets and I had noticed that Vandams room
was carpeted in black too I suppose black conceals everything that one
oughtnt to see at a seance

A cabinet with a black curtain several chairs a light deal table
several banjos horns and other instruments were disposed about the
room With a few suggestions from me we made a fair duplication of the
hangings on the walls Kennedy was manifestly anxious to finish and at
last it was done

After Marina had gone Kennedy stretched a curtain over the end of
the room farthest from the cabinet Behind it he placed on a shelf
the apparatus composed of the pendulums and magnets The beakers and
testtubes were also on this shelf

He had also arranged that the cabinet should be so situated that it was
next a hallway that ran past his laboratory

Tonight Jameson he said indicating a spot on the hall wall just
back of the cabinet I shall want you to bring my guests out here and
do a little spirit rappingIll tell you just what to do when the time
comes

That night when we gathered in the transformed laboratory there were
Henry Vandam Dr Hanson Inspector OConnor Kennedy and myself
At last the sound of wheels was heard and Mrs Popper drove up in a
hansom accompanied by Farrington They both inspected the room narrowly
and seemed satisfied I had as I have said taken a serious dislike
to the man and watched him closely I did not like his air of calm
assurance

The lights were switched off all except one sixteencandlepower lamp
in the farthest corner shaded by a deepred globe It was just light
enough to see to read very large print with difficulty

Mrs Popper began immediately with the table Kennedy and I sat on her
right and left respectively in the circle and held her hands and feet
I confess to a real thrill when I felt the light table rise first on two
legs then on one and finally remain suspended in the air whence it
dropped with a thud as if someone had suddenly withdrawn his support

The medium sat with her back to the curtain of the cabinet and several
times I could have sworn that a hand reached out and passed close to my
head At least it seemed so The curtain bulged at times and a breeze
seemed to sweep out from the cabinet

After some time of this sort of work Craig led gradually up to a request
for a materialisation of the control of Vandam but Mrs Popper refused
She said she did not feel strong enough and Farrington put in a hasty
word that he too could feel that there was something working against
them But Kennedy was importunate and at last she consented to see if
John would do some rapping even if he could not materialise

Kennedy asked to be permitted to put the questions

Are you the John who appears to Mr Vandam every night at
twelvethirty

Rap rap rap came the faint reply from the cabinet Or rather it
seemed to me to come from the floor near the cabinet and perhaps to be
a trifle muffled by the black carpet

Are you in communication with Mrs Vandam

Rap rap rap

Can she be made to rap for us

Rap rap

Will you ask her a question and spell out her answer

Rap rap rap

Craig paused a moment to frame the question then shot it out
pointblank Does Mrs Vandam know now in the other world whether
anyone in this room substituted a morphine capsule for one of those
ordered by her three days before she died Does she know whether the
same person has done the same thing with those later ordered by Mr
Vandam

John seemed considerably perturbed at the mention of capsules It
was a long time before any answer was forthcoming Kennedy was about to
repeat the question when a faint sound was heard

Rap

Suddenly came a wild scream It was such a scream as I had never
heard before in my life It came as though a dagger had been thrust into
the heart of Mrs Popper The lights flashed up as Kennedy turned the
switch

A man was lying flat on the floorit was Inspector OConnor He had
succeeded in slipping noiselessly like a snake below the curtain
into the cabinet Craig had told him to look out for wires or threads
stretched from Mrs Poppers clothing to the bulging curtain of the
cabinet Imagine his surprise when he saw that she had simply freed
her foot from the shoe which I was carefully holding down and with a
backward movement of the leg was reaching out into the cabinet behind
her chair and was doing the rapping with her toes

Lying on the floor he had grasped her foot and caught her heel with a
firm hand She had responded with a wild yell that showed she knew she
was trapped Her secret was out

Hysterically Mrs Popper began to upbraid the inspector as he rose to
his feet but Farrington quickly interposed

Something was working against us tonight gentlemen Yet you demanded
results And when the spirits will not come what is she to do She
forgets herself in her trance she produces herself the things that
you all could see supernaturally if you were in sympathy

The mere sound of Farringtons voice seemed to rouse in me all the
animosity of my nature I felt that a man who could trump up an excuse
like that when a person was caught with the goods was capable of almost
anything

Enough of this fake seance exclaimed Craig I have let it go
on merely for the purpose of opening the eyes of a certain deluded
gentleman in this room Now if you will all be seated I shall have
something to say that will finally establish whether Mary Vandam was the
victim of accident suicide or murder

With hearts beating rapidly we sat in silence

Craig took the beakers and testtubes from the shelf behind the curtain
and placed them on the little deal table that had been so merrily
dancing about the room

The increasing frequency with which tales of murder by poison appear
in the newspapers he began formally is proof of how rapidly this new
civilisation of ours is taking on the aspects of the older civilisations
across the seas Human life is cheap in this country but the ways
in which human life has been taken among us have usually been direct
simple aboveboard in keeping with our democratic and pioneer
traditions The pistol and the bowieknife for the individual the rope
and the torch for the mob have been the usual instruments of sudden
death But when we begin to use poisons most artfully compounded
in order to hasten an expected bequest and remove obstacles in its
waywell we are practising an art that calls up all the memories of
sixteenth century Italy

In this beaker he continued I have some of the contents of the
stomach of the unfortunate woman The coroners physician has found that
they show traces of morphine Was the morphine in such quantities as to
be fatal Without doubt But equally without doubt analysis could not
discover and prove it in the face of one inconsistency The usual test
which shows morphine poisoning failed in this case The pupils of her
eyes were not symmetrically contracted In fact they were normal

Now the murderer must have known of this test This clever criminal
also knew that to be successful in the use of this drug where others had
failed the drug must be skilfully mixed with something else In that
first box of capsules there were six The druggist compounded them
correctly according to the prescription But between the time when they
came into the house from the druggists and the time when she took the
first capsule that night someone who had access to the house emptied
one capsule of its harmless contents and refilled it with a deadly dose
of morphinea white powder which looks just like the powder already in
the capsules

Why then the normal pupils of the eyes Simply because the criminal
put a little atropine or belladonna with the morphine My tests show
absolutely the presence of atropine Dr Hanson said Craig bowing to
the physician

The best evidence however is yet to come A second box of six
capsules all intact was discovered yesterday in the possession of
Henry Vandam I have analysed the capsules One contains no quinine at
allit is all morphine and atropine It is without doubt precisely
similar to the capsule which killed Mrs Vandam Another night or so
and Henry Vandam would have died the same death

The old man groaned Two such exposures had shaken him He looked from
one of us to another as if not knowing in whom he could trust But
Kennedy hurried on to his next point

Who was it that gave the prescription to Mrs Vandam originally She is
dead and cannot tell The others wont tell for the person who gave her
that prescription was the person who later substituted the fatal capsule
in place of the harmless The original prescription is here I have been
able to discover from it nothing at all by examining the handwriting
Nor does the texture of the paper indicate anything to me But the
inkah the ink

Most inks seem very similar I suppose but to a person who has made a
study of the chemical composition of ink they are very different Ink
is composed of iron tannate which on exposure to air gives the black of
writing The original pigmentsay blue or blueblack inkis placed
in the ink to make the writing visible at first and gradually fades
giving place to the black of the tannate which is formed The dyestuffs
employed in the commercial inks of today vary in colour from pale
greenish blue to indigo and deep violet No two give identical
reactionsat all events not when mixed with the iron tannate to form
the pigment in writing

It is owing to the difference in these provisional colouring matters
that it is possible to distinguish between writing written with
different kinds of ink I was able easily to obtain samples of the
inks used by the Vandams by Mrs Popper by Mr Farrington and by the
druggist I have compared the writing of the original prescription with
a colour scale of my own construction and I have made chemical
tests The druggists ink conforms exactly to the writing on the two
pillboxes but not to the prescription One of the other three inks
conforms by test absolutely to the ink in that prescription signed Dr
C W H as a blind In a moment my chain of evidence against the owner
of that bottle of ink will be complete

I could not help but think of the two pendulums on the shelf behind
the curtain but Craig said nothing for a moment to indicate that he
referred to that apparatus We sat dazed Farrington seemed nervous
and ill at ease Mrs Popper who had not recovered from the hysterical
condition of her exposure with difficulty controlled her emotion
Vandam was crushed

I have not only arranged this laboratory so as to reproduce Mrs
Poppers seanceroom began Craig afresh but I have had the cabinet
placed in relatively the same position a similar cabinet occupies in Mr
Vandams private seanceroom in the Vandam mansion

One night Mr Jameson and myself were visiting Mr Vandam At
precisely twelvethirty we heard most unaccountable rappings from that
cabinet I particularly noted the position of the cabinet Back of
it ran a hallway That is duplicated here Back of this cabinet is a
hallway I had heard of these rappings before we went but was afraid
that it would be impossible for me to catch the ghost red handed There
is a limit to what you can do the first time you enter a mans house
and besides that was no time to arouse suspicion in the mind of
anyone But science has a way out of every dilemma I determined to
learn something of these rappings

Craig paused and glanced first at Farrington then at Mrs Popper and
then at Mr Vandam

Mr Jameson he resumed will escort the doctor the inspector Mr
Farrington Mrs Popper and Mr Vandam into my imitation hall of the
Vandam mansion I want each of you in turn to tiptoe up that hall to a
spot indicated on the wall back of the cabinet and strike that spot
several sharp blows with your knuckles

I did as Craig instructed tiptoeing up myself first so that they could
not mistake his meaning The rest followed separately and after a
moment we returned silently in suppressed excitement to the room

Craig was still standing by the table but now the pendulums with the
magnets and needles and the drums worked by clockwork were before him

Another person outside the Vandam family had a key to the Vandam
mansion he began gravely That person by the way was the one who
waited night by night until Mrs Vandam took the fatal capsule
and then when she had taken it apprised the old man of the fact and
strengthened an already blind faith in the shadow world

You could have heard a pin drop In fact you could almost have felt it
drop

That other person who unobserved had free access to the house he
continued in the breathless stillness is in this room now

He was looking at OConnor as if for corroboration OConnor nodded
Information derived from the butler he muttered

I did not know this until yesterday Kennedy continued but I
suspected that something of the sort existed when I was first told by
Dr Hanson of the rappings I determined to hear those rappings and
make a record of them So the night Mr Jameson and I visited Mr
Vandam I carried this little instrument with me

Almost lovingly he touched the pendulums on the table They were now
at rest and kept so by means of a lever that prevented all vibration
whatever

See I release this levernow let no one in the room move Watch
the needles on the paper as the clockwork revolves the drums I take a
stepever so lightly The pendulums vibrate and the needles trace a
broken line on the paper on each drum I stop the lines are practically
straight I take another step and another ever so lightly See the
delicate pendulums vibrate See the lines they trace are jagged lines

He stripped the paper off the drums and laid it flat on the table before
him with two other similar pieces of paper

Just before the time of the rapping I placed this instrument in the
corner of the Vandam cabinet just as I placed it in this cabinet after
Mr Jameson conducted you from the room In neither case were suspicions
aroused Everything in both cases was perfectly normalI mean the
ghost was in ignorance of the presence if not the very existence of
this instrument

This is an improved seismograph he explained one after a very
recent model by Prince Galitzin of the Imperial Academy of St
Petersburg The seismograph as you know was devised to register
earthquakes at a distance This one not only measures the size of
a distant earthquake but the actual direction from which the
earthtremors come That is why there are two pendulums and two drums

The magnetic arrangement is to cut short the vibrations set up in the
pendulums to prevent them from continuing to vibrate after the first
shock Thus they are ready in an instant to record another tremor Other
seismographs continue to vibrate for a long time as a result of one
tremor only Besides they give little indication of the direction from
which the tremors come

I think you must all appreciate that your tiptoeing up the hall must
cause a far greater disturbance in this delicate seismograph than even
a very severe earthquake thousands of miles away which it was built to
record

He paused and examined the papers sharply

This is the record made by the ghosts walk the other night he
said holding up two of them in his left hand Here on the table on
two other longer sheets I have records of the vibrations set up by
those in this room walking tonight

Here is Mr Jamesonshis is not a bit like the ghosts Nor is Mr
Vandams Least of all are Dr Hansons and Inspector OConnors for
they are heavy men

Now here is Mr Farringtonshe bent down closely he is a light
man and the ghost was light

Craig was playing with his victim like a cat with a mouse

Suddenly I felt something brush by me and with a swish of air and of
garments I saw Mrs Popper fling herself wildly at the table that bore
the incriminating records In another instant Farrington was on his feet
and had made a wild leap in the same direction

It was done so quickly that I must have acted first and thought
afterward I found myself in the midst of a melee with my hand at
his throat and his at mine OConnor with a jiujitsu movement bent
Farringtons other arm until he released me with a cry of pain

In front of me I saw Craig grasping Mrs Poppers wrists as in a vise
She was glaring at him like a tigress

Do you suppose for a moment that that toy is going to convince the
world that Henry Vandam has been deceived and that the spirit which
visited him was a fraud Is that why you have lured me here under false
pretences to play on my feelings to insult me to take advantage of a
lone defenceless woman surrounded by hostile men Shame on you she
added contemptuously You call yourself a gentleman but I call you a
coward

Kennedy always calm and collected ignored the tirade His voice was
as cold as steel as he said It would do little good Mrs Popper to
destroy this one link in the chain I have forged The other links are
too heavy for you Dont forget the evidence of the ink It was your
ink Dont forget that Henry Vandam will not any longer conceal that he
has altered his will in favour of you Tonight he goes from here to his
lawyers to draw up a new will altogether Dont forget that you have
caused the Vandams separately to have the prescription filled and that
you are now caught in the act of a double murder Dont forget that you
had access to the Vandam mansion that you substituted the deadly for
the harmless capsules Dont forget that your rappings announced the
death of one of your victims and urged the other a cruelly wronged and
credulous old man to leave millions to you who had deceived and would
have killed him

No the record of the ghost on the seismograph was not Mr
Farringtons as I implied at the moment when you so kindly furnished
this additional proof of your guilt by trying to destroy the evidence
The ghost was you Mrs Popper and you are at liberty to examine the
markings as minutely as you please but you must not destroy them You
are an astute criminal Mrs Popper but tonight you are under arrest
for the murder of Mary Vandam and the attempted murder of Henry Vandam




VI The Diamond Maker

Ive called Professor Kennedy to see if we can retain you in a case
which I am sure will tax even your resources Heaven knows it has taxed
ours

The visitor was a large wellbuilt man He placed his hat on the table
and without taking off his gloves sat down in an easy chair which he
completely filled

Andrews is my namethird vicepresident of the Great Eastern Life
Insurance Company I am the nominal head of the companys private
detective force and though I have some pretty clever fellows on
my staff weve got a case that so far none of us has been able to
unravel Id like to consult you about it

Kennedy expressed his entire willingness to be consulted and after the
usual formalities were over Mr Andrews proceeded

I suppose you are aware that the large insurance companies maintain
quite elaborate detective forces and follow very keenly such of the
cases of their policyholders as look at all suspicious This case which
I wish to put in your hands is that of Mr Solomon Morowitch a wealthy
Maiden Lane jeweller I suppose you have read something in the papers
about his sudden death and the strange robbery of his safe

Very little replied Craig There hasnt been much to read

Of course not of course not said Mr Andrews with some show of
gratification I flatter myself that we have pulled the wires so as to
keep the thing out of the papers as much as possible We dont want to
frighten the quarry till the net is spread The point is though to
find out who is the quarry Its most baffling

I am at your service interposed Craig quietly but you will have
to enlighten me as to the facts in the case As to that I know no more
than the newspapers

Oh certainly certainly That is to say you know nothing at all and
can approach it without bias He paused and then seeming to notice
something in Craigs manner added hastily Ill be perfectly frank
with you The policy in question is for one hundred thousand dollars
and is incontestable His wife is the beneficiary The company is
perfectly willing to pay but we want to be sure that it is all straight
first There are certain suspicious circumstances that in justice to
ourselves we think should be cleared up That is allbelieve me We are
not seeking to avoid an honest liability

What are these suspicious circumstances asked Craig apparently
satisfied with the explanation

This is in strict confidence gentlemen began Mr Andrews Mr
Morowitch according to the story as it comes to us returned home late
one night last week apparently from his office in a very weakened
a semiconscious condition His family physician Doctor Thornton was
summoned not at once but shortly He pronounced Mr Morowitch to be
suffering from a congestion of the lungs that was very like a sudden
attack of pneumonia

Mr Morowitch had at once gone to bed or at least was in bed when the
doctor arrived but his condition grew worse so rapidly that the doctor
hastily resorted to oxygen under which treatment he seemed to revive
The doctor had just stepped out to see another patient when a hurry call
was sent to him that Mr Morowitch was rapidly sinking He died before
the doctor could return No statement whatever concerning the cause of
his sudden illness was made by Mr Morowitch and the deathcertificate
a copy of which I have gives pneumonia as the cause of death One of
our men has seen Doctor Thornton but has been able to get nothing out
of him Mrs Morowitch was the only person with her husband at the
time

There was something in his tone that made me take particular note of
this last fact especially as he paused for an instant

Now perhaps there would be nothing surprising about it all so far
at least were it not for the fact that the following morning when his
junior partner Mr Kahan opened the place of business or rather went
to it for it was to remain closed of course he found that during
the night someone had visited it The lock on the great safe which
contained thousands of dollars worth of diamonds was intact but in
the top of the safe a huge hole was foundan irregular round hole big
enough to put your foot through Imagine it Professor Kennedy a great
hole in a safe that is made of chrome steel a safe that short of a
safetydeposit vault ought to be about the strongest thing on earth

Why that steel would dull and splinter even the finest diamonddrill
before it made an impression The mere taking out and refitting of
drills into the brace would be a most lengthy process Eighteen or
twenty hours is the time by actual test which it would take to bore
such a hole through those laminated plates even if there were means
of exerting artificial pressure As for the police they havent even a
theory yet

And the diamonds

All goneeverything of any value was gone Even the letterfiles were
ransacked His desk was broken open and papers of some nature had been
taken out of it Thorough is no name for the job Isnt that enough to
arouse suspicion

I should like to see that safe was all Kennedy said

So you shall so you shall said Mr Andrews Then we may retain you
in our service My car is waiting downstairs We can go right down to
Maiden Lane if you wish

You may retain me on one condition said Craig without moving I am
to be free to get at the truth whether it benefits or hurts the company
and the case is to be entirely in my hands

Hats on agreed Mr Andrews reaching in his vest pocket and pulling
out three or four brevas My chauffeur is quite a driver He can almost
beat the subway down

First to my laboratory interposed Craig It will take only a few
minutes

We drove up to the university and stopped on the campus while Craig
hurried into the Chemistry Building to get something

I like your professor of criminal science said Andrews to me blowing
a huge fragrant cloud of smoke

I for my part liked the vicepresident He was a man who seemed
thoroughly to enjoy life to have most of the good things and a
capacity for getting out of them all that was humanly possible He
seemed to be particularly enjoying this Morowitch case

He has solved some knotty cases was all I said Ive come to believe
there is no limit to his resourcefulness

I hope not Hes up against a tough one this trip though my boy

I did not even resent the my boy Andrews was one of those men in
whom we newspaper writers instinctively believe I knew that it would
be pens lifted only so long as the case was incomplete When the time
comes with such men they are ready to furnish us the best copy in the
world

Kennedy quickly rejoined us carrying a couple of little glass bottles
with groundglass stoppers

Morowitch  Co was of course closed when we arrived but we had
no trouble in being admitted by the Central Office man who had been
detailed to lock the barn door after the horse was stolen It was
precisely as Mr Andrews had said Mr Kahan showed us the safe Through
the top a great hole had been madeI say made for at the moment I was
at a loss to know whether it had been cut drilled burned blown out
or whatnot

Kennedy examined the edges of the hole carefully and just the trace
of a smile of satisfaction flitted over his face as he did so Without
saying a word he took the glass stopper out of the larger bottle which
he had brought and poured the contents on the top of the safe near the
hole There it lay a little mound of reddish powder

Kennedy took a little powder of another kind from the other bottle and
lighted it with a match

Stand backclose to the wall he called as he dropped the burning
mass on the red powder In two or three leaps he joined us at the far
end of the room

Almost instantly a dazzling intense flame broke out and sizzled and
crackled With bated breath we watched It was almost incredible but
that glowing mass of powder seemed literally to be sinking sinking
right down into the cold steel In tense silence we waited On the
ceiling we could still see the reflection of the molten mass in the cup
which it had burned for itself in the top of the safe

At last it fell through into the safefell as the burning roof of a
frame building would fall into the building No one spoke a word but as
we cautiously peered over the top of the safe we instinctively turned to
Kennedy for an explanation The Central Office man with eyes as big as
halfdollars acted almost as if he would have liked to clap the irons
on Kennedy For there in the top of the safe was another hole smaller
but identical in nature with the first one

Thermit was all Kennedy said

Thermit echoed Andrews shifting the cigar which he had allowed to go
out in the excitement

Yes an invention of a chemist named Goldschmidt of Essen Germany It
is a compound of iron oxide such as comes off a blacksmiths anvil or
the rolls of a rollingmill and powdered metallic aluminum You could
thrust a redhot bar into it without setting it off but when you
light a little magnesium powder and drop it on thermit a combustion is
started that quickly reaches fiftyfour hundred degrees Fahrenheit It
has the peculiar property of concentrating its heat to the immediate
spot on which it is placed It is one of the most powerful oxidising
agents known and it doesnt even melt the rest of the steel surface
You see how it ate its way through the steel Either black or red
thermit will do the trick equally well

No one said anything There was nothing to say

Someone uncommonly clever or instructed by someone uncommonly clever
must have done that job added Craig Well there is nothing more to
be done here he added after a cursory look about the office Mr
Andrews may I have a word with you Come on Jameson Good day Mr
Kahan Good day Officer

Outside we stopped for a moment at the door of Andrewss car

I shall want to see Mr Morowitchs papers at home said Craig
and also to call on Doctor Thornton Do you think I shall have any
difficulty

Not at all replied Mr Andrews not at all I will go with you
myself and see that you have none Say Professor Kennedy he broke
out that was marvellous I never dreamed such a thing was possible
But dont you think you could have learned something more up there in
the office by looking around

I did learn it answered Kennedy The lock on the door was
intactwhoever did the job let himself in by a key There is no other
way to get in

Andrews gave a low whistle and glanced involuntarily up at the window
with the sign of Morowitch  Co in gold letters several floors above

Dont look up I think that was Kahan looking out at us he said
fixing his eyes on his cigar I wonder if he knows more about this than
he has told He was the company you know but his interest in the
business was only very slight By George

Not too fast Mr Andrews interrupted Craig We have still to see
Mrs Morowitch and the doctor before we form any theories

A very handsome woman too said Andrews as we seated ourselves
in the car A good deal younger than Morowitch Say Kahan isnt a
badlooking chap either is he I hear he was a very frequent visitor
at his partners house Well which first Mrs M or the doctor

The house answered Craig

Mr Andrews introduced us to Mrs Morowitch who was in very deep
mourning which served as I could not help noticing rather to heighten
than lessen her beauty By contrast it brought out the rich deep colour
of her face and the graceful lines of her figure She was altogether a
very attractive young widow

She seemed to have a sort of fear of Andrews whether merely because he
represented the insurance company on which so much depended or because
there were other reasons for fear I could not of course make out
Andrews was very courteous and polite yet I caught myself asking if it
was not a professional rather than a personal politeness Remembering
his stress on the fact that she was alone with her husband when he
died it suddenly flashed across my mind that somewhere I had read of
a detective who as his net was being woven about a victim always grew
more and more ominously polite toward the victim I know that Andrews
suspected her of a close connection with the case As for myself I
dont know what I suspected as yet

No objection was offered to our request to examine Mr Morowitchs
personal effects in the library and accordingly Craig ransacked
the desk and the letterfile There was practically nothing to be
discovered

Had Mr Morowitch ever received any threats of robbery asked Craig
as he stood before the desk

Not that I know of replied Mrs Morowitch Of course every jeweller
who carries a large stock of diamonds must be careful But I dont think
my husband had any special reason to fear robbery At least he never
said anything about it Why do you ask

Oh nothing I merely thought there might be some hint as to the
motives of the robbery said Craig He was fingering one of those
deskcalendars which have separate leaves for each day with blank spaces
for appointments

Close deal Poissan he read slowly from one of the entries as if to
himself Thats strange It was the correspondence under the letter
P that was destroyed at the office and there is nothing in the
letterfile here either Who was Poissan

Mrs Morowitch hesitated either from ignorance or from a desire to
evade the question A chemist I think she said doubtfully My
husband had some dealings with himsome discovery he was going to buy
I dont know anything about it I thought the deal was off

The deal

Really Mr Kennedy you had better ask Mr Kahan My husband talked
very little to me about business affairs

But what was the discovery

I dont know I only heard Mr Morowitch and Mr Kahan refer to some
deal about a discovery regarding diamonds

Then Mr Kahan knows about it

I presume so

Thank you Mrs Morowitch said Kennedy when it was evident that she
either could not or would not add anything to what she had said Pardon
us for causing all this trouble

No trouble at all she replied graciously though I could see she was
intent on every word and motion of Kennedy and Andrews

Kennedy stopped the car at a drugstore a few blocks away and asked for
the business telephone directory In an instant under chemists he
put his finger on the name of PoissanHenri Poissan electric
furnacesWilliam St he read

I shall visit him tomorrow morning Now for the doctor

Doctor Thornton was an excellent specimen of the genus physician to
the wealthypolished cool suave One of Mr Andrewss men as I
have said had seen him already but the interview had been very
unsatisfactory Evidently however the doctor had been turning
something over in his mind since then and had thought better of it At
any rate his manner was cordial enough now

As he closed the doors to his office he began to pace the floor Mr
Andrews he said I am in some doubt whether I had better tell you or
the coroner what I know There are certain professional secrets that a
doctor must as a duty to his patients conceal That is professional
ethics But there are also cases when as a matter of public policy a
doctor should speak out

He stopped and faced us

I dont mind telling you that I dislike the publicity that would attend
any statement I might make to the coroner

Exactly said Andrews I appreciate your position exactly Your other
patients would not care to see you involved in a scandalor at least
you would not care to have them see you so involved with all the
newspaper notoriety such a thing brings

Doctor Thornton shot a quick glance at Andrews as if he would like to
know just how much his visitor knew or suspected

Andrews drew a paper from his pocket This is a copy of the
deathcertificate he said The Board of Health has furnished it
to us Our physicians at the insurance company tell me it is rather
extraordinarily vague A word from us calling the attention of the
proper authorities to it would be sufficient I think But Doctor that
is just the point We do not desire publicity any more than you do We
could have the body of Mr Morowitch exhumed and examined but I
prefer to get the facts in the case without resorting to such extreme
measures

It would do no good interrupted the doctor hastily And if youll
save me the publicity Ill tell you why

Andrews nodded but still held the deathcertificate where the doctor
was constantly reminded of it

In that certificate I have put down the cause of death as congestion
of the lungs due to an acute attack of pneumonia That is substantially
correct as far as it goes When I was summoned to see Mr Morowitch
I found him in a semiconscious state and scarcely breathing Mrs
Morowitch told me that he had been brought home in a taxicab by a man
who had picked him up on William Street Im frank to say that at first
sight I thought it was a case of plain intoxication for Mr Morowitch
sometimes indulged a little freely when he made a splendid deal I
smelled his breath which was very feeble It had a sickish sweet odour
but that did not impress me at the time I applied my stethoscope to
his lungs There was a very marked congestion and I made as my working
diagnosis pneumonia It was a case for quick and heroic action In a
very few minutes I had a tank of oxygen from the hospital

In the meantime I had thought over that sweetish odour and it flashed
on my mind that it might after all be a case of poisoning When the
oxygen arrived I administered it at once As it happens the Rockefeller
Institute has just published a report of experiments with a new antidote
for various poisons which consists simply in a new method of enforced
breathing and throwing off the poison by oxidising it in that way In
either casethe pneumonia theory or the poison theorythis line of
action was the best that I could have adopted on the spur of the moment
I gave him some strychnine to strengthen his heart and by hard work I
had him resting apparently a little easier A nurse had been sent for
but had not arrived when a messenger came to me telling of a very sudden
illness of Mrs Morey the wife of the steelmagnate As the Morey home
is only a halfblock away I left Mr Morowitch with very particular
instructions to his wife as to what to do

I had intended to return immediately but before I got back Mr
Morowitch was dead Now I think Ive told you all You see it was
nothing but a suspicionhardly enough to warrant making a fuss about
I made out the deathcertificate as you see Probably that would have
been all there was to it if I hadnt heard of this incomprehensible
robbery That set me thinking again There Im glad Ive got it out of
my system Ive thought about it a good deal since your man was here to
see me

What do you suspect was the cause of that sweetish odour asked
Kennedy

The doctor hesitated Mind it is only a suspicion Cyanide of
potassium or cyanogen gas either would give such an odour

Your treatment would have been just the same had you been certain

Practically the same the Rockefeller treatment

Could it have been suicide asked Andrews

There was no motive for it I believe replied the doctor

But was there any such poison in the Morowitch house

I know that they were much interested in photography Cyanide of
potassium is used in certain processes in photography

Who was interested in photography Mr or Mrs Morowitch

Both of them

Was Mrs Morowitch

Both of them repeated the doctor hastily It was evident how
Andrewss questions were tending and it was also evident that the
doctor did not wish to commit himself or even to be misunderstood

Kennedy had sat silently for some minutes turning the thing over in his
mind Apparently disregarding Andrews entirely he now asked Doctor
supposing it had been cyanogen gas which caused the congestion of the
lungs and supposing it had not been inhaled in quantities large enough
to kill outright do you nevertheless feel that Mr Morowitch was in a
weak enough condition to die as a result of the congestion produced by
the gas after the traces of the cyanogen had been perhaps thrown off

That is precisely the impression which I wished to convey

Might I ask whether in his semiconscious state he said anything that
might at all serve as a clue

He talked ramblingly incoherently As near as I can remember it he
seemed to believe himself to have become a millionaire a billionaire
He talked of diamonds diamonds diamonds He seemed to be picking them
up running his fingers through them and once I remember he seemed to
want to send for Mr Kahan and tell him something I can make them
Kahan he said the finest the largest the whitestI can make
them

Kennedy was all attention as Dr Thornton added this new evidence

You know concluded the doctor that in cyanogen poisoning there
might be hallucinations of the wildest kind But then too in the
delirium of pneumonia it might be the same

I could see by the way Kennedy acted that for the first time a ray of
light had dawned upon him in tracing out the case As we rose to go
the doctor shook hands with us His last words were said with an air of
great relief Gentlemen I have eased my conscience considerably

As we parted for the night Kennedy faced Andrews You recall that you
promised me one thing when I took up this case he asked

Andrews nodded

Then take no steps until I tell you Shadow Mrs Morowitch and Mr
Kahan but do not let them know you suspect them of anything Let me run
down this Poissan clue In other words leave the case entirely in my
hands in other respects Let me know any new facts you may unearth and
some time tomorrow I shall call on you and we will determine what the
next step is to be Good night I want to thank you for putting me in
the way of this case I think we shall all be surprised at the outcome

It was late the following afternoon before I saw Kennedy again He was
in his laboratory winding two strands of platinum wire carefully about
a piece of porcelain and smearing on it some peculiar black glassy
granular substance that came in a sort of pencil like a stick of
sealingwax I noticed that he was very particular to keep the two wires
exactly the same distance from each other throughout the entire length
of the piece of porcelain but I said nothing to distract his attention
though a thousand questions about the progress of the case were at my
tongues end

Instead I watched him intently The black substance formed a sort of
bridge connecting and covering the wires When he had finished he said
Now you can ask me your questions while I heat and anneal this little
contrivance I see you are bursting with curiosity

Well did you see Poissan I asked

Kennedy continued to heat the wirecovered porcelain I did and he is
going to give me a demonstration of his discovery tonight

His discovery

You remember Morowitchs hallucination as the doctor called it That
was no hallucination that was a reality This man Poissan says he has
discovered a way to make diamonds artificially out of pure carbon in an
electric furnace Morowitch I believe was to buy his secret His dream
of millions was a realityat least to him

And did Kahan and Mrs Morowitch know it I asked quickly

I dont know yet replied Craig finishing the annealing

The black glassy substance was now a dull grey

Whats that stuff you were putting on the wire I asked

Oh just a byproduct made in the manufacture of sulphuric acid
answered Kennedy airily adding as if to change the subject I want
you to go with me tonight I told Poissan I was a professor in the
university and that I would bring one of our younger trustees the son
of the banker T Pierpont Spencer who might put some capital into his
scheme Now Jameson while Im finishing up my work here run over to
the apartment and get my automatic revolver I may need it tonight I
have communicated with Andrews and he will be ready The demonstration
will take place at halfpasteight at Poissans laboratory I tried to
get him to give it here but he absolutely refused

Half an hour later I rejoined Craig at his laboratory and we rode down
to the Great Eastern Life Building

Andrews was waiting for us in his solidly furnished office Outside I
noted a couple of husky men who seemed to be waiting for orders from
their chief

From the manner in which the vicepresident greeted us it was evident
that he was keenly interested in what Kennedy was about to do So
you think Morowitchs deal was a deal to purchase the secret of
diamondmaking he mused

I feel sure of it replied Craig I felt sure of it the moment I
looked up Poissan and found that he was a manufacturer of electric
furnaces Dont you remember the famous Lemoine case in London and
Paris

Yes but Lemoine was a fakir of the first water said Andrews Do you
think this man is too

Thats what Im going to find out tonight before I take another step
said Craig Of course there can be no doubt that by proper use the
electric furnace will make small almost microscopic diamonds It is not
unreasonable to suppose that some day someone will be able to make large
diamonds synthetically by the same process

Maybe this man has done it agreed Andrews Who knows Ill wager
that if he has and that if Morowitch had bought an interest in his
process Kahan knew of it Hes a sharp one And Mrs Morowitch doesnt
let grass grow under her feet when it comes to seeing the main chance
as to money Now just supposing Mr Morowitch had bought an interest in
a secret like that and supposing Kahan was in love with Mrs Morowitch
and that they

Let us suppose nothing Mr Andrews interrupted Kennedy At least
not yet Let me see it is now ten minutes after eight Poissans place
is only a few blocks from here Id like to get there a few minutes
early Lets start

As we left the office Andrews signalled to the two men outside and
they quietly followed a few feet in the rear but without seeming to be
with us

Poissans laboratory was at the top of a sort of loft building a dozen
stories or so high It was a peculiar building with several entrances
besides a freight elevator at the rear and fireescapes that led to
adjoining lower roofs

We stopped around the corner in the shadow and Kennedy and Andrews
talked earnestly As near as I could make out Kennedy was insisting that
it would be best for Andrews and his men not to enter the building
at all but wait downstairs while he and I went up At last the
arrangement was agreed on

Here said Kennedy undoing a package he had carried is a little
electric bell with a couple of fresh dry batteries attached to it and
wires that will reach at least four hundred feet You and the men wait
in the shadow here by this side entrance for five minutes after Jameson
and I go up Then you must engage the night watchman in some way While
he is away you will find two wires dangling down the elevator shaft
Attach them to these wires from the bell and the batteriesthese
twoyou know how to do that The wires will be hanging in the third
shaftonly one elevator is running at night the first The moment you
hear the bell begin to ring jump into the elevator and come up to the
twelfth floorwell need you

As Kennedy and I rode up in the elevator I could not help thinking what
an ideal place a downtown office building is for committing a crime
even at this early hour of the evening If the streets were deserted
the officebuildings were positively uncanny in their grim black
silence with only here and there a light

The elevator in the first shaft shot down again to the ground floor and
as it disappeared Kennedy took two spools of wire from his pocket and
hastily shoved them through the lattice work the third elevator shaft
They quickly unrolled and I could hear them strike the top of the empty
car below in the basement That meant that Andrews on the ground floor
could reach the wires and attach them to the bell

Quickly in the darkness Kennedy attached the ends of the wires to the
curious little coil I had seen him working on in the laboratory and we
proceeded down the hall to the rooms occupied by Poissan Kennedy had
allowed for the wire to reach from the elevatorshaft up this hall
also and as he walked he paid it out in such a manner that it fell on
the floor close to the wall where in the darkness it would never be
noticed or stumbled over

Around an L in the hall I could see a groundglass window with a light
shining through it Kennedy stopped at the window and quickly placed
the little coil on the ledge close up against the glass with the wires
running from it down the hall Then we entered

On time to the minute Professor exclaimed Poissan snapping his
watch And this I presume is the banker who is interested in my
great discovery of making artificial diamonds of any size or colour he
added indicating me

Yes answered Craig as I told you a son of Mr T Pierpont
Spencer

I shook hands with as much dignity as I could assume for the role of
impersonation was a new one to me

Kennedy carelessly laid his coat and hat on the inside ledge of the
groundglass window just opposite the spot where he had placed the
little coil on the other side of the glass I noted that the window was
simply a large pane of wireglass set in the wall for the purpose of
admitting light in the daytime from the hall outside

The whole thing seemed eerie to meespecially as Poissans assistant
was a huge fellow and had an evil look such as I had seen in pictures of
the inhabitants of quarters of Paris which one does not frequent except
in the company of a safe guide I was glad Kennedy had brought his
revolver and rather vexed that he had not told me to do likewise
However I trusted that Craig knew what he was about

We seated ourselves some distance from a table on which was a huge
plain oblong contrivance that reminded me of the diagram of a
parallelopiped which had caused so much trouble in my solid geometry at
college

Thats the electric furnace sir said Craig to me with an assumed
deference becoming a college professor explaining things to the son
of a great financier You see the electrodes at either end When the
current is turned on and led through them into the furnace you can get
the most amazing temperatures in the crucible The most refractory of
chemical compounds can be broken up by that heat What is the highest
temperature you have attained Professor

Something over three thousand degrees Centigrade replied Poissan as
he and his assistant busied themselves about the furnace

We sat watching him in silence

Ah gentlemen now I am ready he exclaimed at length when everything
was arranged to his satisfaction You see here is a lump of sugar
carbonpure amorphous carbon Diamonds as you know are composed of
pure carbon crystallised under enormous pressure Now my theory is that
if we can combine an enormous pressure and an enormous heat we can make
diamonds artificially The problem of pressure is the thing for here
in the furnace we have the necessary heat It occurred to me that when
molten cast iron cools it exerts a tremendous pressure That pressure is
what I use

You know Spencer solid iron floats on molten iron like solid
watericefloats on liquid water explained Craig to me

Poissan nodded I take this sugar carbon and place it in this soft iron
cup Then I screw on this cap over the cup so Now I place this mass of
iron scraps in the crucible of the furnace and start the furnace

He turned a switch and long yellowishblue sheets of flame spurted out
from the electrodes on either side It was weird gruesome One could
feel the heat of the tremendous electric discharge

As I looked at the bluishyellow flames they gradually changed to a
beautiful purple and a sickish sweet odour filled the room The
furnace roared at first but as the vapors increased it became a better
conductor of the electricity and the roaring ceased

In almost no time the mass of iron scraps became molten Suddenly
Poissan plunged the castiron cup into the seething mass The cup
floated and quickly began to melt As it did so he waited attentively
until the proper moment Then with a deft motion he seized the whole
thing with a long pair of tongs and plunged it into a vat of running
water A huge cloud of steam filled the room

I felt a drowsy sensation stealing over me as the sickish sweet smell
from the furnace increased Gripping the chair I roused myself and
watched Poissan attentively He was working rapidly As the molten mass
cooled and solidified he took it out of the water and laid it on an
anvil

Then his assistant began to hammer it with careful sharp blows
chipping off the outside

You see we have to get down to the core of carbon gently he said as
he picked up the little pieces of iron and threw them into a scrapbox
First rather brittle cast iron then hard iron then iron and carbon
then some black diamonds and in the very centre the diamonds

Ah we are getting to them Here is a small diamond See Mr
Spencergently Francoiswe shall come to the large ones presently

One moment Professor Poissan interrupted Craig let your assistant
break them out while I stand over him

Impossible You would not know when you saw them They are just rough
stones

Oh yes I would

No stay where you are Unless I attend to it the diamonds might be
ruined

There was something peculiar about his insistence but after he picked
out the next diamond I was hardly prepared for Kennedys next remark

Let me see the palms of your hands

Poissan shot an angry glance at Kennedy but he did not open his hands

I merely wish to convince you Mr Spencer said Kennedy to me
that it is no sleightofhand trick and that the professor has not
several uncut stones palmed in his hand like a prestidigitator

The Frenchman faced us his face livid with rage You call me a
prestidigitator a fraudyou shall suffer for that Sacrebleu Ventre
du Saint Gris No man ever insults the honour of Poissan Francois
water on the electrodes

The assistant dashed a few drops of water on the electrodes The sickish
odour increased tremendously I felt myself almost going but with an
effort I again roused myself I wondered how Craig stood the fumes for
I suffered an intense headache and nausea

Stop Craig thundered Theres enough cyanogen in this room already
I know your gamethe water forms acetylene with the carbon and that
uniting with the nitrogen of the air under the terrific heat of the
electric arc forms hydrocyanic acid Would you poison us too Do you
think you can put me unconscious out on the street and have a society
doctor diagnose my case as pneumonia Or do you think we shall die
quietly in some hospital as a certain New York banker did last year
after he had watched an alchemist make silver out of apparently
nothing

The effect on Poissan was terrible He advanced toward Kennedy the
veins in his face fairly standing out Shaking his forefinger he
shouted You know that do you You are no professor and this is no
banker You are spies spies You come from the friends of Morowitch do
you You have gone too far with me

Kennedy said nothing but retreated and took his coat and hat off the
window ledge The hideous penetrating light of the tongues of flame from
the furnace played on the groundglass window

Poissan laughed a hollow laugh

Put down your hat and coat Mistair Kennedy he hissed The door has
been locked ever since you have been here Those windows are barred the
telephone wire is cut and it is three hundred feet to the street We
shall leave you here when the fumes have overcome you Francois and
I can stand them up to a point and when we reach that point we are
going

Instead of being cowed Kennedy grew bolder though I for my part felt
so weakened that I feared the outcome of a handtohand encounter with
either Poissan or Francois who appeared as fresh as if nothing had
happened They were hurriedly preparing to leave us


That would do you no good Kennedy rejoined for we have no safe full
of jewels for you to rob There are no keys to offices to be stolen from
our pockets And let me tell youyou are not the only man in New York
who knows the secret of thermite I have told the secret to the
police and they are only waiting to find who destroyed Morowitchs
correspondence under the letter P to apprehend the robber of his safe
Your secret is out

Revenge revenge Poissan cried I will have revenge Francois
bring out the jewelsha hahere in this bag are the jewels of Mr
Morowitch Tonight Francois and I will go down by the back elevator to
a secret exit In two hours all your police in New York cannot find us
But in two hours you two impostors will be suffocatedperhaps you will
die of cyanogen like Morowitch whose jewels I have at last

He went to the door into the hall and stood there with a mocking laugh
I moved to make a rush toward them but Kennedy raised his hand

You will suffocate Poissan hissed again

Just then we heard the elevator door clang and hurried steps came down
the long hall

Craig whipped out his automatic and began pumping the bullets out in
rapid succession As the smoke cleared I expected to see Poissan and
Francois lying on the floor Instead Craig had fired at the lock of the
door He had shattered it into a thousand bits Andrews and his men were
running down the hall

Curse you muttered Poissan as he banged the now useless lock who
let those fellows in Are you a wizard

Craig smiled coolly as the ventilation cleared the room of the deadly
cyanogen

On the windowsill outside is a selenium cell Selenium is a bad
conductor of electricity in the dark and an excellent conductor when
exposed to light I merely moved my coat and hat and the light from the
furnace which was going to suffocate us played through the glass on the
cell the circuit was completed without your suspecting that I could
communicate with friends outside a bell was rung on the street and
here they are Andrews there is the murderer of Morowitch and there in
his hands are the Morowitch

Poissan had moved toward the furnace With a quick motion he seized the
long tongs There was a cloud of choking vapour Kennedy leaped to
the switch and shut off the current With the tongs he lifted out a
shapeless piece of valueless black graphite

All that is left of the priceless Morowitch jewels he exclaimed
ruefully But we have the murderer

And tomorrow a certified check for one hundred thousand dollars
goes to Mrs Morowitch with my humblest apologies and sympathy added
Andrews Professor Kennedy you have earned your retainer




VII The Azure Ring

Files of newspapers and innumerable clippings from the press bureaus
littered Kennedys desk in rank profusion Kennedy himself was so
deeply absorbed that I had merely said good evening as I came in and had
started to open my mail With an impatient sweep of his hand however
he brushed the whole mass of newspapers into the wastebasket

It seems to me Walter he exclaimed in disgust that this mystery
is considered insoluble for the very reason which should make it easy to
solvethe extraordinary character of its features

Inasmuch as he had opened the subject I laid down the letter I was
reading Ill wager I can tell you just why you made that remark
Craig I ventured Youre reading up on that WainwrightTempleton
affair

You are on the road to becoming a detective yourself Walter he
answered with a touch of sarcasm Your ability to add two units to
two other units and obtain four units is almost worthy of Inspector
OConnor You are right and within a quarter of an hour the district
attorney of Westchester County will be here He telephoned me this
afternoon and sent an assistant with this mass of dope I suppose hell
want it back he added fishing the newspapers out of the basket again
But with all due respect to your profession Ill say that no one
would ever get on speaking terms with the solution of this case if he
had to depend solely on the newspaper writers

No I queried rather nettled at his tone

No he repeated emphatically Here one of the most popular girls
in the fashionable suburb of Williston and one of the leading younger
members of the bar in New York engaged to be married are found dead in
the library of the girls home the day before the ceremony And now
a week later no one knows whether it was an accident due to the fumes
from the antique charcoalbrazier or whether it was a double suicide
or suicide and murder or a double murder ororwhy the experts
havent even been able to agree on whether they have discovered poison
or not he continued growing as excited as the city editor did over my
first attempt as a cub reporter

They havent agreed on anything except that on the eve of what was
presumably to have been the happiest day of their lives two of the best
known members of the younger set are found dead while absolutely no
one as far as is known can be proved to have been near them within the
time necessary to murder them No wonder the coroner says it is simply
a case of asphyxiation No wonder the district attorney is at his wits
end You fellows have hounded them with your hypotheses until they cant
see the facts straight You suggest one solution and before

The doorbell sounded insistently and without waiting for an answer a
tall spare loosejointed individual stalked in and laid a green bag on
the table

Good evening Professor Kennedy he began brusquely I am District
Attorney Whitney of Westchester I see you have been reading up on the
case Quite right

Quite wrong answered Craig Let me introduce my friend Mr Jameson
of the Star Sit down Jameson knows what I think of the way the
newspapers have handled this case I was about to tell him as you came
in that I intended to disregard everything that had been printed to
start out with you as if it were a fresh subject and get the facts at
first hand Lets get right down to business First tell us just how it
was that Miss Wainwright and Mr Templeton were discovered and by whom

The district attorney loosened the cords of the green bag and drew out a
bundle of documents Ill read you the affidavit of the maid who
found them he said fingering the documents nervously You see John
Templeton had left his office in New York early that afternoon telling
his father that he was going to visit Miss Wainwright He caught
the threetwenty train reached Williston all right walked to the
Wainwright house and in spite of the bustle of preparation for the
wedding the next day he spent the rest of the afternoon with Miss
Wainwright Thats where the mystery begins They had no visitors At
least the maid who answers the bell says they had none She was busy
with the rest of the family and I believe the front door was not
lockedwe dont lock our doors in Williston except at night

He had found the paper and paused to impress these facts on our minds

Mrs Wainwright and Miss Marian Wainwright the sister were busy about
the house Mrs Wainwright wished to consult Laura about something She
summoned the maid and asked if Mr Templeton and Miss Wainwright were
in the house The maid replied that she would see and this is her
affidavit Ahem Ill skip the legal part I knocked at the library
door twice but obtaining no answer I supposed they had gone out for
a walk or perhaps a ride across country as they often did I opened the
door partly and looked in There was a silence in the room a strange
queer silence I opened the door further and looking toward the
davenport in the corner I saw Miss Laura and Mr Templeton in such an
awkward position They looked as if they had fallen asleep His head was
thrown back against the cushions of the davenport and on his face was a
most awful look It was discoloured Her head had fallen forward on his
shoulder sideways and on her face too was the same terrible stare
and the same discolouration Their right hands were tightly clasped

I called to them They did not answer Then the horrible truth flashed
on me They were dead I felt giddy for a minute but quickly recovered
myself and with a cry for help I rushed to Mrs Wainwrights room
shrieking that they were dead Mrs Wainwright fainted Miss Marian
called the doctor on the telephone and helped us restore her mother She
seemed perfectly cool in the tragedy and I do not know what we servants
should have done if she had not been there to direct us The house was
frantic and Mr Wainwright was not at home

I did not detect any odour when I opened the library door No glasses
or bottles or vials or other receptacles which could have held poison
were discovered or removed by me or to the best of my knowledge and
belief by anyone else

What happened next asked Craig eagerly

The family physician arrived and sent for the coroner immediately and
later for myself You see he thought at once of murder

But the coroner I understand thinks differently prompted Kennedy

Yes the coroner has declared the case to be accidental He says that
the weight of evidence points positively to asphyxiation Still how can
it be asphyxiation They could have escaped from the room at any time
the door was not locked I tell you in spite of the fact that the tests
for poison in their mouths stomachs and blood have so far revealed
nothing I still believe that John Templeton and Laura Wainwright were
murdered

Kennedy looked at his watch thoughtfully You have told me just enough
to make me want to see the coroner himself he mused If we take
the next train out to Williston with you will you engage to get us a
halfhour talk with him on the case Mr Whitney

Surely But well have to start right away Ive finished my other
business in New York Inspector OConnorah I see you know himhas
promised to secure the attendance of anyone whom I can show to be a
material witness in the case Come on gentlemen Ill answer your other
questions on the train

As we settled ourselves in the smoker Whitney remarked in a low voice
You know someone has said that there is only one thing more difficult
to investigate and solve than a crime whose commission is surrounded
by complicated circumstances and that is a crime whose perpetration is
wholly devoid of circumstances

Are you so sure that this crime is wholly devoid of circumstances
asked Craig

Professor he replied Im not sure of anything in this case If I
were I should not require your assistance I would like the credit of
solving it myself but it is beyond me Just think of it so far we
havent a clue at least none that shows the slightest promise although
we have worked night and day for a week Its all darkness The facts
are so simple that they give us nothing to work on It is like a blank
sheet of paper

Kennedy said nothing and the district attorney proceeded I dont
blame Mr Nott the coroner for thinking it an accident But to
my mind some master criminal must have arranged this very baffling
simplicity of circumstances You recall that the front door was
unlocked This person must have entered the house unobserved not a
difficult thing to do for the Wainwright house is somewhat isolated
Perhaps this person brought along some poison in the form of a beverage
and induced the two victims to drink And then this person must have
removed the evidences as swiftly as they were brought in and by the same
door That I think is the only solution

That is not the only solution It is one solution interrupted Kennedy
quietly

Do you think someone in the house did it I asked quickly

I think replied Craig carefully measuring his words that if poison
was given them it must have been by someone they both knew pretty well

No one said a word until at last I broke the silence I know from the
gossip of the Star office that many Williston people say that Marian was
very jealous of her sister Laura for capturing the catch of the season
Williston people dont hesitate to hint at it

Whitney produced another document from that fertile green bag It was
another affidavit He handed it to us It was a statement signed by Mrs
Wainwright and read

Before God my daughter Marian is innocent If you wish to find out
all find out more about the past history of Mr Templeton before he
became engaged to Laura She would never in the world have committed
suicide She was too bright and cheerful for that even if Mr Templeton
had been about to break off the engagement My daughters Laura and
Marian were always treated by Mr Wainwright and myself exactly alike
Of course they had their quarrels just as all sisters do but there was
never to my certain knowledge a serious disagreement and I was always
close enough to my girls to know No Laura was murdered by someone
outside

Kennedy did not seem to attach much importance to this statement Let
us see he began reflectively First we have a young woman especially
attractive and charming in both person and temperament She is just
about to be married and if the reports are to be believed there was
no cloud on her happiness Secondly we have a young man whom everyone
agrees to have been of an ardent energetic optimistic temperament He
had everything to live for presumably So far so good Everyone who
has investigated this case I understand has tried to eliminate the
doublesuicide and the suicideandmurder theories That is all
right providing the facts are as stated We shall see later when we
interview the coroner Now Mr Whitney suppose you tell us briefly
what you have learned about the past history of the two unfortunate
lovers

Well the Wainwrights are an old Westchester family not very wealthy
but of the real aristocracy of the county There were only two children
Laura and Marian The Templetons were much the same sort of family The
children all attended a private school at White Plains and there also
they met Schuyler Vanderdyke These four constituted a sort of little
aristocracy in the school I mention this because Vanderdyke later
became Lauras first husband This marriage with Templeton was a second
venture

How long ago was she divorced asked Craig attentively

About three years ago Im coming to that in a moment The sisters went
to college together Templeton to law school and Vanderdyke studied
civil engineering Their intimacy was pretty well broken up all except
Lauras and Vanderdykes Soon after he graduated he was taken into the
construction department of the Central Railroad by his uncle who was a
vicepresident and Laura and he were married As far as I can learn he
had been a fellow of convivial habits at college and about two years
after their marriage his wife suddenly became aware of what had
long been well known in Williston that Vanderdyke was paying marked
attention to a woman named Miss Laporte in New York

No sooner had Laura Vanderdyke learned of this intimacy of her
husband continued Whitney than she quietly hired private detectives
to shadow him and on their evidence she obtained a divorce The papers
were sealed and she resumed her maiden name

As far as I can find out Vanderdyke then disappeared from her life He
resigned his position with the railroad and joined a party of engineers
exploring the upper Amazon Later he went to Venezuela Miss Laporte
also went to South America about the same time and was for a time in
Venezuela and later in Peru

Vanderdyke seems to have dropped all his early associations completely
though at present I find he is back in New York raising capital for
a company to exploit a new asphalt concession in the interior of
Venezuela Miss Laporte has also reappeared in New York as Mrs Ralston
with a mining claim in the mountains of Peru

And Templeton asked Craig Had he had any previous matrimonial
ventures

No none Of course he had had love affairs mostly with the
countryclub set He had known Miss Laporte pretty well too while he
was in law school in New York But when he settled down to work he seems
to have forgotten all about the girls for a couple of years or so He
was very anxious to get ahead and let nothing stand in his way He was
admitted to the bar and taken in by his father as junior member of the
firm of Templeton Mills  Templeton Not long ago he was appointed
a special master to take testimony in the getrichquickcompany
prosecutions and I happen to know that he was making good in the
investigation

Kennedy nodded What sort of fellow personally was Templeton he
asked

Very popular replied the district attorney both at the country
club and in his profession in New York He was a fellow of naturally
commanding temperamentthe Templetons were always that way I doubt if
many young men even with his chances could have gained such a reputation
at thirtyfive as his Socially he was very popular too a great
catch for all the sly mamas of the country club who had marriageable
daughters He liked automobiles and outdoor sports and he was strong in
politics too That was how he got ahead so fast

Well to cut the story short Templeton met the Wainwright girls again
last summer at a resort on Long Island They had just returned from a
long trip abroad spending most of the time in the Far East with their
father whose firm has business interests in China The girls were very
attractive They rode and played tennis and golf better than most of the
men and this fall Templeton became a frequent visitor at the Wainwright
home in Williston

People who know them best tell me that his first attentions were paid
to Marian a very dashing and ambitious young woman Nearly every day
Templetons car stopped at the house and the girls and some friend of
Templetons in the country club went for a ride They tell me that at
this time Marian always sat with Templeton on the front seat But
after a few weeks the gossipsnothing of that sort ever escapes
Willistonsaid that the occupant of the front seat was Laura She often
drove the car herself and was very clever at it At any rate not long
after that the engagement was announced

As he walked up from the pretty little Williston station Kennedy asked
One more question Mr Whitney How did Marian take the engagement

The district attorney hesitated I will be perfectly frank Mr
Kennedy he answered The countryclub people tell me that the girls
were very cool toward each other That was why I got that statement from
Mrs Wainwright I wish to be perfectly fair to everyone concerned in
this case

We found the coroner quite willing to talk in spite of the fact that
the hour was late My friend Mr Whitney here still holds the poison
theory began the coroner in spite of the fact that everything points
absolutely toward asphyxiation If I had been able to discover the
slightest trace of illuminatinggas in the room I should have pronounced
it asphyxia at once All the symptoms accorded with it But the asphyxia
was not caused by escaping illuminatinggas

There was an antique charcoalbrazier in the room and I have
ascertained that it was lighted Now anything like a brazier will
unless there is proper ventilation give rise to carbonic oxide
or carbon monoxide gas which is always present in the products of
combustion often to the extent of from five to ten per cent A very
slight quantity of this gas insufficient even to cause an odour in a
room will give a severe headache and a case is recorded where a whole
family in Glasgow was poisoned without knowing it by the escape of this
gas A little over one per cent of it in the atmosphere is fatal
if breathed for any length of time You know it is a product of
combustion and is very deadlyit is the muchdreaded white damp or
afterdamp of a mine explosion

Im going to tell you a secret which I have not given out to the press
yet I tried an experiment in a closed room today lighting the brazier
Some distance from it I placed a cat confined in a cage so it could not
escape In an hour and a half the cat was asphyxiated

The coroner concluded with an air of triumph that quite squelched the
district attorney

Kennedy was all attention Have you preserved samples of the blood of
Mr Templeton and Miss Wainwright he asked

Certainly I have them in my office

The coroner who was also a local physician led us back into his
private office

And the cat added Craig

Doctor Nott produced it in a covered basket

Quickly Kennedy drew off a little of the blood of the cat and held it up
to the light along with the human samples The difference was apparent

You see he explained carbon monoxide combines firmly with the
blood destroying the red colouring matter of the red corpuscles No
Doctor Im afraid it wasnt carbonic oxide that killed the lovers
although it certainly killed the cat

Doctor Nott was crestfallen but still unconvinced If my whole medical
reputation were at stake he repeated I should still be compelled to
swear to asphyxia Ive seen it too often to make a mistake Carbonic
oxide or not Templeton and Miss Wainwright were asphyxiated

It was now Whitneys chance to air his theory

I have always inclined toward the cyanideofpotassium theory either
that it was administered in a drink or perhaps injected by a needle he
said One of the chemists has reported that there was a possibility of
slight traces of cyanide in the mouths

If it had been cyanide replied Craig looking reflectively at the two
jars before him on the table these blood specimens would be blue in
colour and clotted But they are not Then too there is a substance
in the saliva which is used in the process of digestion It gives a
reaction which might very easily be mistaken for a slight trace of
cyanide I think that explains what the chemist discovered no more no
less The cyanide theory does not fit

One chemist hinted at nux vomica volunteered the coroner He said
it wasnt nux vomica but that the blood test showed something very
much like it Oh weve looked for morphine chloroform ether all the
ordinary poisons besides some of the little known alkaloids Believe
me Professor Kennedy it was asphyxia

I could tell by the look that crossed Kennedys face that at last a ray
of light had pierced the darkness Have you any spirits of turpentine
in the office he asked

The coroner shook his head and took a step toward the telephone as if to
call the drugstore in town

Or ether interrupted Craig Ether will do

Oh yes plenty of ether

Craig poured a little of one of the blood samples from the jar into a
tube and added a few drops of ether A cloudy dark precipitate formed
He smiled quietly and said half to himself I thought so

What is it asked the coroner eagerly Nux vomica

Craig shook his head as he stared at the black precipitate You were
perfectly right about the asphyxiation Doctor he remarked
slowly but wrong as to the cause It wasnt carbon monoxide or
illuminatinggas And you Mr Whitney were right about the poison
too Only it is a poison neither of you ever heard of

What is it we asked simultaneously

Let me take these samples and make some further tests I am sure of
it but it is new to me Wait till tomorrow night when my chain of
evidence is completed Then you are all cordially invited to attend
at my laboratory at the university Ill ask you Mr Whitney to
come armed with a warrant for John or Jane Doe Please see that the
Wainwrights particularly Marian are present You can tell Inspector
OConnor that Mr Vanderdyke and Mrs Ralston are required as material
witnessesanything so long as you are sure that these five persons are
present Good night gentlemen

We rode back to the city in silence but as we neared the station
Kennedy remarked You see Walter these people are like the
newspapers They are floundering around in a sea of unrelated facts
There is more than they think back of this crime Ive been revolving
in my mind how it will be possible to get some inkling about this
concession of Vanderdykes the mining claim of Mrs Ralston and the
exact itinerary of the Wainwright trip in the Far East Do you think
you can get that information for me I think it will take me all day
tomorrow to isolate this poison and get things in convincing shape on
that score Meanwhile if you can see Vanderdyke and Mrs Ralston you
can help me a great deal I am sure you will find them very interesting
people

I have been told that she is quite a female high financier I replied
tacitly accepting Craigs commission Her story is that her claim is
situated near the mine of a group of powerful American capitalists who
are opposed to having any competition and on the strength of that
story she has been raking in the money right and left I dont know
Vanderdyke never heard of him before but no doubt he has some equally
interesting game

Dont let them think you connect them with the case however
cautioned Craig

Early the next morning I started out on my quest for facts though not
so early but that Kennedy had preceded me to his work in his laboratory
It was not very difficult to get Mrs Ralston to talk about her troubles
with the government In fact I did not even have to broach the subject
of the death of Templeton She volunteered the information that in his
handling of her case he had been very unjust to her in spite of the
fact that she had known him well a long time ago She even hinted that
she believed he represented the combination of capitalists who
were using the government to aid their own monopoly and prevent the
development of her mine Whether it was an obsession of her mind
or merely part of her clever scheme I could not make out I noted
however that when she spoke of Templeton it was in a studied
impersonal way and that she was at pains to lay the blame for the
governmental interference rather on the rival mineowners

It quite surprised me when I found from the directory that Vanderdykes
office was on the floor below in the same building Like Mrs Ralstons
it was open but not doing business pending the investigation by the
PostOffice Department

Vanderdyke was a type of which I had seen many before Well dressed to
the extreme he displayed all those evidences of prosperity which are
the stock in trade of the man with securities to sell He grasped
my hand when I told him I was going to present the other side of the
postoffice cases and held it between both of his as if he had known me
all his life Only the fact that he had never seen me before prevented
his calling me by my first name I took mental note of his stock of
jewellery the pin in his tie that might almost have been the Hope
diamond the heavy watch chain across his chest and a very brilliant
seal ring of lapis lazuli on the hand that grasped mine He saw me
looking at it and smiled

My dear fellow we have deposits of that stuff that would make a
fortune if we could get the machinery to get at it Why sir there is
lapis lazuli enough on our claim to make enough ultramarine paint to
supply all the artists to the end of the world Actually we could afford
to crush it up and sell it as paint And that is merely incidental to
the other things on the concession The asphalts the thing Thats
where the big money is When we get started sir the old asphalt trust
will simply melt away melt away

He blew a cloud of tobacco smoke and let it dissolve significantly in
the air

When it came to talking about the suits however Vanderdyke was not
so communicative as Mrs Ralston but he was also not so bitter against
either the postoffice or Templeton

Poor Templeton he said I used to know him years ago when we were
boys Went to school with him and all that sort of thing you know
but until I ran across him or rather he ran across me in this
investigation I hadnt heard much about him Pretty clever fellow he
was too The state will miss him but my lawyer tells me that we
should have won the suit anyhow even if that unfortunate tragedy hadnt
occurred Most unaccountable wasnt it Ive read about it in the
papers for old times sake and can make nothing out of it

I said nothing but wondered how he could pass so lightheartedly over
the death of the woman who had once been his wife However I said
nothing The result was he launched forth again on the riches of his
Venezuelan concession and loaded me down with literature which I
crammed into my pocket for future reference

My next step was to drop into the office of a SpanishAmerica paper
whose editor was especially well informed on South American affairs

Do I know Mrs Ralston he repeated thoughtfully lighting one of
those black cigarettes that look so vicious and are so mild I should
say so Ill tell you a little story about her Three or four years
ago she turned up in Caracas I dont know who Mr Ralston wasperhaps
there never was any Mr Ralston Anyhow she got in with the official
circle of the Castro government and was very successful as an
adventuress She has considerable business ability and represented
a certain group of Americans But if you recall when Castro was
eliminated pretty nearly everyone who had stood high with him went too
It seems that a number of the old concessionaires played the game on
both sides This particular group had a man named Vanderdyke on the
antiCastro side So when Mrs Ralston went she just quietly sailed by
way of Panama to the other side of the continent to Peruthey paid her
welland Vanderdyke took the title role

Oh yes she and Vanderdyke were very good friends very indeed I
think they must have known each other here in the States Still they
played their parts well at the time Since things have settled down in
Venezuela the concessionaires have found no further use for Vanderdyke
either and here they are Vanderdyke and Mrs Ralston both in New York
now with two of the most outrageous schemes of financing ever seen on
Broad Street They have offices in the same building they are together
a great deal and now I hear that the state attorneygeneral is after
both of them

With this information and a very meagre report of the Wainwright trip to
the Far East which had taken in some outoftheway places apparently
I hastened back to Kennedy He was surrounded by bottles tubes jars
retorts Bunsen burners everything in the science and art of chemistry
I thought

I didnt like the way he looked His hand was unsteady and his eyes
looked badly but he seemed quite put out when I suggested that he was
working too hard over the case I was worried about him but rather than
say anything to offend him I left him for the rest of the afternoon
only dropping in before dinner to make sure that he would not forget to
eat something He was then completing his preparations for the evening
They were of the simplest kind apparently In fact all I could see was
an apparatus which consisted of a rubber funnel inverted and attached
to a rubber tube which led in turn into a jar about a quarter full of
water Through the stopper of the jar another tube led to a tank of
oxygen

There were several jars of various liquids on the table and a number
of chemicals Among other things was a sort of gourd encrusted with a
black substance and in a corner was a box from which sounds issued as
if it contained something alive

I did not trouble Kennedy with questions for I was only too glad when
he consented to take a brisk walk and join me in a thick porterhouse

It was a large party that gathered in Kennedys laboratory that night
one of the largest he had ever had Mr and Mrs Wainwright and Miss
Marian came the ladies heavily veiled Doctor Nott and Mr Whitney were
among the first to arrive Later came Mr Vanderdyke and last of all
Mrs Ralston with Inspector OConnor Altogether it was an unwilling
party

I shall begin said Kennedy by going over briefly the facts in
this case

Tersely he summarised it to my surprise laying great stress on the
proof that the couple had been asphyxiated

But it was no ordinary asphyxiation he continued We have to deal in
this case with a poison which is apparently among the most subtle known
A particle of matter so minute as to be hardly distinguishable by the
naked eye on the point of a needle or a lancet a prick of the skin
scarcely felt under any circumstances and which would pass quite
unheeded if the attention were otherwise engaged and not all the power
in the worldunless one was fully preparedcould save the life of the
person in whose skin the puncture had been made

Craig paused a moment but no one showed any evidence of being more than
ordinarily impressed

This poison I find acts on the socalled endplates of the muscles and
nerves It produces complete paralysis but not loss of consciousness
sensation circulation or respiration until the end approaches It
seems to be one of the most powerful sedatives I have ever heard of
When introduced in even a minute quantity it produces death finally by
asphyxiationby paralysing the muscles of respiration This asphyxia is
what so puzzled the coroner

I will now inject a little of the blood serum of the victims into a
white mouse

He took a mouse from the box I had seen and with a needle injected the
serum The mouse did not even wince so lightly did he touch it but as
we watched its life seemed gently to ebb away without pain and without
struggle Its breath simply seemed to stop

Next he took the gourd I had seen on the table and with a knife scraped
off just the minutest particle of the black licoricelike stuff that
encrusted it He dissolved the particle in some alcohol and with a
sterilised needle repeated his experiment on a second mouse The effect
was precisely similar to that produced by the blood on the first

It did not seem to me that anyone showed any emotion except possibly
the slight exclamation that escaped Miss Marian Wainwright I fell
to wondering whether it was prompted by a soft heart or a guilty
conscience

We were all intent on what Craig was doing especially Doctor Nott who
now broke in with a question

Professor Kennedy may I ask a question Admitting that the first mouse
died in an apparently similar manner to the second what proof have you
that the poison is the same in both cases And if it is the same can you
show that it affects human beings in the same way and that enough of
it has been discovered in the blood of the victims to have caused their
death In other words I want the last doubt set aside How do you know
absolutely that this poison which you discovered in my office last night
in that black precipitate when you added the etherhow do you know that
it asphyxiated the victims

If ever Craig startled me it was by his quiet reply Ive isolated
it in their blood extracted it sterilised it and Ive tried it on
myself

In breathless amazement with eyes riveted on Craig we listened

Altogether I was able to recover from the blood samples of both of
the victims of this crime six centigrams of the poison he pursued
Starting with two centigrams of it as a moderate dose I injected it
into my right arm subcutaneously Then I slowly worked my way up
to three and then four centigrams They did not produce any very
appreciable results other than to cause some dizziness slight vertigo
a considerable degree of lassitude and an extremely painful headache
of rather unusual duration But five centigrams considerably improved
on this It caused a degree of vertigo and lassitude that was most
distressing and six centigrams the whole amount which I had recovered
from the samples of blood gave me the fright of my life right here in
this laboratory this afternoon

Perhaps I was not wise in giving myself so large an injection on a day
when I was overheated and below par otherwise because of the strain I
have been under in handling this case However that may be the added
centigram produced so much more on top of the five centigrams previously
taken that for a time I had reason to fear that that additional
centigram was just the amount needed to bring my experiments to a
permanent close

Within three minutes of the time of injection the dizziness and vertigo
had become so great as to make walking seem impossible In another
minute the lassitude rapidly crept over me and the serious disturbance
of my breathing made it apparent to me that walking waving my arms
anything was imperative My lungs felt glued up and the muscles of my
chest refused to work Everything swam before my eyes and I was soon
reduced to walking up and down the laboratory with halting steps only
preventing falling on the floor by holding fast to the edge of this
table It seemed to me that I spent hours gasping for breath It
reminded me of what I once experienced in the Cave of the Winds of
Niagara where water is more abundant in the atmosphere than air My
watch afterward indicated only about twenty minutes of extreme distress
but that twenty minutes is one never to be forgotten and I advise you
all if you ever are so foolish as to try the experiment to remain
below the fivecentigram limit

How much was administered to the victims Doctor Nott I cannot say
but it must have been a good deal more than I took Six centigrams
which I recovered from these small samples are only ninetenths of
a grain Yet you see what effect it had I trust that answers your
question

Doctor Nott was too overwhelmed to reply

And what is this deadly poison continued Craig anticipating our
thoughts I have been fortunate enough to obtain a sample of it from
the Museum of Natural History It comes in a little gourd or often a
calabash This is in a gourd It is blackish brittle stuff encrusting
the sides of the gourd just as if it was poured in in the liquid state
and left to dry Indeed that is just what has been done by those who
manufacture this stuff after a lengthy and somewhat secret process

He placed the gourd on the edge of the table where we could all see it
I was almost afraid even to look at it

The famous traveller Sir Robert Schomburgh first brought it into
Europe and Darwin has described it It is now an article of commerce
and is to be found in the United States Pharmacopoeia as a medicine
though of course it is used in only very minute quantities as a heart
stimulant

Craig opened a book to a place he had marked

At least one person in this room will appreciate the local colour of a
little incident I am going to readto illustrate what death from this
poison is like Two natives of the part of the world whence it comes
were one day hunting They were armed with blowpipes and quivers full
of poisoned darts made of thin charred pieces of bamboo tipped with this
stuff One of them aimed a dart It missed the object overhead glanced
off the tree and fell down on the hunter himself This is how the other
native reported the result

Quacca takes the dart out of his shoulder Never a word Puts it in
his quiver and throws it in the stream Gives me his blowpipe for his
little son Says to me goodbye for his wife and the village Then he
lies down His tongue talks no longer No sight in his eyes He folds
his arms He rolls over slowly His mouth moves without sound I feel
his heart It goes fast and then slow It stops Quacca has shot his
last woorali dart

We looked at each other and the horror of the thing sank deep into our
minds Woorali What was it There were many travellers in the room who
had been in the Orient home of poisons and in South America Which one
had run across the poison

Woorali or curare said Craig slowly is the wellknown poison with
which the South American Indians of the upper Orinoco tip their arrows
Its principal ingredient is derived from the Strychnos toxifera tree
which yields also the drug nux vomica

A great light dawned on me I turned quickly to where Vanderdyke was
sitting next to Mrs Ralston and a little behind her His stony stare
and laboured breathing told me that he had read the purport of Kennedys
actions

For Gods sake Craig I gasped An emetic quickVanderdyke

A trace of a smile flitted over Vanderdykes features as much as to say
that he was beyond our interference

Vanderdyke said Craig with what seemed to me a brutal calmness
then it was you who were the visitor who last saw Laura Wainwright and
John Templeton alive Whether you shot a dart at them I do not know But
you are the murderer

Vanderdyke raised his hand as if to assent It fell back limp and I
noted the ring of the bluest lapis lazuli

Mrs Ralston threw herself toward him Will you not do something Is
there no antidote Dont let him die she cried

You are the murderer repeated Kennedy as if demanding a final
answer

Again the hand moved in confession and he feebly moved the finger on
which shone the ring

Our attention was centred on Vanderdyke Mrs Ralston unobserved went
to the table and picked up the gourd Before OConnor could stop her
she had rubbed her tongue on the black substance inside It was only a
little bit for OConnor quickly dashed it from her lips and threw the
gourd through the window smashing the glass

Kennedy he shouted frantically Mrs Ralston has swallowed some of
it

Kennedy seemed so intent on Vanderdyke that I had to repeat the remark

Without looking up he said Oh one can swallow itits strange
but it is comparatively inert if swallowed even in a pretty goodsized
quantity I doubt if Mrs Ralston ever heard of it before except by
hearsay If she had shed have scratched herself with it instead of
swallowing it

If Craig had been indifferent to the emergency of Vanderdyke before
he was all action now that the confession had been made In an instant
Vanderdyke was stretched on the floor and Craig had taken out the
apparatus I had seen during the afternoon

I am prepared for this he exclaimed quickly Here is the apparatus
for artificial respiration Nott hold that rubber funnel over his nose
and start the oxygen from the tank Pull his tongue forward so it wont
fall down his throat and choke him Ill work his arms Walter make a
tourniquet of your handkerchief and put it tightly on the muscles of
his left arm That may keep some of the poison in his arm from spreading
into the rest of his body This is the only antidote knownartificial
respiration

Kennedy was working feverishly going through the motions of first
aid to a drowned man Mrs Ralston was on her knees beside Vanderdyke
kissing his hands and forehead whenever Kennedy stopped for a minute
and crying softly

Schuyler poor boy I wonder how you could have done it I was with him
that day We rode up in his car and as we passed through Williston he
said he would stop a minute and wish Templeton luck I didnt think it
strange for he said he had nothing any longer against Laura Wainwright
and Templeton only did his duty as a lawyer against us I forgave John
for prosecuting us but Schuyler didnt after all Oh my poor boy why
did you do it We could have gone somewhere else and started all over
againit wouldnt have been the first time

At last came the flutter of an eyelid and a voluntary breath or two
Vanderdyke seemed to realise where he was With a last supreme effort he
raised his hand and drew it slowly across his face Then he fell back
exhausted by the effort

But he had at last put himself beyond the reach of the law There was no
tourniquet that would confine the poison now in the scratch across his
face Back of those lacklustre eyes he heard and knew but could not
move or speak His voice was gone his limbs his face his chest
and last his eyes I wondered if it were possible to conceive a more
dreadful torture than that endured by a mind which so witnessed the
dying of one organ after another of its own body shut up as it were
in the fulness of life within a corpse

I looked in bewilderment at the scratch on his face How did he do it
I asked

Carefully Craig drew off the azure ring and examined it In that part
which surrounded the blue lapis lazuli he indicated a hollow point
concealed It worked with a spring and communicated with a little
receptacle behind in such a way that the murderer could give the fatal
scratch while shaking hands with his victim

I shuddered for my hand had once been clasped by the one wearing
that poison ring which had sent Templeton and his fiancee and now
Vanderdyke himself to their deaths




VIII Spontaneous Combustion

Kennedy and I had risen early for we were hustling to get off for a
weekend at Atlantic City Kennedy was tugging at the straps of his grip
and remonstrating with it under his breath when the door opened and a
messengerboy stuck his head in

Does Mr Kennedy live here he asked

Craig impatiently seized the pencil signed his name in the book and
tore open a night letter From the prolonged silence that followed I
felt a sense of misgiving I at least had set my heart on the Atlantic
City outing but with the appearance of the messengerboy I intuitively
felt that the board walk would not see us that week

Im afraid the Atlantic City trip is off Walter remarked Craig
seriously You remember Tom Langley in our class at the university
Well read that

I laid down my safety razor and took the message Tom had not spared
words and I could see at a glance at the mere length of the thing that
it must be important It was from Camp Hangout in the Adirondacks

Dear old K it began regardless of expense can you arrange to come
up here by next train after you receive this Uncle Lewis is dead Most
mysterious Last night after we retired noticed peculiar odour about
house Didnt pay much attention This morning found him lying on floor
of livingroom head and chest literally burned to ashes but lower part
of body and arms untouched Room shows no evidence of fire but full of
sort of oily soot Otherwise nothing unusual On table near body siphon
of seltzer bottle of imported limes and glass for rickeys Have
removed body but am keeping room exactly as found until you arrive
Bring Jameson Wire if you cannot come but make every effort and spare
no expense Anxiously Tom Langley

Craig was impatiently looking at his watch as I hastily ran through the
letter

Hurry Walter he exclaimed We can just catch the Empire State
Never mind shavingwell have a stopover at Utica to wait for the
Montreal express Here put the rest of your things in your grip and
jam it shut Well get something to eat on the trainI hope Ill wire
were coming Dont forget to latch the door

Kennedy was already halfway to the elevator and I followed ruefully
still thinking of the ocean and the piers the bands and the roller
chairs

It was a good tenhour journey up to the little station nearest Camp
Hangout and at least a two hour ride after that We had plenty of time
to reflect over what this death might mean to Tom and his sister and to
speculate on the manner of it Tom and Grace Langley were relatives by
marriage of Lewis Langley who after the death of his wife had made
them his proteges Lewis Langley was principally noted as far as I
could recall for being a member of some of the fastest clubs of both
New York and London Neither Kennedy nor myself had shared in the
worlds opinion of him for we knew how good he had been to Tom in
college and from Tom how good he had been to Grace In fact he had
made Tom assume the Langley name and in every way had treated the
brother and sister as if they had been his own children

Tom met us with a smart trap at the station a sufficient indication
if we had not already known of the roughing it at such a luxurious
Adirondack camp as Camp Hangout He was unaffectedly glad to see us
and it was not difficult to read in his face the worry which the affair
had already given him

Tom Im awfully sorry to began Craig when warned by Langleys
look at the curious crowd that always gathers at the railroad station
at train time he cut it short We stood silently a moment while Tom was
arranging the trap for us

As we swung around the bend in the road that cut off the little station
and its crowd of lookerson Kennedy was the first to speak Tom he
said first of all let me ask that when we get to the camp we are
to be simply two old classmates whom you had asked to spend a few days
before the tragedy occurred Anything will do There may be nothing at
all to your evident suspicions and then again there may At any
rate play the game safelydont arouse any feeling which might cause
unpleasantness later in case you are mistaken

I quite agree with you answered Tom You wired from Albany I
think to keep the facts out of the papers as much as possible Im
afraid it is too late for that Of course the thing became vaguely known
in Saranac although the county officers have been very considerate of
us and this morning a New York Record correspondent was over and talked
with us I couldnt refuse that would have put a very bad face on it

Too bad I exclaimed I had hoped at least to be able to keep the
report down to a few lines in the Star But the Record will have such
a yellow story about it that Ill simply have to do something to
counteract the effect

Yes assented Craig Butwait Lets see the Record story first The
office doesnt know youre up here You can hold up the Star and give
us time to look things over perhaps get in a beat on the real story and
set things right Anyhow the news is out Thats certain We must work
quickly Tell me Tom who are at the campanyone except relatives

No he replied guardedly measuring his words Uncle Lewis had
invited his brother James and his niece and nephew Isabelle and James
juniorwe call him Junior Then there are Grace and myself and
a distant relative Harrington Brown andoh of course uncles
physician Doctor Putnam

Who is Harrington Brown asked Craig

Hes on the other side of the Langley family on Uncle Lewiss mothers
side I think or at least Grace thinks that he is quite in love with
Isabelle Harrington Brown would be quite a catch Of course he isnt
wealthy but his family is mighty well connected Oh Craig sighed
Langley I wish he hadnt done itUncle Lewis I mean Why did he
invite his brother up here now when he needed to recover from the swift
pace of last winter in New York You knowor you dont know I suppose
but youll know it nowwhen he and Uncle Jim got together there was
nothing to it but one drink after another Doctor Putnam was quite
disgusted at least he professed to be but Craig he lowered his
voice to a whisper as if the very forest had ears theyre all
aliketheyve been just waiting for Uncle Lewis to drink himself to
death Oh he added bitterly theres no love lost between me and the
relatives on that score I can assure you

How did you find him that morning asked Kennedy as if to turn off
this unlocking of family secrets to strangers

Thats the worst part of the whole affair replied Tom and even in
the dusk I could see the lines of his face tighten You know Uncle
Lewis was a hard drinker but he never seemed to show it much We
had been out on the lake in the motorboat fishing all the afternoon
andwell I must admit both my uncles had had frequent recourse to
pocket pistols and I remember they referred to it each time as
bait Then after supper nothing would do but fizzes and rickeys I was
disgusted and after reading a bit went to bed Harrington and my uncles
sat up with Doctor Putnamaccording to Uncle Jimfor a couple of
hours longer Then Harrington Doctor Putnam and Uncle Jim went to bed
leaving Uncle Lewis still drinking I remember waking in the night and
the house seemed saturated with a peculiar odour I never smelt anything
like it in my life So I got up and slipped into my bathrobe I met
Grace in the hall She was sniffing

Dont you smell something burning she asked

I said I did and started downstairs to investigate Everything was
dark but that smell was all over the house I looked in each
room downstairs as I went but could see nothing The kitchen and
diningroom were all right I glanced into the livingroom but while
the smell was more noticeable there I could see no evidence of a fire
except the dying embers on the hearth It had been coolish that night
and we had had a few logs blazing I didnt examine the roomthere
seemed no reason for it We went back to our rooms and in the morning
they found the gruesome object I had missed in the darkness and shadows
of the livingroom

Kennedy was intently listening Who found him he asked

Harrington replied Tom He roused us Harringtons theory is that
uncle set himself on fire with a spark from his cigara charred cigar
butt was found on the floor

We found Toms relatives a saddened silent party in the face of the
tragedy Kennedy and I apologised very profusely for our intrusion but
Tom quickly interrupted as we had agreed by explaining that he had
insisted on our coming as old friends on whom he felt he could rely
especially to set the matter right in the newspapers

I think Craig noticed keenly the reticence of the family group in the
mysteryI might almost have called it suspicion They did not seem to
know just whether to take it as an accident or as something worse
and each seemed to entertain a reserve toward the rest which was very
uncomfortable

Mr Langleys attorney in New York had been notified but apparently was
out of town for he had not been heard from They seemed rather anxious
to get word from him

Dinner over the family group separated leaving Tom an opportunity to
take us into the gruesome livingroom Of course the remains had
been removed but otherwise the room was exactly as it had been when
Harrington discovered the tragedy I did not see the body which was
lying in an anteroom but Kennedy did and spent some time in there

After he rejoined us Kennedy next examined the fireplace It was full
of ashes from the logs which had been lighted on the fatal night
He noted attentively the distance of Lewis Langleys chair from the
fireplace and remarked that the varnish on the chair was not even
blistered

Before the chair on the floor where the body had been found he pointed
out to us the peculiar ashmarks for some space around but it really
seemed to me as if something else interested him more than these
ashmarks

We had been engaged perhaps half an hour in viewing the room At last
Craig suddenly stopped

Tom he said I think Ill wait till daylight before I go any
further I cant tell with certainty under these lights though perhaps
they show me some things the sunlight wouldnt show Wed better leave
everything just as it is until morning

So we locked the room again and went into a sort of library across the
hall

We were sitting in silence each occupied with his own thoughts on the
mystery when the telephone rang It proved to be a longdistance call
from New York for Tom himself His uncles attorney had received the
news at his home out on Long Island and had hurried to the city to take
charge of the estate But that was not the news that caused the grave
look on Toms face as he nervously rejoined us

That was uncles lawyer Mr Clark of Clark  Burdick he said
He has opened uncles personal safe in the offices of the Langley
estateyou remember them Craigwhere all the property of the Langley
heirs is administered by the trustees He says he cant find the will
though he knows there was a will and that it was placed in that safe
some time ago There is no duplicate

The full purport of this information at once flashed on me and I was
on the point of blurting out my sympathy when I saw by the look which
Craig and Tom exchanged that they had already realised it and understood
each other Without the will the bloodrelatives would inherit all of
Lewis Langleys interest in the old Langley estate Tom and his sister
would be penniless

It was late yet we sat for nearly an hour longer and I dont think we
exchanged a halfdozen sentences in all that time Craig seemed absorbed
in thought At length as the great hallclock sounded midnight we rose
as if by common consent

Tom said Craig and I could feel the sympathy that welled up in his
voice Tom old man Ill get at the bottom of this mystery if human
intelligence can do it

I know you will Craig responded Tom grasping each of us by the
hand Thats why I so much wanted you fellows to come up here

Early in the morning Kennedy aroused me Now Walter Im going to ask
you to come down into the livingroom with me and well take a look at
it in the daytime

I hurried into my clothes and together we quietly went down Starting
with the exact spot where the unfortunate man had been discovered
Kennedy began a minute examination of the floor using his pocket lens
Every few moments he would stop to examine a spot on the rug or on
the hardwood floor more intently Several times I saw him scrape
up something with the blade of his knife and carefully preserve the
scrapings each in a separate piece of paper

Sitting idly by I could not for the life of me see just what good it
did for me to be there and I said as much Kennedy laughed quietly

Youre a material witness Walter he replied Perhaps I shall need
you some day to testify that I actually found these spots in this room

Just then Tom stuck his head in Can I help he asked Why didnt you
tell me you were going at it so early

No thanks answered Craig rising from the floor I was just making
a careful examination of the room before anyone was up so that nobody
would think I was too interested Ive finished But you can help me
after all Do you think you could describe exactly how everyone was
dressed that night

Why I can try Let me see To begin with uncle had on a
shootingjacketthat was pretty well burnt as you know Why in fact
we all had our shootingjackets on The ladies were in white

Craig pondered a little but did not seem disposed to pursue the subject
further until Tom volunteered the information that since the tragedy
none of them had been wearing their shooting jackets

Weve all been wearing city clothes he remarked

Could you get your Uncle James and your Cousin Junior to go with
you for an hour or two this morning on the lake or on a tramp in the
woods asked Craig after a moments thought

Really Craig responded Tom doubtfully I ought to go to Saranac to
complete the arrangements for taking Uncle Lewiss body to New York

Very well persuade them to go with you Anything so long as you keep
me from interruption for an hour or two

They agreed on doing that and as by that time most of the family were
up we went in to breakfast another silent and suspicious meal

After breakfast Kennedy tactfully withdrew from the family and I did
the same We wandered off in the direction of the stables and there fell
to admiring some of the horses The groom who seemed to be a sensible
and pleasant sort of fellow was quite ready to talk and soon he and
Craig were deep in discussing the game of the north country

Many rabbits about here asked Kennedy at length when they had
exhausted the larger game

Oh yes I saw one this morning sir replied the groom

Indeed said Kennedy Do you suppose you could catch a couple for
me

Guess I could siralive you mean

Oh yes aliveI dont want you to violate the game laws This is the
closed season isnt it

Yes sir but then its all right sir here on the estate

Bring them to me this afternoon orno keep them here in the stable
in a cage and let me know when you have them If anybody asks you about
them say they belong to Mr Tom

Craig handed a small treasury note to the groom who took it with a grin
and touched his hat

Thanks he said Ill let you know when I have the bunnies

As we walked slowly back from the stables we caught sight of Tom down
at the boathouse just putting off in the motorboat with his uncle and
cousin Craig waved to him and he walked up to meet us

While youre in Saranac said Craig buy me a dozen or so testtubes
Only dont let anyone here at the house know you are buying them They
might ask questions

While they were gone Kennedy stole into James Langleys room and after
a few minutes returned to our room with the huntingjacket He carefully
examined it with his pocket lens Then he filled a drinkingglass with
warm boiled water and added a few pinches of table salt With a piece
of sterilised gauze from Doctor Putnams medicinechest he carefully
washed off a few portions of the coat and set the glass and the gauze
soaking in it aside Then he returned the coat to the closet where
he had found it Next as silently he stole into Juniors room and
repeated the process with his huntingjacket using another glass and
piece of gauze

While I am out of the room Walter he said I want you to take these
two glasses cover them and number them and on a slip of paper which
you must retain place the names of the owners of the respective coats
I dont like this part of itI hate to play spy and would much rather
come out in the open but there is nothing else to do and it is much
better for all concerned that I should play the game secretly just
now There may be no cause for suspicion at all In that case Id never
forgive myself for starting a family row And then again but we shall
see

After I had numbered and recorded the glasses Kennedy returned and we
went downstairs again

Curious about the will isnt it I remarked as we stood on the wide
verandah a moment

Yes he replied It may be necessary to go back to New York to delve
into that part of it before we get through but I hope not Well wait

At this point the groom interrupted us to say that he had caught the
rabbits Kennedy at once hurried to the stable There he rolled up his
sleeves pricked a vein in his arm and injected a small quantity of his
own blood into one of the rabbits The other he did not touch

It was late in the afternoon when Tom returned from town with his uncle
and cousin He seemed even more agitated than usual Without a word he
hurried up from the landing and sought us out

What do you think of that he cried opening a copy of the Record and
laying it flat on the library table

There on the front page was Lewis Langleys picture with a huge
scarehead

 MYSTERIOUS CASE OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION

Its all out groaned Tom as we bent over to read the account And
such a story

Under the date of the day previous a Saranac despatch ran

Lewis Langley well known as sporting man and club member in New York
and eldest son of the late Lewis Langley the banker was discovered
dead under the most mysterious circumstances this morning at Camp
Hangout twelve miles from this town

The Death of Old Krook in Dickenss Bleak House or of the victim in
one of Marryats most thrilling tales was not more gruesome than this
actual fact It is without doubt a case of spontaneous human combustion
such as is recorded beyond dispute in medical and medicolegal
textbooks of the past two centuries Scientists in this city consulted
for the Record agree that while rare spontaneous human combustion is
an established fact and that everything in this curious case goes to
show that another has been added to the already wellauthenticated
list of cases recorded in America and Europe The family refuse to be
interviewed which seems to indicate that the rumours in medical circles
in Saranac have a solid basis of fact

Then followed a circumstantial account of the life of Langley and the
events leading up to the discovery of the bodyfairly accurate in
itself but highly coloured

The Record man must have made good use of his time here I commented
as I finished reading the despatch Andwell they must have done some
hard work in New York to get this story up so completelysee after
the despatch follow a lot of interviews and here is a short article on
spontaneous combustion itself

Harrington and the rest of the family had just come in

Whats this we hear about the Record having an article Harrington
asked Read it aloud Professor so we can all hear it

Spontaneous human combustion or catacausis ebriosus began Craig
is one of the baffling human scientific mysteries Indeed there can
be no doubt but that individuals have in some strange and inexplicable
manner caught fire and been partially or almost wholly consumed

Some have attributed it to gases in the body such as carbureted
hydrogen Once it was noted at the Hotel Dieu in Paris that a body on
being dissected gave forth a gas which was inflammable and burned with a
bluish flame Others have attributed the combustion to alcohol A toper
several years ago in Brooklyn and New York used to make money by blowing
his breath through a wire gauze and lighting it Whatever the cause
medical literature records seventysix cases of catacausis in two
hundred years

The combustion seems to be sudden and is apparently confined to
the cavities the abdomen chest and head Victims of ordinary fire
accidents rush hither and thither frantically succumb from exhaustion
their limbs are burned and their clothing is all destroyed But in
catacausis they are stricken down without warning the limbs are rarely
burned and only the clothing in contact with the head and chest is
consumed The residue is like a distillation of animal tissue grey and
dark with an overpoweringly fetid odour They are said to burn with
a flickering stifled blue flame and water far from arresting the
combustion seems to add to it Gin is particularly rich in inflammable
empyreumatic oils as they are called and in most cases it is recorded
that the catacausis took place among gindrinkers old and obese

Within the past few years cases are on record which seem to establish
catacausis beyond doubt In one case the heat was so great as to explode
a pistol in the pocket of the victim In another a woman the victims
husband was asphyxiated by the smoke The woman weighed one hundred and
eighty pounds in life but the ashes weighed only twelve pounds In all
these cases the proof of spontaneous combustion seems conclusive

As Craig finished reading we looked blankly horrified at one another
It was too dreadful to realise

What do you think of it Professor asked James Langley at length
Ive read somewhere of such cases but to think of its actually
happeningand to my own brother Do you really think Lewis could have
met his death in this terrible manner

Kennedy made no reply Harrington seemed absorbed in thought A shudder
passed over us as we thought about it But gruesome as it was it was
evident that the publication of the story in the Record had relieved the
feelings of the family group in one respectit at least seemed to offer
an explanation It was noticeable that the suspicious air with which
everyone had regarded everyone else was considerably dispelled

Tom said nothing until the others had withdrawn Kennedy he
burst out then do you believe that such combustion is absolutely
spontaneous Dont you believe that something else is necessary to start
it

Id rather not express an opinion just yet Tom answered Craig
carefully Now if you can get Harrington and Doctor Putnam away from
the house for a short time as you did with your uncle and cousin this
morning I may be able to tell you something about this case soon

Again Kennedy stole into another bedroom and returned to our room with
a huntingjacket Just as he had done before he carefully washed it
off with the gauze soaked in the salt solution and quickly returned the
coat repeating the process with Doctor Putnams coat and last that of
Tom himself Finally he turned his back while I sealed the glasses and
marked and recorded them on my slip

The next day was spent mainly in preparations for the journey to New
York with the body of Lewis Langley Kennedy was very busy on
what seemed to me to be preparations for some mysterious chemical
experiments I found myself fully occupied in keeping special
correspondents from all over the country at bay

That evening after dinner we were all sitting in the open summer house
over the boathouse Smudges of green pine were burning and smoking on
little artificial islands of stone near the lake shore lighting up the
trees on every side with a red glare Tom and his sister were seated
with Kennedy and myself on one side while some distance from us
Harrington was engaged in earnest conversation with Isabelle The other
members of the family were further removed That seemed typical to me of
the way the family group split up

Mr Kennedy remarked Grace in a thoughtful low tone what do you
make of that Record article

Very clever no doubt replied Craig

But dont you think it strange about the will

Hush whispered Tom for Isabelle and Harrington had ceased talking
and might perhaps be listening

Just then one of the servants came up with a telegram

Tom hastily opened it and read the message eagerly in the corner of the
summer house nearest one of the glowing smudges I felt instinctively
that it was from his lawyer He turned and beckoned to Kennedy and
myself

What do you think of that he whispered hoarsely

We bent over and in the flickering light read the message


New York papers full of spontaneous combustion story Record had
exclusive story yesterday but all papers today feature even more
Is it true Please wire additional details at once Also immediate
instructions regarding loss of will Has been abstracted from safe
Could Lewis Langley have taken it himself Unless new facts soon must
make loss public or issue statement Lewis Langley intestate

 DANIEL CLARK


Tom looked blankly at Kennedy and then at his sister who was sitting
alone I thought I could read what was passing in his mind With all
his faults Lewis Langley had been a good fosterparent to his adopted
children But it was all over now if the will was lost

What can I do asked Tom hopelessly I have nothing to reply to him

But I have quietly returned Kennedy deliberately folding up the
message and handing it back Tell them all to be in the library in
fifteen minutes This message hurries me a bit but I am prepared You
will have something to wire Mr Clark after that Then he strode
off toward the house leaving us to gather the group together in
considerable bewilderment

A quarter of an hour later we had all assembled in the library across
the hall from the room in which Lewis Langley had been found As usual
Kennedy began by leaping straight into the middle of his subject

Early in the eighteenth century he commenced slowly a woman was
found burned to death There were no clues and the scientists of that
time suggested spontaneous combustion This explanation was accepted
The theory always has been that the process of respiration by which
the tissues of the body are used up and got rid of gives the body a
temperature and it has seemed that it may be possible by preventing
the escape of this heat to set fire to the body

We were leaning forward expectantly horrified by the thought that
perhaps after all the Record was correct

Now resumed Kennedy his tone changing suppose we try a little
experimentone that was tried very convincingly by the immortal Liebig
Here is a sponge I am going to soak it in gin from this bottle the
same that Mr Langley was drinking from on the night of theerthe
tragedy

Kennedy took the saturated sponge and placed it in an agateiron pan
from the kitchen Then he lighted it The bluish flame shot upward
and in tense silence we watched it burn lower and lower till all the
alcohol was consumed Then he picked up the sponge and passed it around
It was dry but the sponge itself had not been singed

We now know he continued that from the nature of combustion it
is impossible for the human body to undergo spontaneous ignition
or combustion in the way the scientific experts of the past century
believed Swathe the body in the thickest of nonconductors of heat and
what happens A profuse perspiration exudes and before such an ignition
could possibly take place all the moisture of the body would have to be
evaporated As seventyfive per cent or more of the body is water it
is evident that enormous heat would be necessarymoisture is the great
safeguard The experiment which I have shown you could be duplicated
with specimens of human organs preserved for years in alcohol in
museums They would burn just as this spongethe specimen itself would
be very nearly uninjured by the burning of the alcohol

Then Professor Kennedy you maintain that my brother did not meet his
death by such an accident asked James Langley

Exactly that sir replied Craig One of the most important aspects
of the historic faith in this phenomenon is that of its skilful
employment in explaining away what would otherwise appear to be
convincing circumstantial evidence in cases of accusations of murder

Then how do you explain Mr Langleys death demanded Harrington My
theory of a spark from a cigar may be true after all

I am coming to that in a moment answered Kennedy quietly My first
suspicion was aroused by what not even Doctor Putnam seems to have
noticed The skull of Mr Langley charred and consumed as it was
seemed to show marks of violence It might have been from a fracture of
the skull or it might have been an accident to his remains as they were
being removed to the anteroom Again his tongue seemed as though it was
protruding That might have been natural suffocation or it might have
been from forcible strangulation So far I had nothing but conjecture to
work on But in looking over the livingroom I found near the table on
the hardwood floor a spotjust one little round spot Now deductions
from spots even if we know them to be blood must be made very
carefully I did not know this to be a bloodspot and so was very
careful at first

Let us assume it was a bloodspot however What did it show It was
just a little regular round spot quite thick Now drops of blood
falling only a few inches usually make a round spot with a smooth
border Still the surface on which the drop falls is quite as much a
factor as the height from which it falls If the surface is rough
the border may be irregular But this was a smooth surface and not
absorbent The thickness of a dried bloodspot on a nonabsorbent
surface is less the greater the height from which it has fallen This
was a thick spot Now if it had fallen say six feet the height of Mr
Langley the spot would have been thinsome secondary spatters
might have been seen or at least an irregular edge around the spot
Therefore if it was a bloodspot it had fallen only one or two feet
I ascertained next that the lower part of the body showed no wounds or
bruises whatever

Tracks of blood such as are left by dragging a bleeding body differ
very greatly from tracks of arterial blood which are left when the
victim has strength to move himself Continuing my speculations
supposing it to be a bloodspot what did it indicate Clearly that
Mr Langley was struck by somebody on the head with a heavy instrument
perhaps in another part of the room that he was choked that as the
drops of blood oozed from the wound on his head he was dragged across
the floor in the direction of the fireplace

But Professor Kennedy interrupted Doctor Putnam have you proved
that the spot was a bloodspot Might it not have been a paintspot or
something of that sort

Kennedy had apparently been waiting for just such a question

Ordinarily water has no effect on paint he answered I found that
the spot could be washed off with water That is not all I have a test
for blood that is so delicately sensitive that the blood of an Egyptian
mummy thousands of years old will respond to it It was discovered by
a German scientist Doctor Uhlenhuth and was no longer ago than last
winter applied in England in connection with the Clapham murder
The suspected murderer declared that stains on his clothes were only
spatters of paint but the test proved them to be spatters of blood
Walter bring in the cage with the rabbits

I opened the door and took the cage from the groom who had brought it
up from the stable and stood waiting with it some distance away

This test is very simple Doctor Putnam continued Craig as I placed
the cage on the table and Kennedy unwrapped the sterilised testtubes
A rabbit is inoculated with human blood and after a time the serum
that is taken from the rabbit supplies the material for the test

I will insert this needle in one of these rabbits which has been so
inoculated and will draw off some of the serum which I place in this
testtube to the right The other rabbit has not been inoculated I draw
off some of its serum and place that tube here on the leftwe will call
that our control tube It will check the results of our tests

Wrapped up in this paper I have the scrapings of the spot which I
found on the floorjust a few grains of dark dried powder To show
how sensitive the test is I will take only one of the smallest of these
minute scrapings I dissolve it in this third tube with distilled water
I will even divide it in half and place the other half in this fourth
tube

Next I add some of the serum of the uninoculated rabbit to the half in
this tube You observe nothing happens I add a little of the serum of
the inoculated rabbit to the other half in this other tube Observe how
delicate the test is

Kennedy was leaning forward almost oblivious of the rest of us in the
room talking almost as if to himself We too had riveted our eyes on
the tubes

As he added the serum from the inoculated rabbit a cloudy milky ring
formed almost immediately in the hitherto colourless very dilute
bloodsolution

That concluded Craig triumphantly holding the tube aloft that
conclusively proves that the little round spot on the hardwood floor was
not paint was not anything in this wide world but blood

No one in the room said a word but I knew there must have been someone
there who thought volumes in the few minutes that elapsed

Having found one bloodspot I began to look about for more but was
able to find only two or three traces where spots seemed to have been
The fact is that the blood spots had been apparently carefully wiped up
That is an easy matter Hot water and salt or hot water alone or even
cold water will make quite short work of fresh bloodspotsat least
to all outward appearances But nothing but a most thorough cleaning
can conceal them from the Uhlenhuth test even when they are apparently
wiped out It is a case of Lady Macbeth over again crying in the face
of modern science Out out damned spot

I was able with sufficient definiteness to trace roughly a course
of bloodspots from the fireplace to a point near the door of the
livingroom But beyond the door in the hall nothing

Still interrupted Harrington to get back to the facts in the case
They are perfectly in accord either with my theory of the cigar or the
Records of spontaneous combustion How do you account for the facts

I suppose you refer to the charred head the burned neck the upper
chest cavity while the arms and legs were untouched

Yes and then the body was found in the midst of combustible
furniture that was not touched It seems to me that even the
spontaneouscombustion theory has considerable support in spite of this
very interesting circumstantial evidence about bloodspots Next to my
own theory the combustion theory seems most in harmony with the facts

If you will go over in your mind all the points proved to have been
discoverednot the added points in the Record storyI think you
will agree with me that mine is a more logical interpretation than
spontaneous combustion reasoned Craig Hear me out and you will see
that the facts are more in harmony with my less fanciful explanation
No someone struck Lewis Langley down either in passion or in cold
blood and then seeing what he had done made a desperate effort to
destroy the evidence of violence Consider my next discovery

Kennedy placed the five glasses which I had carefully sealed and
labelled on the table before us

The next step he said was to find out whether any articles of
clothing in the house showed marks that might be suspected of being
bloodspots And here I must beg the pardon of all in the room for
intruding in their private wardrobes But in this crisis it was
absolutely necessary and under such circumstances I never let ceremony
stand before justice

In these five glasses on the table I have the washings of spots from
the clothing worn by Tom Mr James Langley Junior Harrington Brown
and Doctor Putnam I am not going to tell you which is whichindeed I
merely have them marked and I do not know them myself But Mr Jameson
has the marks with the names opposite on a piece of paper in his pocket
I am simply going to proceed with the tests to see if any of the stains
on the coats were of blood

Just then Doctor Putnam interposed One question Professor Kennedy
It is a comparatively easy thing to recognise a bloodstain but it is
difficult usually impossible to tell whether the blood is that of a
man or of an animal I recall that we were all in our huntingjackets
that day had been all day Now in the morning there had been an
operation on one of the horses at the stable and I assisted the
veterinary from town I may have got a spot or two of blood on my coat
from that operation Do I understand that this test would show that

No replied Craig this test would not show that Other tests would
but not this But if the spot of human blood were less than the size of
a pinhead it would showit would show if the spot contained even
so little as one twentythousandth of a gram of albumin Blood from a
horse a deer a sheep a pig a dog could be obtained but when the
test was applied the liquid in which they were diluted would remain
clear No white precipitin as it is called would form But let human
blood ever so diluted be added to the serum of the inoculated rabbit
and the test is absolute

A deathlike silence seemed to pervade the room Kennedy slowly and
deliberately began to test the contents of the glasses Dropping into
each as he broke the seal some of the serum of the rabbit he waited a
moment to see if any change occurred

It was thrilling I think no one could have gone through that fifteen
minutes without having it indelibly impressed on his memory I recall
thinking as Kennedy took each glass Which is it to be guilt or
innocence life or death Could it be possible that a mans life might
hang on such a slender thread I knew Kennedy was too accurate and
serious to deceive us It was not only possible it was actually a fact

The first glass showed no reaction Someone had been vindicated

The second was neutral likewiseanother person in the room had been
proved innocent

The thirdno change Science had released a third

The fourth

Almost it seemed as if the record in my pocket burnedspontaneouslyso
intense was my feeling There in the glass was that fatal telltale
white precipitate

My God its the milk ring whispered Tom close to my ear

Hastily Kennedy dropped the serum into the fifth It remained as clear
as crystal

My hand trembled as it touched the envelope containing my record of the
names

The person who wore the coat with that bloodstain on it declared
Kennedy solemnly was the person who struck Lewis Langley down who
choked him and then dragged his scarcely dead body across the floor
and obliterated the marks of violence in the blazing log fire Jameson
whose name is opposite the sign on this glass

I could scarcely tear the seal to look at the paper in the envelope At
last I unfolded it and my eye fell on the name opposite the fatal sign
But my mouth was dry and my tongue refused to move It was too much
like reading a deathsentence With my finger on the name I faltered an
instant

Tom leaned over my shoulder and read it to himself For Heavens sake
Jameson he cried let the ladies retire before you read the name

Its not necessary said a thick voice We quarrelled over the
estate My shares mortgaged up to the limit and Lewis refused to lend
me more even until I could get Isabelle happily married Now Lewiss
goes to an outsiderHarrington boy take care of Isabelle fortune or
no fortune Good

Someone seized James Langleys arm as he pressed an automatic revolver
to his temple He reeled like a drunken man and dropped the gun on the
floor with an oath

Beaten again he muttered Forgot to move the ratchet from safety
to fire

Like a madman he wrenched himself loose from us sprang through the
door and darted upstairs Ill show you some combustion he shouted
back fiercely

Kennedy was after him like a flash The will he cried

We literally tore the door off its hinges and burst into James Langleys
room He was bending eagerly over the fireplace Kennedy made a flying
leap at him Just enough of the will was left unburned to be admitted to
probate




IX The Terror In The Air

Theres something queer about these aeroplane accidents at Belmore
Park mused Kennedy one evening as his eye caught a big headline in
the last edition of the Star which I had brought uptown with me

Queer I echoed Unfortunate terrible but hardly queer Why it is
a common saying among the aeronauts that if they keep at it long enough
they will all lose their lives

Yes I know that rejoined Kennedy but Walter have you noticed
that all these accidents have happened to Nortons new gyroscope
machines

Well what of that I replied Isnt it just barely possible that
Norton is on the wrong track in applying the gyroscope to an aeroplane
I cant say I know much about either the gyroscope or the aeroplane but
from what I hear the fellows at the office say it would seem to me that
the gyroscope is a pretty good thing to keep off an aeroplane not to
put on it

Why asked Kennedy blandly

Well it seems to me from what the experts say that anything which
tends to keep your machine in one position is just what you dont want
in an aeroplane What surprises them they say is that the thing seems
to work so well up to a certain pointthat the accidents dont happen
sooner Why our man on the aviation field tells me that when that
poor fellow Browne was killed he had all but succeeded in bringing his
machine to a dead stop in the air In other words he would have won the
Brooks Prize for perfect motionlessness in one place And then Herrick
the day before was going about seventy miles an hour when he collapsed
They said it was heart failure But tonight another expert says in
the Starhere Ill read it The real cause was carbonicacidgas
poisoning due to the pressure on the mouth from driving fast through the
air and the consequent inability to expel the poisoned air which had
been breathed Air once breathed is practically carbonicacidgas When
one is passing rapidly through the air this carbonicacidgas is pushed
back into the lungs and only a little can get away because of the rush
of air pressure into the mouth So it is rebreathed and the result is
gradual carbonicacidgas poisoning which produces a kind of narcotic
sleep

Then it wasnt the gyroscope in that case said Kennedy with a rising
inflection

No I admitted reluctantly perhaps not

I could see that I had been rash in talking so long Kennedy had only
been sounding me to see what the newspapers thought of it His next
remark was characteristic

Norton has asked me to look into the thing he said quietly If his
invention is a failure he is a ruined man All his money is in it
he is suing a man for infringing on his patent and he is liable
for damages to the heirs according to his agreement with Browne and
Herrick I have known Norton some time in fact he worked out his ideas
at the university physical laboratory I have flown in his machine and
it is the most marvellous biplane I ever saw Walter I want you to get
a Belmore Park assignment from the Star and go out to the aviation meet
with me tomorrow Ill take you on the field around the machinesyou
can get enough local colour to do a dozen Star specials later on I may
add that devising a flyingmachine capable of remaining stationary in
the air means a revolution that will relegate all other machines to the
scrapheap From a military point of view it is the one thing necessary
to make the aeroplane the superior in every respect to the dirigible

The regular contests did not begin until the afternoon but Kennedy
and I decided to make a day of it and early the next morning we were
speeding out to the park where the flights were being held

We found Charles Norton the inventor anxiously at work with his
mechanicians in the big temporary shed that had been accorded him and
was dignified with the name of hangar

I knew you would come Professor he exclaimed running forward to
meet us

Of course echoed Kennedy Im too much interested in this invention
of yours not to help you Norton You know what Ive always thought of
itIve told you often that it is the most important advance since the
original discovery by the Wrights that the aeroplane could be balanced
by warping the planes

Im just fixing up my third machine said Norton If anything
happens to it I shall lose the prize at least as far as this meet is
concerned for I dont believe I shall get my fourth and newest model
from the makers in time Anyhow if I did I couldnt pay for itI am
ruined if I dont win that twentyfivethousanddollar Brooks Prize
And besides a couple of army men are coming to inspect my aeroplane
and report to the War Department on it Id have stood a good chance
of selling it I think if my flights here had been like the trials you
saw But Kennedy he added and his face was drawn and tragic Id
drop the whole thing if I didnt know I was right Two men deadthink
of it Why even the newspapers are beginning to call me a cold
heartless scientific crank to keep on But Ill show themthis
afternoon Im going to fly myself Im not afraid to go anywhere I send
my men Ill die before Ill admit Im beaten

It was easy to see why Kennedy was fascinated by a man of Nortons
type Anyone would have been It was not foolhardiness It was dogged
determination faith in himself and in his own ability to triumph over
every obstacle

We now slowly entered the shed where two men were working over Nortons
biplane One of the men was a Frenchman Jaurette who had worked with
Farman a silent darkbrowed weatherbeaten fellow with a sort of
sullen politeness The other man was an American Roy Sinclair a tall
lithe wiry chap with a seamed and furrowed face and a loosejointed
but very deft manner which marked him a born birdman Nortons third
aviator Humphreys who was not to fly that day much to his relief was
reading a paper in the back of the shed

We were introduced to him and be seemed to be a very companionable sort
of fellow though not given to talking

Mr Norton he said after the introduction theres quite an account
of your injunction against Delanne in this paper It doesnt seem to be
very friendly he added indicating the article

Norton read it and frowned Humph Ill show them yet that my
application of the gyroscope is patentable Delanne will put me into
interference in the patent office as the lawyers call it will he
Well I filed a caveat over a year and a half ago If Im wrong hes
wrong and all gyroscope patents are wrong and if Im right by George
Im first in the field Thats so isnt it he appealed to Kennedy

Kennedy shrugged his shoulders noncommittally as if he had never
heard of the patent office or the gyroscope in his life The men were
listening whether or not from loyalty I could not tell

Let us see your gyroplane I mean aeroscopewhatever it is you call
it asked Kennedy

Norton took the cue Now you newspaper men are the first that Ive
allowed in here he said Can I trust your word of honour not to
publish a line except such as I OK after you write it

We promised

As Norton directed the mechanicians wheeled the aeroplane out on the
field in front of the shed No one was about

Now this is the gyroscope began Norton pointing out a thing encased
in an aluminum sheath which weighed all told perhaps fourteen or
fifteen pounds You see the gyroscope is really a flywheel mounted
on gimbals and can turn on any of its angles so that it can assume any
angle in space When its at rest like this you can turn it easily But
when set revolving it tends to persist always in the plane in which it
was started rotating

I took hold of it and it did turn readily in any direction I could
feel the heavy little flywheel inside

There is a pretty high vacuum in that aluminum case went on Norton
Theres very little friction on that account The power to rotate the
flywheel is obtained from this little dynamo here run by the gasengine
which also turns the propellers of the aeroplane

But suppose the engine stops how about the gyroscope I asked
sceptically

It will go right on for several minutes You know the Brennan monorail
car will stand up some time after the power is shut off And I carry a
small storagebattery that will run it for some time too Thats all
been guarded against

Jaurette cranked the engine a sevencylindered affair with the
cylinders sticking out like the spokes of a wheel without a rim The
propellers turned so fast that I could not see the bladesturned
with that strong steady fierce droning buzz that can be heard a long
distance and which is a thrilling sound to hear Norton reached over and
attached the little dynamo at the same time setting the gyroscope at
its proper angle and starting it

This is the mechanical brain of my new flier he remarked patting the
aluminum case lovingly You can look in through this little window in
the case and see the flywheel inside revolvingten thousand revolutions
a minute Press down on the gyroscope he shouted to me

As I placed both hands on the case of the apparently frail little
instrument he added You remember how easily you moved it just a
moment ago

I pressed down with all my might Then I literally raised myself off
my feet and my whole weight was on the gyroscope That uncanny little
instrument seemed to resentyes thats the word resentmy touch
It was almost human in the resentment too Far from yielding to me it
actually rose on the side I was pressing down

The men who were watching me laughed at the puzzled look on my face

I took my hands off and the gyroscope leisurely and nonchalantly went
back to its original position

Thats the property we use applied to the rudder and the
aileronsthose flat planes between the large main planes That gives
automatic stability to the machine continued Norton Im not going
to explain how it is doneit is in the combination of the various parts
that I have discovered the basic principle and Im not going to talk
about it till the thing is settled by the courts But it is there and
the court will see it and Ill prove that Delanne is a frauda fraud
when he says that my combination isnt patentable and isnt practicable
even at that The truth is that his device as it stands isnt
practicable and besides if he makes it so it infringes on mine Would
you like to take a flight with me

I looked at Kennedy and a vision of the wreckage of the two previous
accidents as the Star photographer had snapped them flashed across my
mind But Kennedy was too quick for me

Yes he answered A short flight No stunts

We took our seats by Norton I at least with some misgiving Gently
the machine rose into the air The sensation was delightful The fresh
air of the morning came with a stinging rush to my face Below I could
see the earth sweeping past as if it were a movingpicture film Above
the continuous roar of the engine and propeller Norton indicated
to Kennedy the automatic balancing of the gyroscope as it bent the
ailerons

Could you fly in this machine without the gyroscope at all yelled
Kennedy The noise was deafening conversation almost impossible Though
sitting side by side he had to repeat his remark twice to Norton

Yes called back Norton Reaching back of him he pointed out the way
to detach the gyroscope and put a sort of brake on it that stopped its
revolutions almost instantly Its a ticklish job to change in the
air he shouted It can be done but its safer to land and do it

The flight was soon over and we stood admiring the machine while Norton
expatiated on the compactness of his little dynamo

What have you done with the wrecks of the other machines inquired
Kennedy at length

They are stored in a shed down near the railroad station They are just
a mass of junk though there are some parts that I can use so Ill ship
them back to the factory

Might I have a look at them

Surely Ill give you the key Sorry I cant go myself but I want to
be sure everything is all right for my flight this afternoon

It was a long walk over to the shed near the station and together
with our examination of the wrecked machines it took us the rest of the
morning Craig carefully turned over the wreckage It seemed a hopeless
quest to me but I fancied that to him it merely presented new problems
for his deductive and scientific mind

These gyroscopes are out of business for good he remarked as he
glanced at the dented and battered aluminum cases But there doesnt
seem to be anything wrong with them except what would naturally happen
in such accidents

For my part I felt a sort of awe at the mass of wreckage in which Browne
and Herrick had been killed It was to me more than a tangled mass of
wires and splinters Two human lives had been snuffed out in it

The engines are a mass of scrap see how the cylinders are bent and
twisted remarked Kennedy with great interest The gasolinetank is
intact but dented out of shape No explosion there And look at this
dynamo Why the wires in it are actually fused together The insulation
has been completely burned off I wonder what could have caused that

Kennedy continued to regard the tangled mass thoughtfully for some time
then locked the door and we strolled back to the grand stand on our
side of the field Already the crowd had begun to collect Across the
field we could see the various machines in front of their hangars with
the men working on them The buzz of the engines was wafted across by
the light summer breeze as if a thousand cicadas had broken loose to
predict warm weather

Two machines were already in flight a little yellow Demoiselle
scurrying around close to the earth like a frightened hen and a
Bleriot high overhead making slow and graceful turns like a huge bird

Kennedy and I stopped before the little wireless telegraph station of
the signal corps in front of the grand stand and watched the operator
working over his instruments

There it is again muttered the operator angrily

Whats the matter asked Kennedy Amateurs interfering with you

The man nodded a reply shaking his head with the telephonelike
receiver viciously He continued to adjust his apparatus

Confound it he exclaimed Yes that fellow has been jamming me for
the past two days off and on every time I get ready to send or receive
a message Williams is going up with a Wright machine equipped with
wireless apparatus in a minute and this fellow wont get out of the
way By Jove though those are powerful impulses of his Hear that
crackling Ive never been interfered with so in my experience Touch
that screen door with your knife

Kennedy did so and elicited large sparks with quite a tingle of a
shock

Yesterday and the day before it was so bad we had to give up attempting
to communicate with Williams continued the operator It was worse
than trying to work in a thundershower Thats the time we get our
troubles when the air is overcharged with electricity as it is now

Thats interesting remarked Kennedy

Interesting flashed back the operator angrily noting the condition
in his log book

Maybe it is but I call it darned mean Its almost like trying to work
in a power station

Indeed queried Kennedy I beg your pardonI was only looking at it
from the purely scientific point of view Who is it do you suppose

How do I know Some amateur I guess No professional would butt in
this way

Kennedy took a leaf out of his notebook and wrote a short message which
he gave to a boy to deliver to Norton

Detach your gyroscope and dynamo it read Leave them in the hangar
Fly without them this afternoon and see what happens No use to try for
the prize today Kennedy

We sauntered out on the open part of the field back of the fence and to
the side of the stands and watched the fliers for a few moments Three
were in the air now and I could see Norton and his men getting ready

The boy with the message was going rapidly across the field Kennedy was
impatiently watching him It was too far off to see just what they were
doing but as Norton seemed to get down out of his seat in the aeroplane
when the boy arrived and it was wheeled back into the shed I gathered
that he was detaching the gyroscope and was going to make the flight
without it as Kennedy had requested

In a few minutes it was again wheeled out

The crowd which had been waiting especially to see Norton applauded

Come Walter exclaimed Kennedy lets go up there on the roof of the
stand where we can see better Theres a platform and railing I see

His pass allowed him to go anywhere on the field so in a few moments we
were up on the roof

It was a fascinating vantagepoint and I was so deeply engrossed
between watching the crowd below the birdmen in the air and the
machines waiting across the field that I totally neglected to notice
what Kennedy was doing When I did I saw that he had deliberately
turned his back on the aviation field and was anxiously scanning the
country back of us

What are you looking for I asked Turn around I think Norton is
just about to fly

Watch him then answered Craig Tell me when he gets in the air

Just then Nortons aeroplane rose gently from the field A wild shout
of applause came from the people below us at the heroism of the man who
dared to fly this new and apparently fated machine It was succeeded by
a breathless deathly calm as if after the first burst of enthusiasm
the crowd had suddenly realised the danger of the intrepid aviator
Would Norton add a third to the fatalities of the meet

Suddenly Kennedy jerked my arm Walter look over there across the road
back of usat the old weatherbeaten barn I mean the one next to that
yellow house What do you see

Nothing except that on the peak of the roof there is a pole that looks
like the short stub of a small wireless mast I should say there was a
boy connected with that barn a boy who has read a book on wireless for
beginners

Maybe said Kennedy But is that all you see Look up in the little
window of the gable the one with the closed shutter

I looked carefully It seems to me that I saw a gleam of something
bright at the top of the shutter Craig I ventured A spark or a
flash

It must be a bright spark for the sun is shining brightly mused
Craig

Oh maybe its the small boy with a lookingglass I can remember when
I used to get behind such a window and shine a glass into the darkened
room of my neighbours across the street

I had really said that half in raillery for I was at a loss to account
in any other way for the light but I was surprised to see how eagerly
Craig accepted it

Perhaps you are right in a way he assented I guess it isnt a
spark after all Yes it must be the reflection of the sun on a piece
of glassthe angles are just about right for it Anyhow it caught my
eye Still I believe that barn will bear watching

Whatever his suspicions Craig kept them to himself and descended
At the same time Norton gently dropped back to earth in front of his
hangar not ten feet from the spot where he started The applause was
deafening as the machine was again wheeled into the shed safely

Kennedy and I pushed through the crowd to the wireless operator

Hows she working inquired Craig

Rotten replied the operator sullenly It was worse than ever about
five minutes ago Its much better now almost normal again

Just then the messengerboy who had been hunting through the crowd for
us handed Kennedy a note It was merely a scrawl from Norton


 Everything seems fine Am going to try her next with the
 gyroscope NORTON


Boy exclaimed Craig has Cdr Norton a telephone

No sir only that hangar at the end has a telephone

Well you run across that field as fast as your legs can carry you and
tell him if he values his life not to do it

Not to do what sir

Dont stand there youngster Run Tell him not to fly with that
gyroscope Theres a fivespot in it if you get over there before he
starts

Even as he spoke the Norton aeroplane was wheeled out again In a minute
Norton had climbed up into his seat and was testing the levers

Would the boy reach him in time He was half across the field waving
his arms like mad But apparently Norton and his men were too engrossed
in their machine to pay attention

Good heavens exclaimed Craig Hes going to try it Run boy run
he cried although the boy was now far out of hearing

Across the field we could hear now the quick staccato chugchug of the
engine Slowly Nortons aeroplane this time really equipped with
the gyroscope rose from the field and circled over toward us Craig
frantically signalled to him to come down but of course Norton could
not have seen him in the crowd As for the crowd they looked askance at
Kennedy as if he had taken leave of his senses

I heard the wireless operator cursing the way his receiver was acting

Higher and higher Norton went in one spiral after another those spirals
which his gyroscope had already made famous

The man with the megaphone in front of the judges stand announced in
hollow tones that Mr Norton had given notice that he would try for the
Brooks Prize for stationary equilibrium

Kennedy and I stood speechless helpless appalled

Slower and slower went the aeroplane It seemed to hover just like the
big mechanical bird that it was

Kennedy was anxiously watching the judges with one eye and Norton with
the other A few in the crowd could no longer restrain their applause I
remember that the wireless back of us was spluttering and crackling like
mad

All of a sudden a groan swept over the crowd Something was wrong with
Norton His aeroplane was swooping downward at a terrific rate Would he
be able to control it I held my breath and gripped Kennedy by the arm
Down down came Norton frantically fighting by main strength it seemed
to me to warp the planes so that their surface might catch the air and
check his descent

Hes trying to detach the gyroscope whispered Craig hoarsely

The football helmet which Norton wore blew off and fell more rapidly
than the plane I shut my eyes But Kennedys next exclamation caused me
quickly to open them again

Hell make it after all

Somehow Norton had regained partial control of his machine but it was
still swooping down at a tremendous pace toward the level centre of the
field

There was a crash as it struck the ground in a cloud of dust

With a leap Kennedy had cleared the fence and was running toward Norton
Two men from the judges stand were ahead of us but except for them
we were the first to reach him The men were tearing frantically at
the tangled framework trying to lift it off Norton who lay pale and
motionless pinned under it The machine was not so badly damaged after
all but that together we could lift it bodily off him

A doctor ran out from the crowd and hastily put his ear to Nortons
chest No one spoke but we all scanned the doctors face anxiously

Just stunnedhell be all right in a moment Get some water he said

Kennedy pulled my arm Look at the gyroscope dynamo he whispered

I looked Like the other two which we had seen it also was a wreck The
insulation was burned off the wires the wires were fused together and
the storagebattery looked as if it had been burned out

A flicker of the eyelid and Norton seemed to regain some degree of
consciousness He was living over again the ages that had passed during
the seconds of his terrible fall

Will they never stop Oh those sparks those sparks I cant
disconnect it Sparks more sparkswill they never So he rambled on
It was fearsome to hear him

But Kennedy was now sure that Norton was safe and in good hands and he
hurried back in the direction of the grand stand I followed Flying
was over for that day and the people were filing slowly out toward the
railroad station where the special trains were waiting We stopped at
the wireless station for a moment

Is it true that Norton will recover inquired the operator

Yes He was only stunned thank Heaven Did you keep a record of the
antics of your receiver since I saw you last

Yes sir And I made a copy for you By the way its working all right
now when I dont want it If Williams was only in the air now Id give
you a good demonstration of communicating with an aeroplane continued
the operator as he prepared to leave

Kennedy thanked him for the record and carefully folded it Joining the
crowd we pushed our way out but instead of going down to the station
with them Kennedy turned toward the barn and the yellow house

For some time we waited about casually but nothing occurred At length
Kennedy walked up to the shed The door was closed and double padlocked
He knocked but there was no answer

Just then a man appeared on the porch of the yellow house Seeing us he
beckoned As we approached he shouted Hes gone for the day

Has he a city addressany place I could reach him tonight asked
Craig

I dont know He hired the barn from me for two weeks and paid in
advance He told me if I wanted to address him the best way was Dr K
Lamar General Delivery New York City

Ah then I suppose I had better write to him said Kennedy apparently
much gratified to learn the name I presume hell be taking away his
apparatus soon

Cant say Theres enough of it Cy Smithhes in the electric light
company up to the villagesays the doctor has used a powerful lot of
current Hes good pay though hes awful closemouthed Flyings over
for today aint it Was that feller much hurt

No hell be all right tomorrow I think hell fly again The
machines in pretty good condition Hes bound to win that prize
Goodbye

As he walked away I remarked How do you know Norton will fly again

I dont answered Kennedy but I think that either he or Humphreys
will I wanted to see that this Lamar believes it anyhow By the way
Walter do you think you could grab a wire here and phone in a story
to the Star that Norton isnt much hurt and will probably be able to fly
tomorrow Try to get the City News Association too so that all
the papers will have it I dont care about risking the general
deliveryperhaps Lamar wont call for any mail but he certainly will
read the papers Put it in the form of an interview with NortonIll
see that it is all right and that there is no comeback Norton will
stand for it when I tell him my scheme

I caught the Star just in time for the last edition and some of the
other papers that had later editions also had the story Of course all
the morning papers had it

Norton spent the night in the Mineola Hospital He didnt really need to
stay but the doctor said it would be best in case some internal injury
had been overlooked Meanwhile Kennedy took charge of the hangar where
the injured machine was The men had been in a sort of panic
Humphrey could not be found and the only reason I think why the two
mechanicians stayed was because something was due them on their pay

Kennedy wrote them out personal checks for their respective amounts
but dated them two days ahead to insure their staying He threw off all
disguise now and with authority from Norton directed the repairing of
the machine Fortunately it was in pretty good condition The broken
part was the skids not the essential parts of the machine As for the
gyroscope there were plenty of them and another dynamo and it was a
very simple thing to replace the old one that had been destroyed

Sinclair worked with a will far past his regular hours Jaurette also
worked though one could hardly say with a will In fact most of the
work was done by Sinclair and Kennedy with Jaurette sullenly grumbling
mostly in French under his breath I did not like the fellow and was
suspicious of him I thought I noticed that Kennedy did not allow him
to do much of the work either though that may have been for the reason
that Kennedy never asked anyone to help him who seemed unwilling

There exclaimed Craig about ten oclock If we want to get back to
the city in any kind of time tonight we had better quit Sinclair I
think you can finish repairing these skids in the morning

We locked up the hangar and hurried across to the station It was late
when we arrived in New York but Kennedy insisted on posting off up to
his laboratory leaving me to run down to the Star office to make sure
that our story was all right for the morning papers

I did not see him until morning when a large touringcar drove up
Kennedy routed me out of bed In the tonneau of the car was a huge
package carefully wrapped up

Something I worked on for a couple of hours last night explained
Craig patting it If this doesnt solve the problem then Ill give it
up

I was burning with curiosity but somehow by a perverse association of
ideas I merely reproached Kennedy for not taking enough rest

Oh he smiled If I hadnt been working last night Walter I
couldnt have rested at all for thinking about it

When we arrived at the field Norton was already there with his head
bandaged I thought him a little pale but otherwise all right Jaurette
was sulking but Sinclair had finished the repairs and was busily
engaged in going over every bolt and wire Humphreys had sent word that
he had another offer and had not shown up

We must find him exclaimed Kennedy I want him to make a flight
today His contract calls for it

I can do it Kennedy asserted Norton See Im all right

He picked up two pieces of wire and held them at arms length bringing
them together tip to tip in front of him just to show us how he could
control his nerves

And Ill be better yet by this afternoon he added I can do that
stunt with the points of pins then

Kennedy shook his head gravely but Norton insisted and finally Kennedy
agreed to give up wasting time trying to locate Humphreys After that he
and Norton had a long whispered conference in which Kennedy seemed to be
unfolding a scheme

I understand said Norton at length you want me to put this
sheetlead cover over the dynamo and battery first Then you want me to
take the cover off and also to detach the gyroscope and to fly without
using it Is that it

Yes assented Craig I will be on the roof of the grand stand The
signal will be three waves of my hat repeated till I see you get it

After a quick luncheon we went up to our vantagepoint On the way
Kennedy had spoken to the head of the Pinkertons engaged by the
management for the meet and had also dropped in to see the wireless
operator to ask him to send up a messenger if he saw the same phenomena
as he had observed the day before

On the roof Kennedy took from his pocket a little instrument with a
needle which trembled back and forth over a dial It was nearing the
time for the start of the days flying and the aeroplanes were getting
ready Kennedy was calmly biting a cigar casting occasional glances at
the needle as it oscillated Suddenly as Williams rose in the Wright
machine the needle swung quickly and pointed straight at the aviation
field vibrating through a small area back and forth

The operator is getting his apparatus ready to signal to Williams
remarked Craig This is an apparatus called an ondometer It tells you
the direction and something of the magnitude of the Hertzian waves used
in wireless

Five or ten minutes passed Norton was getting ready to fly I could see
through my field glass that he was putting something over his gyroscope
and over the dynamo but could not quite make out what it was His
machine seemed to leap up in the air as if eager to redeem itself
Norton with his whitebandaged head was the hero of the hour No sooner
had his aeroplane got up over the level of the trees than I heard a
quick exclamation from Craig

Look at the needle Walter he cried As soon as Norton got into the
air it shot around directly opposite to the wireless station and now it
is pointing

We raised our eyes in the direction which it indicated It was precisely
in line with the weatherbeaten barn

I gasped What did it mean Did it mean in some way another accident to
Nortonperhaps fatal this time Why had Kennedy allowed him to try it
today when there was even a suspicion that some nameless terror was
abroad in the air Quickly I turned to see if Norton was all right Yes
there he was circling above us in a series of wide spirals climbing
up up Now he seemed almost to stop to hover motionless He was
motionless His engine had been cut out and I could see his propeller
stopped He was riding as a ship rides on the ocean

A boy ran up the ladder to the roof Kennedy unfolded the note and
shoved it into my hands It was from the operator

Wireless out of business again Curse that fellow who is butting in Am
keeping record was all it said

I shot a glance of inquiry at Kennedy but he was paying no attention
now to anything but Norton He held his watch in his hand

Walter he ejaculated as he snapped it shut it has now been seven
minutes and a half since he stopped his propeller The Brooks Prize
calls for five minutes only Norton has exceeded it fifty per cent Here
goes

With his hat in his hand he waved three times and stopped Then he
repeated the process

At the third time the aeroplane seemed to give a start The propeller
began to revolve Norton starting it on the compression successfully
Slowly he circled down again Toward the end of the descent he stopped
the engine and volplaned or coasted to the ground landing gently in
front of his hangar

A wild cheer rose into the air from the crowd below us All eyes
were riveted on the activity about Nortons biplane They were doing
something to it Whatever it was it was finished in a minute and the
men were standing again at a respectful distance from the propellers
Again Norton was in the air As he rose above the field Kennedy gave
a last glance at his ondometer and sprang down the ladder I followed
closely Back of the crowd he hurried down the walk to the entrance
near the railroad station The man in charge of the Pinkertons was at
the gate with two other men apparently waiting

Come on shouted Craig

We four followed him as fast as we could He turned in at the lane
running up to the yellow house so as to approach the barn from the
rear unobserved

Quietly now he cautioned

We were now at the door of the barn A curious crackling snapping noise
issued Craig gently tried the door It was bolted on the inside As
many of us as could threw ourselves like a human catapult against it It
yielded

Inside I saw a sheet of flame fifteen or twenty feet longit was a
veritable artificial bolt of lightning A man with a telescope had been
peering out of the window but now was facing us in surprise

Lamar shouted Kennedy drawing a pistol one motion of your hand
and you are a dead man Stand still where you are You are caught
redhanded

The rest of us shrank back in momentary fear of the gigantic forces of
nature which seemed let loose in the room The thought in my mind at
least was Suppose this archfiend should turn his deadly power on us

Kennedy saw us from the corner of his eye Dont be afraid he said
with just a curl to his lip Ive seen all this before It wont hurt
you Its a high frequency current The man has simply appropriated the
invention of Mr Nikola Tesla Seize him He wont struggle Ive got
him covered

Two burly Pinkertons leaped forward gingerly into the midst of the
electrical apparatus and in less time than it takes to write it Lamar
was hustled out to the doorway each arm pinioned back of him

As we stood half dazed by the suddenness of the turn of events Kennedy
hastily explained

Teslas theory is that under certain conditions the atmosphere which
is normally a high insulator assumes conducting properties and so
becomes capable of conveying any amount of electrical energy I myself
have seen electrical oscillations such as these in this room of such
intensity that while they could be circulated with impunity through
ones arms and chest they would melt wires farther along in the
circuit Yet the person through whom such a current is passing feels no
inconvenience I have seen a loop of heavy copper wire energised by such
oscillations and a mass of metal within the loop heated to the fusing
point and yet into the space in which this destructive aerial turmoil
was going on I have repeatedly thrust my hand and even my head without
feeling anything or experiencing any injurious aftereffect In this
form all the energy of all the dynamos of Niagara could pass through
ones body and yet produce no injury But diabolically directed this
vast energy has been used by this man to melt the wires in the little
dynamo that runs Nortons gyroscope That is all Now to the aviation
field I have something more to show you

We hurried as fast as we could up the street and straight out on the
field across toward the Norton hangar the crowd gaping in wonderment
Kennedy waved frantically for Norton to come down and Norton who was
only a few hundred feet in the air seemed to see and understand

As we stood waiting before the hangar Kennedy could no longer restrain
his impatience

I suspected some wirelesspower trick when I found that the field
wireless telegraph failed to work every time Nortons aeroplane was in
the air he said approaching close to Lamar I just happened to catch
sight of that peculiar wireless mast of yours A little flash of light
first attracted my attention to it I thought it was an electric spark
but you are too clever for that Lamar Still you forgot a much simpler
thing It was the glint of the sun on the lens of your telescope as you
were watching Norton that betrayed you

Lamar said nothing

Im glad to say you had no confederate in the hangar here continued
Craig At first I suspected it Anyhow you succeeded pretty well
single handed two lives lost and two machines wrecked Norton flew all
right yesterday when he left his gyroscope and dynamo behind but when
he took them along you were able to fuse the wires in the dynamoyou
pretty nearly succeeded in adding his name to those of Browne and
Herrick

The whir of Nortons machine told us he was approaching We scattered to
give him space enough to choose the spot where he would alight As the
men caught his machine to steady it he jumped lightly to the ground

Wheres Kennedy he asked and then without waiting for a reply
he exclaimed Queerest thing I ever saw up there The dynamo wasnt
protected by the sheetlead shield in this flight as in the first
today I hadnt risen a hundred feet before I happened to hear the
darndest sputtering in the dynamo Look boys the insulation is
completely burned off the wires and the wires are nearly all fused
together

So it was in the other two wrecked machines added Kennedy coming
coolly forward If you hadnt had everything protected by those shields
I gave you in your first flight today you would have simply repeated
your fall of yesterdayperhaps fatally This fellow has been directing
the full strength of his wireless hightension electricity straight at
you all the time

What fellow demanded Norton

The two Pinkertons shoved Lamar forward Norton gave a contemptuous look
at him Delanne he said I knew you were a crook when you tried
to infringe on my patent but I didnt think you were coward enough to
resort toto murder

Lamar or rather Delanne shrank back as if even the protection of his
captors was safety compared to the threatening advance of Norton toward
him

Pouff exclaimed Norton turning suddenly on his heel What a fool I
am The law will take care of such scoundrels as you Whats the grand
stand cheering for now he asked looking across the field in an effort
to regain his selfcontrol

A boy from one of the hangars down the line spoke up from the back of
the crowd in a shrill piping voice You have been awarded the Brooks
Prize sir he said




X The Black Hand

Kennedy and I had been dining rather late one evening at Luigis a
little Italian restaurant on the lower West Side We had known the place
well in our student days and had made a point of visiting it once a
month since in order to keep in practice in the fine art of gracefully
handling long shreds of spaghetti Therefore we did not think it strange
when the proprietor himself stopped a moment at our table to greet
us Glancing furtively around at the other diners mostly Italians he
suddenly leaned over and whispered to Kennedy

I have heard of your wonderful detective work Professor Could you
give a little advice in the case of a friend of mine

Surely Luigi What is the case asked Craig leaning back in his
chair

Luigi glanced around again apprehensively and lowered his voice Not
so loud sir When you pay your check go out walk around Washington
Square and come in at the private entrance Ill be waiting in the
hall My friend is dining privately upstairs

We lingered a while over our Chianti then quietly paid the check and
departed

True to his word Luigi was waiting for us in the dark hall With a
motion that indicated silence he led us up the stairs to the second
floor and quickly opened a door into what seemed to be a fairsized
private diningroom A man was pacing the floor nervously On a table
was some food untouched As the door opened I thought he started as if
in fear and I am sure his dark face blanched if only for an instant
Imagine our surprise at seeing Gennaro the great tenor with whom
merely to have a speaking acquaintance was to argue oneself famous

Oh it is you Luigi he exclaimed in perfect English rich and
mellow And who are these gentlemen

Luigi merely replied Friends in English also and then dropped off
into a voluble lowtoned explanation in Italian

I could see as we waited that the same idea had flashed over Kennedys
mind as over my own It was now three or four days since the papers
had reported the strange kidnapping of Gennaros fiveyearold daughter
Adelina his only child and the sending of a demand for ten thousand
dollars ransom signed as usual with the mystic Black Handa name to
conjure with in blackmail and extortion

As Signor Gennaro advanced toward us after his short talk with Luigi
almost before the introductions were over Kennedy anticipated him by
saying I understand Signor before you ask me I have read all about
it in the papers You want someone to help you catch the criminals who
are holding your little girl

No no exclaimed Gennaro excitedly Not that I want to get my
daughter first After that catch them if you canyes I should like
to have someone do it But read this first and tell me what you think
of it How should I act to get my little Adelina back without harming a
hair of her head The famous singer drew from a capacious pocketbook a
dirty crumpled letter scrawled on cheap paper

Kennedy translated it quickly It read

Honourable sir Your daughter is in safe hands But by the saints if
you give this letter to the police as you did the other not only she
but your family also someone near to you will suffer We will not fail
as we did Wednesday If you want your daughter back go yourself alone
and without telling a soul to Enrico Albanos Saturday night at the
twelfth hour You must provide yourself with 10000 in bills hidden in
Saturdays Il Progresso Italiano In the back room you will see a man
sitting alone at a table He will have a red flower on his coat You
are to say A fine opera is I Pagliacci If he answers Not without
Gennaro lay the newspaper down on the table He will pick it up
leaving his own the Bolletino On the third page you will find
written the place where your daughter has been left waiting for you
Go immediately and get her But by the God if you have so much as the
shadow of the police near Enricos your daughter will be sent to you in
a box that night Do not fear to come We pledge our word to deal fairly
if you deal fairly This is a last warning Lest you shall forget we
will show one other sign of our power tomorrow La MANO NERA

The end of this ominous letter was gruesomely decorated with a skull
and crossbones a rough drawing of a dagger thrust through a bleeding
heart a coffin and under all a huge black hand There was no doubt
about the type of letter that it was It was such as have of late years
become increasingly common in all our large cities baffling the best
detectives

You have not showed this to the police I presume asked Kennedy

Naturally not

Are you going Saturday night

I am afraid to go and afraid to stay away was the reply and the
voice of the fiftythousanddollarsaseason tenor was as human as that
of a fivedollaraweek father for at bottom all men high or low are
one

We will not fail as we did Wednesday reread Craig What does that
mean

Gennaro fumbled in his pocketbook again and at last drew forth a
typewritten letter bearing the letterhead of the Leslie Laboratories
Incorporated

After I received the first threat explained Gennaro my wife and
I went from our apartments at the hotel to her fathers the banker
Cesare you know who lives on Fifth Avenue I gave the letter to the
Italian Squad of the police The next morning my fatherinlaws butler
noticed something peculiar about the milk He barely touched some of it
to his tongue and he has been violently ill ever since I at once
sent the milk to the laboratory of my friend Doctor Leslie to have it
analysed This letter shows what the household escaped

My dear Gennaro read Kennedy The milk submitted to us for
examination on the 10th inst has been carefully analysed and I beg to
hand you herewith the result

 Specific gravity 1036 at 15 degrees Cent

 Water 8460 per cent
 Casein 349  
 Albumin 56  
 Globulin 32  
 Lactose 508

 Ricin 119  

Ricin is a new and littleknown poison derived from the shell of the
castoroil bean Professor Ehrlich states that one gram of the pure
poison will kill 1500000 guinea pigs Ricin was lately isolated by
Professor Robert of Rostock but is seldom found except in an impure
state though still very deadly It surpasses strychnine prussic acid
and other commonly known drugs I congratulate you and yours on escaping
and shall of course respect your wishes absolutely regarding keeping
secret this attempt on your life Believe me

Very sincerely yours

C W LESLIE


As Kennedy handed the letter back he remarked significantly I can see
very readily why you dont care to have the police figure in your case
It has got quite beyond ordinary police methods

And tomorrow too they are going to give another sign of their
power groaned Gennaro sinking into the chair before his untasted
food

You say you have left your hotel inquired Kennedy

Yes My wife insisted that we would be more safely guarded at the
residence of her father the banker But we are afraid even there since
the poison attempt So I have come here secretly to Luigi my old
friend Luigi who is preparing food for us and in a few minutes one
of Cesares automobiles will be here and I will take the food up to
hersparing no expense or trouble She is heartbroken It will kill
her Professor Kennedy if anything happens to our little Adelina

Ah sir I am not poor myself A months salary at the operahouse
that is what they ask of me Gladly would I give it ten thousand
dollarsall if they asked it of my contract with Herr Schleppencour
the director But the policebahthey are all for catching the
villains What good will it do me if they catch them and my little
Adelina is returned to me dead It is all very well for the AngloSaxon
to talk of justice and the law but I amwhat you call itan
emotional Latin I want my little daughterand at any cost Catch the
villains afterwardyes I will pay double then to catch them so that
they cannot blackmail me again Only first I want my daughter back

And your fatherinlaw

My fatherinlaw he has been among you long enough to be one of you
He has fought them He has put up a sign in his bankinghouse No money
paid on threats But I say it is foolish I do not know America as well
as he but I know this the police never succeedthe ransom is paid
without their knowledge and they very often take the credit I say pay
first then I will swear a righteous vendettaI will bring the dogs to
justice with the money yet on them Only show me how show me how

First of all replied Kennedy I want you to answer one question
truthfully without reservation as to a friend I am your friend
believe me Is there any person a relative or acquaintance of yourself
or your wife or your fatherinlaw whom you even have reason to suspect
of being capable of extorting money from you in this way I neednt say
that that is the experience of the district attorneys office in the
large majority of cases of this socalled Black Hand

No replied the tenor without hesitation I know that and I have
thought about it No I can think of no one I know you Americans often
speak of the Black Hand as a myth coined originally by a newspaper
writer Perhaps it has no organisation But Professor Kennedy to me
it is no myth What if the real Black Hand is any gang of criminals who
choose to use that convenient name to extort money Is it the less real
My daughter is gone

Exactly agreed Kennedy It is not a theory that confronts you It is
a hard cold fact I understand that perfectly What is the address of
this Albanos

Luigi mentioned a number on Mulberry Street and Kennedy made a note of
it

It is a gambling saloon explained Luigi Albano is a Neapolitan
a Camorrista one of my countrymen of whom I am thoroughly ashamed
Professor Kennedy

Do you think this Albano had anything to do with the letter

Luigi shrugged his shoulders

Just then a big limousine was heard outside Luigi picked up a huge
hamper that was placed in a corner of the room and followed closely by
Signor Gennaro hurried down to it As the tenor left us he grasped our
hands in each of his

I have an idea in my mind said Craig simply I will try to think it
out in detail tonight Where can I find you tomorrow

Come to me at the operahouse in the afternoon or if you want me
sooner at Mr Cesares residence Good night and a thousand thanks
to you Professor Kennedy and to you also Mr Jameson I trust you
absolutely because Luigi trusts you

We sat in the little diningroom until we heard the door of the
limousine bang shut and the car shoot off with the rattle of the
changing gears

One more question Luigi said Craig as the door opened again I have
never been on that block in Mulberry Street where this Albanos is Do
you happen to know any of the shopkeepers on it or near it

I have a cousin who has a drugstore on the corner below Albanos on
the same side of the street

Good Do you think he would let me use his store for a few minutes
Saturday nightof course without any risk to himself

I think I could arrange it

Very well Then tomorrow say at nine in the morning I will stop
here and we will all go over to see him Good night Luigi and many
thanks for thinking of me in connection with this case Ive enjoyed
Signor Gennaros singing often enough at the opera to want to render him
this service and Im only too glad to be able to be of service to all
honest Italians that is if I succeed in carrying out a plan I have in
mind

A little before nine the following day Kennedy and I dropped into
Luigis again Kennedy was carrying a suitcase which he had taken over
from his laboratory to our rooms the night before Luigi was waiting for
us and without losing a minute we sallied forth

By means of the tortuous twists of streets in old Greenwich village
we came out at last on Bleecker Street and began walking east amid
the hurlyburly of races of lower New York We had not quite reached
Mulberry Street when our attention was attracted by a large crowd on
one of the busy corners held back by a cordon of police who were
endeavouring to keep the people moving with that burly good nature
which the sixfoot Irish policeman displays toward the fivefoot
burdenbearers of southern and eastern Europe who throng New York

Apparently we saw as we edged up into the front of the crowd here was
a building whose whole front had literally been torn off and wrecked
The thick plateglass of the windows was smashed to a mass of greenish
splinters on the sidewalk while the windows of the upper floors and
for several houses down the block in either street were likewise broken
Some thick iron bars which had formerly protected the windows were now
bent and twisted A huge hole yawned in the floor inside the doorway
and peering in we could see the desks and chairs a tangled mass of
kindling

Whats the matter I inquired of an officer near me displaying my
reporters fireline badge more for its moral effect than in the hope
of getting any real information in these days of enforced silence toward
the press

Black Hand bomb was the laconic reply

Whew I whistled Anyone hurt

They dont usually kill anyone do they asked the officer by way of
reply to test my acquaintance with such things

No I admitted They destroy more property than lives But did they
get anyone this time This must have been a thoroughly overloaded bomb
I should judge by the looks of things

Came pretty close to it The bank hadnt any more than opened when
bang went this gaspipeanddynamite thing Crowd collected before the
smoke had fairly cleared Man who owns the bank was hurt but not badly
Now come beat it down to headquarters if you want to find out any
moreYoull find it printed on the pink slipsthe squeal bookby
this time Gainst the rules for me to talk he added with a
goodnatured grin then to the crowd Gwan now Youre blockin
traffic Keep movin

I turned to Craig and Luigi Their eyes were riveted on the big gilt
sign half broken and all askew overhead It read

 CIRO DI CESARE  Co BANKERS

 NEW YORK GENOA NAPLES ROME PALERMO

This is the reminder so that Gennaro and his fatherinlaw will not
forget I gasped

Yes added Craig pulling us away and Cesare himself is wounded
too Perhaps that was for putting up the notice refusing to pay Perhaps
not Its a queer casethey usually set the bombs off at night when
no one is around There must be more back of this than merely to scare
Gennaro It looks to me as if they were after Casare too first by
poison then by dynamite

We shouldered our way out through the crowd and went on until we came to
Mulberry Street pulsing with life Down we went past the little shops
dodging the children and making way for women with huge bundles of
sweatshop clothing accurately balanced on their heads or hugged up under
their capacious capes Here was just one little colony of the hundreds
of thousands of Italiansa population larger than the Italian
population of Romeof whose life the rest of New York knew and cared
nothing

At last we came to Albanos little wineshop a dark evil malodorous
place on the street level of a fivestory alleged newlaw tenement
Without hesitation Kennedy entered and we followed acting the part of
a slumming party There were a few customers at this early hour men out
of employment and an inoffensivelooking lot though of course they eyed
us sharply Albano himself proved to be a greasy lowbrowed fellow who
had a sort of cunning look I could well imagine such a fellow spreading
terror in the hearts of simple folk by merely pressing both temples with
his thumbs and drawing his long bony forefinger under his throatthe
socalled Black Hand sign that has shut up many a witness in the middle
of his testimony even in open court

We pushed through to the lowceilinged back room which was empty and
sat down at a table Over a bottle of Albanos famous California red
ink we sat silently Kennedy was making a mental note of the place In
the middle of the ceiling was a single gasburner with a big reflector
over it In the back wall of the room was a horizontal oblong window
barred and with a sash that opened like a transom The tables were
dirty and the chairs rickety The walls were bare and unfinished with
beams innocent of decoration Altogether it was as unprepossessing a
place as I had ever seen

Apparently satisfied with his scrutiny Kennedy got up to go
complimenting the proprietor on his wine I could see that Kennedy had
made up his mind as to his course of action

How sordid crime really is he remarked as we walked on down the
street Look at that place of Albanos I defy even the police news
reporter on the Star to find any glamour in that

Our next stop was at the corner at the little store kept by the cousin
of Luigi who conducted us back of the partition where prescriptions
were compounded and found us chairs

A hurried explanation from Luigi brought a cloud to the open face of the
druggist as if he hesitated to lay himself and his little fortune open
to the blackmailers Kennedy saw it and interrupted

All that I wish to do he said is to put in a little instrument here
and use it tonight for a few minutes Indeed there will be no risk to
you Vincenzo Secrecy is what I desire and no one will ever know about
it

Vincenzo was at length convinced and Craig opened his suitcase There
was little in it except several coils of insulated wire some tools a
couple of packages wrapped up and a couple of pairs of overalls In a
moment Kennedy had donned overalls and was smearing dirt and grease over
his face and hands Under his direction I did the same

Taking the bag of tools the wire and one of the small packages we
went out on the street and then up through the dark and illventilated
hall of the tenement Halfway up a woman stopped us suspiciously

Telephone company said Craig curtly Heres permission from the
owner of the house to string wires across the roof

He pulled an old letter out of his pocket but as it was too dark to
read even if the woman had cared to do so we went on up as he had
expected unmolested At last we came to the roof where there were some
children at play a couple of houses down from us

Kennedy began by dropping two strands of wire down to the ground in the
back yard behind Vincenzos shop Then he proceeded to lay two wires
along the edge of the roof

We had worked only a little while when the children began to collect
However Kennedy kept right on until we reached the tenement next to
that in which Albanos shop was

Walter he whispered just get the children away for a minute now

Look here you kids I yelled some of you will fall off if you get
so close to the edge of the roof Keep back

It had no effect Apparently they looked not a bit frightened at the
dizzy mass of clotheslines below us

Say is there a candystore on this block I asked in desperation

Yes sir came the chorus

Wholl go down and get me a bottle of ginger ale I asked

A chorus of voices and glittering eyes was the answer They all would I
took a halfdollar from my pocket and gave it to the oldest

All right now hustle along and divide the change

With the scamper of many feet they were gone and we were alone Kennedy
had now reached Albanos and as soon as the last head had disappeared
below the scuttle of the roof he dropped two long strands down into the
back yard as he had done at Vincenzos

I started to go back but he stopped me

Oh that will never do he said The kids will see that the wires end
here I must carry them on several houses farther as a blind and trust
to luck that they dont see the wires leading down below

We were several houses down still putting up wires when the crowd came
shouting back sticky with cheap trustmade candy and black with East
Side chocolate We opened the ginger ale and forced ourselves to drink
it so as to excite no suspicion then a few minutes later descended the
stairs of the tenement coming out just above Albanos

I was wondering how Kennedy was going to get into Albanos again without
exciting suspicion He solved it neatly

Now Walter do you think you could stand another dip into that red ink
of Albanos

I said I might in the interests of science and justicenot otherwise

Well your face is sufficiently dirty he commented so that with the
overalls you dont look very much as you did the first time you went in
I dont think they will recognise you Do I look pretty good

You look like a coalheaver out of a job I said I can scarcely
restrain my admiration

All right Then take this little glass bottle Go into the back room
and order something cheap in keeping with your looks Then when you are
all alone break the bottle It is full of gas drippings Your nose
will dictate what to do next Just tell the proprietor you saw the gas
companys wagon on the next block and come up here and tell me

I entered There was a sinisterlooking man with a sort of unscrupulous
intelligence writing at a table As he wrote and puffed at his cigar
I noticed a scar on his face a deep furrow running from the lobe of his
ear to his mouth That I knew was a brand set upon him by the Camorra
I sat and smoked and sipped slowly for several minutes cursing him
inwardly more for his presence than for his evident look of the mala
vita At last he went out to ask the barkeeper for a stamp

Quickly I tiptoed over to another corner of the room and ground the
little bottle under my heel Then I resumed my seat The odour that
pervaded the room was sickening

The sinisterlooking man with the scar came in again and sniffed I
sniffed Then the proprietor came in and sniffed

Say I said in the toughest voice I could assume you got a leak
Wait I seen the gas company wagon on the next block when I came in
Ill get the man

I dashed out and hurried up the street to the place where Kennedy was
waiting impatiently Rattling his tools he followed me with apparent
reluctance

As he entered the wineshop he snorted after the manner of gasmen
Wheres de leak

You finda da leak grunted Albano Whata you geta you pay for You
wanta me do your work

Well half a dozen o you wops get out o here thats all Dyouse
all wanter be blown ter pieces wid dem pipes and cigarettes Clear out
growled Kennedy

They retreated precipitately and Craig hastily opened his bag of tools

Quick Walter shut the door and hold it exclaimed Craig working
rapidly He unwrapped a little package and took out a round flat
disclike thing of black vulcanised rubber Jumping up on a table he
fixed it to the top of the reflector over the gasjet

Can you see that from the floor Walter he asked under his breath

No I replied not even when I know it is there

Then he attached a couple of wires to it and led them across the ceiling
toward the window concealing them carefully by sticking them in the
shadow of a beam At the window he quickly attached the wires to the
two that were dangling down from the roof and shoved them around out of
sight

Well have to trust that no one sees them he said Thats the best I
can do at such short notice I never saw a room so bare as this anyway
There isnt another place I could put that thing without its being
seen

We gathered up the broken glass of the gas drippings bottle and I
opened the door

Its all right now said Craig sauntering out before the bar Only
de next time you has anyting de matter call de company up I aint
supposed to do dis witout orders see

A moment later I followed glad to get out of the oppressive atmosphere
and joined him in the back of Vincenzos drugstore where he was again
at work As there was no back window there it was quite a job to lead
the wires around the outside from the back yard and in at a side window
It was at last done however without exciting suspicion and Kennedy
attached them to an oblong box of weathered oak and a pair of specially
constructed dry batteries

Now said Craig as we washed off the stains of work and stowed the
overalls back in the suitcase that is done to my satisfaction I can
tell Gennaro to go ahead safely now and meet the BlackHanders

From Vincenzos we walked over toward Centre Street where Kennedy and
I left Luigi to return to his restaurant with instructions to be at
Vincenzos at halfpast eleven that night

We turned into the new police headquarters and went down the long
corridor to the Italian Bureau Kennedy sent in his card to Lieutenant
Giuseppe in charge and we were quickly admitted The lieutenant was a
short fullfaced fleshy Italian with lightish hair and eyes that were
apparently dull until you suddenly discovered that that was merely a
cover to their really restless way of taking in everything and fixing
the impressions on his mind as if on a sensitive plate

I want to talk about the Gennaro case began Craig I may add that
I have been rather closely associated with Inspector OConnor of the
Central Office on a number of cases so that I think we can trust each
other Would you mind telling me what you know about it if I promise you
that I too have something to reveal

The lieutenant leaned back and watched Kennedy closely without seeming
to do so When I was in Italy last year he replied at length I did
a good deal of work in tracing up some Camorra suspects I had a tip
about some of them to look up their recordsI neednt say where it came
from but it was a good one Much of the evidence against some of those
fellows who are being tried at Viterbo was gathered by the Carabinieri
as a result of hints that I was able to give themclues that were
furnished to me here in America from the source I speak of I suppose
there is really no need to conceal it though The original tip came
from a certain banker here in New York

I can guess who it was nodded Craig

Then as you know this banker is a fighter He is the man who
organised the White Handan organisation which is trying to rid the
Italian population of the Black Hand His society had a lot of evidence
regarding former members of both the Camorra in Naples and the Mafia in
Sicily as well as the Black Hand gangs in New York Chicago and other
cities Well Cesare as you know is Gennaros fatherinlaw

While I was in Naples looking up the record of a certain criminal I
heard of a peculiar murder committed some years ago There was an honest
old music master who apparently lived the quietest and most harmless
of lives But it became known that he was supported by Cesare and had
received handsome presents of money from him The old man was as
you may have guessed the first music teacher of Gennaro the man who
discovered him One might have been at a loss to see how he could have
an enemy but there was one who coveted his small fortune One day he
was stabbed and robbed His murderer ran out into the street crying
out that the poor man had been killed Naturally a crowd rushed up in
a moment for it was in the middle of the day Before the injured man
could make it understood who had struck him the assassin was down the
street and lost in the maze of old Naples where he well knew the
houses of his friends who would hide him The man who is known to have
committed that crimeFrancesco Paoliescaped to New York We are
looking for him today He is a clever man far above the averageson
of a doctor in a town a few miles from Naples went to the university
was expelled for some mad prankin short he was the black sheep of the
family Of course over here he is too highborn to work with his
hands on a railroad or in a trench and not educated enough to work
at anything else So he has been preying on his more industrious
countrymena typical case of a man living by his wits with no visible
means of support

Now I dont mind telling you in strict confidence continued the
lieutenant that its my theory that old Cesare has seen Paoli here
knew he was wanted for that murder of the old music master and gave me
the tip to look up his record At any rate Paoli disappeared right after
I returned from Italy and we havent been able to locate him since
He must have found out in some way that the tip to look him up had been
given by the White Hand He had been a Camorrista in Italy and had
many ways of getting information here in America

He paused and balanced a piece of cardboard in his hand

It is my theory of this case that if we could locate this Paoli we
could solve the kidnapping of little Adelina Gennaro very quickly
Thats his picture

Kennedy and I bent over to look at it and I started in surprise It was
my evillooking friend with the scar on his cheek

Well said Craig quietly handing back the card whether or not he is
the man I know where we can catch the kidnappers tonight Lieutenant

It was Giuseppes turn to show surprise now

With your assistance Ill get this man and the whole gang tonight
explained Craig rapidly sketching over his plan and concealing just
enough to make sure that no matter how anxious the lieutenant was to get
the credit he could not spoil the affair by premature interference

The final arrangement was that four of the best men of the squad were to
hide in a vacant store across from Vincenzos early in the evening long
before anyone was watching The signal for them to appear was to be
the extinguishing of the lights behind the coloured bottles in the
druggists window A taxicab was to be kept waiting at headquarters
at the same time with three other good men ready to start for a given
address the moment the alarm was given over the telephone

We found Gennaro awaiting us with the greatest anxiety at the
operahouse The bomb at Cesares had been the last straw Gennaro had
already drawn from his bank ten crisp onethousanddollar bills and
already had a copy of Il Progresso in which he had hidden the money
between the sheets

Mr Kennedy he said I am going to meet them tonight They may kill
me See I have provided myself with a pistolI shall fight too if
necessary for my little Adelina But if it is only money they want they
shall have it

One thing I want to say began Kennedy

No no no cried the tenor I will goyou shall not stop me

I dont wish to stop you Craig reassured him But one thingdo
exactly as I tell you and I swear not a hair of the childs head will
be injured and we will get the blackmailers too

How eagerly asked Gennaro What do you want me to do

All I want you to do is to go to Albanos at the appointed time Sit
down in the back room Get into conversation with them and above all
Signor as soon as you get the copy of the Bolletino turn to the third
page pretend not to be able to read the address Ask the man to read
it Then repeat it after him Pretend to be overjoyed Offer to set up
wine for the whole crowd Just a few minutes that is all I ask and I
will guarantee that you will be the happiest man in New York tomorrow

Gennaros eyes filled with tears as he grasped Kennedys hand That is
better than having the whole police force back of me he said I shall
never forget never forget

As we went out Kennedy remarked You cant blame them for keeping their
troubles to themselves Here we send a police officer over to Italy to
look up the records of some of the worst suspects He loses his life
Another takes his place Then after he gets back he is set to work on
the mere clerical routine of translating them One of his associates is
reduced in rank And so what does it come to Hundreds of records have
become useless because the three years within which the criminals could
be deported have elapsed with nothing done Intelligent isnt it
I believe it has been established that all but about fifty of seven
hundred known Italian suspects are still at large mostly in this city
And the rest of the Italian population is guarded from them by a squad
of police in number scarcely onethirtieth of the number of known
criminals No its our fault if the Black Hand thrives

We had been standing on the corner of Broadway waiting for a car

Now Walter dont forget Meet me at the Bleecker Street station of
the subway at eleventhirty Im off to the university I have some very
important experiments with phosphorescent salts that I want to finish
today

What has that to do with the case I asked mystified

Nothing replied Craig I didnt say it had At eleventhirty dont
forget By George though that Paoli must be a clever onethink of his
knowing about ricin I only heard of it myself recently Well heres my
car Goodbye

Craig swung aboard an Amsterdam Avenue car leaving me to kill eight
nervous hours of my weekly day of rest from the Star

They passed at length and at precisely the appointed time Kennedy and I
met With suppressed excitement at least on my part we walked over to
Vincenzos At night this section of the city was indeed a black enigma
The lights in the shops where olive oil fruit and other things were
sold were winking out one by one here and there strains of music
floated out of wineshops and little groups lingered on corners
conversing in animated sentences We passed Albanos on the other side
of the street being careful not to look at it too closely for several
men were hanging idly aboutpickets apparently with some secret code
that would instantly have spread far and wide the news of any alarming
action

At the corner we crossed and looked in Vincenzos window a moment
casting a furtive glance across the street at the dark empty store where
the police must be hiding Then we went in and casually sauntered back
of the partition Luigi was there already There were several customers
still in the store however and therefore we had to sit in silence
while Vincenzo quickly finished a prescription and waited on the last
one

At last the doors were locked and the lights lowered all except those
in the windows which were to serve as signals

Ten minutes to twelve said Kennedy placing the oblong box on the
table Gennaro will be going in soon Let us try this machine now and
see if it works If the wires have been cut since we put them up this
morning Gennaro will have to take his chances alone

Kennedy reached over and with a light movement of his forefinger touched
a switch

Instantly a babel of voices filled the store all talking at once
rapidly and loudly Here and there we could distinguish a snatch of
conversation a word a phrase now and then even a whole sentence above
the rest There was the clink of glasses I could hear the rattle of
dice on a bare table and an oath A cork popped Somebody scratched a
match

We sat bewildered looking at Kennedy for an explanation

Imagine that you are sitting at a table in Albanos back room was
all he said This is what you would be hearing This is my electric
earin other words the dictograph used I am told by the Secret
Service of the United States Wait in a moment you will hear Gennaro
come in Luigi and Vincenzo translate what you hear My knowledge of
Italian is pretty rusty

Can they hear us whispered Luigi in an awestruck whisper

Craig laughed No not yet But I have only to touch this other switch
and I could produce an effect in that room that would rival the famous
writing on Belshazzars wallonly it would be a voice from the wall
instead of writing

They seem to be waiting for someone said Vincenzo I heard somebody
say He will be here in a few minutes Now get out

The babel of voices seemed to calm down as men withdrew from the room
Only one or two were left

One of them says the child is all right She has been left in the back
yard translated Luigi

What yard Did he say asked Kennedy

No they just speak of it as the yard replied Luigi

Jameson go outside in the store to the telephone booth and call up
headquarters Ask them if the automobile is ready with the men in it

I rang up and after a moment the police central answered that
everything was right

Then tell central to hold the line clearwe mustnt lose a moment
Jameson you stay in the booth Vincenzo you pretend to be working
around your window but not in such a way as to attract attention for
they have men watching the street very carefully What is it Luigi

Gennaro is coming I just heard one of them say Here he comes

Even from the booth I could hear the dictograph repeating the
conversation in the dingy little back room of Albanos down the
street

Hes ordering a bottle of red wine murmured Luigi dancing up and
down with excitement

Vincenzo was so nervous that he knocked a bottle down in the window
and I believe that my heartbeats were almost audible over the telephone
which I was holding for the police operator called me down for asking
so many times if all was ready

There it isthe signal cried Craig A fine opera is
I Pagliacci Now listen for the answer

A moment elapsed then Not without Gennaro came a gruff voice in
Italian from the dictograph

A silence ensued It was tense

Wait wait said a voice which I recognised instantly as Gennaros I
cannot read this What is this 23 Prince Street

No 33 She has been left in the backyard answered the voice

Jameson called Craig tell them to drive straight to 33 Prince
Street They will find the girl in the back yardquick before the
BlackHanders have a chance to go back on their word

I fairly shouted my orders to the police headquarters Theyre off
came back the answer and I hung up the receiver

What was that Craig was asking of Luigi I didnt catch it What did
they say

That other voice said to Gennaro Sit down while I count this

Sh hes talking again

If it is a penny less than ten thousand or I find a mark on the bills
Ill call to Enrico and your daughter will be spirited away again
translated Luigi

Now Gennaro is talking said Craig Goodhe is gaining time He is
a trump I can distinguish that all right Hes asking the gruff voiced
fellow if he will have another bottle of wine He says he will Good
They must be at Prince Street now well give them a few minutes more
not too much for word will be back to Albanos like wildfire and they
will get Gennaro after all Ah they are drinking again What was that
Luigi The money is all right he says Now Vincenzo out with the
lights

A door banged open across the street and four huge dark figures darted
out in the direction of Albanos

With his finger Kennedy pulled down the other switch and shouted
Gennaro this is Kennedy To the street Polizia Polizia

A scuffle and a cry of surprise followed A second voice apparently
from the bar shouted Out with the lights out with the lights

Bang went a pistol and another

The dictograph which had been all sound a moment before was as mute as
a cigarbox

Whats the matter I asked Kennedy as he rushed past me

They have shot out the lights My receiving instrument is destroyed
Come on Jameson Vincenzo stay back if you dont want to appear in
this

A short figure rushed by me faster even than I could go It was the
faithful Luigi

In front of Albanos an exciting fight was going on Shots were being
fired wildly in the darkness and heads were popping out of tenement
windows on all sides As Kennedy and I flung ourselves into the crowd
we caught a glimpse of Gennaro with blood streaming from a cut on his
shoulder struggling with a policeman while Luigi vainly was trying to
interpose himself between them A man held by another policeman was
urging the first officer on Thats the man he was crying Thats
the kidnapper I caught him

In a moment Kennedy was behind him Paoli you lie You are the
kidnapper Seize himhe has the money on him That other is Gennaro
himself

The policeman released the tenor and both of them seized Paoli The
others were beating at the door which was being frantically barricaded
inside

Just then a taxicab came swinging up they street Three men jumped
out and added their strength to those who were battering down Albanos
barricade

Gennaro with a cry leaped into the taxicab Over his shoulder I could
see a tangled mass of dark brown curls and a childish voice lisped Why
didnt you come for me papa The bad man told me if I waited in the
yard you would come for me But if I cried he said he would shoot me
And I waited and waited

There there Una papas going to take you straight home to mother

A crash followed as the door yielded and the famous Paoli gang was in
the hands of the law




XI The Artificial Paradise

It was I recall at that period of the late unpleasantness in the
little Central American republic of Vespuccia when things looked
darkest for American investors that I hurried home one evening to
Kennedy bursting with news

By way of explanation I may add that during the rubber boom Kennedy had
invested in stock of a rubber company in Vespuccia and that its value
had been shrinking for some time with that elasticity which a rubber
band shows when one party suddenly lets go his end Kennedy had been in
danger of being snapped rather hard by the recoil and I knew he had
put in an order with his broker to sell and take his loss when a certain
figure was reached My news was a first ray of light in an otherwise
dark situation and I wanted to advise him to cancel the selling order
and stick for a rise

Accordingly I hurried unceremoniously into our apartment with the words
on my lips before I had fairly closed the door What do you think
Craig I shouted It is rumoured that the revolutionists have captured
half a million dollars from the government and are sending it to I
stopped short I had no idea that Kennedy had a client and a girl too

With a hastily mumbled apology I checked myself and backed out toward
my own room I may as well confess that I did not retreat very fast
however Kennedys client was not only a girl but a very pretty one I
found as she turned her head quickly at my sudden entrance and betray
a lively interest at the mention of the revolution She was a
LatinAmerican and the LatinAmerican type of feminine beauty is
fascinating at least to me I did not retreat very fast

As I hoped Kennedy rose to the occasion Miss Guerrero he said let
me introduce Mr Jameson who has helped me very much in solving some of
my most difficult cases Miss Guerreros father Walter is the owner of
a plantation which sells its product to the company I am interested in

She bowed graciously but there was a moment of embarrassment until
Kennedy came to the rescue

I shall need Mr Jameson in handling your case Miss Guerrero he
explained Would it be presuming to ask you to repeat to him briefly
what you have already told me about the mysterious disappearance of your
father Perhaps some additional details will occur to you things that
you may consider trivial but which I assure you may be of the utmost
importance

She assented and in a low tremulous musical voice bravely went
through her story

We come she began my father and Ifor my mother died when I was a
little girlwe come from the northern part of Vespuccia where foreign
capitalists are much interested in the introduction of a new rubber
plant I am an only child and have been the constant companion of my
father for years ever since I could ride a pony going with him about
our hacienda and on business trips to Europe and the States

I may as well say at the start Mr Jameson that although my father is
a large landowner he has very liberal political views and is deeply in
sympathy with the revolution that is now going on in Vespuccia In fact
we were forced to flee very early in the trouble and as there seemed
to be more need of his services here in New York than in any of the
neighbouring countries we came here So you see that if the revolution
is not successful his estate will probably be confiscated and we shall
be penniless He is the agentthe head of the junta I suppose you
would call ithere in New York

Engaged in purchasing arms and ammunition put in Kennedy as she
paused and seeing that they are shipped safely to New Orleans as
agricultural machinery where another agent receives them and attends to
their safe transit across the Gulf

She nodded and after a moment resumed

There is quite a little colony of Vespuccians here in New York both
revolutionists and government supporters I suppose that neither of
you has any idea of the intriguing that is going on under the peaceful
surface right here in your own city But there is much of it more than
even I know or can tell you Well my father lately has been acting very
queerly There is a group who meet frequently at the home of a Senora
Mendezan insurrecto group of course I do not go for they are
all much older people than I I know the senora well but I prefer
a different kind of person My friends are younger and perhaps more
radical more in earnest about the future of Vespuccia

For some weeks it has seemed to me that this Senora Mendez has had too
much influence over my father He does not seem like the same man he
used to be Indeed some of the junta who do not frequent the house of
the senora have remarked it He seems moody works by starts then
will neglect his work entirely Often I see him with his eyes closed
apparently sitting quietly oblivious to the progress of the causethe
only cause now which can restore us our estate

The other day we lost an entire shipment of armsthe Secret Service
captured them on the way from the warehouse on South Street to the
steamer which was to take them to New Orleans Only once before had it
happened when my father did not understand all the things to conceal
Then he was frantic for a week But this time he seems not to care Ah
senores she said dropping her voice I fear there was some treachery
there

Treachery I asked And have you any suspicions who might have played
informer

She hesitated I may as well tell you just what I suspect I fear that
the hold of Senora Mendez is somehow or other concerned with it all I
even have suspected that somehow she may be working in the pay of the
government that she is a vampire living on the secrets of the group who
so trust her I suspect anything everybodythat she is poisoning
his mind perhaps even whispering into his ear some siren proposal of
amnesty and his estate again if he will but do what she asks My poor
fatherI must save him from himself if it is necessary Argument has
no effect with him He merely answers that the senora is a talented
and accomplished woman and laughs a vacant laugh when I hint to him to
beware I hate her

The fiery animosity of her dark eyes boded ill I felt for the senora
But it flashed over me that perhaps after all the senora was not a
traitress but had simply been scheming to win the heart and hence the
hacienda of the great landowner when he came into possession of his
estate if the revolution proved successful

And finally she concluded keeping back the tears by an heroic
effort last night he left our apartment promising to return early in
the evening It is now twentyfour hours and I have heard not a
word from him It is the first time in my life that we have ever been
separated so long

And you have no idea where he could have gone asked Craig

Only what I have learned from Senor Torreon another member of the
junta Senor Torreon said this morning that he left the home of Senora
Mendez last night about ten oclock in company with my father He says
they parted at the subway as they lived on different branches of the
road Professor Kennedy she added springing up and clasping her hands
tightly in an appeal that was irresistible you know what steps to take
to find him I trust all to youeven the calling on the police though
I think it would be best if we could get along without them Find my
father senores and when we come into our own again you shall not
regret that you befriended a lonely girl in a strange city surrounded
by intrigue and danger There were tears in her eyes as she stood
swaying before us

The tenseness of the appeal was broken by the sharp ringing of the
telephone bell Kennedy quickly took down the receiver

Your maid wishes to speak to you he said handing the telephone to
her

Her face brightened with that nervous hope that springs in the human
breast even in the blackest moments I told her if any message came for
me she might find me here explained Miss Guerrero Yes Juanita what
is ita message for me

My Spanish was not quite good enough to catch more than a word here and
there in the low conversation but I could guess from the haggard look
which overspread her delicate face that the news was not encouraging

Oh she cried this is terribleterrible What shall I do Why did I
come here I dont believe it I dont believe it

Dont believe what Miss Guerrero asked Kennedy reassuringly Trust
me

That he stole the moneyoh what am I saying You must not look for
himyou must forget that I have been here No I dont believe it

What money asked Kennedy disregarding her appeal to drop the case
Remember it may be better that we should know it now than the police
later We will respect your confidence

The junta had been notified a few days ago they say that a large
sumfive hundred thousand silver dollarshad been captured from the
government and was on its way to New York to be melted up as bullion at
the subtreasury she answered repeating what she had heard over the
telephone as if in a dream Mr Jameson referred to the rumour when he
came in I was interested for I did not know the public had heard of it
yet The junta has just announced that the money is missing As soon
as the ship docked in Brooklyn this morning an agent appeared with the
proper credentials from my father and a guard and they took the money
away It has not been heard of sinceand they have no word from my
father

Her face was blanched as she realised what the situation was Here she
was setting people to run down her own father if the suspicions of the
other members of the junta were to be credited

Youyou do not think my fatherstole the money she faltered
pitifully Say you do not think so

I think nothing yet replied Kennedy in an even voice The first
thing to do is to find himbefore the detectives of the junta do so

I felt a tingeI must confess itof jealousy as Kennedy stood beside
her clasping her hand in both of his and gazing earnestly down into the
rich flush that now spread over her olive cheeks

Miss Guerrero he said you may trust me implicitly If your father
is alive I will do all that a man can do to find him Let me actfor
the best And he added wheeling quickly toward me I know Mr
Jameson will do likewise

I was pulled two ways at once I believed in Miss Guerrero and yet the
flight of her father and the removal of the bullion swallowed up as
it were instantly without so much as a trace in New Yorklooked very
black for him And yet as she placed her small hand tremblingly in mine
to say goodbye she won another knight to go forth and fight her battle
for her nor do I think that I am more than ordinarily susceptible
either

When she had gone I looked hopelessly at Kennedy How could we find a
missing man in a city of four million people find him without the aid
of the policeperhaps before the police could themselves find him

Kennedy seemed to appreciate my perplexity as though he read my
thoughts The first thing to do is to locate this Senor Torreon from
whom the first information came he remarked as we left the apartment
Miss Guerrero told me that he might possibly be found in an obscure
boardinghouse in the Bronx where several members of the junta live Let
us try anyway

Fortune favoured us to the extent that we did find Torreon at the
address given He made no effort to evade us though I noted that he was
an unprepossessing looking manundersized and a trifle overstout with
an eye that never met yours as you talked with him Whether it was that
he was concealing something or whether he was merely fearful that we
might after all be United States Secret Service men or whether it was
simply a lack of command of English he was uncommonly uncommunicative
at first He repeated sullenly the details of the disappearance of
Guerrero just as we had already heard them

And you simply bade him goodbye as you got on a subway train and that
is the last you ever saw of him repeated Kennedy

Yes he replied

Did he seem to be worried to have anything on his mind to act queerly
in any way asked Kennedy keenly

No came the monosyllabic reply and there was just that shade of
hesitation about it that made me wish we had the apparatus we used in
the Bond case for registering association time Kennedy noticed it and
purposely dropped the line of inquiry in order not to excite Torreons
suspicion

I understand no word has been received from him at the headquarters on
South Street today

None replied Torreon sharply

And you have no idea where he could have gone after you left him last
night

No senor none

This answer was given I thought with suspicious quickness

You do not think that he could be concealed by Senora Mendez then
asked Kennedy quietly

The little man jumped forward with his eyes flashing No he hissed
checking this show of feeling as quickly as he could

Well then observed Kennedy rising slowly I see nothing to do but
to notify the police and have a general alarm sent out

The fire died in the eyes of Torreon Do not do that Senor he
exclaimed Wait at least one day more Perhaps he will appear
Perhaps he has only gone up to Bridgeport to see about some arms and
cartridgeswho can tell No sir do not call in the police I beg
younot yet I myself will search for him It may be I can get some
word some clue If I can I will notify Miss Guerrero immediately

Kennedy turned suddenly Torreon he flashed quickly what do you
suspect about that shipment of half a million silver dollars Where did
it go after it left the wharf

Torreon kept his composure admirably An enigma of a smile flitted over
his mobile features as he shrugged his shoulders Ah he said simply
then you have heard that the money is missing Perhaps Guerrero has not
gone to Bridgeport after all

On condition that I do not notify the police yetwill you take us to
visit Senora Mendez and let us learn from her what she knows of this
strange case

Torreon was plainly cornered He sat for a moment biting his nails
nervously and fidgeting in his chair It shall be as you wish he
assented at length

We are to go continued Kennedy merely as friends of yours you
understand I want to ask questions in my own way and you are not to

Yes yes he agreed Wait I will tell her we are coming and he
reached for the telephone

No interrupted Kennedy I prefer to go with you unexpected Put
down the telephone Otherwise I may as well notify my friend Inspector
OConnor of the Central Office and go up with him

Torreon let the receiver fall back in its socket and I caught just a
glimpse of the look of hate and suspicion which crossed his face as he
turned toward Kennedy When he spoke it was as suavely as if he himself
were the one who had planned this little excursion

It shall be as you wish he said leading the way out to the
crosstown surface cars

Senora Mendez received us politely and we were ushered into a large
musicroom in her apartment There were several people there already
They were seated in easy chairs about the room

One of the ladies was playing on the piano as we entered It was a
curious compositionvery rhythmic with a peculiar thread of monotonous
melody running through it

The playing ceased and all eyes were fixed on us Kennedy kept very
close to Torreon apparently for the purpose of frustrating any attempt
at a whispered conversation with the senora

The guests rose and with courtly politeness bowed as Senora Mendez
presented two friends of Senor Torreon Senor Kennedy and Senor Jameson
We were introduced in turn to Senor and Senora Alvardo Senor Gonzales
Senorita Reyes and the player Senora Barrios

It was a peculiar situation and for want of something better to say I
commented on the curious character of the music we had overheard as we
entered

The senora smiled and was about to speak when a servant entered
bearing a tray full of little cups with a steaming liquid and in a
silver dish some curious round brown disclike buttons about an inch
in diameter and perhaps a quarter of an inch thick Torreon motioned
frantically to the servant to withdraw but Kennedy was too quick for
him Interposing himself between Torreon and the servant he made way
for her to enter

You were speaking of the music replied Senora Mendez to me in rich
full tones Yes it is very curious It is a song of the Kiowa Indians
of New Mexico which Senora Barrios has endeavoured to set to music so
that it can be rendered on the piano Senora Barrios and myself fled
from Vespuccia to Mexico at the start of our revolution and when the
Mexican government ordered us to leave on account of our political
activity we merely crossed the line to the United States in New
Mexico It was there that we ran across this very curious discovery The
monotonous beat of that melody you heard is supposed to represent the
beating of the tomtoms of the Indians during their mescal rites We are
having a mescal evening here whiling away the hours of exile from our
native Vespuccia

Mescal I repeated blankly at first then feeling a nudge from
Kennedy I added hastily Oh yes to be sure I think I have heard of
it Its a Mexican drink is it not I have never had the pleasure of
tasting it or of tasting that other drink pulquepoolkaydid I get
the accent right

I felt another sharper nudge from Kennedy and knew that I had only
made matters worse

Mr Jameson he hastened to remark confounds this mescal of the
Indians with the drink of the same name that is common in Mexico

Oh she laughed to my great relief but this mescal is something
quite different The Mexican drink mescal is made from the magueyplant
and is a frightfully horrid thing that sends the peon out of his senses
and makes him violent Mescal as I mean it is a little shrub a god a
cult a religion

Yes assented Kennedy discovered by those same Kiowa Indians was it
not

Perhaps she admitted raising her beautiful shoulders in polite
deprecation The mescal religion we found has spread very largely in
New Mexico and Arizona among the Indians and with the removal of the
Kiowas to the Indian reservation it has been adopted by other tribes
even I have heard as far north as the Canadian border

Is that so asked Kennedy I understood that the United States
government had forbidden the importation of the mescal plant and its
sale to the Indians under severe penalties

It has sir interposed Alvardo who had joined us but still the
mescal cult grows secretly For my part I think it might be more wise
for your authorities to look to the whiskey and beer that unscrupulous
persons are selling Senor Jameson he added turning to me will
you join us in a little cup of this artificial paradise as one of your
English writersHavelock Ellis I thinkhas appropriately called it

I glanced dubiously at Kennedy as Senora Mendez took one of the little
buttons out of the silver tray Carefully paring the fuzzy tuft of hairs
off the top of itit looked to me very much like the tip of a cactus
plant which indeed it wasshe rolled it into a little pellet and
placed it in her mouth chewing it slowly like a piece of chicle

Watch me do just as I do whispered Kennedy to me at a moment when no
one was looking

The servant advanced towards us with the tray

The mescal plant explained Alvardo pointing at the little discs
grows precisely like these little buttons which you see here It is a
species of cactus which rises only half an inch or so from the ground
The stem is surrounded by a clump of blunt leaves which give it its
button shape and on the top you will see still the tuft of filaments
like a cactus It grows in the rocky soil in many places in the state
of Jalisco though only recently has it become known to science The
Indians when they go out to gather it simply lop off these little ends
as they peep above the earth dry them keep what they wish for their
own use and sell the rest for what is to them a fabulous sum Some
people chew the buttons while a few have lately tried making an
infusion or tea out of them Perhaps to a beginner I had better
recommend the infusion

I had scarcely swallowed the bitter almost nauseous decoction than I
began to feel my heart action slowing up and my pulse beating fuller and
stronger The pupils of my eyes expanded as with a dose of belladonna
at least I could see that Kennedys did and so mine must have done the
same

I seemed to feel an elated sense of superiorityreally I almost
began to feel that it was I not Kennedy who counted most in this
investigation I have since learned that this is the common experience
of mescalusers this sense of elation but the feeling of physical
energy and intellectual power soon wore off and I found myself glad to
recline in my easy chair as the rest did in silent indolence

Still the display that followed for an enchanted hour or so was such as
I find it hopeless to describe in language which shall convey to others
the beauty and splendour of what I saw

I picked up a book lying on the table before me A pale blueviolet
shadow floated across the page before me leaving an afterimage of pure
colour that was indescribable I laid down the book and closed my eyes
A confused riot of images and colours like a kaleidoscope crowded before
me at first indistinct but as I gazed with closed yes more and more
definite Golden and red and green jewels seemed to riot before me I
bathed my hands in inconceivable riches of beauty such as no artglass
worker has ever produced All discomfort ceased I had no desire to
sleepin fact was hypersensitive But it was a real effort to open
my eyes to tear myself away from the fascinating visions of shapes and
colours

At last I did open my eyes to gaze at the gasjets of the chandelier
as they flickered They seemed to send out waves expanding and
contracting waves of colour The shadows of the room were highly
coloured and constantly changing as the light changed

Senora Barrios began lightly to play on the piano the transposed Kiowa
song emphasising the notes that represented the drumbeats Strange
as it may seem the music translated itself into pure colourand the
rhythmic beating of the time seemed to aid the process I thought of the
untutored Indians as they sat in groups about the flickering campfire
while others beat the tomtoms and droned the curious melody What were
the visions of the red man I wondered as he chewed his mescal button
and the medicine man prayed to Hikori the cactus god to grant a
beautiful intoxication

Under the gaslights of the chandelier hung a cluster of electric light
bulbs which added to the flood of golden effulgence that bathed the room
and all things in it I gazed next intently at the electric lights They
became the sun itself in their steadiness until I had to turn away my
head and close my eyes Even then the image persistedI saw the golden
sands of Newport only they were blazing with glory as if they were
veritable diamond dust I saw the waves of incomparable blue rolling
up on the shore A vague perfume was wafted on the air I was in an orgy
of vision Yet there was no stage of maudlin emotion It was at least
elevating

Kennedys experiences as he related them to me afterwards were similar
though sufficiently varied to be interesting His visions took the forms
of animalsa Cheshire cat like that in Alice in Wonderland with
merely a grin that faded away changing into a lynx which in turn
disappeared followed by an unknown creature with short nose and pointed
ears then tortoises and guineapigs a perfectly unrelated succession
of beasts When the playing began a beautiful panorama unfolded before
himthe regular notes in the music enhancing the beauty and changes in
the scenes which he described as a most wonderful kinetoscopic display

In fact only De Quincey or Bayard Taylor or Poe could have done justice
to the thrilling effects of the drug and not even they unless an
amanuensis had been seated by them to take down what they dictated for
I defy anyone to remember anything but a fraction of the rapid march of
changes under its influence Indeed in observing its action I almost
forgot for the time being the purpose of our visit so fascinated was I
The music ceased but not the visions

Senora Mendez advanced toward us The spangles on her net dress seemed
to give her a fairylike appearance she seemed to float over the carpet
like a glowing fleecy white cloud over a rainbowtinted sky

Kennedy however had not for an instant forgotten what we were there
for and his attention recalled mine I was surprised to see that when
I made the effort I could talk and think quite as rationally as ever
though the wildest pranks were going on in my mind and vision Kennedy
did not beat about in putting his question evidently counting on the
surprise to extract the truth

What time did Senor Guerrero leave last night

The question came so suddenly that she had no time to think of a reply
that would conceal anything she might otherwise have wished to conceal

About ten oclock she answered then instantly was on her guard for
Torreon had caught her eye

And you have no idea where he went asked Kennedy

None unless he went home she replied guardedly

I did not at the time notice the significance of her prompt response
to Torreons warning I did not notice as did Kennedy the smile that
spread over Torreons features The music had started again and I was
oblivious to all but the riot of colour

Again the servant entered She seemed clothed in a halo of light and
colour every fold of her dress radiating the most delicate tones Yet
there was nothing voluptuous or sensual about it I was raised above
earthly things Men and women were no longer men and womenthey were
brilliant creatures of whom I was one It was sensuous but not sensual
I looked at my own clothes My everyday suit was idealised My hands
were surrounded by a glow of red fire that made me feel that they must
be the hands of a divinity I noticed them as I reached forward toward
the tray of little cups

There swam into my line of vision another such hand It laid itself on
my arm A voice sang in my ear softly

No Walter we have had enough Come let us go This is not like any
other known drugnot even the famous Cannabis indica hasheesh Let us
go as soon as we politely can I have found out what I wanted to know
Guerrero is not here

We rose shortly and excused ourselves and with general regrets in which
all but Torreon joined were bowed out with the same courtly politeness
with which we had been received

As we left the house the return to the world was quick It was like
coming out from the matinee and seeing the crowds on the street They
not the matinee were unreal for the moment But strange to say I
found one felt no depression as a result of the mescal intoxication

What is it about mescal that produces such results I asked

The alkaloids replied Kennedy as we walked slowly along Mescal was
first brought to the attention of scientists by explorers employed by
our bureau of ethnology Dr Weir Mitchell and Dr Harvey Wiley and
several German scientists have investigated it since then It is well
known that it contains half a dozen alkaloids and resins of curious
and littleinvestigated nature I cant recall even the names of them
offhand but I have them in my laboratory

As the effect of the mescal began to wear off in the fresh air I found
myself in a peculiar questioning state What had we gained by our visit
Looking calmly at it I could not help but ask myself why both Torreon
and Senora Mendez had acted as if they were concealing something about
the whereabouts of Guerrero Was she a spy Did she know anything about
the loss of the halfmillion dollars

Of one thing I was certain Torreon was an ardent admirer of the
beautiful senora equally ardent with Guerrero Was he simply a jealous
suitor angry at his rival and now glad that he was out of the way
Where had Guerrero gone The question was still unanswered

Absorbed in these reveries I did not notice particularly where Kennedy
was hurrying me In fact finding no plausible answer to my speculations
and knowing that it was useless to question Kennedy at this stage of his
inquiry I did not for the moment care where we went but allowed him to
take the lead

We entered one of the fine apartments on the drive and rode up in
the elevator A door opened and with a start I found myself in the
presence of Miss Guerrero again The questioning look on her face
recalled the object of our search and its ill success so far Why had
Kennedy come back with so little to report

Have you heard anything she asked eagerly

Not directly replied Kennedy But I have a clue at least I believe
that Torreon knows where your father is and will let you know any moment
now It is to his interest to clear himself before this scandal about
the money becomes generally known Would you allow me to search through
your fathers desk

For some moments Kennedy rummaged through the drawers and pigeonholes
silently

Where does the junta keep its arms storednot in the meetingplace on
South Street does it asked Kennedy at length

Not exactly that would be a little too risky she replied I believe
they have a loft above the office hired in someone elses name and not
connected with the place downstairs at all My father and Senor Torreon
are the only ones who have the keys Why do you ask

I ask replied Craig because I was wondering whether there might not
be something that would take him down to South Street last night It is
the only place I can think of his going to at such a late hour unless
he has gone out of town If we do not hear from Torreon soon I think I
will try what I can find down there Ah what is this

Kennedy drew forth a little silver box and opened it Inside reposed a
dozen mescal buttons

We both looked quickly at Miss Guerrero but it was quite evident that
she was unacquainted with them

She was about to ask what Kennedy had found when the telephone rang and
the maid announced that Miss Guerrero was wanted by Senor Torreon

A smile of gratification flitted over Kennedys face as he leaned over
to me and whispered It is evident that Torreon is anxious to clear
himself Ill wager he has done some rapid hustling since we left him

Perhaps this is some word about my father at last murmured Miss
Guerrero as she nervously hurried to the telephone and answered Yes
this is Senorita Guerrero Senor Torreon You are at the office of
the junta Yes yes you have word from my fatheryou went down
there tonight expecting some guns to be deliveredand you found him
thereupstairs in the loftill did you sayunconscious

In an instant her face was drawn and pale and the receiver fell
clattering to the hardwood floor from her nerveless fingers

He is dead she gasped as she swayed backward and I caught her With
Kennedys help I carried her limp and unconscious across the room and
placed her in a deep armchair I stood at her side but for the moment
could only look on helplessly blankly at the now stony beauty of her
face

Some water Juanita quick I cried as soon as I had recovered from
the shock Have you any smellingsalts or anything of that sort
Perhaps you can find a little brandy Hurry

While we were making her comfortable the telephone continued to tinkle

This is Kennedy I heard Craig say as Juanita came hurrying in with
water smellingsalts and brandy You fool She fainted Why couldnt
you break it to her gently Whats that address on South Street You
found him over the junta meetingplace in a loft Yes I understand
What were you doing down there You went down expecting a shipment
of arms and saw a light overhead I seeand suspecting something you
entered with a policeman You heard him move across the floor above
and fall heavily All right Someone will be down directly Ambulance
surgeon has tried everything you say No heart action no breathing
Sure Very well Let the body remain just where it is until I get
down Oh wait How long ago did it happen Fifteen minutes All right
Goodbye

Such restoratives as we had found we applied faithfully At last we were
rewarded by the first flutter of an eyelid Then Miss Guerrero gazed
wildly about

He is dead she moaned They have killed him I know it My father
is dead Over and over she repeated He is dead I shall never see him
again

Vainly I tried to soothe her What was there to say There could be
no doubt about it Torreon must have gone down directly after we left
Senora Mendez He had seen a light in the loft had entered with a
policemanas a witness he had told Craig over the telephonehad heard
Guerrero fall and had sent for the ambulance How long Guerrero had
been there he did not know for while members of the junta had been
coming and going all day in the office below none had gone up into the
locked loft

Kennedy with rare skill calmed Miss Guerreros dryeyed hysteria into
a gentle rain of tears which relieved her overwrought feelings We
silently withdrew leaving the two women mistress and servant weeping

Craig I asked when we had gained the street what do you make of it
We must lose no time Arrest this Mendez woman before she has a chance
to escape

Not so fast Walter he cautioned as we spun along in a taxicab Our
case isnt very complete against anybody yet

But it looks black for Guerrero I admitted Dead men tell no tales
even to clear themselves

It all depends on speed now he answered laconically

We had reached the university which was only a few blocks away and
Craig dashed into his laboratory while I settled with the driver He
reappeared almost instantly with some bulky apparatus under his arm
and we more than ran from the building to the nearby subway station
Fortunately there was an express just pulling in as we tumbled down the
steps

To one who knows South Street as merely a riverfront street whose glory
of other days has long since departed where an antiquated horsecar
now ambles slowly uptown and trucks and carts all day long are in a
perpetual jam it is peculiarly uninteresting by day and peculiarly
deserted and vicious by night But there is another fascination about
South Street Perhaps there has never been a revolution in Latin America
which has not in some way or other been connected with this street
whence hundreds of filibustering expeditions have started Whenever a
dictator is to be overthrown or half a dozen chocolateskinned generals
in the Caribbean become dissatisfied with their portions of gold lace
the arms and ammunitiondealers of South Street can give if they
choose an advance scenario of the whole tragedy or comic opera as the
case may be Real war or operabouffe it is all grist for the mills of
these closemouthed individuals

Our quest took us to a ramshackle building reminiscent of the days when
the street bristled with bowsprits of ships from all over the world an
age when the American merchantman flew our flag on the uttermost of the
sevenseas On the ground floor was an apparently innocent junk dealers
shop in reality the meetingplace of the junta By an outside stairway
the lofts above were reached hiding their secrets behind windows opaque
with decades of dust

At the door we were met by Torreon and the policeman Both appeared to
be shocked beyond measure Torreon was profuse in explanations which
did not explain Out of the tangled mass of verbiage I did manage to
extract however the impression that come what might to the other
members of the junta Torreon was determined to clear his own name at
any cost He and the policeman had discovered Senor Guerrero only a
short time before upstairs For all he knew Guerrero had been there
some time perhaps all day while the others were meeting downstairs
Except for the light he might have been there undiscovered still
Torreon swore he had heard Guerrero fall the policeman was not quite so
positive

Kennedy listened impatiently then sprang up the stairs only to call
back to the policeman Go call me a taxicab at the ferry an electric
cab Mind now not a gasolinecabelectric

We found the victim lying on a sort of bed of sailcloth in a loft
apparently devoted to the peaceful purposes of the junk trade but
really a perfect arsenal and magazine It was dusty and cobwebbed
crammed with stands of arms tents uniforms in bales batteries of
Maxims and mountainguns and all the paraphernalia for carrying on a
real twentiethcentury revolution

The young ambulance surgeon was still there so quickly had we been able
to get downtown He had his stomachpump hypodermic syringe emetics
and various tubes spread out on a piece of linen on a packingcase
Kennedy at once inquired just what he had done

Thought at first it was only a bad case of syncope he replied but
I guess he was dead some minutes before I got here Tried rhythmic
traction of the tongue artificial respiration stimulants chest and
heart massageeverything but it was no use

Have you any idea what caused his death asked Craig as he hastily
adjusted his apparatus to an electric light socketa rheostat an
inductioncoil of peculiar shape and an interrupter

Poison of some kindan alkaloid They say they heard him fall as they
came upstairs and when they got to him he was blue His face was as
blue as it is now when I arrived Asphyxia failure of both heart and
lungs that was what the alkaloid caused

The gong of the electric cab sounded outside As Craig heard it he
rushed with two wires to the window threw them out and hurried
downstairs attaching them to the batteries of the cab

In an instant he was back again

Now Doctor he said Im going to perform a very delicate test on
this man Here I have the alternating city current and here a direct
continuous current from the storagebatteries of the cab below Doctor
hold his mouth open So Now have you a pair of forceps handy Good
Can you catch hold of the tip of his tongue There Do just as I tell
you I apply this cathode to his skin in the dorsal region under the
back of the neck and this anode in the lumbar region at the base of the
spinejust pieces of cotton soaked in salt solution and covering the
metal electrodes to give me a good contact with the body

I was fascinated It was gruesome and yet I could not take my eyes
off it Torreon stood blankly in a daze Craig was as calm as if his
everyday work was experimenting on cadavers

He applied the current moving the anode and the cathode slowly I had
often seen the experiments on the nerves of a frog that had been freshly
killed how the electric current will make the muscles twitch as
discovered long ago by Galvani But I was not prepared to see it on a
human being Torreon muttered something and crossed himself

The arms seemed half to risethen suddenly to fall flabby again There
was a light hiss like an inspiration and expiration of air a ghastly
sound

Lungs react muttered Kennedy but the heart doesnt I must increase
the voltage

Again he applied the electrodes

The face seemed a different shade of blue I thought

Good God Kennedy I exclaimed do you suppose the effect of that
mescal on me hasnt worn off yet Blue blue everything blue is playing
pranks before my eyes Tell me is the blue of that facehis faceis
it changing Do you see it or do I imagine it

Blood asphyxiated was the disjointed reply The oxygen is clearing
it

But Kennedy I persisted his face was dark blue black a minute
ago The most astonishing change has taken place Its colour is almost
natural now Do I imagine it or is it real

Kennedy was so absorbed in his work that he made no reply at all He
heard nothing nothing save the slow forced inspiration and expiration
of air as he deftly and quickly manipulated the electrodes

Doctor he cried at length tell me what is going on in that heart

The young surgeon bent his head and placed his ear on the cold breast
As he raised his eyes and they chanced to rest on Kennedys hands
holding the electrodes dangling idly in the air I think I never saw a
greater look of astonishment on a human face Itisalmostnatural
he gasped

With great care and a milk diet for a few days Guerrero will live
said Kennedy quietly It is natural

My God man but he was dead exclaimed the surgeon I know it His
heart was stopped and his lungs collapsed

To all intents and purposes he was dead dead as ever a man was
replied Craig and would be now if I hadnt happened to think of this
special inductioncoil loaned to me by a doctor who had studied deeply
the process of electric resuscitation developed by Professor Leduc of
the Nantes Ecole de Medicin There is only one case I know of on record
which compares with thisa case of a girl resuscitated in Paris The
girl was a chronic morphineeater and was dead forty minutes

I stood like one frozen the thing was so incomprehensible after the
many surprises of the evening that had preceded Torreon in fact did
not comprehend for the moment

As Kennedy and I bent over Guerreros eyes opened but he apparently
saw nothing His hand moved a little and his lips parted Kennedy
quickly reached into the pockets of the man gasping for breath
one after another From a vest pocket he drew a little silver case
identical with that he had found in the desk uptown He opened it and
one mescal button rolled out into the palm of his hand Kennedy regarded
it thoughtfully

I suspect there is at least one devotee of the visionbreeding drug
who will no longer cultivate its use as a result of this he added
looking significantly at the man before us

Guerrero shouted Kennedy placing his mouth close to the mans ear
but muting his voice so that only I could distinguish what he said
Guerrero where is the money

His lips moved trembling again but I could not make out that he said
anything

Kennedy rose and quietly went over to detach his apparatus from the
electric light socket behind Torreon

Carramba I heard as I turned suddenly

Craig had Torreon firmly pinioned from behind by both arms The
policeman quickly interposed

Its all rightofficer exclaimed Craig Walter reach into his
inside pocket

I pulled out a bunch of papers and turned them over

Whats that asked Kennedy as I came to something neatly enclosed in
an envelope

I opened it It was a power of attorney from Guerrero to Torreon

Perhaps it is no crime to give a man mescal if he wants itI doubt if
the penal code covers that ejaculated Kennedy But it is conspiracy
to give it to him and extract a power of attorney by which you can get
control of trust funds consigned to him Manuel Torreon the game is up
You and Senora Mendez have played your parts well But you have
lost You waited until you thought Guerrero was dead then you took a
policeman along as a witness to clear yourself But the secret is not
dead after all Is there nothing else in those papers Walter Yes Ah
a bill of lading dated today Ten cases of scrap iron from New York
to Bostona long chance for such valuable scrap senor but I suppose
you had to get the money away from New York at any risk

And Senora Mendez I asked as my mind involuntarily reverted to the
brilliantly lighted room uptown What part did she have in the plot
against Guerrero

Torreon stood sullenly silent Kennedy reached in another of Torreons
pockets and drew out a third little silver box of mescal buttons
Holding all three of the boxes identically the same before us he
remarked Evidently Torreon was not averse to having his victim under
the influence of mescal as much as possible He must have forced it on
himalls fair in love and revolution I suppose I believe he brought
him down here under the influence of mescal last night obtained the
power of attorney and left him here to die of the mescal intoxication
It was just a case of too strong a hold of the mescalthe artificial
paradise was too alluring to Guerrero and Torreon knew it and tried to
profit by it to the extent of half a million dollars

It was more than I could grasp at the instant The impossible had
happened I had seen the deadliterallybrought back to life and the
secret which the criminal believed buried wrung from the grave

Kennedy must have noted the puzzled look on my face Walter he said
casually as he wrapped up his instruments dont stand there gaping
like Billikin Our part in this case is finishedat least mine is
But I suspect from some of the glances I have seen you steal at various
times thatwell perhaps you would like a few moments in a real
paradise I saw a telephone downstairs Go call up Miss Guerrero and
tell her her father is aliveand innocent




XII The Steel Door

It was what in college we used to call good football weathera
crisp autumn afternoon that sent the blood tingling through brain and
muscle Kennedy and I were enjoying a stroll on the drive dividing
our attention between the glowing red sunset across the Hudson and the
string of homewardbound automobiles on the broad parkway Suddenly a
huge black touring car marked with big letters PDNY shot past

Joyriding again in one of the citys cars I remarked I thought the
last Police Department shakeup had put a stop to that

Perhaps it has returned Kennedy Did you see who was in the car

No but I see it has turned and is coming back

It was InspectorI mean First Deputy OConnor I thought he
recognised us as he whizzed along and I guess he did too Ah
congratulations OConnor I havent had a chance to tell you before how
pleased I was to learn you had been appointed first deputy It ought to
have been commissioner though added Kennedy

Congratulations nothing rejoined OConnor Just another
newdealelection coming on mayor must make a show of getting some
reform done and all that sort of thing So he began with the Police
Department and here I am first deputy But say Kennedy he added
dropping his voice Ive a little job on my mind that Id like to pull
off in about as spectacular a fashion as Ias you know how I want to
make good conspicuously good at the startunderstand Maybe Ill be
broke for it and sent to pounding the pavements of Dismissalville
but I dont care Ill take a chance On the level Kennedy its a big
thing and it ought to be done Will you help me put it across

What is it asked Kennedy with a twinkle in his eye at OConnors
estimate of the security of his tenure of office

OConnor drew us away from the automobile toward the stone parapet
overlooking the railroad and river far below and out of earshot of
the department chauffeur I want to pull off a successful raid on the
Vesper Club he whispered earnestly scanning our faces

Good heavens man I ejaculated dont you know that Senator Danfield
is interested in

Jameson interrupted OConnor reproachfully I said on the level a
few moments ago and I meant it Senator Danfield hewell anyhow if I
dont do it the district attorney will with the aid of the Dowling law
and I am going to beat him to it thats all Theres too much money
being lost at the Vesper Club anyhow It wont hurt Danfield to be
taught a lesson not to run such a phony game I may like to put up a
quiet bet myself on the ponies now and thenI wont say I dont but
this thing of Danfields has got beyond all reason Its the crookedest
gambling joint in the city at least judging by the stories they tell of
losses there And so beastly aristocratic too Read that

OConnor shoved a letter into Kennedys hand a dainty perfumed and
monogrammed little missive addressed in a feminine hand It was such a
letter as comes by the thousand to the police in the course of a year
though seldom from ladies of the smart set

Dear Sir I notice in the newspapers this morning that you have just
been appointed first deputy commissioner of police and that you have
been ordered to suppress gambling in New York For the love that you
must still bear toward your own mother listen to the story of a mother
worn with anxiety for her only son and if there is any justice or
righteousness in this great city close up a gambling hell that is
sending to ruin scores of our finest young men No doubt you know
or have heard of my familythe DeLongs are not unknown in New York
Perhaps you have also heard of the losses of my son Percival at the
Vesper Club They are fast becoming the common talk of our set I am not
rich Mr Commissioner in spite of our social position but I am human
as human as a mother in any station of life and oh if there is any
way close up that gilded society resort that is dissipating our
small fortune ruining an only son and slowly bringing to the grave
a grayhaired widow as worthy of protection as any mother of the poor
whose plea has closed up a little poolroom or low policy shop

Sincerely

Mrs Julia M DeLong

PSPlease keep this confidentialat least from my son Percival

J M DeL


Well said Kennedy as he handed back the letter OConnor if you do
it Ill take back all the hard things Ive ever said about the police
system Young DeLong was in one of my classes at the university until
he was expelled for that last mad prank of his Theres more to that boy
than most people think but hes the wildest scion of wealth I have ever
come in contact with How are you going to pull off your raidis it to
be down through the skylight or up from the cellar

Kennedy replied OConnor in the same reproachful tone with which he
had addressed me talk sense Im in earnest You know the Vesper Club
is barred and barricaded like the National City Bank It isnt one of
those common gambling joints which depend for protection on what we
call icebox doors Its proof against all the old methods Axes and
sledgehammers would make no impression there

Your predecessor had some success at opening doors with a hydraulic
jack I believe in some very difficult raids put in Kennedy

A hydraulic jack wouldnt do for the Vesper Club Im afraid
remarked OConnor wearily Why sir that place has been proved
bombproofbombproof sir You remember recently the socalled
gamblers war in which some rivals exploded a bomb on the steps It
did more damage to the house next door than to the club However I can
get past the outer door I think even if it is strong But insideyou
must have heard of itis the famous steel door three inches thick
made of armourplate Its no use to try it at all unless we can pass
that door with reasonable quickness All the evidence we shall get will
be of an innocent social clubroom downstairs The gambling is all on
the second floor beyond this door in a room without a window in it
Surely youve heard of that famous gamblingroom with its perfect
system of artificial ventilation and electric lighting that makes it
rival noonday at midnight And dont tell me Ive got to get on the
other side of the door by strategy either It is strategyproof The
system of lookouts is perfect No force is necessary but it must not
be destructive of life or propertyor by heaven Id drive up there
and riddle the place with a fourteeninch gun exclaimed OConnor

Hm mused Kennedy as he flicked the ashes off his cigar and
meditatively watched a passing freighttrain on the railroad below us
There goes a car loaded with tons and tons of scrap iron You want me
to scrap that threeinch steel door do you

Kennedy Ill buy that particular scrap from you at almost its weight
in gold The fact is I have a secret fund at my disposal such as former
commissioners have asked for in vain I can afford to pay you well
as well as any private client and I hear you have had some good fees
lately Only deliver the goods

No answered Kennedy rather piqued it isnt money that I am after
I merely wanted to be sure that you are in earnest I can get you past
that door as if it were made of green baize

It was OConnors turn to look incredulous but as Kennedy apparently
meant exactly what he said he simply asked And will you

I will do it tonight if you say so replied Kennedy quietly Are you
ready

For answer OConnor simply grasped Craigs hand as if to seal the
compact

All right then continued Kennedy Send a furniturevan one of
those closed vans that the storage warehouses use up to my laboratory
any time before seven oclock How many men will you need in the raid
Twelve Will a van hold that many comfortably Ill want to put some
apparatus in it but that wont take much room

Why yes I think so answered OConnor Ill get a wellpadded van
so that they wont be badly jolted by the ride downtown By George
Kennedy I see you know more of that side of police strategy than I gave
you credit for

Then have the men drop into my laboratory singly about the same time
You can arrange that so that it will not look suspicious so far uptown
It will be dark anyhow Perhaps OConnor you can make up as the
driver yourselfanyhow get one you can trust absolutely Then have
the van down near the corner of Broadway below the club driving slowly
along about the time the theatre crowd is out Leave the rest to me I
will give you or the driver orders when the time comes

As OConnor thanked Craig he remarked without a shade of insincerity
Kennedy talk about being commissioner you ought to be commissioner

Wait till I deliver the goods answered Craig simply I may fall down
and bring you nothing but a lawsuit for damages for unlawful entry or
unjust persecution or whatever they call it

Ill take a chance at that called back OConnor as he jumped into his
car and directed Headquarters quick

As the car disappeared Kennedy filled his lungs with air as if
reluctant to leave the drive Our constitutional he remarked is
abruptly at an end Walter

Then he laughed as he looked about him

What a place in which to plot a raid on Danfields Vesper Club Why
the nursemaids have hardly got the children all in for supper and bed
Its incongruous Well I must go over to the laboratory and get some
things ready to put in that van with the men Meet me about halfpast
seven Walter up in the room all togged up Well dine at the Cafe
Riviera tonight in style And by the way youre quite a man about
townyou must know someone who can introduce us into the Vesper Club

But Craig I demurred if there is any rough work as a result it
might queer me with them They might object to being used

Oh that will be all right I just want to look the place over and
lose a few chips in a good cause No it wont queer any of your Star
connections Well be on the outside when the time comes for anything to
happen In fact I shouldnt wonder if your story would make you all the
more solid with the sports I take all the responsibility you can have
the glory You know they like to hear the inside gossip of such things
after the event Try it Remember at seventhirty Well be a little
late at dinner but never mind it will be early enough for the club

Left to my own devices I determined to do a little detective work on my
own account and not only did I succeed in finding an acquaintance who
agreed to introduce us at the Vesper Club that night about nine oclock
but I also learned that Percival DeLong was certain to be there that
night too I was necessarily vague about Kennedy for fear my friend
might have heard of some of his exploits but fortunately he did not
prove inquisitive

I hurried back to our apartment and was in the process of transforming
myself into a fullfledged boulevardier when Kennedy arrived in
an extremely cheerful frame of mind So far his preparations had
progressed very favourably I guessed and I was quite elated when he
complimented me on what I had accomplished in the meantime

Pretty tough for the fellows who are condemned to ride around in that
van for four mortal hours though he said as he hurried into his
evening clothes but they wont be riding all the time The driver will
make frequent stops

I was so busy that I paid little attention to him until he had nearly
completed his toilet I gave a gasp

Why whatever are you doing I exclaimed as I glanced into his room

There stood Kennedy arrayed in all the glory of a sharppointed
moustache and a goatee He had put on evening clothes of decidedly
Parisian cut clothes which he had used abroad and had brought back with
him but which I had never known him to wear since he came back On
a chair reposed a chimneypot hat that would have been pronounced
faultless on the continong but was unknown except among impresarios
on Broadway

Kennedy shrugged his shouldershe even had the shrug

Figure to yourself monsieur he said Ze great Kennedy ze detectif
Americainto put it tersely in our own vernacular wouldnt it be a
fool thing for me to appear at the Vesper Club where I should surely be
recognised by someone if I went in my ordinary clothes and features Un
faux pas at the start Jamais

There was nothing to do but agree and I was glad that I had been
discreetly reticent about my companion in talking with the friend who
was to gain us entrance to the Avernus beyond the steel door

We met my friend at the Riviera and dined sumptuously Fortunately he
seemed decidedly impressed with my friend Monsieur KayI could do no
better on the spur of the moment than take Kennedys initial which
seemed to serve We progressed amicably from oysters and soup down to
coffee cigars and liqueurs and I succeeded in swallowing Kennedys
tales of Monte Carlo and Ostend and Ascot without even a smile He
must have heard them somewhere and treasured them up for just such an
occasion but he told them in a manner that was verisimilitude itself
using perfect English with just the trace of an accent at the right
places

At last it was time to saunter around to the Vesper Club without seeming
to be too indecently early The theatres were not yet out but my friend
said play was just beginning at the club and would soon be in full
swing

I had a keen sense of wickedness as we mounted the steps in the yellow
flare of the flaming arclight on the Broadway corner not far below us
A heavy grated door swung open at the practised signal of my friend
and an obsequious negro servant stood bowing and pronouncing his name
in the sombre mahogany portal beyond with its green marble pillars and
handsome decorations A short parley followed after which we entered
my friend having apparently satisfied someone that we were all right

We did not stop to examine the first floor which doubtless was innocent
enough but turned quickly up a flight of steps At the foot of the
broad staircase Kennedy paused to examine some rich carvings and I felt
him nudge me I turned It was an enclosed staircase with walls that
looked to be of reenforced concrete Swung back on hinges concealed
like those of a modern burglarproof safe was the famous steel door

We did not wish to appear to be too interested yet a certain amount of
curiosity was only proper

My friend paused on the steps turned and came back

Youre perfectly safe he smiled tapping the door with his cane with
a sort of affectionate respect It would take the police ages to get
past that barrier which would be swung shut and bolted the moment the
lookout gave the alarm But there has never been any trouble The police
know that it is so far no farther Besides he added with a wink to
me you know Senator Danfield wouldnt like this pretty little door
even scratched Come up I think I hear DeLongs voice upstairs Youve
heard of him monsieur Its said his luck has changed Im anxious to
find out

Quickly he led the way up the handsome staircase and into a large
lofty richly furnished room Everywhere there were thick heavy carpets
on the floors into which your feet sank with an air of satisfying
luxury

The room into which we entered was indeed absolutely windowless It was
a room built within the original room of the old house Thus the windows
overlooking the street from the second floor in reality bore no relation
to it For light it depended on a complete oval of lights overhead
so arranged as to be themselves invisible but shining through richly
stained glass and conveying the illusion of a slightly clouded noonday
The absence of windows was made up for as I learned later by a
ventilating device so perfect that although everyone was smoking a
most fastidious person could scarcely have been offended by the odour of
tobacco

Of course I did not notice all this at first What I did notice
however was a farolayout and a hazardboard but as no one was playing
at either my eye quickly travelled to a roulettetable which stretched
along the middle of the room Some ten or a dozen men in evening clothes
were gathered watching with intent faces the spinning wheel There
was no money on the table nothing but piles of chips of various
denominations Another thing that surprised me as I looked was that the
tense look on the faces of the players was anything but the feverish
haggard gaze I had expected In fact they were sleek wellfed typical
prosperous NewYorkers rather inclined to the noticeable in dress and
carrying their avoirdupois as if life was an easy game with them Most
of them evidently belonged to the financial and society classes There
were no tragedies the tragedies were elsewherein their offices
homes in the courts anywhere but not here at the club Here all was
life light and laughter

For the benefit of those not acquainted with the roulettewheeland I
may as well confess that most of my own knowledge was gained in that one
crowded eveningI may say that it consists briefly of a wooden disc
very nicely balanced and turning in the centre of a cavity set into
a table like a circular washbasin with an outer rim turned slightly
inward The croupier revolves the wheel to the right With a quick
motion of his middle finger he flicks a marble usually of ivory to the
left At the Vesper Club always uptodate the ball was of platinum
not of ivory The disc with its sloping sides is provided with a number
of brass rods some perpendicular some horizontal As the ball and the
wheel lose momentum the ball strikes against the rods and finally is
deflected into one of the many little pockets or stalls facing the rim
of the wheel

There are thirtyeight of these pockets two are marked 0 and 00
the others numbered from one to thirtysix in an irregular and confusing
order and painted alternately red and black At each end of the table
are thirtysix large squares correspondingly numbered and coloured The
0 and 00 are of a neutral colour Whenever the ball falls in the 0
or 00 the bank takes the stakes or sweeps the the board The Monte
Carlo wheel has only one 0 while the typical American has two and
the Chinese has four

To one like myself who had read of the Continental gamblinghouses with
the clink of gold pieces on the table and the croupier with his wooden
rake noisily raking in the winnings of the bank the comparative silence
of the American game comes as a surprise

As we advanced we heard only the rattle of the ball the click of the
chips and the monotonous tone of the spinner Twentythree black
Eight red Seventeen black It was almost like the boys in a brokers
office calling off the quotations of the ticker and marking them up on
the board

Leaning forward almost oblivious to the rest was Percival DeLong a
tall lithe handsome young man whose boyish face ill comported with
the marks of dissipation clearly outlined on it Such a boy it flashed
across my mind ought to be studying the possible plays of football of
an evening in the fieldhouse after his dinner at the trainingtable
rather than the possible gyrations of the little platinum ball on the
wheel

Curse the luck he exclaimed as 17 appeared again

A Hebrew banker staked a pile of chips on the 17 to come up a third
time A murmur of applause at his nerve ran through the circle DeLong
hesitated as one who thought Seventeen has come out twicethe odds
against its coming again are too great even though the winnings would
be fabulous for a good stake He placed his next bet on another
number

Hes playing Lord Rosslyns system tonight whispered my friend

The wheel spun the ball rolled and the croupier called again
Seventeen black A tremor of excitement ran through the crowd It was
almost unprecedented

DeLong with a stifled oath leaned back and scanned the faces about the
table

And 17 has precisely the same chance of turning up in the next spin
as if it had not already had a run of three said a voice at my elbow

It was Kennedy The roulettetable needs no introduction when curious
sequences are afoot All are friends

Thats the theory of Sir Hiram Maxim commented my friend as he
excused himself reluctantly for another appointment But no true
gambler will believe it monsieur or at least act on it

All eyes were turned on Kennedy who made a gesture of polite
deprecation as if the remark of my friend were true but he
nonchalantly placed his chips on the 17

The odds against 17 appearing four consecutive times are some
millions he went on and yet having appeared three times it is just
as likely to appear again as before It is the usual practice to avoid a
number that has had a run on the theory that some other number is more
likely to come up than it is That would be the case if it were drawing
balls from a bag full of red and black ballsthe more red ones drawn
the smaller the chance of drawing another red one But if the balls are
put back in the bag after being drawn the chances of drawing a red one
after three have been drawn are exactly the same as ever If we toss
a cent and heads appear twelve times that does not have the slightest
effect on the thirteenth tossthere is still an even chance that it
too will be heads So if 17 had come up five times tonight it would
be just as likely to come the sixth as if the previous five had not
occurred and that despite the fact that before it has appeared at all
odds against a run of the same number six times in succession are about
two billion four hundred and ninetysix million and some thousands
Most systems are based on the old persistent belief that occurrences of
chance are affected in some way by occurrences immediately preceding
but disconnected physically If weve had a run of black for twenty
times system says play the red for the twentyfirst But black is just
as likely to turn up the twentyfirst as if it were the first play of
all The confusion arises because a run of twenty on the black should
happen once in one million fortyeight thousand five hundred and
seventysix coups It would take ten years to make that many coups and
the run of twenty might occur once or any number of times in it It is
only when one deals with infinitely large numbers of coups that one can
count on infinitely small variations in the mathematical results This
game does not go on for infinitytherefore anything everything may
happen Systems are based on the infinite we play in the finite

You talk like a professor I had at the university ejaculated DeLong
contemptuously as Craig finished his disquisition on the practical
fallibility of theoretically infallible systems Again DeLong carefully
avoided the 17 as well as the black

The wheel spun again the ball rolled The knot of spectators around the
table watched with bated breath

Seventeen won

As Kennedy piled up his winnings superciliously without even the
appearance of triumph a man behind me whispered A foreign nobleman
with a systemwatch him

Non monsieur said Kennedy quickly having overheard the remark no
system sir There is only one system of which I know

What asked DeLong eagerly

Kennedy staked a large sum on the red to win The black came up and
he lost He doubled the stake and played again and again lost With
amazing calmness Craig kept right on doubling

The martingale I heard the man whisper behind me In other words
double or quit

Kennedy was now in for some hundreds a sum that was sufficiently large
for him but he doubled again still cheerfully playing the red and the
red won As he gathered up his chips he rose

Thats the only system he said simply

But go on go on came the chorus from about the table

No said Kennedy quietly that is part of the system tooto quit
when you have won back your stakes and a little more

Huh exclaimed DeLong in disgust Suppose you were in for some
thousandsyou wouldnt quit If you had real sporting blood you
wouldnt quit anyhow

Kennedy calmly passed over the open insult letting it be understood
that he ignored this beardless youth

There is no way you can beat the game in the long run if you keep at
it he answered simply It is mathematically impossible Consider We
are Croesuseswe hire players to stake money for us on every possible
number at every coup How do we come out If there are no 0 or 00
we come out after each coup precisely where we startedwe are paying
our own money back and forth among ourselves we have neither more
nor less But with the 0 and 00 the bank sweeps the board every so
often It is only a question of time when after paying our money back
and forth among ourselves it has all filtered through the 0 and 00
into the bank It is not a game of chance for the bankah it is exact
mathematicalcest une question d arithmetique seulement nestce
pas messieurs

Perhaps admitted DeLong but it doesnt explain why I am losing
tonight while everyone else is winning

We are not winning persisted Craig After I have had a bite to eat I
will demonstrate how to loseby keeping on playing He led the way to
the cafe

DeLong was too intent on the game to leave even for refreshments Now
and then I saw him beckon to an attendant who brought him a stiff drink
of whiskey For a moment his play seemed a little better then he
would drop back into his hopeless losing For some reason or other his
system failed absolutely

You see he is hopeless mused Kennedy over our light repast And
yet of all gambling games roulette offers the player the best odds far
better than horseracing for instance Our method has usually been to
outlaw roulette and permit horse racing in other words suppress the
more favourable and permit the less favourable However were doing
better now were suppressing both Of course what I say applies only to
roulette when it is honestly playedDeLong would lose anyhow I fear

I started at Kennedys tone and whispered hastily What do you mean Do
you think the wheel is crooked

I havent a doubt of it he replied in an undertone That run of 17
might happenyes But it is improbable They let me win because I was
a new playernew players always win at first It is proverbial but
the man who is running this game has made it look like a platitude To
satisfy myself on that point I am going to play againuntil I have lost
my winnings and am just square with the game When I reach the point
that I am convinced that some crooked work is going on I am going to try
a little experiment Walter I want you to stand close to me so that no
one can see what I am doing Do just as I will indicate to you

The gamblingroom was now fast filling up with the first of the theatre
crowd DeLongs table was the centre of attraction owing to the high
play A group of young men of his set were commiserating with him on his
luck and discussing it with the finished air of roues of double their
ages He was doggedly following his system

Kennedy and I approached

Ah here is the philosophical stranger again DeLong exclaimed
catching sight of Kennedy Perhaps he can enlighten us on how to win at
roulette by playing his own system

Au contrarie monsieur let me demonstrate how to lose answered Craig
with a smile that showed a row of faultless teeth beneath his black
moustache decidedly foreign

Kennedy played and lost and lost again then he won but in the main he
lost After one particularly large loss I felt his arm on mine drawing
me closely to him DeLong had taken a sort of grim pleasure in the fact
that Kennedy too was losing I found that Craig had paused in his play
at a moment when DeLong had staked a large sum that a number below 18
would turn upfor five plays the numbers had been between 18 and
36 Curious to see what Craig was doing I looked cautiously down
between us All eyes were fixed on the wheel Kennedy was holding an
ordinary compass in the crookedup palm of his hand The needle pointed
at me as I happened to be standing north of it

The wheel spun Suddenly the needle swung around to a point between
the north and south poles quivered a moment and came to rest in that
position Then it swung back to the north

It was some seconds before I realised the significance of it It had
pointed at the tableand DeLong had lost again There was some electric
attachment at work

Kennedy and I exchanged glances and he shoved the compass into my hand
quickly You watch it Walter while I play he whispered

Carefully concealing it as he had done yet holding it as close to the
table as I dared I tried to follow two things at once without betraying
myself As near as I could make out something happened at every play I
would not go so far as to assert that whenever the larger stakes were on
a certain number the needle pointed to the opposite side of the wheel
for it was impossible to be at all accurate about it Once I noticed the
needle did not move at all and he won But at the next play he staked
what I knew must be the remainder of his winnings on what seemed a
very good chance Even before the wheel was revolved and the ball set
rolling the needle swung about and when the platinum ball came to rest
Kennedy rose from the table a loser

By George though exclaimed DeLong grasping his hand I take it all
back You are a good loser sir I wish I could take it as well as you
do But then Im in too deeply There are too many markers with the
house up against me

Senator Danfield had just come in to see how things were going He was
a sleek fat man and it was amazing to see with what deference his
victims treated him He affected not to have heard what DeLong said but
I could imagine what he was thinking for I had heard that he had scant
sympathy with anyone after he went brokeanother evidence of the
camaraderie and goodfellowship that surrounded the game

Kennedys next remark surprised me Oh your luck will change D
Leveryone referred to him as D L for gamblinghouses have an
aversion for real names and greatly prefer initialsyour luck will
change presently Keep right on with your system Its the best you can
do tonight short of quitting

Ill never quit replied the young man under his breath

Meanwhile Kennedy and I paused on the way out to compare notes My
report of the behaviour of the compass only confirmed him in his
opinion

As we turned to the stairs we took in a full view of the room A
farolayout was purchasing Senator Danfield a new touringcar every
hour at the expense of the players Another group was gathered about the
hazard board deriving evident excitement though I am sure none could
have given an intelligent account of the chances they were taking Two
roulettetables were now going full blast the larger crowd still about
DeLongs Snatches of conversation came to us now and then and I caught
one sentence De Longs in for over a hundred thousand now on the
weeks play I understand poor boythat about cleans him up

The tragedy of it Craig I whispered but he did not hear

With his hat tilted at a rakish angle and his operacoat over his arm he
sauntered over for a last look

Any luck yet he asked carelessly

The devilno returned the boy

Do you know what my advice to you is the advice of a man who has seen
high play everywhere from Monte Carlo to Shanghai

What

Play until your luck changes if it takes until tomorrow

A supercilious smile crossed Senator Danfields fat face

I intend to and the haggard young face turned again to the table and
forgot us

For Heavens sake Kennedy I gasped as we went down the stairway
what do you mean by giving him such adviceyou

Not so loud Walter Hed have done it anyhow I suppose but I want
him to keep at it This night means life or death to Percival DeLong and
his mother too Come on lets get out of this

We passed the formidable steel door and gained the street jostled by
the latecomers who had left the aftertheatre restaurants for a few
moments of play at the famous club that so long had defied the police

Almost gaily Kennedy swung along toward Broadway At the corner he
hesitated glanced up and down caught sight of the furniturevan in the
middle of the next block The driver was tugging at the harness of the
horses apparently fixing it We walked along and stopped beside it

Drive around in front of the Vesper Club slowly said Kennedy as the
driver at last looked up

The van lumbered ahead and we followed it casually Around the corner
it turned We turned also My heart was going like a sledgehammer as the
critical moment approached My head was in a whirl What would that gay
throng back of those darkened windows down the street think if they knew
what was being prepared for them

On like the Trojan horse the van lumbered A man went into the Vesper
Club and I saw the negro at the door eye the oncoming van suspiciously
The door banged shut

The next thing I knew Kennedy had ripped off his disguise had flung
himself up behind the van and had swung the doors open A dozen men
with ages and sledgehammers swarmed out and up the steps of the club

Call the reserves OConnor cried Kennedy Watch the roof and the
back yard

The driver of the van hastened to send in the call

The sharp raps of the hammers and the axes sounded on the thick
brassbound oak of the outside door in quick succession There was a
scurry of feet inside and we could hear a grating noise and a terrific
jar as the inner steel door shut

A raid A raid on the Vesper Club shouted a belated passerby
The crowd swarmed around from Broadway as if it were noon instead of
midnight

Banging and ripping and tearing the outer door was slowly forced As
it crashed in the quick gongs of several police patrols sounded The
reserves had been called out at the proper moment too late for them
to tip off the club that there was going to be a raid as frequently
occurs

Disregarding the melee behind me I leaped through the wreckage with the
other raiders The steel door barred all further progress with its
cold blue impassibility How were we to surmount this last and most
formidable barrier

I turned in time to see Kennedy and OConnor hurrying up the steps
with a huge tank studded with bolts like a boiler while two other men
carried a second tank

There ordered Craig set the oxygen there as he placed his own
tank on the opposite side

Out of the tanks stout tubes led with stopcocks and gages at the top
From a case under his arm Kennedy produced a curious arrangement like a
huge hook with a curved neck and a sharp beak Really it consisted of
two metal tubes which ran into a sort of cylinder or mixing chamber
above the nozzle while parallel to them ran a third separate tube with
a second nozzle of its own Quickly he joined the ends of the tubes from
the tanks to the metal hook the oxygentank being joined to two of the
tubes of the hook and the second tank being joined to the other With
a match he touched the nozzle gingerly Instantly a hissing spitting
noise followed and an intense blinding needle of flame

Now for the oxyacetylene blowpipe cried Kennedy as he advanced
toward the steel door Well make short work of this

Almost as he said it the steel beneath the blowpipe became
incandescent

Just to test it he cut off the head of a threequarterinch steel
rivettaking about a quarter of a minute to do it It was evident
though that that would not weaken the door appreciably even if the
rivets were all driven through Still they gave a startingpoint for the
flame of the highpressure acetylene torch

It was a brilliant sight The terrific heat from the first nozzle caused
the metal to glow under the torch as if in an openhearth furnace From
the second nozzle issued a stream of oxygen under which the hot metal
of the door was completely consumed The force of the blast as the
compressed oxygen and acetylene were expelled carried a fine spray of
the disintegrated metal visibly before it And yet it was not a big hole
that it madescarcely an eighth of an inch wide but clear and sharp
as if a buzzsaw were eating its way through a threeinch plank of white
pine

With tense muscles Kennedy held this terrific engine of destruction
and moved it as easily as if it had been a mere pencil of light He was
easily the calmest of us all as we crowded about him at a respectful
distance

Acetylene as you may know he hastily explained never pausing for a
moment in his work is composed of carbon and hydrogen As it burns at
the end of the nozzle it is broken into carbon and hydrogenthe carbon
gives the high temperature and the hydrogen forms a cone that protects
the end of the blowpipe from being itself burnt up

But isnt it dangerous I asked amazed at the skill with which he
handled the blowpipe

Not particularlywhen you know how to do it In that tank is a porous
asbestos packing saturated with acetone under pressure Thus I can
carry acetylene safely for it is dissolved and the possibility of
explosion is minimised This mixing chamber by which I am holding the
torch where the oxygen and acetylene mix is also designed in such
a way as to prevent a flashback The best thing about this style of
blowpipe is the ease with which it can be transported and the curious
useslike the presentto which it can be put

He paused a moment to test the door All was silence on the other side
The door itself was as firm as ever

Huh exclaimed one of the detectives behind me these newfangled
things aint all theyre cracked up to be Now if I was runnin this
show Id dynamite that door to kingdom come

And wreck the house and kill a few people I returned hotly resenting
the criticism of Kennedy Kennedy affected not to hear

When I shut off the oxygen in this second jet he resumed as if
nothing had been said you see the torch merely heats the steel I can
get a heat of approximately sixtythree hundred degrees Fahrenheit and
the flame will exert a pressure of fifty pounds to the square inch

Wonderful exclaimed OConnor who had not heard the remark of his
subordinate and was watching with undisguised admiration Kennedy how
did you ever think of such a thing

Why its used for welding you know answered Craig as he continued
to work calmly in the growing excitement I first saw it in actual
use in mending a cracked cylinder in an automobile The cylinder was
repaired without being taken out at all Ive seen it weld new teeth and
build up old worn teeth on gearing as good as new

He paused to let us see the terrifically heated metal under the flame

You remember when we were talking on the drive about the raid
OConnor A carload of scrapiron went by on the railroad below us
They use this blowpipe to cut it up frequently Thats what gave me the
idea See I turn on the oxygen now in this second nozzle The blowpipe
is no longer an instrument for joining metals together but for
cutting them asunder The steel burns just as you perhaps have seen
a watchspring burn in a jar of oxygen Steel hard or soft tempered
annealed chrome or Harveyised it all burns just as fast and just as
easily And its cheap too This raid may cost a couple of dollars as
far as the blowpipe is concernedquite a difference from the thousands
of dollars loss that would follow an attempt to blow the door in

The last remark was directed quietly at the doubting detective He had
nothing to say We stood in awestruck amazement as the torch slowly
inexorably traced a thin line along the edge of the door

Minute after minute sped by as the line burned by the blowpipe cut
straight from top to bottom It seemed hours to me Was Kennedy going to
slit the whole door and let it fall in with a crash

No I could see that even in his cursory examination of the door he had
gained a pretty good knowledge of the location of the bolts imbedded in
the steel One after another he was cutting clear through and severing
them as if with a superhuman knife

What was going on on the other side of the door I wondered I could
scarcely imagine the consternation of the gamblers caught in their own
trap

With a quick motion Kennedy turned off the acetylene and oxygen The
last bolt had been severed A gentle push of the hand and he swung the
once impregnable door on its delicately poised hinges as easily as if he
had merely said Open Sesame The robbers cave yawned before us

We made a rush up the stairs Kennedy was first OConnor next and
myself scarcely a step behind with the rest of OConnors men at our
heels

I think we were all prepared for some sort of gunplay for the crooks
were desperate characters and I myself was surprised to encounter
nothing but physical force which was quickly overcome

In the now disordered richness of the rooms waving his John Doe
warrants in one hand and his pistol in the other OConnor shouted
youre all under arrest gentlemen If you resist further it will go
hard with you

Crowded now in one end of the room in speechless amazement was the late
gay party of gamblers including Senator Danfield himself They had
reckoned on toying with any chance but this The pale white face of
DeLong among them was like a spectre as he stood staring blankly about
and still insanely twisting the roulette wheel before him

Kennedy advanced toward the table with an ax which he had seized from
one of our men A welldirected blow shattered the mechanism of the
delicate wheel

DeLong he said Im not going to talk to you like your old professor
at the university nor like your recent friend the Frenchman with a
system This is what you have been up against my boy Look

His forefinger indicated an ingenious but now tangled and twisted
series of minute wires and electromagnets in the broken wheel before
us Delicate brushes led the current into the wheel With another blow
of his axe Craig disclosed wires running down through the leg of the
table to the floor and under the carpet to buttons operated by the man
who ran the game

Whwhat does it mean asked DeLong blankly

It means that you had little enough chance to win at a straight game of
roulette But the wheel is very rarely straight even with all the
odds in favour of the bank as they are This game was electrically
controlled Others are mechanically controlled by what is sometimes
called the mules ear and other devices You cant win These wires
and magnets can be made to attract the little ball into any pocket
the operator desires Each one of those pockets contains a little
electromagnet One set of magnets in the red pockets is connected with
one button under the carpet and a battery The other set in the black
pockets is connected with another button and the battery This ball is
not really of platinum Platinum is nonmagnetic It is simply a soft
iron hollow ball plated with platinum Whichever set of electromagnets
is energised attracts the ball and by this simple method it is in the
power of the operator to let the ball go to red or black as he may
wish Other similar arrangements control the odd or even and other
combinations from other push buttons A special arrangement took care
of that 17 freak There isnt an honest gamblingmachine in the whole
placeI might almost say the whole city The whole thing is crooked
from start to finishthe men the machines the

That machine could be made to beat me by turning up a run of 17 any
number of times or red or black or odd or even over 18 or under
18 or anything

Anything DeLong

And I never had a chance he repeated meditatively fingering the
wires They broke me tonight DanfieldDeLong turned looking
dazedly about in the crowd for his former friend then his hand
shot into his pocket and a little ivoryhandled pistol flashed
outDanfield your blood is on your own head You have ruined me

Kennedy must have been expecting something of the sort for he seized
the arm of the young man weakened by dissipation and turned the pistol
upward as if it had been in the grasp of a mere child

A blinding flash followed in the farthest corner of the room and a huge
puff of smoke Before I could collect my wits another followed in the
opposite corner The room was filled with a dense smoke

Two men were scuffing at my feet One was Kennedy As I dropped down
quickly to help him I saw that the other was Danfield his face purple
with the violence of the struggle

Dont be alarmed gentlemen I heard OConnor shout the explosions
were only the flashlights of the official police photographers We now
have the evidence complete Gentlemen you will now go down quietly to
the patrolwagons below two by two If you have anything to say say it
to the magistrate of the night court

Hold his arms Walter panted Kennedy

I did With a dexterity that would have done credit to a pickpocket
Kennedy reached into Danfields pocket and pulled out some papers

Before the smoke had cleared and order had been restored Craig
exclaimed Let him up Walter Here DeLong here are the IOUs
against you Tear them upthey are not even a debt of honour
