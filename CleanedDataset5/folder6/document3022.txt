A CUMBERLAND VENDETTA

By John Fox Jr


TO MINERVA AND ELIZABETH




I

THE cave had been their hidingplace as children it was a secret refuge
now against hunger or darkness when they were hunting in the woods The
primitive meal was finished ashes were raked over the red coals the
slice of bacon and the little bag of meal were hung high against
the rock wall and the two stepped from the cavern into a thicket of
rhododendrons

Parting the bushes toward the dim light they stood on a massive
shoulder of the mountain the river girding it far below and the
afternoon shadows at their feet Both carried gunsthe tall mountaineer
a Winchester the boy a squirrel rifle longer than himself Climbing
about the rocky spur they kept the same level over log and bowlder and
through bushy ravine to the north In half an hour they ran into a path
that led up home from the river and they stopped to rest on a cliff
that sank in a solid black wall straight under them The sharp edge of a
steep cornfield ran near and stripped of blade and tassel the stalks
and hooded ears looked in the coming dusk a little like monks at prayer
In the sunlight across the river the corn stood thin and frail Over
there a drought was on it and when drifting thistleplumes marked the
noontide of the year each yellow stalk had withered blades and an empty
sheath Everywhere a look of vague trouble lay upon the face of the
mountains and when the wind blew the silver of the leaves showed
ashen Autumn was at hand

There was no physical sign of kinship between the two halfbrothers
though they were The tall one was dark the boy a foundling had
flaxen hair and was stunted and slender He was a dreamylooking little
fellow and one may easily find his like throughout the Cumberlandpaler
than his fellows from staying much indoors with halfhaunted face and
eyes that are deeply pathetic when not cunning ignorantly credited with
idiocy and uncanny powers treated with much forbearance some awe and
a little contempt and suffered to do his pleasurenothing or much that
is strangewithout comment

I tell ye Rome he said taking up the thread of talk that was broken
at the cave when Uncle Gabe says hes afeard thars trouble comm
hits acomm n I want you to git me a Winchester Im agittin big
enough now I kin shoot might nigh as good as you n whut am I fit
fer with this hyeh old pawpaw popgun

I dont want you fightin boy Ive told ye Yu air too little n
puny n I want ye to stay home n take keer o mam n the cattleef
fightin does come I reckon thar wont be triuch

Dont ye cried the boy with sharp contemptwith ole Jas Lewallen
adevilin Uncle Rufe n that blackheaded young Jas aclimbin on
stumps over thar cross the river n crowin n sayin out open in
Hazlan that ye air afeard o him Yes n he called me a idgit The
boys voice broke into a whimper of rage

Shet up Isom Dont you go gittin mad now Youll be sick agin Ill
tend to him when the time comes Rome spoke with rough kindness but
ugly lines had gathered at his mouth and forehead The boys tears came
and went easily He drew his sleeve across his eyes and looked up the
river Beyond the bend three huge birds rose into the sunlight and
floated toward them Close at hand they swerved sidewise

They haint buzzards he said standing up his anger gone look at
them straight wings

Again the eagles swerved and two shot across the river The third
dropped with shut wings to the bare crest of a gaunt old poplar under
them

Hits a young un Romey said the boy excitedly Hes goin to wait
thar tell the old uns come back Gimme that gun

Catching up the Winchester he slipped over the ledge and Rome leaned
suddenly forward looking down at the river

A group of horsemen had ridden around the bend and were coming at
a walk down the other shore Every man carried something across his
saddlebow There was a gray horse among themyoung Jaspersand an
evil shadow came into Romes face and quickly passed Near a strip of
woods the gray turned up the mountain from the party and on its back he
saw the red glint of a womans dress With a halfsmile he watched the
scarlet figure ride from the woods and climb slowly up through the
sunny corn On the spur above and full in the rich yellow light she
halted half turning in her saddle He rose to his feet to his full
height his head bare and thrown far back between his big shoulders
and still as statues the man and the woman looked at each other across
the gulf of darkening air A full minute the woman sat motionless then
rode on At the edge of the woods she stopped and turned again

The eagle under Rome leaped one stroke in the air and dropped like a
clod into the sea of leaves The report of the gun and a faint cry of
triumph rose from below It was good marksmanship but on the cliff Rome
did not heed it Something had fluttered in the air above the girls
head and he laughed aloud She was waving her bonnet at him

JUST where young Stetson stood the mountains racing along each bank of
the Cumberland had sent out against each other by mutual impulse
two great spurs At the rivers brink they stopped sheer with crests
uplifted as though some hand at the last moment had hurled them apart
and had led the water through the breach to keep them at peace Today
the crags looked seamed by thwarted passion and sullen with firs they
made fit symbols of the human hate about the base of each

When the feud began no one knew Even the original cause was forgotten
Both families had come as friends from Virginia long ago and had lived
as enemies nearly half a century There was hostility before the
war but until then little bloodshed Through the hatred of change
characteristic of the mountaineer the world over the Lewallens were for
the Union The Stetsons owned a few slaves and they fought for them
Peace found both still neighbors and worse foes The war armed them
and brought back an ancestral contempt for human life it left them a
heritage of lawlessness that for mutual protection made necessary the
very means used by their feudal forefathers personal hatred supplanted
its dead issues and with them the war went on The Stetsons had a good
strain of AngloSaxon blood and owned valleylands the Lewallens
kept store and made moonshine so kindred and debtors and kindred and
tenants were arrayed with one or the other leader and gradually the
retainers of both settled on one or the other side of the river In time
of hostility the Cumberland came to be the boundary between life and
death for the dwellers on each shore It was feudalism born again

Above one of the spurs each family had its home the Stetsons under
the seared face of Thunderstruck Knob the Lewallens just beneath the
wooded rim of Wolfs Head The eaves and chimney of each cabin were
faintly visible from the porch of the other The first light touched the
house of the Stetsons the last the Lewallen cabin So there were times
when the one could not turn to the sunrise nor the other to the sunset
but with a curse in his heart for his eye must fall on the home of his
enemy

For years there had been peace The death of Rome Stetsons father from
ambush and the fight in the courthouse square had forced it After
that fight only four were leftold Jasper Lewallen and young Jasper the
boy Rome and his uncle Rufe Stetson Then Rufe fled to the West and
the Stetsons were helpless For three years no word was heard of him
but the hatred burned in the heart of Romes mother and was traced deep
in her grim old face while she patiently waited the day of retribution
It smouldered too in the hearts of the women of both clans who had
lost husbands or sons or lovers and the friends and kin of each had
little to do with one another and met and passed with watchful eyes
Indeed it would take so little to turn peace to war that the wonder was
that peace had lived so long Now trouble was at hand Rufe Stetson had
come back at last a few months since and had quietly opened store at
the countyseat Hazlana little town five miles up the river where
Troubled Fork runs seething into the Cumberlanda point of neutrality
for the factions and consequently a battleground Old Jaspers store
was at the other end of the town and the old man had never been known
to brook competition He had driven three men from Hazlan during the
last term of peace for this offence and everybody knew that the fourth
must leave or fight Already Rufe Stetson had been warned not to appear
outside his door after dusk Once or twice his wife had seen skulking
shadows under the trees across the road and a tremor of anticipation
ran along both banks of the Cumberland




III

A FORTNIGHT later court came Rome was going to Hazlan and the feeble
old Stetson mother limped across the porch from the kitchen trailing a
Winchester behind her Usually he went unarmed but he took the gun now
as she gave it in silence

The boy Isom was not well and Rome had told him to ride the horse But
the lad had gone on afoot to his duties at old Gabe Bunchs mill and
Rome himself rode down Thunderstruck Knob through the mist and dew of
the early morning The sun was coming up over Virginia and through a
dip in Black Mountain the foothills beyond washed in blue waves against
its white disk A little way down the mountain the rays shot through
the gap upon him and lancing the mist into tatters and lighting the
dewdrops set the birds singing Rome rode heedless of it all
under primeval oak and poplar and along rainclear brooks and happy
waterfalls shut in by laurel and rhododendron and singing past mossy
stones and lacelike ferns that brushed his stirrup On the brow of every
cliff he would stop to look over the trees and the river to the other
shore where the gray line of a path ran aslant Wolfs Head and was
lost in woods above and below

At the river he rode upstream looking still across it Old Gabe Bunch
halloed to him from the doorway of the mill as he splashed through the
creek and Isoms thin face peered through a breach in the logs At the
ford beyond he checked his horse with a short oath of pleased surprise
Across the water a scarlet dress was moving slowly past a brown field
of corn The figure was bonneted but he knew the girls walk and the
poise of her head that far away Just who she was however he did
not know and he sat irresolute He had seen her first a month since
paddling along the other shore erect and with bonnet off and hair
down she had taken the Lewallen path up the mountain Afterward he saw
her going at a gallop on young Jaspers gray horse bareheaded again
and with her hair loose to the wind and he knew she was one of his
enemies He thought her the girl people said young Jasper was going
to marry and he had watched her the more closely From the canoe she
seemed never to notice him but he guessed from the quickened sweep
of her paddle that she knew he was looking at her and once when he
halted on his way home up the mountain she half turned in her saddle
and looked across at him This happened again and then she waved her
bonnet at him It was bad enough any Stetson seeking any Lewallen for a
wife and for him to court young Jaspers sweetheartit was a thought to
laugh at But the mischief was done The gesture thrilled him whether
it meant defiance or goodwill and the mere deviltry of such a
courtship made him long for it at every sight of her with the river
between them At once he began to plan how he should get near her but
through some freak she had paid no further heed to him He saw her less
oftenfor a week indeed he had not seen her at all till this dayand
the forces that hindrance generates in an imperious nature had been at
work within him The chance now was one of gold and with his life in
his hand he turned into the stream Across he could see something white
on her shoulderan empty bag It was grindingday and she was going to
the millthe Lewallen mill She stopped as he galloped up and turned
pushing back her bonnet with one hand and he drew rein But the
friendly expectant light in her face kindled to such a blaze of anger
in her eyes that he struck his horse violently as though the beast
had stopped of its own accord and cursing himself kept on A little
farther he halted again Three horsemen armed with Winchesters were
jogging along toward town ahead of him and he wheeled about sharply
The girl climbing rapidly toward Steve Braytons cabin was out of the
way but he was too late to reach the ford again Down the road two
more Lewallens with guns were in sight and he lashed his horse into the
stream where the water was deep Old Gabe looking from the door of his
mill quit laughing to himself and under cover of the woods the girl
watched man and horse fighting the tide Twice young Stetson turned his
head But his enemies apparently had not seen him and horse and rider
scrambled up the steep bank and under shelter of the trees The girl had
evidently learned who he was Her sudden anger was significant as
was the sight of the Lewallens going armed to court and Rome rode on
uneasy

When he reached Troubled Fork in sight of Hazlan he threw a cartridge
into place and shifted the slide to see that it was ready for use
Passing old Jaspers store on the edge of the town he saw the old mans
bushy head through the open door and Lewallens and Braytons crowded out
on the steps and looked after him All were armed Twenty paces farther
he met young Jasper on his gray and the look on his enemys face made
him grip his rifle With a flashing crossfire from eye to eye the two
passed each with his thumb on the hammer of his Winchester The groups
on the courthouse steps stopped talking as he rode by and turned to
look at him He saw none of his own friends and he went on at a gallop
to Rufe Stetsons store His uncle was not in sight Steve Marcum and
old Sam Day stood in the porch and inside a woman was crying Several
Stetsons were near and all with grave faces gathered about him

He knew what the matter was before Steve spoke His uncle had been
driven from town A last warning had come to him on the day before The
hand of a friend was in the caution and Rufe rode away at dusk That
night his house was searched by men masked and armed The Lewallens were
in town and were ready to fight The crisis had come




IV


BACK at the mill old Gabe was troubled Usually he sat in a
canebottomed chair near the hopper whittling while the lad tended the
mill and took pay in an oaken tolldish smooth with the use of half a
century But the incident across the river that morning had made the old
man uneasy and he moved restlessly from his chair to the door and back
again while the boy watched him wondering what the matter was but
asking no questions At noon an old mountaineer rode by and the miller
hailed him

Any news in town he asked

Haint been to town Reckon fightin s goin on thar from whut I
heerd The careless highpitched answer brought the boy with wide eyes
to the door

Whut dye hear asked Gabe Jes heerd fightin s goin on

Then every man who came for his meal brought a wild rumor from town
and the old miller moved his chair to the door and sat there whittling
fast and looking anxiously toward Hazlan The boy was in a fever of
unrest and old Gabe could hardly keep him in the mill In the middle of
the afternoon the report of a rifle came down the river breaking into
echoes against the cliffs below and Isom ran out the door and stood
listening for another with an odd contradiction of fear and delight on
his eager face In a few moments Rome Stetson galloped into sight and
with a shrill cry of relief the boy ran down the road to meet him
and ran back holding by a stirrup Young Stetsons face was black with
passion and his eyes were heavy with drink At the door of the mill
he swung from his horse and for a moment was hardly able to speak from
rage There had been no fight The Stetsons were few and unprepared
They had neither the guns nor without Rufe the means to open the war
and they believed Rufe had gone for arms So they had chafed in the
store all day and all day Lewallens on horseback and on foot were in
sight and each was a taunt to every Stetson and few as they were
the young and hotheaded wanted to go out and fight In the afternoon
a talebearer had brought some of Jaspers boasts to Rome and made
reckless by moonshine and much brooding he sprang up to lead them
Steve Marcum too caught up his gun but old Sams counsel checked him
and the two by force held Rome back A little later the Lewallens left
town The Stetsons too disbanded and on the way home a last drop of
gall ran Romes cup of bitterness over Opposite Steve Braytons cabin
a jet of smoke puffed from the bushes across the river and a bullet
furrowed the road in front of him That was the shot they had heard at
the mill Somebody was drawing a deadline and Rome wheeled his horse
at the brink of it A mocking yell came over the river and a gray horse
flashed past an open space in the bushes Rome knew the horse and
knew the yell young Jasper was bantering him Nothing maddens the
mountaineer like this childish method of insult and telling of it Rome
sat in a corner and loosed a torrent of curses against young Lewallen
and his clan

Old Gabe had listened without a word and the strain in his face was
eased Always the old man had stood for peace He believed it had come
after the courthouse fight and he had hoped against hope even
when Rufe came back to trade against old Jasper for Rufe was big and
goodnatured and unsuspected of resolute purpose and the Lewallens
power had weakened So now that Rufe was gone again the old miller
half believed he was gone for good Nobody was hurt there was a chance
yet for peace and with a rebuke on his tongue and relief in his face
the old man sat back in his chair and went on whittling The boy
turned eagerly to a crevice in the logs and trembling with excitement
searched the other bank for Jaspers gray horse going home

He called me a idgit he said to himself with a threatening shake of
his head Jes wouldnt I like to hev a chance at him Rome ull git him
Rome ull git him

There was no moving point of white on the broad face of the mountains
nor along the river road Jasper was yet to come and with ears alert
to every word behind him the lad fixed his eyes where he should see him
first

Oh he didnt mean to hit me Not that he aint mean enough to shoot
from the bresh Rome broke out savagely Thats jes whut Im afeard
he will do Thar was too much daylight fer him Ef he jes dont come
asneakin over hyeh n waitin in the lorrel atter dark fer me its
all I axe

Waitin in the lorrel Old Gabe could hold back no longer Hits a
shame a burnin shame I don know whut things air comm to Pears
like all you young folks think about is killin somebody Folks usen
to talk about how fer they could kill a deer now its how fer they kin
kill a man I hev knowed the time when a man would a been druv out
o the county fer drawin a knife ur a pistol n ef a feller was ever
killed it was kinder accidental by a Barlow I reckon folks got use
to weepons n killin n bushwhackin in the war Looks like its been
gittin wuss ever sence n now hits dirk n Winchester n shootin
from the bushes all the time Hits wuss n stealin money to take a
fellercreetur s life that way

The old millers indignation sprang from memories of a better youth For
the courtesies of the code went on to the Blue Grass and before the
war the mountaineer fought with English fairness and his fists It was a
disgrace to use a deadly weapon in those days it was a disgrace now not
to use it

Oh I know all the excuses folks make he went on hits far fer one
as tis fer tother yu cant fight a man far n squar wholl shoot
you in the back a pore man cant fight money in the couhts n thar
haint no witnesses in the lorrel but leaves n dead men dont hev
much to say I know it all Hits curus but it actally looks like
lots o decent young folks hev got usen to the ideethars so much of
it goin on n thars so much talk bout killin n layin out in the
lorrel Reckon folks ll git to pesterm women n strangers bimeby n
robbin n thievin Hits bad enough thars so leetle law thet folks
hev to take it in their own hands oncet in a while but this shootin
from the breshhits pintly a sin n shame Why he concluded
pointing his remonstrance as he always did I seed your grandad and
young Jass fight up thar in Hazlan full two hours fore the warfist
and skulln your grandad was whooped They got up and shuk hands I
dont see why folks cant fight that way now I wish Rufe n old Jas
n you n young Jas could have it out fist and skull n stop this
killin o people like hogs Thars nobody left but you four But thars
no chance o that I reckon

Ill fight him anyway n I reckon ef he dont die till I lay out in
the lorrel fer him hell live a long time Ef a Stetson ever done sech
meanness as that I never heerd it

Nother hev I said the old man with quick justice You air a
overbearin race all o ye but I never knowed ye to be that mean
Hits all the wus fer ye thet ye air in sech doins I tell ye Rome

A faint cry rose above the drone of the millstones and old Gabe stopped
with open lips to listen The boys face was pressed close to the logs
A wet paddle had flashed into the sunlight from out the bushes across
the river He could just see a canoe in the shadows under them and with
quick suspicion his brain pictured Jaspers horse hitched in the bushes
and Jasper stealing across the river to waylay Rome But the canoe moved
slowly out of sight downstream and toward the deep water the paddler
unseen and the boy looked around with a weak smile Neither seemed to
have heard him Rome was brooding with his sullen face in his hands
the old miller was busy with his own thoughts and the boy turned again
to his watch

Jasper did not come Isoms eyes began to ache from the steady gaze and
now and then he would drop them to the water swirling beneath A slow
wind swayed the overhanging branches at the mouth of the stream and
under them was an eddy Escaping this the froth and bubbles raced out
to the gleams beating the air from the sunlit river He saw one tiny
fleet caught a mass of yellow scum bore down and sweeping through
bubbles and eddy was itself struck into fragments by something afloat
A tremulous shadow shot through a space of sunlight into the gloom cast
by a thicket of rhododendrons and the boy caught his breath sharply A
moment more and the shape of a boat and a human figure quivered on the
water running under him The stern of a Lewallen canoe swung into the
basin and he sprang to his feet

Rome The cry cut sharply through the drowsy air Thar he is Hits
Jas

The old miller rose to his feet The boy threw himself behind the sacks
of grain Rome wheeled for his rifle and stood rigid before the door
There was a light step without the click of a gunlock within a shadow
fell across the doorway and a girl stood at the threshold with an empty
bag in her hand




V

WITH a little cry she shrank back a step Her face paled and her lips
trembled and for a moment she could not speak But her eyes swept the
group and were fixed in two points of fire on Rome

Why dont ye shoot she asked scornfully

I hev heerd that the Stetsons have got to makin war on womenfolks but
I never believed it afore Then she turned to the miller

Kin I git some more meal hyeh she asked Or have ye stopped sellin
to folks on tother side she added in a tone that sought no favor

You kin have all ye want said old Gabe quietly

The mill on Dead Crick is broke agin she continued n con is
skeerce on our side Well have to begin buyin purty soon so I thought
Id save totin the con down hyeh She handed old Gabe the empty bag

Well said he as it air gittin late n ye have to climb the
mountain agin Ill let ye have that comm out o the hopper now Take
a cheer

The girl sat down in the low chair and loosening the strings of her
bonnet pushed it back from her head An oldfashioned horn comb dropped
to the floor and when she stooped to pick it up she let her hair fall
in a head about her shoulders Thrusting one hand under it she calmly
tossed the whole mass of chestnut and gold over the back of the chair
where it fell rippling like water through a bar of sunlight With head
thrown back and throat bared she shook it from side to side and
slowly coiling it pierced it with the coarse comb Then passing her
hands across her forehead and temples as women do she folded them in
her lap and sat motionless The boy crouched near held upon her the
mesmeric look of a serpent Old Gabe was peering covertly from under the
brim of his hat with a chuckle at his lips Rome had fallen back to a
corner of the mill sobered speechless his rifle in a nerveless hand
The passion that fired him at the boys warning had as swiftly gone down
at sight of the girl and her cutting rebuke made him hot again with
shame He was angry toomore than angrybecause he felt so helpless
a sensation that was new and stifling The scorn of her face as he
remembered it that morning hurt him again while he looked at her A
spirit of contempt was still in her eyes and quivering about her thin
lips and nostrils She had put him beneath further notice and yet every
toss of her head every movement of her hands seemed meant for him
to irritate him And once while she combed her hair his brain whirled
with an impulse to catch the shining stuff in one hand and to pinion
both her wrists with the other Just to show her that he was master and
still would harm her not at all But he shut his teeth and watched her
Among mountain women the girl was more than pretty elsewhere only her
hair perhaps would have caught the casual eye She wore red homespun
and coarse shoes her hands were brown and hardened Her arms and
shoulders looked muscular her waist was rather largebeing as nature
meant itand her face in repose had a heavy look But the poise of her
head suggested native pride and dignity her eyes were deep and full of
changing lights the scarlet dress loose as it was showed rich curves
in her figure and her movements had a certain childlike grace Her brow
was low and her mouth had character the chin was firm the upper lip
short and the teeth were even and white

I reckon thars enough to fill the sack Isom said the old miller
breaking the strained silence of the group The girl rose and handed him
a few pieces of silver

I reckon Id better pay fer it all she said I spose I wont be over
hyeh agin

Old Gabe gave some of the coins back

Yu know whut my price alays is he said

Im obleeged answered the girl flushing

Con hev riz on our side I thought mebbe you charged folks over thar
more anyways

I sells fer the same ef con is high ur low was the answer This
side or tother makes no diffunce to me I hev friens on both sides
n I take no part in sech doins as air a shame to the mountains

There was a quick light of protest in the girls dark eyes but the old
miller was honored by both factions and without a word she turned to
the boy who was tying the sack

The boats loose he called out with the string between his teeth
and she turned again and ran out Rome stood still

Kerry the sack out boy n holp the gal Old Gabes voice was stern
and the young mountaineer doggedly swung the bag to his shoulders The
girl had caught the rope and drawn the rude dugout along the shore

Who axed ye to do that she asked angrily

Rome dropped the bag into the boat and merely looked her in the face

Look hyeh Rome Stetsonthe sound of his name from her lips almost
startled himIll hev ye understan that I dont want to be bounden to
you nor none o yer kin

Turning she gave an impatient sweep with her paddle The prow of the
canoe dipped and was motionless Rome had caught the stern and the girl
wheeled in hot anger Her impulse to strike may have been for the
moment and no longer or she may have read swiftly no unkindness in the
mountaineers steady look for the uplifted oar was stayed in the air
as though at least she would hear him

Ive got nothin agin you he said slowly Jas Lewallen hev been
threatenin me n I thought it was him n I was ready fer him when
you come into the mill I wouldnt hurt you nur no other woman Yu
ought to know it n ye do know it

The words were masterful but said in a way that vaguely soothed the
girls pride and the oar was let slowly into the water

I reckon yu air a friend o his he added still quietly Ive seed
ye goin up thar but Ive got nothin agin ye whoever ye be

She turned on him a sharp look of suspicion I reckon I do be a friend
o hisn she said deliberately and then she saw that he was in
earnest A queer little smile went like a ray of light from her eyes
to her lips and she gave a quick stroke with her paddle The boat shot
into the current and was carried swiftly toward the Cumberland The
girl stood erect swaying through light and shadow like a great scarlet
flower blowing in the wind and Rome watched her till she touched the
other bank Swinging the sack out she stepped lightly after it and
without looking behind her disappeared in the bushes

The boy Isom was riding away when Rome turned and old Gabe was
watching from the door of the mill

Who is that gal he asked slowly It seemed somehow that he had known
her a long while ago A puzzled frown overlay his face and the old
miller laughed

You aaxin who she be n she aaxin who you be n both o ye
aknowin one nother sence ye was kneehigh Why boy hits old
Jaspers galMarthy




VI

IN a flash of memory Rome saw the girl as vividly as when he last saw
her years ago They had met at the mill he with his father she with
hers There was a quarrel and the two men were held apart But the old
sore as usual was opened and a week later Romes father was killed
from the brush He remembered his mothers rage and grief her calls for
vengeance the uprising the fights plots and ambushes He remembered
the look the girl had given him that long ago and her look that day was
little changed

When fighting began she had been sent for safety to the sister of her
dead mother in another county When peace came old Jasper married again
and the girl refused to come home Lately the stepmother too had
passed away and then she came back to live All this the old miller
told in answer to Romes questions as the two walked away in the
twilight This was why he had not recognized her and why her face yet
seemed familiar even when he crossed the river that morning

Uncle Gabe how do you reckon the gal knowed who I was

She axed me

She axed you Whar

Over thar in the mill The miller was watching the young mountaineer
closely The manner of the girl was significant when she asked who Rome
was and the miller knew but one reason possible for his foolhardiness
that morning

Do you mean to say she have been over hyeh afore

Why yes come to think about it three or four times while Isom was
sick and whut she come fer I cant make out The mill over thar wasnt
broke long n why she didnt go thar or bring more con at a time to
save her the trouble o so many trips I cant see to save me

Young Stetson was listening eagerly Again the miller cast his bait

Mebbe shes spyin

Rome faced him alert with suspicion but old Gabe was laughing
silently

Dont you be a fool Rome The gal comes and goes in that boat n
she couldnt see a soul without my knowin it She seed ye ridin by one
day n she looked mighty curus when I tole her who ye was

Old Gabe stopped his teasing Romes face was so troubled and himself
grew serious

Rome he said earnestly I wish to the good Lord ye wasnt in sech
doins Ef that had been young Jas stid o Marthy I reckon ye would
a killed him right thar

I wasnt going to let him kill me was the sullen answer

The two had stopped at a rickety gate swinging open on the road The
young mountaineer was pushing a stone about with the toe of his boot
He had never before listened to remonstrance with such patience and old
Gabe grew bold

Youve been drinkin agin Rome he said sharply n I know it
Hits been moonshine thats whooped you Stetsons not the Lewallens
long as I kin rickollect n it ull be moonshine agin ef ye dont let
it alone

Rome made no denial no defence Uncle Gabe he said slowly still
busied with the stone hev that gal been over hyeh sence yu tol her
who I was

The old man was waiting for the pledge that seemed on his lips but he
did not lose his temper

Not till today he said quietly

Rome turned abruptly and the two separated with no word of parting
For a moment the miller watched the young fellow striding away under his
rifle

I have been atter peace a good while he said to himself but I
reckon thars a bigger hand aworkin now than mine Then he lifted his
voice Ef Isoms too sick to come down to the mill tomorrer I wish
youd come n holp me

Rome nodded back over his shoulder and went on with head bent along
the river road Passing a clump of pines at the next curve he pulled a
bottle from his pocket

Uncle Gabes about right I reckon he said half aloud and he raised
it above his head to hurl it away but checked it in midair For a
moment he looked at the colorless liquid then with quick nervousness
pulled the cork of sassafras leaves gulped down the pale moonshine and
dashed the bottle against the trunk of a beech The fiery stuff does
its work in a hurry He was thirsty when he reached the mouth of a brook
that tumbled down the mountain along the pathway that would lead him
home and he stooped to drink where the water sparkled in a rift of
dim light from overhead Then he sat upright on a stone with his wide
hatbrim curved in a crescent over his forehead his hands caught about
his knees and his eyes on the empty air

He was scarcely over his surprise that the girl was young Lewallens
sister and the discovery had wrought a curious change The piquant
impulse of rivalry was gone and something deeper was taking its place
He was confused and a good deal troubled thinking it all over He
tried to make out what the girl meant by looking at him from the
mountainside by waving her bonnet at him and by coming to old Gabes
mill when she could have gone to her own To be sure she did not know
then who he was and she had stopped coming when she learned but why
had she crossed again that day Perhaps she too was bantering him and
he was at once angry and drawn to her for her mettlesome spirit touched
his own love of daring even when his humiliation was most bitterwhen
she told him he warred on women when he held out to her the branch
of peace and she swept it aside with a stroke of her oar But Rome was
little conscious of the weight of subtle facts like these His unseeing
eyes went back to her as she combed her hair He saw the color in her
cheeks the quick light in her eyes the naked full throat once more
and the wavering forces of his unsteady brain centred in a stubborn
resolutionto see it all again He would make Isom stay at home if need
be and he would take the boys place at the mill If she came there no
more he would cross the river again Come peace or war be she friend
or enemy he would see her His thirst was fierce again and with this
halfdrunken determination in his heart he stooped once more to drink
from the cheerful little stream As he rose a loud curse smote the air
The river pressed between two projecting cliffs was narrow at that
point and the oath came across the water An instant later a man led a
lamed horse from behind a bowlder and stooped to examine its leg The
dusk was thickening but Rome knew the huge frame and gray beard of old
Jasper Lewallen The blood beat in a sudden tide at his temples and
half by instinct he knelt behind a rock and thrusting his rifle
through a crevice cocked it softly

Again the curse of impatience came over the still water and old Jasper
rose and turned toward him The glistening sight caught in the centre of
his beard That would take him in the throat it might miss and he let
the sight fall till the bullet would cut the fringe of gray hair into
the heart Old Jasper so people said had killed his father in just
this way he had driven his uncle from the mountains he was trying
now to revive the feud He was the father of young Jasper who had
threatened his life and the father of the girl whose contempt had cut
him to the quick twice that day Again her taunt leaped through his
heated brain and his boast to the old miller followed it His finger
trembled at the trigger

No by  no he breathed between his teeth and old Jasper passed on
unharmed




VII

NEXT day the news of Rufe Stetsons flight went down the river on the
wind and before nightfall the spirit of murder was loosed on both
shores of the Cumberland The more cautious warned old Jasper The
Stetsons were gaining strength again they said so were their feudsmen
the Marcums enemies of the Braytons old Jaspers kinspeople Keeping
store Rufe had made money in the West and money and friends right
and left through the mountains With all his goodnature he was a
persistent hater and he was shrewd He had waited the chance to put
himself on the side of the law and now the law was with him But old
Jasper laughed contemptuously Rufe Stetson was gone again he said as
he had gone before and this time for good Rufe had tried to do
what nobody had done or could do while he was alive Anyway he was
reckless and he cared little if war did come again Still the old man
prepared for a fight and Steve Marcum on the other shore made ready for
Rufes return

It was like the breaking of peace in feudal days The close kin of each
leader were already about him and now the close friends of each took
sides Each leader trading in Hazlan had debtors scattered through the
mountains and these rallied to aid the man who had befriended them
There was no grudge but served a pretext for partisanship in the coming
war Political rivalry had wedged apart two strong families the Marcums
and Braytons a boundary line in dispute was a chain of bitterness a
suit in a country court had sown seeds of hatred Sometimes it was a
horsetrade a fence left down or a gate left open and the trespassing
of cattle in one instance through spite a neighbor had docked the
tail of a neighbors horsehad muled his critter as the owner
phrased the outrage There was no old sore that was not opened by the
crafty leaders no slumbering bitterness that they did not wake to life
Help us to revenge and we will help you was the whispered promise
So had one man a grudge against another he could set his foot on one
or the other shore sure that his enemy would be fighting for the other

Others there were friends of neither leader who under stress of
poverty or hatred of work would fight with either for food and clothes
and others still the neerdowells and outlaws who fought by the day
or month for hire Even these were secured by one or the other faction
for Steve and old Jasper left no resource untried knowing well that the
fight if there was one would be fought to a quick and decisive end
The day for the leisurely feud for patient planning and the slow
picking off of men from one side or the other was gone The people in
the Blue Grass who had no feuds in their own country were trying
to stop them in the mountain Over in Breathitt as everybody knew
soldiers had come from the settlemints had arrested the leaders
and had taken them to the Blue Grass for the feared and hated ordeal
of trial by a jury of bigoted furriners On the heels of the soldiers
came a young preacher up from the Jellico hills half citizen half
furriner with long black hair and a scar across his forehead who was
stirring up the people it was said as though Satan was atter them
Over there the spirit of the feud was broken and a good effect was
already perceptible around Hazlan In past days every pair of lips was
sealed with fear and the noncombatants left crops and homes and moved
down the river when trouble began Now only the timid considered this
way of escape Steve and old Jasper found a few men who refused to enter
the fight Several indeed talked openly against the renewal of the
feud and somebody it was said had dared to hint that he would send to
the Governor for aid if it should break out again But these were rumors
touching few people

For once again as time and time again before one bank of the
Cumberland was arrayed with mortal enmity against the other and old
Gabe sat with shaken faith in the door of his mill For years he had
worked and prayed for peace and for a little while the Almighty seemed
lending aid Now the friendly grasp was loosening and yet the miller
did all he could He begged Steve Marcum to urge Rufe to seek aid from
the law when the latter came back and Steve laughed and asked what
justice was possible for a Stetson with a Lewallen for a judge and
Braytons for a jury The miller pleaded with old Jasper and old Jasper
pointed to the successes of his own life

I hev triumphed agin my enemies time n agin he said The Lord
air on my side n I gits a better Christian ever year The old man
spoke with the sincerity of a barbarism that has survived the dark ages
and holding the same faith the miller had no answer It was old Gabe
indeed who had threatened to send to the Governor for soldiers and this
he would have done perhaps had there not been one hope left and only
one A week had gone and there was no word from Rufe Stetson Up on
Thunderstruck Knob the old Stetson mother was growing pitiably eager and
restless Every day she slipped like a ghost through the leafless woods
and in and out the cabin kindling hatred At every dawn or dusk she
was on her porch peering through the dim light for Rufe Stetson Steve
Marcum was ill at ease Rome Stetson alone seemed unconcerned and his
name was on every gossiping tongue

He took little interest and no hand in getting ready for the war He
forbade the firing of a gun till Rufe came back else Steve should fight
his fight alone He grew sullen and morose His old mothers look was a
thorn in his soul and he stayed little at home He hung about the mill
and when Isom became bedfast the big mountaineer who had never handled
anything but a horse a plough or a rifle settled himself to the
bewilderment of the Stetsons into the boys duties and nobody dared
question him Even old Gabe jested no longer The matter was too
serious

Meanwhile the winter threw off the last slumbrous mood of autumn as a
sleeper starts from a dream A fortnight was gone and still no message
came from the absent leader One shore was restive uneasy the other
confident mocking Between the two Rome Stetson waited his chance at
the mill




VIII

DAY was whitening on the Stetson shore Across the river the air was
still sharp with the chill of dawn and the mists lay like flocks of
sheep under shelter of rock and crag A peculiar cry radiated from the
Lewallen cabin with singular resonance on the crisp airthe mountain cry
for straying cattle A soft low came from a distant patch of laurel and
old Jaspers girl Martha folded her hands like a conch at her mouth
and the shrill cry again startled the air

Ye better come ye pieded cowbrute Picking up a cedar piggin she
stepped from the porch toward the meek voice that had answered her
Temper and exertion had brought the quick blood to her face Her head
was bare her thick hair was loosely coiled and her brown arms were
naked almost to the shoulder At the stable a young mountaineer was
overhauling his ridinggear

Air you goin to ride the hoss today Jas she asked querulously

Thats jes whut I was aimin to do Im agoin to town

Well I lowed I was goin to mill today The con is mos gone

Well yu lowed wrong he answered imperturbably

Yure mean Jas Lewallen she cried hotly thats whut ye air
meandogmean

The young mountaineer looked up whistled softly and laughed But when
he brought his horse to the door an hour later there was a bag of corn
across the saddle

As ye air so powerful sot on goin to mill whether or no Ill leave
this hyeh sack at the bend O the road n ye kin git it thar Ill
bring the meal back ef ye puts it in the same place I hates to see
womenfolks aridin this horse Hit spiles him

The horse was a dapplegray of unusual beauty and as the girl reached
out her hand to stroke his throat he turned to nibble at her arm

I reckon hed jes as lieve have me ride him as you Jas she said
Me n him have got to be great friends Ye orter nt to be so stingy

Well he aint no hoss to be left outn the bresh now n I haint
goin to low it

Old Jasper had lounged out of the kitchen door and stood with his huge
bulk against a shrinking pillar of the porch The two men were much
alike Both had the same black threatening brows meeting over the
bridge of the nose A kind of grim humor lurked about the old mans
mouth which time might trace about young Jaspers The girls face had
no humor the same square brows apart and clearly marked gave it a
strong serious cast and while she had the Lewallen fire she favored
her mother enough so the neighbors said to have a mighty mild takin
way about her ef she wanted

Youre right Jas the old mountaineer said the hoss air a sin n
temptation Hit do me good ever time I look at him Thar air no sech
hoss I tell ye this side o the settlements

The boy started away and the old man followed and halted him out of
the girls hearing

Tell Eli Crump n Jim Stover to watch the Breathitt road close now
he said in a low voice See all them citizens I tol ye n tell
em to be ready when I says the word Thars no tellin whuts goin to
happen

Young Jasper nodded his head and struck his horse into a gallop The
old man lighted his pipe and turned back to the house The girl bonnet
in hand was starting for the valley

Thar aint no use goin to Gabe Bunchs fer yer grist he said The
mill on Dead Cricks arunnin agin n I dont want ye over thar axin
favors specially jes now

I lef somethin fer ye to eat dad she replied ef ye gits hungry
before I git back

You heerd me he called after her knitting his brows

Yes dad I heerd ye she answered adding to herself But I dont
heed ye In truth the girl heeded nobody It was not her way to ask
consent even her own nor to follow advice At the bend of the road she
found the bag and for an instant she stood wavering An impulse turned
her to the river and she loosed the boat and headed it across the
swift shallow water from the ford and straight toward the mill At
every stroke of her paddle the water rose above the prow of the boat
and blown into spray flew back and drenched her the wind loosed her
hair and tugging at her skirts draped her like a statue and she
fought them wind and water with mouth set and a smile in her eyes
One sharp struggle still where the creek leaped into freedom the mouth
grew a little firmer the eyes laughed more the keel grated on pebbles
and the boat ran its nose into the withered sedge on the Stetson shore

A tall gray figure was pouring grain into the hopper when she reached
the door of the mill She stopped abruptly Rome Stetson turned and
again the two were face to face No greeting passed The girl lifted
her head with a little toss that deepened the set look about the
mountaineers mouth her lax figure grew tense as though strung suddenly
against some coming harm and her eyes searched the shadows without once
resting on him

Whars Uncle Gabe She spoke shortly and as to a stranger

Gone to town said Rome composedly He had schooled himself for this
meeting

Whens he comm back

Not fore night I reckon

Whars Isom

Isoms sick

Well whos tendin this mill

For answer he tossed the empty bag into the corner and without looking
at her picked up another bag

I reckon ye see me dont ye he asked coolly Hev a cheer and
rest a spell Hits a purty long climb whar you come from

The girl was confused She stayed in the doorway a little helpless
and suspicious What was Rome Stetson doing here His mastery of the
situation his easy confidence puzzled and irritated her Should she
leave The mountaineer was a Stetson a worm to tread on if it crawled
across the path It would be like backing down before an enemy He might
laugh at her after she was gone and at that thought she sat down in
the chair with composed face looking through the door at the tumbling
water which broke with a thousand tints under the sun but able still
to see Rome sidewise as he moved about the hopper whistling softly

Once she looked around fancying she saw a smile on his sober face
Their eyes came near meeting and she turned quite away

Ever seed a body outn his head

The girls eyes rounded with a start of surprise

Well its plumb curus Isoms been that way lately Isoms sick ye
know Uncle Gabes got the rheumatiz n Isoms mighty fond o Uncle
Gabe n the boy pestered me till I come down to hep him Hit pintly
air strange to hear him talkin Hes jes aravin bout hell n
heaven n the sin o killin folks Youd ha thought he hed been
convicted though none o our fambly hev been much atter religion He
says as how the wrath uv a livin God is agoin to sweep these mount
ins ef some mighty tall repentin haint done Of cose he got all them
notions from Gabe But Isom alays was quar n seed things hisself He
aint no fool

The girl was listening Morbidly sensitive to the supernatural she had
turned toward him and her face was relaxed with fear and awe

Hes havin dreams n sechlike now n I reckon thars nothing hes
seed or heerd that he don talk about Hes been agoin on about you
he added abruptly The girls hands gave a nervous twitch Oh he
dont say nothin agin ye I reckon he tuk a fancy to ye Mam was
plumb distracted not knowin whar he had seed ye She thought it was
like his other talk n I never let onaknowin how mam was A flush
rose like a flame from the girls throat to her hair But hits this
Rome went on in an unsteady tone that he talks most about n Im
sorry myself that troubles acomm He dropped all pretence now Ive
been awatchin fer ye over thar on t other shore a good deal lately I
didnt know ye at fust Marthyhe spoke her name for the first time
n Gabe says yu didnt know me I remembered ye though n I want
to tell ye now what I tol ye then Ive got nothin agin you I was
hopin ye mought come over aginhit was sorter curus that yu was the
same galthe same gal

His selfcontrol left him he was halting in speech and blundering
he did not know where Fumbling an empty bag at the hopper he had not
dared to look at the girl till he heard her move She had risen and
was picking up her bag The hard antagonism of her face calmed him
instantly

Haint ye goin to have yer grist ground

Not hyeh she answered quickly

Why gal He got no further Martha was gone and he followed her to
the bank bewildered

The girls suspicion lulled by his plausible explanation had grown
sharp again The mountaineer knew that she had been coming there He was
at the mill for another reason than to take the boys place and with
swift intuition she saw the truth

He got angry as she rode awayangry with himself that he had let her go
and the same halftender halfbrutal impulse seized him as when he saw
her first This time he yielded His horse was at hand and the river
not far below was narrow The bridlepath that led to the Lewallen
cabin swerved at one place to a cliff overlooking the river and by hard
riding and a climb of a few hundred feet on foot he could overtake her
halfway up the mountain steep

The plan was no more than shaped before he was in the saddle and
galloping down the river The set of his face changed hardly a line
while he swam the stream and drenched to the waist scaled the cliff
When he reached the spot he found the prints of a womans shoe in the
dust of the path going down There were none returning and he had
not long to wait A scarlet bit of color soon flashed through the gray
bushes below him The girl was without her bag of corn She was climbing
slowly and was looking at the ground as though in deep thought
Reckless as she was she had come to realize at last just what she had
done She had been pleased at first as would have been any woman when
she saw the big mountaineer watching her for her life was lonely
She had waved her bonnet at him from mere mischief She hardly knew it
herself but she had gone across the river to find out who he was She
had shrunk from him as from a snake thereafter and had gone no more
until old Jasper had sent her because the Lewallen mill was broken and
because she was a woman and would be safe from harm She had met him
then when she could not help herself But now she had gone of her own
accord She had given this Stetson a bitter enemy a chance to see her
to talk with her She had listened to him she had been on the point of
letting him grind her corn And he knew how often she had gone to the
mill and he could not know that she had ever been sent Perhaps he
thought that she had come to make overtures of peace friendship even
more The suspicion reddened her face with shame and her anger at him
was turned upon herself Why she had gone again that day she hardly
knew But if there was another reason than simple perversity it was the
memory of Rome Stetsons face when he caught her boat and spoke to her
in a way she could not answer The anger of the moment came with every
thought of the incident afterward and with it came too this memory of
his look which made her at once defiant and uneasy She saw him now
only when she was quite close and startled she stood still his stern
look brought her the same disquiet but she gave no sign of fear

Whuts the matter with ye

The question was too abrupt too savage and the girl looked straight at
him and her lips tightened with a resolution not to speak The movement
put him beyond control

Yu puts hell into me Marthy Lewallen yu puts downright hell into
me The words came between gritted teeth I want to take ye up n
throw ye off this cliff clean into the river n I reckon the next
minute Id jump off atter ye Yuve witched me gal I forgits who ye
air n who I be n sometimes I want to come over hyeh n kerry
ye outn these mountins n nuver come back You know whut Ive been
watchin the river fer sence the fust time I seed ye You know whut Ive
been astayin at the mill fer n Steve mad n mam ajowerinn
alookin over hyeh fer ye night n day Yu know whut Ive jes swum
over hyeh fer Whuts the matter with ye

Martha was not looking for a confession like this It took away
her shame at once and the passion of it thrilled her and left her
trembling While he spoke her lashes drooped quickly her face softened
and the color came back to it She began intertwining her fingers and
would not look up at him

Ef yu hates me like the rest uv ye why dont ye say it right out N
ef ye do hate me whut hev you been lookin cross the river fer n
ashakin yer bonnet at me n paddlin to Gabes fer yer grist when
the mill on Dead Cricks been arunnin n I know it Youve been
banterin me hev yethe blood rose to his eyes again Ye mustnt
fool with me gal by  ye mustnt Whut hev you been goin over thar
fer He even took a threatening step toward her and with a helpless
gesture stopped The girl was a little frightened Indeed she smiled
seeing her power over him she seemed even about to laugh outright
but the smile turned to a quick look of alarm and she bent her
head suddenly to listen to something below At last she did speak
Somebodys comm she said Youd better git out o the way she
went on hurriedly Somebodys comm I tell ye Dont ye hear

It was no ruse to get rid of him The girls eyes were dilating
Something was coming far below Rome could catch the faint beats of a
horses hoofs He was unarmed and he knew it was death for him to be
seen on that forbidden mountain but he was beyond caution and ready to
welcome any vent to his passion and he merely shook his head

Ef its Satan hisself I haint goin to run The hoofbeats came
nearer The rider must soon see them from the coil below

Rome hits Jas Hes got his rifle and hell kill ye n me too
The girl was white with distress She had called him by his name and
the tone was of appeal not anger The black look passed from his face
and he caught her by the shoulders with rough tenderness but she pushed
him away and without a word he sprang from the road and let himself
noiselessly down the cliff The hoofbeats thundered above his head and
Young Jaspers voice hailed Martha

This hyehs the bigges meal I ever straddled Why dnt ye git the
grist ground

For a moment the girl did not answer and Rome waited breathless
Wasnt the mill runnin Whynt ye go on cross the river

Thats whut I did said the girl quietly Uncle Gabe wasnt thar n
Rome Stetson was I wouldnt low him to grin the co n n so I toted
hit back

Rome Stetson The voice was lost in a volley of oaths

The two passed out of hearing and Rome went plunging down the mountain
swinging recklessly from one little tree to another and wrenching limbs
from their sockets out of pure physical ecstasy When he reached his
horse he sat down breathing heavily on a bed of moss with a strange
new yearning in his heart If peace should come Why not peace if Rufe
should not come back He would be the leader then and without him there
could be no war Old Jasper had killed his father He was too young at
the time to feel poignant sorrow now and somehow he could look even at
that death in a fairer way His father had killed old Jaspers brother
So it went back a Lewallen killed a Stetson that Stetson had killed a
Lewallen until one end of the chain of deaths was lost and the first
fault could not be placed though each clan put it on the other In
every generation there had been compromisesperiods of peace why not
now Old Gabe would gladly help him He might make friends with young
Jasper he might even end the feud And thenhe and Marthawhy not He
closed his eyes and for one radiant moment t all seemed possible And
then a gaunt image rose in the dream and only the image was left
It was the figure of his mother stern and silent through the years
opening her grim lips rarely without some curse against the Lewallen
race He remembered she had smiled for the first time when she heard of
the new troublethe flight of his uncle and the hope of conflict She
had turned to him with her eyes on fire and her old hands clinched She
had said nothing but he understood her look And nowGood God what
would she think and say if she could know what he had done His whole
frame twitched at the thought and with a nervous spring to escape it
he was on his feet and starting down the mountain

Close to the river he heard voices below him and he turned his horse
quickly aside into the bushes Two women who had been washing clothes
passed carrying white bundles home They were talking of the coming
feud

That ar young Stetson aint much like his dad said one Young Jas
has been adarin n abanterin him n he wont take it up They say
he air turnin out a plumb coward

When he reached the Stetson cabin three horses with drooping heads were
hitched to the fence All had travelled a long way One wore a mans
saddle on the others were thick blankets tied together with leathern
thongs

In the dark porch sat several men Through the kitchen door he could see
his mother getting supper Inside a dozen rifles leaned against the wall
in the firelight and about their butts was a pile of ammunition In the
doorway stood Rufe Stetson




IX

ALL were smoking and silent Several spoke from the shadows as Rome
stepped on the porch and Rufe Stetson faced him a moment in the
doorway and laughed

Seem kinder sprised he said with a searching look Wasnt lookin
for me I reckon Ill sprise sevral ef I hev goodluck

The subtlety of this sent a chuckle of appreciation through the porch
but Rome passed in without answer

Isom lay on his bed within the circle of light and his face in the
brilliant glow was white and his eyes shone feverishly Rome he
said excitedly Uncle Rufes hyeh n they laywayed him n
He paused abruptly His mother came in and at her call the mountaineers
trooped through the covered porch and sat down to supper in the
kitchen They ate hastily and in silence the mother attending their
wants and Rome helping her The meal finished they drew their chairs
about the fire Pipes were lighted and Rufe Stetson rose and closed the
door

Thars no use harryin the boy he said I reckon hell be too puny to
take a hand

The mother stopped clearing the table and sat on the rock hearth close
to the fire her withered lips shut tight about a lighted pipe and her
sunken eyes glowing like the coal of fire in its black bowl Now and
then she would stretch her knotted hands nervously into the flames or
knit them about her knees looking closely at the heavy faces about her
which had lightened a little with expectancy Rufe Stetson stood before
the blaze his hands clasped behind him and his huge figure bent in
reflection At intervals he would look with halfshut eyes at Rome who
Sat with troubled face outside the firelight Across the knees of Steve
Marcum the best marksman in the mountains lay the barrel of a new
Winchester Old Sam Day Rufes fatherinlaw and counsellor to the
Stetsons for a score of years sat as if asleep on the opposite side of
the fireplace from the old mother with his big square head pressed down
between his misshapen shoulders

The time hev come Rome Rufe spoke between the puffs of his pipe and
Romes heart quickened for every eye was upon him Thars goin to
be trouble now I hear as how young Jasper hev been talkin purty tall
about yelowin as how ye air afeard O him

Rome felt his mothers burning look He did not turn toward her nor
Rufe but his face grew sullen and his voice was low and harsh
I reckon hell find out about that when the time comes he said
quietlytoo quietly for the old mother stirred uneasily and
significant glances went from eye to eye Rufe did not look up from the
floor He had been told about Romes peculiar conduct and while the
reason for it was beyond guessing he knew the temper of the boy and
how to kindle it He had thrust a thorn in a tender spot and he let it
rankle How sorely it did rankle he little knew The voice of the woman
across the river was still in Romes ears Nothing cuts the mountaineer
to the quick like the name of coward It stung him like the lash of
an oxwhip then it smarted all the way across the river and up the
mountain Young Jasper had been charging him broadcast with cowardice
and Jaspers people no doubt believed it Perhaps his own didhis
uncle his mother The bare chance of such a humiliation set up an
inward rage He wondered how he could ever have been such a fool as to
think of peace The womans gossip had swept kindly impulses from his
heart with a fresh tide of bitterness and helpless now against its
current he sullenly gave way and let his passions loose to drift with
it

Whar d ye git the guns Rufe Steve was testing the action of the
Winchester with a kindling look as the click of the locks struck softly
through the silence

Jackson way up in Breathitt at the eend of the new road

No wonder yuve been gone so long

I had to wait thar fer the guns n I had to travel atter dark comm
back n lay outn the bresh by day Hits full eighty mile up thar

Air ye shore nobody seed ye

The question was from a Marcum who had come in late and several
laughed Rufe threw back his dusty coat which was ripped through the
lapel by a bullet

They seed me well nough fer that he said grimly and then he looked
toward Rome who thought of old Jasper and gave back a gleam of fierce
sympathy There were several nods of approval along with the laugh that
followed It was a surpriseso little consideration of an escape so
narrowfrom Rufe for as old Gabe said Rufe was big and goodnatured
and was not thought fit for leadership But there was a change in him
when he came back from the West He was quieter he laughed less No one
spoke of the difference it was too vague but every one felt it and it
had an effect His flight had made many uneasy but his return for that
reason brought a stancher fealty from these and this was evident now
All eyes were upon him and all tongues even old Sams waited now for
his to speak

Whut weve got to do weve got to do mighty quick he began at last
Things air changin I seed it over thar in Breathitt The soldiers
n that scarfaced Jellico preacher hev broke up the fightin over
thar n ef we dont watch out theyll be adoin it hyeh when we
start our leetle frolic We haint got no time to fool Old Jas knows
this as well as me n thars goin to be mighty leetle chance fer
em to layway n pick us off from the bresh Thars goin to be far
fightin fer once thank the Lord They bushwhacked us dunn the war
n theyve laywayed us n shot us to pieces ever sence but now ef
God Amightys willin the things agoin to be settled one way or
tother at last I reckon

He stopped a moment to think The mens breathing could be heard so
quiet was the room and Rufe went on telling in detail slowly as if to
himself the wrongs the Lewallens had done his people When he came to
old Jasper his voice was low and his manner was quieter than ever

Now old Jas have got to the pint whar he says as how nobody in this
county kin undersell him n stay hyeh Old Jas druv Bond Vickers outn
the mount ins fer tryin hit He druv Jess Hale away n them two air
our kin

The big mountaineer turned then and knocked the ashes from his pipe
His eyes grew a little brighter and his nostrils spread but with a
sweep of his arm he added still quietly

Y all know whut hes done

The gesture lighted memories of personal wrongs in every breast he had
tossed a firebrand among fagots and an angry light began to burn from
the eyes that watched him

Ye know too that he thinks he has played the same game with me but
ye dont know I reckon that he had ole Jim Stover n that misable
Eli Crump ahidin in the bushes to shoot meagain he grasped the torn
lapel that a body warned me to git away from Hazlan n the night I
left home they come thar to kill me n sarched the house n skeered
Mollie n the leetle gal most to death

The mountaineers selfcontrol was lost suddenly in a furious oath The
men did know but in fresh anger they leaned forward in their chairs
and twisted about with smothered curses The old woman had stopped
smoking and was rocking her body to and fro Her lips were drawn in
upon her toothless gums and her pipe was clinched against her sunken
breast The head of the old mountaineer was lifted and his eyes were
open and shining fiercely

I hear as how he says Im gone fer good Well I have been kinder
easygoin hatin to fight but sence the day I seed Romes dad thar
dead in his blood I hev had jes one thing I wanted to do Thar wasnt
no use stayin hyeh I seed that Rome thar was too leetle and they was
too many fer me I knowed it was easier to git a new start out West
n when I come back to the mountin hit was to do jeswhut
Imgoingtodonow He wheeled suddenly upon Rome with one huge
hand lifted Under it the old womans voice rose in a sudden wail

Yes n I want to see it done befoh I die I haint hyeh fer long but
I haint goin to leave as long as ole Jas is hyeh n I want ye all to
know it Ole Jas hev got to go fust You hear me Rome Im atalkin to

The frenzied chant raised Rome from his chair Rufe himself took up the
spirit of it and his voice was above all caution

Yes Rome They killed him boy They sneaked on him n shot him to
pieces from the bushes Yes hits yo time now Look hyeh boys
He reached above the fireplace and took down an old riflehis
brotherswhich the old mother had suffered no one to touch He held
it before the fire pointing to two crosses made near the flashpan
Thars one fer ole Jim Lewallen Thars one fer ole Jas He got Jim
but ole Jas has got him n thars his cross thar yit Whars yo gun
Rome Shame on ye boy

The wildeyed old woman was before him She had divined Rufes purpose
and was already at his side with Romes Winchester in one hand and a
claspknife in the other Every man was on his feet the door was open
and the boy Isom was at the threshold his eyes blazing from his white
face Rome had strode forward

Yes boy nows the time right hyeh before us all

The mother had the knife outstretched Rome took it and the scratch of
the point on the hard steel went twice through the stillnessone more
fer the young un the voice was the old mothersthen twice again

The moon was sinking when Rome stood in the door alone The tramp of
horses was growing fainter down the mountain The trees were swaying in
the wind below him and he could just see the gray cliffs on the other
shore The morning seemed far away it made him dizzy looking back to it
through the tumult of the day Somewhere in the haze was the vision of
a girls white facewhite with distress for him Her father and her
brother he had sworn to kill He had made a cross for each and each
cross was an oath He closed the door and then he gave way and sat
down with his head in both hands The noises in the kitchen ceased The
fire died away and the chill air gathered about him When he rose the
restless eyes of the boy were upon him from the shadows

IT was courtday in Hazlan but so early in the morning nothing was
astir in the town that hinted of its life on such a day But for the
ring of a blacksmiths anvil on the quiet air and the fact that nowhere
was a churchspire visible a stranger would have thought that the
peace of Sabbath overlay a village of Godfearing people A burly figure
lounged in the porch of a rickety house and yawned under a swinging
sign the rude letters of which promised private entertainment for
the traveller unlucky enough to pass that way In the one long narrow
main street closely flanked by log and framed houses nothing else
human was in sight Out from this street and in an empty square stood
the one brick building in the place the courthouse brick without
brick within unfinished unpencilled unpainted panes out of the
windows a shutter off here and there or swinging drunkenly on one
hinge the door wide op en as though there was no privacy withina poor
structure with the look of a good man gone shiftless and fast going
wrong

Soon two or three lank brown figures appeared from each direction on
foot then a horseman or two and by and by mountaineers came in groups
on horse and on foot In time the side alleys and the courthouse square
were filled with horses and mules and even steers The mountaineers
crowded the narrow street idling from side to side squatting for a
bargain on the wooden sidewalks grouping on the porch of the rickety
hotel and on the courthouse steps loitering in and out of the one
store in sight Out in the street several stood about a horse looking
at his teeth holding his eyes to the sun punching his ribs twisting
his tail while the phlegmatic owner sat astride the submissive beast
and spoke short answers to rare questions Everybody talked politics
the crop failure or the last fight at the seat of some private war but
nobody spoke of a Lewallen or a Stetson unless he knew his listeners
heart and said it in a whisper For nobody knew when the powder would
flash or who had taken sides or that a careless word might not array
him with one or the other faction

A motley throng it wasin brown or gray homespun with trousers
in cowhide boots and slouched hats with brims curved according to
temperament but with striking figures in it the patriarch with long
white hair shorn even with the base of the neck and bearded only
at the throata justice of the peace and the sage of his district a
little mountaineer with curling black hair and beard and dark fine
features a grizzled giant with a head rugged enough to have been
carelessly chipped from stone a bragging candidate claiming everybodys
notice a squareshouldered fellow surging through the crowd like a
stranger an openfaced devilmaycare young gallant on fire with
moonshine a skulking figure with brutish mouth and shifting eyes
Indeed every figure seemed distinct for living apart from his
neighbor and troubling the law but little in small matters of dispute
the mountaineer preserves independence and keeps the edges of his
individuality unworn Apparently there was not a woman in town Those
that lived there kept housed and the fact was significant Still it
was close to noon and yet not a Stetson or a Lewallen had been seen
The stores of Rufe and old Jasper were at the extremities of the town
and the crowd did not move those ways It waited in the centre and
whetted impatience by sly trips in twos and three to stables or side
alleys for mountain dew Now and then the sheriff a little man with a
mighty voice would appear on the courthouse steps and summon a witness
to court where a frightened judge gave instructions to a frightened
jury But few went unless called for the interest was outside every
man in the streets knew that a storm was nigh and was waiting to see it
burst

Noon passed A hoarse bell and a whining hound had announced dinner
in the hotel The guests were coming again into the streets Eyes were
brighter faces a little more flushed and the moonshine was passed
more openly Both ways the crowd watched closely The quiet at each end
of the street was ominous and the delay could last but little longer
The lookerson themselves were getting quarrelsome The vent must come
soon or among them there would be trouble

Thar comes Jas Lewallen At last A dozen voices spoke at once A
horseman had appeared far down the street from the Lewallen end The
clouds broke from about the sun and a dozen men knew the horse that
bore him for the gray was prancing the street sidewise and throwing
the sunlight from his flanks Nobody followed and the crowd was
puzzled Young Jasper carried a Winchester across his saddlebow and
swaying with the action of his horse came on

What air he about

Hes a plumb idgit

He mus be crazy

Hes drunk

The wonder ceased Young Jasper was reeling Two or three Stetsons
slipped from the crowd and there was a galloping of hoofs the other
way Another horseman appeared from the Lewallen end riding hastily
The newcomers errand was to call Jasper back But the young daredevil
was close to the crowd and was swinging a bottle over his head

Come back hyeh Jas Come hyeh The newcomer was shouting afar off
while he galloped Horses were being untethered from the side alleys
Several more Lewallen riders came in sight They could see the gray
shining in the sunlight amid the crowd and the man sent after him
halted at a safe distance gesticulating and they too spurred
forward

Hello boys young Jasper was calling out as he swayed from side to
side the people everywhere giving him way

Fun today by  fun today Wholl hev a drink Hyehs hell to the
Stetsons whar some of em ll be afore night

With a swagger he lifted the bottle to his lips and stopping short
let it fall untouched to the ground He had straightened in his saddle
and was looking up the street With a deep curse he threw the Winchester
to his shoulder fired and before his yell had died on his lips horse
and rider were away like a shaft of light The crowd melted like magic
from the street The Stetsons chiefly on foot did not return the
fire but halted up the street as if parleying Young Jasper joined his
party and they too stood still a moment puzzled by the irresolution
of the other side

Watch out theyre gittin round ye Run for the courthouse ye
foolsye run The voice came in a loud yell from somewhere down the
street and its warning was just in time

A wreath of smoke came about a corner of the house far down the street
and young Jasper yelled and dashed up a side alley with his followers
A moment later judge jury witnesses and sheriff were flying down the
courthouse steps at the point of Lewallen guns the Lewallen horses
led by the gray were snorting through the streets their riders
barricaded in the forsaken courthouse were puffing a stream of fire
and smoke from every window of courtroom below and juryroom above

The streets were a bedlam The Stetsons were yelling with triumph The
Lewallens were divided and Rufe placed three Stetsons with Winchesters
on each side of the courthouse and kept them firing Rome pale and
stern hid his force between the square and the Lewallen store He
was none too quick The rest were coming on led by old Jasper It was
reckless riding that way right into death but the old man believed
young Jaspers life at stake and the men behind asked no questions when
old Jasper led them The horses hoofs beat the dirt street like
the crescendo of thunder The fierce old mans hat was gone and his
manelike hair was shaking in the wind Louderand still the Stetsons
were quietquiet too long The wily old man saw the trap and with
a yell whirled the column up an alley each man flattening over his
saddle From every window from behind every corner and tree smoke
belched from the mouth of a Winchester Two horses went down one
screamed the other struggled to his feet and limped away with an empty
saddle One of the fallen men sprang into safety behind a house and one
lay still with his arms stretched out and his face in the dust

From behind barn house and fence the Lewallens gave back a scattering
fire but the Stetsons crept closer and were plainly in greater
numbers Old Jasper was being surrounded and he mounted again and all
followed by a chorus of bullets and triumphant yells fled for a wooded
slope in the rear of the courthouse A dozen Lewallens were prisoners
and must give up or starve There was savage joy in the Stetson crowd
and manyfooted rumor went all ways that night

Despite sickness and Romes strict order Isom had ridden down to the
mill Standing in the doorway he and old Gabe saw up the river where
the water broke into foam over the ford a riderless gray horse plunging
across Later it neighed at a gate under Wolfs Head and Martha
Lewallen ran out to meet it Across under Thunderstruck Knob that
night the old Stetson mother listened to Isoms story of the fight with
ghastly joy in her deathmarked face




XI

ALL night the courthouse was guarded and on guard At one corner of
the square Rufe Stetson with a few men sat on watch in old Sam Days
cabinthe fortress of the town built for such a purpose and used for
it many times before The prisoners too were alert and no Stetson
ventured into the open square for the moon was high an exposure
anywhere was noted instantly by the whistle of a rifleball and the
mountaineer takes few risks except under stress of drink or passion
Rome Stetson had placed pickets about the town wherever surprise was
possible All night he patrolled the streets to keep his men in such
readiness as he could for the attack that the Lewallens would surely
make to rescue their living friends and to avenge the dead ones

But the triumph was too great and unexpected Two Braytons were dead
several more were prisoners with young Jasper in the courthouse and
drinking began

As the night deepened without attack the Stetsons drank more and grew
reckless A dance was started Music and moonshine were given to every
man who bore a Winchester The night was broken with drunken yells the
random discharge of firearms and the monotone of heavy feet The two
leaders were helpless and the inaction of the Lewallens puzzled them
Chafed with anxiety they kept their eyes on the courthouse or on the
thicket of gloom where their enemies lay But the woods were as quiet
as the pall of shadows over them Once Rome making his rounds saw a
figure crawling through a field of corn It looked like Crumps but
before he could fire the man rolled like a ball down the bushy bank
to the river An instant later some object went swiftly past a side
streetsomebody on horsebackand a picket fired an alarm The horse
kept on and Rome threw his rifle on a patch of moonlight but when the
object flashed through his finger was numbed at the trigger In the
moonlight the horse looked gray and the rider was seated sidewise A
bullet from the courthouse clipped his hatbrim as he ran recklessly
across the street to where Steve Marcum stood in the dark behind old
Sams cabin

Jim Hale ll git him as he goes up the road said Steve calmlyand
then with hot impatience Why the hell dont he shoot

Rome started forward in the moonlight and Steve caught his arm Two
bullets hissed from the courthouse and he fell back

A shot sounded from the bushes far away from the road The horse kept
on and splashed into Troubled Fork and Steve swore bitterly

Hit haint Jim Hits that misable Bud Vickers hes been astan din
guard outn the bushes stid o the road That was a spy I tell ye n
the coward let him in and let him out Theyll know now were all drunk
Whuts the matter

Romes mouth was half open He looked white and sick and Steve thought
he had been hit but he took off his hat Purty close he said with
a laugh pointing at the bullethole through the brim

Steve unsuspicious went on Hit was a spy I tell ye Bud was afeard
to stan in the road n Im goin out thar n twist his damned neck
Weve got em Rome I tell ye weve got em Ef we kin git through
this night and git the boys sober in the morning weve got em shore

The night did pass in safety darkness wore away without attack and
morning broke on the town in its drunken stupor Then the curious
silence of the Lewallens was explained The rumor came that old Jasper
was dead and it went broadcast Later friends coming to the edge of
the town for the bodies of the dead Lewallens confirmed it A random
ball had passed through old Lewallens body in the wild flight for the
woods and during the night he had spent his last breath in a curse
against the man who fired it

Then each Stetson waked from his drunken sleep drank again when he
heard of the death The day bade fair to be like the night and again
the anxiety of the leaders was edged with fear Old Jasper dead and
young Jasper a prisoner the chance was near to end the feud or there
would be no Lewallen left to lead their enemies But again they were
wellnigh helpless Already they had barely enough men to guard their
prisoners Of the Marcums Steve alone was able to handle a Winchester
and outside the sounds of the carousal were in the air and growing
louder In a little while if the Lewallens but knew it escape would be
easy and the Stetsons could be driven from the town

Oh they know it said Steve Theyll be awhoopin down out O them
woods purty soon n we re goin to ketch hell Id like to know mighty
well who that spy was last night That cussed Bud Vickers says it was a
hant on a white hoss with long hair flyin in the wind n that he
shot plumb through it I jus wish Id a had a chance at it

Still noon came again without trouble and the imprisoned Lewallens
had been twentyfour hours without food Their ammunition was getting
scarce The firing was less frequent though the watch was as close as
ever and twice a Winchester had sounded a signal of distress All knew
that a response must come soon and come it did A picket watching the
river road saw young Jaspers horse coming along the dark bushes far up
the river and brought the news to the group standing behind old Sams
cabin The gray galloped into sight and skirting the woods came
straight for the townwith a woman on his back The stirrup of a mans
saddle dangled on one side and the womans bonnet had fallen from her
head Some one challenged her

Stop I tell ye Dont ye go near that courthouse Stop I tell ye Ill
shoot Stop

Rome ran from the cabin with a revolver in each hand A drunken
mountaineer was raising a Winchester to his shoulder and springing
from the back of the gray at the courthouse steps was Martha Lewallen

Ill kill the fust man that lifts his finger to hurt the gal Rome
said knocking the drunken mans gun in the air We haint fightin
women

It was too late to oppose her and the crowd stood helplessly watching
No one dared approach so shielding with her body the space of the
opening door she threw the sack of food within Then she stood a moment
talking and turning climbed to her saddle The gray was spotted with
foam and showed the red of his nostrils with every breath as with face
flushed and eyes straight before her she rode slowly toward the crowd
What was she about Rome stood rigid his forgotten pistols hanging at
each side the mouth of the drunken mountaineer was open with stupid
wonder the rest fell apart as she came around the corner of the cabin
and through the space given rode slowly her skirt almost brushing
Rome looking neither to the right nor to the left and when she had
gone quite through them all she wheeled and rode still slowly through
the open fields toward the woods which sheltered the Lewallens while
the crowd stood in bewildered silence looking after her Yells of
laughter came from the old courthouse Some of the Stetsons laughed
too some swore a few grumbled but there was not one who was not
stirred by the superb daring of the girl though she had used it only to
show her contempt

Rome youre a fool though fer a fac we cant shoot a woman n
anyways I ruther shoot her than the hoss But lemme tell ye thar was
moren sumpn to eat in that bag They air up to some dodge

Rufe Stetson had watched the incident through a porthole of the cabin
and his tone was at once jesting and anxious

That grub wont last moren one day I reckon said the drunken
mountaineer Well watch out fer the gal nex time Were boun to git
em one time or tother

She rid through us to find out how many of us wasnt dead drunk said
Steve Marcum still watching the girl as she rode on toward the woods
n Im athinkin theyll be down on us purty soon now n I reckon
well have to run fer it Look thar boys

The girl had stopped at the edge of the woods facing the town she
waved her bonnet high above her head

Well whut in the he said with slow emphasis and then he leaped
from the door with a yell The bonnet was a signal to the beleaguered
Lewallens The rear door of the courthouse had been quietly opened and
the prisoners were out in a body and scrambling over the fence before
the pickets could give an alarm The sudden yells the crack of
Winchesters startled even the revellers and all who could headed by
Rome and Steve Marcum sprang into the square and started in pursuit
But the Lewallens had got far ahead and were running in zigzag lines to
dodge the balls flying after them Halfway to the woods was a gully
of red clay and into this the fleetest leaped and turned instantly to
cover their comrades The Winchesters began to rattle from the woods
and the bullets came like rain from everywhere

Thup Thup Thup there were three of themthe peculiar soft
dull messages of hot lead to living flesh A Stetson went down another
stumbled Rufe Stetson climbing the fence caught at his breast with
an oath and fell back Rome and Steve dropped for safety to the ground
Every other Stetson turned in a panic and every Lewallen in the gully
leaped from it and ran under the Lewallen fire for shelter in the
woods The escape was over

That was a purty neat trick said Steve wiping a red streak from his
cheek Nex time she tries that shell git herself into trouble

At nightfall the wounded leader and the dead one were carried up the
mountain each to his home and there was mourning far into the night
on one bank of the Cumberland and serious though Rufe Stetsons wound
was exultation on the other But in it Rome could take but little part
There had been no fault to find with him in the fight But a reaction
had set in when he saw the girl flash in the moonlight past the sights
of his Winchester and her face that day had again loosed within him a
flood of feeling that drove the lust for revenge from his veins Even
now while he sat in his own cabin his thoughts were across the river
where Martha broken at last sat at her death vigils He knew what her
daring ride that day had cost her with old Jasper dead out there in the
woods and as she passed him he had grown suddenly humbled shamed He
grew heartsick now as he thought of it all and the sight of his mother
on her bed in the corner close to death as she was filled him with
bitterness There was no help for him He was alone now pitted against
young Jasper alone On one bed lay his unclenigh to death There
was the grim figure in the corner the implacable spirit of hate and
revenge His rifle was against the wall If there was any joy for him in
old Jaspers death it was that his hand had not caused it and yetGod
help himthere was the other cross the other oath




XII

THE star and the crescent were swinging above Wolfs Head and in the
dark hour that breaks into dawn a cavalcade of Lewallens forded the
Cumberland and galloped along the Stetson shore At the head rode young
Jasper and Crump the spy

Swift changes had followed the courthouse fight In spite of the death
of Rufe Stetson from his wound and several other Stetsons from ambush
the Lewallens had lost ground Old Jaspers store had fallen into
the hands of creditorsfurrinersfor debts and it was said his
homestead must follow In a private war a leader must be more than
leader He must feed and often clothe his followers and young Jasper
had not the means to carry on the feud The famine had made corn dear
He could feed neither man nor horse and the hired feudsmen fell away
leaving the Lewallens and the Braytons and their close kin to battle
alone So Jasper avoided open combat and resorted to ambush and
surprise and knowing in some way every move made by the Stetsons with
great daring and success It was whispered too that he no longer cared
who owned what he might want for himself Several dark deeds were traced
to him In a little while he was a terror to good citizens and finally
old Gabe asked aid of the Governor Soldiers from the settlements were
looked for any day and both factions knew it At the least this would
delay the war and young Jasper had got ready for a last fight which
was close at hand

Half a mile on the riders swerved into a wooded slope There they hid
their horses in the brush and climbed the spur stealthily The naked
woods showed the cuplike shape of the mountains therea basin from
which radiated upward wooded ravines edged with ribs of rock In this
basin the Stetsons were encamped The smoke of a fire was visible in the
dim morning light and the Lewallens scattered to surround the camp but
the effort was vain A picket saw the creeping figures his gun echoed
a warning from rock to rock and with yells the Lewallens ran forward
Rome sprang from his sleep near the fire bareheaded rifle in hand his
body plain against a huge rock and the bullets hissed and spat about
him as he leaped this way and that firing as he sprang and shouting
for his men Steve Marcum alone answered Some startled from sleep
had fled in a panic some had run deeper into the woods for shelter And
bidding Steve save himself Rome turned up the mountain running
from tree to tree and dropped unhurt behind a fallen chestnut Other
Stetsons too had turned and answering bullets began to whistle to
the enemy but they were widely separated and ignorant of one anothers
position and the Lewallens drove them one by one to new hidingplaces
scattering them more To his right Rome saw Steve Marcum speed like
a shadow up through a little open space but he feared to move for
several Lewallens had recognized him and were watching him alone He
could not even fire at the least exposure there was a chorus of bullets
about his ears In a moment they began to come obliquely from each
sidethe Lewallens were getting around him In a moment more death was
sure there and once again he darted up the mountain The bullets sang
after him like maddened bees He felt one cut his hat and another sting
his left arm but he raced up up till the firing grew fainter as he
climbed and ceased an instant altogether Then still farther below
came a sudden crash of reports Stetsons were pursuing the men who were
after him but he could not join them The Lewallens were scattered
everywhere between him and his own man and a descent might lead him to
the muzzle of an enemys Winchester So he climbed over a ledge of rock
and lay there peeping through a crevice between two bowlders gaining
his breath The firing was far below him now and was sharp Evidently
his pursuers were too busy defending themselves to think further of him
and he began to plan how he should get back to his friends But he kept
hidden and searching the cliffs below him for a sheltered descent he
saw something like a slouched hat just over a log scarcely fifty feet
below him Presently the hat was lifted a few inches a figure rose
cautiously and climbed toward the ledge shielding itself behind rock
and tree Very quietly Rome crawled back to the face of the cliff behind
him and crouched behind a rock with his cocked rifle across his knees
The man must climb over the ledge there would be a bare level floor
of rock between themthe Lewallen would be at his mercyand Rome with
straining eyes waited There was a footfall on the other side of the
ledge a soft clink of metal against stone The Lewallen was climbing
slowlyslowly Rome could hear his heavy breathing A grimy hand slipped
over the sharp comb of the ledge another appeared clinched about a
Winchesterthen the slouched hat and under it the dark crafty face of
young Jasper Rome sat like the stone before him with a halfsmile on
his lips Jasper peered about with the sly caution of a fox and his
face grew puzzled and chagrined as he looked at the cliffs above him

Stop thar

He was drawing himself over the ledge and the low stern voice startled
him as a knife might have done thrust suddenly from the empty air at
his breast Rome rose upright against the cliff with his resolute face
against the stock of a Winchester

Drap that gun

The order was given along Stetsons barrel and the weapon was dropped
the steel ringing on the stone floor Rome lowered his gun to the hollow
of his arm and the two young leaders faced each other for the first
time in the life of either

Seem kinder sprised to see me said the Stetson grimly Hev ye got
a pistol

Young Jasper glared at him in helpless ferocity

Naw

Knife

He drew a longbladed penknife from his pocket and tossed it at Romes
feet

Jes move over thar will ye

The Lewallen took his stand against the cliff Rome picked up the fallen
rifle and leaned it against the ledge

Now Jas Lewallen thars nobody left in this leetle trouble cept you
n me n ef one of us was dead I reckon tother could live hyeh n
thard be peace in these mountins I thought o that when I had ye at
the eend o this Winchester I reckon you would a shot me dead ef I
had poked my head over a rock as keerless as you That is just what
he would have done and Jasper did not answer Ive swore to kill ye
too added Rome tapping his gun Ive got a cross fer ye hyeh

The Lewallen was no coward Outcry or resistance was useless The
Stetson meant to taunt him to make death more bitter for Jasper
expected death and he sullenly waited for it against the cliff

Youve been banterin me a long time now lowin as how ye air the
better man o the two n Ive got a notion o givin ye a chance to
prove yer tall talk Hits not our way to kill a man in cold blood n
I dont want to kill ye anyways ef I kin hep it Seem sprised agin
Reckon ye dont believe me I dont wonder when I think o my own dad
n all the meanness yo folks have done mine but Ive got a good reason
fer not killin yeef I kin hep it Yu dont know what it is n
yull never know but Ill give yer a chance now fer yer life ef yull
swar on a stack o Bibles as high as that tree thar that yull leave
these mountins ef I whoops ye n nuver come back agin as long as you
live Ill leave ef ye whoops me Now whut do ye say Will ye swar

I reckon I will seem as Ive got to was the surly answer But
Jaspers face was dark with suspicion and Rome studied it keenly The
Lewallens once had been men whose word was good but he did not like
Jaspers look

I reckon Ill trust ye he said at last more through confidence in
his own strength than faith in his enemy for Jasper whipped would be as
much at his mercy as he was now So Rome threw off his coat and began
winding his homespun suspenders about his waist Watching him closely
Jasper did the same

The firing below had ceased A flock of mountain vultures were sailing
in great circles over the thick woods Two eagles swept straight from
the rim of the sun above Wolfs Head beating over a turbulent sea
of mist for the cliffs scarcely fifty yards above the ledge where
a pinetree grew between two rocks At the instant of lighting they
wheeled away each with a warning scream to the other A figure lying
flat behind the pine had frightened them and now a face peeped to one
side flushed with eagerness over the coming fight Both were ready now
and the Lewallen grew suddenly white as Rome turned again and reached
down for the guns

I reckon Ill put em a leetle furder out o the way he said kicking
the knife over the cliff and standing on a stone he thrust them into
a crevice high above his head

Now Jas well fight this gredge out as our grandads have done afore
us

Lewallen and Stetson were man to man at last Suspicion was gone now
and a short brutal laugh came from the cliff

Ill fight ye Oh by God Ill fight ye

The ring of the voice struck an answering gleam from Romes gray eyes
and the two sprang for each other It was like the struggle of primeval
men who had not yet learned even the use of clubs For an instant both
stood close like two wild beasts crouched for a spring and circling
about to get at each others throats with mouths set eyes watching
eyes and hands twitching nervously Young Jasper leaped first and the
Stetson wary of closing with him shrank back There were a few quick
heavy blows and the Lewallen was beaten away with blood at his lips
Then each knew the advantage of the other The Stetsons reach was
longer the Lewallen was shorter and heavier and again he closed in
Again Rome sent out his long arm A turn of Jaspers head let the heavy
fist pass over his shoulder The force of the blow drove Rome forward
the two clinched and Jaspers arms tightened about the Stetsons waist
With a quick gasp for breath Rome loosed his hold and bending his
enemys head back with one hand rained blow after blow in his face
with the other One terrible stroke on the jaw and Jaspers arms were
loosed the two fell apart the one stunned the other breathless One
dazed moment only and for a third time the Lewallen came on Rome had
been fighting a man now he faced a demon Jaspers brows stood out like
bristles and the eyes under them were red and fierce like a mad bulls
Again Romes blows fell but again the Lewallen reached him and this
time he got his face under the Stetsons chinid the heavy fist fell
upon the back of his head and upon his neck as upon wood and leather
Again Rome had to gasp for breath and again the two were fiercely
lockedtheir corded arms as tense as serpents Around and around they
whirled straining tripping breaking the silence only with deep quick
breaths and the stamping of feet Jasper firm on the rock and Romes
agility saving him from being lifted in the air and tossed from the
cliff There was no pause for rest It was a struggle to the end and
a quick one and under stress of excitement the figure at the pinetree
had risen to his kneesjumping even to his feet in plain view when
the short strong arms of the Lewallen began at last to draw Rome closer
still and to bend him backward The Stetson was giving way at last
The Lewallens vindictive face grew blacker and his white teeth showed
between his snarling lips as he fastened one leg behind his enemys
and with chin against his shoulder bent him slowly slowly back The
two breathed in short painful gasps their swollen muscles trembled
under the strain as with ague Backbackthe Stetson was falling
he seemed almost down whenthe trick is an old onewhirling with the
quickness of light he fell heavily on his opponent and caught him by
the throat with both hands

Nough he asked hoarsely It was the first word uttered

The only answer was a fierce struggle Rome felt the Lewallens teeth
sinking in his arm and his fingers tightened like twisting steel till
Jasper caught his breath as though strangling to death

Nough asked the hoarse voice again

No answer tighter clinched the fingers The Lewallen shook his head
feebly his purple face paled suddenly as Rome loosed his hold and his
lips moved in a whisper

Nough

Rome rose dizzily to one knee Jasper turned gasping and lay with his
face to the rock For a while both were quiet Rome panting with
open mouth and white with exhaustion looking down now and then at the
Lewallen whose face was turned away with shame

The sun was blazing above Wolfs Head now and the stillness about them
lay unbroken on the woods below

Ive whooped ye Jas Rome said at last Ive whooped ye in a far
fight n Ive got nothin now to say bout yer tall talk n I reckon
you hevnt nuther Now hits understood haint it that yull leave
these mountins

Yu kin go West he continued as the Lewallen did not answer Uncle
Rufe used to say thars a good deal to do out thar n nobody axes
questions Thars nobody left hyeh but you n me but these mountins
was never big nough fer one Lewallen n one Stetson n youve got to
go I reckon ye wont believe me but Im glad I didnt hev to kill
ye But youve promised to go now n Ill take yer word fer it
He turned his face and the Lewallen knowing it from the sound of his
voice sprang to his feet

Oh

A wild curse burst from Romes lips and both leaped for the guns The
Lewallen had the start of a few feet and Rome lamed in the fight
stumbled and fell Before he could rise Jasper had whirled with one of
the Winchesters above his head and his face aflame with fury Asking no
mercy Rome hid his face with one arm and waited stricken faint all at
once and numb One report struck his ears muffled whiplike A dull
wonder came to him that the Lewallen could have missed at such close
range and he waited for another Some one shouteda shrill hallo A
loud laugh followed a light seemed breaking before Romes eyes and
he lifted his head Jasper was on his face again motionless and Steve
Marcums tall figure was climbing over a bowlder toward him

That was the best fight Ive seed in my time by God he said coolly
n Rome yu air the biggest fool this side o the settlements I
reckon I had dead aim on him n I was jest athinkin hit was a purty
good thing fer you that old longnosed Jim Stover chased me up hyeh
when damn me ef that boy up thar didnt let his ole gun loose Id
agot Jas myself ef he hadnt been so allfired quick o trigger

Up at the root of the pinetree Isom stood motionless with his long
rifle in one hand and a little cloud of smoke breaking above his white
face When Rome looked up he started down without a word Steve swung
himself over the ledge

I heerd the shootin said the boy up thar at the cave n I
couldnt stay thar I knowed ye could whoop him Rome n I seed Steve
too but I was afeard Then he saw the body His tongue stopped his
face shrivelled and Steve hanging with one hand to the ledge watched
him curiously

Rome said the boy in a quick whisper is he daid

Come on said Steve roughly Theyll be up hyeh atter us in a
minute Leave Jass gun thar n send that boy back home

That day the troops cameyoung Blue Grass Kentuckians That night
within the circle of their campfires a last defiance was cast in the
teeth of law and order Flames rose within the old courthouse and
before midnight the moonlight fell on four black walls That night too
the news of young Jaspers fate was carried to the deathbed of Romes
mother and before day the old woman passed in peace That day Stetsons
and Lewallens disbanded The Lewallens had no leader the Stetsons
no enemies to fight Some hid some left the mountains some gave
themselves up for trial Upon Rome Stetson the burden fell Against him
the law was set A price was put on his head his house was burneda
last act of Lewallen hateand Rome was homeless the last of his race
and an outlaw




XIII

WITH the start of a few hours and the sympathy of his people one
mountaineer can defy the army of the United States and the mountaineers
usually laugh when they hear troops are coming For the time they stop
fighting and hide in the woods and when the soldiers are gone they
come out again and begin anew their little pleasantries But the
soldiers can protect the judge on his bench and the countyseat in time
of court and for these purposes they serve well

The search for Rome Stetson then was useless His friends would aid
him his enemies feared to betray him So the soldiers marched away one
morning and took their prisoners for safekeeping in the Blue Grass
until court should open at Hazlan

Meantime spring came and deepened the mountain spring The berries of
the wintergreen grew scarce and Rome Stetson hiding out as the
phrase is had to seek them on the northern face of the mountains The
moss on the naked winter trees brightened in color and along the river
where willows drooped ran faint lines of green The trailing arbutus
gave out delicate pink blossoms and the south wind blew apart the
petals of the anemone Soon violets unfolded above the dead leaves
azaleas swung their yellow trumpets through the undergrowth overhead
the dogwood tossed its snowflakes in gusts through the green and gold
of new leaves and sunlight and higher still waved the poplar blooms
with honey ready on every crimson heart for the bees Down in the valley
Rome Stetson could see about every little cabin pink clouds and
white clouds of peach and of apple blossoms Amid the ferns about him
shadeloving trilliums showed their manyhued faces and every opening
was thickly peopled with larkspur seeking the sun The giant magnolia
and the umbrellatree spread their great creamy flowers the laurel
shook out myriads of pink and white bells and the queen of mountain
flowers was stirring from sleep in the buds of the rhododendron

With the spring new forces pulsed the mountain air The spirit of the
times reached even Hazlan A railroad was coming up the river so the
rumor was When winter broke surveyors had appeared after them mining
experts and purchasers of land New ways of breadmaking were open to
all and the feudsman began to see that he could make food and clothes
more easily and with less danger than by sleeping with his rifle in the
woods and by fighting men who had done him no harm Many were tired of
fighting many forced into the feud had fought unwillingly Others had
sold their farms and wild lands and were moving toward the Blue Grass
or westward The desperadoes of each faction had fled the law or were
in its clutches The last Lewallen was dead the last Stetson was hidden
away in the mountains There were left Mareums and Braytons but only
those who felt safest from indictment in these a spirit of hostility
would live for years and roused by passion or by drink would do
murder now on one side of the Cumberland and now on the other but the
StetsonLewallen feud old Gabe believed was at an end at last

All these things the miller told Rome Stetson who well knew what they
meant He was safe enough from the law while the people took no part
in his capture but he grew apprehensive when he learned of the changes
going on in the valley None but old Gabe knew where he was to be sure
but with his own enemies to guide the soldiers he could not hope
to remain hidden long Still with that love of the mountains
characteristic of all races born among them he clung to his own land
He would rather stay where he was the space of a year and die he told
old Gabe passionately than live to old age in another State

But there was another motive and he did not hide it On the other side
he had one enemy leftthe last too of her racewho was more to him
than his own dead kindred who hated him who placed at his door all her
sorrows For her he was living like a wolf in a cave and old Gabe knew
it Her he would not leave

I tell ye Rome youve got to go Thars no use talkin Court comes
the fust Monday in June The soldiers ull be hyeh Hit wont be safe
Thars some that spicions I know whar ye air now n theyll be
spyin n mebbe hitll git me into trouble too aidin n abettin a
man to git away who air boun to the law

The two were sitting on the earthen floor of the cave before a little
fire and Rome with his hands about his knees and his brows knitted
was staring into the yellow blaze His unshorn hair fell to his
shoulders his face was pale from insufficient food and exercise and
tense with a look that was at once caged and defiant

Uncle Gabe he asked quietly for the old mans tone was a little
querulous air ye sorry ye holped me Do ye blame me fer whut Ive
done

No said the old miller answering both questions I dont I believe
whut ye tol me Though even ef ye had a done it I dont know as Id
blame ye seem that it was a far fight I dont doubt he was doin his
best to kill you

Rome turned quickly his face puzzled and darkening

Uncle Gabe whut air you drivin at The old man spat into the fire
and shifted his position uneasily as Romes hand caught his knee

Well ef I have to tell ye I spose I must Thars been nothin
pertickler agin ye so fer cept fer breakin that confederatin
statute bout bandin fightin men together n nobody was very anxious
to git hol o ye jes fer that but nowthe old man stopped a moment
for Romes eyes were kindlingthey say that ye killed Jas Lew allen
n that ye air a murderer n hit air powerful strange how all of
a suddint folks seem to be gittin down on a man as kills his
fellowcreetur n now they means to hunt ye til they ketch ye

It was all out now and the old man was relieved Rome rose to his feet
and in sheer agony of spirit paced the floor

I tol ye Uncle Gabe that I didnt kill him

So ye did n I believe ye But a feller seed you n Steve comm
from the place whar Jas was found dead n whar the dirt n rock was
throwed about as by two bucks in springtime Steve says he didnt
do it n he wouldnt say you didnt Looks to me like Steve did the
killn n was lyin a leetle He haint goin to confess hit to
save your neck n he cant no way fer he hev lit out o these
mountinslong ago

If Steve was out of danger suspicion could not harm him and Rome said
nothing

Isoms got the lingerin fever agin n hes outin his head Hes
ravin bout that fight Looks like ye tol him bout it He says
Dont tell Uncle Gabe n he keeps sayin it Hitll most kill him
ef you go way but he wants ye to git out o the mountins n Rome
youve got to go

Who was it Uncle Gabe that seed me n Steve comm way from thar

He air the same feller who hev been spyin ye all the time this wars
been goin on hits that driedfaced snaky Eli Crump who ye knocked
down n choked up in Hazlan one day fer sayin something agin Isom

I knowed itI knowed itoh ef I could git my fingers roun his throat
once morejes once moreId be mos ready to die

He stretched out his hands as he strode back and forth with his fingers
crooked like talons his shadow leaped from wall to wall and his voice
filling the cave was for the moment scarcely human The old man
waited till the paroxysm was over and Rome had again sunk before the
fire

Hit ud do no good Rome he said rising to go Youve got enough
on ye now without the sin o takin his life You better make up yer
mind to leave the mountins now right way Youre agittin no moren
halfhuman livin up hyeh like a catamount I dont see how ye kin
stand it Thars no hope o things blowin over boy n givin ye a
chance o comm out agin as yer dad and yer grandad usen to do afore
ye The citizens air gittin tired o these wars They keeps out the
furriners who makes roads n buys lands they air agin the law
agin religion agin yo pocket n agin mine Lots o folks hev
been agin all this fightin fer a long time but they was too skeery
to say so They air talkin mighty big now seem they kin git soldiers
hyeh to pertect em So ye mought as well give up the idea o staying
hyeh lessn ye want to give yourself up to the law

The two stepped from the cave and passed through the rhododendrons till
they stood on the cliff overlooking the valley The rich light lay like
a golden mist between the mountains and through it far down the river
moaned like the wind of a coming storm

Did ye tell the gal whut I tol ye

Yes Rome hit wasnt no use She says Steves words as good as yourn
n she knowed about the crosses Folks say she swore awful agin ye
at young Jass burial lowin that shed hunt ye down hersef ef the
soldiers didnt ketch ye I haint seed her sence she got sick pears
like everbodys sick Mebbe shes a leetle settled down nowno tellin
No use foolin with her Rome You git away from hyeh Dont you worry
bout IsomIll take keer o him n when he gits well hell want to
come atter ye n Ill let him go He couldnt live hyeh without you
But yu must git away Rome n git away mighty quick

With hands clasped behind him Rome stood and watched the bent figure
slowly pick its way around the stony cliff

I reckon Ive got to go Shes agin me theyre all agin me I
reckon Ive jes got to go Somehow Ive been kinder hopin He closed
his lips to check the groan that rose to them and turned again into the
gloom behind him




XIV

JUNE came The wild rose swayed above its image along every little
shadowed stream and the scent of wild grapes was sweet in the air and
as vagrant as a bluebirds note in autumn The rhododendrons burst into
beauty making gray ridge and gray cliff blossom with purple hedging
streams with snowy clusters and shining leaves and lighting up
dark coverts in the woods as with white stars The leaves were full
woodthrushes sang and bees droned like unseen running water in the
woods

With June came circuit court once moreand the soldiers Faint music
pierced the dreamy chant of the river one morning as Rome lay on a
bowlder in the summer sun and he watched the guns flashing like another
stream along the water and then looked again to the Lewallen cabin
Never morning noon or night when he came from the rhododendrons or
when they closed about him did he fail to turn his eyes that way Often
he would see a bright speck moving about the dim lines of the cabin
and he would scarcely breathe while he watched it so easily would it
disappear Always he had thought it was Martha and now he knew it was
for the old miller had told him more of the girl and had wrung his
heart with pity She had been ill a long while The furriners had
seized old Jaspers cabin and land The girl was homeless and she did
not know it for no one had the heart to tell her She was living
with the Braytons and every day she went to the cabin mooninn
sorrowin aroun as old Gabe said and she was much changed

Once more the miller camefor the last time he said firmly Crump had
trailed him and had learned where Rome was The search would begin next
dayperhaps that very nightand Crump would guide the soldiers Now he
must go and go quickly The boy too sent word that unless Rome went
he would have something to tell Old Gabe saw no significance in the
message but he had promised to deliver it and he did Rome wavered
then Steve and himself gone no suspicion would fall on the lad If he
were caught the boy might confess With silence Rome gave assent and
the two parted in an apathy that was like heartlessness Only old Gabes
shrunken breast heaved with something more than weariness of descent
and Rome stood watching him a long time before he turned back to the
cave that had sheltered him from his enemies among beasts and men In
a moment he came out for the last time and turned the opposite way
Climbing about the spur he made for the path that led down to the
river When he reached it he glanced at the sun and stopped in
indecision Straight above him was a knoll massed with rhododendrons
the flashing leaves of which made it like a great seawave in the
slanting sun while the blooms broke slowly down over it like foam
Above this was a gray sepulchre of dead standing trees more gaunt and
spectrelike than ever with the rich life of summer about it Higher
still were a dark belt of stunted firs and the sandstone ledge and
above thesehome He was risking his liberty his life Any clump of
bushes might bristle suddenly with Winchesters If the soldiers sought
for him at the cave they would at the same time guard the mountain
paths they would guard too the Stetson cabin But no matterthe sun
was still high and he turned up the steep The ledge passed he stopped
with a curse at his lips and the pain of a knifethrust at his heart
A heap of blackened stones and ashes was before him The wild
mountaingrass was growing up about it The beegums were overturned and
rifled The garden was a tangled mass of weeds The graves in the little
family buryingground were unprotected the fence was gone and no
boards marked the last two ragged mounds Old Gabe had never told him
He too like Martha was homeless and the old miller had been kind to
him as the girls kinspeople had been to her

For a long while he sat on the remnant of the burned and broken fence
and once more the old tide of bitterness rose within him and ebbed away
There were none left to hate to wreak vengeance on It was hard to
leave the ruins as they were and yet he would rather leave weeds and
ashes than like Martha have some day to know that his home was in the
hands of a stranger When he thought of the girl he grew calmer his own
sorrows gave way to the thought of hers and half from habit he raised
his face to look across the river Two eagles swept from a dark ravine
under the shelf of rock where he had fought young Jasper and made for
a sunlighted peak on the other shore From them his gaze fell to Wolfs
Head and to the cabin beneath and a name passed his lips in a whisper

Then he took the path to the river and he found the canoe where old
Gabe had hidden it Before the young moon rose he pushed into the stream
and drifted with the current At the mouth of the creek that ran over
old Gabes waterwheel he turned the prow to the Lewallen shore

Not yit Not yit he said




XV

THAT night Rome passed in the woods with his rifle in a bed of
leaves Before daybreak he had built a fire in a deep ravine to cook his
breakfast and had scattered the embers that the smoke should give no
sign The sun was high when he crept cautiously in sight of the Lewallen
cabin It was much like his own home on the other shore except that the
house closed and desolate was standing and the bees were busy At the
corner of the kitchen a rusty axe was sticking in a halfcut piece of
timber and on the porch was a heap of kindling and fire woodthe last
work old Jasper and his son had ever done In the Lewallens garden
also two graves were fresh and the spirit of neglect and ruin overhung
the place

All the morning he waited in the edge of the laurel peering down the
path watching the clouds race with their shadows over the mountains or
pacing to and fro in his covert of leaves and flowers He began to fear
at last that she was not coming that she was ill and once he started
down the mountain toward Steve Braytons cabin The swift descent
brought him to his senses and he stopped halfway and climbed back
again to his hidingplace What he was doing what he meant to do he
hardly knew Midday passed the sun fell toward the mountains and once
more came the fierce impulse to see her even though he must stalk into
the Brayton cabin Again halfcrazed he started impetuously through
the brush and shrank back and stood quiet A little noise down the
path had reached his ear In a moment he could hear slow footfalls and
the figure of the girl parted the pinkandwhite laurel blossoms which
fell in a shower about her when she brushed through them She passed
quite near him walking slowly and stopped for a moment to rest against
a pillar of the porch She was very pale her face was traced deep with
suffering and she was as old Gabe said much changed Then she went
on toward the garden stepping with an effort over the low fence and
leaned as if weak and tired against the appletree the boughs of which
shaded the two graves at her feet For a few moments she stood there
listless and Rome watched her with hungry eyes at a loss what to do
She moved presently and walked quite around the graves without looking
at them then came back past him and seating herself in the porch
turned her face to the river The sun lighted her hair and in the
sunken upturned eyes Rome saw the shimmer of tears

Marthy He couldnt help itthe thick low cry broke like a groan
from his lips and the girl was on her feet facing him She did not
know the voice nor the shaggy halfwild figure in the shade of the
laurel and she started back as if to run but seeing that the man did
not mean to harm her she stopped looking for a moment with wonder and
even with quick pity at the hunted face with its white appeal Then a
sudden spasm caught her throat and left her body rigid her hands shut
and her eyes dry and hardshe knew him A slow pallor drove the flush of
surprise from her face and her lips moved once but there was not even
a whisper from them Rome raised one hand before his face as though to
ward off something Dont look at me that way Marthymy God dont I
didnt kill him I swar it I give him a chance fer his life I know
I knowSteve says he didnt Thar was only us two Hit looks agin
me but I haint killed one nur tother I let em both go Yu dont
believe me He went swiftly toward her his gun outstretched Hyeh
gal I heerd ye swore ag in me out thar in the gyardenlowin that
you was goin to hunt me down yerself if the soldiers didnt Hyehs yer
chance

The girl shrank away from him too startled to take the weapon and he
leaned it against her and stood away with his hands behind him

Kill me ef ye think Im alyin to ye he said Yu kin git even with
me now But I want to tell ye fustthe girl had caught the muzzle of
the gun convulsively and was bending over it her eyes burning her
face inscrutablehit was a far fight betwixt us n I whooped him He
got his gun then n would a killed me agin his oath ef he hadnt
been shot fust Hits so too bout the crosses I made em theyre
right thar on that gun but whut could I do with mam astandin right
thar with the gun n Uncle Rufe atellin bout my own dad layin in
his blood n Isom n the boys lookin on But I went agin my oath
I gave him his life when I had the right to take it I could a killed
yer dad once n I had the right to kill him too fer killin mine
but I let him go n I reckon I done that fer ye too Pears like I
haint done nothin sence I seed ye over thar in the mill that day that
wasnt done fer ye Somehow ye put me dead agin my own kin n tuk
away all my hate agin yourn I couldnt fight fer thinkin I was
fightin you n when I seed ye comm through the bushes jes now so
white n sicklylike I couldnt hardly git breath athinkin I was
the cause of all yer misery Thats all He stretched out his arms
Shoot gal ef ye dont believe me Id jes as lieve die ef ye thinks
Im lyin to ye n ef ye hates me fer whut I haint done

The gun had fallen to the earth The girl trembling at the knees sank
to her seat on the porch and folding her arms against the pillar
pressed her forehead against them her face unseen Rome stooped to pick
up the weapon

Im goin way now he went on slowly after a little pause but I
couldnt leave hyeh without seem you I wanted ye to know the truth
n I lowed yud believe me ef I tol ye myself Ive been awaitin
thar in the lorrel fer ye sence mornin Uncle Gabe tol me ye come hyeh
ever day He says Ive got to go Ive been hopin I mought come out o
the bushes some day But Uncle Gabe says everbodys agin me more n
ever n that the soldiers mean to ketch me The govner out thar in
the settlements says as how hell give five hundred dollars fer me
livin or dead Hell nuver git me livinIve swore thatn as I hev
done nothin sech as folks on both sides hev done who air walkin
roun free I haint goin to give up Hits purty hard to leave these
mountins Reckon Ill nuver see em agin Been livin like a catamount
over thar on the knob I could jes see you over hyeh n I reckon
I haint done much cept lay over thar on a rock n watch ye movin
round Hits mighty good to feel that ye believe me n I want ye to
know that I been stayin over thar fer nothin on earth but jes to see
you agin n I want ye to know that I was asorrowin fer ye when
yu was sick n apinin to see ye n ahopin some day yu
mought kinder git over yer hate fer me He had been talking with low
tenderness half to himself and with his face to the river and he did
not see the girls tears falling to the porch Her sorrow gave way in
a great sob now and he turned with sharp remorse and stood quite near
her

Dont cry Marthy he said God knows hits hard to think Ive
brought all this on ye when Id give all these mountins to save ye
from it Whut d ye say Dont cry

The girl was trying to speak at last and Rome bent over to catch the
words

I haint cryin fer myself she said faintly and then she said no
more but the first smile that had passed over Romes face for many a
day passed then and he put out one big hand and let it rest on the
heap of lustrous hair

Marthy I hate to go way leavin ye hyeh with nobody to take keer o
ye Youre all alone hyeh in the mountins Im all alone n I reckon
Ill be all alone wharever I go ef you stay hyeh I got a boat down
thar on the river n Im goin out West whar Uncle Rufe use to live I
know I haint good fer nothin muchhe spoke almost huskily he could
scarcely get the words to his lipsbut I want ye to go with me Wont
ye

The girl did not answer but her sobbing ceased slowly while Rome
stroked her hair and at last she lifted her face and for a moment
looked to the other shore Then she rose There is a strange pride in
the Kentucky mountaineer

As you say Rome thars nobody left but you n nobody but me but
they burned you out we haint evenyit Her eyes were on Thunderstruck
Knob where the last sunlight used to touch the Stetson cabin

Hyeh Rome He knew what she meant and he kneeled at the pile of
kindlingwood near the kitchen door Then they stood back and waited
The sun dipped below a gap in the mountains the sky darkened and the
flames rose to the shingled porch and leaped into the gathering dusk
On the outer edge of the quivering light where it touched the blossomed
laurel the two stood till the blaze caught the eaves of the cabin and
then they turned their faces where burning to ashes in the west was
another fire whose light blended in the eyes of each with a light older
and more lasting than its ownthe light eternal
