CHAPTER I IN WHICH HE VOWS A VOW


There comes the Green Imp

How can you tell

Dont you hear Reds coming in on five cylinders for all he can get
out of em Anybody else would stop and fix up Hes in too much of a
hurryas usual

The Green Imp tore past the porch where Burnss neighbours waved arms of
greeting which he failed to see for he did not turn his head The car
went round the curve of the driveway at perilous speed and only the
fact that from road to old red barn was a good twenty rods made it
seem possible that the Green Imp could come to a standstill in time to
prevent its banging into the rear wall of the barn

Two minutes later Burns ran by the Chesters porch on his way to his
own Chester hailed him

Whats your everlasting hurry Red Come up and sit down and cool off

Not now called back a voice curtly out of the June twilight The big
figure ran on and disappeared into the small house the door slamming
shut behind it

Reds in a temper Tell by the sound of his voice

Is he ever in anything except a temper inquired a guest of the
Chesters Arthur Chester turned on her

Shows you dont know him much Pauline Hes the owner of the fiercest
good disposition ever heard of Hes the pepperest proposition of an
angel this earth has ever seen Hes a redheaded sharptongued brute
of a saint

Why Arthur Chester

Hes a pot of mustard thats clear balmif you dont mind getting
stung when its applied

Well of all the

Im going over to get something for this abominable headacheand
incidentally to find out whats the row Hes probably lost a
patientit always goes to his brain like that When he abuses his
beloved engine that way its because some other machinery has stopped
somewhere

If hes lost a patient youd better let him alone dear advised his
wife Winifred

Nohe needs to get his mind off it on me I can fix up a few symptoms
for him

Hell see through you called Mrs Chester softly after him

No doubt of that But it may divert him just the same

Chester made his way across the lawn and in at the side door which led
to the dimly lighted village offices of Redfield Pepper Burns physician
and surgeon Not that the giltlettered sign on the glass of the office
door read that way R P Burns MD was the brief inscription above
the table of office hours and the owner of the name invariably so
curtailed it But among his friends the full name had inevitably been
turned into the nickname for the big redhaired quicktempered
warmhearted fellow was Red Pepper Burns as irresistibly to them as he
had been a decade earlier to his classmates in college

As Chester went in at the door a figure arose slowly from its
positionflung full length face downward on a couch in the shadowy
inner office and came into view

Toothache Dentist down the street said a blurred voice
unsympathetically

Chester laughed Oh come Red said he Give me some of that
headache dope Im all out

Glad to hear it You dont get any more from me

Why not Ive got a sureenough headacheI didnt come over to quiz
you The blamed thing whizzes like a buzz saw

Cant help it Go soak it

Chester advanced Ill get the powders myself then I know the
bottle

A substantial barrier interposed No you dont Youve taken up six
ounces of that stuff do seven days You quit tonight

Look here Red whats the use of taking it out on me like that if you
are mad at something If your head

I wish it did achelike ten thousand furies It might take some of the
pressure off somewhere else growled R P Burns He shut the door of
the inner office hard behind him

I thought so declared Arthur Chester suddenly forgetting about his
headache in his anxiety to know the explanation of the five cylinders
It was a small suburban town in which they lived and if something had
gone wrong it was a matter of common interest Can you tell me about
it he askeda little diffidently for none knew better than he that
things could not always be told and that no lips were locked tighter
than Red Peppers when the secret was not his to tell

Engines on the blink Got to go out and fix it was the unpromising
reply Burns picked up a sparkplug from the office desk as he spoke

Had your dinner

Dont want it

Shall I go out with you

The answer was an unintelligible grunt As Chester was about to follow
his friend outfor there could be no doubt that Red Pepper Burns was
his friend in spite of this somewhat surly though by no means unusual
treatmentanother door opened tentatively and a head was cautiously
inserted

Your dinners ready Doctor Burns said a doubtful voice

Burns turned Leave a pitcher of milk on the table for me Cynthia
he said in a gentler voice than Chester had yet heard from him tonight
crisp though it was Nothing else

Chester catching a glimpse of a brightly lighted diningroom and
a table lavishly spread undertook to remonstrate He had seen the
housekeepers disappointed face also But Burns cut him short

Come alongif you must said he and stalked out into the night

For an hour in the light from one of the Green Imps lamps Chester sat
on an overturned box and watched Burns work He worked savagely as if
applying surgical measures to a mood as well as to a machine He worked
like a skilled mechanic as well every turn of a nut every polish of
a thread meaning definite means to an end The night was hot and he had
thrown off coat and collar and rolled his sleeves high so a brawny arm
gleamed in the bright lamplight and the open shirt exposed a powerful
neck Chester who was of slighter build and not as tall as he would
have liked to be watched enviously

Whatever goes wrong with your affairs Red he observed suddenly
breaking a long interval during which the engine had been made to throb
and whirl like the ten thousand furies to whom its engineer had lately
made allusion you have the tremendous asset of a magnificent body to
fall back on for comfort

With a movement of the hand Burns stopped his engine now running
quietly and stood up straight He threw out one bare arm grimy
and oily with his labours Two hours ago said he in a voice now
controlled and solemn if by cutting off that right arm at the shoulder
I could have saved a human life Id have done it

And now retorted Chester quickly now two hours afterwould you
cut it off now

Red Pepper looked at him The arm dropped No said he I wouldnt
Not for a dozen lives like that Im not heroic after allonly hot and
cold by jumps like a thermometer But I ache all over just the same
She runs like a bird now Jump inwell take a spin and try her out on
the road I may need her before midnight

Nothing loth for he knew the Green Imp and her driver and had had many
a swift run on a moonlight night before in the same company Chester
took the slim roadsters other seat watching the long green hood point
the way down the driveway past the porch where the women in white
gowns showing coolly in the light from the arc lamp at the corner of the
street called a goodbye

Backsome time replied Chesters voice rising above the low purr
of the engine with a note of satisfaction in it The figure beside him
still in open white shirt with bare arms and uncovered thick thatch
of red hair did not turn its head

Arthurs never so happy as when hes out with Red in the Green Imp
Winifred said to her guest as the roadster shot away under the elms
which drooped beneath the arc light

Doctor Burns is certainly the oddest man I ever saw replied the
guest swinging idly in the hammock and watching the car out of sight
down the long vista of the village street He hasnt given me one real
good look yet I suppose if I were a patient he would favour me with an
allseeing gaze out of those IrishScotch barbarian eyes of his but as
it isher voice was slightly petulantI believe I shall have to do
as Arthur has make up some symptoms and go over to his office

If you do youll get precisely the same treatment I presume Arthur
had Mrs Chester laughed as she spoke I doubt very much whether he
comes back with any headache medicine

But he got a moonlight ride in that beauty of a car the guest
declared enviously That treatment would suit me wonderfully well
whatever was the matter

Would you have gone with him in his shirtsleeves Hes plainly in a
shirtsleeve mood tonight

I think a drive in the moonlight with a brute of a saint in
shirtsleeves with arms like those might be interesting mused the
guest indicating invisible patterns on the porch with the toe of a
white slipper

He would probably talk cars and engines every mile in the most
matteroffact way Winifred Chester assured her No woman yet has
ever been able as far as this town knows to strike a spark of romance
out of Red Pepper Burns

Yet he has red hair murmured the guest to herself and continued to
look thoughtfully down the street along which the Green Imp had shot out
toward the open country beyond

Out in that open country miles away the car running with that
exquisite precision of rotating cylinder explosions which is music to
the trained ear of the mechanic at the wheel the two men sat silent
The pace of the Green Imp was one to cut off speech for the road wets
straight and empty stretching like a white ribbon under the stars
with now and then a band of midnight shade crossing it where arching
treetops met the course which invites an open throttle and the intent
eye which goes with it

Suddenly the car struck aside from the straightaway and with open
cutout roared up a steep hill by means of which a narrow road led
off toward a part of the country not often selected by motorists for
pleasure spins Chester recognized that his companion had a purpose
beyond that of trying out his engine unless indeed the tough and
rocky grade were a test But Burns was still silent and the other man
applied himself to holding on A mile up the road the car came to an
abrupt standstill before a tiny house

Going to make a call after all was on Chesters lips but the sight
of something showing white beside the door in the lamplight which
streamed out upon a small decrepit porch drove back the words

Burns left a silent engine and strode up the straggling path with the
light tread of the heavy man whose muscles are under his control He
walked in at the open door without knocking and Chester caught the
sharp sound of a womans voice at a tension saying Oh Doctor

It seemed to him an hour though by his watch it was but nine minutes
that he sat watching the little flimsy streamer of white flutter to and
fro in the lamplight his heart beating heavily as a fathers will at
sight of the sign of some other mans loss

At the end of those interminable nine minutes Burns was back again in
the car He turned the Green Imp about as quietly as if she were a
cat stealing out of the yard and sent her down the rocky road at her
slowest speed At the bottom of the hill he broke the long silence

Couldnt have slept an hour if I hadnt come back he said in a low
tone Back and apologized for being a brute Its eased me up a bit I
think its eased her too poor soul

Then it wasnt losing the case Chester began doubtfully He was never
sure just when it was safe to ask Red Pepper questions but he thought
it seemed safer than usual now

No it wasnt losing the case though that was bad enough It was
losing my infernal hairtrigger of a temper thats been cutting in like
a knife I had the boy where he ought to get well if they followed my
precautions a thousand times repeated This morning his heart was a
whole lot stronger it only needed time Tonight his mother let him sit
upin spite of all Id threatened her with if she did He went out like
a snuffed candle When I saw it I was so angry with her Ihe thrust
up one hand and ran it through his thick locks with a gesture of
savageryI let loose on herpoor soul with her heart already broken
He was the only boyof courseI ought to have been shot on the spot

He sent the car flying down the road Chester could think of nothing
to say He could imagine the sort of apology Red had given the boys
motherone to make her forgive and adore him No doubt it had eased
her It must have been a hard thing for R P Burns MD to do
Suddenly recalling this he said so and added a word of admiration
Burns turned on him

Boy he said Im the toughest case on my list Im a chronic
patient Just as I think I have myself in hand I suffer a relapse
I break out in a new place Of all men who need selfcontrol its
a surgeon needs it most Sometimes Im in too much of a temper to
operatejust because a nurse has failed to provide the right sutures
Every red hair on my head stands up like a porcupines quillsmy
hand isnt steady I cant trust my own judgment till Ive cooled down
Theres only one hope for me

He broke off abruptly and the Green Imp accelerated her pace as they
came to the long straight road home Until they reached the turn under
the elms which led to the town he left the sentence unfinished while
Chester waited Chester felt it would be worth waiting forthat which
Red Pepper might say next When it came it surprised himit even gave
him a strange thrill coming from Red Pepper

Ive put my case into the only competent hands said Burns slowly and
quite simply Ive promised my Maker Ill never insult His name again




CHAPTER II IN WHICH HE CREATES A CIRCUS


Doctor Burns

Yes Miss Mathewson

The longdistance telephone please

Burns excused himself to the last patient of the evening series and
shut himself in with the longdistance When he came out he was looking
at his watch From its face he turned to that of his office nursethe
one hardly less businesslike in expression than the other

Miss Mathewson my aunt telephones that my father and mother are both
sick each anxious to distraction about the other she about them both
and under the weather herself If you and I can catch the tenfifteen
tonight we can be there by two and by leaving there at four we can be
back here in time for the mornings operations If they need you Ill
leave you there for a day or twoby your leave Well take the Green
Imp into the citythe tenfifteen doesnt stop here Then itll be at
the hospital when we want it in the morning Youve twenty minutes to
get ready

Very well Doctor Burns

The office bell rang Burns fled toward the inner office Miss Mathewson
discovered the guest of the Chesters on the doorstepall in white with
a face which usually stimulated interest wherever it was seen

May I see Doctor Burns just a minutefor Mr Chester The caller
took her cue cleverly from Miss Mathewsons face which at the moment
expressed schedules and engagements thick as blackberries in August
Burns just closing the inner door caught Chesters name He pulled
off his white office coat slid into his gray tweed one and opened the
door

What can I do for Mr Chesterin three minutes he inquired coming
forward Miss Mathewson aware of the shortness of time vanished

Give me something for his headache please replied the young person
in white promptly Schedules and engagements were in R P Burnss eyes
also they looked at her without appearing to see her at all To this
she was not accustomed and it displeased her

Was it too severe for him to come himself

Much too severe He has gone to bed with it

Mrs Chester closely attending him

Certainlyor I shouldnt be here The eyes of the Chesters guest
sparkled Something about the cool tone of this question displeased her
still more

Tell him to get up and go out and walk a mile breathing deep all the
way

No medicine

Not a grain He ought to know better than to ask

He does I think He suggested that possibly if I askedBut I see for
myself how that wouldnt make the slightest difference

Im glad your perceptions are so acute replied Burns gravely

Are the three minutes up asked the caller

He looked at his watch I think not quite Is there anything of
importance to fill the one remaining

Nothing whateverexcept to mention your fee The guest receded
gracefully from the door

If the patient will follow directions Ill ask no fee If he doesnt
Ill exact one when I see him again Forgive my haste MissHalstead

Hempstead corrected the caller crisply Dont mention it
DoctorBrown Good night

The Chesters guest lingered on the porch before going in to report the
failure of her mission She was still lingering there when the
Green Imp carrying no openshirted mechanic but a properly clothed
professional gentleman and a severely dressed professional lady whirled
away down the drive

He really was going somewhere in a hurry then admitted the guest
In which case I cant be quite so offended I wonder if that nurse
enjoys her trips with himwhen his mouth doesnt happen to be shut like
a steel trap

If she could have seen the pair on the train which presently bore them
flying away across the state she would hardly have envied either of
them Between abstraction on the one side and reserve an the other they
exchanged less conversation than two strangers might have done When
Miss Mathewsons eyes drooped with weariness her companion made her as
comfortable as he could and bade her rest His own eyes were untouched
by slumber he stared straight before him or out into the night seeing
nothing but a white farmhouse far ahead where his anxious thoughts were
waiting for his body to catch up

Are they much sick Zeke

Wal I dunno hardly RedYou goin to drive Theyre pretty lively
them blacks Aint used to comin to the station at two oclock in the
mornin Your mas been worryin about your pa for a considable spell
and now that shes took down so severe herself hes gone to pieces some
Miss Ellenll be glad to see you

The blacks covered the mile from the station as they had never covered
it before and Burns was in the house five minutes before they had
expected him

Mother heres your big boyDad here I amheres Red Bless your
heartsyou wanted me didnt you

They could hardly tell him how they had wanted him but he saw it in
their faces

Ive got to take the four oclock backworse luckfor some
operations I cant postpone But between now and then Im going to look
you over and set you straight and Ill be back again in two days if you
need me Now for it Mother first Come here Aunt Ellen and tell me
all about her

R P Burns MD had never been quicker nor more thorough at
examination of a pair of patients than with these He went straight at
them both each in the presence of the other Miss Mathewson capably
assisting With his most professional air he asked his questions
applied his trained senses to the searching tests made of special
organs and gave directions for future treatment Then he sat back and
looked at them

Do I appear worried about her Dad

Why you dont seem to Red

Miss Mathewson should you gather from my appearance that I am consumed
with anxiety

I think you seem very much relieved Doctor Burns

Mother as you look at Dad over on the couch there does he strike you
as appearing like a frightfully sick man

Mrs Burns smiled faintly in the direction of the couch but her eyes
came immediately back to her sons He seems a good deal better since
you came Redfield

Theres not a thing the matter with either of you except what can be
fixed up in a week Youve got scared to death about each other and
thats pulled you both down What you need more than anything else is to
go to a circusand by GeorgeSince I didnt observe any tents in the
darkness as we drove along you shall have one come to you Look here
Did you know Id kept up my old athletic stunts these nine years since I
left college

He pulled off his coat waistcoat collar shoes rolled his
shirtsleeves as high as they would go and turned a series of
handsprings across the wide room Then he stood on his head he balanced
chairs on his chin he seized his fathers hickory stick and went
through a set of military evolutions Then he put on his shoes eyeing
his patients with satisfaction His mother had lifted her head to watch
him and Miss Mathewson had tucked an extra pillow under it His father
had drawn himself up to a halfsitting posture and was regarding his son
with pride

I never thought so well of those doings before he was saying If
theyve kept you as supple as a willow in spite of your weight I
should say youd better keep em up

You bet I willSee here Aunt Ellenyou used to play the Irish
Washerwoman Mind playing it now Miss Mathewson and I are going to do a
cakewalk

He glanced laughing at his office nurse She was staring at him
wideeyed He threw back his head showing a splendid array of white
teeth as he roared at her expression

Forget Doctor Burns please said he in answer to the expression
Hes discharged this case as not serious enough for him and left it
to Red Pepper to administer a few gentle stimulants on the quack order
Come You can do a cake walk Forget youre a graduate of any training
school but the vaudeville show

He caught her hand Flushing so that her plain face became almost
pretty she yieldedfor the hand was insistent Miss Ellen leaned
bewildered against the door which led to the sittingroom where the old
piano stood Her nephew looked at her again with the eyes which
the Chesters guest had somewhat incoherently described as
IrishScotchbarbarian He said Please Aunt Ellen theres a good
fellow at which Mr Burns Senior chuckled under his breath for
anything less like that of a good fellow was never seen than Sister
Ellens prim little personality Miss Ellen went protestingly to the
piano Was it right her manner said to be performing in this idiotic
manner at this unholy hour of three oclock in the morningin a
sickroom

It mattered little whether Miss Mathewson could or could not dance the
Irish Washerwoman or any other antic dance improvised to that live
air she had only to yield herself to Red Pepper Burnss hands and
steps and let him disport himself around her A most startlingly
hilarious performance was immediately and effectively produced At the
height of it a door across the sittingroom which commanded a strip
of the bedroom beyond opened cautiously and Zeke Crandalls eye glued
itself to the aperture an eye astonished beyond belief

If that there Red aint acuttin up jest exactly as he used to when
he was a boyand his pa and ma sick abed If twas anybody but Red Id
say he was crazy

Then he caught the sound of a laugh from lips he had not heard laugh
like that for a yeara chuckling delighted laugh only slightly
asthmatic and wholly unrestrained He began to laugh himself

If folks round here could see Red Burns now theyd never believe the
stories about his gettin to be such a darned successful man at his
business he reflected Of all the goins on Look at him now An
that nurse An Miss Ellen aplayin for em Oh my eye

Songs followedcollege songs popular airs opera bitsall delivered
in a resounding barytone and accompanied by thumping chords improvised
by the performer Out through the open windows they floated and one
astonished villages driving by to take the early train caught the
exultant strains

 Oh see dat watermillion asmilin fro de fence
 How I wish dat watermillion it was mine
 Oh de white folks must be foolish
 Dey need a heap of sense
 Or dyed nebber leave it dar upon de vine
 Oh de hambone am sweet
 An de bacon am good
 An de possum fat am berry berry fine
 But gib me yes gib me
 Oh how I wish you would
 Dat watermillion growin on de vine

Before they knew it the early morning light was creeping in at the
smallpaned windows Burns consulted his watch

If youll give us a cup of coffee Aunt Ellen well be off in fifteen
minutes Miss Mathewsonhis glance mirthfully surveyed herAunt Ellen
will take you upstairs and give you a chance to put that magnificent
brown hair into a condition where it will not shock the natives at the
station As for mine

When Aunt Ellen and Miss Mathewson each in her own way feeling as if
she had passed through an extraordinary experience likely never to
occur again had hurried away Burns applied himself to a process of
reconstruction When every rebellious red hair had been reduced to its
usual order and his thick locks lay with the little wave in them as his
mother had begun to brush them years ago when collar and cravat rose
sedately above the gray tweed coat and a fresh fine handkerchief had
replaced the dingy one which had been through every manner of exercise
in the circus Burns drew up a chair and faced his patients with the
keen professional gaze which told him whether or not his nights work
had been good therapeutics

When Ive gone youre to have breakfast and I think youll both
eat it he said smiling at them his eyes bright with affection and
contentment Then youre to compose yourselves for sleep and I think
youll both sleep Tomorrow Dads to be out on the porchall June
is out there and the roses are in full bloom Day after tomorrow
Motherll be there too in the hammock As soon as these cases I
operate on this morning are out of danger Ill be down again for a whole
day Ill keep the time clear

Im afraid said his father looking suddenly anxious for a new cause
your being up all night wont make your hand any steadier for those
operations Red

On the contrary as a matter of fact Dad itll be a lot steadier just
because of my being up all night assuring myself that theres nothing
serious the matter with you and Mother except the need of a bit of
jollying by your boywhich youve certainly had right off the reel eh
Aunt Ellen thinks yet Ive probably killed you Are you the worse for
it Mother Give it to me straight now

He bent over her his fingers on her delicate wrist She smiled up into
his eyes Redfield she murmured As if I could ever be the worse for
having you come home

He dropped on his knees beside the bed looking at her with the eyes of
the boy she had borne Bless me Mother he said unsteadily all the
fun gone out of his face Ineed itto keep decent

The last three words were under his breath but she heard the others and
laid her hand on the red head with a tremulous soft word or two which
lie could barely catch

In a minute he had risen his cheek flushed high and was gripping
his fathers hand You too Dad he begged Im only Red this
morninggoing back into the world

His fathers hand and voice shook as he administered the little
ceremony used only once before in his sons lifewhen at fourteen he
first went away to school Few grown men would have asked for it again
he felt that Coming from Red he was sure the request meant more than
they could know

Then the professional gentleman whom the world knewthe world which was
not acquainted with Red Pepper Burnsand the professional lady who was
his assistant went decorously away into the early June morning Zeke was
grinning to himself as he saw them step aboard the train

Looks mighty fine in them clipperbuilt city clothes Red does he
reflected If that there young woman chose to give him away now but I
kind of guess she wontunder the circumstances




CHAPTER III IN WHICH HE ASSUMES A RESPONSIBILITY


Red the new car is here Come and look her over

It was Burnss neighbour on the other side James Macauley Junior R
P Burns laid down his saw with which in the late June twilight he had
been doing vigorous work at a small woodpile behind the house He stood
up straight throwing back his shoulders to take the kink out of them

All right said he I think Im fit for general society again I
wasnt when I tackled this job Nothing like fifteen minutes of woodpile
for taking the temper out of the sawand the man

Macauley a stout goodhumoured fellow of thirtyfive laughed That
temper of yours Red has it been on the rampage again

It has Dont talk about it or itll lift to confounded red head
againits only scotched for the present New cars here eh

Yes and the pretty widows here toomy wifes sister Ellen Lessing
Weve a great plan for tomorrow Red I cant venture to drive this
elephant of a car yet but the women are wild for a trip in her She
holds seven Martha wants you to drive us and the Chesters tomorrow a
hundred and fifty miles seventyfive to F and back Will you do
it Youre not so horribly busy just now and Mrs Lessing and Pauline
Hempstead together ought to make it worth while for you

This feature of the invitation did not appear to appeal to Burns but
the sight of the touring car brave and shining in russet and brass
plainly did

Not that Id care to drive such a whale for myself but I shouldnt
mind a run for the fun of trying her out You say shes been driven
enough to warm up her engines Suppose we take her out and let me get
the feel of her mouth before tomorrow

Come on And they were off

For a whale shes a bird was Burnss paradoxical verdict two hours
later The trying out had merged into a smooth run of fortyfive miles
at not anything like the full pace of which the motor was capable Best
not to overheat her at first Run your first three hundred miles with
consideration for her vital organsshell have her wind by that time

Next morning four women longcoated tissueveiled watched the brown
beauty roll invitingly up to Macauleys porch steps

As she crossed the lawn with Winifred Pauline Hempstead the guest
of the Chesters was studying not only the car but the undeniably
attractive grayclad figure of the latelyarrived younger sister of Mrs
Macauley Will Red P look at her any more than he does at me she
murmured in Winifred Chesters ear

I doubt it my dear But hell be foolish if he doesnt wont he

I dont care for widows myself

I presume not Winifred laughed comprehendingly

How old is she

Twentyeight I believethough she doesnt look it

Doesnt look it She looks a lot more

Winifred laughed still quietly Although Pauline undoubtedly had
the advantage of Ellen in years her fairhaired blueeyed somewhat
sumptuous beauty was not of so youthful a type as the darker colouring
and slenderer outlines of Marthas sister

The man at the wheel of the brown car lifted his leather cap as the
women came out but he left all the bestowal of them to the other
men Miss Hempstead asked to be allowed to sit beside the driver but
Macauley vowed that on the first long run of his new machine he himself
should occupy that post of honour and interest

Coming back then insisted the girl and Macauley agreed reluctantly
Burns made no comment but applied himself to his tasknot only
then but also for every minute of the seventyfive miles to their
destination

He might as well be a hired chauffeur complained Miss Hempstead when
during a stop of ten minutes on account of a switching freight train
she had leaned forward and attempted in vain to carry on a conversation
with Burns That abstracted mood of hisis there any breaking into
it

Fall out and break your collarbone Hell be all attention advised
Chester

Thank you Im almost tempted to Why dont you drive awhile Mr
Macauley and give him a rest

And let him sit here in the middle with you He couldnt be pried loose
from that wheel now Besides I havent driven this car yet and shes
too different in her steering from my old one I shouldnt like to try
with this crowd behind me

They reached the distant city drew up at the steps of the most
attractive hotel went in to lunch That is to say all did this except
R P Burns He remained in the garage in the rear where he had taken
the car busying himself with some details of mechanism whose working
did not quite suit him In spite of summons and appeals he continued to
work until the rest had finished then he bolted in to wash off dust
and engine grease ate his lunch in ten minutesMacauley sitting by and
expostulatingand bolted out again

Were going to walk about a bit Chester announced invading the
garage The girls insist that you come Where are your eyes man If
Pauline bores youI admit that shes a trifle persistent but shes
jolly good company I thinktry Mrs Lessing Shes delightful and not
the pursuing style at allshes learned better She hasnt shown the
slightest interest in you all morning That ought to attract you

Im going to try a bit of adjustment on this timer now that Macs
out of the way Go along and dont bother me Burns was in his
shirtsleeves again and spoke gruffly His cap was off and thick locks
lay damply against his moist brow in his eyes sparkled enthusiasm but
not for women

You certainly are a hopeless case and Chester went back to his party

We might as well not have a bachelor along mourned Pauline Four
womenwith only two old married men to look after themits a shame

But were both of us much handsomer than Red Pepper Burns asserted
James Macauley Junior And Ive hardly spoken a word to my wife since
I startedthat sort of thing ought to content you

It doesnt And neither of you is half as goodlooking as Doctor Burns
He has the most interesting profile I ever sawand I ought to knowI
seldom catch sight of his full face

I shouldnt suppose an interesting profile whatever that is would
offset a shock of firered hair Now both Chesters hair and mine

His hair isnt firered Its arather strongauburn

Macauley shouted and the rest laughed with him

Rather strong I should say it was Ive been worried about having
him sit near the gasoline tank it brings his hair so close to a high
combustible But it has one advantage if we dont get home before dark
we shant need to light up Reds torch of a head will do the trick we
can come in by the refulgence from that

I shall be sitting in its light going back anyhow Miss Hempstead
exulted

Much good it will do you prophesied Chester

It did Pauline so much good as that she was able to obtain many looks
at the profile she admired for she saw it cleancut against the passing
landscape for the sixty miles of daylight out of the seventyfive miles
home while she sat beside its owner and tried many times to draw him
into talk His taciturnity on this particular day was a thing beyond any
experience with it she had yet had She had heard Burns talk and talk
well on many different subjects the while he sat upon the Chesters
porch of a summer evening the three of them about him and he had
seemed to enjoy talking He certainly could not be wholly occupied with
the machine for at no time did he let the engine out for what it could
do but contented himself with a steady moderate pace very different
from the sort of furious speed in which he and the Green Imp were
accustomed to indulge when occasion offered Altogether he presented to
the girl a problem which she could not solve and was never further from
solving than during the seventyfive miles she sat beside him on the run
home

Youre all to come in and have an icecool salady supper with us
Mrs Macauley declared as the car turned in at the home driveway Hot
coffee too if you want itor even beefsteak if you prefer But I
thought since it was so hot

Ill take the beefsteak announced Burns over his shoulder if I find
nothing urgent for me to do If theres a call

If there is make it and you shall have the beefsteak when you get
back Martha promised him Mrs Macauley was of the sort of young
married woman who delights to make her friends comfortableand none
better than Red Pepper who was her husbands most valued friend as he
was that of his neighbour on the other side Arthur Chester

To everybodys regret the call was waiting and as the party went in
to supper they waved their hands at the Green Imp flying away down the
road It was not till long after the icecool salady supper was
ended and the women freshly clad were sitting on the porch again the
men smoking on the steps below them that tine Green Imp came back

Ten minutes later a large figure crossed the lawn at a pace which
suggested both reluctance and fatigue

If it hadnt been for that beefsteak Burns began

You wouldnt have come finished Macauley Oh we know that Go in
and get it Red and perhaps afterward the charms of human society will
have their inning

Whether or not the beefsteak made the difference a change had taken
place when R P Burns at length returned to the comforts of the porch
He threw himself upon a crimson cushion on the upper step precisely at
the feet as it chanced of Ellen Lessing As he leaned comfortably back
against the porch pillar he looked directly up into her face his eyes
meeting hers with an odd searching expression as if he now saw her for
the first time Pauline gazing enviously across saw the black eyes
meet the hazel ones in the dim light and noted that a curiously long
look was exchangedthe sort of look which denotes that two people
are observing each other closely without attempt at producing an
impression only at discovering what is there

But when Burns began to talk he appeared to address the midsummer night
air staring off into it and speaking rather low so that they all
leaned forward to listen For at last he seemed to have something
other than motor cars upon his mind

Hes a mighty taking little chap he said musingly Curly black hair
eyes like coalswith a fringe around em like a hedge Cheeks none too
roundbut milk and eggs and good red steaks will take care of that A
body like a cherubswhen its filled out a bit

What in the name of gibberish are you giving as Red inquired
Macauley

Names Bob went on Red Pepper By all the odd chances Thats what
decided me Bobby Burnsit was the last straw

Is he crazy asked Chester of the company They seemed undecided They
were listening closely

Clothesone pair of patched breechesremember Little Breeches
Chesone faded flannel shirtmended till there wasnt much left to
mend A straw hat with a fringe around ituneven fringe Insidea
heartache as big as a little fellow could carry and stagger under it
Think of having the heartacheat five and for your grandmother

Why for his grandmother asked Winifred Chester

Because there wasnt anybody else to have it for Rest all gone
grandmother the one who attended the breeches and patched the shirt and
went without food herself lest the boys cheeks get thinner yet That
was what fixed her at lastshe hadnt enough vitality to pull her
through

So that was the matter with you today hazarded Chester Worried
about your patient all day and found youd lost her when you got back

Burns turned upon him with a characteristic flash You go join the
ranks of the snapshots They sometimes miss fire No I didnt Id
lost her before I went or I wouldnt have gone not for you or any other
boxparty It was the kiddie that was on my mindas Id seen him last

Where is he now asked Martha Macauley urgently She was the mother of
two small sons and Burnss sketch had interested her

He looked up at her Want to see him

Of course I do Did you take him to somebody in town Are you going to
send him to the asylum in the city

Do you want to see him Burns inquired of Winifred Chester He rose

Red What do you mean Have you got a child here

Come along all of you if you like He wont wake up Hes sleeping
like a topcant help it with all that bread and milk inside of him
Part cream it was too I saw Cynthia chucking it in Hed got her good
and plenty in the first five minutes Bless her susceptible heart Come
on

Talk of susceptible hearts jeered Macauley as he followed Theres
the softest one in the county

Nobody would ever guess it murmured Pauline Hempstead

They tiptoed into the house across the offices into the big square
room which was Burnss own He switched on a hooded readinglight beside
the bed and turned it so that its rays fell on the small occupant

He lay in spreadeagle smallchild fashion arms and legs thrown wide
the black curly head disdaining the pillow one fist clutching a
mans ridingcrop In sleep the little face was an exquisite one the
onlookers might guess what it would be awake

Burns pointed at the crop smiling That was the nearest approach to
a plaything I could muster tonight Tomorrow the shops will help me
out

Ill send over plenty in the morning Red whispered Martha Macauley
Her eyes were suspiciously shiny

Did you bring him home just now questioned Winifred

Burns nodded I hadnt meant to get him tonight if I did at all My
call took me within half a mile I went over and saw him again That
settled it

The small sleeper stirred sighed Burns turned off the light in a
twinkling Hes not used to electricity point blank he chuckled

Going down the steps a hand touched his arm He looked into Ellen
Lessings upturned face and discovered anew that it was a face to hold
the attention of a man But there was no coquetry in it Instead he
saw a stirred look in eyes which struck him suddenly as singularly like
those of the child he had just shown her black with a fringe around
em

Doctor Burns she said will you give me the very great pleasure of
dressing the boy I know how to do it

Of course if you want to he responded gladly I hoped you ladies
would look after that

Let me do it alone she urged They have their children it would
only be a task to them To meI cant tell you what a delight it would
be

Ill take you and Bob to the city in the morning if youll go

It will be a happy morning for Bob and me then she answered and he
saw it in her face that it would be But he felt that it was because
of the boy not for any other reason It occurred to him that it might
possibly be a happy morning for the driver of the Green Imp also

So Ellens going to dress the brat Macauley was strolling over
the lawn with Chester and Burns as having outsat the women on the
Macauley porch the men were turning bedward reluctant to leave the
cool starshine of the July night Its easy to see why she wants to do
that Her threeyearold boy would have been just about this Bobs age
by now Tough luck wasnt itwhen he was all she had left since Jack
got out of the game

Burns stared at him Oh thats why I didnt know about her boy or
Id forgotten it if I was ever told She will enjoy fitting Bob out if
I can keep her from putting him into white clothes to make him resemble
an angel instead of a small boy with an eye for dirt

Youll find Ellens no fool Macauley assured him warmly But if she
takes an interest in the boy itll be the best thing that could happen
to him She has a lot of money She may get a notion to adopt him

But upon this Red Pepper Burns spoke with decision Confound you the
kiddie belongs to me Didnt I tell you his name is now Robert Burns
She may dress him if she likes She cant have him not by a long shot
Hes mine

Oh well it might be arranged murmured Macauley but not quite low
enough In a flash he was laid flat on his back on the lawn a menacing
figure standing over him

None of that growled the man with the temper Not now or any other
time Then he laughed and let his victim up Alcohol will take out
grass stains Jim he advised Tell Martha that




CHAPTER IV IN WHICH HE MAKES A CONCESSION



Red Pepper Burns opened his eyes What on earth was that A small voice
piping at him from within close range But how could that be

Something bumped against him He turned his head on his pillow A small
figure at his side had raised itself upon its elbow big black eyes in a
pale little face were staring at him in affright Burns roused himself
suddenly very wide awake indeed

Its all right little man said he pulling the child gently into the
warmth of his encircling arm You came home with me last night Dont
you remember Youre going to make me a visit And this morning after
breakfast were going to drive to town and buy a train of carsred
shiny cars and an engine with a bell on it What do you think of that

It did not take long to change Bobs fright into the happiest
anticipations Red Pepper Burns was at his best with children he had
what their mothers called a way with them

A knock at the door and Cynthias voice calling Heres some things for
the little boy Doctor put an end to a full halfhour of delightful
comradeship during which the sheets of the bed had became a tent and
the two were soldiers resting after a days march Burns rose and took
in the parcel Martha Macauley had sent it Her boy Harold was the
nearest in size to Bob of any of the children of his neighbours and the
parcel held everything needed from undershirt to scarlet Windsor scarf
to tie under the rolling collar of the blue blouse

A bath first Bob and his new guardian initiated him into the
exciting experience of a splash in a big white tub in water decidedly
warmer than it would be a week hence when he should have become used
to the invigorating cool plunge Then Burns glowing from contact with
water as cold as it could be got from the tap clad in bathrobe and
slippers attempted to solve the mysteries of Bobs toilet Roars
of laughter interspersed with high pipings of glee presently brought
Cynthia to the door

Cant I help you Doctor Burns she called anxiously

Not a bit of it Cynthia much obliged Im having the time of my
life Stand still son lets try it this way round came back to the
housekeepers ears

I aint never wore so many things before Bob declared doubtfully as a
small white waist with dangling elastic stockingsupporters was finally
discovered to go best buttoned in the back

I know But youll see how fine it is to have your stockings held up
for you Hi Here are some sandals Bob Barefoot sandals only well
wear them over stockings today since were going shopping Now for
these blue garments I wonder how they go Shapelesslooking things they
look to me I suppose theyll resolve into baggy knickers and the sort
of long shirt with a belt to it the youngsters of your age all wear
Here we go Does this top part button behind Bob like the waist No
I think not It sure looks odd whichever way we don it but that
may be because its pretty big Harolds several sizes bigger than you
though he cant be much older Give me six months and Ill have you
filling out any other fiveyearolds clothes

My handstheyre all gone remarked the child holding out his arms
The blue sleeves did indeed cover them to the fingertips Laughing
Burns rolled the cloth back making an awkward bunch at the wrist but
allowing the small hands freedom

When Mrs Lessing trains her eye on you shell want to make time
getting to the shops Burns observed struggling with the scarlet scarf
and finally tying it like a fourinhand But youre clean Bob and
hungry I hope Now I want a great big hug to pay me for dressing you

He held out his arms and his new charge sprang into them pressing arms
like sticks around the strong neck of the man who seemed to him already
the best friend he had in the worldas he was

At eleven oclock a round of calls made the Green Imp came for Bob
and Mrs Lessing They met him hand in hand the little figure in its
voluminous misfit clothes looking quaint enough beside the perfect
outlines of his companions attire But both faces were very happy

How many dollars do you suppose Ellen has stowed away in that handsome
purse of hers ready to spend on the child Martha Macauley queried
of Winifred Chester as they watched the Green Imp out of sight from the
Macauley porch

Mrs Chester shook her head Ive no idea Shell want to get him
everything a child could have But Red wont let her

He wont know Hell drop them at a store and go off to the hospital
The things will come home by special delivery and the next thing he
sees will be Bob in silk socks and white linen

I dont believe it Hell go shopping with them Hes wild over the
boy and he doesnt care a straw what people might think who saw the
three together Hell tyrannize over Ellenand shell let him for the
pleasure of being ruled by a man once more

It was a shrewd prophecy and goes to show that women really understand
each other pretty wellwomen of the same sort For Red Pepper Burns did
go shopping with the pair from start to finish It was an experience he
did not see any occasion for missing

You wont mind my coming too was all the permission he asked and
Mrs Lessing answered simply Surely not if you care to We shall want
your judgment

She had not conducted them to a department store but to the small shop
of a decidedly exclusive childrens outfitter Burns knew nothing about
the presumably greater cost of buying a wardrobe in a place like this
but he soon scented danger He scrutinized certain glass showcases
containing wax lay figures of pinkcheeked youngsters attired as for the
stage and boomed his first caution into his companions ear

Thats not the sort of puppet we want to make out of Bob eh he
suggested

She turned smiling Not unless you intend to keep him in a glass case
Doctor Burns

No longtrousered imitation of a sailorboy either please said he
pointing disfavour in his eye at the presentment of a curlyheaded
infant of five in a Jacktar outfit of white flannel topped by an
expensive straw hat

I see youre not going to trust me murmured Mrs Lessing as a
slimwaisted trailingblackgowned saleswoman approached

Ill trust you but I intend to keep my eye on you admitted
Burns frankly He observed with interest the wonderful figure of the
saleswoman Quite possibly that lady thought he was admiring her for
nothing in his face could have told her that he was mapping out in his
surgeons mind her physical anatomy and speculating as to where in
the name of Hygeia she could have disposed of her digestive organs in a
circumference the diminutive size of that

Underwear first Mrs Lessing went straight at the foundations of Bobs
make up and began to look over boxes of little gossamer shirts and tiny
union suits of a fabric so delicately fine that Burns handled a fold of
it suspiciously

Silk he questioned

She shook her head the corners of her mouth curving Only a thread
now and then Mostly lislefor very hot weather These others have some
wool in them for cooler days Those nearest you are quite warm though
very light in weight For really cold weather

Youre not planning to watch the thermometer and keep him changing
underwear accordingly

Not at all Doctor Burns But four weights for the year arent too
many are they

Are you buying for a year ahead

Please let me I shall not be here when he needs to change

Their eyes met Something in hers made him desist from argument

Stockings came next Mrs Lessing bought substantial tan ones in
quantity long and well reenforced Then she took up socks of russet
and of white Shall you object to his wearing these a good deal she
asked Burns He took up one small sample running his fingers into it
I should think he might put his toes through one of those in an hour
or two he suggested His legs are pretty thin Do you think pipestem
legs in short socks to say nothing of bruises and scratches really
attractive

You want him to go barefooted a good deal of the time dont you

Sure But legs in socks are neither fish flesh nor good red herring
to my thinking

In spite of the smile on his lips he looked obstinate and she
deliberated drawing a white sock unmistakably fine and expensive over
her graygloved hand Plainly she wanted to see Bob in socks and strap
slippers of the sort her boy would have worn As she studied the sock
Burns studied her profile Get him a pair for your own satisfaction
he conceded

He did not hear the order she gave but the saleswoman was pleasantly
smiling as she checked it

The next thing that happened Bob was being measured Then he was trying
on Russian blouse suits that fitted practical little garments of blue
galatea of tancoloured linen crash even of brown holland Burns
looked on approvingly The clothes turned Bob into a gentlemans son no
doubt of that but it was the sort of gentlemans son who can have the
very best of romping good times

Something diverted Bumss attention for a little and when he turned
back to Bob a bright scarlet reefer had been pulled on over his blouse
and a wide sailor hat with a scarlet ribbon crowned his black curls The
result was engagingly picturesque But the critic frowned

Im afraid that wont do Mrs Lessing he objected decidedly

You dont like the colour Not with his hair and eyes

It wont hurt his hair but it will his eyes The sun on that red will
torture him

Will it I shouldnt have thought of it So many children wear them

And shortly come to spectacles Try it yourself for half an hour

She drew off the reefer Bob objected I like the red jacky Dotter
Burns he said It was his first comment Hitherto he had been in a
dazed state submitting wonderingly to this strange experience

Another small coat of tancoloured cloth with a gorgeous redandbrown
emblem on the sleeve consoled him

I think we are through said Mrs Lessing Burns looked at her

No white clothes he asked

Did you want him to have some

No But I thought you would

I have ordered three suits to be made for him she admitted flushing
a little They will be very plain and will launder beautifully He will
wear them only on special occasions Do you mind

Well not on those conditions he agreed reluctantly

They went to a shoe shop and Bob became the richer for leather sandals
canvas shoes and various other footwear some of it undeniably fine
Burns took one little black slipper into his hand

I wonder what Bobs grandmother would say to that he observed in a
whisper

Ellen Lessing regarded its mate Her lashes hid her eyes but her lip
quivered and he saw it The salesman was busy with Bob Burns laid his
hand for an instant on hers She looked up and a smile struggled with
the tears

A toy shop came last Here Bob was in an ecstasy His companions walked
up and down the aisles following his eager steps Mrs Lessing would
have filled his arms but she found the way obstructed

He may have the train of cars Burns consented But they must be cars
hell have to pull about for himself No not the trotting horse nor
the trolley on the track nor any other of the mechanical stuff Ill
get him that dandy little toolchest and that box of building blocks
but thats enough

The mechanical toys are of the best sir suggested the salesman
They wont break except with pretty rough handling

Thats bad Burns asserted The quicker they broke the less
objection Id have to em Its a wonder the modern child has a trace
of resource or inventiveness left in him Teach him to construct not to
destroy then youve done something for him

Isnt he rather young for tools Mrs Lessing was turning over a small
saw in her hands feeling its sharp teeth with a premonitory finger

There are gauze and bandages in the office He laughed at her
expression as she laid down the saw

You wont object to that box of tin soldiers she asked

Decidedly You dont want to spoil him at the start For a boy who
never had a toy in his life hes acquired enough now to turn his head
Come away Mrs Lessingflee temptation Come Bobby boy And Burns
led the way

Bob astride of a marvellous rockinghorse taller than himself was like
to weep Mrs Lessing went to him He whispered something in her ear
She came back to Burns

Doctor Burns said she every boy has a rockinghorse Hes just
the age to enjoy it Surely it wont hazard his inventiveness it will
develop it Hell ride all over the country as you do in the Green
Imp

Whats the price

Its not costly and its a very good one

Burns inquired the price again this time he asked the salesman Then he
spoke low

Fifteen dollars seems not costly to you I suppose Think of Bob
yesterday with not a toy to his name

Thats why I want to give him one today

Hell be just as happy riding a stickas soon as he forgets this

He wont forget it Look at his eyes

Youre looking at his eyes all the time Thats what undoes you

He had to look away from her eyes then himself or he felt quite
suddenly that he too would have been undone He had resisted the
entreaty in womens eyes many times but not always despite the
reputation he held for indifference

Doctor Burns wont you give me this one pleasure Youve really been
quite firm all the morning

She was smiling but he had himself in hand again and he was blunt
with her Bobs bachelors child now he said He must be trained
according to bachelors ideas Come you know its out of reason to give
the youngster any more today Be sensible

They followed him out of the store Bobs hand held fast in hers
Somehow they both looked very young as they stood outside the shop
window gazing back at the marvellous display within He felt as if he
were being rather cruel to them both This was absurd of course when
one considered the box of blocks the train of cars and the toolkit The
child had enough playthings already to send him out of his head Burns
drove away rapidly to get out of range of other windows which seemed
filled with rockinghorses today

He looked down at Bob

Happy little chap he asked

Bob nodded His arms clasped the red train but he was not looking at it

Like the cars

Bob nodded His wide sailor hat obscured his face Burns could see only
the tip of the small nose

Youll have a splendid time with those blocks wont you

Again the nod but no reply

The hammers pretty nice too isnt it

Once more the dumb answer But the silence seemed odd for Bob had long
since lost his fear of these companions

Look up here Bob

Reluctantly the child obeyed Burns caught one fleeting glimpse of wet
black lashes One big tear was slowly stealing down the pale little
cheek

Whats the matter old man

No reply

Burns looked at Ellen Lessing behind Bobs back She did not meet his
glance She was looking at the boy It struck him that her profile made
the most enchanting outline he had ever seen He tried to steel his
heart against them both He knew his theory was right he now had the
chance to put it into practice

The Green Imp turned a corner to the right They were not yet out of the
city and at the next block the car turned another corner also to the
right At the end of another block the Imp swerved once moreto
the right This brought them back to the wide street which led to the
shopping district they had lately left With silent passengers the Imp
threaded its way to the toy shop In front of it Burns stopped the car
He got out and went in and came out the big rockinghorse in the arms
of the salesman who followed him

He looked up at their faces Bobs was one wideeyed countenance of
incredulous joy The othersif he had seen there satisfaction at
having brought a man to terms he felt he should have despised her but
that was not what he saw

There was by planning carefully just room to wedge the rockinghorse
in at Mrs Lessings feet without encroaching on the steeringgear As
they drove off Bob was bending over and gently stroking the animals
splendid black mane with little chuckles and gurgles of joy Once more
Burns looked at Ellen Lessing behind Bobs back

Youre happy now arent you he asked in tone of assurance Then
confound it I must own Im paid for letting my wise bachelor notions go
hang just for this time

Thank you she answered very gently And Im paid for trying to be
reasonable

He laughed suddenly content Between them the little lad who had never
owned a toy in his life stowing the red train carefully away between
has feet gave himself wholly to the rockinghorse


Well Ellen was Martha Macauleys greeting to her sister did you
have as interesting a time dressing the child as you expected

I had a charming time replied Mrs Lessing She shook the dust out of
her long gray veils smiling at her memory of the morning

Did R P prove docile

Docile doesnt seem to me just the word

I used it in an attempt at fine irony explained Mrs Macauley

Well was he tractable then

He was very polite and kind and jollyuntil the real business of
shopping began Then he became suspiciousand a trifle autocratic She
recalled his look as he told her that he would trust her but that he
meant to keep an eye upon her

Didnt you get your own way about anything demanded her sister with
eager curiosity

Ellen looked at her Martha noted that the soft black eyes were glowing
and that she had not seen Ellen appear more alive and interested since
the days before trouble came to her Do you imagine we fought a battle
over our shopping she asked her lips curving with merriment

But you dont tell me Im anxious to know whether we shall see the boy
dressed according to Reds ideas or yours

We agreed beautifully on nearly all points of his dressing Where we
differed wecompromised

Red never compromises with anybody so I suppose it was done by your
giving in

He never compromises You do him injustice He can compromise
royallyby the same method of giving in

I simply cant believe it murmured Martha shaking her head




CHAPTER V IN WHICH HE IS ROUGH ON A FRIEND


RED

Yes

Are you through with that rabble Can you tend to a friend

Redfield Pepper Burns wheeled around in his revolving chair and glanced
sharply at Arthur Chester What he saw made him follow the moments
inspection with a direct question

Sit down What have you been doing

Chester sat down His face was white He held up one shaking hand Red
whats the matter with me

Burns continued to study the man before him He made no move to examine
into his condition just looked steadily into the others face with a
gaze before which his patient presently shifted uneasily

Well of all the ways to treat a fellow He tried to laugh Is that
the way you do with the rest of the bunch that come to you every day Or
are you trying to hypnotize me

Look me in the eye Ches What have you been doing

Working like a fiend in that infernal office If theres any hotter
place

Therell be a hotter one for you right on this earth if you keep on
the way youre going

He rose suddenly and approaching Chester closely looked intently into
the uplifted eyes He sat down again Own up he commanded bluntly

Red begged Chester quit this sort of thing Go at me in the usual
way II think Im a bit nervous tonight I cant stand your gunfire

All right When did you begin

Five weeks ago when you were away I didnt mean to get into it Red
on my word I didnt after all youve warned me But it was so beastly
hotand there was a lot of extra work at the office My head got to
going it night and day Isayhe leaned suddenly forward has head
on his handsI can tell you better if you give me some kind of a
bracerI feelsodeadly

Burns got up and prepared something in a glass something not
particularly palatable but when it had taken action which it promptly
did Chesters white face had acquired a tinge of colour and he could go
on

I stopped in Gardners office one day when my head was worse than
usual Had to meet a man in ten minutesimportant deal on for the
househad to be at my best Told Gardner so He fixed me

He didblame himfixed you for a dopefiend Ive told you a hundred
times you had precisely the kind of temperament that must avoid that
sort of thing like the gallows Burns hit the desk with his fist as he
spoke with a thump of impatience

It seems to set me up for a whileI can do anything Then afterward

Youre getting the afterward all right How much do you take

Chester mentioned the amount of the drug stating reluctantly that for
the last two days he had been obliged slightly to increase it in order
to get the full effect

Of course you havethats the insidiousness of the devils stuff How
soon does it get into action

Oh right awayalmost instantly

What Is your imagination strong enough toSee here ChesBurns
leaned forward youre taking the stuff by mouth of course

Chesters eyes went down WhyI tried it that waybut it was so
slow

Burns ejaculated something under his breath the quick colour always
ready to flare under his clear skin leaped out

Gardner gave you a hypo I suppose

Yes

So you went and bought a syringe and taught yourself the trick Suppose
you give me a look at it

Like a shamed schoolboy Chester unwillingly drew forth the small case
from his pocket Burns received it He opened it and took out the tiny
instrument It looks like a very good one he observed with a sort
of deadly quietness and with one motion of his big fingers snapped the
glass barrel in two

At this Chester took fire Thats going a little too far he burst out
in wrath

Is it Thought it was you who had gone too far Its up to me to bring
you backwhile I can Getting this little fiend out of the way is the
first step Keep cool Chesand Ill try to do the same though it
makes my blood boil to think how little youve cared for my lectures to
you on this very thing

I have cared But I had no idea

Well you have one now Its taken you five weeks to acquire enough of
a habit to give you some trouble to drop it Youre that sort and
thats the way it works anyhow I wonder you came to me tonight Found
yourself out of the stuff and didnt like to try to get it here where
folks know you

If you want to put everything in the most disagreeable way you
canyes admitted Chester testily

Thats precisely what I want to do Put it in such a disagreeable way
that your backbonell stiffen up a bit and give us something to start
with If I make you mad all the betterso long as you dont go back
to fools like Gardner who never hesitate to give a fellow like you a
sample of what that drugll do for em

What are you going to do I shant sleep tonight and Ive got to be
in the office tomorrow morning

Whens your vacation due

Not till week after next

Arrange to take it now

I cant Stillingers off on his Monday morning

Could you have yours now if he waited

Yes but I wouldnt ask him

I would Burns took down the receiver of his desk telephone

Red stopI dont want

Burns paid no attention to him In five minutes he had the city
connection and his man He stated the case Chester was in urgent need
of taking his vacation without delay but was not willing to ask the
favour of his office associate He Burns his friends physician did
not scruple to ask it if it would not interfere too seriously with Mr
Stillingers plans No diplomat could re quest a favour more courteously
than R P Burns MD The reply was the one to be expected of
Stillinger bachelor and amiable fellow who was fond of Chester and
hoped it was nothing serious Tell him to go ahead with his vacation
Stillinger said and not to worry over office affairs

Now Burns wheeled round from the telephone Will you put yourself in
my hands

Do you honestly think Im such an abandoned casealready began
Chester unhappily that you have to

Listen to me Ches I dont think youre an abandoned casethats
nonsenseafter five weeks But I do think youre well started on a road
that its ruin to travel You began it way back last winter by taking
that headache stuff in double the dose I gave you without consulting
me every time you felt a trifle below par Thats why I took it
away from you You felt the loss of it and you were an easy mark for
Gardners dope Youve grown so dependent on that already that youre
going to have a fight to get along without it You cant fight and do
office work so Im going to make the most of my chance during this
fortnights vacationif youll give me leave If you wontI think
Ill knock you down and get you where I want you that way

He smileda smile with so much spirit and affection in it that
Chesters eyes filled to his own astonishment for up to this point he
had been both hurt and angry After a moment he said with his eyes on
the floor but in a different tone from any he had yet used Go ahead
Red Ill try to prove I have some stuff in me yet

Of course you have Burnss hand was on his friends shoulder Thats
what Im counting on Prove it by following directions to the letter
And begin by coming with me for a trip into the country I have to see a
case before I go to bed and the air will do your head good

It was the first of many similar trips Arthur Chester may fairly have
been said to spend the succeeding fortnight in the company of the Green
Imp and its driver From morning till night and often in the night
itself when he found it impossible to sleep he was living in the open
air by means of this device Of walking also he did an increasing
amount as his strength grew under the regimen Burns insisted upon But
for the first week in spite of all the help his physician could give
him he found himself indeed involved in a fierce strugglea struggle
with shaken and unmanageable nerves with a desperate craving for the
soothing uplifting effect of the drug to which he was forced to admit
he had become perilously accustomed with a black depression of spirit
which was worse than anything else he had to combat

It was at the worst of one of these periods of darkness that alone with
his patient upon a hilltop where the two had climbed leaving the
Green Imp at a point where the road had become impossible Burns said
suddenly

Ches I believe with all my care to give you the treatment I thought
you needed Ive failed to point out the most potent remedy of all

Chester shook his head Youve done everything Red All the troubles
with me Im so pitiably weakso much weaker than I ever dreamed I
could be I cant seem to care whether I get out of this or not All I
want is to lie down and go to sleepand never wake up

The last words came under his breath but Burns heard them He showed no
sign of being startled though this mood was a gloomier one than he had
yet seen his patient succumb to Instead he went on talking in a tone
of confidence

I ought to have known enough to apply this remedy because its one
Ive tried myself If you could know since the night you heard me
make a certain vow what a time Ive had with myself to keep it youd
understand that I know what it means to try to break up a habit
Mines the habit of years With my temper and some of my associations
intemperate profanitys been the easiest thing in the world to fall
into When things went wrong out would come the oaths like water out
of a springthough thats a false comparison like the filth out of a
sewer Id better say

We all swear more or less acknowledged Chester his head in his
hands

Not as I didand you know it Ive been responsible for many a boys
taking it up though I didnt realize it Because I was athletic and in
for sports with them they thought I was the whole thing They laughed
when I got mad and ripped out a lot of language they copied it But
I never heard myself as others hear me till that night I let go at the
mother whod ignorantly murdered her boy by disobeying orders On the
way home that night I woke upcame to myselfI dont know how The
stars were unusually bright and I looked up at them and thought of that
childs soul going back to its Maker and then thought of my curses
following it and coming to His ear

A silence fell When Burns broke it it was in a voice deep with
feeling

The next words I sent up to that ear were in a different shape I
think it was the first real prayer Id ever said since the little parrot
prayers my mother taught me That was the first it hasnt been the
last I dont suppose I say much that would sound like the preachers
language but Ches what I do believe is thatI get what I ask for
Thatshelp to fight my temptations And profanity isnt the only one
nor the toughest one to down

Chester looked up For a moment he forgot himself and his wretchedness
Its hard to believe its you Redtalking like this

I know it must be hard but it ought to be the more convincing on that
account I belong to a profession of materialists and all at once its
grown to seem to me the strangest thing in life that a man who studies
the anatomy of this body of ours should be a materialist To watch its
workings and then doubt the God who made it is sheet wilful blindness
But ChesIve got my eyes open at last The God who made me is up
there and He knows and cares how I go on with the job As for answering
my appeals for help when I get hard pressedthe biggest sign I have of
that is a human one Since Bobby Burns came to sleep in that little bed
next mine its been a whole lot easier to get on

A deep sigh was Chesters reply to this He had a small boy and girl of
his own For their sakes and Winifreds he knew he must fight this fight
out and win But as for getting tangible help from the Creator of a body
handicapped by nerves like his He began to say this but Burns broke in
upon him with the answer he would least have expected at a moment like
this a great ringing laugh the sound of which brought the slow blood
to Chesters white face

If you consider wrecked nerves like mine a laughing matter he broke
out

But Burns his laugh over was sober again and his voice was earnest
Arthur Chester dont make Him responsible for your wrecked nerves
They werent wrecked when you were furnished with them Youve done the
wrecking yourself by breaking pretty nearly every law that governs the
workings of the human machine Youre paying the penalty But youre
going to get the upper hand From now on in spite of your office life
youre going to get good red blood in your veinsand your brains The
worst is over nowthe second week will be easier But what Im trying
to tell you is that youll get that upper hand a lot quicker ifhis
cheek grew hot with this strange unaccustomed effort at putting things
he had never spoken of before into wordsif youll just reach up and
take hold of that Upper Hand that according to my new belief and
experience is ready to reach down to you Its stronger than yours
youll feel the upward pull

He broke off and got to his feet The two had been sitting on a fallen
log looking off over the hills toward a distant river winding its blue
length through fields of living green

I wasnt exactly cut out for a preacher Ches he added after a
minute I hope my talk doesnt sound to you like cant Im a pretty
poor specimen of a chap to be setting up my own example for anybody to
follow

I dont think youve been setting up your own example Chester
replied He pulled himself up limply from the log yet out of his face
had gone the black look which had been there when he came up the hill
And what youve said doesnt sound like cant to me Red It sounds
more like can

Red Pepper Burns held out his hand His big warm fingers closed hard
over the thin cold ones which met them Then the two men without more
words went away down the hill From this hour Arthur Chester afterward
dated the beginning of the end of the fight




CHAPTER VI IN WHICH HE PRESCRIBES FOR HIMSELF


Red observed James Macauley junior this place of yours looks like
a drunkards home

He glanced around him as he spoke The criticism certainly found
justification in every corner No more neglected office could have been
discovered belonging to any practitioner within an area of many miles

I suppose it does rejoined Burns from the depths of a big dusty
leather chair where he sat stretched in an attitude expressing extreme
fatigue But I dont care a hang

Macauley looked at him His eyes were closed His arms lay upon the
chair arms relaxed and limp For the first time his friend observed
what might have been noted by a critical eye on any day during the last
fortnight The lines on the ordinarily strong healthtinted face were
deeper than he had ever seen them the cheeks were thinner there were
even shadows under the thick eyelashes which outlined the lids of the
closed eyes

Look here old man Macauley cried sudden conviction seizing him
youre working altogether too hard This miserable city epidemic has
done you out Ive thought all the time you were trying to cover too
much ground

Grounds had to be covered replied the other briefly without opening
his eyes

Have the other fellows worked as hard as you

Harder

I dont believe it Theyre all city men Youve done all this city
work and looked after your own patients here too to say nothing of
living in both places at once With your housekeeper gone home to her
sick folks and Miss Mathewson off on one of your casesno wonder this
place looks the way it does

It doesnt matter Cut it out about the place Im going back in ten
minutes

You are Not going to get to bed

Dont know I might snatch a nap now if youd quit talking

Macauley closed his mouth Presently he got up and stole out of the
room He was back again in a trice a flask in one hand a soda siphon
in the other and a small glass balanced on his thumb When Burns at
the sound of a clock ticking somewhere rubbed his eyes with his fists
striking in and reluctantly opened them Macauley spoke briskly

See hereIm going to give you a bracer I know your confounded
notions but they dont cut any figure when you need something to pull
you together the way you do tonight

He started to measure out the amber liquid into the glass but Burns put
up a hand

Much obliged but I dont want any

You idiotdont you know when to make an exception to your rule I
admit youve won out over the other fellows just by keeping a steady
hand but youre dead as a dog for rest tonight and you need a stiff
one if Im any judge

Youre notfor me Burns sat up O Heavens man if I were going to
break my rule at all it wouldnt be for a drink of anything It would be
for a stab in the arm with something that beats your stuff all out for
stimulating the fatigue out of a fellow and making him feel like working
till he drops

Why dont you have it then asked Macauley curiously I should think
if ever a usedup chap were justified in

Dont give me that talk if youre my friend Its hard enough to hold
out without resorting to that game I dont need you to advise it Ive
seen enough of that sort of suicide Buller and Fields are both down and
out and they began to brace early in the epidemic Van Horns a wreck
though he keeps going and I tell you Ive more respect for that man
than I ever had before Hes a poseur and a toadier no doubt of that
and Ive always despised him for it but he has real ability and
hes worked like a fiend through this muss and not all for his rich
patients either But hes weakening fast and its drug stimulation
thats done it No sir not for mine But Ill make myself a cup of
coffee for Ive got to keep awake and I shall sleep in my tracks if I
dont

He got up and stumbled out into his deserted kitchen Macauley followed
helping as best he knew how and watched his friend gulp down two
cupfulls of a muddy liquid with feeling of admiration such as a small
act of large significance may sometimes stir in one who apprehends

Two days later Burns starting toward home in the Imp at a late hour in
the morning passed a figure on a corner of a city street waiting for
the outwardbound trolley He slowed down beside it

May I take you home he asked cap in hand and interest showing in
eyes which a moment before had been heavy with fatigue

Ellen Lessing looked up I shall be very glad she answered as she
met his outstretched hand and let it draw her upward to the vacant
seat The car is always so full at this hour and I was longing for the
feeling of the wind against my face

Its cool for late August and youll get a breeze on the road home
that will refresh you You havent touched water or milk in this
plaguestricken district I hope

No indeed Martha warned me a dozen times before I left How are
things Any better

No new cases in twentyfour hours and the old ones well in hand Im
getting home earlier today than Ive done for a month and hope to have
a few hours off duty I was planning what to do with them as I came upon
you

I should think you could do nothing better with them than to go
home and sleep she advised looking up at his face with a critical
friendly survey of the signs of weariness written plainly there You
are worn out and that means something when one says it of so strong a
man as you

I could sleep a week but Im not sure that a few hours would more
than aggravate my need Besides I shouldnt be at home an hour before
I should be called out again No my plans were forming themselves
differently and now that Ive met you theyre taking definite shape I
wantwellsuppose I dont tell you Would you trust me to take you off
on a restseeking expedition without explaining what I mean to do

On a restseeking expedition she repeated Doctor Burns are you
sure you hadnt better go on that alone Suppose I chatter all the way

He smiled Youre not a chatterer And I dont want to go alone I
havent had a chance for an hour with you for a month I think This is
the only way I can get it Will you go

You provoke my curiosity Yes I think Ill go Ive been shopping
all the morning and I deserve a reward of rest if youre sure you know
where to find it

He turned the Imp abruptly aside from the boulevard leading out of town
down which they had been speeding He made a detour of certain side
streets which brought him up before a small side establishment bearing a
sign which set forth an alluring invitation to motoring parties in need
of food He disappeared therein and was absent for the space of a full
twenty minutes When he returned he was followed by a waiter with a
hamper to whose bestowal in the back of the car he looked carefully

As they sped away again Burns turned to his companion a smile of
anticipation on his face to meet a glance of some apprehension

Youre not repenting your rash trust of me already are you he
demanded

Im remembering that Martha has four guests at luncheon today and
expects me to be there

Is that all Dont let that worry you Well simply have a breakdown
somewhere on the road conveniently near to a spot I know where I
can broil the beefsteak I have in that hamper and make the coffee
Unavoidable detention will be your apology

Irresistible temptation will be my confession she admitted Im
not good at subterfuge and Im so hungry that the mere mention of
beefsteak outofdoors

If it weighs against the plates and salads of a womans luncheon I
shall have a great respect for you Come on lets run away You from
social duties I from professional ones Ill agree to stand out Martha
in your defense Unless of course the opportunity to wear a pretty
frock and throw all the other women in the shade

She laughed Thats precisely what Martha wants me to do

Then fail her and let the other women win Its too late to repent
anyhow for heres where we turn off

The Imp itself seemed to be running away so swiftly and silently
it covered the new road leading off into the hills Presently it was
climbing them

I want to get where no callboy monotonously repeating Doctor
Burrns Doctor Burrns can get hold of me the Imps driver
explained I suppose youre not dressednor shodfor a rough walk of
a quarter of a mile where the car cant go

Ill sacrifice skirts and soles she promised Isnt the air out here
glorious I thought I was tired when I left the city now I could climb
that hill and enjoy it

Thats precisely what well do then Theres a view from the top worth
the scramble but I wasnt sure youd be game for it Perhaps Ill know
you better at the end of this afternoon than I do now Is there a jolly
athletic girl hidden away under that demure manner of yours Ive seen so
far I wonder

Lead the way up that hill and youll find out she answered with a
challenging flash of her dark eyes

He lodged the Imp among a clump of pines got out the hamper and turned
to his companion She had pulled off her gloves removed hat and veil
and folded her long gray coat away in the car This left her dressed in
the trim gray skirt of walking length and the gray silk blouse she had
worn for shopping Burns looked at her with approval

Transformed by magic from a fashionable lady in street attire to a
girl ready for the woods was his comment Im glad you leave off the
hatIll match you by doffing the cap Now arent we a pair Are you in
for a rush up that first slope Jove Im not half so tired as I was an
hour ago already

He caught her hand in his his other arm through the hamper handle and
ran with her up the slope At the edge of the steeper climb to come they
stopped breathing fast This isnt the way to begin of course
he admitted as they both regained their breath laughing at their
own enthusiasm but I couldnt resist that dasha sort of dash for
freedom Now well take it more easily

They worked their way up and up among the rocks he always in advance
reaching down a muscular right arm to help her at the steeper places
and once giving her a knee to step on when progress could be made only
up the straight face of a big boulder It was undoubtedly a stiff climb
for a woman but she showed no signs of flinching and though her cheeks
glowed richly and her wavy black locks were a trifle loosened from their
usual order when at last she set foot upon the plateau at the top she
showed only the temporary fatigue to be expected after such unusual
exertion

That makes the blood course through ones arteries in a way worth
while was his comment as he regarded with satisfaction the splendid
colour in her checks and the sparkle in her eyes Talk about rest
Thats the way to get it Burn up the products of fatigue replace them
with fresh cells full of oxygen and you get rejuvenation Look at that
stretch of country before us Isnt that worth the climb

Its glorious Ive often looked at this height as our car drove by
on the road over there and wanted to climb it But Martha and Jim are
always for reeling off miles and so I thought were you I imagined
there was nobody but myself to care for this

And I thought you liked the porch and the pretty clothes you wear there
better than anything I could show you in the open he owned with a
laugh Not that I havent enjoyed that porch and the sight of the
clothesthey dont seem to be just like Marthas and Winifreds
somehow though I cant tell why Ive wanted to ask you off for a trip
like this but never was sure youd enjoy it Im glad Ive found out I
feel as if Id wasted the summer

He fell to gathering wood for his fire and when she had regained her
breath she helped him in spite of his remonstrance Let me have all the
fun too she begged I havent had a chance like this for four years
I used to camp in flannels all summer long in the roughest sort of
style and loved it dearly I could stand the tension of a long social
winter twice as well as the other women on account of it

He understood knowing that her husband had occupied a prominent
official position which called upon him to maintain a corresponding
place in the society of the city in which they had lived Although he
knew her to be still under thirty he realized that on account of her
early marriage she had had much experience in the world of affairs It
was this aspect of her he had always borne in mind as he had seen her
before Now he was beginning to recognize another side of her character
and tastes a side which interested him even more than the other had
done

Like a pair of children they collected their firewood racing together
to the base of operations with armfuls of dry sticks When there was
a big pile she surprised him by asking to be allowed to make the fire
herself

Ill prove to you Im a woodsman she asserted and when she had
performed her task after the most approved fashion of the skilled
camper he acknowledged that she had made good her boast As the smoke
cleared away in the direction which left the view unobscured and the
spot he had selected for the lunchingplace free from smoke he grinned
approvingly

Ive no doubt you could grill the steak and brew the coffee with equal
skill he admitted but Im not going to let you Thats my job I
want to prove my prowess Sit down on that log please and oversee me

She watched with hungry interest while he also gave evidence of his
craft It could hardly be the first time that a hamper had been packed
for him at the place in the city for nothing he needed had been left
out even to a big bottle of spring water with which to make the coffee
When his work was nearly complete she spread a square of white linen
upon a flat rock and set forth the other contents of the hamperolives
and bread and butter crisp celeryhearts and cream cheese and a tin
of biscuits She heated the plates and cups before the fire and as he
withdrew his steak from the coals she set a smoking hot platter before
him and offered him the materials for seasoning

Youre a crack camper for sure he declared Ahhdoes that steak
look fit for the gods or not Hows the coffee Clear

Perfect And the steak looks as if it would melt in ones mouth Oh
isnt this fun How glad I am Im here and not at that luncheon She
consulted a tiny watch Its two oclocktheyre sitting down she
exulted Martha has waited half an hour for me and given me up and
shes perfectly furious Im wicked enough to feel that that fact is
going to make this meal taste all the better

Stolen steak and bread and butter eaten in secret have an extra
relishno doubt of that Herethis juicy bit is for you to begin on
Set your teeth into it partner Hows that for food I ask of you

Sitting on the ground opposite each other with the flat rock between
they consumed this Arcadian banquet eating with the zest born of
exertion and the open air the sunshine and the comradeship

Nothing has tasted quite so good to me in a year said she when the
steak had vanished dipping a white celeryheart in salt and biting the
end off with teeth still whiter

Nothing ever tasted so good to me said he leaning on his elbow and
spreading a crisp biscuit with a layer of cheese I always think that
of each meal I eat in a place like this but this one seems to have a
special flavour I wonder if it can be the company

He smiled across at her the sunshine among the pine needles of the tree
above him throwing flecks of bright copper among the thick locks of his
hair

I think the company is usually an important part of all such outings
she admitted frankly I never took one before in the society of a
wornout doctor who began to look like a boy again before he had finished
his coffee I really shouldnt know you were the same person who invited
me to go on this expedition

Theres nothing like it for renewing one body and mind Actual
physical repose isnt often the best cure for weariness its change of
thought and occupation particularly if the open air is a part of the
cure Ive forgotten I have a care in the world all I can think of
ismay I say ityourself I cant get over the wonder of seeing you
turn from what Bob calls his pretty lady into the girl I see before
mea girl who looks about nineteen with a capacity for good sport in
the open air I never dreamed of

The open air would renew everybodys youth I think if everybody would
go to living outofdoors Were through arent we There isnt a crumb
left Now please go off and let me clear up and pack away Thats always
the womans part Couldnt you lie down on that inviting carpet of
needles over there under the big pine and get a bit of sleep

Sleepwhen I can talk to you

She nodded Yes indeed Im not going to talk just now anyhow so you
might as well make the best of it Throw yourself down with your hands
under your head and look up at those beautiful boughs Please

Rather reluctantly he obeyed and she could see that weary as he
undoubtedly still was in spite of the refreshing meal he really did not
want to lose any of her society Lying at full length on his side
his head propped on his hand talking in the lazy tone of afterdinner
content which had descended upon him he continued to watch her as she
repacked the hamper It was not until she deliberately forsook him that
he gave up to her wishes But when having been out of his sight for ten
minutes she peered cautiously through the bushes behind which she had
screened herself she saw what she had hoped for His whole weary frame
was stretched upon the pineneedle carpet the lines of his face were
relaxed and his eyes fast shut

The sun was far down the hills when he awoke He lay blinking at the
lowsweeping boughs above him for a little without realizing where he
was then as the midsummer stillness which surrounded him took hold of
his senses he turned his head to recall to himself the conditions under
which he had been sleeping Only the hamper under a tree close by
gave evidence that he was here by his own volition He stared about
remembering that he had had a companion He got somewhat stiffly to his
feet discovering as he did so that he had lain for a long time without
stirring from the position in which slumber had overtaken him

Mrs Lessing he called

From some distance away came back a blithe answer Here Doctor
Burns

He started in the direction of the voice and presently came upon her
sitting on a big granite boulder busy with a lapful of pine cones
out of which she seemed to be constructing something She looked up
smiling

Why in the world did you let me sleep all the afternoon he reproached
her

I should have wakened you in ten minutes more Have I made you late
for your work I understood that you could afford a few hours for rest
Youve only slept three

Three Good heavens When I might have been spending them with you

He looked so chagrined that her smile changed into outright laughter
You are very flattering But Ive been taking much more satisfaction in
your repose than I could possibly have done in your society no matter
how brilliant you might have been

Thats not flattering but I admit it has its practical side Those
three hours sleep in the open air have put me on my feet again Just
the same I want to eat my cake and have it too Promise me three
consecutive hours of your company when Im awake or I shant get
over regretting what Ive missed Will you do this again with me some
September day when I can make the time

I promise with pleasure Ive had a charming afternoon all by myself
and wandered all over the hillside dreaming midsummer daydreams We
must go mustnt we She stood up her hands full of her work

Tell me some of them wont you while we climb down to the car he
begged

My happiest one she said as they descended is the making of a
country home for little crippled children I think Ive found the
spotthe old Fairmount placeits not more than five miles from here
If I can only buy it at a reasonable figure

Mrs Lessing he broke in So thats the sort of thing that makes
your daydreams No wonderwell

Why should you be surprised Isnt that a delightful dream If I can
only make it come true

You can Do you want a visiting surgeon

Of course I do Will you

Why Mrs Lessing said he stopping short just below her on the steep
path and looking up into her face with eyes of eager pleasure thats
been one of my dreams so long I cant remember when I began to think
about it But I havent been able to finance it yet nor to find time
to get anybody else to do it If youll provide the place Ill do
everything I can to make it a success There are no less than four
children this minute Im longing to get into such a home Well go
into partnership if youll take me I whyyou see I cant even talk
straight about it And youI thought you were a society woman

I am a society woman I suppose she answered laughing though our
ideas might differ as to what that term stands for But why should that
prevent my caring for this lovely plan

Evidently it doesnt How many sides have you anyhow Ive found out
two new ones today Girland patron saint

Ah dont make fun of me Im no girl and very far from any kind of
saint Please help me down this fourfoot drop as if I were a very very
old lady for my head is dizzy with joy that Ive found somebody to care
for my schemes

He leaped down and held up his arms Come grandma he invited his
face full of mischief and enthusiasm and happiness

I think Ill play girl after all she refused gaily and accepting
one hand only swung herself lightly down to his side

And its bracers the fellows think they need to put the heart back
into them jeered Red Pepper Burns to himself Let them try the open
country and a comrade like thisif there is another anywhere on earth
But they cant have her




CHAPTER VII IN WHICH HE CONTINUES TO SAW WOOD

Here you are at last Red you sinner and Im the loser Ches and
Ive had a bet on since we saw the Green Imp tear off just as the first
guests were coming I vowed it was a fake call and youd never get back
till the musicians were greenflannelling their instruments

I knew he wouldnt do us a cutaway trick like that declared Arthur
Chester with an affectionate whitegloved hand on Burnss blackclad
arm Not that Id have blamed you on a night like this What people
want to give dances for in August with the thermometer at the top of
the tree I dont know

Go along in old man and see the ladies Take out Pauline Mrs
Lessing isnt dancing Make a sittingout engagement with the lovely
widow then bolt out here Thats my advice urged Macauley

Much obliged I will Wouldnt have come if Winifred hadnt cornered
me

Shes doing her duty by Pauline and she considers her duty isnt done
till shes secured the men Pauline wants But I saywhen you get a look
at Ellen youll forget the rivulets coursing down your neck Its the
first time shes worn anything not suggestive of past experiences Its
only white tonight but Macauleys pause was eloquent

Burns pushed on into the house through whose open doors and windows
came sounds of revelry A stringed orchestra was playing somewhere out
of sight and to its music the late arrival holding his head well up
that he might keep his collar intact until the latest possible moment
set his course toward his hostess

Outside in the bower which had been made of the porch Chester
disgracefully shuffling off the duties of host and lounging with
Macauley and two or three other of the young married men reported
through the flowerhung window the progress of the victim led to the
sacrifice

Hes shouldered his way to Winhes shaking hands and trying not to
look hot Hi Paulines sighted him already Shes making for him like
the arrow to the target

Or the bullet for the hippopotamus suggested Macauley under his
breath in Chesters ear He too began to reconnoiter

Hes asking her if she saved the first one for him and shes telling
him she did till the last minute Her card is full now but he shall
have the last half of this next one Doesnt he look overjoyed Chester
chuckled wickedly

Wheres Ellen Why isnt she on deck now just as Red comes Macauley
began to fume Shes behaved nobly all the evening so farshe might
have a rational being how for a partner as her reward But I presume
shes sitting out somewhere with that chump of a Wardlawhe follows her
like a shadow and shes too kindhearted to shake him Shes

A voice speaking softly from the lawn below the porch interrupted him
Is Doctor Burns urns here it asked

Chester went over to the rail Hes only just come you know Miss
Mathewson You dont have to call him out this minute do you

Im sorry Mr Chester but Im afraid I must The call is very
urgent

Tell em to get somebody else

Doctor Burns wouldnt like ittheyre special friends of his

Oh wellI suppose hell see the bright side of getting out of that
Turkish bath in there but I must say I wish I didnt have to pull
through this whole affair without his support grumbled Chester as he
went in to find Burns now disappeared into the inner rooms where the
music came from

Red Pepper came out looking the name more than usual for three rounds
of the floor had brought as it seemed to him every drop of blood
to his face and his hair clung damply to his brow He held a brief
colloquy with his office nurse

No way out Ill have to go Ches said he with illconcealed joy

But youll hustle Youll make one more try of it begged Chester
This thing wont break up early not with Pauline pushing it Youll be
back in time to be taken out and fed

Try to and Burns disappeared off the end of the porch

Lucky dog gloomed Macauley The calls five miles out on the road
to the city Id like to be in the Green Imp for the spin Redll make of
it By George I

He broke off suddenly gave a hasty look around and bolted off the end
of the porch into the semidarkness of the lawn He ran across behind the
houses to his own back porch procured a dustcoat from within and dashed
back regardless of the bodily heat he was generating As the Green Imp
backed out of the barn Macauley swung himself into the unoccupied seat

Burns also in dustcoat pulled on over his evening clothes grinned
cheerfully Deserter he queried

Youll be back within the hour wont you

Less than that probably The Imps running like a bird tonightshow
you her paces when we get out Hi there Whos that chasing us Well
of all theyou too Ches

Panting Chester flung himself upon the runningboard just as the car
turned out of the yard Had a hunt for my coatnearly lost you he
gasped

Burns stopped the car See here sonny he expostulated You happen
to be host you know I might be detained out there though I dont
expect it

Ill take the trolley back if you are replied Chester settling
himself I cant stand it to see you fellows cut away out of the
powwow and not go too Ill take my chances

So be it and laughing with a glance back at the gaily lighted
house Burns sent the car on her course You two are always bragging up
the married life he remarked as the Green Imp gathered speed but
it strikes me youre pretty eager to get away from the glories of your
wives entertaining

Its one curious thing admitted Macauley thoughtfully that no
matter how harmonious a couple may be theyre bound to differ on what
does and does not constitute entertainment

Of course a girl like Pauline always wants to dance no matter how
torrid the night explained Chester Win and I have to consider our
guests wish But you can bet Pauline isnt getting her wishnot with
R P Burns running around the country all the evening and only making
fiveminute stops at her side

By the speed with which the Green Imp swallowed the ground it looked as
if Burns might make several such trips and still interpolate a number
of fiveminute stops before the affair at the Chester house should
be over Before his passengers were well aware of the distance they
had covered he pulled up in front of a small cottage They settled
themselves comfortably to await a fifteenminute stay but in five he
was out again Both dust coat and clawhammer were offhis sleeves were
rolled to the elbow

Im in for it boys he said Cant get away under two hours at the
shortest Sorry But they didnt let me know what they wanted me for
and Im caught Youll have to drive home Call up Johnny Caruthers and
let him bring back the Imp and Miss Mathewson I cant be spared long
enough to go myself so take her this note to tell her what to bring
Get busy now

He handed Macauley a hasty scrawl on a prescription blank and smiled at
the discomfited faces of his two friends showing plainly in the lights
which streamed from the house

You look blamed pleased over your job growled Macauley

I like the job all right admitted Burns particularly when
contrasted with

You wouldnt say it if youd caught one glimpse of Mrs L called
back Chester as the Imp responded somewhat erratically to Macauleys
unaccustomed touch But all the answer they got was an emphatic Dont
change gears as if you were running a thrashing machine Mac

It was two hours and a half later that Burns came out of the small
cottage again wiping a damp face his white shirtfront a pathetic
ruin his hastily reassumed white waistcoat and tie decidedly the worse
for having been carelessly handled But his face when he turned it
toward the stars as he crossed the tiny patch of a flowerbordered yard
was a contented one

It pays up all the arrears when you can leave a chunk of happiness
behind you as big as that one he said to himself Johnny Caruthers had
gone home by trolley long ago and Miss Mathewson was to remain for
the night and return with the doctor when he came for his morning
aftervisit Burns sent the Green Imp off at a moderate pace musing as
he drove through the now moderated and refreshing air of two oclock in
the morning

Party must be about over by now think itll adjourn without seeing
any more of Red Pepper and his misused dress clothes he reflected
I suppose those dancing puppets think theyve had a good time but
it isnt in it with mine Bless the little woman shes happy over her
first boy Hes a winner too As for Tom I could have tipped him
over with a nod of the head when he was thanking me for leaving the
merrygoround to stand by It must feel pretty good to be the father of
a promising specimen like that Must beat the adopting business several
leagues And thats not saying that Bobby Burns isnt the best thing
that ever happened to R P

Philosophizing thus he presently sent the Green Imp at her quietest
pace in at the home driveway The Chester house was still brilliantly
illumined his own dark except for the dim light in the office andhe
discovered it as he rounded the turna sort of halfradiance coming
from the windows of his own room where Bob slept in the small bed
beside his own Burns gazed anxiously at this for it showed that
somebody had turned on the hooded electric He was accustomed to leave
the door open into his private office in which a light was always
burning and with this Bob had hitherto been satisfied

He must have waked up and called for Cynthia he decided Housing the
Imp he quietly crossed the lawn to the window avoiding any sound of
footsteps on the gravelled paths Both windows screened by wire and
awnings were wide open he could see with ease into the room for the
house was an old one and stood low Climbing wistaria vines wreathed
the windows and sheltered by these he found himself secure from
observation

For after the first look he became exceedingly anxious not to be
discovered He had come home in the stirred and gentle mood often
brought upon him by his part in such a scene as the one he had lately
left behind him In the first wave of joy swept by a birth into a home
whether humble or exalted the man who has been of service in the hour
of trial is often caught and lifted into a sympathetic pleasure which
lasts for some time after he has gone on to less satisfying work Burns
had often jeered gently at himself for being as he considered more
than ordinarily susceptible to a sort of odd tenderness of feeling under
such conditions and as he stared in at the scene before him he was
uneasily conscious that he could not have come upon it at a more
vulnerable moment

Bobby Burns was sitting straight up in bed his cheeks flushed his
eyelids reddened as if with prolonged crying but his small face radiant
with happiness as he regarded his companion his plump little fist
thrust tight into the hand which held his In a chair close beside him
sat a figure in silvery white bare beautifullymoulded arms from
which the gloves had been pulled and flung aside upon the bed gleaming
in the glow from the hooded light

Black head was close to black head her black lashes and his disclosed
dark eyes curiously alike in the distracting glance of them even the
colouring of the faces was similar for both showed the warm and peachy
hues laid there by the summer sun

They might easily be mother and son was the thought forced upon the
spectator His own cheek suddenly burned in the shadow of the wistaria
vines

He listened abstractedly to the conclusion of the story it must have
been a charming tale for the boys cry of regret when it ended was
eloquent But the eavesdropper heard with full appreciation the richness
of the low voice and could not wonder at Bobs delight in it He watched
with absorbed eyes the embrace exchanged between the two and forgetting
to be cautious allowed his shifted foot to crunch the gravel under the
window

Quicker than thought the light went out Burns made for the office door
consumed with eagerness to catch her before she could get away But
when he set foot upon the threshold of his room only the little figure
pulling itself again erect in the bed met his eyes in the dim light
issuing from the office and otherwise the room was empty

Nobody heard me cryin but her explained Bob to his questioning
guardian Cynthia was all goned away and I heard the fiddles and they
made me cry She comed in and told me stories I love her But she
wented awful quick out that way He pointed toward a French window
opening like a door upon the lawn I wish she didnt go so quick She
looked awful pretty all white and shiny She loves me I think dont
you

Of course old man Thats your particular good luckeh Now lie down
and go to sleep and tell me all about it in the morning

Arent you going back to the party queried Bob anxiously

Hardly Burns glanced humorously down at his attire But Im not
going to bed just yet so shut your eyes Ill not be far away

The child obeyed Exchanging the clawhammer for his office coat Burns
went out by way of the French window to the rear of the house

An hour afterward Arthur Chester putting out lights discovered from a
back window a familiar figure at a familiar occupation But at this hour
of the night the sight struck him as so extraordinary that curiosity
afire he hurriedly let himself out of the side door he had just locked
and crossed the lawn

In the name of all lunatics Red why sawing wood It cant be ill
temper at missing the show

In the August moonlight the figure straightened itself and laid down the
saw Go to bed and dont bother your addle pate about your neighbours
Cant a man cut up a few sticks without your coming to investigate

Saw a few more You havent got the full dose necessary yet advised
Chester his hands in his pockets Want me to sit up with you till you
work it all off

Its beginning to look as if it wouldnt work off muttered R P
Burns

Must be a worse attack than usual How long have you been at it

Dont know

Sawed that whole heap at the side there

Suppose so

Lost a patient

No

Blow out a tire

No

Bad news of any sort

No Go to bed

I feel I oughtnt to leave you persisted Chester Dont you think it
might ease your mind to tell me about it

Burns came at him with the saw and Chester fled Burns went back to
his woodpile marshalled the sawed sticks into orderly ranks then stood
still once more and once more looked up at the stars

If an hour of that on a night like this wont take the nonsense out of
me he solemnly explained to a bright particular planet now low in the
heavens I must be past help But Ill bedrawn and quartered if Ill
give in Havent I had knockouts enough to be able to keep my head this
time Red Pepper Burns Remember the Maine Now go to bed yourself




CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH HE IS UNREASONABLY PREOCCUPIED


Red Pepper Burns put down that stuff and come over Its nine oclock
and Pauline goes tomorrow as you very well know And not only Paul but
Mrs Lessing Pauls persuaded her to start when she does though she
wasnt expecting to go for three days longer

R P Burns looked up abstractedly Cant come now Im busy he
replied and immediately became reabsorbed in the big book he was
studying

Chester gazed at him amazedly He sat at the desk in the inner office
surrounded by books medical magazines foreign reviews in both French
and German as Chester discovered on approaching more closely by loose
anatomical plates by sheets of paper covered with rough sketches of
something it looked more like a snake in convulsions than anything else
Evidently Burns was deep in some sort of professional research

It was not that the sight was an unaccustomed one There could be no
question that R P Burns MD was a close student this was not the
first nor the fortieth time that his friend had thus discovered him
The view to be had from the point where Chester stood of the small
laboratory opening from this office was also a familiar one He could
see steam arising from the sterilizer he knew surgical instruments were
boiling merrily away there A table was littered with objects suggesting
careful examination a fine microscope in position a centrifuge Bunsen
burners testtubes elsewhere other apparatus of a description to make
the uninitiated actively sympathetic with the presumable coming victim

The point of the situation to Chester was that astonishing fact that
Burns could hear unmoved of the immediate departure of Ellen Lessing
He made up his mind that this scientific enthusiast could not have
assimilated the dreadful news he would try again

Red Do you hear Shes going tomorrowtomorrow

Let her go Dont bother me

I dont mean Pauline Ellens going too

Burns put up one sinewy hand and thrust it through his hair which
already stood on end His collar was off and he wore a laboratory apron
his appearance was not prepossessing He pulled a piece of paper toward
him and began to make rapid lines It was the snake again in worse
convulsions than before Evidently he had not heard Chester approached
the desk

Red he shouted The patient isnt on the table yet he wont die
if you listen to me one minute I want you to take this thing in Mrs
Lessing

Knocking the sketch to one side and precipitating three books and a mass
of papers to the floor Red stood up He towered above his shrinking
fiend wrath in his eye His lips moved If it had been three months
earlier Chester would have expected to hear language of a lurid
description As it was the first syllable or two did slip out but
no more followed Only speechgood vigorous Saxon not to be
misunderstood

Will you try to get it into your brain that I dont care a hang who
goes or where so long as I figure out a way to do this trick The other
fellows all say it cant be done Not one of emll do it not even Van
Horn I say it can and Im going to do it tomorrow morning at nine
oclock if I can work out a tool to do it with and make it And I can
do that if idiots like you will get out and keep out

He sat down and was instantly lost again in his effort at invention
Chester looked at him in silence for a minute more then he walked
quietly out Offended Not he He had not listened to invective from
that Celtic tongue for eight years not to know that high tension over a
coming critical operation almost invariably meant brilliant success
But even he had never seen Red Pepper keyed up quite so taut as this It
must be a tremendous risk he meant to take Success to himthe queer
fine old boy

He may be over later when he gets that confounded snake of an
instrument figured out Chester offered this to the group upon his
porch as consolation

And if he doesnt get it figured out before we break up he wont
be over prophesied Macauley Ten to one he forgets to come and say
goodbye before he starts for the hospital in the morning

Im going to be standing beside the driveway when he goes vowed
Pauline And if he doesnt notice me Ill climb on the car

Ellen dont go tomorrow whispered Martha Macauley to her sister
Dont let it end this way When he comes to youll be gone and thats
such a pity just now

But I think I would rather be gone dear Ellen Lessing whispered
back

Oh why When Reds excited over a big success hes simply off his
headtheres no knowing what he wont do

I prefer him when he has his head Dont urge Martha Ive promised to
go in the morning with Pauline and nothing could make me change

Its a shame for him to be so absorbed Who wants a man who can forget
the existence of a woman like that

Who wants one who cant A sorry surgeon hed behis hand would shake
Dont talk about it any more dear Im going to enjoy this evening with
you all And I hopeoh how I hopethat operation will be a success

If it were not to be a success it would not be the fault of the man who
worked till one oclocktwo oclockthree oclock it the morning to
perfect the strangely convoluted tool which was to help do the trick
if it could be done Part of the work was done in the laboratory part
in the machine shop which occupied a corner of the old red barn where
the Green Imp lent her lamps as aids to the task in hand At four the
instrument finished sterilized and put away as if it were worth its
weight in goldwhich it might easily have been if it were to prove
fitted to the peculiar needBurns went to bed At six he was up again
had a cold plunge and a hearty breakfast and at seven was sending the
Imp out of the gateway his office nurse beside him If Mrs Lessing
hoped the operation would be a success Miss Mathewson hoped and feared
and longed with all her soul Beneath the uniform and behind the quiet
plain face of the young woman who had been R P Burnss professional
assistant for eight years lived a person than whom none cared more how
things went with him But nobody knew that least of all Burns himself
He only knew that he could not get on without her that never a suture
that she had prepared made trouble for him after an operation and that
none other of the hundred nice details upon which the astounding results
of modern surgery depend was likely to go wrong if it were she who was
responsible

At five oclock that afternoon the Green Inn came back Arthur Chester
had just returned from the office and had thrown himself into a hammock
on the porch for the September weather was like that of June Catching
the throbbing purr of the Imp as the car swung in at the driveway
Chester jumped up Burns flung out a triumphant arm Miss Mathewson was
smiling

By George the old boys won out Chester said to himself and hurried
down to meet the Imp All over but the shouting Red he questioned
eagerly

All over Burnss face was aflame

Pull up and tell me about it

The car came to a standstill Nothing to tell The curve I got on that
bit of steel did the work around the corner and inside out The fellows
said it wouldnt stood around and croaked for an hour beforehand Lord
Id have died myself before Id have failed after that

Should have thought theyd have unsettled your nerve declared
Chester looking as if he would like personally to pitch into the entire
medical profession

Didnt Just made me mad I can do anything when Im madif I can
keep my mouth shut Burns laughed rather shamefacedly Thats the one
advantage of a temper I say Ches dont you want to go with me There
are probably half a dozen calls waiting at the office Ill run and
see

He jumped out seized his surgical handbags and hurried away Miss
Mathewson descended more deliberately Chester plying her with eager
questions as he assisted her How was it Pretty big feather in his
cap Miss Mathewson

Indeed it was Mr Chester Every one of the other city surgeons said
it couldnt be done without killing the patient They all admitted that
if she survived the operation she would have every chance for recovery
They were all there to see I never knew them all there at once before

It would be ungenerous to imagine they wanted him to fail chuckled
Chester but were all human How did they take it when he succeeded

They remembered they were gentlemen and scientists declared Miss
Mathewsonall but one or two who arent worth mentioning When they
saw he had done it they began to clap I dont believe there was ever
such a burst of applause in that surgery

What did the old fellow do Tried to look modest I suppose laughed
Chester glowing with pride and pleasure

He was white all through the operationhe always is with the strain
But he turned red all over when they cheered and just said Thank you
gentlemen It really was a wonderful thing Mr Chester even in these
days Only one man has done it a German and he has done it only twice
Doctor Burns will be distinguished after this

Good for him No wonder he looks the way he doesas if hed like to
turn a few handsprings Chester reflected as he watched the nurses
trim figure walk away

Burns came back Jump in he said Work enough to keep me busy till
bedtime If there hadnt been Id have proposed a beefsteak in the
woods by way of a celebration and a let down Im beginning to get a bit
of reaction of course should have liked an hour or two of jollity You
and Win and Mrs Lessing and I might have

Mrs Lessing You old chump dont you remember shes gone Why Mac
started for the train with them all in his car not ten minutes before
you came They havent been gone fifteen I begged off from going along
because I was dusty and tired Just got home myself

R P Burns making the circuit of the driveway behind the houses and
now turning the Imps nose toward the street again stared at his friend
in amazement

Why she wasnt going till day after tomorrow he exclaimed

I came over last night drawled Chester in a longsuffering tone and
explained to you and shouted at you and tried in every way to ram the
idea into your head that Pauline had wheedled Mrs Lessing to start when
she did because their routes lay together as far as Washington You put
me out calling me names and generally insulting me Its all right of
course Shes to spend the winter in South Carolina but shell be back
next summer You can say goodbye to her then Itll do just as well

Burnss watch was in his hand What time does that train go he
demanded

Fivethirty You cant make it Chesters watch was also out What
do you care Send her a picture postcard explaining that you forgot all
about her until it was too

The last word was jerked back into his throat by the jump of the Green
Imp She shot out of the driveway like a stone out of a catapult and
was off down the mile road to the station All conveyances going to that
train had passed quarterhour before and the course was nearly clear

Theres the trains smoke at the tunnel You cant do it asserted
Chester pointing to the black hole a few rods to one side of the
station whence a gray cloud was issuing She only makes a two minute
stop You wont more than get on board before

If I get on board you drive into the city and meet me there will you
begged Burns

I cant drive the Imp Red you know I cant

Then phone Johnny Caruthers from the station and send him in for me
Thatll give me fifteen minutes on the train

Whats the use Paulinell be at your elbow every minute Shell

But Burns was paying no attention He was taking the Imp past a
lumbering farmwagon with only two inches to spare between himself and
the ditch Then the car was at the station Burns was out and through
the building through the gate and upon the slowlymoving train after
a moments hasty argument with a conductor to whom he could show no
ticket On the platform James Macauley junior and Martha Macauley
Winifred Chester and four small children of assorted ages stared after
the big figure bolting into the Pullman Bobby Burns gave a shriek of
delight followed by a wail of disappointment

By George hes turned up after all exulted Macauley and the two
women looked at each other with meaning relieved glances

In the car the passengers observed interestedly the spectacle of a
large man with a mop of fiery red hair from which he had pulled a
leather cap striding dustcovered into the car and up to the two
prettiest young women there One of these very smartly clad in blue
received him with looks half gay half pouting and with a storm of
talk The other in gray with a face upon which no eye could rest once
without covertly or openly returning in deference to its charm gave him
a quiet hand and turned away again to wave her farewell to the group of
friends on the platform

Take my chair and Ill perch on the arm of Ellens commanded
Pauline while you explain apologize and try to make your peace with
us Youll find it hard work I may smile for the sake of appearances
but inside Im really awfully angry So is Ellen though she doesnt
show it

Thus Pauline indefinitely prolonged and repeated with variations
interpolations interruptions It didnt matter Redfield Pepper Burns
heard none of it Even with Pauline perching on the arm of Ellen
Lessings chair her face within eight inches of the other face she was
not within the field of his vision

I am sure the operation was successful said Mrs Lessing

One can see it in his eyes declared Pauline I never knew hazel eyes
could be so brilliant

It went through admitted Burns It had to you know And I had a
thing to make last evening

Arthur told us about it chattered Pauline It was like a sna

You didnt miss my not coming over said Burns He was leaning
forward his hands on his knees his rumpled head near enough so that
very low tones could reach the person to whom he spoke He did not once
look at Pauline One would have thought that that fact alone would have
quieted her but it did not

Indeed we didawfully cried Pauline

Neither did I myself then Mrs Lessing I miss it now I shall miss
it more whenever I think about it I dont know of but one thing that
can possibly make it up to me

Name it You dont deserve it but our hearts are rather tender and
we might grant Pauline looked arch But what was the use Nobody saw
Even the passengers were watching the one in gray Spectators always
watch the woman at whom the man is looking And in this case it seemed
well worth while for even the most admirable reserve of manner could
not control the telltale colour which was slowly mounting under the
direct and continued gaze of the man with the red hair The man himself
it occurred to more than one passenger was rather well worth study

Its always been a theory of mine that no woman can know a man until
shes exchanged letters with him for a considerable period of timesay
a winter Burns went on Pauline made some sort of an exclamation
but he failed to notice itNeither can a man know a woman Its a
stimulating experience Suppose we try it

How often do you propose to write to us inquired Pauline

Now at last Red Pepper Burns looked at her If she had known him
better she would have known that all his vows to keep his tongue from
certain words were at that moment very nearly as written in water But
the look he gave her stung her for an instant into silence

I shall want to hear about Bob Ellen replied all you can tell me
I have promised to write to him You will have to read the letters aloud
to himwhich will give you a very fair idea of what I am doing But if
you care for an extra sheet for yourselfnow and then

An extra sheet When I am in the mood I am likely to write a dozen
sheets to you When Im not a page will be all youll care to read
Will you agree to the most erratic correspondence you ever had with the
most erratic fellow

It sounds very promising she answered smiling

The train drew into the city station The stop was a short one for the
Limited was late In the rush of outgoing and incoming passengers
Burns managed for the space of sixty seconds to get out of range of
Paulines ears

I shall count the hours till I get that first letter said he

She looked up You surely dont expect a letter till you have sent
one

He laughed Im going home to begin to write it now he said

Pauline accompanied him to the vestibule where he shook hands with her
forgivingly From the platform he secured a last glimpse of the other
face which gave him a friendly smile as he saluted with his dusty
leather cap held out toward her at the length of his arm When he could
no longer see her he drew a gusty sigh and turned away

As he stood at the street entrance of the big station waiting for
Johnny Caruthers and the Green Imp this is what he was saying to
himself

Red youve made more than one woman unhappy to say nothing of
yourself by making love to her because she was a beauty and your head
swam This time youve tried rather hard to do her the justice to wait
till you know Only time and absence can settle that Remember you found
a nest of gray hairs in your red pate this morning That should show
that youre gaining wisdom at last the salt in the red pepper the
seasoning of time eh R P But by the rate of my pulse at this
present moment Im inclined to believeits going to be a bit hard to
write an absolutely sane letter Perhaps it would be safer if I knew
Pauline Pry would see it Ill try to write as if I knew she would
But by the spark I thought I saw in those black eyes I dont really
imagine Pauline will




CHAPTER IX IN WHICH HE SUFFERS A DEFEAT


The hands of the office clock were pointing to half after two on a
certain September night when Burns came into his office alone The
fire in the office fireplace kept bright until nearly midnight when
his housekeeper had given up waiting for him and gone to bed had burned
to a few smouldering lumps of cannelslag A big leather easychair
its arms worn with much use had been pulled into an inviting position
before the fireplace and the nightlight by the desk was burning as
usual All that could be expected had been done by the kindhearted
Cynthia who comprehended by signs she knew well and had been watching
for several days that affairs were going wrong with her employer

But he needed more than could be given him by things inanimateneeded
it woefully He came in as a man comes who is not only physically weary
to the point of exhaustion but heart sick and sore besides He dropped
his heavy surgical bags upon the floor by the desk as if he wanted never
to take them up again pulled off coat and cap and let them fall where
they would then stumbled blindly over to the big chair and sank into it
with a great sigh as if he had reached the end of all endeavour

If it had been physical fatigue alone which had brought him to this pass
he might have dropped asleep where he sat and waked after an hour or
two to drag himself away to bed like one who had been drugged For a
short space indeed he lay motionless in the chair in the attitude of
one so spent for sleep that he must needs find it in the first place his
body touches But there are times when the mind will not let the body
rest And this was one of them

The scene he had left lately was burning before his tired eyes the
sounds he had lately heard were beating in his brain For a week he had
been putting every power he possessed into the attaining of an end for
which it had more than once seemed to him that he would be willing to
sacrifice his own life He had dared everything fought every one had
his own way in spite of every obstacle believing to the last that he
could win as he had so often won before by sheer contempt of danger
But this time he had failed

That was all there was of ithe had failed failed so absolutely so
humiliatingly so publiclythis was the way he put it to himselfthat
he was in disgrace He had operated when others advised against
operation and had seemed to succeed brilliantly and incredibly Then
the case had begun to go wrong He had operated a second timeagainst
all precedent taking tremendous risksand had lost

But this was not the worst He had lost cases before and had suffered
keenly over them but not as he was suffering now In a world of death
some cases must be lost even by the most successful of all of his
profession But this was an unusual case This wasO God how could he
bear losing this one

He had known her from a little girl of eight till now when at sixteen
bright beautiful winsome sixteen he had what had he done She
might have had a chance for lifewithout operation He had taken that
chance away And she had trusted himhow she had trusted him Ah there
was the bitter drop in the cup the turn of the knife in the raw wound
When the others had opposed she had looked up at him with that smile
of hershow could she smile when she was in such painand whispered
Please do whatever you want to Doctor Burns And he had answered
confidently Good for you Lucileif only theyd all trust me like
that Id show them what I could do

Vain boastwild boast He had been a fooltwice a foolthrice a
fool He was a fool clear throughthat was the matter with hima proud
fool who had thought that with a thrust of his keenedged tools he
could turn Death himself aside

And when he had tried his hand a second time in the last futile effort
to avert the impending disaster she had trusted him just the same When
he had said to her speaking close to her dull ear Dear little girl
Im going to ask you to go to sleep again for me she had turned
her head upon the pillow that tortured young headhe would not have
thought she could move it at alland had smiled at him again for the
last time He would remember that smile while he lived

He got up from his chair as the intolerable memory smote him again as
it had been smiting him these three hours since the end had come He
began to pace the floor back and forth back and forth There were those
who said that R P Burns threw off his cases easily did not worry
about them did not take it to heart when they went wrong It is a thing
often said of the men who must turn from one patient to another and
show to the second no hint of how the first may be faring Those who say
it do not knowcan never know

The hours wore on Burns could not sleep could not even relax and rest
To the first agony of disappointment succeeded a depression so profound
that it seemed to him he could never rise above it and take up his work
again A hundred times he went painfully over the details of the case
from first to last Why had he done as he had Why had he not listened
to Grayson to Van Horn to Fields Only Butler had backed him up in his
decisionsand he knew well enough that Butler had done it only because
of his faith in Burns himself and his remembrance of some of his
extraordinary successes not because his own judgment approved

Five oclocksix oclockhe had thrown himself into the chair again
and had at last dropped into an uneasy sort of half slumber when the
office door quietly opened and Miss Mathewson came in It was two hours
before she was due Burns roused and regarded her wonderingly with eyes
heavy and bloodshot She stood still and looked down at him sympathy
in her face She herself was pale with fatigue and loss of sleep for
she had been with him throughout the week of struggle over the case
he had lost and she knew the situation as no one else even his
professional colleagues knew it But she smiled wanly down at him like
a pitying angel

You didnt go to bed Doctor she said very gently I was afraid you
wouldnt Wont you go now You know theres a days work before you

He shook his head NoId rather get out in the air Im going now
Id like to take the Imp anddrive to

No noShe spoke quickly coming closer as if she understood and
would not let him use the reckless common phrase which sometimes means
despair I thought you might be feeling like thatthats why I came
early Not that I can say anything to cheer you Doctor BurnsI know
you care too much for that But theres one thing you must realizeyou
must say it over and over to yourselfyou did your best No human being
can do more

A fools best he muttered Cold comfort that

Not a fools besta skilful surgeons best

He shook his head again got slowly up from his chair and stood
staring down into the ashes of the longdead fire The usually straight
shoulders were bent the naturally wellpoised head always carried
confidently erect was sunk upon the broad chest

Amy Mathewson watched him for a minute her own face full of pain then
laid her hand rather timidly upon his arm He looked round at her
and tried to smile but the effort only made his expression the more
pitiful

Bless your heart said he brokenly I believe youd stand by me to
the last ditch of a failure

Her eyes suddenly filled Id let you operateon my mothertoday
said she in a low voice

He gazed into her working face for a long moment seized her hand and
wrung it hard then strode away into the inner office and flung the door
shut behind him

A halfhour later he came out He had himself sternly in hand again His
shoulders were squared his head up in his face was written a peculiar
grim defiance which those who did not comprehend might easily mistake
for the stoicism imputed to men of his calling under defeat Miss
Mathewson knew better understood that it was taking all his courage
to face his work again and realized as nobody else could that the day
before him would be one of the hardest he had yet had to live But
she was hopeful that little by little he would come back to the same
recognition of that which she felt was really true that in spite of
the results he had been justified in the risk he had taken and that he
could not be blamed that conditions which only a superhuman penetration
could have foreseen would arise to thwart him

Cynthia has your breakfast ready for you Doctor Miss Mathewson said
quietly as he came out She did not look up from the desk where
she was working on accounts But as he passed her on his way to the
diningroom he laid his hand for an instant on her shoulder and when
she looked up she met his grateful eyes She had given him the greatest
proof of confidence in her power and it had been the one ray of light
in his black hour

Wont you take just a taste o the chops Doctor urged his
housekeeper anxiously She knew nothing of the situation but she had
not served him for eight years not to have learned something of his
moods and it was clear to her that he had had little sleep for many
nights

But he put aside the plate I know theyre fine Cynthia said he in
his gentlest way But the coffees all I want this morning Another
cup please

Cynthia hesitated a motherly sort of solicitude in her homely face
Doctor do you know youve had four aready And its awful strong

Have I Wellperhaps thats enough Thank you Cynthia

His housekeeper looked after him as he left the room Hes terrible
blue to be so polite as that she reflected When hes happy hes in
such a hurry he dont have time to thank a body Of the two I guess Id
rather have him hustlin rude

In the middle of the day Burns met Van Horn

Sorry the case went wrong Doctor said his colleague There was a
peculiar sparkle in his eye as he offered this customary perfunctory
condolence

Thank you replied Burns shortly

I didnt wish to seem skeptical and you certainly have had remarkable
success in somewhat similar cases But it seemed to me that in advising
as I did I was holding the only safe ground Personally Im not in
favour of taking chances and in this case it seemed to me they were
pretty slim

They were

I did my best to assure the family that you were within your rights

Much obliged

I dont blame you for feeling broken up about it declared the
other man soothingly But we all have to learn by experience and
conservatism is one of the hardest lessons

An ugly light was growing in Red Peppers eye He got away without
further words Only last week Van Horn had been helped out of a serious
and baffling complication by Burns himself and no credit given to the
rescuer From him this sort of high and mighty sympathy was particularly
hard to bear

Around the corner he encountered Grayson This as it was so little to
be desired was naturally to be expected

Too bad Doctor Grayson began stopping to shake hands Van Horn had
not even shaken hands I hoped till the last that we were all wrong and
you were right But that heart seemed dangerously shaky to me though I
know you didnt think so

I didnt

There was a queer factor in the case one I felt from the first though
I couldnt put my finger on it It was the thing that made me advise
against operation

I understand

But of course theres no use crying over spilt milk you did your
best continued Grayson cheerfully Pretty little girlplucky too
Sorry to see her go

Burns noddedand bolted These Jobs comforterswere they trying to
make the thing seem even more unbearable than it already was Certainly
they were succeeding admirably He went on about his work with
set teeth expecting at the next turn to run into Fields He would
undoubtedly find him at the hospital ready to greet him with some
croaking sympathy True to his expectations Fields met him at the door
He himself was looking particularly prosperous and cheerful as people
have a way of appearing to us when our trouble is root theirs

Good morning Doctor Fields shook hands evidently trying to modify
his own demeanour of unusual good cheer over a list of patients all
safely on the road to ultimate recovery I want to express my regret
over the way things came out last night Mighty pretty operationif it
had succeeded Sorry it didnt Better luck next time

Much obliged Burns had a bulldog expression now Not the most
discerning observer would have imagined he felt a twinge of regret over
his failure

Would you mind telling me what made you so confident that the
spleen had nothing to do with the complication Fields inquired in a
deprecatory manner which made Burns long to twist his neck

Did you suggest that it didbeforehand

I believe I didif I remember

I believe you didntnor any other man till I got in and found it
You all observed it thenand so did I Excuse meIm in too much of a
hurry to stop to discuss the case now Im due upstairs And once more
Burns made good his escape

Sore was Fields verdict looking after the man who had been his
successful rival for so long that this exception could hardly fail
to afford a decided if rather shamefaced satisfaction to a brother
surgeon not above that quite human sentiment

But in the course of the day Burns met Buller He had dreaded to meet
him but not for the same reason that he had dreaded the others Meeting
Buller was quite another story

Old boy Im so sorry I could cry if it would do you any good said
Buller his steady honest gaze meeting his friends miserable eyes
For the defiance had melted out of Burnss aspect and left it frankly
wretched before the hearty friendship in this mans whole attitude
friendship which could be counted upon like that of his office nurses
to the end of all things

Burns swallowed hard making no reply because he could not But his
hand returned the steady pressure of Butlers in a way that showed he
was grateful

I knew youd take it hardmuch harder than common And of course I
understand why Any man would But I wish I could make you feel the
way I do about it Theres not one particle of reason for you to blame
yourself Ive thought the case over and over from start to finish and
Im more and more convinced that she wouldnt have lived without the
operation You gave her her only chance Take that in I mean it I went
around there this morning and told the family soI took that liberty
It was a comfort to them though they believed anyway They havent lost
a particle of faith in you

Burns bit his lip till he had it under control and could get out a word
or two of gratitude

And now I want a favour of you the other went on hurriedly A case I
want you to see with mepossible operation within a day or two

Burns hesitated an instant changing colour Then Are you sure youd
better have me he asked a trifle huskily

The other looked him in the eye Why not I know of nobody so
competent Come man put that Satan of unreasonable selfreproach behind
you When man becomes omniscient and omnipotent therell be no errors in
his judgment or his performanceand not before Meanwhile were all in
the soup of fallibility together IIm not much at expressing myself
elegantly but I trust Im sufficiently forcible smiled Buller
Erwill you meet me at four at my office Well go to the Arnolds
together and Ill give you the history of the case on the way Its a
corker I assure you and its keeping me awake nights

Proceeding on his way alone in the Imp he had not wanted even Johnny
Carutherss company today Burns found the heaviness of his spirit
lifting slightly very slightly Tenderness toward the little lost
patient who had loved and trusted him so well began gradually to
usurp the place of the black hatred of what he felt to be his own
incompetency Passing a florists shop he suddenly felt like giving that
which as it had occurred to him before had seemed to him would be only
a mockery from his hands He went in and selected flowersdozens and
dozens of white rosebuds fresh and sweetand sent them with no card
at all to her home

Then he drove on to his next patient to find himself surrounded by an
eager group of happy people all rejoicing in what appeared to them to
be a marvelous deliverance from a great impending danger entirely due
to his own foresight and skill He knew well enough that it way Nature
herself who had come to the rescue and frankly told them so But they
continued to thrust the honour upon him and he could but come away with
a softened heart

Ill go on again he said to himself Ive got to go on Last night I
thought I couldnt but of course thats nonsense The best I can God
knows I try And Ill never make that mistake again But ohlittle

CHAPTER X IN WHICH HE PROVES HIMSELF A HOST


Winifred said R P Burns invading Mrs Arthur Chesters sunny
livingroom one crisp October morning leather cap in hand Im going
to give a dinner tonight Stag dinner for Grant of Edinburghman who
taught me half the most efficient surgery I know Hes over here and
Ive just found it out Only been in the city two days goes tomorrow

How interesting Red Where do you give it At one of the clubs or
hotels in town

Thats the usual thing of course Thats why Im not going to do it
Grants a rugged sort of commonsense chaphates show and fuss He gets
an overpowering lot of being entertained in precisely the conventional
style Hes a pretty big gun now and he cant escape When I told him
I was going to have him out for a plain dinner at home he looked as
relieved as if Id offered him a reprieve for some sentence

Undoubtedly hell enjoy the relaxation Hut youll have a caterer out
from town I suppose

Not on your life Cynthia can cook well enough for me and I know
Ronald Grants tastes like a book But what I want to ask is that
you and Martha Macauley will come over and see that the table looks
shipshape Cynthias a captain of the kitchen but her ideas of table
decoration are a trifle too original even for me Miss Mathewsons away
on her vacation Ill send in some flowers My silver and china are
nothing remarkable bur as long as the foods right that doesnt
matter

I shall be delighted to do it for you Red as you know So will
Martha We

Thanks immensely I want Ches of course and Jim Macauleys coming The
rest are M Ds I must be off

He would have been off without doubt in an instant more for he was
half out of the door as he spoke but Winifred Chester flew after him
and laid an insistent hand on his coat sleeve

Red You must stop long enough to tell me something about it How can I
help you unless I know your plans What hour have you set How many
are coming and who How many courses are you going to have Have you
engaged a waitress

Red Pepper looked bewildered Is there all that to it he inquired
helplessly How in thunderI beg your pardonhow do I know how many
courses therell be Ask Cynthia that The hours seventhirty cant
get around earlier even if I wanted to be less formal Theres Van Horn
and Buller and Fields and Grayson and Grant and Ches and Jim andand
myself I may have asked somebody else seems as if did but I cant
remember Youd better put on an extra plate in case I have

He was starting off again but Winifred laughing helplessly again
detained him Red youre too absurd What about the waitress Shall I
find one for you

I supposed Cynthia could serve us she always does me

She cant tonight and prepare things to send in too

Oh well see to it if youll be so kind only let me go for Ive only
fifteen minutes now to meet a consultant ten miles away Goodbye Win

He took time to turn and smile at her and for the sake of the
smileshe knew of none other just like itshe forgave him for
involving her in the labours she already clearly foresaw were to be
hers How precisely like Red Pepper Burns it was to plan for a stag
dinner in this inconsequent way If it had been a coming operation now
no detail of preparation would have been too insignificant to command
his attention But in the present instance unquestionably all he had
done was to appear at the door of the kitchen and casually inform
Cynthia that eight or nine men were coming to dinner tonight and
hed trust her to see that they should have something good to eat Poor
Cynthia

Winifred ran over to consult Martha Macauley and together they braved
Burnss housekeeper in her kitchen The result was relief as far as
the dinner itself was concerned Cynthia was a superior cook and long
experience with exclusively masculine tastes had taught her the sort of
thing which however out of the beaten line for entertaining was likely
to prove successful in pleasing eight or nine men wherever they might
hail from

Cynthias planned a dinner that will be about as different from
Laziers concoctions as could be imagined Winifred said to Martha
but it will taste what Ches calls licking good Now for the table
Im afraid Reds china and linen are none too fine Well have to help
him out there

They helped him out Only the finest of Marthas linen and silver the
thinnest of Winifreds plates and cups and the most precious of her
glass would content them When the table was set in the lowceiled
casementwindowed old diningroom where Red Pepper was accustomed to
bolt his meals alone when he took time for them at all it was a to
table to suggest arrogantly the hand of woman Winifred eyed it with
milled satisfaction and concern

It looks lovely Martha but not a bit bachelorlike Do you suppose
hell mind

Not as long as the food is right and judging by the heavenly smells
from the kitchen theres no fear for that But its five oclock
and the flowers he promised you havent come Do you suppose hes
forgotten

Of course he has If he remembers the dinner itself itll be all we can
expect of him It doesnt matter There are heaps of pink and crimson
asters yet in the garden and some fall anemones Well arrange them
and then if his flowers do come well change But they wont

They didnt But the pink and crimson asters furnished a centrepiece
decidedly more in keeping somehow with a mens dinner than roses
would have been and the decorators were content with them Dora Mrs
Macauleys own serving maid who was to take the part of the waitress
Red Pepper had not thought necessary said they looked awful tasty
now

Its after seven and Red hasnt come yet Winifred Chester rushed at
Arthur dressing placidly Jim went in for the men with his car and
said hed surely have them here by seventwenty Youll have to go over
and do the honours for him till he comes Hell have to dress after he
gets here

He wont stop to dressnot if hes late predicted Chester
obediently hastening Hell rush in at the last minute smelling
horribly of antiseptics and set everybody laughing with some story
They wont care what he wears Its always a case of where MacGregor
sits theres the head of the table you know with Red I certainly
hope nothing will make him late Im not up to playing host to a lot of
physicians and surgeons I should feel as if I were about to be operated
on

Nonsense dear theres no jollier company when theyre off duty But
Red isnt here yet and Im sure I hear Jims Gabriel down the road Do
hurry

Chester ran across the back lawn and in through Burnss kitchen
startling Cynthia so that she nearly dropped the saltbox into a sauce
she was making for the beefsteak He reached the little front porch just
in time to welcome the batch of professional gentlemen who came talking
and laughing up the path together

Doctor Burns has been detained but Im sure hell be here soon
Chester explained shaking hands and discovering for himself which was
the famous Scottish surgeon by the rugged commonsense look of the man
quite as R P Burns had characterized him

Seventhirtyno Red Pepper Sevenfortyfiveeight oclockstill no
sign of him harder to be explained no sign from him Why didnt he
telephone or send a telegram or a messenger Waiting longer would not
do Cynthia in the kitchen was becoming unnervingly agitated

The dinner was served Chester at one end of the table Macauley at the
other both feeling a terrible responsibility upon them did their best
There had turned out to be two extra guests instead of the one whom
Burns had thought he might have asked but couldnt be sure and Winifred
had had a bad ten minutes looking out a full set of everything with
which to set his place For Red Peppers place must certainly be left
unfilled it would be beyond the possibilities that the dinner should
end without him

I believe he has forgotten whispered Martha to Winifred in the
office from whose dim shadows they were surreptitiously peering into
the dining room to make sure that everything was going properly

Oh he couldnt not with the Edinburgh man here Hes often told us
about Doctor Grant and how much he owes him He does look splendid and
capable doesnt hefor all hes so burly and homely And the other
men all feel honoured to be here with him even Doctor Van Horn whos
always so impressed with himself

They seem to be having a good time And theyre eating as if they never
saw food before Its a successas much as it can be without the host
himself Oh why doesnt Red come

He wouldnt desert a patient in a crisis for a dozen dinners

No but hed send word

Look at Arthur Hes hobnobbing with Doctor Grant as if hed always
known him

Jim is having a bad time with Doctor Van Horn I can see it in his eye
Mercy one of them looked this way Im afraid he saw me Come

The next time they reconnoitred the dinner was working toward its end
It was time for it was nearly ten oclock and Cynthias courses though
not many had been mighty Presently the table had been cleared and
the men were drinking coffee and lighting the excellent cigars which had
been Macauleys thought when he found that Red Pepper was not on hand to
provide them himself

Under the influence of these genial stimulantsBurns never offered any
others and one man who knew it had declined to comethe sociability
grew more positive Chester relaxed his legs under the table feeling
that at last Reds guests could take care of themselves Grayson proved
an accomplished storyteller Buller had lately had some remarkable
adventures even Ronald Grant who had seemed a trifle taciturn related
an extraordinary experience of another man The Scottish surgeon had the
reputation of never talking about himself

The smoke grew thick Macauleys cigars were of a strong brand the
air was blue with their reek Still the guests sat about the table and
still the talk went on

It was interrupted quite suddenly by the advent of Red Pepper Burns
himself Macauley saw him first standing in the doorway between dining
room and office but for an instant he did not know him Macauleys
startled look caught Chesters attention he sprang to his feet At the
same moment the Scottish surgeon following Chesters eyes observed the
figure in the door He was first to reach it

Whats happened ye lad he asked and acted without waiting for an
answer He threw a powerful arm about Burnss shoulders and led him
reeling back into the office where the air was purer

They crowded round doctors though they were and had many times sharply
ordered other people not to crowd They could see at a glance that Burns
was very faint that his right arm hung helpless at his side that his
forehead wore a blackening bruise and that his clothes were torn and
covered with dirt For the rest they had to wait

Grant took charge of his friendthe pupil whom he had never forgotten
The arm was badly broken too badly to be set without an anaesthetic In
the inner office Van Horn his dress coat off gave the chloroform
while the Scotchman set the arm and the American surgeons no longer
crowding but standing off respectfully as if at a clinic looked on
critically It was rapid and deft work they admitted especially since
the surgeon was using another mans splints and the patient proved to
be one of the subjects who fight the anesthetic from beginning to end

Chester whitefaced but plucky stuck it out but Macauley fled to
the outer air Seeing a familiar long dark form half on half off the
driveway he hurried toward it A minute later he had all the unoccupied
guests around him on the lawn and one of the Green Imps lamps was
turned upon its crippled shape

By George hes had a bad accident one and another of them said
as they examined the cars injuries The hood was jammed until they
wondered why the engine was not disabled the left runningboard was
nearly torn off and the fender a shapeless wreck The green paint was
scraped and splintered along the left side

He must have come home by himself How far do you suppose

Not far driving with his left hand and faint

He probably wasnt faint till he struck the indoor heat and the tobacco
smoke

Hes come at least five miles Look at that red clay on her sides
Theres no red clay like that around here except in one placeat
the old mill on the Red Bank road Chester demonstrated his
theory excitedly I ought to know Ive ridden with him on every
outoftheway bypath in the county first any last Theres a fright
of a hill just there

Five miles with that arm Gee This was Buller

Plucky was Graysons comment and there was a general agreement among
the men standing round

Macauley put his shoulder to the Imp Lets push her in fellows he
proposed He had forgotten that they were medical gentlemen of position
I dont seem to want to drive her just now he explained

They pushed the Imp to the red barn and shut it in with its injuries
Then they went back to the house where presently Burns came out from
under his anaesthetic and lay looking at his guests from under the
bandage which swathed his head

Im mighty sorry to have broken up the fun this way gentlemen he
said with a pale sort of smile Grayson was telling a story when I
butted in I think Finish it will you Grayson

Not much Yours is the story we want now if youre up to telling it
What happened out there on the Red Bank road

Burns scanned him How do you know what road

Your friend Mr Chesters detective instincts He says theres no other
red clay like that that plasters your car By the way thats a fast
machine of yours Did you lose control on the hill

Thats it acknowledged Burns simply I lost control

Chester was staring at him It was not in the nature of reason to
suppose that Red Pepper had lost control of that car unless something
else had happened first The steering gear of the Imp was certainly in
perfect condition Macauley had said so He wondered if Red meant that
he had lost his temper But what could make him lose his temperon Red
Bank hill

They questioned him closely all of them in turn But that was all he
would say He had lost control of the car One or two of the men who
knew Burns least looked as if they could tell what was the probable
cause of such loss of control Chester wanted to knock them down as
he fancied he recognized this attitude of mind And at last they
went awaywhich was certainly the best thing they could do in the
circumstances

All but Ronald Grant The Scottish surgeon accepted without hesitation
Burnss suggestion that Doctor Grant should stay and keep him company
for an hour or two while he got used to his arm and should then sleep
under his roof So they settled down Burns on his couch Grant in an
armchair When Chester left he was thinking that except for the outward
signs of his adventure Burns did not look as unfit as might have been
expected for a happy hour with an old friend

Just outside the house Chester himself had an adventure He was quite
alone and he almost ran into a slim figure on the walk The lights from
the office shone out into the October night and Chester could see at a
glance who the girl was even if the gleam of golden hair which all
the town knew had not told him She was panting and her hand was on her
side

Did Doctor Burns get home all right she cried under her breath

What do you know about Doctor Burns was Chesters quick reply He was
startled by the girls appearance here at this hour

It doesnt make any difference what I know Tell me if he got home Was
he much hurt Why shouldnt you tell me that Mr Chester

He is home and all right Do you want him professionally He cant go
out tonight

I know he cant But I had to know he got home I

She sank down on the doorstep shaken and sobbing Chester stood looking
down at het wondering what on earth he was to say What had Rose Seeley
to do with Red What had she to do with his losing control on the Red
Bank hill A quick thought crossed his mind to be as quickly dismissed
No whatever Reds private affairs were they could have nothing to do
with this Rosetoo bruised and trampled a rose to take the fancy of a
man like him even in his most evil hour

Suddenly she lifted her head He saved my life and most lost his
Theyd been making repairs on the hill and some way the lanterns
wasnt lit Its an awful dark night He saw what he was comin to and
turned out sudden into the grass He had to go into the ditch then not
to run over meand somebody else He ran away Plainly that scornful
accent did not mean Burns I didnt I helped him get the car up I
got his engine goin for him he showed me how His arm was broke There
aint no house for a mile out there I hated to see him try to come
home alone Ive walked all the wayrun some of itto make sure he got
here

He got here murmured Chester thinking to himself that this was the
queerest story hed over heard but confident he would never have any
better version of it and pretty sure that it was the true one

I suppose Im a crazy fool to tell you Mr Chester said the girl
thickly But youre a gentleman You wont tell No more will he He
didnt tell you how it happened did he

She did not ask the question She made the assertion looking to him for
confirmation Chester gave it No he didnt tell he said gravely

When she had gone he crossed the lawn to his own home musing For a
plain quiet dinner said he quoting a phrase of Burnss used
when he gave Chester the invitation I think Reds has been about as
spectacular as they make em Bully old boys




CHAPTER XI IN WHICH HE GETS EVEN WITH HIMSELF


R P Burns sat at his desk in the inner office laboriously inscribing
a letter with his left hand It did not get on well The handwriting
in the four lines he had succeeded in fixing upon paper bore not the
slightest resemblance to his usual style instead it looked like the
chirography of a fiveyearold attempting for the first time to copy
from some older persons script

He held up the sheet and gazed at it in disgust Then he glanced
resentfully at his slingsupported right arm especially at the fingers
which protruded from the bandages in unaccustomed limp whiteness Then
he shook his left fist at it Youll do some work the minute you
come out of those splints he said Youll work your passage back to
fitness quicker than an arm ever did before you palefaced shirk

Then he applied himself to his task painfully forming a series of
pothooks until one more sentence was completed He read it over then
suddenly crumpled the sheet into a ball and dropped it into the waste
basket

Lie there he whimsically commanded it Youre not fit to go to a
lady

He got up and marched into the outer office where his office nurse sat
at a typewriter making lout bills

Miss Mathewson he requested gruffly please take a dictation No
not on the bill letterheadson the regular office sheets Ill speak
slowly In fact Ill probably speak very slowly

Im sorry I dont know shorthand said Miss Mathewson preparing her
paper

Im not Instead Id rather youd be as slow as you can to give me
time to think Im not used to transmitting mediumsthe battery may be
weakin fact Im pretty sure it is All ready My dear Mrs Lessing

His cheek reddened suddenly as he saw the nurses waiting hands poised
over the keys when she had written this address He cleared his throat
and plunged in

This has been a typical November day dull and cold We had fine
October weather clear into the second week of this month but all at
once it turned cold and dull The leaves are all off the treesHold
ondont say that She knows the leaves are all off the trees the middle of
November

I have it partly written

Oh Well go on then Ill fix it a fact it may be necessary to
remind you of down there in South Carolina whereMiss Mathewson do
you suppose the leaves are on in South Carolina

I really dont know Doctor Burns I have always lived in the North

So have Ibother it Well leave that out

But Ive written a fact it may be necessary

Well finish it a fact at may be necessary to remind you of you have
been gone so long Oh hang itthat sounds flat How can I tell how
a sentence is coming out this way Let that paragraph stand by
itselfwell hasten on to something that will take the readers mind
off our unfortunate beginning

You will be glad to know that Bobby Burns is well and not only well
but fat and hearty He had a wrestling bout with Harold Macauley the
other day and downed him He got a black eye but that didnt count
though you may not like to hear of it He is heavier than when you saw
himOh Ive said that Miss Mathewson when you see Im repeating
myself hold me up

I cant always tell when youre going to repeat yourself Miss
Mathewson objected

Thats enough about Bob anyhow Mrs Macauley writes her all about him
every week only she probably didnt mention the black eye Well lets
start a new paragraph When in doubt always start a new paragraph It
may turn out a gold mine

I found my work much crippled by the loss of my arm Good Heavens that
sounds as if Id had it amputated And I suppose she naturally would
infer that a man cant do as much with his arm in a sling as he can
when its in commission Well let it stand I didnt realize how much
surgery I was doing till I had to cut it all out Cut it out that
certainly has a surgical ring It sounds rather bragging too Im
afraid Never mind The worst of it is to feel the muscles atrophying
from disuse and the tissues wasting so that when it comes out of the
splints it will still have to be cured of the degeneration the splints
haveOh hold on Miss Mathewsonthis sounds like a paper for a
surgical journal

Burns who had been walking up and down the room cast himself into an
armchair and stared despairingly at his amanuensis But she reassured
him by saying quietly that it was always difficult to dictate when one
was not used to it and that the letter sounded quite right

Well if you think so well try another paragraphthats certainly
enough about me Let me see He ran his left hand through his hair

Footsteps sounded upon the porch Arthur Chester opened the door

Oh excuse me Red Its nothing I was going for a tramp and I
thought

Im with you Burns sprang to his feet looking immensely relieved
Thank you Miss Mathewson well finish another time Or perhaps I can
scrawl a finish with my left hand Ill take the letter Ill look in at
Bob and get my hat in a jiffy Ches

He seized the letter ran into the inner office looked in at the
dimlylighted room where the boy was sleeping took up a soft hat and
out of sight of Miss Mathewson crammed the typewritten sheet into his
pocket in a crumpled condition Pulling the soft hat well down over his
eyes he followed Chester out into the fresh November night drawing a
long breath of satisfaction as the chill wind struck him

You were just in time to save me from an awful scrape Id got myself
into he remarked as they tramped away

I thought you looked hot and unhappy Were you proposing to Miss
Mathewson by letter Its always best to say those things right out
letters are liable to misinterpretation jeered Chester

Youre right there I was riding for a fall fast enough when you reined
up alongside But whats a fellow to do when he cant write himself
except in flytracks

I presume the lady would prefer the flytrack to a typewritten document
executed by another woman

How do you know the thing was to a lady Burns demanded

Thats easy No man looks as upset as you did over a communication to
another man What do you write to her for anyhow when shes as near as
Washington

What

Doesnt she keep you informed Winifred says Martha says Ellen came
back up to Washington yesterday for the wedding of a friendhastily
arrangedto an army officer suddenly ordered somewhereold friend of
Ellensformer bridesmaid of hers I believe She

Burns had stopped short in the middle of the hubbly halffrozen street
they were crossing How long does she stay in Washington

I dont know Ask Win Probably not long since she only came for this
wedding Its tonight I think she said Arent you coming

Burns walked on at a rapid stride with which Chester shorterlegged and
narrowerchested found it difficult to keep up They had their tramp a
fourmile course which they were accustomed to cover frequently together
at varying paces Chester thought they had never covered it quite so
quickly nor so silently before For Burns from the moment of receiving
Chesters news appeared to fall into a reverie from which it was
impossible to draw him and the subject of which his companion found it
not difficult to guess After the first half mile Chester than whom
few men were more adaptable to a friends mood accepted the situation
and paced along as silently as Burns until the round was made and the
two were at Burnss door

Good night Afraid Ive been dumb as an oyster was Burnss curt
farewell and Chester chuckled as he walked away

Somethingll come of the dumbness he prophesied to himself

Something did It was a telegram telephoned to the office by a sender
who rejoiced that having ones left arm in a sling did not obstruct
ones capacity to send pregnant messages by wire He had obtained the
address from Martha Macauley also over the telephone

Mrs E F Lessing Washington D C Am leaving Washington tonight
Hope to have drive with you tomorrow morning in place of letters
impossible to write R P BURNS

I suppose thats a fool telegram he admitted to himself as he hung
up the receiver but after that typing mess I had to express myself
somehow except by signs Now to get off Luckily this suitll do No
time to change anyhow

He telephoned for a sleeper berth he called up a village physician and
the house surgeon at the city hospital and made arrangements with each
for seeing his patients during the two nights and a day of his absence
He had no serious case on hand and of course no surgical work so that
it was easier to get away than it might be again for a year after his
arm should be once more to be counted on Then he interviewed Cynthia on
the subject of Bob after which he packed a small bag speculating with
some amusement as he did so on the succession of porters bellboys
waiters and hotel valets he should have to fee during the next
thirtysix hours to secure their necessary assistance from the
fastening of his shoes to the tying of his scarfs the cutting up of his
food and the rest of the hundred little services which must be rendered
the man with his right arm in a sling

I may not look a subject for travel Miss Mathewson he announced with
a brilliant smile appearing once more in the outer office where the
billcopying was just coming to a finish but Im off nevertheless
Thank you for your struggle with my schoolboy composition We wont need
to finish it ImOh thunder

It was the office bell Miss Mathewson answered it Burns prepared to
deny himself to all ordinary petitioners saw the mans face and stopped
to listen It was a roughlooking fellow who told him his brief story
but the hearer listened with attention and his face became grave He
turned to Miss Mathewson

Call Johnny Caruthers and the Imp please he directed Telephone
the Pullman ticket office and change my berth reservation from the
tenthirty to the one oclock train

He went out with the man and Miss Mathewson heard him say You walked
in Joe You can ride back with us on the runningboard

Ten minutes after he had gone Chester came again He found Miss
Mathewson reading by the office droplight On the desk stood a
travelling bag beside it lay a light overcoat not the sort that Red
Pepper was accustomed to wear in the car a dress overcoat with a silk
lining On it reposed a that and a pair of gloves rolled into a ball
man fashion Chester regarded with interest these unmistakable signs of
intended travel

Doctor Burns going out of town he inquired casually It must be
admitted that he had scented action of some sort on the wind which
had taken his friend from his company at the conclusion of the walk
Ordinarily Burns would have gone into Chesters den and settled down
for an hour of talk before bedtime

I believe so Miss Mathewson replied in the noncommittal manner of the
professional mans confidential assistant But he has gone out for a
call now

Back soon

I dont know Mr Chester

Did he go in the Imp

Yes

Country call probablytheyre the ones that bother a man at night as
long as he does country work Ive often told Doctor Burns it was time
he gave up this nocount rural practice Well do you know what time
his train goes

After midnight some time Miss Mathewson knew that Mr Chester was
Doctor Burnss close friend but she was too accustomed to keep her
lips closed over her employers affairs to give information even to
Chester except under protest

Hm Well I believe Ill sit up for him and help him off A onearmed
man needs an attendant Dont stay up Miss Mathewson Ill take any
message he may leave for you

Im afraid I ought to wait replied the faithful nurse doubtfully

I dont believe it Go home and go to bed like a tired girl as you
no doubt are and trust me If he wants you I promise to telephone you
Ill see him off and like to do it Come

There being no real reason for doing otherwise than follow this most
sensible advice Miss Mathewson went away Chester settling himself by
the droplight in the chair she had vacated fancied she looked a trifle
disappointed and wondered why Surely he reasoned the girl must get
enough of erratic night work without sitting up merely to hand Burns his
overcoat and wish him a pleasant journey

It was a long wait Chester enlivened it by telephoning Winifred that
he wouldnt be home till morningor sooner and elicited a flurry of
questioning which he evaded rather clumsily

It was all right for him to be curious concerning Reds affairs he
considered but there was no need for the women to get started on
inquisitive questions

He read himself asleep at last over the office magazines and was
awakened by a hurried step on the porch and a gust of November night air
on his warm face

What are you doing here was the question which assaulted him

Sitting up for you was Chesters sleepy reply He rubbed his eyes
Thought you might like to have me see you off

Im not going anywhere except back to the case Ive just left Go home
and go to bed

Chester sat up He looked at Burns with awakening interest He had
never seen his friends face look grimmer than it did now under the gray
slouch hat which he had worn for the tramp pulled well down over his
brows and which during all his preparations and his hasty departure
in the car it had not occurred to him to remove or to exchange for the
leather cap he usually wore on such trips

Back to a country case instead of to Washington Incredulity was
written large on Chesters face

Burns nodded growing grimmer than before if that were possible He
sat down on the arm of a chair glancing over at the desk where his
belongings lay How did you know I was going to Washington

Inferred it

Youre mighty quick at inference Maybe I wasnt But I was Now Im
not Thats all there is to it

But why not Cant you turn the case over Ill bet my hat its a
deadbeat case at that

Burns nodded again It is

Youre an ass then

Perhaps

You dont expectherto stay in Washington waiting for you do you
when she only came up for that wedding and is going straight back to
keep some other engagements Thats what Win says shes to do

No I dont expect her to wait Burns pulled the slouch hat lower yet
Chester could barely see his eyes He could only hear the tone of his
denial of any such absurd expectation

Chester rose and stood looking down at his friend who had folded his
left arm over his right in its sling as he sat on the chair arm and
looked the picture of dogged resignation

I suppose theres some reason at the bottom of what strikes me as pure
foolishness he admitted You wont do me the honour of mentioning
it

Case of infected wound in the foot Threatened tetanus Fiveyearold
child

Nobody competent to treat the case but you

Burns looked up Chester saw his eyes now gloomy but resolute No
Its up to me alone I owe it to the woman Its the only child she has
left a girl It was her boy I sent to a better world with maledictions
on his mothers head

Comprehension dawned at last on Chesters face He saw that taking into
consideration Burnss feeling in that matter there was really nothing
to be said I hope you win out he evolved at length from the
confusion of ideas in his mind

I hope I do Burns rose I must send a telegram he said and went
to the telephone in the inner office

While he was there Chester heard the honk of the Imps horn outside
When Burns came back he opened the outer door and called to Johnny
Caruthers to know if he had obtained the serum for which he had been
sent to the druggist Johnny shouted back that he had Burns turned to
Chester

Good night he said Much obliged for waiting up for me

Then with a certain fighting expression on his lips which Chester had
learned to know meant that his whole purpose was set on the attainment
of an end for which no price could be too great to pay Burns went out
to Johnny Caruthers and the Green Imp




CHAPTER XII IN WHICH HE HAS HIS OWN WAY


DocJoe Tressler followed Burns down the path leaving his wife
standing in the doorway her eyes fixed on the retreating figure of the
man who had saved to her her one remaining childDoc we aint agoin
to forget this

Neither am I Joe for various reasons replied Burns watching Johnny
Caruthers try the Green Imps spark He jumped in beside Johnny and
looked back at Joe Remember now keep things going just as I leave
them and I shall expect to find Letty nearly as well as ever when I see
her again I shall be back in five days Goodbye

Yes

Ill be around when you get back with some money

Burns looked the man in the eye Oh come Joe dont say anything you
dont mean

I mean it this time DoeI sure do Me and the old womanweLetty
The fellow choked

All right Joe Im as glad as you are Lettys safe Take care of her
Take care of your wife Do a stroke of good backbreaking work once
in a while Itll help that tired feeling of yours thats getting to be
dangerously chronic Youve no idea Joe what a satisfaction it is now
and then to feel that youve accomplished something Try it Goodbye

He waved his hand at the woman in the door who responded with a flutter
of her dingy apron which was immediately thereafter applied to
her eyes Within by the window a little palefaced girl hugged a
remarkable doll with yellow hair and a red silk frock

Youd ought to be pretty proud Letty Tressler said the woman
returning to the small convalescent to think Doc kissed you when he
left Hes been awful good to you Doc has and him with that arm in a
sling abothering him all the time But I didnt think hed do that

Maybe its cause Im so clean now speculated the child weakly When
he did it he whispered in my ear that he liked clean faces

Letty you aint goin to have any kind o face but a clean face after
this jest on account o Doc Burns vowed her mother emotionally and
the child her doll pressed against her face nodded

Far down the road Burns was bidding Johnny Caruthers put on more speed
We have to make time today Johnny he explained Im going to get
off on that tenthirty tonight if I have to break my other arm to do
it I dont know that Id be much more helpless than I am now if I
did Curious Johnny how many things there are a man cant do with one
hand

I should say you could do more with that left hand of yours than most
folks can with both declared young Caruthers honest admiration in his
eye

Burns laugheda hearty carefree laugh He was in wild spirits Johnny
could see that and wondered why the Doctor should be so happy over
pulling a deadbeat family out of their troubles Everybody knew Joe
Tressler And Johnny understood that the Doctor had given up going away
on Joes account ten days ago when he took the case on the eve of his
departure Johnny had seen his employer in all stages of tension since
that day as he had driven him out at first halfadozen times in the
twentyfour hours to this same little old wreck of a house Johnny had
driven him to other houses also to one especially in the city where
the lad had sat and speculated much on the extremes of experience in the
life of a busy practitioner

It was to this same house that Johnny took Burns next a house reached
by a long drive through wonderful grounds to a palace of a home within
which the man with his arm in the sling disappeared with precisely
the same rather brusque and hurried bearing characteristic of him
everywhere But Johnny could not see within If he had his honest eyes
might have opened still wider

On his way upstairs Burns was intercepted by the master of the house

Youve decided to go with us Doctor Burns I hope The question
was put in the fashion of a person who expects but one answer But the
answer proved to be not that one expected

Im sorry but I cant do it Mr Walworth Burnss left hand in the
cordial grip which expresses hearty liking was retained while William
Walworth who was accustomed to be able to arrange all things to his
pleasure by the simple expedient of paying whatever it might cost
stared into the bright hazel eyes which met his with their usual
straightforward glance

Cant But you must my dear Doctor Pardon me but I feel that no
ordinary considerations can be allowed to stand in the way My daughter
needs your care on this journey Her mother and I have agreed that her
wish to have you with us must be fulfilled Its an essential factor in
her recovery

Its not essential at all Mr Walworth Miss Evelyn is well started
on the road to full health she has only to keep on My going with you
would be a mere matter of pleasing her and thats not in the least
necessary

His smile softened the words which struck upon the ear of the magnate
with an unaccustomed sound Mr Walworth released Burnss hand his
manner stiffening slightly

I must differ with you Doctor I feel that at this stage Evelyns
pleasure is a thing to be planned for She has taken this fancy to have
you with us on the Mediterranean cruise Well agree to land you and
send you home at the end of a couple of months if you positively feel
that you cant neglect your practice longer But let me remind you
Doctor that your fee will be made to cover all possible income from
your practice during that time andI shall not be contented to measure
its size by that

It was Burnss turn to stiffen within if he did not let it show
outwardly He spoke positively and finally Even William Walworth saw
that it would be of no use to urge a man who said quite quietly

Ive thought it over as I promised you and decided against it
I assure you I appreciate the honour you would do me and I should
immensely like the experience But I know my going is not necessary to
Miss Evelyns recovery and thats the only thing that could make me
hesitate Ill go up and see her at once if you will forgive my haste
I have a busy day before me

William Walworth looked after him as he ran up the stately staircase
and his thoughts were somewhat as Johnny Carutherss had been Hes
more of a man crippled like that than any I know I wonder why he
wont go I wonder But he wont thats settled Now to appease Evelyn
Hell not find that so easy

Burns did not find it easy He sat down beside the convalescent a
patient who had everything on her side with which to win her chosen
physicians consent to stay by her till she should be in the possession
once more of the blooming beauty which had made her one of the envied
of the earth He told her in the direct manner he had used with her
father that he could not fall in with their plans

When he came away he was tingling all over It had been so plain She
had tried to disguise it but she was where she could not run to cover
and he had seen it all It gave him no pleasure he was not that sort
He was sorry for the girl but he was not in the least anxious
about her She would get over it it was not his faulthe was
conscienceclear on that If ever he had been coollyhowever
kindlyprofessional in his bearing it had been in this home of great
wealth where it would have gone against his inmost grain to have
seemed to court liking If anything his orders had been more curt his
concessions fewer his whole treatment of the case on simpler lines than
it might have been in almost any less pretentious home with which he was
familiar

He ran down the stone steps in eager haste to be gone his vision still
engaged with the reproachful look Evelyns mother had given him when
she heard of his incredible refusal to accompany the Walworths on the
luxuriouslyequipped expedition in search of recuperation and enjoyment
for the idolized only daughter This settles me with them to the end of
time I suppose he said to himself As the car ran down the drive
he straightened his shoulders with a sense of thankfulness that his
practice was not often in the homes of the comparatively few people who
can afford to buy even that most precious of commodities the time of
others when that time has been consecrated to certain uses

Not going to stop for lunch Doctor inquired young Caruthers
anxiously as the round of calls went on and one oclock passed with
the Imp in a portion of the city remote from the hotel at which Burns
was accustomed to refresh himself and Johnny when home was out of the
question

Well go to the hospital next and I shall be there a couple of hours
You can go and fill up then I must be back at the office by fourfor
engagements

So the day went The busy physician who goes out of town for even a five
days vacation must plan for it and do much arranging in various ways
In spite of the fact that it would still be many weeks before Burns
could attempt surgery again he was having plenty to do Only the
determination to get away this time without fail made it possible for
him to go But there would be never a time when he could better be
spared and he meant to let nothing hinder his purpose

The arms coming on well was Doctor Bullers verdict late that
afternoon as he gave the healing member its usual manipulation and
massage It takes patience to wait though doesnt it Burns Never
tried a broken arm myself but I should say that hand must be itching to
be at work in the operatingroom again

Itching Its burning blistering scarifying I never knew how I liked
that part of my work till I had to come down to an exclusive practice
in pills and plasters Graysons doing a stunt today that would have
driven me mad with envy if I could have stopped to look on Doing it
cleverly too by the report I had from Van Horn just now When Van
takes the trouble to praise another man it means something

Means its been forced from him commented Buller Besides Van
enjoys praising Grayson to you Hes enjoyed your smashed arm too the
old fraud Was he ever so decent to you before

Burns laughed You cant strike fire that way today he declared
Hold on Youre not going to put that arm back into the splints

Of course I am It lacks two days yet off the shortest modern
regulation period Come on here

Leave em off Ill take the consequences

Dont be foolish man If I had my way Id keep the thing put up
another full week Im not an advocate of this hurry business

I am The arms well enough to come out Ill wear it in a sling but
I want my coat sleeve on and Im going to have it on Fix me up will
you Im in a hurry

Youre going on a journey

Yes Get busy

Thats the very reason why you should keep that arm out of danger till
you get back Jostling round in a crowd

Is this my arm or yours thundered Burns

Buller laughed Dont knock me down with it Pepperpot It may be your
arm but youre my patient and I

Dont you fool yourself If you wont fix me up Ill go out with it
hanging I can judge my own condition Will you dress me and put any
arm in this sling here or must I send for Grayson Hes none of your
idiotic conservatives

Keep quiet and Ill make you look pretty little boy I seethese are
new clothes just home from the tailor and theyre an elegant fit Bully
fresh scarf peach of a pin brandnew black silk slingOh I say

For with his good left arm Burns was threatening his professional friend
in a way that looked ominous But a laugh was in his eye now that he
had got his way and the altercation ended in a fire of jokes Then
Burns stood up

Youre a jewel Buller boy said he Youve brought me through in
great shape It was a nasty fracture and youve given me an arm thatll
be as good as new Im gratefulyou know that Now if youll look over
that list I gave you of cases here in the city and go out once to take
a look at Letty Tressler Ill be ever faithfully yours Griggsll see
to my village practice Now Im off

Hope you enjoy your trip Must be a concentrated pleasure to be
crammed into five days and still make you look like a schoolboy just let
out observed Buller as Burns turned with his band on the doorknob

A dose doesnt have to be big to be powerful rejoined Burns opening
the door

Nitroglycerin eh Buller called after the departing bulk of his
friend Dont let it carry you too far up You might come down with a
thud

Hes right enough there was what Burns murmured to himself as he
caught the elevator in the great building in which Bullers office was
a crowded corner I may come down in just that style But better that
than any more of this dead level of suspense I dont think I could
stand that one more day

He and Johnny Caruthers whirled home in the Imp to find Burnss village
office as crowded as Bullers city one It was late before he could get
his dinner and after it he was kept busy turning calls over to other
men It was the usual experience to have work pile up during the last
hours as if Fate were against his breaking his chains and meant to tie
him hand and foot

Im going to get out of this right now he announced suddenly to Miss
Mathewson an hour before train time as he turned away from a siege over
the telephone with one hysterical lady who felt that her life depended
upon his remaining to see her through an attack of indigestion If I
dont something will come in that will pull hard to keep me home and
Im not going to be kept Ill trust you not to look me up for the next
hour for Ill not tell you where Im going and you cant guess you
know Goodbye Be a good girl

He wrung her hand looking at her with that warmth of friendliness which
he was accustomed when in the mood to bestow on her recognizing how
invaluable she was to him and never once recking what it meant to her
to be so closely associated with him She answered in her usual quiet
way wishing him a safe journey and bidding him be very careful of the
arm no longer protected except by the silken sign that injury had been
done

In a crowd you know they wont notice the sling she warned him

Wont they Well if my trusty left cant protect my battered right
Ive forgotten my boxing tricks Dont be anxious about that little
friend See that Amy Mathewson has a good time in my absence will you
Shes looking just a bit worn to me

She smiled but her eyes did not meet his she dared not let them With
all his kindness to her he did not often speak with the real affection
which was in his voice now She understood that he was for some reason
keyed high over his prospective journey even higher than he had been ten
days before when on the point of leaving And she knew well enough where
he was going though he had not told her It would have taken thirtysix
hours to go to Washington spend a brief time there and return It was
going to take five days to go to South Carolina remain long enough to
transact his businesswas it businessand come back And there had
been no more attempts to write letters by way of an amanuensis The
affection for his assistant in his manner to her was genuine she did
not doubt that but it did not deceive her for a moment So she did
not let her eyes meet his They rested instead on the scarfpin which
Buller had termed a peach but they did not see it She could not
remember when it had been so hard to maintain that quiet control of
herself which had long since made her employer cease to reckon with the
possibilities of fire beneath

R P Burns stole away with Johnny and the Imp without so much as
letting his neighbours know of his intentions He had made sure that
they were all well that no incipient scarlet fever or invading measles
was threatening them He smiled to himself as the car went past the
Chester house to think how interested they would be to know where he
was going But he got safely off and nobody opened a door at sound of
the Imp to call to him to come in a minute because somebody seemed not
quite well

And then after all he ran upon Arthur Chesterand at the city
station to which he had taken the precaution to go although the
tenthirty stopped for a halfminute at the village It must be admitted
that he tried to dodge his best friend but he did not succeed His
shoulders were too conspicuous he could not get away

Going to see an outoftown patient at this hour of night queried
Chester coming up warmly interested as best friends have a trick of
being in spite of all that can be done to avert their curiosity

Where else would I be going

I dont know where else but I doubt if its to see a patient Theres
an air about you thats not professional Youeryou cant be going to
Washington Theres nobody there now

No only a few Government officials and some odds and ends of
hangerson To be sure Congress is in session but theres nobody
there My trains been called Ches so long

Let me carry your bag Chester reached for it I say this isnt a
toolkitthis is a stunner of a regulation travelling bag See here
Red he was rushing along on the others side fairly running to keep
up with Burnss strideshow long are you going to be gone

Long enough to get a change of air The atmospheres heavy here with
inquisitive people who call themselves your friends See here Ches
youre not looking well You need rest and sleep Go home and go to
bed

Youre always telling me to go home and go to bed Not till I see which
train you take panted Chester his eyes sparkling Ha Going to turn
in at Number Four gate are you Sorry I cant take your bag inside
Well possibly I can guess your destination Got your section clear
through to South Carolina I say keep your head old man keep your
head

Burns turned about shook his fist at Arthur Chester seized his bag
rushed through the gateway and boarded the last of the long string of
Pullmans On the platform he pulled off his hat and waved it at his
friend He could forgive anybody for anything tonight




CHAPTER XIII IN WHICH HE MAKES NO EVENING CALL


Burns opened the white gateit was sagging a little on its hingesand
walked up the mossgrown path between the rows of liveoaks to the
tallcolumned portico of the still stately if somewhat timeworn and
decayed mansion among the shrubbery It was just at dusk and far away
somewhere a whippoorwill was calling It was the only sound on the quiet
air

The door was opened by an old negro servant who hesitated over his
answer to the question put by this unknown person looming up before him
with his arm in a sling Mrs Elmore was in but she was not well and
could not see any visitors this evening

Is Mrs Lessing in

Yas Sah she is But she done tole me she couldnt see nobody hersef
She tekkin cah ob Miss Lucy

Burns produced his card and made a persuasive request The old darky
led the way to a long nearly dark apartment where the scent of roses
mingled with the peculiar odour of old mahogany and ancient rugs and
hangings The servant lit a tall antique lamp with crystal pendants
hanging from its shade the light from which fell upon a bowlful of
crimson roses so that they glowed richly He left Burns departing
with a shufing step and an air of grudging the strange gentleman the
occupancy of the room although it was to be for only so long as it
would take to bring back word that neither of the ladies would see him
tonight

Burns sat still for the space of two minutes then as no further sound
could be heard in the quiet house he became restless His pulses beat
rather heavily and to quiet them or the sense of them he got up and
walked about pausing at one of the long French windows to gaze out
into the dusky labyrinth of a garden where he could just make out paths
winding about among the bushes The night was mild and the window stood
ajar as if some one had lately come in

Then he turned and saw her She had almost reached him but he had not
heard her her footfall upon the old Turkey carpet with its faded roses
and lilies had been so light She was in white and the light from the
old lamp shone on her arms end face and brought out the shadows of her
hair and eyes She put out both handsthen quickly drew back one as her
glance fell upon the sling and gave him her left smiling But he drew
the arm that had been broken out of its support and held it out

Please take this hand too he said It will be its first experience
and perhaps it will put new life into it Its pretty limp yet

She laid hers in it very gently looking down at it as his fingers
closed slowly over hers

Thats doing very well I should think she said Its barely time
for it to be independent yet is it

About time I had something of a wrestle with Doctor Buller to get him
to leave the splints off How warm and soft your hand is This one of
mine has forgotten how the touch of another hand feels

Im sure you ought not to use it yet Please put it back in the sling
She drew her own hand gently away

It occurred to him that while he had been absent from her he had not
been able to recall half her charm and that if he had he would never
have been able to wait half so long before pursuing her down into this
Southern haunt of hers He drew a full contented breath

At last he said I am face to face with you Its worth the
journey

In the lamplight it seemed to him the rose cast a reflection on her face
which he had not observed at first

Im so sorry Aunt Lucy isnt able to see you tonight she
saidunless she would consent go see you professionally She really
ought

He held up his hand Not unless she is in serious straits please he
begged Ive fled from patients only to find them all the way down
on the train I dont know what there can be about me to suggest to a
conductor that Im the man hes looking for to attend some emergency
case but he seems to spot me Only at the station before this did I get
released from the last of the series Let me forget my profession for a
bit if I can just now Im only a man whos come a long way to see you
Is it really you

He leaned forward studying her intently His head with its coppery
thatch of heavy hair showed powerful lines in the lamplight beneath
his dark throws the hazel eyes glowed black

Its certainly I she answered lightly And being I with the
mistress of the house prevented from showing you hospitality I must
offer it She begged me to make you comfortable and to tell you she
would see you in the morning Youve had a long journey You must want
the comfort of a room and hot water Ill ring for Old Sam

She crossed the room and pulled an oldfashioned bellcord upon which a
bell was heard to jangle far away The old darky reappeared

I should have gone to a hotel Burns said if I could have found one
in the place

There is none And if there had been Aunt Lucy would have been much
hurt to have you go there Where did you leave your bag

At the station I can stay only for a night and a day so its a small
one

Ill send Young Sam for it Now let Sam take you to your room and in a
few minutes Ill give you supper

Dont bother about supper at this hour I only want

You want what you are to havesome of Sues delicious Southern
cookery She smiled at him as he looked back at her following the old
servant Shes been in the family for forty years and she loves to have
company to appreciate her dishes Sam you are to help Doctor Burns He
has had a broken arm

When Burns came down fresh from a bath and comfortable with clean
linen he smelled odours which made him realize that eager as he was
for other things he was human enough to be intensely hungry with a
healthy mans appetite So he surrendered himself to the fortunes that
now befell him

Old Sam conducted him to the diningroom a quaintly attractive
apartment where candlelight illumined the bare mahogany of the round
table laid with a large square of linen at his place and set with
delicate ancient china and silver Ellen Lessing was already there in
a highbacked chair opposite the one set for him a figure to which his
eyes were again drawn irresistibly and upon which they continued to rest
as he took his seat

Sam disappeared toward the kitchen and Burns spoke in a low voice
across the table

I feel as if I were in a dream said he Fortyeight hours ago I
was rushing about hundreds of miles from here trying to attend to the
wants of a lot of people who seemed determined not to let me get away
Now Im down here in the midst of all this quiet and peace with you
before me to look at and nobody to demand anything of me for at least
twentyfour hours Its all too good to be true

It seems rather odd to me too she answered letting her eyes stray
from his and rest upon the bowl of japonicas of a glowing pink which
stood in the centre of the table The candlelight made little starry
points in her dark eyes as she looked at the richhued blooms The last
person in the world I was expecting to see tonight was you

I suppose I was as far from your thoughts as your expectation he
suggested

How should I be thinking of a person who had not written to me for so
long I thought he had forgotten me she asked and then as he broke out
into a delighted laugh at her expense she grew as pink as her flowers
and seemed to welcome the return of Sam bearing a trayful of Sues good
things to eat

Fried chicken and sweet potatoes beaten biscuit and fragrant coffee
had a flavour all their own to Burns that night He ate as a hungry man
should yet never forgot his companion for a moment or allowed her to
imagine that he forgot her And by and by the meal was over and the two
rose from the table

I must go and see that Auntie is comfortable for the night if you will
excuse me for half an hour said the person he had come to see Will
you wait in the drawingroom I will have Sam bring you some late
magazines

Ill wait and no magazines thank you I can fill the time somehow
he answered But dont let it be more than the halfhour will you

He watched her until she disappeared from his sight at the turn of the
staircase landing then went in to pace up and down the long room his
left arm folded over his right after the fashion he had acquired since
the right arm became useless After what seemed an interminable interval
she came back He met her at the door

Are the duties all done he inquired

All done for the present I must look in on Auntie by and by but I
think she is going to sleep

May she sleep the sleep of the just And theres nothing more you feel
it incumbent upon you to do for me No more sending me to my room no
more waiting upon me by Sam no more feeding me till my capacity is
reached Is there really no notion in your mind as to how you can put
off the coming hour

His voice had its old whimsical inflection but there was a deeper note
in it too She parried him gently yet not quite so composedly as was
her wont

Why should I want to put if off Arent we going to sit down and have
a delightful talk I want to hear all about Bob and Martha and all of
them and about your work since I saw you

You want to hear all about those things do you I had the impression
that we discussed them quite thoroughly while I was at supper Still
I can go over them all again if you insist It may take up another five
minutes and when one is fencing for time even five minutes counts

It was his old way with a vengeance There was a saying of Arthur
Chesters current among his and Burnss friends that it never was of any
use to try to evade Red Pepper when once he had begun to fire upon your
defenses With his eyes searching you and his insolent tongue putting
point blank questions to you you might as well capitulate first as
last

There being no conceivable answer to this thrust about fencing for time
even for a woman experienced in replying skilfully to men under all
sorts of conditions Ellen Lessing was forced to look up or play the
part of a shy girl So she looked up lifting her head bravely There
really was nothing else to do

It was all in his face He had not come all those hundreds of miles to
pay her an evening call nor did he mean to be put off longer His eyes
held hers she could not withdraw them

Its odd he said speaking slowly how like a magnet drawing a steel
bar youve drawn me down here Pullpullpullan irresistible force I
wonder if the magnet feels the attraction too Could it pull so hard if
it didnt

There was a long minute during which neither stirredit might have
been the counterpart of that minute months back when they had first
observed each other Recognition it was perhaps at the very first
there could be no question about the recognition nowit went deep

Suddenly he slipped his right arm out of the sling Before she could
draw breath she was in the circle of his arms but he had not touched
her

Am I wrong he was saying Has it pulled both ways from the first

It must be as useless for the magnet to resist as for the bar And when
they have come within a certain distance of each other

If Red Peppers left arm caught her in the stronger grasp the right did
all and more than all that could have been expected of it It was
his right arm which slowly drew her hands up one after the other and
indicated to them that their place was locked together behind his
neck


An old garden in South Carolina is a place to lure the Northerner
outofdoors Before breakfast next morning Burns was walking down the
boxbordered paths feasting his gaze and his sense of fragrance on
the clumps of blue and white violets the clusters of gay crocuses the
splendid spikes of Roman hyacinths But he did not fail to keep track of
all doorways in sight and when she appeared at the open French window
of the drawingroom he was there in a trice offering her a bunch of
purple violets and feasting his eyes upon her morning freshness

Im still dreaming I think said he when he had drawn her back
into the quiet room long enough to satisfy himself with the active
demonstration that possession means privilege and had himself fastened
the violets in the front of her crisp white morning dress Dreaming
that I can stay down here in this wonderful paradise with you and not go
back to the slaves life I lead

You would never be happy away from that slaves life long you know
she reminded him The rush of it is the joy of it to you

How will it be to you I shall be yours you remember till Joe
Tressler or any other neerdoweel wants me then Im his

But youll always come back to me said she

And will you be content with that

So long as you want to come back

He looked steadily into her eyes and his own took fire Want to come
back Ive waited a long time to find the woman I could be sure I should
always want to come back to I thought there would never be such a
woman not for an erratic fellow like me But now Im wondering how I
shall ever be able to stay away




CHAPTER XIV IN WHICH HE DEFIES SUPERSTITION


Hades of Hymen Red are you making calls this morning

Why not Im not to be married till noon am I

I say take me with you will you I want to go along with a man who
has the nerve to see patients up to the last minute before his wedding

Takes less nerve than to sit around and wait for the fateful hour I
should say Come on if you think youll have time to dress when you get
back It may be close work

Havent you got to dress yourself demanded Arthur Chester settling
himself in the car beside its driver Or shall you go to the altar in
tweeds with April mud on your boots

Rather than not get there yes But I can dress in half the time you
canalways could and necessity has developed the art Look here there
isnt any April mud The roads are fine

Oh I suppose if I were booked for a wedding journey in the Green Imp
before the leaves were fairly out I shouldnt be able to see any mud
myself As it is well I dont know the colour of the brides motoring
clothes but I presume theyll be adapted to the circumstances I never
saw her look anything but ready for whatever situation she happened to
be in Thats a trick thatll serve her many a good turn as the wife of
R P Burns MD eh Red

The Imp whirled about the country all the morning having made an early
start The car was in fine fettle like a horse that has been trained
for a race Although it was beginning its second season it had never
been in better trim for business The engine having been cared for and
seldom abused was running more smoothly than when it had been first put
upon the road The Imp had had a fresh coat of the darkgreen which gave
it its name and its brasswork was shining as only Johnny Caruthers by
long and untiring labors could make metal shine It had that morning
acquired a luggagerack attached to its rear which was soon to receive
a leathercovered motor trunk at that moment receiving its final
consignments in the Macauley house and there were several other new
fittings about the machine which indicated that it was presently to be
put to uses which had never been required of it before

The Imp drew up in front of the hospital Chester looked anxiously at
his watch for the twentyseventh time that morning For Heavens sake
hurry Red he urged Women are the dickens about having a wedding
late and its ten minutes of eleven now Noon comes sure and soon and
at noon allow me to remind you

Burns nodded Keep cool boy he recommended No use getting excited
before a critical operation

But he disappeared at a pace fast enough to satisfy Chester who sat
back and said to himself that R P had come nearer giving the crisis
before him its appropriate name than he had ever heard done before

He became anxious again however before Burns returned and his watch
was in his hand when the prospective bridegroom bolted out of the
hospital door and ran for his car as if he had not a moment to spare

Glad to see youre losing your head a trifle at last commented
Chester as the Imp turned a dizzy curve and shot away Its the only
proper thing But weve really enough time if you dont stop anywhere
else Whats the matter Good Lord man youll get nabbed if you speed
up like this within limits You

Cut it and dont talk Ive got to make time was all the answer
or explanation he received and Chester with the wisdom of long
association with Red Pepper at his pepperest obeyed

As they approached the house Burns spoke for the first time since they
had left the city Go in and tell the bunch I have to do an operation
at the hospital as quick as I can get my stuff and drive back there
Ill be back at

Great Christopher man But

I can be back by two Ellen will understand

The deuce she will Dont ask me to explain to her

I wont Ill do it myself You tell the rest

The Imp shot up the driveway Burns jumped out and ran to his office
Five minutes later instrument bag in hand he ran out again Miss
Mathewson following He bolted in at the Macauleys front door Chester
had already broken the incredible news to Martha Macauley and was
standing out a storm of expostulations and reproaches as if by any
chance anybody could expect Arthur Chester to be able to stop R P
Burns when he had started upon any course of action whatsoever But when
Burns himself appeared at the doorway the situation came to a crisis
Towering beside a group of palms which decorated the foot of the
staircase Burns demanded to see Ellen

Why Red you cant Shesbesides how can you

Ask her to come where I can speak to her then Quick please

But she

There was no knowing how long the sparring might have lasted or what
extreme measures might have been taken had not a figure in a floating
lilacandwhite garment with two long braids of dark hair hanging over
its shoulders appeared upon the staircase landing Burns looked up saw
it and was up the stairs to the landing before Chester could flick an
eyelash

Dear to save a life I want to delay things just two hours Theres
nobody else to do it Van Horn was taken ill just as he was
getting ready The only other man who would venture under the
conditionsGraysonis out of town

His arms were about her as she stood a step above him So her eyes were
level with his

Do it of course she whispered And take my love with you

For one minute Burns stayed to tell her that he had known she would
send him to his duty then he was off The door slammed behind him and
outside the Imps horn sent back a parting salute

From the bottom stair Martha Macauley distressed young matron
and hostess gazed up at her sister who with arms leaning on the
vinewreathed rail at the landing was smiling down at her

Ellen Was ever anything so crazy I did suppose Red would take time
enough to be married in Theres everybody coming

So few you can easily telephone them all to wait

And the breakfast under way

It will keep

Arent you superstitious enough not to want to postpone your wedding
demanded Martha urgently

The dark braids of hair swung violently as the brides head was
emphatically shaken Martha Take it back Let somebody die because I
was afraid to wait two hours

I dont believe anybody would die insisted Martha Somebody could be
found Its just Reds ridiculous craze for surgery I always said hed
rather operate than eat Now it seems hed rather operate than be

But at this moment a large determined hand came over her mouth from
behind as James Macauley junior arriving upon the scene asserted
his authority He was in bathrobe and slippers having been excitedly
interviewed by Chester through the bathroom door

Quit fussing Marty The thing cant be helped and if Ellen doesnt
mind I dont know why we should If we were having a houseful it would
be fierce but with only ourselves and the Chesters and the ministers
family and Reds peopleIll go telephone Mr Harding now

As Martha freed herself from the silencing hand the front door opened
again This time it was Mrs Richard WarburtonBurnss young sister
Annealso in somewhat informal attire over which she had thrown an
evening coat She surveyed the group with laughing eyes She herself had
been married within the year

Its absurd isnt it she cried But its just like Red Ellen knows
that dont you dear Ellenll not only take him for better and for
worse but for present and for absentmostly absent But were rather
proud of him over at the house Fathers walking up and down and
saying no other fellow would have done it and Mothers all tearful and
smiling Dick wanted to go in with him but of course Miss Mathewson had
to go he seldom operates without her

Its so uncertain when hell get back mourned Martha still
unreconciled

I made Miss Mathewson promise to telephone the moment she should know
Its lucky the wedding guests are all in the family isnt it Ellen
dearpretty Anne ran up the stairs to the landingI really dont see
how after he caught sight of you in that fascinating garb with your
hair down he could ever tear himself away Youre positively the
loveliest thing I ever saw in all my life and Im almost out of my
senses with joy that youre to be my sister even though I never saw you
in the world till yesterday I always said when Red did care for anybody
for keeps shed be a jewel

Red Pepper came back at precisely twenty minutes of three His patient
had given him a bad hour of anxiety immediately after leaving the table
and he could not desert her until she had rallied But he felt
easy about her now and he had arranged to leave her in Bullers
handsBuller who did not do major surgery himself but was a most
competent man when it came to the care of surgical patients after
operation Burns brought Amy Mathewson back with him though she had
begged to be allowed to stay with the case

And not be at my wedding cried Red Pepper in exuberant spirits
Why I couldnt be properly married without you to see me through

Upon which she had smiled and obeyed him and taken a tighter grip upon
herself as he put her into the Green Imp for the last ride together
That was what it was to her though she might yet go with him a thousand
times to help him in his work To him it was a quick and joyful journey
back to his marriage

All right Mother and Dad he exulted coming in upon them in their
festal array He shook hands with his father and his brotherinlaw he
kissed his mother Then he ran for his own room where Bobby Burns just
being finished off by Anne herself superbly dressed shrieked with
rapture at the sight of him

Red At last Ive laid everything ready youve only to jump into your
bath I turned on the water when Dick saw the Imp down the road Dont
you dare have a vestige of a surgical odour about you when you come
out

In precisely seventeen minutes and threequarters the bridegroom was
ready to the last coppery affair on his head

Have I a surgical odour Anne he asked as he came up to her

She buried her face on his shoulder both arms about him regardless of
her finery Youre the dearest sweetest old trump of a brother that
ever lived and you smell like sunshine and fresh air she cried
Whereat he shook with laughter and patted her back as she clung to him

Promise me Red she begged lifting her head that you wont let
anythinganythingkeep you from going off with Ellen in the Imp Shes
been so lovely about this horrid delay but Im always suspicious of
you Promise

I promise you this agreed her brother Wherever the Imp and I go
after the minister has said the words for this two weeks Ellen shall go
with me



Chester said Dick Warburton as he stood in that gentlemans company
looking over a stupendous assortment of wedding gifts which in
spite of the fact that nobody outside the family had been asked to see
Redfield Pepper Burns married overflowed two large rooms into the upper
hall and almost over the railing will you tell me who in the name of
time sent that rattrap This is the most extraordinary display of
gold silver and tinware that I ever saw and Im at the end of my
astonishment But that rattrap is it a joke

No joke whatever declared Chester It comes from one of R
Redsdevoted friendshis own invention And the point of the thing is
that the making of that rattrap is going to be the making of the
worst deadbeat of a patient Red ever stood by I really believe Joe
Tresslers going to get a patent on it which also will be Reds doing
But this is a special particular rattrap made of extra fine materials
suitable for a wedding gift

Well well mused Burnss brotherinlaw And what millionaire sent
the diamond pendant By Jove I havent seen finer jewels than those
this side of the water

That came from the Walworths I believe Take it all together its a
great collection isnt it It shows up the odder because Ellen wouldnt
have the freak gratefulpatient gifts put to one sideor even thrown
into a sort of refining shadow Fix your eye on that rainbow quilt will
you Dicky alongside of the Florentine tapestry That quilt would put
out your eye if you gazed upon it steadily so let up on it by regarding
this matchsafe Wouldnt that

That came from Johnny Caruthers said a richly modulated low voice
behind him Please set it down carefully Mr Arthur Chester

The two men wheeled to see the bride come to the defense of her wedding
gifts Behind her loomed her husband laughing over her head his eyes
none the less tender like hers for the queer presents which meant no
less of love and gratitude than the costlier gifts of which there was
no mean array

I see youve married him patients and all Ellen Burns declared
Richard Warburton On the whole its your wisest course The less he
knows you mind their devotion to him

Mind it She gave him the flash of which the soft black eyes were
brilliantly capable Dick I have no gift I like so well as that
rattrap You dont know the story but I do and it means to
mefidelity to duty And if theres one great big thing in the world I
think its that

Over her head Dick Warburton nodded at his brotherinlaw Im glad
weve got her into the family Red said he Its a mighty rare thing
to find a beautiful woman who knows how to dress like a picture with
that ideal at the back of her head Cherish her Red If you dont Ill
come around and knock you down

Ill let you do it agreed Burns soberly All his marriage vows were
in his face

It was quite dusk when the Green Imp got away Johnny Caruthers had the
satisfaction of lighting up the cars lampsalways a joy to him and
particularly so tonight for even the oil taillight bore witness to his
trimming and polishing till its red eye could gleam no brighter As for
the front lamps and the searchlight the Imps progress would be as down
an avenue of brilliance if its driver allowed them all full play upon
the road

Shes in great trim Johnny said Burnss voice in his ear I like
her looks immensely I shall hate to get a speck of mud on her

Meaning the lady Doc asked Johnny anxiously Theres a wet bit
there under the elms Doc remember It would be a pity to splash any
mud on her

He glanced toward the porch his freckled face eloquent of his
admiration for the figure which was the centre of the group gathered
there

Burnss eyes followed his Bob a picturesque small person in his
wedding attire of white linen was attempting to tie Ellens motorveil
for her as she stooped smiling to the level of his eager little arms
It occurred to both master and man as they watched the childs efforts
to adjust the floating chiffon that veils however useful were to be
regretted when they were allowed even partially to obscure faces like
those of Red Peppers wife

I meant the car lad explained Burns laughing Youve done a great
piece of work an her since I brought her home this afternoon Im afraid
youve done some last polishing with your wedding clothes on Johnny
Heres some thing to take the spots out

Oh Doc breathed the boy Not tonight Let me do itfor youand
her

The money went back into Burnss pocket and his hand met Johnnys in
a hearty grasp Thats better yet said he and thank you John If
anybody but you were sending me off Id ask if everything was surely in
the car But Ill not even ask you

You dont need to vowed the boy proudly And theres some things in
you dont need to know about just extrys in case of breakdown

Now that said his employer is what call proving ones self a
friend

The Imp went cautiously through the wet bit for it lay under the
corner arclight and Johnny Caruthers would be watching But once on
the open road outside the village the pace quickened For late April
the roads were not bad and if they had been sloughs the Imp Could have
pulled through them She had a great power hidden away in those six
cylinders of hers had the Imp

Youll not mind if I stop at the hospital as we go through questioned
Burns Then well be off out the old west road out of reach of
telephones and summonses of any sort But I shall be just that much
easier

Do stop please Im sure youll be more satisfied and so shall I

She sat quietly in the car while he was gone looking up at the lighted
windows and thinking all sorts of sympathetic thoughts concerning those
insideyet with a tiny fear in her heart that he would find some new
and unavoidable duty to detain him If he should

But he was back and as the Imps searchlight fell upon his face
returning she read there that he was free

Doing well everything satisfactory and Ive not a care in the world
he exulted as he leaped in Now were off and never a stop till weve
put a wide space between us and the rest of them

The Green Imp ran at its quietest along the city streets then through
the thinning suburbs and finally with the lights all behind them the
open country ahead the long low car came out upon the straight
highway which leads a hundred miles before it comes again to any but
insignificant hamlets and small rustic inns

Burns had said little thus far but as he glanced over his shoulder at
the now distant lights of the city he suddenly spoke low out of the
quiet

Were out of reach of everything and everybody nobody even knows the
road were taking Were all alone in the world together You cant
think what that means to me Ive lived nine years at the call of every
soul that wanted me hardly a vacation except for study A fortnight
seems pretty short allowance for a honeymoon well take a longer one
when we go to Germany in the fall Butfor two weeks

He looked down at her in the April starlight He bent to finish the
statement whatever it might have been upon her lips for speech failed
him Then with a happy laugh he gave the Green Imp her head
