THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING By Rudyard Kipling

 Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found
 worthy

The Law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not
easy to follow I have been fellow to a beggar again and again under
circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other
was worthy I have still to be brother to a Prince though I once came
near to kinship with what might have been a veritable King and was
promised the reversion of a Kingdomarmy lawcourts revenue and
policy all complete But today I greatly fear that my King is dead
and if I want a crown I must go hunt it for myself

The beginning of everything was in a railwaytrain upon the road to Mhow
from Ajmir There had been a Deficit in the Budget which necessitated
travelling not Secondclass which is only half as dear as FirstClass
but by Intermediate which is very awful indeed There are no cushions
in the Intermediate class and the population are either Intermediate
which is Eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty
or Loafer which is amusing though intoxicated Intermediates do not buy
from refreshmentrooms They carry their food in bundles and pots and
buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside
water This is why in hot weather Intermediates are taken out of the
carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon

My particular Intermediate happened to be empty till I reached
Nasirabad when the big blackbrowed gentleman in shirtsleeves entered
and following the custom of Intermediates passed the time of day He
was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated
taste for whisky He told tales of things he had seen and done of
outoftheway corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated and
of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days food

If India was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than
the crows where theyd get their next days rations it isnt seventy
millions of revenue the land would be payingits seven hundred
millions said he and as I looked at his mouth and chin I was disposed
to agree with him

We talked politicsthe politics of Loaferdom that sees things from
the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed offand we
talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram
back from the next station to Ajmir the turningoff place from the
Bombay to the Mhow line as you travel westward My friend had no money
beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and I had no money at
all owing to the hitch in the Budget before mentioned Further I was
going into a wilderness where though I should resume touch with the
Treasury there were no telegraph offices I was therefore unable to
help him in any way

We might threaten a Stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick
said my friend but thatd mean inquiries for you and for me and
_I_ve got my hands full these days Did you say you were travelling
back along this line within any days

Within ten I said

Cant you make it eight said he Mine is rather urgent business

I can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you I
said

I couldnt trust the wire to fetch him now I think of it Its this
way He leaves Delhi on the 23rd for Bombay That means hell be running
through Ajmir about the night of the 23rd

But Im going into the Indian Desert I explained

Well _and_ good said he Youll be changing at Marwar Junction to
get into Jodhpore territoryyou must do thatand hell be coming
through Marwar Junction in the early morning of the 24th by the
Bombay Mail Can you be at Marwar Junction on that time T wont be
inconveniencing you because I know that theres precious few pickings
to be got out of these Central India Stateseven though you pretend to
be correspondent of the Backwoodsman

Have you ever tried that trick I asked

Again and again but the Residents find you out and then you get
escorted to the Border before youve time to get your knife into them
But about my friend here I _must_ give him a word o mouth to tell him
whats come to me or else he wont know where to go I would take it
more than kind of you if you was to come out of Central India in time to
catch him at Marwar Junction and say to him He has gone South for the
week Hell know what that means Hes a big man with a red beard and
a great swell he is Youll find him sleeping like a gentleman with
all his luggage round him in a Secondclass apartment But dont you be
afraid Slip down the window and say He has gone South for the week
and hell tumble Its only cutting your time of stay in those parts
by two days I ask you as a strangergoing to the West he said with
emphasis

Where have _you_ come from said I

From the East said he and I am hoping that you will give him the
message on the Squarefor the sake of my Mother as well as your own

Englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their
mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent I saw
fit to agree

Its more than a little matter said he and thats why I asked
you to do itand now I know that I can depend on you doing it A
Secondclass carriage at Marwar Junction and a redhaired man asleep
in it Youll be sure to remember I get out at the next station and I
must hold on there till he comes or sends me what I want

Ill give the message if I catch him I said and for the sake of
your Mother as well as mine Ill give you a word of advice Dont try
to run the Central India States just now as the correspondent of the
Backwoodsman Theres a real one knocking about here and it might
lead to trouble

Thank you said he simply and when will the swine be gone I
cant starve because hes ruining my work I wanted to get hold of the
Degumber Rajah down here about his fathers widow and give him a jump

What did he do to his fathers widow then

Filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung
from a beam I found that out myself and Im the only man that would
dare going into the State to get hushmoney for it Theyll try to
poison me same as they did in Chortumna when I went on the loot there
But youll give the man at Marwar Junction my message

He got out at a little roadside station and I reflected I had heard
more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and
bleeding small Native States with threats of exposure but I had never
met any of the caste before They lead a hard life and generally die
with great suddenness The Native States have a wholesome horror of
English newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of
government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne
or drive them out of their mind with fourinhand barouches They do not
understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration
of Native States so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent
limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end
of the year to the other They are the dark places of the earth full
of unimaginable cruelty touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one
side and on the other the days of HarunalRaschid When I left the
train I did business with divers Kings and in eight days passed through
many changes of life Sometimes I wore dressclothes and consorted with
Princes and Politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver
Sometimes I lay out upon the ground and devoured what I could get from
a plate made of leaves and drank the running water and slept under the
same rug as my servant It was all in the days work

Then I headed for the Great Indian Desert upon the proper date as I
had promised and the night Mail set me down at Marwar Junction where
a funny little happygolucky nativemanaged railway runs to Jodhpore
The Bombay Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar She arrived
just as I got in and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go
down the carriages There was only one Secondclass on the train
I slipped the window and looked down upon a flamingred beard half
covered by a railwayrug That was my man fast asleep and I dug him
gently in the ribs He woke with a grunt and I saw his face in the
light of the lamps It was a great and shining face

Tickets again said he

No said I I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week He
has gone South for the week

The train had begun to move out The red man rubbed his eyes He
has gone South for the week he repeated Now thats just like his
impidence Did he say that I was to give you anything Cause I wont

He didnt I said and dropped away and watched the red lights die
out in the dark It was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off
the sands I climbed into my own trainnot an Intermediate carriage
this timeand went to sleep

If the man with the beard had given me a rupee I should have kept it as
a memento of a rather curious affair But the consciousness of having
done my duty was my only reward

Later on I reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any
good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers
and might if they blackmailed one of the little rattrap States
of Central India or Southern Rajputana get themselves into serious
difficulties I therefore took some trouble to describe them as
accurately as I could remember to people who would be interested in
deporting them and succeeded so I was later informed in having them
headed back from the Degumber borders

Then I became respectable and returned to an office where there were no
Kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper A
newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to
the prejudice of discipline Zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that
the Editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian
prizegiving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village
Colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the
outline of a series of ten twelve or twentyfour leading articles on
Seniority _versus_ Selection missionaries wish to know why they have
not been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse and
swear at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial
We stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot
pay for their advertisements but on their return from New Zealand
or Tahiti will do so with interest inventors of patent punkapulling
machines carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call
with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal tea
companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens
secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last
dance more fully described strange ladies rustle in and say I want
a hundred ladys cards printed _at once_ please which is manifestly
part of an Editors duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped
the Grand Trunk Road makes it his business to ask for employment as a
proofreader And all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly
and Kings are being killed on the Continent and Empires are saying
Youre another and Mister Gladstone is calling down brimstone upon
the British Dominions and the little black copyboys are whining
_kaapi chayhayeh_ Copy wanted like tired bees and most of the
paper is as blank as Modreds shield

But that is the amusing part of the year There are six other months
when none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch
up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above
readinglight and the pressmachines are redhot to touch and nobody
writes anything but accounts of amusements in the Hillstations or
obituary notices Then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because
it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew
intimately and the prickly heat covers you with a garment and you
sit down and write A slight increase of sickness is reported from
the Khuda Janta Khan District The outbreak is purely sporadic in
its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the District
authorities is now almost at an end It is however with deep regret
we record the death etc

Then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and
reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers But the Empires
and the Kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and
the Foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in
twentyfour hours and all the people at the Hillstations in the
middle of their amusements say Good gracious why cant the paper be
sparkling Im sure theres plenty going on up here

That is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say must
be experienced to be appreciated

It was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper
began running the last issue of the week on Saturday night which is to
say Sunday morning after the custom of a London paper This was a great
convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn
would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for
half an hour and in that chillyou have no idea how cold is 84 degrees
on the grass until you begin to pray for ita very tired man could get
off to sleep ere the heat roused him

One Saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed
alone A King or courtier or a courtesan or a Community was going to
die or get a new Constitution or do something that was important on
the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the
latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram

It was a pitchyblack night as stifling as a June night can be and
the _loo_ the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the
tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels Now and
again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the
flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence It
was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so I sat there
while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the
windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their
foreheads and called for water The thing that was keeping us back
whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last
type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat
with its finger on its lip to wait the event I drowsed and wondered
whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or
struggling people might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was
causing There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make
tension but as the clockhands crept up to three oclock and the
machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was
in order before I said the word that would set them off I could have
shrieked aloud

Then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little
bits I rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front
of me The first one said Its him The second said So it is And
they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped
their foreheads We seed there was a light burning across the road
and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and I said to my
friend here The office is open Lets come along and speak to him as
turned us back from Degumber State said the smaller of the two
He was the man I had met in the Mhow train and his fellow was the
redbearded man of Marwar Junction There was no mistaking the eyebrows
of the one or the beard of the other

I was not pleased because I wished to go to sleep not to squabble with
loafers What do you want I asked

Half an hours talk with you cool and comfortable in the office
said the redbearded man Wed _like_ some drinkthe Contrack doesnt
begin yet Peachey so you neednt lookbut what we really want is
advice We dont want money We ask you as a favour because we found
out you did us a bad turn about Degumber State

I led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the
walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands Thats something
like said he This was the proper shop to come to Now Sir let
me introduce you to Brother Peachey Carnehan thats him and Brother
Daniel Dravot that is _me_ and the less said about our professions
the better for we have been most things in our timesoldier
sailor compositor photographer proofreader streetpreacher and
correspondents of the Backwoodsman when we thought the paper wanted
one Carnehan is sober and so am I Look at us first and see thats
sure It will save you cutting into my talk Well take one of your
cigars apiece and you shall see us light up

I watched the test The men were absolutely sober so I gave them each a
tepid whiskyandsoda

Well _and_ good said Carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth
from his moustache Let me talk now Dan We have been all over India
mostly on foot We have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty
contractors and all that and we have decided that India isnt big
enough for such as us

They certainly were too big for the office Dravots beard seemed to
fill half the room and Carnehans shoulders the other half as they sat
on the big table Carnehan continued The country isnt half worked
out because they that governs it wont let you touch it They spend all
their blessed time in governing it and you cant lift a spade nor
chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the
Government saying Leave it alone and let us govern Therefore such
_as_ it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where
a man isnt crowded and can come to his own We are not little men and
there is nothing that we are afraid of except Drink and we have signed
a Contrack on that _Therefore_ we are going away to be Kings

Kings in our own right muttered Dravot

Yes of course I said Youve been tramping in the sun and its
a very warm night and hadnt you better sleep over the notion Come
tomorrow

Neither drunk nor sunstruck said Dravot We have slept over the
notion half a year and require to see Books and Atlases and we have
decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong
men can Sara_whack_ They call it Kafiristan By my reckoning its the
top righthand corner of Afghanistan not more than three hundred miles
from Peshawar They have two and thirty heathen idols there and well
be the thirtythird and fourth Its a mountaineous country the women
of those parts are very beautiful

But that is provided against in the Contrack said Carnehan Neither
Women nor Liquor Daniel

And thats all we know except that no one has gone there and they
fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill
men can always be a King We shall go to those parts and say to any King
we find D you want to vanquish your foes and we will show him how
to drill men for that we know better than anything else Then we will
subvert that King and seize his Throne and establish a Dynasty

Youll be cut to pieces before youre fifty miles across the Border
I said You have to travel through Afghanistan to get to that country
Its one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no Englishman has
been through it The people are utter brutes and even if you reached
them you couldnt do anything

Thats more like said Carnehan If you could think us a little more
mad we would be more pleased We have come to you to know about this
country to read a book about it and to be shown maps We want you to
tell us that we are fools and to show us your books He turned to the
bookcases

Are you at all in earnest I said

A little said Dravot sweetly As big a map as you have got even
if its all blank where Kafiristan is and any books youve got We can
read though we arent very educated

I uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of India and two
smaller Frontier maps hauled down volume INFKAN of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica and the men consulted them

See here said Dravot his thumb on the map Up to Jagdallak Peachey
and me know the road We was there with Roberts Army Well have to
turn off to the right at Jagdallak through Laghmann territory Then we
get among the hillsfourteen thousand feetfifteen thousandit will
be cold work there but it dont look very far on the map

I handed him Wood on the Sources of the Oxus Carnehan was deep in the
Encyclopaedia

Theyre a mixed lot said Dravot reflectively and it wont help
us to know the names of their tribes The more tribes the more theyll
fight and the better for us From Jagdallak to Ashang Hmm

But all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate
as can be I protested No one knows anything about it really Heres
the file of the United Services Institute Read what Bellew says

Blow Bellew said Carnehan Dan theyre a stinkin lot of heathens
but this book here says they think theyre related to us English

I smoked while the men poured over Raverty Wood the maps and the
Encyclopaedia

There is no use your waiting said Dravot politely Its about four
oclock now Well go before six oclock if you want to sleep and we
wont steal any of the papers Dont you sit up Were two harmless
lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the Serai well say
goodbye to you

You _are_ two fools I answered Youll be turned back at the
Frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in Afghanistan Do you want
any money or a recommendation downcountry I can help you to the chance
of work next week

Next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you said Dravot
It isnt so easy being a King as it looks When weve got our Kingdom
in going order well let you know and you can come up and help us
govern it

Would two lunatics make a Contrack like that said Carnehan with
subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was
written the following I copied it then and there as a curiosity

 This Contracx between me and you persuing witnesseth in
 the name of GodAmen and so forth

 One That me and you will settle this matter
 together ie to be Kings of Kafiristan

 Two That you and me will not while this
 matter is being settled look at any
 Liquor nor any Woman black white
 or brown so as to get mixed up with
 one or the other harmful

 Three That we conduct ourselves with Dignity
 and Discretion and if one of us gets
 into trouble the other will stay by him

 Signed by you and me this day
 Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan
 Daniel Dravot
 Both Gentlemen at Large

There was no need for the last article said Carnehan blushing
modestly but it looks regular Now you know the sort of men that
loafers arewe _are_ loafers Dan until we get out of Indiaand
_do_ you think that we would sign a Contrack like that unless we was
in earnest We have kept away from the two things that make life worth
having

You wont enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this
idiotic adventure Dont set the office on fire I said and go away
before nine oclock

I left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back
of the Contrack Be sure to come down to the Serai tomorrow were
their parting words

The Kumharsen Serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the
strings of camels and horses from the North load and unload All the
nationalities of Central Asia may be found there and most of the folk
of India proper Balkh and Bokhara there meet Bengal and Bombay and try
to draw eyeteeth You can buy ponies turquoises Persian pussycats
saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the Kumharsen Serai and get
many strange things for nothing In the afternoon I went down to see
whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there
drunk

A priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me
gravely twisting a childs paper whirligig Behind him was his servant
bending under the load of a crate of mud toys The two were loading up
two camels and the inhabitants of the Serai watched them with shrieks
of laughter

The priest is mad said a horsedealer to me He is going up to Kabul
to sell toys to the Amir He will either be raised to honour or have his
head cut off He came in here this morning and has been behaving madly
ever since

The witless are under the protection of God stammered a flatcheeked
Usbeg in broken Hindi They foretell future events

Would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up
by the Shinwaris almost within shadow of the Pass grunted the Eusufzai
agent of a Rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been diverted into
the hands of other robbers just across the Border and whose misfortunes
were the laughingstock of the bazaar Ohe priest whence come you and
whither do you go

From Roum have I come shouted the priest waving his whirligig from
Roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea O thieves
robbers liars the blessing of Pir Khan on pigs dogs and perjurers
Who will take the Protected of God to the North to sell charms that are
never still to the Amir The camels shall not gall the sons shall not
fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away
of the men who give me place in their caravan Who will assist me to
slipper the King of the Roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel
The protection of Pir Khan be upon his labours He spread out the
skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered
horses

There starts a caravan from Peshawar to Kabul in twenty days
_Huzrut_ said the Eusufzai trader My camels go therewith Do thou
also go and bring us good luck

I will go even now shouted the priest I will depart upon my winged
camels and be at Peshawar in a day Ho Hazar Mir Khan he yelled to
his servant drive out the camels but let me first mount my own

He leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to
me cried Come thou also Sahib a little along the road and I will
sell thee a charman amulet that shall make thee King of Kafiristan

Then the light broke upon me and I followed the two camels out of the
Serai till we reached open road and the priest halted

What d you think o that said he in English Carnehan cant talk
their patter so Ive made him my servant He makes a handsome servant
T isnt for nothing that Ive been knocking about the country for
fourteen years Didnt I do that talk neat Well hitch on to a caravan
at Peshawar till we get to Jagdallak and then well see if we can get
donkeys for our camels and strike into Kafiristan Whirligigs for the
Amir O Lor Put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you
feel

I felt the butt of a Martini and another and another

Twenty of em said Dravot placidly Twenty of em and ammunition to
correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls

Heaven help you if you are caught with those things I said A
Martini is worth her weight in silver among the Pathans

Fifteen hundred rupees of capitalevery rupee we could beg borrow
or stealare invested on these two camels said Dravot We wont get
caught Were going through the Khaiber with a regular caravan Whod
touch a poor mad priest

Have you got everything you want I asked overcome with astonishment

Not yet but we shall soon Give us a momento of your kindness
_Brother_ You did me a service yesterday and that time in Marwar Half
my Kingdom shall you have as the saying is I slipped a small charm
compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest

Goodbye said Dravot giving me hand cautiously Its the last time
well shake hands with an Englishman these many days Shake hands with
him Carnehan he cried as the second camel passed me

Carnehan leaned down and shook hands Then the camels passed away along
the dusty road and I was left alone to wonder My eye could detect no
failure in the disguises The scene in the Serai proved that they were
complete to the native mind There was just the chance therefore that
Carnehan and Dravot would be able to wander through Afghanistan without
detection But beyond they would find deathcertain and awful death

Ten days later a native correspondent giving me the news of the day
from Peshawar wound up his letter with There has been much laughter
here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation
to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as
great charms to H H the Amir of Bokhara He passed through Peshawar
and associated himself to the Second Summer caravan that goes to Kabul
The merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that
such mad fellows bring good fortune

The two then were beyond the Border I would have prayed for them but
that night a real King died in Europe and demanded an obituary notice


The wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again
Summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again The
daily paper continued and I with it and upon the third summer there
fell a hot night a night issue and a strained waiting for something to
be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened
before A few great men had died in the past two years the machines
worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden
were a few feet taller But that was all the difference

I passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as
I have already described The nervous tension was stronger than it
had been two years before and I felt the heat more acutely At three
oclock I cried Print off and turned to go when there crept to my
chair what was left of a man He was bent into a circle his head was
sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other
like a bear I could hardly see whether he walked or crawledthis
ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he
was come back Can you give me a drink he whimpered For the Lords
sake give me a drink

I went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and I
turned up the lamp

Dont you know me he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his
drawn face surmounted by a shock of gray hair to the light

I looked at him intently Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over
the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me I could not
tell where

I dont know you I said handing him the whisky What can I do for
you

He took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the
suffocating heat

Ive come back he repeated and I was the King of Kafiristanme and
Dravotcrowned Kings we was In this office we settled ityou setting
there and giving us the books I am PeacheyPeachey Taliaferro
Carnehanand youve been setting here ever sinceO Lord

I was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings
accordingly

Its true said Carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which
were wrapped in ragstrue as gospel Kings we were with crowns upon
our headsme and Dravotpoor Danoh poor poor Dan that would never
take advice not though I begged of him

Take the whisky I said and take your own time Tell me all you can
recollect of everything from beginning to end You got across the Border
on your camels Dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant Do
you remember that

I aint madyet but I shall be that way soon Of course I remember
Keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces Keep
looking at me in my eyes and dont say anything

I leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as I could He
dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist It
was twisted like a birds claw and upon the back was a ragged red
diamondshaped scar

No dont look there Look at _me_ said Carnehan That comes
afterward but for the Lords sake dont distrack me We left with that
caravan me and Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people
we were with Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the
people was cooking their dinnerscooking their dinners and   
what did they do then They lit little fires with sparks that went into
Dravots beard and we all laughedfit to die Little red fires they
was going into Dravots big red beardso funny His eyes left mine
and he smiled foolishly

You went as far as Jagdallak with that caravan I said at a venture
after you had lit those fires To Jagdallak where you turned off to
try to get into Kafiristan

No we didnt neither What are you talking about We turned off
before Jagdallak because we heard the roads was good But they wasnt
good enough for our two camelsmine and Dravots When we left the
caravan Dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would
be heathen because the Kafirs didnt allow Mohammedans to talk to them
So we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as Daniel Dravot
I never saw yet nor expect to see again He burned half his beard and
slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns
He shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like
a heathen That was in a most mountaineous country and our camels
couldnt go along any more because of the mountains They were tall and
black and coming home I saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lots
of goats in Kafiristan And these mountains they never keep still no
more than the goats Always fighting they are and dont let you sleep
at night

Take some more whisky I said very slowly What did you and Daniel
Dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads
that led into Kafiristan

What did which do There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan
that was with Dravot Shall I tell you about him He died out there in
the cold Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey turning and twisting in
the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir No they
was two for three hapence those whirligigs or I am much mistaken and
woful sore    And then these camels were no use and Peachey said to
Dravot For the Lords sake lets get out of this before our heads
are chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among the
mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took
off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along
driving four mules Dravot up and dances in front of them singing
Sell me four mules Says the first man If you are rich enough to
buy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his hand
to his knife Dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party
runs away So Carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken
off the camels and together we starts forward into those bittercold
mountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of your
hand

He paused for a moment while I asked him if he could remember the
nature of the country through which he had journeyed

I am telling you as straight as I can but my head isnt as good as it
might be They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot
died The country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary
and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary They went up and up and
down and down and that other party Carnehan was imploring of Dravot
not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus
avalanches But Dravot says that if a King couldnt sing it wasnt worth
being King and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no
heed for ten cold days We came to a big level valley all among the
mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having
anything in special for them or us to eat We sat upon the boxes and
played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out

Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty
men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus They was fair
menfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and remarkable well built
Says Dravot unpacking the guns This is the beginning of the business
Well fight for the ten men and with that he fires two rifles at the
twenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock
where he was sitting The other men began to run but Carnehan and
Dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down the
valley Then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too
and they fires a footy little arrow at us Dravot he shoots above their
heads and they all falls down flat Then he walks over them and kicks
them and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them
friendly like He calls them and gives them the boxes to carry and
waves his hand for all the world as though he was King already They
takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine
wood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols Dravot
he goes to the biggesta fellow they call Imbraand lays a rifle and
a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectfuly with his own nose
patting him on the head and nods his head and says Thats all right
Im in the know too and these old jimjams are my friends Then he
opens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings him
food he says No and when the second man brings him food he says
no but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings
him food he says Yes very haughty and eats it slow That was how
he came to our first village without any trouble just as though we
had tumbled from the skies But we tumbled from one of those damned
ropebridges you see andyou couldnt expect a man to laugh much
after that

Take some more whisky and go on I said That was the first village
you came into How did you get to be King

I wasnt King said Carnehan Dravot he was the King and a handsome
man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all Him and the other
party stayed in that village and every morning Dravot sat by the side
of old Imbra and the people came and worshipped That was Dravots
order Then a lot of men came into the valley and Carnehan Dravot picks
them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down
into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village
same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their
faces and Dravot says Now what is the trouble between you two
villages and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that
was carried off and Dravot takes her back to the first village and
counts up the deadeight there was For each dead man Dravot pours
a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and
Thats all right says he Then he and Carnehan takes the big boss of
each village by the arm and walks them down the valley and shows them
how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each
a sod of turf from both sides of the line Then all the people comes
down and shouts like the devil and all and Dravot says Go and dig the
land and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didnt
understand Then we asks the names of things in their lingobread and
water and fire and idols and such and Dravot leads the priest of each
village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people
and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot

Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as
bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and
told Dravot in dumbshow what it was about Thats just the beginning
says Dravot They think were Gods He and Carnehan picks out twenty
good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and
advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see
the hang of it Then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and
leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to
see what was to be done in the next valley That was all rock and there
was a little village there and Carnehan says Send em to the old
valley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land that
wasnt took before They were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kid
before letting em into the new Kingdom That was to impress the people
and then they settled down quiet and Carnehan went back to Dravot who
had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous
There was no people there and the Army got afraid so Dravot shoots
one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the
Army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better
not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks We makes
friends with the priest and I stays there alone with two of the Army
teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big Chief comes across
the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was
a new God kicking about Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half
a mile across the snow and wings one of them Then he sends a message
to the Chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake
hands with me and leave his arms behind The Chief comes alone first
and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as
Dravot used and very much surprised that Chief was and strokes
my eyebrows Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief and asks him in
dumbshow if he had an enemy he hated I have says the chief So
Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the Army to
show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about
as well as Volunteers So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain
on the top of a mountain and the Chiefs men rushes into a village and
takes it we three Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy So we
took that village too and I gives the Chief a rag from my coat and
says Occupy till I come which was scriptural By way of a reminder
when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away I drops a bullet
near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their
faces Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever he be by land or by
sea

At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted How
could you write a letter up yonder

The letterohthe letter Keep looking at me between the eyes
please It was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of it
from a blind beggar in the Punjab

I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with
a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig
according to some cipher of his own He could after the lapse of days
or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up He had reduced the
alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his method
but I could not understand

I sent that letter to Dravot said Carnehan and told him to come
back because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then
I struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working They
called the village we took along with the Chief Bashkai and the first
village we took ErHeb The priests at ErHeb was doing all right but
they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from
another village had been firing arrows at night I went out and looked
for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards
That used all the cartridges I cared to spend and I waited for Dravot
who had been away two or three months and I kept my people quiet

One morning I heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and Dan
Dravot marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of
men and which was the most amazing a great gold crown on his head
My Gord Carnehan says Daniel this is a tremenjus business and
weve got the whole country as far as its worth having I am the son
of Alexander by Queen Semiramis and youre my younger brother and a
God too Its the biggest thing weve ever seen Ive been marching and
fighting for six weeks with the Army and every footy little village for
fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that Ive got the key
of the whole show as youll see and Ive got a crown for you I told
em to make two of em at a place called Shu where the gold lies in the
rock like suet in mutton Gold Ive seen and turquoise Ive kicked out
of the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heres
a chunk of amber that a man brought me Call up all the priests and
here take your crown

One of the men opens a black hair bag and I slips the crown on It was
too small and too heavy but I wore it for the glory Hammered gold it
wasfive pounds weight like a hoop of a barrel

Peachey says Dravot we dont want to fight no more The Crafts
the trick so help me and he brings forward that same Chief that I
left at BashkaiBilly Fish we called him afterward because he was so
like Billy Fish that drove the big tankengine at Mach on the Bolan in
the old days Shake hands with him says Dravot and I shook hands
and nearly dropped for Billy Fish gave me the Grip I said nothing but
tried him with the Fellowcraft Grip He answers all right and I tried
the Masters Grip but that was a slip A Fellowcraft he is I says
to Dan Does he know the word He does says Dan and all the
priests know Its a miracle The Chiefs and the priests can work a
Fellowcraft Lodge in a way thats very like ours and theyve cut the
marks on the rocks but they dont know the Third Degree and theyve
come to find out Its Gords Truth Ive known these long years that
the Afghans knew up to the Fellowcraft Degree but this is a miracle
A God and a Grand Master of the Craft am I and a Lodge in the Third
Degree I will open and well raise the head priests and the Chiefs of
the villages

Its against all the law I says holding a Lodge without warrant
from any one and you know we never held office in any Lodge

Its a master stroke o policy says Dravot It means running the
country as easy as a fourwheeled bogie on a down grade We cant stop
to inquire now or theyll turn against us Ive forty Chiefs at my
heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be
Billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a Lodge of some
kind The temple of Imbra will do for a Lodgeroom The women must make
aprons as you show them Ill hold a levee of Chiefs tonight and Lodge
tomorrow

I was fair run off my legs but I wasnt such a fool as not to see what
a pull this Craft business gave us I showed the priests families how
to make aprons of the degrees but for Dravots apron the blue border
and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth We took
a great square stone in the temple for the Masters chair and little
stones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement with
white squares and did what we could to make things regular

At the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big
bonfires Dravot gives out that him and me were Gods and sons of
Alexander and Passed Grand Masters in the Craft and was come to make
Kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in
quiet and specially obey us Then the Chiefs come round to shake hands
and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with
old friends We gave them names according as they was like men we had
known in IndiaBilly Fish Holly Dilworth Pikky Kergan that was
Bazaarmaster when I was at Mhow and so on and so on

_The_ most amazing miracles was at Lodge next night One of the old
priests was watching us continuous and I felt uneasy for I knew wed
have to fudge the Ritual and I didnt know what the men knew The old
priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of Bashkai The
minute Dravot puts on the Masters apron that the girls had made for
him the priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the
stone that Dravot was sitting on Its all up now I says That comes
of meddling with the Craft without warrant Dravot never winked an
eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the Grand Masters
chairwhich was to say the stone of Imbra The priest begins rubbing
the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he
shows all the other priests the Masters Mark same as was on Dravots
apron cut into the stone Not even the priests of the temple of Imbra
knew it was there The old chap falls flat on his face at Dravots feet
and kisses em Luck again says Dravot across the Lodge to me
they say its the missing Mark that no one could understand the why of
Were more than safe now Then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel
and says By virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right
hand and the help of Peachey I declare myself Grand Master of all
Freemasonry in Kafiristan in this the Mother Lodge o the country and
King of Kafiristan equally with Peachey At that he puts on his crown
and I puts on mineI was doing Senior Wardenand we opens the Lodge
in most ample form It was an amazing miracle The priests moved in
Lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the
memory was coming back to them After that Peachey and Dravot raised
such as was worthyhigh priests and Chiefs of faroff villages Billy
Fish was the first and I can tell you we scared the soul out of him
It was not in any way according to Ritual but it served our turn We
didnt raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didnt want to
make the Degree common And they was clamouring to be raised

In another six months says Dravot well hold another Communication
and see how you are working Then he asks them about their villages
and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were sick
and tired of it And when they wasnt doing that they was fighting with
the Mohammedans You can fight those when they come into our country
says Dravot Tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a Frontier
guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled
Nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well
and I know that you wont cheat me because youre white peoplesons of
Alexanderand not like common black Mohammedans You are _my_ people
and by God says he running off into English at the end Ill make a
damned fine Nation of you or Ill die in the making

I cant tell all we did for the next six months because Dravot did a
lot I couldnt see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way I
never could My work was to help the people plough and now and again
go out with some of the Army and see what the other villages were doing
and make em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the
country horrid Dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and
down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both
fists I knew he was thinking plans I could not advise about and I just
waited for orders

But Dravot never showed me disrespect before the people They were
afraid of me and the Army but they loved Dan He was the best of
friends with the priests and the Chiefs but any one could come across
the hills with a complaint and Dravot would hear him out fair and call
four priests together and say what was to be done He used to call in
Billy Fish from Bashkai and Pikky Kergan from Shu and an old Chief
we called Kafuzelumit was like enough to his real nameand hold
councils with em when there was any fighting to be done in small
villages That was his Council of War and the four priests of Bashkai
Shu Khawak and Madora was his Privy Council Between the lot of em
they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men carrying
turquoises into the Ghorband country to buy those handmade Martini
rifles that come out of the Amirs workshops at Kabul from one of the
Amirs Herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their
mouths for turquoises

I stayed in Ghorband a month and gave the Governor there the pick of
my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the Colonel of the regiment some
more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a
hundred handmade Martinis a hundred good Kohat Jezails thatll throw
to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for the
rifles I came back with what I had and distributed em among the men
that the Chiefs sent in to me to drill Dravot was too busy to attend
to those things but the old Army that we first made helped me and we
turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred that knew
how to hold arms pretty straight Even those corkscrewed handmade
guns was a miracle to them Dravot talked big about powdershops and
factories walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was
coming on

I wont make a Nation says he Ill make an Empire These men
arent niggers theyre English Look at their eyeslook at their
mouths Look at the way they stand up They sit on chairs in their own
houses Theyre the Lost Tribes or something like it and theyve grown
to be English Ill take a census in the spring if the priests dont get
frightened There must be a fair two million of em in these hills The
villages are full o little children Two million peopletwo hundred
and fifty thousand fighting menand all English They only want the
rifles and a little drilling Two hundred and fifty thousand men ready
to cut in on Russias right flank when she tries for India Peachey
man he says chewing his beard in great hunks we shall be
EmperorsEmperors of the Earth Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to
us Ill treat with the Viceroy on equal terms Ill ask him to send me
twelve picked Englishtwelve that I know ofto help us govern a bit
Theres Mackray Serjeant Pensioner at Segowlimanys the good dinner
hes given me and his wife a pair of trousers Theres Donkin the
Warder of Tounghoo Jail theres hundreds that I could lay my hand on if
I was in India The Viceroy shall do it for me Ill send a man through
in the spring for those men and Ill write for a dispensation from
the Grand Lodge for what Ive done as Grand Master Thatand all the
Sniders thatll be thrown out when the native troops in India take up
the Martini Theyll be worn smooth but theyll do for fighting in
these hills Twelve English a hundred thousand Sniders run through the
Amirs country in dribletsId be content with twenty thousand in one
yearand wed be an Empire When everything was shipshape Id hand
over the crownthis crown Im wearing nowto Queen Victoria on my
knees and shed say Rise up Sir Daniel Dravot Oh its big Its
big I tell you But theres so much to be done in every placeBashkai
Khawak Shu and everywhere else

What is it I says There are no more men coming in to be drilled
this autumn Look at those fat black clouds Theyre bringing the snow

It isnt that says Daniel putting his hand very hard on my
shoulder and I dont wish to say anything thats against you for no
other living man would have followed me and made me what I am as you
have done Youre a firstclass CommanderinChief and the people know
you butits a big country and somehow you cant help me Peachey in
the way I want to be helped

Go to your blasted priests then I said and I was sorry when I made
that remark but it did hurt me sore to find Daniel talking so superior
when Id drilled all the men and done all he told me

Dont lets quarrel Peachey says Daniel without cursing Youre
a King too and the half of this Kingdom is yours but cant you see
Peachey we want cleverer men than us nowthree or four of em that
we can scatter about for our Deputies Its a hugeous great State and
I cant always tell the right thing to do and I havent time for all
I want to do and heres the winter coming on and all He put half his
beard into his mouth all red like the gold of his crown

Im sorry Daniel says I Ive done all I could Ive drilled
the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and Ive
brought in those tinware rifles from Ghorbandbut I know what youre
driving at I take it Kings always feel oppressed that way

Theres another thing too says Dravot walking up and down The
winters coming and these people wont be giving much trouble and if
they do we cant move about I want a wife

For Gords sake leave the women alone I says Weve both got all
the work we can though I _am_ a fool Remember the Contrack and keep
clear o women

The Contrack only lasted till such time as we was Kings and Kings
we have been these months past says Dravot weighing his crown in his
hand You go get a wife too Peacheya nice strappin plump girl
thatll keep you warm in the winter Theyre prettier than English
girls and we can take the pick of em Boil em once or twice in hot
water and theyll come out like chicken and ham

Dont tempt me I says I will not have any dealings with a woman
not till we are a dam side more settled than we are now Ive been
doing the work o two men and youve been doing the work of three
Lets lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from
Afghan country and run in some good liquor and no women

Whos talking o _women_ says Dravot I said _wife_a Queen to
breed a Kings son for the King A Queen out of the strongest tribe
thatll make them your bloodbrothers and thatll lie by your side and
tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs Thats
what I want

Do you remember that Bengali woman I kept at Mogul Serai when I was
a platelayer says I A fat lot o good she was to me She taught me
the lingo and one or two other things but what happened She ran away
with the Stationmasters servant and half my months pay Then
she turned up at Dadur Junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the
impidence to say I was her husbandall among the drivers in the
runningshed too

Weve done with that says Dravot these women are whiter than you
or me and a Queen I will have for the winter months

For the last time o asking Dan do _not_ I says Itll only bring
us harm The Bible says that Kings aint to waste their strength on
women specially when theyve got a new raw Kingdom to work over

For the last time of answering I will said Dravot and he went away
through the pinetrees looking like a big red devil the sun being on
his crown and beard and all

But getting a wife was not as easy as Dan thought He put it before the
Council and there was no answer till Billy Fish said that hed better
ask the girls Dravot damned them all round Whats wrong with me he
shouts standing by the idol Imbra Am I a dog or am I not enough of
a man for your wenches Havent I put the shadow of my hand over this
country Who stopped the last Afghan raid It was me really but Dravot
was too angry to remember Who bought your guns Who repaired the
bridges Whos the Grand Master of the sign cut in the stone says he
and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in Lodge
and at Council which opened like Lodge always Billy Fish said nothing
and no more did the others Keep your hair on Dan said I and ask
the girls Thats how its done at Home and these people are quite
English

The marriage of the King is a matter of State says Dan in a
whitehot rage for he could feel I hope that he was going against
his better mind He walked out of the Councilroom and the others sat
still looking at the ground

Billy Fish says I to the Chief of Bashkai whats the difficulty
here A straight answer to a true friend

You know says Billy Fish How should a man tell you who knows
everything How can daughters of men marry Gods or Devils Its not
proper

I remembered something like that in the Bible but if after seeing us
as long as they had they still believed we were Gods it wasnt for me
to undeceive them

A God can do anything says I If the King is fond of a girl hell
not let her die Shell have to said Billy Fish There are all
sorts of Gods and Devils in these mountains and now and again a girl
marries one of them and isnt seen any more Besides you two know the
Mark cut in the stone Only the Gods know that We thought you were men
till you showed the sign of the Master

I wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine
secrets of a Master Mason at the first gooff but I said nothing All
that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway
down the hill and I heard the girl crying fit to die One of the
priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the King

Ill have no nonsense of that kind says Dan I dont want to
interfere with your customs but Ill take my own wife The girls a
little bit afraid says the priest She thinks shes going to die and
they are aheartening of her up down in the temple

Hearten her very tender then says Dravot or Ill hearten you with
the butt of a gun so youll never want to be heartened again He licked
his lips did Dan and stayed up walking about more than half the night
thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning I wasnt
any means comfortable for I knew that dealings with a woman in foreign
parts though you was a crowned King twenty times over could not but be
risky I got up very early in the morning while Dravot was asleep and
I saw the priests talking together in whispers and the Chiefs talking
together too and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes

What is up Fish I say to the Bashkai man who was wrapped up in his
furs and looking splendid to behold

I cant rightly say says he but if you can make the King drop all
this nonsense about marriage youll be doing him and me and yourself a
great service

That I do believe says I But sure you know Billy as well as me
having fought against and for us that the King and me are nothing more
than two of the finest men that God Almighty ever made Nothing more I
do assure you

That may be says Billy Fish and yet I should be sorry if it was
He sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks
King says he be you man or God or Devil Ill stick by you today
I have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me Well go to
Bashkai until the storm blows over

A little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except
the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north Dravot
came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his
feet and looking more pleased than Punch

For the last time drop it Dan says I in a whisper Billy Fish
here says that there will be a row

A row among my people says Dravot Not much Peachey youre a fool
not to get a wife too Wheres the girl says he with a voice as loud
as the braying of a jackass Call up all the Chiefs and priests and
let the Emperor see if his wife suits him

There was no need to call any one They were all there leaning on their
guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood A lot
of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the
horns blew fit to wake the dead Billy Fish saunters round and gets as
close to Daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with
matchlocksnot a man of them under six feet I was next to Dravot and
behind me was twenty men of the regular Army Up comes the girl and a
strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white
as death and looking back every minute at the priests

Shell do said Dan looking her over Whats to be afraid of lass
Come and kiss me He puts his arm round her She shuts her eyes
gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of Dans
flamingred beard

The sluts bitten me says he clapping his hand to his neck and
sure enough his hand was red with blood Billy Fish and two of his
matchlock men catches hold of Dan by the shoulders and drags him into
the Bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingo Neither God
nor Devil but a man I was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in
front and the Army behind began firing into the Bashkai men

God Amighty says Dan what is the meaning o this

Come back Come away says Billy Fish Ruin and Mutiny is the
matter Well break for Bashkai if we can

I tried to give some sort of orders to my menthe men o the regular
Armybut it was no use so I fired into the brown of em with an
English Martini and drilled three beggars in a line The valley was full
of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking Not a God
nor a Devil but only a man The Bashkai troops stuck to Billy Fish all
they were worth but their matchlocks wasnt half as good as the Kabul
breechloaders and four of them dropped Dan was bellowing like a bull
for he was very wrathy and Billy Fish had a hard job to prevent him
running out at the crowd

We cant stand says Billy Fish Make a run for it down the valley
The whole place is against us The matchlockmen ran and we went down
the valley in spite of Dravot He was swearing horrible and crying
out that he was a King The priests rolled great stones on us and
the regular Army fired hard and there wasnt more than six men not
counting Dan Billy Fish and Me that came down to the bottom of the
valley alive

Then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again Come
awayfor Gords sake come away says Billy Fish Theyll send runners
out to all the villages before ever we get to Bashkai I can protect you
there but I cant do anything now

My own notion is that Dan began to go mad in his head from that hour
He stared up and down like a stuck pig Then he was all for walking back
alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have
done An Emperor am I says Daniel and next year I shall be a Knight
of the Queen

All right Dan says I but come along now while theres time

Its your fault says he for not looking after your Army better
There was mutiny in the midst and you didnt knowyou damned
enginedriving platelaying missionaryspasshunting hound He sat
upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to I was
too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought
the smash

Im sorry Dan says I but theres no accounting for natives This
business is our Fiftyseven Maybe well make something out of it yet
when weve got to Bashkai

Lets get to Bashkai then says Dan and by God when I come
back here again Ill sweep the valley so there isnt a bug in a blanket
left

We walked all that day and all that night Dan was stumping up and down
on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself

Theres no hope o getting clear said Billy Fish The priests have
sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men Why didnt
you stick on as Gods till things was more settled Im a dead man says
Billy Fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to
his Gods

Next morning we was in a cruel bad countryall up and down no level
ground at all and no food either The six Bashkai men looked at Billy
Fish hungryway as if they wanted to ask something but they never said
a word At noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with
snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an Army in
position waiting in the middle

The runners have been very quick says Billy Fish with a little bit
of a laugh They are waiting for us

Three or four men began to fire from the enemys side and a chance
shot took Daniel in the calf of the leg That brought him to his senses
He looks across the snow at the Army and sees the rifles that we had
brought into the country

Were done for says he They are Englishmen these peopleand
its my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this Get back Billy
Fish and take your men away youve done what you could and now cut
for it Carnehan says he shake hands with me and go along with
Billy Maybe they wont kill you Ill go and meet em alone Its me
that did it Me the King

Go says I Go to Hell Dan Im with you here Billy Fish you
clear out and we two will meet those folk

Im a Chief says Billy Fish quite quiet I stay with you My men
can go

The Bashkai fellows didnt wait for a second word but ran off and Dan
and Me and Billy Fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and
the horns were horning It was coldawful cold Ive got that cold in
the back of my head now Theres a lump of it there

The punkacoolies had gone to sleep Two kerosene lamps were blazing in
the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the
blotter as I leaned forward Carnehan was shivering and I feared that
his mind might go I wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously
mangled hands and said What happened after that

The momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current

What was you pleased to say whined Carnehan They took them without
any sound Not a little whisper all along the snow not though the King
knocked down the first man that set hand on himnot though old Peachey
fired his last cartridge into the brown of em Not a single solitary
sound did those swines make They just closed up tight and I tell you
their furs stunk There was a man called Billy Fish a good friend of us
all and they cut his throat Sir then and there like a pig and the
King kicks up the bloody snow and says Weve had a dashed fine run for
our money Whats coming next But Peachey Peachey Taliaferro I tell
you Sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head Sir
No he didnt neither The King lost his head so he did all along o
one of those cunning rope bridges Kindly let me have the papercutter
Sir It tilted this way They marched him a mile across that snow to a
rope bridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom You may have seen
such They prodded him behind like an ox Damn your eyes says
the King D you suppose I cant die like a gentleman He turns to
PeacheyPeachey that was crying like a child Ive brought you to
this Peachey says he Brought you out of your happy life to be
killed in Kafiristan where you was late CommanderinChief of the
Emperors forces Say you forgive me Peachey I do says Peachey
Fully and freely do I forgive you Dan Shake hands Peachey says
he Im going now Out he goes looking neither right nor left and
when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes Cut you
beggars he shouts and they cut and old Dan fell turning round and
round and round twenty thousand miles for he took half an hour to fall
till he struck the water and I could see his body caught on a rock with
the gold crown close beside

But do you know what they did to Peachey between two pinetrees They
crucified him Sir as Peacheys hand will show They used wooden pegs
for his hands and feet but he didnt die He hung there and screamed
and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he
wasnt dead They took him downpoor old Peachey that hadnt done them
any harmthat hadnt done them any

He rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of
his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes

They was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said
he was more of a God than old Daniel that was a man Then they turned
him out on the snow and told him to go home and Peachey came home in
about a year begging along the roads quite safe for Daniel Dravot he
walked before and said Come along Peachey Its a big thing were
doing The mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried
to fall on Peacheys head but Dan he held up his hand and Peachey came
along bent double He never let go of Dans hand and he never let go
of Dans head They gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind
him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and Peachey
was starving never would Peachey sell the same You know Dravot Sir
You knew Right Worshipful Brother Dravot Look at him now

He fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black
horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to
my tablethe dried withered head of Daniel Dravot The morning sun
that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind
sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw
turquoises that Carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples

You beold now said Carnehan the Emperor in his abit as he
livedthe King of Kafiristan with his crown upon his head Poor old
Daniel that was a monarch once

I shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold I recognised the
head of the man of Marwar Junction Carnehan rose to go I attempted to
stop him He was not fit to walk abroad Let me take away the whisky
and give me a little money he gasped I was a King once Ill go to
the Deputy Commissioner and ask to set in the Poorhouse till I get my
health No thank you I cant wait till you get a carriage for me Ive
urgent private affairsin the southat Marwar

He shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the
Deputy Commissioners house That day at noon I had occasion to go down
the blindinghot Mall and I saw a crooked man crawling along the white
dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after
the fashion of streetsingers at Home There was not a soul in sight
and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses And he sang
through his nose turning his head from right to left

 The Son of Man goes forth to war
 A golden crown to gain
 His bloodred banner streams afar
 Who follows in His train

I waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and
drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the
Asylum He repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not
in the least recognise and I left him singing it to the missionary

Two days later I inquired after his welfare of the Superintendent of the
Asylum

He was admitted suffering from sunstroke He died early yesterday
morning said the Superintendent Is it true that he was half an hour
bareheaded in the sun at midday

Yes said I but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by
any chance when he died

Not to my knowledge said the Superintendent

And there the matter rests




TAJIMA By Miss Mitford


Once upon a time a certain ronin Tajima Shume by name an able and
wellread man being on his travels to see the world went up to Kiyoto
by the Tokaido The road of the Eastern Sea the famous highroad
leading from Kiyoto to Yedo The name is also used to indicate the
provinces through which it runs One day in the neighbourhood of
Nagoya in the province of Owari he fell in with a wandering priest
with whom he entered into conversation Finding that they were bound for
the same place they agreed to travel together beguiling their weary
way by pleasant talk on divers matters and so by degrees as they
became more intimate they began to speak without restraint about their
private affairs and the priest trusting thoroughly in the honour of
his companion told him the object of his journey

For some time past said he I have nourished a wish that has
engrossed all my thoughts for I am bent on setting up a molten image
in honour of Buddha with this object I have wandered through various
provinces collecting alms and who knows by what weary toil we have
succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silverenough I trust to
erect a handsome bronze figure

What says the proverb He who bears a jewel in his bosom bears poison
Hardly had the ronin heard these words of the priest than an evil heart
arose within him and he thought to himself Mans life from the womb
to the grave is made up of good and of ill luck Here am I nearly
forty years old a wanderer without a calling or even a hope of
advancement in the world To be sure it seems a shame yet if I could
steal the money this priest is boasting about I could live at ease for
the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might
compass his purpose But the priest far from guessing the drift of his
comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the
town of Kuana Here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in
ferryboats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers
are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers
embarked About halfway across the priest was taken with a sudden
necessity to go to the side of the boat and the ronin following him
tripped him up while no one was looking and flung him into the sea
When the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest
struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to
save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under
the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the
drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him

When he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and
said to his fellowpassengers This priest whom we have just lost was
my cousin he was going to Kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron
and as I happened to have business there as well we settled to travel
together Now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and I am
left alone

He spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed
his story and pitied and tried to comfort him Then the ronin said to
the boatmen

We ought by rights to report this matter to the authorities but as I
am pressed for time and the business might bring trouble on yourselves
as well perhaps we had better hush it up for the present I will at
once go on to Kiyoto and tell my cousins patron besides writing home
about it What think you gentlemen added he turning to the other
travellers

They of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their
onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had
proposed and so the matter was settled When at length they reached
the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the
ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and
putting it with his own pursued his journey to Kiyoto

On reaching the capital the ronin changed his name from Shume to
Tokubei and giving up his position as a samurai turned merchant and
traded with the dead mans money Fortune favouring his speculations
he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself
nothing and in course of time he married a wife who bore him a child

Thus the days and months wore on till one fine summers night some
three years after the priests death Tokubei stepped out on the veranda
of his house to enjoy the cool air and the beauty of the moonlight
Feeling dull and lonely he began musing over all kinds of things when
on a sudden the deed of murder and theft done so long ago vividly
recurred to his memory and he thought to himself Here am I grown
rich and fat on the money I wantonly stole Since then all has gone
well with me yet had I not been poor I had never turned assassin nor
thief Woe betide me what a pity it was and as he was revolving the
matter in his mind a feeling of remorse came over him in spite of all
he could do While his conscience thus smote him he suddenly to his
utter amazement beheld the faint outline of a man standing near a
firtree in the garden on looking more attentively he perceived that
the mans whole body was thin and worn and the eyes sunken and dim
and in that poor ghost that was before him he recognised the very priest
whom he had thrown into the sea at Kuana Chilled with horror he looked
again and saw that the priest was smiling in scorn He would have fled
into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and
clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare
and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary
man would have swooned with fear But Tokubei tradesman though he was
had once been a soldier and was not easily matched for daring so he
shook off the ghost and leaping into the room for his dirk laid about
him boldly enough but strike as he would the spirit fading into the
air eluded his blows and suddenly reappeared only to vanish again
and from that time forth Tokubei knew no rest and was haunted night and
day

At length undone by such ceaseless vexation Tokubei fell ill and
kept muttering Oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to
torture me Hearing his moans and the disturbance he made the
people in the house fancied he was mad and called in a physician who
prescribed for him But neither pill nor potion could cure Tokubei
whose strange frenzy soon became the talk of the whole neighbourhood

Now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering
priest who lodged in the next street When he heard the particulars
this priest gravely shook his head as though he knew all about it
and sent a friend to Tokubeis house to say that a wandering priest
dwelling hard by had heard of his illness and were it never so
grievous would undertake to heal it by means of his prayers and
Tokubeis wife driven half wild by her husbands sickness lost not
a moment in sending for the priest and taking him into the sick mans
room

But no sooner did Tokubei see the priest than he yelled out Help
help Here is the wandering priest come to torment me again Forgive
forgive and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all
over Then the priest turned all present out of the room put his mouth
to the affrighted mans ear and whispered

Three years ago at the Kuana ferry you flung me into the water and
well you remember it

But Tokubei was speechless and could only quake with fear

Happily continued the priest I had learned to swim and to dive as
a boy so I reached the shore and after wandering through many
provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to Buddha thus
fulfilling the wish of my heart On my journey homeward I took a
lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment
Thinking I could divine its cause I came to see you and am glad to
find I was not mistaken You have done a hateful deed but am I not a
priest and have I not forsaken the things of this world and would it
not ill become me to bear malice Repent therefore and abandon your
evil ways To see you do so I should esteem the height of happiness Be
of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that I am
really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you

Seeing he had no ghost to deal with and overwhelmed by the priests
kindness Tokubei burst into tears and answered Indeed indeed I
dont know what to say In a fit of madness I was tempted to kill and
rob you Fortune befriended me ever after but the richer I grew the
more keenly I felt how wicked I had been and the more I foresaw that my
victims vengeance would some day overtake me Haunted by this thought
I lost my nerve till one night I beheld your spirit and from that time
fell ill But how you managed to escape and are still alive is more
than I can understand

A guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling
of the wind or the chattering of a storks beak a murderers conscience
preys upon his mind till he sees what is not Poverty drives a man to
crimes which he repents of in his wealth How true is the doctrine of
Moshi Mencius that the heart of man pure by nature is corrupted by
circumstances

Thus he held forth and Tokubei who had long since repented of his
crime implored forgiveness and gave him a large sum of money saying
Half of this is the amount I stole from you three years since the
other half I entreat you to accept as interest or as a gift

The priest at first refused the money but Tokubei insisted on his
accepting it and did all he could to detain him but in vain for the
priest went on his way and bestowed the money on the poor and needy As
for Tokubei himself he soon shook off his disorder and thenceforward
lived at peace with all men revered both at home and abroad and ever
intent on good and charitable deeds




A CHINESE GIRL GRADUATE By R K Douglas


Who among the three hundred million sons of Han does not know the
saying

 Theres Paradise above t is true
 But here below weve Hang and Soo
 Hangchow and Soochow

And though no one will deny the beauty of those farfamed cities they
cannot compare in grandeur of situation and boldness of features with
many of the towns of the providence of the Four Streams Foremost
among the favoured spots of this part of the empire is Mienchu which
as its name implies is celebrated for the silky bamboos which grow
in its immediate neighbourhood These form however only one of the
features of its loveliness Situated at the foot of a range of mountains
which rise through all the gradations from rich and abundant verdure
to the region of eternal snow it lies embosomed in groves of beech
cypress and bamboo through the leafy screens of which rise the
upturned yellow roofs of the temples and official residences which dot
the landscape like golden islands in an emerald sea while beyond the
wall hurries between high and rugged banks the tributary of the Fu
River which bears to the mighty waters of the YangtszeKiang the goods
and passengers which seek an outlet to the eastern provinces

The streets within the walls of the city are scenes of life and bustle
while in the suburbs stand the residences of those who can afford to
live in peace and quiet undisturbed by the clamour of the Les and
Changs ie the people Le and Chang are the two commonest names in
China of the town There in a situation which the Son of Heaven might
envy stands the official residence of Colonel Wen Outwardly it has
all the appearance of a grandees palace and within the massive
boundarywalls which surround it the courtyards halls grounds
summerhouses and pavilions are not to be exceeded in grandeur and
beauty The office which had fallen to the lot of Colonel Wen was one
of the most sought after in the province and commonly only fell to
officers of distinction Though not without fame in the field Colonel
Wens main claim to honour lay in the high degrees he had taken in the
examinations His literary acquirements gained him friends among
the civil officers of the district and the position he occupied was
altogether one of exceptional dignity

Unfortunately his first wife had died leaving only a daughter to
keep her memory alive but at the time when our story opens his second
spouse more kind than his first had presented him with a muchdesired
son The mother of this boy was one of those bright pretty gay
creatures who commonly gain the affections of men much older than
themselves She sang in the most faultless falsetto she played the
guitar with taste and expression and she danced with grace and agility
What wonder then that when the colonel returned from his tours of
inspections and parades weary with travel and dust he found relief and
relaxation in the joyous company of Hyacinth And was she not also the
mother of his son Next to herself there can be no question that this
young gentleman held the chief place in the colonels affections while
poor Jasmine his daughter by his first venture was left very much to
her own resources No one troubled themselves about what she did and
she was allowed as she grew up to follow her own pursuits and to
give rein to her fancies without let or hindrance From her earliest
childhood one of her lonely amusements had been to dress as a boy and
so unchecked had the habit become that she gradually drifted into the
character which she had chosen to assume She even persuaded her father
to let her go to the neighbouring boys school Her mother had died
before the colonel had been posted to Mienchu and among the people of
that place who had always seen her in boys attire she was regarded as
an adopted son of her father Hyacinth was only too glad to get her out
of the way as much as possible and so encouraged the idea of allowing
her to learn to read and write in the company of their neighbours
urchins

Being bright and clever she soon gained an intellectual lead among the
boys and her uncommon beauty coupled with the magnetism belonging
to her sex secured for her a popularity which almost amounted to
adoration She was tall for her age as are most young daughters of Han
and her perfectly oval face almondshaped eyes willowleaf eyebrows
small wellshaped mouth brilliantly white teeth and ravenblack hair
completed a face and figure which would have been noticeable anywhere
By the boys she was worshipped and no undertaking was too difficult or
too troublesome if it was to give pleasure to Tsunking or the Young
Noble as she was called for to have answered to the name of Jasmine
would have been to proclaim her sex at once Even the grim old
master smiled at her through his horn spectacles as she entered the
schoolhouse of a morning and any graceful turn in her poetry or
scholarly diction in her prose was sure to win for her his unsparing
praise Many an evening he invited the young noble to his house to
read over chapters from Confucius and the poems of Le Taipoh and years
afterward when he died among his most cherished papers were found
odes signed by Tsunking in which there was a good deal about bending
willows light flickering bamboos horned moons wild geese the sound
of a flute on a rainy day and the pleasures of wine in strict accord
with the models set forth in the Aids to Poetrymaking which are
common in the land

If it had not been for the indifference with which she was treated in
her home the favour with which she was regarded abroad would have
been most prejudicial to Jasmine but any conceit which might have been
engendered in the schoolhouse was speedily counteracted when she got
within the portals of the colonels domain Coming into the presence of
her father and his wife with all the incense of kindness affection
and it must be confessed flattery with which she was surrounded by
her schoolfellows fresh about her was like stepping into a cold bath
Wholesome and invigorating the change may have been but it was very
unpleasant and Jasmine often longed to be alone to give vent to her
feelings in tears

One deep consolation she had however she was a devoted student and in
the society of her books she forgot the callousness of her parents and
living in imagination in the bygone annals of the empire she was able
to take part as it were in the great deeds which mark the past history
of the state and to enjoy the converse and society of the sages and
poets of antiquity When the time came that she had gained all the
knowledge which the old schoolmaster could impart to her she left the
school and formed a readingparty with two youths of her own age
These lads by name Wei and Tu had been her schoolfellows and were
delighted at obtaining her promise to join them in their studies So
industriously were these pursued that the three friends succeeded in
taking their BA degree at the next examination and encouraged by
this success determined to venture on a struggle for a still higher
distinction

Though at one in their affection for Jasmine Tu and Wei were unlike
in everything else which probably accounted for the friendship which
existed between them Wei was the more clever of the two He wrote
poetry with ease and fluency and his essays were marked by correctness
of style and aptness of quotation But there was a want of strength in
his character He was exceedingly vain and was always seeking to excite
admiration among his companions This unhappy failing made him very
susceptible of adverse criticism and at the same time extremely jealous
of any one who might happen to excel him in any way Tu on the other
hand though not so intellectually favoured had a rough kind of
originality which always secured for his exercises a respectful
attention and made him at all times an agreeable companion Having
no exaggerated ideas of his capabilities he never strove to appear
otherwise than he was and being quite independent of the opinions of
others he was always natural Thus he was one who was sought out by
his friends and was best esteemed by those whose esteem was best worth
having In outward appearance the youths were as different as their
characters were diverse Wei was decidedly goodlooking but of a kind
of beauty which suggested neither rest nor sincerity while in Tus
features though there was less grace the want was fully compensated
for by the strength and honest firmness of his countenance

For both these young men Jasmine had a liking but there was no question
as to which she preferred As she herself said Wei is pleasant enough
as a companion but if I had to look to one of them for an act of true
friendshipor as a lover she mentally addedI should turn at once
to Tu It was one of her amusements to compare the young men in her
mind and one day when so occupied Tu suddenly looked up from his book
and said to her

What a pity it is that the gods have made us both men If _I_ were a
woman the object of my heart would be to be your wife and if _you_
were a woman there is nothing I should like better than to be your
husband

Jasmine blushed up to the roots of her hair at having her own thoughts
thus capped as it were but before she could answer Wei broke in with

What nonsense you talk And why I should like to know should you be
the only one the young noble might choose supposing he belonged to
the other sex

You are both talking nonsense said Jasmine who had had time to
recover her composure and remind me of my two old childless aunts
she added laughing who are always quarrelling about the names they
would have given their children if the goddess Kwanyin had granted them
any half a century ago As a matter of act we are three friends reading
for our MA degrees neither more nor less And I will trouble you
my elder brother she added turning to Tu to explain to me what the
poet means by the expression tuneful Tung in the line

 The greedy flames devour the tuneful Tung

A learned disquisition by Tu on the celebrated musician who recognised
the sonorous qualities of a piece of Tung timber burning in the kitchen
fire effectually diverted the conversation from the inconvenient
direction it had taken and shortly afterward Jasmine took her leave

Haunted by the thought of what had passed she wandered on to the
veranda of her archery pavilion and while gazing half unconsciously
heavenward her eyes were attracted by a hawk which flew past and
alighted on a tree beyond the boundarywall and in front of the study
she had lately left In a restless and thoughtless mood she took up her
bow and arrow and with unerring aim compassed the death of her victim
No sooner however had the hawk fallen carrying the arrow with it
than she remembered that her name was inscribed on the shaft and
fearing lest it should be found by either Wei or Tu she hurried round
in the hope of recovering it But she was too late On approaching
the study she found Tu in the garden in front examining the bird and
arrow

Look he said as he saw her coming what a good shot some one has
made and whoever it is he has a due appreciation of his own skill
Listen to these lines which are scraped on the arrow

 Do not lightly draw your bow
 But if you must bring down your foe

Jasmine was glad enough to find that he had not discovered her name
and eagerly exchanged banter with him on the conceit of the owner of the
arrow But before she could recover it Wei who had heard the talking
and laughter joined them and took the arrow out of Tus hand to
examine it Just at that moment a messenger came to summon Tu to his
fathers presence and he had no sooner gone than Wei exclaimed

But see here is the name of the mysterious owner of the arrow and as
I live it is a girls nameJasmine Who among the goddesses of heaven
can Jasmine be

Oh I will take the arrow then said Jasmine It must belong to my
sister That is her name

I did not know that you had a sister said Wei

Oh yes I have answered Jasmine quite forgetful of the celebrated
dictum of Confucius Be truthful She is just one year younger than I
am she added thinking it well to be circumstantial

Why have you never mentioned her asked Wei with animation What is
she like Is she anything like you

She is the very image of me

What In height and features and ways

The very image so that people have often said that if we changed
clothes each might pass for the other

What a goodlooking girl she must be said Wei laughing But
seriously I have not as you know yet set up a household and if your
sister has not received bridal presents I would beg to be allowed to
invite her to enter my lowly habitation What does my elder brother say
to my proposal

I dont know what my sister would feel about it said Jasmine I
would never answer for a girl if I lived to be as old as the God of
Longevity

Will you find out for me

Certainly I will But remember not a word must be mentioned on the
subject to my father or in fact to anybody until I give you leave

So long as my elder brother will undertake for me I will promise
anything said the delighted Wei I already feel as though I were
ninetenths of the way to the abode of the phenix Take this box of
precious ointment to your sister as an earnest of my intentions and I
will keep the arrow as a token from her until she demands its return I
feel inclined to express myself in verse May I

By all means said Jasmine laughing

Thus encouraged Wei improvised as follows

 T was sung of old that Lofu had no mate
 Though Che was willing for no word was said
 At last an arrow like a herald came
 And now an honoured brother lends his aid

Excellent said Jasmine laughing With such a poetic gift as you
possess you certainly deserve a better fate than befell Lofu

From this day the idea of marrying Jasmines sister possessed the
soul of Wei But not a word did he say to Tu on the matter for he was
conscious that as Tu was the first to pick up the arrow through which
he had become acquainted with the existence of Jasmines sister his
friend might possibly lay a claim to her hand To Jasmine also the
subject was a most absorbing one She felt that she was becoming most
unpleasantly involved in a risky matter and that if the time should
ever come when she should have to make an explanation she might in
honour be compelled to marry Weia prospect which filled her with
dismay The turn events had taken had made her analyse her feelings more
than she had ever done before and the process made her doubly conscious
of the depth of her affection for Tu A horse she said to herself
cannot carry two saddles and a woman cannot marry more than one man
Wise as this saw was it did not help her out of her difficulty and
she turned to the chapter of accidents and determined to trust to time
that old disposer of events to settle the matter But Wei was inclined
to be impatient and Jasmine was obliged to resort to more of those
departures from truth which circumstances had forced upon this generally
very upright young lady

I have consulted my father on the subject she said to the expectant
Wei and he insists on your waiting until the autumn examination is
over He has every confidence that you will then take your MA degree
and your marriage will he hopes put the copingstone on your happiness
and honour

That is all very well said Wei but autumn is a long time hence and
how do I know that your sister may not change her mind

Has not your younger brother undertaken to look after your interests
and cannot you trust him to do his best on your behalf

I can trust my elder brother with anything in the world It is your
sister that I am afraid of said Wei But since you will undertake for
her

No no said Jasmine laughing I did not say that I would undertake
for her A man who answers for a woman deserves to have fool written
on his forehead

Well at all events I will be content to leave the matter in your
hands said Wei

At last the time of the autumn examination drew near and Tu and Wei
made preparations for their departure to the provincial capital They
were both bitterly disappointed when Jasmine announced that she was not
going up that time This determination was the result of a conference
with her father She had pointed out to the colonel that if she passed
and took her MA degree she might be called upon to take office at any
time and that then she would be compelled to confess her sex and as
she was by no means disposed to give up the freedom which her doublet
and hose conferred upon her it was agreed between them that she should
plead illness and not go up Her two friends therefore went alone and
brilliant success attended their venture They both passed with honours
and returned to Mienchu to receive the congratulations of their friends
Jasmines delight was very genuine more especially as regarded Tu and
the first evening was spent by the three students in joyous converse and
in confident anticipation of the future As Jasmine took leave of the
two new MAs Wei followed her to the outer door and whispered at
parting

I am coming tomorrow to make my formal proposal to your sister

Jasmine had no time to answer but went home full of anxious and
disturbed thoughts which were destined to take a more tragic turn than
she had ever anticipated even in her most gloomy moments The same cruel
fate had also decreed that Weis proposal was to be suspended like
Buddha between heaven and earth The blow fell upon him when he was
attiring himself in the garments of his new degree in preparation for
his visit He was in the act of tying his sash and appending it to
his purse and trinkets when Jasmine burst into the young mens study
looking deadly pale and bearing traces of acute mental distress on her
usually bright and joyous countenance

What is the matter cried Tu with almost as much agitation as was
shown by Jasmine Tell me what has happened

Oh my father my poor father sobbed Jasmine

What is the matter with your father He is not dead is he cried the
young men in one breath

No it is not so bad as that said Jasmine but a great and bitter
misfortune has come upon us As you know some time ago my father had
a quarrel with the military intendant and that horrid man has out of
spite brought charges against him for which he was carried off this
morning to prison

The statement of her misery and the shame involved in it completely
unnerved poor Jasmine who true to her inner sex burst into tears
and rocked herself to and fro in her grief Tu and Wei on their knees
before her tried to pour in words of consolation With a lack of reason
which might be excused under the circumstances they vowed that her
father was innocent before they knew the nature of the charges against
him and they pledged themselves to rest neither day nor night until
they had rescued him from his difficulty When under the influence of
their genuine sympathy Jasmine recovered some composure Tu begged her
to tell him of what her father was accused

The villain said Jasmine through her tears has dared to say
that my father has made use of government taxes has taken bribes
for recommending men for promotion has appropriated the soldiers
rationmoney and has been in league with highwaymen

Is it possible said Tu who was rather staggered by this long
catalogue of crimes I should not have believed that any one could have
ventured to have charged your honoured father with such things least of
all the intendant who is notoriously possessed of an itching palm But
I tell you what we can do at once Wei and I being MAs have a right
to call on the prefect and it will be a real pleasure to us to exercise
our new privilege for the first time in your service We will urge him
to inquire into the matter and I cannot doubt that he will at once
quash the proceedings

Unhappily Tus hopes were not realised The prefect was very civil
but pointed out that since a higher court had ordered the arrest of
the colonel he was powerless to interfere in the matter Many were
the consultations held by the three friends and much personal relief
Jasmine got from the support and sympathy of the young men One hope
yet remained to her Tu and Wei were about to go to Peking for their
doctors degrees and if they passed they might be able to bring such
influence to bear as would secure the release of her father

Let not the young noble distress himself overmuch said Wei to her
with some importance This affair will be engraven on our hearts and
minds and if we take our degrees we will use our utmost exertions to
wipe away the injustice which has been done your father

Unhappily said the more practical Tu it is too plain that the
examining magistrates are all in league to ruin him But let our elder
brother remain quietly at home doing all he can to collect evidence
in the colonels favour while we will do our best at the capital If
things turn out well with us there our elder brother had better follow
at once to assist us with his advice

Before the friends parted Wei whose own affairs were always his first
consideration took an opportunity of whispering to Jasmine Dont
forget your honoured sisters promise I beseech you Whether we succeed
or not I shall ask for her in marriage on my return

Under present circumstances we must no longer consider the
engagement said Jasmine shocked at his introducing the subject at
such a moment and the best thing that you can do is to forget all
about it

The moment for the departure of the young men had come and they had no
time to say more With bitter tears the two youths took leave of the
weeping Jasmine who as their carts disappeared in the distance felt
for the first time what it was to be alone in misery She saw little of
her stepmother in those days That poor lady made herself so ill with
unrestrained grief that she was quite incapable of rendering either help
or advice Fortunately the officials showed no disposition to proceed
with the indictment and by the judicious use of the money at her
command Jasmine induced the prison authorities to make her fathers
confinement as little irksome as possible She was allowed to see him at
almost any time and on one occasion when he was enjoying her presence
as in his prosperous days he had never expected to do he remarked

Since the officials are not proceeding with the business I think my
best plan will be to send a petition to Peking asking the Board of War
to acquit me But my difficulty is that I have no one whom I can send to
look after the business

Let _me_ go said Jasmine When Tu and Wei were leaving they begged
me to follow them to consult as to the best means of helping you and
with them to depend on I have nothing to fear

I quite believe that you are as capable of managing the matter as
anybody said her father admiringly but Peking is a long way off
and I cannot bear to think of the things which might happen to you on
the road

From all time answered Jasmine it has been considered the duty of
a daughter to risk anything in the service of her father and though the
way is long I shall have weapons to defend myself with against injury
and a clear conscience with which to answer any interrogatories which
may be put to me Besides I will take our messenger The Dragon and
his wife with me I will make her dress as a manwhat fun it will be
to see Mrs Dragons portly form in trousers and gabardine When that
transformation is made we shall be a party of three men So you see
she and I will have a man to protect us and I shall have a woman to
wait upon me and if such a gallant company cannot travel from this to
Peking in safety Ill forswear boots and trousers and will retire into
the harem for ever

Well said her father laughing if you can arrange in that way go
by all means and the sooner you start the sooner I hope you will be
back

Delighted at having gained the approval of her father to her scheme
Jasmine quickly made the arrangements for her journey On the morning
of the day on which she was to start the results of the doctors
examination at Peking reached Mienchu and to Jasmines infinite
delight she found the names of Tu and Wei among the successful
candidates Armed with this good news she hurried to the prison All
difficulties seemed to disappear like mist before the sun as she thought
of the powerful advocates she now had at Peking

Tu and Wei have passed she said as she rushed into her fathers
presence and now the end of our troubles is approaching



With impatient hope Jasmine took leave of her father and started on
her eventful journey As evening drew on she entered the suburbs of
Chengtu the provincial capital and sent The Dragon on to find
a suitable inn for the couple of nights which she knew she would be
compelled to spend in the city The Dragon was successful in his
search and conducted Jasmine and his wife to a comfortable hostelry in
one of the busiest parts of the town Having refreshed herself with an
excellent dinner Jasmine was glad to rest from the fatigues and heat
of the day in the cool courtyard into which her room opened Fortune and
builders had so arranged that a neighbouring house towering above the
inn overlooked this restful spot and one of the higher windows faced
exactly the position which Jasmine had taken up Such a fact would not
in ordinary circumstances have troubled her in the least but she
had not been sitting long before she began to feel an extraordinary
attraction toward the window She did her best to look the other way
but she was often unconsciously impelled to glance up at the lattice
Once she fancied she saw the curtain move Determined to verify
her impression she suddenly raised her eyes after a prolonged
contemplation of the pavement and caught a momentary sight of a girls
face which as instantly disappeared but not before Jasmine had been
able to recognise that it was one of exceptional beauty

Now if I were a young man said she to herself I ought to feel my
heart beat at the sight of such loveliness and it would be my bounden
duty to swear that I would win the owner of it in the teeth of dragons
But as my manhood goes no deeper than my outer garments I can afford to
sit here with a quiet pulse and a whole skin

The next day Jasmine was busily engaged in interviewing some officials
in the interest of her father and only reached the shelter of her inn
toward evening As she passed through the courtyard she instinctively
looked up at the window and again caught a glimpse of the vision
of beauty which she had seen the evening before If she only knew
thought Jasmine that I was such a one as herself she would be less
anxious to see me and more likely to avoid me

While amusing herself at the thought of the fair watcher the inn
door opened and a waitingwoman entered carrying a small box As she
approached Jasmine she bowed low and with bated breath thus addressed
her

May every happiness be yours sir My young lady Miss King whose
humble dwelling is the adjoining house seeing that you are living
in solitude has sent me with this fruit and tea as a complimentary
offering

So saying she presented to Jasmine the box which contained pears and a
packet of scented tea

To what am I indebted for this honour replied Jasmine I can
claim no relationship with your lady nor have I the honour of her
acquaintance

My young lady says answered the waitingwoman that among the
myriads who come to this inn and the thousands who go from it she has
seen no one to equal your Excellency in form and feature At sight of
you she was confident that you came from a lofty and noble family and
having learned from your attendants that you are the son of a colonel
she ventured to send you these trifles to supplement the needy fare of
this rude inn

Tell me something about your young lady said Jasmine in a moment of
idle curiosity

My young lady said the woman is the daughter of Mr King who was
a vicepresident of a lower court Her father and mother having both
visited the Yellow Springs Hades she is now living with an aunt
who has been blessed by the God of Wealth and whose main object in life
is to find a husband whom her niece may be willing to marry The
young gentleman my young ladys cousin is one of the richest men in
Chengtu All the larger inns belong to him and his profits are as
boundless as the four seas He is as anxious as his mother to find a
suitable match for the young lady and has promised that so soon as she
can make a choice he will arrange the wedding

I should have thought said Jasmine that being the owner of so much
wealth and beauty the young lady would have been besieged by suitors
from all parts of the empire

So she is said the woman and from her window yonder she espies
them for they all put up at this inn Hitherto she has made fun of them
all and describes their appearance and habits in the most amusing way
See this one says she with his bachelor cap on and his new official
clothes and awkward gait looking for all the world like a barndoor
fowl dressed up as a stork or that one with his round shoulders
monkeyface and crooked legs and so she tells them off

What does she say of me I wonder said Jasmine amused

Of your Excellency she says that her comparisons fail her and that she
can only hope that the Fates who guided your jewelled chariot hitherward
will not tantalise her by an empty vision but will bind your ankles to
hers with the red matrimonial cords

How can I hope for such happiness said Jasmine smiling But please
to tell your young lady that being only a guest at this inn I have
nothing worthy of her acceptance to offer in return for her bounteous
gifts and that I can only assure her of my boundless gratitude

With many bows and with reiterated wishes for Jasmines happiness and
endless longevity the woman took her leave

Truly this young lady has formed a most perverted attachment said
Jasmine to herself She reminds me of the man in the fairy tale who
fell in love with a shadow and so far as I can see she is not likely
to get any more satisfaction out of it than he did So saying she took
up a pencil and scribbled the following lines on a scrap of paper

 With thoughts as ardent as a quenchless thirst
 She sends me fragrant and most luscious fruit
 Without a blush she seeks a phenix guest a bachelor
 Who dwells alone like caseenveloped lute

After this mental effort Jasmine went to bed Nor had her interview with
the waitingwoman made a sufficient impression on her mind to interfere
in any way with her sleep She was surprised however on coming into
her sittingroom in the morning to meet the same messenger who laden
with a dish of hot eggs and a brew of tea begged Jasmine to deign to
look down upon her offerings

Many thanks said Jasmine for your kind attention

You are putting the saddle on the wrong horse replied the woman In
bringing you these I am but obeying the orders of Miss King who herself
made the tea of leaves from Puerh in Yunnan and who with her own fair
hands shelled the eggs

Your young lady answered Jasmine is as bountiful as she is kind
What return can I make her for her kindness to a stranger Stay she
said as the thought crossed her mind that the verses she had written
the night before might prove a wholesome tonic for this effusive young
lady I have a few verses which I will venture to ask her to accept
So saying she took a piece of peachblossom paper on which she
carefully copied the quatrain and handed it to the woman May I trouble
you said she to take this to your mistress

If said Jasmine to herself as the woman took her departure Miss
King is able to penetrate the meaning of my verses she wont like them
Without saying so in so many words I have told her with sufficient
plainness that I will have nothing to say to her But stupidity is a
shield sent by Providence to protect the greater part of mankind from
many evils so perhaps she will escape

It certainly in this case served to shield Miss King from Jasmines
shafts She was delighted at receiving the verses and at once sat down
to compose a quatrain to match Jasmines in reply With infinite labour
she elaborated the following

 Sung Yuh on th eastern wall sat deep in thought
 And longed with Pe to pluck the fragrant fruit
 If all the wellknown tunes be newly set
 What use to take again the halfburnt lute

Having copied these on a piece of silkwoven paper she sent them to
Jasmine by her faithful attendant On looking over the paper Jasmine
said smiling What a clever young lady your mistress must be These
lines though somewhat inconsequential are incomparable

But though Jasmine was partly inclined to treat the matter as a joke
she saw that there was a serious side to the affair more especially as
the colours under which she was sailing were so undeniably false She
knew well that for Sung Yuh should be read Miss King and for Pe
her own name and she determined therefore to put an end to the
philandering of Miss King which in her present state of mind was
doubly annoying to her

I am deeply indebted to your young lady she said and then being
determined to make a plunge into the morass of untruthfulness for a
good end as she believed added and if I had love at my disposal I
should possibly venture to make advances toward the feathery peach a
nuptial emblem but let me confess to you that I have already taken
to myself a wife Had I the felicity of meeting Miss King before I
committed myself in another direction I might perhaps have been a
happier man But after all if this were so my position is no worse
than that of most other married men for I never met one who was not
occasionally inclined to cry like the boys at toss cash Hark back
and try again

This will be sad news for my lady for she has set her heart upon you
ever since you first came to the inn and when young misses take that
sort of fancy and lose the objects of their love they are as bad as
children when forbidden their sugarplums But whats the use of talking
to you about a young ladys feelings said the woman with a vexed toss
of her head I never knew a man who understood a woman yet

I am extremely sorry for Miss King said Jasmine trying to suppress a
smile As you wisely remark a young lady is a sealed book to me but
I have always been told that their fancies are as variable as the shadow
of the bamboo and probably therefore though Miss Kings sky may
be overcast just now the gloom will only make her enjoy tomorrows
sunshine all the more

The woman who was evidently in a hurry to convey the news to her
mistress returned no answer to this last sally but with curtailed
obeisance took her departure

Her nonappearance the next morning confirmed Jasmine in the belief
that her bold departure from truth on the previous evening had had
its curative effect The relief was great for she had felt that
these complications were becoming too frequent to be pleasant and
reprehensible though it may appear her relief was mingled with no sort
of compassion for Miss King Hers was not a nature to sympathise with
such sudden and fierce attachments Her affection for Tu had been the
growth of many months and she had no feeling in common with a young
lady who could take a violent liking for a young man simply from seeing
him taking his postprandial ease It was therefore with complete
satisfaction that she left the inn in the course of the morning to pay
her farewell visits to the governor and the judge of the province who
had taken an unusual interest in Colonel Wens case since Jasmine had
become his personal advocate Both officials had promised to do all they
could for the prisoner and had loaded Jasmine with tokens of good will
in the shape of strange and rare fruits and culinary delicacies On this
particular day the governor had invited her to the midday meal and it
was late in the afternoon before she found her way back to the inn

The following morning she rose early intending to start before noon
and was stepping into the courtyard to give directions to The Dragon
when to her surprise she was accosted by Miss Kings servant who
with a waggish smile and a cunning shake of the head said

How can one so young as your Excellency be such a proficient in the art
of inventing flowers of the imagination

What do you mean said Jasmine

Why last night you told me you were married and my poor young lady
when she heard it was wrung with grief But recovering somewhat she
sent me to ask your servants whether what you had said was true or not
for she knows what shes about as well as most people and they both
with one voice assured me that far from being married you had not even
exchanged nuptial presents with anybody You may imagine Miss Kings
delight when I took her this news She at once asked her cousin to call
upon you to make a formal offer of marriage and she has now sent me to
tell you that he will be here anon

Every one knows what it is to pass suddenly from a state of pleasurable
high spirits into deep despondency to exchange in an instant bright
mental sunshine for cloud and gloom All therefore must sympathise
with poor Jasmine who believing the road before her to be smooth and
clear on a sudden became thus aware of a most troublesome and difficult
obstruction She had scarcely finished calling down anathemas on the
heads of The Dragon and his wife and cursing her own folly for
bringing them with her than the inn doors were thrown open and a
servant appeared carrying a long red visitingcard inscribed with the
name of the wealthy innproprietor On the heels of this forerunner
followed young Mr King who with effusive bows said I have ventured
to pay my respects to your Excellency

Poor Jasmine was so upset by the whole affair that she lacked some of
the courtesy that was habitual to her and in her confusion very nearly
seated her guest on her right hand Fortunately this outrageous breach
of etiquette was avoided and the pair eventually arranged themselves in
the canonical order

This old son of Han began Mr King would not have dared to intrude
himself upon your Excellency if it were not that he has a matter of
great delicacy to discuss with you He has a cousin the daughter of
VicePresident King for whom for years he has been trying to find
a suitable match The position is peculiar for the lady declares
positively that she will not marry any one she has not seen and approved
of Until now she has not been able to find any one whom she would care
to marry But the presence of your Excellency has thrown a light across
her path which has shown her the way to the plumgroves of matrimonial
felicity

Here King paused expecting some reply but Jasmine was too absorbed in
thought to speak so Mr King went on

This old son of Han hearing that your Excellency is still unmarried
has taken it upon himself to make a proposal of marriage to you and to
offer his cousin as your basket and broom wife His interview with
you has he may say shown him the wisdom of his cousins choice and he
cannot imagine a pair better suited for one another or more likely to
be happy than your Excellency and his cousin

I dare not be anything but straightforward with your worship said
Jasmine and I am grateful for the extraordinary affection your cousin
has been pleased to bestow upon me but I cannot forget that she belongs
to a family which is entitled to pass through the gate of the palace a
family of distinction and I fear that my rank is not sufficient for
her Besides my father is at present under a cloud and I am now on
my way to Peking to try to release him from his difficulties It is no
time therefore for me to be binding myself with promises

As to your Excellencys first objection replied King you are
already the wearer of a hat with a silken tassel and a man need not be
a prophet to foretell that in time to come any office either civil or
military will be within your reach No doubt also your business in
Peking will be quickly brought to a satisfactory conclusion and there
can be no objection therefore to our settling the preliminaries now
and then on your return from the capital we can celebrate the wedding
This will give rest and composure to my cousins mind which is now like
a disturbed sea and will not interfere I venture to think with the
affair which calls you to Peking

As King proceeded Jasmine felt that her difficulties were on the
increase It was impossible that she should explain her position in
full and she had no sufficient reason at hand to give for rejecting the
proposal made her though as the same time her annoyance was not small
at having such a matter forced upon her at a moment when her mind was
filled with anxieties Then she thought to herself there is ahead
of me that explanation which must inevitably come with Wei so that
altogether if it were not for the deeply rooted conviction which I have
that Tu will be mine at last when he knows what I really am life would
not be worth having As for this innproprietor if he has so little
delicacy as to push his cousin upon me at this crisis I need not have
any compunction regarding him so perhaps my easiest way of getting out
of the present hobble will be to accept his proposal and to present the
box of precious ointment handed me by Wei for my sister to this ogling
lovesick girl So turning to King she said

Since you sir and your cousin have honoured me with your regard I
dare not altogether decline your proposal and I would therefore beg
you sir to hand this she added producing the box of ointment to
your honourable cousin as a token of the bond between us and to convey
to her my promise that if I dont marry her I will never marry another
lady

Mr King with the greatest delight received the box and handing it
to the waitingwoman who stood expectant by bade her carry it to her
mistress with the news of the engagement Jasmine now hoped that her
immediate troubles were over but King insisted on celebrating the
event by a feast and it was not until late in the afternoon that she
succeeded in making a start Once on the road her anxiety to reach
Peking was such that she travelled night and day feeding on wind and
lodging in water Nor did she rest until she reached a hotel within the
Hata Gate of the capital



Jasmines solitary journey had given her abundant time for reflection
and for the first time she had set herself seriously to consider
her position She recognised that she had hitherto followed only the
impulses of the moment of which the main one had been the desire
to escape complications by the wholesale sacrifice of truth and she
acknowledged to herself that if justice were evenly dealt out there
must be a Nemesis in store for her which would bring distress
and possibly disaster upon her In her calmer moments she felt an
instinctive foreboding that she was approaching a crisis in her fate
and it was with mixed feelings therefore that on the morning after her
arrival she prepared to visit Tu and Wei who were as yet ignorant of
her presence

She dressed herself with more than usual care for the occasion choosing
to attire herself in a blue silk robe and a mauve satin jacket which Tu
had once admired topped by a brandnew cap Altogether her appearance
as she passed through the streets justified the remark made by a
passerby A pretty youngster and more like a maiden of eighteen than a
man

The hostelry at which Tu and Wei had taken up their abode was an inn
befitting the dignity of such distinguished scholars On inquiring at
the door Jasmine was ushered by a servant through a courtyard to an
inner enclosure where under the grateful shade of a widespreading
cottontree Tu was reclining at his ease Jasmines delight at meeting
her friend was only equalled by the pleasure with which Tu greeted her
In his strong and gracious presence she became conscious that she was
released from the absorbing care which had haunted her and her soul
leaped out in new freedom as she asked and answered questions of her
friend Each had much to say and it was not for some time when an
occasional reference brought his name forward that Jasmine noticed the
absence of Wei When she did she asked after him

He left this some days ago said Tu having some special business
which called for his presence at home He did not tell me what it was
but doubtless it was something of importance Jasmine said nothing but
felt pretty certain in her mind as to the object of his hasty return

Tu attributing her silence to a reflection on Wei for having left the
capital before her fathers affair was settled hastened to add

He was very helpful in the matter of your honoured fathers difficulty
and only left when he thought he could not do any more

How do matters stand now asked Jasmine eagerly

We have posted a memorial at the palace gate said Tu and have
arranged that it shall reach the right quarter Fortunately also I
have an acquaintance in the Board of War who has undertaken to do all he
can in that direction and promises an answer in a few days

I have brought with me said Jasmine a petition prepared by my
father What do you think about presenting it

At present I believe that it would only do harm A superabundance of
memorials is as bad as none at all Beyond a certain point they only
irritate officials

Very well said Jasmine I am quite content to leave the conduct of
affairs in your hands

Well then said Tu that being understood I propose that you should
move your things over to this inn There is Weis room at your disposal
and your constant presence here will be balm to my lonely spirit At
the Hata Gate you are almost as remote as if you were in our study at
Mienchu

Jasmine was at first startled by this proposal Though she had been
constantly in the company of Tu she had never lived under the same roof
with him and she at once recognised that there might be difficulties in
the way of her keeping her secret if she were to be constantly under the
eyes of her friend But she had been so long accustomed to yield to the
present circumstances and was so confident that Fortune which with
some slight irregularities had always stood her friend would not
desert her on the present occasion that she gave way

By all means she said I will go back to my inn and bring my things
at once This writingcase I will leave here I brought it because it
contains my fathers petition

So saying she took her leave and Tu retired to his easychair under
the cottontree But the demon of curiosity was abroad and alighting on
the arm of Tus chair whispered in his ear that it might be well if he
ran his eye over Colonel Wens petition to see if there was any argument
in it which he had omitted in his statement to the Board of War At
first Tu whose nature was the reverse of inquisitive declined to
listen to these promptings but so persistent did they become that he
at last put down his bookThe Spring and Autumn Annalsand
seating himself at the sittingroom table opened the writingcase
so innocently left by Jasmine On the top were a number of red
visitingcards bearing the inscription in black of Wen Tsunking and
beneath these was the petition Carefully Tu read it through and passed
mental eulogies on it as he proceeded The colonel had put his case
skilfully but Tu had no difficulty in recognising Jasmines hand
both in the composition of the document and in the penmanship If my
attempt he thought does not succeed we will try what this will do
He was on the point of returning it to its restingplace when he
saw another document in Jasmines handwriting lying by it This was
evidently a formal document probably connected as he thought with the
colonels case and he therefore unfolded it and read as follows

The faithful maiden Miss Wen of Mienchu Hien with burning incense
reverently prays the God of War to release her father from his
present difficulties and speedily to restore peace to her own soul by
nullifying in accordance with her desire the engagement of the bamboo
arrow and the contract of the box of precious ointment A respectful
petition

As Tu read on surprise and astonishment took possession of his
countenance A second time he read it through and then throwing
himself back in his chair broke out into a fit of laughter

So he said to himself I have allowed myself to be deceived by a
young girl all these years And yet not altogether deceived he added
trying to find an excuse for himself for I have often fancied that
there was the savour of a woman about the young noble I hope she is
not one of those heavenborn genii who appear on earth to plague men
and who just when they have aroused the affections they wished to
excite ascend through the air and leave their lovers mourning

Just at this moment the door opened and Jasmine entered looking more
lovely than ever with the flush begotten by exercise on her beautifully
moulded cheeks At sight of her Tu again burst out laughing to
Jasmines not unnatural surprise who thinking that there must be
something wrong with her dress looked herself up and down to the
increasing amusement of Tu

So said he at last you deceitful little hussy you have been
deceiving me all these years by passing yourself off as a man when in
reality you are a girl

Overcome with confusion Jasmine hung her head and murmured

Who has betrayed me

You have betrayed yourself said Tu holding up the incriminating
document and here we have the story of the arrow with which you shot
the hawk but what the box of precious ointment means I dont know

Confronted with this overwhelming evidence poor Jasmine remained
speechless and dared not even lift her eyes to glance at Tu That young
man seeing her distress and being in no wise possessed by the scorn
which he had put into his tone crossed over to her and gently led her
to a seat by him

Do you remember he said in so altered a voice that Jasmines heart
ceased to throb as if it wished to force an opening through the finely
formed bosom which enclosed it on one occasion in our study at home I
wished that you were a woman that you might become my wife Little did
I think that my wish might be gratified Now it is and I beseech you to
let us join our lives in one and seek the happiness of the gods in each
others perpetual presence

But as if suddenly recollecting herself Jasmine withdrew her hand from
his and standing up before him with quivering lip and eyes full of
tears said

No It can never be

Why not said Tu in alarmed surprise

Because I am bound to Wei

What Does Wei know your secret

No But do you remember when I shot that arrow in front of your study

Perfectly said Tu But what has that to do with it

Why Wei discovered my name on the shaft and I to keep my secret
told him that it was my sisters name He then wanted to marry my
sister and I undertook fool that I was to arrange it for him Now I
shall be obliged to confess the truth and he will have a right to claim
me instead of my supposed sister

But said Tu I have a prior right to that of Wei for it was I who
found the arrow And in this matter I shall be ready to outface him at
all hazards But he added Wei I am sure is not the man to take an
unfair advantage of you

Do you really think so asked Jasmine

Certainly I do said Tu

ThenthenI shall bevery glad said poor Jasmine hesitatingly
overcome with bashfulness but full of joy

At which gracious consent Tu recovered the hand which had been withdrawn
from his and Jasmine sank again into the chair at his side

But Tu dear she said after a pause there is something else that
I must tell you before I can feel that my confessions are over

What You have not engaged yourself to any one else have you said
Tu laughing

Yes I have she replied with a smile and she then gave her lover
a full and particular account of how Mr King had proposed to her on
behalf of his cousin and how she had accepted her

How could you frame your lips to utter such untruths said Tu half
laughing and half in earnest

O Tu falsehood is so easy and truth so difficult sometimes But I feel
that I have been very very wicked said poor Jasmine covering her
face with her hands

Well you certainly have got yourself into a pretty hobble So far as
I can make out you are at the present moment engaged to one young lady
and two young men

The situation thus expressed was so comical that Jasmine could
not refrain from laughing through her tears but after a somewhat
lengthened consultation with her lover her face recovered its wonted
serenity and round it hovered a halo of happiness which added light and
beauty to every feature There is something particularly entrancing in
receiving the first confidences of a pure and loving soul So Tu thought
on this occasion and while Jasmine was pouring the most secret workings
of her inmost being into his ear those lines of the poet of the Sung
dynasty came irresistibly into his mind

 T is sweet to see the flowers woo the sun
 To watch the quaint wiles of the cooing dove
 But sweeter far to hear the dulcet tones
 Of her one loves confessing her great love

But there is an end to everything even to the Confucian Analects
and so there was also to this lovers colloquy For just as Jasmine was
explaining for the twentieth time the origin and basis of her love for
Tu a waiter entered to announce the arrival of her luggage

I dont know quite said Tu where we are to put your two men But
bythebye he added as the thought struck him did you really travel
all the way in the company of these two men only

O Tu said Jasmine laughing I have something else to confess to
you

What another lover said Tu affecting horror and surprise

No not another lover but another woman The short stout one is a
woman and came as my maid She is the wife of The Dragon

Well now have you told me all For I am getting so confused about the
people you have transformed from women to men that I shall have doubts
about my own sex next

Yes Tu dear now you know all said Jasmine laughing But not all
the good news which was in store for him for scarcely had Jasmine done
speaking when a letter arrived from his friend in the Board of War who
wrote to say that he had succeeded in getting the military intendant of
Mienchu transferred to a post in the province of Kwangsi and that
the departure of this noxious official would mean the release of the
colonel as he alone was the colonels accuser This news added one more
chord of joy which had been making harmony in Jasmines heart for some
hours and readily she agreed with Tu that they should set off homeward
on the following morning

With no such adventure as that which had attended Jasmines journey to
the capital they reached Mienchu and to their delight were received
by the colonel in his own yamun After congratulating him on his
release which Jasmine took care he should understand was due
entirely to Tus exertions she gave him a full account of her various
experiences on the road and at the capital

It is like a story out of a book of marvels said her father and
even now you have not exhausted all the necessary explanations For
since my release your friend Wei has been here to ask for my daughter
in marriage From some questions I put to him he is evidently unaware
that you are my only daughter and I therefore put him off and told him
to wait until you returned He is in a very impatient state and no
doubt will be over shortly

Nor was the colonel wrong for almost immediately Wei was announced
who after expressing the genuine pleasure he felt at seeing Jasmine
again began at once on the subject which filled his mind

I am so glad he said to have this opportunity of asking you to
explain matters At present I am completely nonplussed On my return
from Peking I inquired of one of your fathers servants about his
daughter He has not got one quoth the man I went to another and he
said You mean the young noble I suppose No I dont I said I
mean his sister Well that is the only daughter I know of said he
Then I went to your father and all I could get out of him was Wait
until the young noble comes home Please tell me what all this
means

Your great desire is to marry a beautiful and accomplished girl is it
not said Jasmine

That certainly is my wish said Wei

Well then said Jasmine I can assure you that your betrothal present
is in the hand of such a one and a girl whom to look at is to love

That may be said Wei But my wish is to marry your sister

Will you go and talk to Tu about it said Jasmine who felt that the
subject was becoming too difficult for her and whose confidence in Tus
wisdom was unbounded and he will explain it all to you

Even Tu however found it somewhat difficult to explain Jasmines
sphinxlike mysteries and on certain points Wei showed a disposition
to be anything but satisfied Jasmines engagement to Tu implied his
rejection and he was disposed to be splenetic and disagreeable about
it His pride was touched and in his irritation he was inclined to
impute treachery to his friend and deceit to Jasmine To the first
charge Tu had a ready answer but the second was all the more annoying
because there was some truth in it However Tu was not in the humour to
quarrel and being determined to seek peace and ensue it he overlooked
Weis innuendos and made out the best case he could for his bride On
Miss Kings beauty virtues and ability he enlarged with a wealth of
diction and power of imagination which astonished himself and Jasmine
also to whom he afterward repeated the conversation Why Tu dear
said that artless maiden how can you know all this about Miss King
You have never seen her and I am sure I never told you half of all
this

Dont ask questions said the enraptured Tu Let it be enough for you
to know that Wei is as eager for the possession of Miss King as he
was for your sister and that he has promised to be my best man at our
wedding tomorrow

And Wei was as good as his word With every regard to ceremony and
ancient usage the marriage of Tu and Jasmine was celebrated in the
presence of relatives and friends who attracted by the novelty of the
antecedent circumstances came from all parts of the country to witness
the nuptials By Tus especial instructions also a prominence was
allowed to Wei which gratified his vanity and smoothed down the ruffled
feathers of his conceit

Jasmine thought that no time should be lost in reducing Miss King to the
same spirit of acquiescence to which Wei had been brought and on the
evening of her weddingday she broached the subject to Tu

I shall not feel Tu dear she said that I have gained absolution
for my many deceptions until that very forward Miss King has been talked
over into marrying Wei and I insist therefore she added with an
amount of hesitancy which reduced the demand to the level of a plaintive
appeal that we start tomorrow for Chengtu to see the young woman

Ho ho replied Tu intensely amused at her attempted bravado
These are brave words and I suppose that I must humbly register your
decrees

O Tu you know what I mean You know that like a child who takes a
delight in conquering toy armies I love to fancy that I can command so
strong a man as you are But Tu if you knew how absolutely I rely on
your judgment you would humour my folly and say yes

There was a subtle incense of love and flattery about this appeal
which backed as it was by a look of tenderness and beauty made it
irresistible and the arrangements for the journey were made in strict
accordance with Jasmines wishes

On arriving at the inn which was so full of chastening memories to
Jasmine Tu sent his card to Mr King who flattered by the attention
paid him by so eminent a scholar cordially invited Tu to his house

To what he said as Tu responding to his invitation entered
his receptionhall am I to attribute the honour of receiving your
illustrious steps in my mean apartments

I have heard said Tu that the beautiful Miss King is your
Excellencys cousin and having a friend who is desirous of gaining her
hand I have come to plead on his behalf

I regret to say replied King that your Excellency has come too
late as she has already received an engagement token from a Mr Wen
who passed here lately on his way to Peking

Mr Wen is a friend of mine also said Tu and it was because I knew
that his troth was already plighted that I ventured to come on behalf of
him of whom I have spoken

Mr Wen said King is a gentleman and a scholar and having given a
betrothal present he is certain to communicate with us direct in case
of any difficulty

Will you old gentleman a term of respect said Tu producing the
lines which Miss King had sent Jasmine just cast your eyes over these
verses written to Wen by your cousin Feeling most regretfully that he
was unable to fulfil his engagement Wen gave these to me as a testimony
of the truth of what I now tell you

King took the paper handed him by Tu and recognised at a glance his
cousins handwriting

Alas he said Mr Wen told us he was engaged but not believing him
I urged him to consent to marry my cousin If you will excuse me sir
he added I will consult with the lady as to what should be done

After a short absence he returned

My cousin is of the opinion he said that she cannot enter into any
new engagement until Mr Wen has come here himself and received back the
betrothal present which he gave her on parting

I dare not deceive you old gentleman and will tell you at once that
that betrothal present was not Wens but was my unworthy friend Weis
and came into Wens possession in a way that I need not now explain

Still said King my cousin thinks Mr Wen should present himself
here in person and tell his own story and I must say that I am of her
opinion

It is quite impossible that Mr Wen should return here replied Tu
but my stupid thorn wife is in the adjoining hostelry and would be
most happy to explain fully to Miss King Wens entire inability to play
the part of a husband to her

If your honourable consort would meet my cousin she I am sure will
be glad to talk the matter over with her

With Tus permission Miss Kings maid was sent to the inn to invite
Jasmine to call on her mistress The maid who was the same who had
acted as Miss Kings messenger on the former occasion glanced long and
earnestly at Jasmine Her features were familiar to her but she could
not associate them with any lady of her acquaintance As she conducted
her to Miss Kings apartments she watched her stealthily and became
more and more puzzled by her appearance Miss King received her with
civility and after exchanging wishes that each might be granted ten
thousand blessings Jasmine said smiling

Do you recognise Mr Wen

Miss King looked at her and seeing in her a likeness to her beloved
said

What relation are you to him lady

I am his very self said Jasmine

Miss King opened her eyes wide at this startling announcement and gazed
earnestly at her

_Haiyah_ cried her maid clapping her hands I thought there was
a wonderful likeness between the lady and Mr Wen But who would have
thought that she was he

But what made you disguise yourself in that fashion asked Miss King
in an abashed and somewhat vexed tone

My father was in difficulties said Jasmine and as it was necessary
that I should go to Peking to plead for him I dressed as a man for the
convenience of travel You will remember that in the first instance I
declined your flattering overtures but when I found that you persisted
in your proposal not being able to explain the truth I thought the
best thing to do was to hand you my friends betrothal present which I
had with me intending to return and explain matters And you will admit
that in one thing I was truthful

What was that asked the maid

Why answered Jasmine I said that if I did not marry your lady I
would never marry any woman

Well yes said the maid laughing you have kept your faith royally
there

The friend I speak of continued Jasmine has now taken his doctors
degree and this stupid husband and wife have come from Mienchu to make
you a proposal on his behalf

Miss King was not one who could readily take in an entirely new and
startling idea and she sat with a halfdazed look staring at
Jasmine without uttering a word If it had not been for the maid the
conversation would have ceased but that young woman was determined to
probe the matter to the bottom

You have not told us she said the gentlemans name And will you
explain why you call him your friend How could you be on terms of
friendship with him

From my childhood said Jasmine I have always dressed as a boy I
went to a boys school

_Haiyah_ interjected the maid

And afterward I joined my husband and this gentleman Mr Wei in a
readingparty

Didnt they discover your secret

No

Never

Never

Thats odd said the maid But will you tell us something about this
Mr Wei

Upon this Jasmine launched out in a glowing eulogy upon her friend
She expatiated with fervour on his youth good looks learning and
prospects and with such effect did she speak that Miss King who
began to take in the situation ended by accepting cordially Jasmines
proposal

And now lady you must stay and dine with me said Miss King when
the bargain was struck while my cousin entertains your husband in the
hall

At this meal the beginning of a friendship was formed between the two
ladies which lasted ever afterward though it was somewhat unevenly
balanced Jasmines stronger nature felt compassion mingled with liking
for the pretty dolllike Miss King while the young lady entertained the
profoundest admiration for her guest

There was nothing to delay the fulfilment of the engagement thus happily
arranged and at the next full moon Miss King had an opportunity of
comparing her bridegroom with the picture which Jasmine had drawn of
him

Scholars are plentiful in China but it was plainly impossible that men
of such distinguished learning as Tu and Wei should be left among
the unemployed and almost immediately after their marriage they were
appointed to important posts in the empire Tu rose rapidly to the
highest rank and died at a good old age viceroy of the metropolitan
province and senior guardian to the heir apparent Wei was not so
supremely fortunate but then as Tu used to say he had not a Jasmine
to help him




THE REVENGE OF HER RACE By Mary Beaumont


The low hedge where the creepers climbed divided the lawn and its
magnificent Wellingtonias from the meadow There was little grass to be
seen for it was at this time one vast profusion of delicate ixias of
every bright and tender shade

The evening was still and the air heavy with scent In a room opening
upon the veranda wreathed with whiteandscarlet passionflowers where
she could see the garden and the meadow and beyond all the Mountain
Beautiful lay a sick woman Her dark face was lovely as an autumn leaf
is lovelyhectic with the passing life Her eyes wandered to the upper
snows of the mountain from time to time resting upon the brownhaired
English girl who sat on a low stool by her side holding the frail hand
in her cool firm clasp

The invalid was speaking her voice was curiously sweet and there was a
peculiarity about the s and an occasional turn of the sentence which
told the listener that her English was an acquired language

I am glad he is not here she said slowly I do not want him to have
pain

But perhaps Mrs Denison you will be much better in a day or two and
able to welcome him when he comes back

No I shall not be here when he comes back and it is just as it should
be I asked him to turn round as he left the garden and I could see
him oh so well He looked kind and so beautiful and he waved to me
his hand Now he will come back and he will be sad He did not want
to leave me but the governor sent for him He will be sad and he will
remember that I loved him and some day he will be glad again She
smiled into the troubled face near her

The girl stroked the thick dark hair lovingly

Dont she implored it hurts me You are better tonight and the
children are coming in Mrs Denison closed her eyes and with her left
hand she covered her face

No not the children she whispered not my darlings I cannot bear
it I must see them no more She pressed her companions hand with a
sudden close pressure But you will help them Alice you will make
them English like youlike him We will not pretend tonight it is not
long that I shall speak to you I ask you to promise me to help them to
be English

Dear the girl urged they are such a delicious mixture of England
and New Zealandprettier sweeter than any mere English child could
ever be They are enchanting

But into the dying womans eyes leaped an eager flame

They must all be English no Maori she cried A violent fit of
coughing interrupted her and when the paroxysm was over she was
too exhausted to speak The English nurse Mrs Bentley an elderly
Yorkshire woman who had been with Mrs Denison since her first baby
came six years ago and who had in fact been Horace Denisons own
nursemaid came in and sent the agitated girl into the garden For you
havent had a breath of fresh air today she said

At the door Alice turned The large eyes were resting upon her with an
intent and solemn regard in which lay a message What was it she
thought as she passed through the wide hall sweet with flowers She
wanted to say something I am sure she did Tomorrow I will ask her
But before the morrow came she knew Mrs Dennison had said _goodbye_

The funeral was over Mr Denison who had looked unaccountably ill and
weary for months had been sent home by Mr Danby for at least a years
change and rest and the doctors young sister had yielded to various
pressure and promised to stay with the children until he returned
There was every reason for it She had loved and been loved by the
gentle Maori mother she delighted in the dark beauty and sweetness of
the children And they on their side clung to her as to an adorable
fairy relative dowered with love and the fruits of lovetales and new
games and tender ways Best reason of all in a sense Mrs Bentley
that kind autocrat entreated her to stay as the happiest thing for
the children and to please that poor lamb we laid yonder who fair
longed that you should She was mightily taken up with you Miss
Danby and youve your brother and his wife near so that you wont be
lonesome and if theres aught I can do to make you comfortable youve
only to speak miss As for Mr Denison he was pathetically grateful
and relieved when Alice promised to remain

After the evening romp and the last goodnight when the two elder
children Ben and Marie called after her mother Maritana had given
her their last injunctions to be sure and come for them her very own
self on her way down to breakfast in the morning she usually rode down
between the cabbagetrees down by the old rata fired last autumn
away through the grasslands to the doctors house a few miles nearer
Rochester or he and his wife would ride out to chat with her But there
were many evenings when she preferred the quiet of the airy house and
the garden The colonial life was new to her everything had its charm
and in the colonies there is always a letter to write to those at
homethe mailbag is never satisfied On such evenings it was her
custom to cross the meadow to the copse of feathery trees beyond where
sung to by the brook and the Tui the childrens mother slept And from
the high presence of the Mountain Beautiful there fell a dew of peace

She would often ask Mrs Bentley to sit with her until bedtime
and revel in the shrewd northcountry womans experiences and her
impressions of the new land to which love had brought her Both women
grew to have a sincere and trustful affection for each other and one
night seven or eight months after Mrs Denisons death Mrs Bentley
told a story which explained what had frequently puzzled Alicethe
patient sorrow in Mrs Denisons eyes and Mr Denisons harassed and
dejected manner But for your goodness to the children said the old
woman and the way that precious baby takes to you I dont think I
should be willing to say what I am going to do miss Though my dear
mistress wished it and said the very last night You must tell her
all about it some day Nanaand I promised to quiet herI dont
think I could bring myself to it if I hadnt lived with you and known
you And then the good nurse told her strange and moving tale

She described how her master had come out young and carelesshearted to
New Zealand in the service of the government and how scandalised and
angry his father and mother the old Tory squire and his wife had been
to receive from him after a year or two letters brimming with a boyish
love for his beautiful Maori princess whom he described as having
the sweetest heart and the loveliest eyes in the world It gave them
little comfort to hear that her father was one of the wealthiest Maoris
in the island and that though but half civilised himself he had had
his daughter well educated in the bishops and other English schools
To them she was a savage There was no threat of disinheritance for
there was nothing for him to inherit There was little money and the
estate was entailed on the elder brother But all that could be done
to intimidate him was done and in vain Then silence fell between the
parents and the son

But one spring day came the news of a grandson called Benjamin after
his grandfather and an urgent letter from their boy himself enclosing
a prettily and humbly worded note from the new strange daughter begging
for an English nurse She told them that she had now no father and no
mother for they had died before the baby came and if she might love
her husbands parents a little she would be glad

My lady read the letters to me herself Mrs Bentley said Id taken
the housekeepers place a bit before and she asked me to find her a
sensible young woman Well I tried but there wasnt a girl in the
place that was fit to nurse Master Horaces child And the end of it
was I came myself for Master Horace had been like my own when he was a
little lad My lady pretended to be vexed with me but the day I sailed
she thanked me in words I never thought to hear from her for she was
a bit proud always The faithful servants voice trembled She leaned
back in her chair and forgot for the moment the new house and the new
duties She was back again in the old nursery with the fairhaired
child playing about her knees But Alices face recalled her and she
continued the story She had she said dreaded the meeting with her new
mistress and was prepared to find her a sort of a heathen woman whod
pull down Master Horace till he couldnt call himself a gentleman

But when she saw the graceful creature who received her with gentle
words and gestures of kindliness and when she found her young master
not only content but happy and when she took in her arms the
laughing healthy baby she feltthough she regretted its dark eyes and
hairmore at home than she could have believed possible The nurseries
were so large and comfortable and so much consideration was shown to
her that she confessed I should have been more ungrateful than a cat
if I hadnt settled comfortable

Then came nearly five happy years during which time her young mistress
had found a warm and secure place in the good Yorkshire heart She was
that loving and that kind that Dick Burdas the groom used to say that
he believed she was an angel as had took up with them dark folks to
show em what an angel was like Mrs Bentley went on

She wasnt always quite happy and I wondered what brought the shadow
into her face and why she would at times sigh that deep that I could
have cried After a bit I knew what it was It was the Maori in her She
told me one night that she was a wicked woman and ought never to have
married Master Horace for she got tired sometimes of the English house
and its ways and longed for her fathers _whare_ thats a native hut
miss She grieved something awful one day when she had been to see old
Tim the Maori who lives behind the stables She called herself a bad
and ungrateful woman and thought there must be some evil spirit in her
tempting her into the old ways because when she saw Tim eating and
you know what bad stuff they eat she had fair longed to join him She
gave me a fright I didnt get over for nigh a week She leaned her bonny
head against my knee and I stroked her cheek and hummed some silly
nursery tunefor she was all of a tremble and like a childand she
fell asleep just where she was

Poor thing said Alice softly

Eh but its whats coming that upsets me maam Eh what suffering
for my pretty lamb and her that wouldnt have hurt a worm Baby would
be about six months old when she came in one day with him in her arms
and they _were_ a picture His little hand was fast in her hair She
always walked as if shed wheels on her feet that gliding and graceful
She had on a sort of sheeny yellow silk and her cheeks were like them
damask roses at home and her eyes fair shone like stars Isnt he a
beauty Nana she asked me If only he had blue eyes and that hair
of gold like my husbands and not these ugly eyes of mine And as she
spoke she sighed as I dreaded to hear Then she told me to help her to
unpack her new dress from Paris which she was to wear at the Rochester
races the next day Master Horace always chose her dresses and he was
right proud of her in them And next morning he came into the nursery
with her and she was all in pale red and that beautiful Isnt she
scrumptious Nana he said in his boyish way Dont spoil her dress
children How like her Marie grows Those two little ones they had got
her on her knees on the ground and were hugging her as if they couldnt
let her go But when he said that she got up very still and white

I am sorry she said they must never be like me

They cant be any one better can they baby he answered her and he
tossed the child nearly up to the ceiling But he looked worried as he
went out I saw them drive away and they looked happy enough And oh
miss I saw them come back We were in the porch me and the children
Master Horace lifted her down and I heard him say Never mind Marie
But she never looked his way nor ours she walked straight in and
upstairs to her room past my bonny darling with his arm stretched out
to her and past Miss Marie who was jumping up and down and shouting
Muvver and I heard her door shut Then Master Horace took baby from
me

Go up to her he said and I could scarce hear him His face was all
drawn like but I felt that silly and stupid that I could say nothing
and just went upstairs Mrs Bentley put her knitting down and
throwing her apron over her head sobbed aloud

O nurse what was it cried Alice and the colour left her cheeks Do
tell me I am so sorry for them What was it It was several minutes
before the good woman could recover herself then she began

She told me and Dick Burdas he told me and it was like this When
they got to the racecourseit was the first races theyd had in
Rochesterall the gentry was there and those that knew her always
made a deal of her she had such halfshy winning ways And she seemed
very bright Dick said talking with the governors lady who is full of
fun and sparkle The carriages were all together and Major Beaumont
a kind old gentleman whos always been a good friend to Master Horace
would have them in his carriage for luncheon or whatever it was Dick
says he was thinking that she was the prettiest lady there when his eye
was caught by two or three parties of Maoris setting themselves right
in front of the carriages There were four or five in each lot and they
were mostly old They got out their sharks flesh and that bad corn they
eat and began to make their meal of them Near Mrs Denison there
was one old man with a better sort of face and Dick heard her say to
master Isnt he like my father What Master Horace answered he didnt
hear he says he never saw anything like her face so sad and wild and
working for all the world as if something were fighting her within
Then all in a minute she ran out and slipped down in her beautiful
dress close by the old Maori in his dirty rags and was rubbing her
face against his as them folks do when they meet She had just taken
a mouthful of the raw fish when Master Horace missed her He hadnt
noticed her slip away But in a moment he seemed to understand what it
meant He saw the Maori come out strong in her face and he knew the
Maori had got the better of everything husband and friends and all
He gave a little cry and in a minute he had her on her feet and was
bringing her back to the carriage Some folks thought Dick Burdas
a rough hard man and I know he was a shocker of a lad he was fra
Whitby but that night he cried like a baby when he tell t me and
Mrs Bentley fell for a moment into the dialect of her youth

He said she continued that she looked like a poor stricken thing
condemned and let herself be led back as submissive as a child and
Master Horaces face was like the dead He didnt think any one but the
major and Dr Danby saw her go all was done in a minute But it was
done and some few had seen and it got out and things were said that
wasnt true Not the doctor No miss you neednt tell me that hes
told none that Ill warrant Hes faithful and hes close

O Mrs Bentley how dreadful for her how dreadful and the girl went
down on her knees by the old woman her tears flowing fast

Thats it miss you understand I feel like that It was bad enough
for Master Horace with the future before him and his children to
think of but for her it was desperate cruel Eh maam what she went
through She loved more than youd have thought us poor human beings
could And after all the nature was in her she didnt put it there
Ive had a deal to do to keep down sinful thoughts since then theres a
lot of things thats wrong in this world maam

What did she do Alice whispered

She She was for going away and leaving everything she felt herself
the worst woman in the world It was only by begging and praying of her
on my knees that I got her to stay in the house that night for she was
so far English and had such a fancy that she saw everything blacker
than any Englishwoman would even the particklerest Afterward Master
Horace was that good and gentle and she loved him so much that he
persuaded her to say nothing more about it and to try to live as if it
hadnt been And so she seemed to do outward like to other people But
it wasnt ever the same again Something had broken in them both with
him it was his trust and his pride but in her it was her heart

But the childrensurely they comforted her

Eh miss that was the worst Poor lamb poor lamb Never after that
day though they were more to her nor children ever were to a mother
before would she have them with her Just a morning and a goodnight
kiss and a quarter of an hour at most and I must take them away
She watched them play in the garden from her window or the little hill
there and when they were asleep she would sit by them for hours saying
how bonny they were and how good they were growing And she looked after
their clothes and their food and every little toy and pleasure but
never came in for a romp and a chat any more

Dear brave heart murmured the girl

Yes maam you feel for her I know She was fair terrified of them
turning Maori and shaming their father That was it You didnt notice
No after you came she was too ill to bear them about and it seemed
natural I dare say The Maoris are a fearful delicate set of folks A
bad cold takes them off into consumption directly And with her there
was the sorrow as well as the cold It was wonderful that she lived so
long

Alice threw her arms round Mrs Bentleys neck

O nurse it is all so dreadful and sad Couldnt we have somehow kept
her with us and made her happy

The old woman held her close Nay my dear bairn never after that
happened It or worse might have come again Its something stronger
in them than we know its the very blood Im thinking But shes gone
to be the angel that Dick always said she was

Alice looked away over the starlit garden to where the plumy trees
stirred in the night wind No she said fervently not gone to be
nurse dear she was an angel always Dick was right




KING BILLY OF BALLARAT By Morley Roberts


King Billy was given to strolling up and down the streets of Ballarat
when that eviscerated city was merely in process of disembowelment
before alluvial mining gave way to quartzcrushing when the individual
had a chance if a very vague one of sudden and delightful fortune The
Ballarat blacks were a scaly lot to talk of them like illfed hogs as
men were wont to do They dwined and dwindled as natives will before
the resources of civilisation the bloodthirsty ones got killed out
the rumthirsty ones died out the wild corroboree was reduced to a
povertystricken imitation of its former glory King Billys authority
grew less with the increase of his clothes The brass plate with his
name on it was about the last relic of his precarious power and was
chiefly valued as a means of notifying the public generally that they
might stand drinks to a monarch if they saw fit and were not too humble
He was not haughty and never presumed on his plate as parvenus will
He came of an ancient stock and could afford to condescend even if he
could not afford to pay for drinks He was very kind to childrenwhite
children of courseand was halefellowwellmet with many of them

He was particularly fond of Annie Colborn whose father was a magistrate
and a gold commissioner and a person of very great importance Whether
or not King Billy was wise in his generation and out of the unwritten
Scriptures of the somber bush had culled a maxim inculcating the wisdom
of making friends of the sons of Mammon I cannot say but he was always
good to Annie For my own part I do not believe the simplehearted old
king had any such notion inside his thick antipodean skull He was good
because he was not bad which is the very best morality after all and a
great advance on much we hear of And besides he was sometimes
hungry and Mr Colborns Chinese cook was very haughty and not to
be approached except through an intermediary And who so capable of
conciliating Wong as Annie Wong would make her cakes even when his
pigtail hung despondently from his aching head after an opium debauch
and his cheeks were shining with anything but gladness for if you get
drunk very often on opium you shine

Old Billy was mostly to be found where there was a chance of a drink
but if the fountains were dried up or he had been insulted by some
democratic revolutionary kinghating miner knocking his high hat down
over his eyes he usually went up to Mr Colborns place and sat on
the fence or on a log outside the gate So he was often very melancholy
when Annie came out One day his hat was very very badly bulged indeed

Your hat is very bad today King Billy said sixyearold Annie as
she stood in front of him critically with her head on one side Without
knowing it the child had come to look upon the state of the poor kings
hat as emblematical of his state of mind When it shut up like a closed
concertina his barometer was low

Yes missy said the king white man knock um over eyes andwith
a rub down his faceskin um nose

She inspected his nose carefullythough from a certain distance
because her own nose was very good both inside and out and she knew
the king never got washed unless it rained when he was very drunk And
this was the end of summer It had not rained since November

There is not very much skin off said Annie You had better wash it

The king made a wry face and changed the conversation

You got um hat Missy Annie One hat baal brokum allasame white
fellow hat Bad hat King Billy bad black fellow white fellow laugh

He peered into his hat and trying to straighten it out put his fist
through the side Poor Billy looked as if he could cry

You stop a minute said Annie and flying indoors she brought out a
very good high hat indeed Budgeree thought the king that was a good
hat He could go down the streets like a king indeed able to hold up
his head with any rich man in Ballarat He tried it on and though it
was much too big he knew it shone And the glory of a hat is in its
shining as much as its shape even a black fellow knows that

But that hat very nearly led to serious trouble For one thing Mr
Colborn missed it and never thinking Annie had given it away when
he saw the king sitting on the fence decorated with it he stopped and
interviewed him

Where did you get that hat you old thief asked the magistrate
without any politeness to him who ruled the land before white men broke
into the country Some in authority are polite to those they dispossess
the Prussians for instance to the miserable King Billys who strut
about the empire But the AngloSaxon only respects himself and even
that to a limited extent in new conquests

The question troubled King Billy greatly He did not know that Mr
Colborn would as soon have thought of murdering Annie as of bullying
her so he lied promptly Me buy um Mistah Cobon

Mr Colborn took it off of his head and saw that it was his as he had
thought What he would have said I do not know for just then he heard a
voice behind him

Papa it is my fault I gave it to King Billy

Colborn turned round and took her up letting fall the hat as he did
so Billy made a jump picked it up and in his agitation brushed it
carefully the wrong way

My dear if you gave it to him its all right But why didnt the old
fool tell me

Hes not an old fool papa and you must not say so Hes a good man
and I think he thought you would be angry with me Didnt you King
Billy And the king with a smile of conscious rectitude admitted it
was so

Mr Colborn gave him sixpence and he gave Annie a great many kisses
declaring with uncommon thoughtlessness that whatever she did was
right and that she could give the king all his house and Australia to
boot Whereon King Billy smiled a smile that was portentous and showed
his teeth to the uttermost recesses of his ample mouth Looking down he
surveyed the rest of his clothes which in parts resembled the childs
definition of a net as a lot of holes tied together with string and
looking up he inspected Mr Colborn as if estimating the resources of
his wardrobe But being urgently smitten with the necessity of getting
rid of his sixpence he shambled off into the town Other matters might
wait that admitted of no delay

The mind of King Billy was not a big mind it would no more have taken
in an abstract idea than his _gunyah_ would have accommodated a grand
piano He was as simple as sunlight and to resolve his intellect into
seven colours would want the most ingenious spectroscope But he could
make an inference from a positive fact and having made it he did not
allow more remote deductions to trouble his legitimate conclusion He
ceased to fear Mr Colborn and began to look upon the magistrates
property as if it were at least half his own So he got very drunk
on the hospitality of a new chum miner who had been successful and
presently presuming on his new possessions got into a fight with
his entertainer and a disrespectful subking of his own blacks and was
reduced to worse rags than ever

Next morning he sat outside the magistrates house on the lowest log he
could find and when Mr Colborn came out he tackled him with the air of
a subject king demanding redress of his suzerain

Well Billy what is it asked the suzerain

You belong gublement said Billy the king with a question an implied
doubt and a great complaint in his voice Colborn laughed

Why yes Billy I belong to the government I suppose

Then said Billy what you say to white fellow make um black fellow
drunk knock um all about Call you that gublement And he showed his
kingly robe which had once been a frockcoat with great disgust

However he met with no favour and was told that he should not get
drunkthat it served him right with which magisterial decision Colborn
got on his horse and rode off to the flat

The king sat down sadly and considered thickly in his slow brain
Annie did not come out and he knew better than to ask for her for Mr
Colborns niece who kept house for him was but newly come from home
and thought all black fellows congenital murderers which indeed they
are in some parts of the north So Billy sat and waited for he wanted a
new coat How could he be respected in one whose natural divisions were
unnaturally extended to the very neck It was obviously necessary to get
a new garment at once and the best chance of a good one lay in little
Annies kindness But in order to obviate the slightest chance of his
girl patrons refusing he must bring her some offering He went off
into the bush at the back of the town and coming to where three or
four black fellows were camped he sat down and talked with them In
spite of the heat a wretched old gin muffled up in her one garment
a ragged blanket held her hands over the few burning sticks which
represent an Australian natives idea of a fire Presently King Billy
rose and taking a tomahawk went farther into the bush He looked
about and at last came to a tree which he climbed native fashion
first discarding his clothes When near the first big branches he came
to a hole and putting in his hand he extracted a lively young possum
by the tail

Next morning he was sitting on the Colborns fence as usual At his
feet was a little box with two or three slats nailed roughly across it
Inside was the possum King Billy wondered what kind of a coat he could
get He liked a frockcoat there was something majestic about it
something fine and ample Common morning coats would not do no one
would insult a king by offering him tweed even little Annie knew
better than that especially if he gave her a live possum he had caught
himself And when Annie did come out she was in the seventh heaven of
delight with the possum and ready to bestow anything in the world on
King Billy

You give poor Billy one fellow coat missy and he go down along street
like a king

Annie flew into the house and seized the first garment she laid her
little hands on It was her fathers dresscoat She rolled it up and
running out thrust it excitedly into the kings black paw As he went
off she carried the possum indoors and was deliriously happy for
hours

King Billy hurried into the bush till he came to a waterhole and
stripping off his rags he held up the coat His jaw fell there was a
remarkable exiguity about the coat which was inexplicable He had never
observed such in his life He put it on and bending over the surface
of the still pool took a good look at the general effect It was not
bad from some points of view but Billy had his doubts as to whether
he would be received with the respect due to his title if he went into
Ballarat clothed thus He tried to button it but discovered that if it
had ever been intended for buttoning he could not get it to meet
across his chest He picked up his discarded frockcoat which was held
together by the collar then he felt the stuff of which the dresscoat
was made and the material pleased him Oh why asked Billy had it
not been made with front tails He saw at last that this coat and his
high hat alone were insufficient for civilisation For full dress in
a corroboree it might do Unconsciously he was so wrought upon by the
purpose for which the coat had been built that he determined to reserve
it for parties in the seclusion of the bush where any merriment could
be rightly checked by a crack from his waddy He planted it carefully
in a hollow log and having inserted himself with as much care into his
discarded rags he wondered off into the town He got very intoxicated
that night and determined to have a party all by himself

Now it may seem very annoying and I confess I find it so myself but
having got so far I dont see my way to tell the rest even if Annie
Colborn told me the story herself For after her fathers death she
married a man who had a small sheepstation and a hotel not forty miles
from Carabobla in New South Wales I stayed there a couple of days when
I was going north to the Murrumbidgee But though she told me I cannot
tell it again at least not in bold bad print Still it will occur
to most that a man of King Billys sweet and innocent disposition might
very likely create a sensation when his natural discretion was drowned
in bad whisky if he ended his solitary corroboree in the moonlight by
going up to Colborns house in order to deliver a speech of gratitude
through the French windows

So Colborn and the king had a corroboree all to themselves in the open
space before the house while the gold commissioners guests roared with
laughter to find out where the missing dresscoat was Next day King
Billy resumed the split frockcoat




THY HEARTS DESIRE By Netta Syrett


The tents were pitched in the little plain surrounded by hills Right
and left there were stretches of tender vivid green where the young
corn was springing farther still on either hand the plain was yellow
with mustardflower but in the immediate foreground it was bare and
stony A few thorny bushes pushed their straggling way through the dry
soil ineffectively as far as the grace of the landscape was concerned
for they merely served to emphasise the barren aridness of the land that
stretched before the tents sloping gradually to the distant hills

The hills were uninteresting enough in themselves they had no grandeur
of outline no picturesqueness even though at morning and evening the
sun like a great magician clothed them with beauty at a touch

They had begun to change to soften to blush rose red in the evening
light when a woman came to the entrance of the largest of the tents and
looked toward them She leaned against the support on one side of the
canvas flap and putting back her head rested that too against it
while her eyes wandered over the plain and over the distant hills

She was bareheaded for the covering of the tent projected a few feet to
form an awning overhead The gentle breeze which had risen with sundown
stirred the soft brown tendrils of hair on her temples and fluttered
her pink cotton gown a little She stood very still with her arms
hanging and her hands clasped loosely in front of her There was about
her whole attitude an air of studied quiet which in some vague fashion
the slight clasp of her hands accentuated Her face with its tightly
almost rigidly closed lips would have been quite in keeping with the
impression of conscious calm which her entire presence suggested had it
not been that when she raised her eyes a strange contradiction to this
idea was afforded They were large gray eyes unusually bright and
rather startling in effect for they seemed the only live thing about
her Gleaming from her still set face there was something almost
alarming in their brilliancy They softened with a sudden glow of
pleasure as they rested on the translucent green of the wheatfields
under the broad generous sunlight and then wandered to where the pure
vivid yellow of the mustardflower spread in waves to the base of the
hills now mystically veiled in radiance She stood motionless watching
their melting elusive changes from palpitating rose to the transparent
purple of amethyst The stillness of evening was broken by the
monotonous not unmusical creaking of a Persian wheel at some little
distance to the left of the tent The well stood in a little grove of
trees between their branches she could see when she turned her head
the coloured saris of the village women where they stood in groups
chattering as they drew the water and the little naked brown babies
that toddled beside them or sprawled on the hard ground beneath the
trees From the village of flatroofed mud houses under the low hill at
the back of the tents other women were crossing the plain toward the
well their terracotta waterjars poised easily on their heads casting
long shadows on the sunbaked ground as they came

Presently in the distance from the direction of the sunlit
hills opposite a little group of men came into sight Far off the
mustardcoloured jackets and the red turbans of the orderlies made vivid
splashes of colour on the dull plain As they came nearer the guns
slung across their shoulders the cases of mathematical instruments
the hammers and other heavy baggage they carried for the sahib became
visible A little in front at walking pace rode the sahib himself
making notes as he came in a book he held before him The girl at the
tent entrance watched the advance of the little company indifferently
it seemed except for a slight tightening of the muscles about her
mouth her face remained unchanged While he was still some little
distance away the man with the notebook raised his head and smiled
awkwardly as he saw her standing there Awkwardness perhaps best
describes the whole man He was badly put together loosejointed
ungainly The fact that he was tall profited him nothing for it merely
emphasised the extreme ungracefulness of his figure His long pale face
was made paler by the shock of coarse towcoloured hair his
eyes even looked colourless though they were certainly the least
uninteresting feature of his face for they were not devoid of
expression He had a way of slouching when he moved that singularly
intensified the general uncouthness of his appearance Are you very
tired asked his wife gently when he had dismounted close to the
tent The question would have been an unnecessary one had it been put
to her instead of to her husband for her voice had that peculiar flat
toneless sound for which extreme weariness is answerable

Well no my dear not very he replied drawling out the words with
an exasperating air of delivering a final verdict after deep reflection
on the subject

The girl glanced once more at the fading colours on the hills Come in
and rest she said moving aside a little to let him pass

She stood lingering a moment after he had entered the tent as though
unwilling to leave the outer air and before she turned to follow him
she drew a deep breath and her hand went for one swift second to her
throat as though she felt stifled

Later on that evening she sat in her tent sewing by the light of the
lamp that stood on her little table

Opposite to her her husband stretched his ungainly length in a
deckchair and turned over a pile of official notes Every now and
then her eyes wandered from the gay silks of the tablecover she was
embroidering to the canvas walls which bounded the narrow space into
which their few household goods were crowded Outside there was a deep
hush The silence of the vast empty plain seemed to work its way slowly
steadily in toward the little patch of light set in its midst The girl
felt it in every nerve it was as though some softfooted noiseless
shapeless creature whose presence she only dimly divined was
approaching nearer_nearer_ The heavy outer stillness was in some
way made more terrifying by the rustle of the papers her husband was
reading by the creaking of his chair as he moved and by the little
fidgeting grunts and halfexclamations which from time to time broke
from him His wifes hand shook at every unintelligible mutter from him
and the slight habitual contraction between her eyes deepened

All at once she threw her work down on to the table For heavens
sake_please_ John _talk_ she cried Her eyes for the moments
space in which they met the startled ones of her husband had a wild
hunted look but it was gone almost before his slow brain had time to
note that it had been thereand was vaguely disturbing She laughed a
little unsteadily

Did I startle you Im sorry Ishe laughed againI believe Im
a little nervous When one is all day alone She paused without
finishing the sentence The mans face changed suddenly A wave
of tenderness swept over it and at the same time an expression of
halfincredulous delight shone in his pale eyes

Poor little girl are you really lonely he said Even the real
feeling in his tone failed to rob his voice of its peculiarly irritating
grating quality He rose awkwardly and moved to his wifes side

Involuntarily she shrank a little and the hand which he had stretched
out to touch her hair sank to his side She recovered herself
immediately and turned her face up to his though she did not raise
her eyes but he did not kiss her Instead he stood in an embarrassed
fashion a moment by her side and then went back to his seat

There was silence again for some time The man lay back in his chair
gazing at his big clumsy shoes as though he hoped for some inspiration
from that quarter while his wife worked with nervous haste

Dont let me keep you from reading John she said and her voice had
regained its usual gentle tone

No my dear Im just thinking of something to say to you but I dont
seem

She smiled a little In spite of herself her lip curled faintly Dont
worry about it it was stupid of me to expect it I mean she added
hastily immediately repenting the sarcasm She glanced furtively at
him but his face was quite unmoved evidently he had not noticed it
and she smiled faintly again

O Kathie I knew there was _something_ Id forgotten to tell you my
dear theres a man coming down here I dont know whether

She looked up sharply A man coming _here_ What for she interrupted
breathlessly

Sent to help me about this oilboring business my dear

He had lighted his pipe and was smoking placidly taking long whiffs
between his words

Well impatiently questioned his wife fixing her bright eyes on his
face

Wellthats all my dear

She checked an exclamation But dont you know anything about himhis
name where he comes from what he is like She was leaning forward
against the table her needle with a long end of yellow silk drawn
halfway through her work held in her upraised hand her whole attitude
one of quivering excitement and expectancy

The man took his pipe from his mouth deliberately with a look of slow
wonder

Why Kathie you seem quite anxious I didnt know youd be so
interested my dear Wellanother long pull at his pipehis names
Brook_Brookfield_ I think He paused again This pipe doesnt draw
well a bit theres something wrong with it I shouldnt wonder he
added taking it out and examining the bowl as though struck with the
brilliance of the idea

The woman opposite put down her work and clinched her hands under the
table

Go on John she said presently in a tense vibrating voice his
name is Brookfield Well where does he come from

Straight from home my dear I believe He fumbled in his pocket and
after some time extricated a pencil with which he began to poke
the tobacco in the bowl in an ineffectual aimless fashion becoming
completely engrossed in the occupation apparently There was another
long pause The woman went on working or feigning to work for her
hands were trembling a good deal

After some moments she raised her head again John will you mind
attending to me one moment and answering these questions as quickly as
you can The emphasis on the last word was so faint as to be almost as
imperceptible as the touch of exasperated contempt which she could not
absolutely banish from her tone

Her husband looking up met her clear bright gaze and reddened like a
schoolboy

Whereabouts _from home_ does he come she asked in a studiedly
gentle fashion

Well from London I think he replied almost briskly for him though
he stammered and tripped over the words Hes a university chap I used
to hear he was clever I dont know about that Im sure he used to
chaff me I remember but

Chaff _you_ You have met him then

Yes my dearhe was fast relapsing into his slow drawl
againthat is I went to school with him but its a long time ago
Brookfieldyes that must be his name

She waited a moment then When is he coming she inquired abruptly

Let me seetodays

_Monday_ the word came swiftly between her set teeth

Ah yesMonday well reflectively _next_ Monday my dear

Mrs Drayton rose and began to pace softly the narrow passage between
the table and the tent wall her hands clasped loosely behind her

How long have you known this she said stopping abruptly O John
you _neednt_ consider its quite a simple question Today Yesterday

Her foot moved restlessly on the ground as she waited

I think it was the day before yesterday he replied

Then why in heavens name didnt you tell me before she broke out
fiercely

My dear it slipped my memory If Id thought you would be
interested

Interested She laughed shortly It _is_ rather interesting to hear
that after six months of thisshe made a quick comprehensive gesture
with her handone will have some one to speak tosome one It is the
hand of Providence it comes just in time to save me from She checked
herself abruptly

He sat staring up at her stupidly without a word

Its all right John she said with a quick change of tone gathering
up her work quietly as she spoke Im not madyet Youyou must get
used to these little outbreaks she added after a moment smiling
faintly and to do me justice I dont _often_ trouble you with them
do I Im just a little tired or its the heat orsomething Nodont
touch me she cried shrinking back for he had risen slowly and was
coming toward her

She had lost command over her voice and the shrill note of horror in it
was unmistakable The man heard it and shrank in his turn

Im so sorry John she murmured raising her great bright eyes to his
face They had not lost their goaded expression though they were full
of tears Im awfully sorry but Im just nervous and stupid and I
cant bear _any one_ to touch me when Im nervous



Heres Broomhurst my dear I made a mistake in his name after all
I find I told you _Brookfield_ I believe didnt I Well it isnt
Brookfield he says its Broomhurst

Mrs Drayton had walked some little distance across the plain to meet
and welcome the expected guest She stood quietly waiting while her
husband stammered over his incoherent sentences and then put out her
hand

We are very glad to see you she said with a quick glance at the
newcomers face as she spoke

As they walked together toward the tent after the first greetings she
felt his keen eyes upon her before he turned to her husband

Im afraid Mrs Drayton finds the climate trying he asked Perhaps
she ought not to have come so far in this heat

Kathie is often pale You _do_ look white today my dear he
observed turning anxiously toward his wife

Do I she replied The unsteadiness of her tone was hardly
appreciable but it was not lost on Broomhursts quick ears Oh I
dont think so I _feel_ very well

Ill come and see if theyve fixed you up all right said Drayton
following his companion toward the new tent that had been pitched at
some little distance from the large one

We shall see you at dinner then Mrs Drayton observed in reply to
Broomhursts smile as they parted

She entered the tent slowly and moving up to the table already laid
for dinner began to rearrange the things upon it in a purposeless
mechanical fashion

After a moment she sank down upon a seat opposite the open entrance and
put her hand to her head

What is the matter with me she thought wearily All the week Ive
been looking forward to seeing this man_any_ man _any one_ to take
off the edge of this She shuddered Even in thought she hesitated to
analyse the feeling that possessed her Well hes here and I think I
feel _worse_ Her eyes travelled toward the hills she had been used to
watch at this hour and rested on them with a vague unseeing gaze

Tired Kathie A penny for your thoughts my dear said her husband
coming in presently to find her still sitting there

Im thinking what a curious world this is and what an ironical vein
of humour the gods who look after it must possess she replied with a
mirthless laugh rising as she spoke

John looked puzzled

Funny my having known Broomhurst before you mean he said doubtfully



I was fishing down at Lynmouth this time last year Broomhurst said at
dinner You know Lynmouth Mrs Drayton Do you never imagine you hear
the gurgling of the stream I am tantalised already by the sound of it
rushing through the beautiful green gloom of those woods_arent_ they
lovely And _I_ havent been in this burntup spot as many hours as
youve had months of it

She smiled a little

You must learn to possess your soul in patience she said and glanced
inconsequently from Broomhurst to her husband and then dropped her eyes
and was silent a moment

John was obviously and a little audibly enjoying his dinner He sat
with his chair pushed close to the table and his elbows awkwardly
raised swallowing his soup in gulps He grasped his spoon tightly in
his bony hand so that its swollen joints stood out larger and uglier
than ever his wife thought

Her eyes wandered to Broomhursts hands They were well shaped and
though not small there was a look of refinement about them he had a
way of touching things delicately a little lingeringly she noticed
There was an air of distinction about his clearcut cleanshaven face
possibly intensified by contrast with Draytons blurred features and it
was perhaps also by contrast with the gray cuffs that showed beneath
Johns illcut drab suit that the linen Broomhurst wore seemed to her
particularly spotless

Broomhursts thoughts for his part were a good deal occupied with his
hostess

She was pretty he thought or perhaps it was that with the wide
dry lonely plain as a setting her fragile delicacy of appearance was
invested with a certain flowerlike charm

The silence here seems rather strange rather appalling at first when
one is fresh from a town he pursued after a moments pause but I
suppose youre used to it eh Drayton How do _you_ find life here
Mrs Drayton he asked a little curiously turning to her as he spoke

She hesitated a second Oh much the same as I should find it anywhere
else I expect she replied after all one carries the possibilities
of a happy life about with one dont you think so The Garden of Eden
wouldnt necessarily make my life any happier or less happy than a
howling wilderness like this It depends on ones self entirely

Given the right Adam and Eve the desert blossoms like the rose in
fact Broomhurst answered lightly with a smiling glance inclusive of
husband and wife you two dont feel as though youd been driven out of
Paradise evidently

Drayton raised his eyes from his plate with a smile of total
incomprehension

Great heavens what an Adam to select thought Broomhurst
involuntarily as Mrs Drayton rose rather suddenly from the table

Ill come and help with that packingcase John said rising in his
turn lumberingly from his place then we can have a smokeeh Kathie
dont mind if we sit near the entrance

The two men went out together Broomhurst holding the lantern for the
moon had not yet risen Mrs Drayton followed them to the doorway and
pushing the loopedup hanging farther aside stepped out into the cool
darkness

Her heart was beating quickly and there was a great lump in her throat
that frightened her as though she were choking

And I am his _wife_I _belong_ to him she cried almost aloud

She pressed both her hands tightly against her breast and set her
teeth fighting to keep down the rising flood that threatened to sweep
away her composure Oh what a fool I am What an hysterical fool of a
woman I am she whispered below her breath She began to walk slowly up
and down outside the tent in the space illumined by the lamplight as
though striving to make her outwardly quiet movements react upon the
inward tumult In a little while she had conquered she quietly entered
the tent drew a low chair to the entrance and took up a book just as
footsteps became audible A moment afterward Broomhurst emerged from the
darkness into the circle of light outside and Mrs Drayton raised her
eyes from the pages she was turning to greet him with a smile

Are your things all right

Oh yes more or less thank you I was a little concerned about a case
of books but it isnt much damaged fortunately Perhaps Ive some you
would care to look at

The books will be a godsend she returned with a sudden brightening
of the eyes I was getting _desperate_for books

What are you reading now he asked glancing at the volume that lay in
her lap

Its a Browning I carry it about a good deal I think I like to have
it with me but I dont seem to read it much

Are you waiting for a suitable optimistic moment Broomhurst inquired
smiling

Yes now that you mention it I think that must be why I am waiting
she replied slowly

And it doesnt comeeven in the Garden of Eden Surely the serpent
pessimism hasnt been insolent enough to draw you into conversation
with him he said lightly

There has been no one to converse with at allwhen John is away
I mean I think I should have liked a little chat with the serpent
immensely by way of a change she replied in the same tone

Ah yes Broomhurst said with sudden seriousness it must be
unbearably dull for you alone here with Drayton away all day

Mrs Draytons hand shook a little as she fluttered a page of her open
book

I should think it quite natural you would be irritated beyond endurance
to hear that alls right with the world for instance when you were
sighing for the long day to pass he continued

I dont mind the day so much its the evenings She abruptly checked
the swift words and flushed painfully I meanIve grown stupidly
nervous I thinkeven when John is here Oh you have no idea of the
awful _silence_ of this place at night she added rising hurriedly
from her low seat and moving closer to the doorway It is so close
isnt it she said almost apologetically There was silence for quite
a minute

Broomhursts quick eyes noted the silent momentary clinching of the
hands that hung at her side as she stood leaning against the support at
the entrance

But how stupid of me to give you such a bad impression of the campthe
first evening too Mrs Drayton exclaimed presently and her
companion mentally commended the admirable composure of her voice

Probably you will never notice that it _is_ lonely at all she
continued John likes it here He is immensely interested in his work
you know I hope _you_ are too If you are interested it is all quite
right I think the climate tries me a little I never used to be
stupidand nervous Ah heres John hes been round to the kitchen
tent I suppose

Been looking after that fellow cleanin my gun my dear John
explained shambling toward the deckchair

Later Broomhurst stood at his own tent door He looked up at the
starsown sky and the heavy silence seemed to press upon him like an
actual physical burden

He took his cigar from between his lips presently and looked at the
glowing end reflectively before throwing it away

Considering that she has been alone with him here for six months she
has herself very well in hand_very_ well in hand he repeated



It was Sunday morning John Drayton sat just inside the tent presumably
enjoying his pipe before the heat of the day His eyes furtively
followed his wife as she moved about near him sometimes passing close
to his chair in search of something she had mislaid There was colour
in her cheeks her eyes though preoccupied were bright there was a
lightness and buoyancy in her step which she set to a little dancing air
she was humming under her breath

After a moment or two the song ceased she began to move slowly
sedately and as if chilled by a raw breath of air the light faded
from her eyes which she presently turned toward her husband

Why do you look at me she asked suddenly

I dont know my dear he began slowly and laboriously as was his
wont I was thinkin how nice you lookedjest nowmuch better you
know but somehowhe was taking long whiffs at his pipe as usual
between each word while she stood patiently waiting for him to
finishsomehow you alter so my dearyoure quite pale again all
of a minute

She stood listening to him noticing against her will the more than
suspicion of cockney accent and the thick drawl with which the words
were uttered

His eyes sought her face piteously She noticed that too and stood
before him torn by conflicting emotions pity and disgust struggling in
a handtohand fight within her

Mr Broomhurst and I are going down by the well to sit its cooler
there Wont you come she said at last gently

He did not reply for a moment then he turned his head aside sharply
for him

No my dear thank you Im comfortable enough here he returned
huskily

She stood over him hesitating a second then moved abruptly to the
table from which she took a book

He had risen from his seat by the time she turned to go out and he
intercepted her timorously

Kathie give me a kiss before you go he whispered hoarsely II
dont often bother you

She drew her breath in deeply as he put his arms clumsily about her
but she stood still and he kissed her on the forehead and touched the
little wavy curls that strayed across it gently with his big trembling
fingers

When he released her she moved at once impetuously to the open doorway
On the threshold she hesitated paused a moment irresolutely and then
turned back

Shall Idoes your pipe want filling John she asked softly

No thank you my dear

Would you like me to stay read to you or anything

He looked up at her wistfully Nno thank you Im not much of a
reader you know my dearsomehow

She hated herself for knowing that there would be a my dear probably
a somehow in his reply and despised herself for the sense of
irritated impatience she felt by anticipation even before the words
were uttered

There was a moments hesitating silence broken by the sound of quick
firm footsteps without Broomhurst paused at the entrance and looked
into the tent

Arent you coming Drayton he asked looking first at Draytons wife
and then swiftly putting in his name with a scarcely perceptible pause
Too lazy But you Mrs Drayton

Yes Im coming she said

They left the tent together and walked some few steps in silence

Broomhurst shot a quick glance at his companions face

Anything wrong he asked presently

Though the words were ordinary enough the voice in which they were
spoken was in some subtle fashion a different voice from that in
which he had talked to her nearly two months ago though it would have
required a keen sense of nice shades in sound to have detected the
change

Mrs Draytons sense of niceties in sound was particularly keen but she
answered quietly Nothing thank you

They did not speak again till the trees round the stone well were
reached

Broomhurst arranged their seats comfortably beside it

Are we going to read or talk he asked looking up at her from his
lower place

Well we generally talk most when we arrange to read so shall we agree
to talk today for a change by way of getting some reading done she
rejoined smiling _You_ begin

Broomhurst seemed in no hurry to avail himself of the permission he
was apparently engrossed in watching the flecks of sunshine on Mrs
Draytons white dress The whirring of insects and the creaking of a
Persian wheel somewhere in the neighbourhood filtered through the hot
silence

Mrs Drayton laughed after a few minutes there was a touch of
embarrassment in the sound

The new plan doesnt answer Suppose you read as usual and let me
interrupt also as usual after the first two lines

He opened the book obediently but turned the pages at random

She watched him for a moment and then bent a little forward toward him

It is my turn now she said suddenly is anything wrong

He raised his head and their eyes met There was a pause I will be
more honest than you he returned yes there is

What

Ive had orders to move on

She drew back and her lips whitened though she kept them steady

When do you go

On Wednesday

There was silence again the man still kept his eyes on her face

The whirring of the insects and the creaking of the wheel had suddenly
grown so strangely loud and insistent that it was in a halfdazed
fashion she at length heard her name_Kathleen_

Kathleen he whispered again hoarsely

She looked him full in the face and once more their eyes met in a long
grave gaze

The mans face flushed and he half rose from his seat with an impetuous
movement but Kathleen stopped him with a glance

Will you go and fetch my work I left it in the tent she said
speaking very clearly and distinctly and then will you go on reading
I will find the place while you are gone

She took the book from his hand and he rose and stood before her

There was a mute appeal in his silence and she raised her head slowly

Her face was white to the lips but she looked at him unflinchingly and
without a word he turned and left her



Mrs Drayton was resting in the tent on Tuesday afternoon With the help
of cushions and some low chairs she had improvised a couch on which
she lay quietly with her eyes closed There was a tenseness however in
her attitude which indicated that sleep was far from her

Her features seemed to have sharpened during the last few days and
there were hollows in her cheeks She had been very ill for a long time
but all at once with a sudden movement she turned her head and buried
her face in the cushions with a groan Slipping from her place she fell
on her knees beside the couch and put both hands before her mouth to
force back the cry that she felt struggling to her lips

For some moments the wild effort she was making for outward calm which
even when she was alone was her first instinct strained every nerve and
blotted out sight and hearing and it was not till the sound was very
near that she was conscious of the ring of horses hoofs on the plain

She raised her head sharply with a thrill of fear still kneeling and
listened

There was no mistake The horseman was riding in hot haste for the thud
of the hoofs followed one another swiftly

As Mrs Drayton listened her white face grew whiter and she began to
tremble Putting out shaking hands she raised herself by the arms of
the foldingchair and stood upright

Nearer and nearer came the thunder of the approaching sound mingled
with startled exclamations and the noise of trampling feet from the
direction of the kitchen tent

Slowly mechanically almost she dragged herself to the entrance and
stood clinging to the canvas there By the time she had reached it
Broomhurst had flung himself from the saddle and had thrown the reins
to one of the men

Mrs Drayton stared at him with wide bright eyes as he hastened toward
her

I thought youyou are not she began and then her teeth began to
chatter I am so cold she said in a little weak voice

Broomhurst took her hand and led her over the threshold back into the
tent

Dont be so frightened he implored I came to tell you first I
thought it wouldnt frighten you so much asYourDrayton isvery ill
They are bringing him I

He paused She gazed at him a moment with parted lips then she broke
into a horrible discordant laugh and stood clinging to the back of a
chair

Broomhurst started back

Do you understand what I mean he whispered Kathleen for Gods
sake_dont_he is _dead_

He looked over his shoulder as he spoke her shrill laughter ringing in
his ears The white glare and dazzle of the plain stretched before him
framed by the entrance to the tent far off against the horizon there
were moving black specks which he knew to be the returning servants
with their still burden

They were bringing John Drayton home


One afternoon some months later Broomhurst climbed the steep lane
leading to the cliffs of a little English village by the sea He had
already been to the inn and had been shown by the proprietress the
house where Mrs Drayton lodged

The lady was out but the gentleman would likely find her if he went
to the cliffsdown by the bay or thereabouts her landlady explained
and obeying her directions Broomhurst presently emerged from the shady
woodland path on to the hillside overhanging the sea

He glanced eagerly round him and then with a sudden quickening of the
heart walked on over the springy heather to where she sat She turned
when the rustling his footsteps made through the bracken was near enough
to arrest her attention and looked up at him as he came Then she rose
slowly and stood waiting for him He came up to her without a word and
seized both her hands devouring her face with his eyes Something he
saw there repelled him Slowly he let her hands fall still looking
at her silently You are not glad to see me and I have counted the
hours he said at last in a dull toneless voice

Her lips quivered Dont be angry with meI cant help itIm not
glad or sorry for anything now she answered and her voice matched his
for grayness

They sat down together on a long flat stone half embedded in a wiry
clump of whortleberries Behind them the lonely hillsides rose
brilliant with yellow bracken and the purple of heather Before them
stretched the wide sea It was a soft gray day Streaks of pale
sunlight trembled at moments far out on the water The tide was rising
in the little bay above which they sat and Broomhurst watched the lazy
foamedged waves slipping over the uncovered rocks toward the shore
then sliding back as though for very weariness they despaired of
reaching it The muffled pulsing sound of the sea filled the silence
Broomhurst thought suddenly of hot Eastern sunshine of the whir of
insect wings on the still air and the creaking of a wheel in the
distance He turned and looked at his companion

I have come thousands of miles to see you he said arent you going
to speak to me now I am here

Why did you come I told you not to come she answered falteringly
I she paused

And I replied that I should follow youif you remember he answered
still quietly I came because I would not listen to what you said then
at that awful time You didnt know _yourself_ what you said No wonder
I have given you some months and now I have come

There was silence between them Broomhurst saw that she was crying her
tears fell fast on to her hands that were clasped in her lap Her face
he noticed was thin and drawn

Very gently he put his arm round her shoulder and drew her nearer to
him She made no resistance it seemed that she did not notice the
movement and his arm dropped at his side

You asked me why I had come You think it possible that three months
can change one very thoroughly then he said in a cold voice

I not only think it possible I have proved it she replied wearily

He turned round and faced her

You _did_ love me Kathleen he asserted You never said so in words
but I know it he added fiercely

Yes I did

Andyou mean that you dont now

Her voice was very tired Yes I cant help it she answered it has
goneutterly

The gray sea slowly lapped the rocks Overhead the sharp scream of a
gull cut through the stillness It was broken again a moment afterward
by a short hard laugh from the man

Dont she whispered and laid a hand swiftly on his arm Do you
think it isnt worse for me I wish to God I _did_ love you she cried
passionately Perhaps it would make me forget that to all intents and
purposes I am a murderess

Broomhurst met her wide despairing eyes with an amazement which yielded
to sudden pitying comprehension

So that is it my darling You are worrying about _that_ You who were
as loyal as

She stopped him with a frantic gesture

Dont _dont_ she wailed If you only knew Let me try to tell
youwill you she urged pitifully It may be better if I tell some
oneif I dont keep it all to myself and think and _think_

She clasped her hands tight with the old gesture he remembered when she
was struggling for selfcontrol and waited a moment

Presently she began to speak in a low hurried tone It began
before you came I know now what the feeling was that I was afraid to
acknowledge to myself I used to try and smother it I used to repeat
things to myself all daypoems stupid rhymes_anything_ to keep my
thoughts quite underneathbut I_hated_ John before you came We had
been married nearly a year then I never loved him Of course you are
going to say Why did you marry him She looked drearily over the
placid sea Why _did_ I marry him I dont know for the reason that
hundreds of ignorant inexperienced girls marry I suppose My home
wasnt a happy one I was miserable and oh_restless_ I wonder if
men know what it feels like to be restless Sometimes I think they
cant even guess John wanted me very badly nobody wanted me at home
particularly There didnt seem to be any point in my life Do you
understand    Of course being alone with him in that little camp
in that silent plainshe shudderedmade things worse My nerves went
all to pieces Everything he said his voice his accent his walk
the way he ate irritated me so that I longed to rush out sometimes and
shriekand go _mad_ Does it sound ridiculous to you to be driven mad
by such trifles I only know I used to get up from the table sometimes
and walk up and down outside with both hands over my mouth to keep
myself quiet And all the time I _hated_ myselfhow I hated myself I
never had a word from him that wasnt gentle and tender I believe he
loved the ground I walked on Oh it is _awful_ to be loved like that
when you She drew in her breath with a sob IIit made me sick
for him to come near meto touch me She stopped a moment

Broomhurst gently laid his hand on her quivering one Poor little
girl he murmured

Then _you_ came she said and before long I had another feeling
to fight against At first I thought it couldnt be true that I loved
youit would die down I think I was _frightened_ at the feeling I
didnt know it hurt so to love any one

Broomhurst stirred a little Go on he said tersely

But it didnt die she continued in a trembling whisper and the
other _awful_ feeling grew stronger and strongerhatred no that is
not the word_loathing_ forforJohn I fought against it Yes she
cried feverishly clasping and unclasping her hands Heaven knows I
fought it with all my strength and reasoned with myself andoh I did
_everything_ but Her quickfalling tears made speech difficult

Kathleen Broomhurst urged desperately you couldnt help it you
poor child You say yourself you struggled against your feelings You
were always gentle perhaps he didnt know

But he didhe _did_ she wailed it is just that I hurt him
a hundred times a day he never said so but I knew it and yet I
_couldnt_ be kind to himexcept in wordsand he understood
And after you came it was worse in one way for he knewI _felt_ he
knewthat I loved you His eyes used to follow me like a dogs and
I was stabbed with remorse and I tried to be good to him but I
couldnt

Buthe didnt suspecthe trusted you began Broomhurst He had
every reason No woman was ever so loyal so

Hush she almost screamed Loyal it was the least I could doto
stop you I meanwhen youAfter all I knew it without your telling
me I had deliberately married him without loving him It was my own
fault I felt it Even if I couldnt prevent his knowing that I hated
him I could prevent _that_ It was my punishment I deserved it for
_daring_ to marry without love But I didnt spare John one pang after
all she added bitterly He knew what I felt toward him I dont
think he cared about anything else You say I mustnt reproach myself
When I went back to the tent that morningwhen youwhen I stopped
you from saying you loved me he was sitting at the table with his head
buried in his hands he was cryingbitterly I saw himit is terrible
to see a man cryand I stole away gently but he saw me I was torn
to pieces but I _couldnt_ go to him I knew he would kiss me and I
shuddered to think of it It seemed more than ever not to be borne that
he should do thatwhen I knew _you_ loved me

Kathleen cried her lover again dont dwell on it all so
terriblydont

How can I forget she answered despairingly And thenshe lowered
her voiceoh I cant tell youall the time at the back of my mind
somewhere there was a burning wish that he might _die_ I used to lie
awake at night and do what I would to stifle it that thought used to
_scorch_ me I wished it so intensely Do you believe that by willing
one can bring such things to pass she asked looking at Broomhurst
with feverishly bright eyes No Well I dont know I tried to smother
itI _really_ triedbut it was there whatever other thoughts I
heaped on the top Then when I heard the horse galloping across
the plain that morning I had a sick fear that it was _you_ I knew
something had happened and my first thought when I saw you alive and
well and knew it was _John_ was _that it was too good to be true_ I
believe I laughed like a maniac didnt I    Not to blame Why if
it hadnt been for me he wouldnt have died The men say they saw him
sitting with his head uncovered in the burning sun his face buried in
his handsjust as I had seen him the day before He didnt trouble to
be careful he was too wretched

She paused and Broomhurst rose and began to pace the little hillside
path at the edge of which they were seated

Presently he came back to her

Kathleen let me take care of you he implored stooping toward her
We have only ourselves to consider in this matter Will you come to me
at once

She shook her head sadly

Broomhurst set his teeth and the lines round his mouth deepened He
threw himself down beside her on the heather

Dear he urged still gently though his voice showed he was
controlling himself with an effort you are morbid about this You
have been alone too much you are ill Let me take care of you I _can_
Kathleenand I love you Nothing but morbid fancy makes you imagine
you are in any way responsible forDraytons death You cant bring him
back to life and

No she sighed drearily and if I could nothing would be altered
Though I am mad with selfreproach I feel _that_it was all so
inevitable If he were alive and well before me this instant my feeling
toward him wouldnt have changed If he spoke to me he would say my
dearand I should _loathe_ him Oh I know It is _that_ that makes it
so awful

But if you acknowledge it Broomhurst struck in eagerly will you
wreck both of our lives for the sake of vain regrets Kathleen you
never will

He waited breathlessly for her answer

I wont wreck both our lives by marrying again without love on my
side she replied firmly

I will take the risk he said You _have_ loved me you will love
me again You are crushed and dazed now with brooding over thisthis
trouble but

But I will not allow you to take the risk Kathleen answered What
sort of woman should I be to be willing again to live with a man I
dont love I have come to know that there are things one owes to _ones
self_ Selfrespect is one of them I dont know how it has come to be
so but all my old feeling for you has _gone_ It is as though it had
burned itself out I will not offer gray ashes to any man

Broomhurst looking up at her pale set face knew that her words were
final and turned his own aside with a groan

Ah cried Kathleen with a little break in her voice _dont_ Go
away and be happy and strong and all that I loved in you I am so
sorryso sorry to hurt you I her voice faltered miserably II
only bring trouble to people

There was a long pause

Did you never think that there is a terrible vein of irony running
through the ordering of this world she said presently It is a
mistake to think our prayers are not answeredthey are In due time we
get our hearts desirewhen we have ceased to care for it

I havent yet got mine Broomhurst answered doggedly and I shall
never cease to care for it

She smiled a little with infinite sadness

Listen Kathleen he said They had both risen and he stood before
her looking down at her I will go now but in a years time I shall
come back I will not give you up You shall love me yet

PerhapsI dont think so she answered wearily

Broomhurst looked at her trembling lips a moment in silence then he
stooped and kissed both her hands instead

I will wait till you tell me you love me he said

She stood watching him out of sight He did not look back and she
turned with swimming eyes to the gray sea and the transient gleams of
sunlight that swept like tender smiles across its face
