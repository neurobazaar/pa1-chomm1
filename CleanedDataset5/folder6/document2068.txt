CHAPTER I

IN WHICH KEZIAH HEARS TWO PROPOSALS AND THE BEGINNING OF A THIRD


Trumet in a fog a fog blown in during the night by the wind from the
wide Atlantic So wet and heavy that one might taste the salt in it
So thick that houses along the main road were but dim shapes behind
its gray drapery and only the gates and fences of the front yards
were plainly in evidence to the passersby The beach plum and bayberry
bushes on the dunes were spangled with beady drops The pole on Cannon
Hill where the beacon was hoisted when the packet from Boston dropped
anchor in the bay was shiny and slippery The new weathervane a
gilded whale presented to the Regular church by Captain Zebedee Mayo
retired whaler swam in a sea of cloud The lichened eaves of the little
ComeOuter chapel dripped at sedate intervals The brick walk leading
to the door of Captain Elkanah Danielss fine residence held undignified
puddles in its hollows And through the damp stillness the muttered
growl of the surf three miles away at the foot of the sandy bluffs by
the lighthouse sounded ominously

Directly opposite Captain Elkanahs front gate on the other side of the
main road stood the little storyandahalf house also the captains
property which for fourteen years had been tenanted by Mrs Keziah
Coffin and her brother Solomon Hall the shoemaker But Solomon had
the month before given up his fight with debt and illness and was
sleeping quietly in Trumets most populous center the graveyard And
Keziah left alone had decided that the rent and living expenses were
more than her precarious earnings as a seamstress would warrant and
having bargained with the furniture dealer in Wellmouth for the sale of
her household effects was now busy getting them ready for the morrow
when the dealers wagon was to call She was going to Boston where a
distant and condescending rich relative had interested himself to the
extent of finding her a place as sewing woman in a large tailoring
establishment

The fog hung like a wet blanket over the house and its small yard where
a few venerable pear trees too conservative in their old age to venture
a bud even though it was almost May stood bare and forlorn The day was
dismal The dismantled dining room its tables and chairs pushed into a
corner and its faded ingrain carpet partially stripped from the floor
was dismal likewise Considering all things one might have expected
Keziah herself to be even more dismal But to all outward appearances
she was not A large portion of her thirtynine years of life had been
passed under a wet blanket so to speak and she had not permitted
the depressing covering to shut out more sunshine than was absolutely
necessary If you cant get cream you might as well learn to love your
sasser of skim milk said practical Keziah

She was on her knees her calico dress sleeves patched and darned but
absolutely clean rolled back uncovering a pair of plump strong arms
a saucer of tacks before her and a tack hammer with a claw head in
her hand She was taking up the carpet Grace Van Horne Captain Eben
Hammonds ward who had called to see if there was anything she might do
to help was removing towels tablecloths and the like from the drawers
in a tall highboy folding them and placing them in an old and
battered trunk The pair had been discussing the subject which all
Trumet had discussed for three weeks namely the calling to the
pastorate of the Regular church of the Rev John Ellery the young
divinity student who was to take the place of old Parson Langley
minister in the parish for over thirty years Discussion in the village
had now reached a critical point for the Reverend John was expected
by almost any coach In those days the days of the late fifties the
railroad down the Cape extended only as far as Sandwich passengers made
the rest of their journey by stage Many came direct from the city by
the packet the little schooner but Mr Ellery had written that he
should probably come on the coach

They say hes very nicelooking remarked Miss Van Horne soberly
but with a MISCHIEVOUS glance under her dark lashes at Keziah The lady
addressed paused long enough to transfer several tacks from the floor to
the saucer and then made answer

Humph she observed A good many years ago I saw a theater show up
to Boston Dont be shocked those circumstances we hear so much tell
ofthe kind you cant controlhave kept me from goin to theaters
much even if I wanted to But I did see this entertainment and a fool
one twas too all singin instead of talkinopra I believe they
called it Well as I started to say one of the leadin folks in it was
the Old Harry himself and HE was pretty goodlookin

Grace laughed even though she had been somewhat shocked

Why Aunt Keziah she exclaimedthose who knew Keziah Coffin
best usually called her aunt though real nephews and nieces she had
nonewhy Aunt Keziah What do you mean by comparing thethe person
you just mentioned with a MINISTER

Oh I wasnt comparin em Ill leave that for you ComeOuters to do
Drat this carpet Seemss if I never saw such long tacks I do believe
whoever put em down drove em clean through the center of the earth and
let the Chinymen clinch em on tother side I haul up a chunk of the
cellar floor with every one Ah hum with a sigh I callate
they aint any more anxious to leave home than I am But fars the
ministers concerned didnt I hear of your Uncle Eben sayin in prayer
meetin only a fortnit or so ago that all hands who want ComeOuters
were own children to Satan Mr Ellery must take after his father some
Surprisin aint it what a family the old critters got

The girl laughed again For one brought up since her seventh year
in the strictest of ComeOuter families she laughed a good deal Many
ComeOuters considered it wicked to laugh Yet Grace did it and hers
was a laugh pleasant to hear and distinctly pleasant to see It made her
prettier than ever a fact which if she was aware of it should have
been an additional preventive for to be pretty smacks of vanity
Perhaps she wasnt aware of it

What do you think Uncle Eben would say if he heard that she asked

Say I took after my father too I presume likely Does your uncle know
you come here to see me so often And call me aunt and all that

Of course he does Aunt Keziah you mustnt think Uncle Eben doesnt
see the good in people simply because they dont believe as he does
Hes as sweet and kind as

Who Eben Hammond Land sakes child dont I know it Capn Ebens the
salt of the earth Im a Regular and always have been but Id be glad
if my own society was seasoned with a few like him Twould taste better
to me of a Sunday She paused and then added quizzically What dyou
spose Capn Elkanah and the rest of our parish committee would say if
they heard THAT

Goodness knows Still Im glad to hear you say it And uncle says you
are as good a woman as ever lived He thinks youre misled of course
but that some day youll see the error of your ways

Humph Ill have to hurry up if I want to see em without spectacles
See my errors Land sakes much as I can do to see the heads of these
tacks Takin up carpets is as hard a test of a bodys eyesight as tis
of their religion

Her companion put down the tablecloth she was folding and looked
earnestly at the other woman To an undiscerning eye the latter would
have looked much as she always didplump and matronly with brown hair
drawn back from the forehead and parted in the middle keen brown eyes
with a humorous twinkle in themthis was the Keziah Coffin the later
generation of Trumet knew so well

But Grace Van Horne who called her aunt and came to see her so
frequently while her brother was alive and during the month following
his death could see the changes which the month had wrought She saw
the little wrinkles about the eyes and the lines of care about the
mouth the tired look of the whole plucky workaday New England figure
She shook her head

Religion she repeated I do believe Aunt Keziah that youve got
the very best religion of anybody I know I dont care if you dont
belong to our church When I see how patient youve been and how
cheerful through all your troubles it

Mrs Coffin waved the hammer deprecatingly There there she
interrupted I guess its a good thing Im goin away Heres you and I
praisin up each others beliefs just as if that wasnt a crime here
in Trumet Sometimes when I see how the two societies in this little
onehorse place row with each other I declare if it doesnt look as if
theyd crossed out the first word of Love your neighbor and wrote in
Fight instead Yet Im a pretty good Regular too and when it comes
to whoopin and carryin on like the ComeOuters IWell well
never mind dont begin to bristle up I wont say another word about
religion Lets pick the new minister to pieces ANY kind of a Christian
can do that

But the new minister was destined to remain undissected that morning
in that house at least Grace was serious now and she voiced the matter
which had been uppermost in her mind since she left home

Aunt Keziah she said why do you go away What makes you Is it
absolutely necessary

Why do I go Why for the same reason that the feller that was hove
overboard left the shipcause I cant stay Youve got to have vittles
and clothes even in Trumet and a place to put your head in nights
Longs Sol was alive and could do his cobblin we managed to get along
somehow What I could earn sewin helped and we lived simple But when
he was taken down and died the doctors bills and the undertakers used
up what little money I had put by and the sewin alone wouldnt keep
a healthy canary in bird seed Dear land knows I hate to leave the old
house Ive lived in for fourteen years and the town I was born in but
Ive got to for all I see Thank mercy I can pay Capn Elkanah his
last months rent and go with a clear conscience I wont owe anybody
thats a comfort and nobody will owe me though I could stand that I
guess she added prying at the carpet edge

I dont care The girls dark eyes flashed indignantly I think its
too bad of Capn Elkanah to turn you out when

Dont talk that way He aint turnin me out He aint lettin houses
for his health and hell need the money to buy his daughters summer
rigs She aint had a new dress for a month pretty near and heres
a young and goodlookin parson heavin in sight Maybe Capn Elkanah
would think a minister was hightoned enough even for Annabel to marry

Hes only twentythree they say remarked Grace a trifle
maliciously Perhaps shell adopt him

Annabel was the only child of Captain Elkanah Daniels who owned the
finest house in town She was the belle of Trumet and had been for a
good many years

Keziah laughed

Well she said anyhow Ive got to go Maybe Ill like Boston first
rate you cant tell Or maybe I wont Ah hum twouldnt be the first
thing Ive had to do that I didnt like

Her friend looked at her

Aunt she said I want to make a proposal to you and you mustnt be
cross about it

A proposal Sakes alive Whatll I say This is so sudden Thats
what Becky Ryder up to the west part of the town said when Jim Baker
the tin peddler happened to ask her if shed ever thought of gettin
married O James this is so sudden says Becky Jim said afterwards
that the suddenest thing about it was the way he cleared out of that
house And he never called there afterwards

Grace smiled but quickly grew grave

Now auntie she said please listen Im in earnest It seems to me
that you might do quite well at dressmaking here in town if you had
a littlewell ready money to help you at the start Ive got a few
hundred dollars in the bank presents from uncle and my fathers
insurance money I should love to lend it to you and I know uncle
would

Mrs Coffin interrupted her

Cats foot she exclaimed I hope I havent got where I need to
borrow money yet a while Thank you just as much deary but longs Ive
got two hands and a mouth Ill make the two keep tother reasonably
full I wouldnt wonder No I shant think of it so dont say another
word NO

The negative was so decided that Grace was silenced Her disappointment
showed in her face however and Keziah hastened to change the subject

How do you know she observed but what my goin to Boston may be the
best thing that ever happened to me You cant tell No use despairin
Annabel aint given up hope yet why should I Hey Aint that somebody
comin

Her companion sprang to her feet and ran to the window Then she broke
into a smothered laugh

Why its Kyan Pepper she exclaimed He must be coming to see you
Aunt Keziah And hes got on his very best Sunday clothes Gracious I
must be going I didnt know you expected callers

Keziah dropped the tack hammer and stood up

Kyan she repeated What in the world is that old idiot comin here
for To talk about the minister I spose How on earth did Laviny ever
come to let him out alone

Mr Pepper Mr Abishai Pepper locally called Kyan Cayenne Pepper
because of his red hair and thin red side whiskers was one of Trumets
characters and in his case the character was weak He was born in the
village and when a youngster had like every other boy of good family
in the community cherished ambitions for a seafaring life His sister
Lavinia ten years older than he who after the death of their parents
had undertaken the job of bringing up her brother did not sympathize
with these ambitions Consequently when Kyan ran away she followed him
to Boston stalked aboard the vessel where he had shipped and collared
him literally and figuratively One of the mates venturing to offer
objection Lavinia turned upon him and gave him a piece of her mind to
the immense delight of the crew and the loungers on the wharf Then she
returned with the vagrant to Trumet Old Captain Higgins who skippered
the packet in those days swore that Lavinia never stopped lecturing her
brother from the time they left Boston until they dropped anchor behind
the breakwater

I give you my word that twas pretty nigh a stark calm but there was
such a steady stream of language pourin out of the Pepper stateroom
that the draught kept the sails filled all the way home asserted
Captain Higgins

That was Kyans sole venture so far as sailoring was concerned but he
ran away again when he was twentyfive This time he returned of his
own accord bringing a wife with him one Evelyn Gott of Ostable Evelyn
could talk a bit herself and her first interview with Lavinia ended
with the latters leaving the house in a rage swearing never to set
foot in it again This oath she broke the day of her sisterinlaws
funeral Then she appeared after the ceremony her baggage on the wagon
with her The bereaved one who was sitting on the front stoop of his
dwelling with so people say a most resigned expression on his meek
countenance looked up and saw her

My land Laviny he exclaimed turning pale Whered you come from

Never mind WHERE I come from observed his sister promptly You just
be thankful Ive come If ever a body needed some one to take care of
em its you You can tote my things right in she added turning to
her grinning driver and you Bishy go right in with em The idea
of your settin outside takin it easy when your poor wife aint been
buried moren an hour

ButbutLaviny protested poor Kyan speaking the truth unwittingly
I couldnt take it easy AFORE she was buried could I

Go right in was the answer March

Abishai marched and had marched under his sisters orders ever since
She kept house for him and did it well but her one fear was that some
female might again capture him and she watched him with an eagle
eye He was the town assessor and tax collector but when he visited
dwellings containing single women or widows Lavinia always accompanied
him to help him in his figgerin she said

Consequently when he appeared unchaperoned on the walk leading to the
side door of the Coffin homestead Keziah and her friend were surprised

Hes dressed to kill whispered Grace at the window Even his tall
hat and in this fog I do believe hes coming courting Aunt Keziah

Humph was the ungracious answer Hes come to say goodby I spose
and to find out where Im goin and how much pay Im goin to get and if
my rents settled and a few other little things that aint any of
his business Laviny put him up to it you see Shell be along pretty
quick Well Ill fix him so he wont talk much He can help us take
down that stovepipe I said twas a job for a man and a half ones
better than noneWhy how dye do Bishy Come right in Pretty thick
outside isnt it

Mr Pepper entered diffidently

Ererhow dye do Keziah he stammered I thought Id just run in
a minute and

Yes yes Glad to see you Take off your hat My sakes its pretty
wet How did Laviny come to let youI mean howd you come to wear a
beaver such a mornins this

Kyan removed the silk hat and inspected its limp grandeur ruefully

II he began Well the fact is I come out by myself You see
Lavinys gone up to Sarah Bs to talk church doins IIwell I kind
of wanted to speak with you about somethin Keziah soOh I didnt
see you Gracie Good mornin

He didnt seem overjoyed to see Miss Van Horne as it was In fact
he reddened perceptibly and backed toward the door The girl her eyes
twinkling took up her jacket and hat

Oh Im not going to stop Mr Pepper she said I was only helping
Aunt Keziah a little thats all I must run on now

Run onnonsense declared Keziah decisively Youre goin to stay
right here and help us get that stovepipe down And Bishyll help too
Wont you Bish

The stovepipe was attached to the airtight in the dining room
Itthe piperose perpendicularly for a few feet and then extended
horizontally over the highboy until it entered the wall Kyan looked
at it and then at his Sunday clothes

Why Id be glad to of course he declared with dubious enthusiasm
But I dont knows Ill have time Perhaps Id better come later and do
it Laviny she

Oh Laviny can spare you for a few minutes I guess specially as she
dont know youre out Better take your coat off hadnt you Grace
fetch one of those chairs for Kyfor Bishy to stand in

Grace obediently brought the chair It happened to be the one with a
rickety leg but its owner was helping the reluctant Abishai remove the
longtailed blue coat which had been his wedding garment and had adorned
his person on occasions of ceremony ever since She did not notice the
chair

Its real good of you to offer to help she said Grace and I didnt
hardly dast to try it alone That pipes been up so long that I wouldnt
wonder if twas chockfull of soot If youre careful though I dont
believe youll get any on you Never mind the floor Im goin to wash
that before I leave

Reluctantly slowly the unwilling Mr Pepper suffered himself to be led
to the chair He mounted it and gingerly took hold of the pipe

Better loosen it at the stove hole first advised Keziah What was it
you wanted to see me about Bish

Oh nothin nothin was the hasty response Nothin of any
accountthat is to say

He turned redder than ever and wrenched at the pipe It loosened at its
lower end and the wires holding it in suspension shook

I guess observed the lady of the house that youd better move that
chest of drawers out sos you can get behind it Grace you help me
There thats better Now move your chair

Kyan stepped from the chair and moved the latter to a position between
the highboy and the wall Then he remounted and gripped the pipe in the
middle of its horizontal section

Seems to stick in the chimney there dont it queried Keziah Wiggle
it back and forth that ought to loosen it What was it you wanted to
say Bish

Apparently Mr Pepper had nothing to say The crimson tide had reached
his ears which always noticeable because of their size and spread
were now lit up like a schooners sails at sunset His hands trembled on
the pipe

Nothin nothin I tell you he faltered II just run in to say
how dye do thats all

Really I think Id better be going said Grace glancing from Kyans
embarrassed face to that of the unsuspecting Mrs Coffin Im afraid
Im in the way

No no shouted the occupant of the chair No no you aint

But Im afraid I am And theyll be expecting me at home Aunt Keziah
I

Dont be in such a hurry interrupted Keziah Does stick in the
chimney dont it Tell you what you can do Grace you can go in the
woodshed and fetch the hammer thats in the table drawer Hurry up
thats a good girl

Kyan protested that he did not need the hammer but his protest was
unheeded With one more glance at the couple Grace departed from the
kitchen biting her lips She shut the door carefully behind her Mr
Pepper labored frantically with the pipe

No use to shake it any more till you get the hammer advised Keziah
Mights well talk while youre waitin What was it you wanted to tell
me

Abishai drew one hand across his forehead leaving a decorative smooch
of blacking on his perspiring countenance He choked swallowed and
then with a look at the closed door seemed to reach a desperate
resolve

Keziah he whispered hurriedly youve known me quite a spell aint
you

Known you Known you ever since you were born pretty nigh What of
it

Yes yes And Ive known you you know Fact is weve known each
other

Hear the man Land sakes dont everybody in Trumet know everybody
else What ARE you drivin at

Keziah youre a single woman

His companion let go of the chair which she had been holding in place
and stepped back

Im a single woman she repeated sharply What do you mean by that
Diddid anybody say I wasnt

No no Course not But youre a widow so you BE single you know
and

Well Did you think I was twins Get down off there this minute Youve
gone crazy I thought so when I saw that beaver Either that or youve
been drinkin Grace What DOES make her so long gettin that hammer

Finding the hammer did seem to take a long time There was no sound from
the kitchen Kyan steadying himself with one hand on the pipe waved
the other wildly

Sssh sshh he hissed Hush be still Dont get her in here
Keziah youre single and so am I You aint got nobody to take care of
you and I aint neitherthat is I dont want to be took care ofI
mean Ive been took care of too much

Mrs Coffin took another step in the direction of the kitchen

He IS loony she exclaimed under her breath I

No no I aint loony I want to make a proposal to you I want to see
if you wont marry me Im sick of Laviny Lets you and me settle down
together I could have some peace then And I think a whole lot of you
too he added apparently as an afterthought

Keziahs face was red now and growing redder every instant

Kyan Pepper she cried in amazed incredulity Kyan Pepper do you

Hurry up pleaded Abishai in agitated impatience Say yes quick
Shell be back in a minute

Say YES Why you

Dont stop to argue Keziah Ive got most fifteen hundred dollars in
the bank Laviny keeps the pass book in her bureau but you could get it
from her I own my house Im a man of good character Youre poor
but I dont let that stand in the way Anyhow youre a firstrate
housekeeper And I really do think an awful lot of you

Mrs Coffin stepped no farther in the direction of the kitchen Instead
she strode toward the rickety chair and its occupant Kyan grasped the
pipe with both hands

You poormiserableimpudent began the lady

Why Keziah dont you WANT to He spoke as if the possibility of
a refusal had never entered his mind I callated youd be glad
You wouldnt have to go away then norMy soul and body some ones
knockin at the door AND THIS DUMMED PIPES FETCHED LOOSE

The last sentence was a smothered shriek Keziah heeded not Neither
did she heed the knock at the door Her hands were opening and closing
convulsively

Be glad she repeated Glad to marry a goodfornothin sandpeep
like you You sassyGET down off that chair and out of this house Get
down this minute

I cant This stovepipes loose I tell you Be reasonble Keziah
Dodont you touch me Ill fall if you do Please KeziahO Lordy
I knew it LAVINY

The door opened On the threshold arms akimbo and lips set tight stood
Lavinia Pepper Her brothers knees gave way in their collapse they
struck the chair back the rickety leg wabbled Kyan grasped at the pipe
to save himself and the next moment chair sections of stovepipe and
Mr Pepper disappeared with a mighty crash behind the highboy A cloud
of soot arose and obscured the view

Keziah too indignant even to laugh glared at the wreck In the doorway
of the kitchen Grace Van Horne hammer in hand leaned against the jamb
her handkerchief at her mouth and tears in her eyes Lavinia majestic
and rigid dominated the scene From behind the highboy came coughs
sneezes and emphatic ejaculations

Miss Pepper was the first to speak

Abishai Pepper she commanded come out of that this minute

Her answer was a tremendous sneeze Then from the dusky cloud by the
wall sounded a voice feebly protesting

Now Laviny began poor Kyan I never in my life

Do you hear me Come out of that

There was a sound of scrambling More soot floated in the air Then
around the corner of the highboy appeared Mr Pepper crawling on his
hands and knees His hair was streaked with black his shirt front and
collar and shirt sleeves were spotted and smeared with black and from
his blackened cheeks his red whiskers flamed like the last glowing
embers in a firescarred ruin

Laviny he panted I never was so surprised and upsot in all my life
afore

This was too much for Grace She collapsed in a chair and laughed
hysterically Even the wrathful Keziah smiled But Lavinia did not
smile For that matter neither did her brother

Hum sneered Miss Pepper Upsot Yes I see youre upsot Get up and
try to look as much like a Christian as you can

Kyan rose from his knees to his feet and rubbed his back He glanced
reproachfully at Grace then fearfully at his sister

I was just tryin to help Keziah take down her stovepipe he
explained You see she didnt have no man to

Yes I see Well I judge you got it down Now you go out to the sink
and wash your face Heavens and earth Look at them clothes

I do hope you didnt hurt yourself Abishai said the sympathetic
Keziah Then as remembrance of what had led to the upset came to her
she added Though I will say twas your own fault and nobody elses

Lavinia whirled on her

His own fault was it she repeated her voice shrill and trembling
Thank you very much marm I callate twas his own fault comin
here too want it Nobody led him on I spose Nobody put him up to
riggin out in his best bib and tucker and sneakin here the minute I
was out of the house No nobody did Of COURSE not

No nobody did said Keziah briskly And you may know what youre
hintin at but I dont

Dear me Aint we innocent Weve got plenty of money WE have
Widowers with property aint no attraction to US Everybody knows
thatoh yes And they never talk of such a thingoh no Folks dont
say thatthatWell with a snarl in the direction of the kitchen
are you anywheres nigh clean yet Get your coat and hat on and come
home with me

She jerked her brother into the blue coat jammed the tall hat down upon
his head and seizing him by the arm stalked to the door

Good day marm she said I do hope the next widower you get to take
down your stovepipeyes indeed ha haI hope youll have better
luck with him Though I dont know who twould be there aint no more
idiots in town that I know of Good day and thank you kindly for your
attentions to our family

She pulled the door open and was on the step but Mrs Coffin did not
intend to let her go in just that way

Laviny Pepper she declared her eyes snapping I dont know what
youre talkin about but if you dare to mean that I want any of your
money or your brothers money youre mistakencause I dont And I
dont want your brother eitherLord help him poor thing And I tell
you right now that theres nobody that does though some kindhearted
folks have said twould be a Christian act to poison him sos to put
him out of his misery There Good mornin to you

She slammed the door Lavinia was speechless As for her brother but
one remark of his reached Grace who was watching from the window

Laviny pleaded Kyan just let me explain

At nine oclock that night he was still explaining

Keziah turned from the door she had closed behind her visitor

Well she ejaculated WELL

Her friend did not look at her She was still gazing out of the window
Occasionally she seemed to choke

Keziah eyed her suspiciously

Humph she mused Twas funny wasnt it

Oh dreadfully was the hurried answer

Yes Seems to me you took an awful long time findin that hammer

It was away back in the drawer I didnt see it at first

Hum Grace Van Horne if I thought you heard what thatthat THING said
to me IdIdGood land of mercy somebody ELSE is comin

Steps measured dignified steps sounded on the walk From without came
a Humha a portentous combination of cough and grunt Grace dodged
back from the window and hastily began donning her hat and jacket

Its Capn Elkanah she whispered I must go This seems to be your
busy morning Aunt Keziah Ihere she choked againreally I didnt
know you were so popular

Keziah opened the door Captain Elkanah Daniels prosperous pompous
and unbending crossed the threshold Richest man in the village
retired shipowner pillar of the Regular church and leading member of
its parish committee Captain Elkanah looked the part He removed
his hat cleared his throat behind his black stock and spoke with
impressive deliberation

Good morning Keziah Ahermorning Grace Even in the tone given
to a perfunctory salutation like this the captain differentiated
between Regular and ComeOuter Keziah Ihum harather expected to
find you alone

I was just going Capn Daniels explained the girl The captain bowed
and continued

Keziah he said Keziah I came to see you on a somewhat important
matter I have a proposal I wish to make you

He must have been surprised at the effect of his words Keziahs face
was a picture a crimson picture of paralyzed amazement As for Miss Van
Horne that young lady gave vent to what her friend described afterwards
as a squeal and bolted out of the door and into the grateful
seclusion of the fog


CHAPTER II

IN WHICH KEZIAH UNEARTHS A PROWLER


The fog was cruel to the gossips of Trumet that day Mrs Didama Rogers
who lived all alone except for the society of three cats a canary
and a white poodle named Bunch in the little house next to Captain
Elkanahs establishment never entirely recovered from the chagrin
and disappointment caused by that provoking mist When one habitually
hurries through the mornings household duties in order to sit by the
front window and note each passerby with various fascinating surmises
as to his or her errand and the reasons for it it is discouraging to be
able to see only ones own front fence and a scant ten feet of sidewalk
And then to learn afterwards of a dozen most exciting events each
distinctly out of the ordinary which might have been used as excuses
for two dozen calls and as many sensations As Captain Zeb Mayo the
irreverent exwhaler put it That fog shook Didamas faith in the
judgment of Providence Taint the all wise but the all seein
kind she talks about in meetin now

The fog prevented Mrs Rogerss noting the entrance of Mr Pepper at the
Coffin front gate Also his exit under sisterly arrest It shut from
her view the majestic approach of Captain Elkanah Daniels and Graces
flight her face dimpled with smiles and breaking into laughter
at frequent intervals For a young lady supposed to be a devout
ComeOuter to hurry along the main road a handkerchief at her mouth
and her eyes sparkling with fun was a circumstance calculated to
furnish material for enjoyable scandal And Didama missed it

Other happenings she missed also Not knowing of Captain Danielss call
upon Keziah she was deprived of the pleasure of wonder at the length of
his stay She did not see him in company with Mrs Coffin go down
the road in the opposite direction from that taken by Grace Nor their
return and parting at the gate two hours later She did not seebut
there she saw nothing absolutely nothingexcept the scraggy spruce
tree in her tiny front yard and the lonely ten feet of walk bordering
it No one traversed that section of walk except old Mrs Tinker who
was collecting subscriptions for new hymn books for the ComeOuter
chapel And Didama was particularly anxious NOT to see her

The dismal day dragged on The silverleaf trees dripped the hedges
were shining with moisture Through the stillness the distant surf along
the ocean side of the Cape growled and moaned and the fog bell at the
lighthouse clanged miserably Along the walk opposite Didamasthe
more popular side of the roadshadowy figures passed at long intervals
children going to and from school people on errands to the store and
the like It was three oclock in the afternoon before a visitor came
again to the Coffin front gate entered the yard and rapped at the side
door

Keziah opened the door

Halloa she exclaimed Back are you I begun to think youd been
scared away for good

Grace laughed as she entered

Well auntie she said I dont wonder you thought I was scared
Truly I didnt think it was proper for me to stay First Kyan and then
Capn Elkanah and both of them expressing their wishes to see you alone
soerpointedly I thought it was time for me to go Surely you give
me credit for a little delicacy

Keziah eyed her grimly

Humph she sniffed If youd been a little less delicate about
fetchin that hammer we might have been spared at least one smashup I
dont spose Lavinyll ever speak to me again Oh dear I guess likely
Ill never get the memory of thatthat Kyan thing out of my mind I
never was so set back in my born days Yes you can laugh

She laughed herself as she said it As for Grace it was sometime before
that young lady became coherent

He DID look so funny she gasped Hopping up and down on that shaky
chair and holding on to that pipe andandO Aunt Keziah if you could
have seen your face when I opened that door

Yes well I will say you was sometime gettin it open And then on
top of the whole fool business in parades Elkanah Daniels and

She paused Her companion looked delightedly expectant

Yes she cried eagerly Then Capn Elkanah came and the very first
thing he said wasI almost laughed in his face

Almost Humph thats no exaggeration The way you put out of that door
was a caution

Yes but what did the capn mean Is it a secret Ahem shall I
congratulate you auntie

Grace Van Horne theres born fools enough in this town without your
tryin to be one You know twant THAT Though what twas was surprise
enough I will say she added Grace I aint goin away tomorrow

Youre not Oh splendid Has the capn decided to let you stay here

I guess his decidin wouldnt influence me if twas stayin in his
house he meant The only way I could live here would be on his charity
and that would be as poor fodder as sawdust hasty puddin even if I
was fond of charity which I aint He said to meWell you take your
things off and Ill tell you about it You can stay a little while
cant you

Yes I was going to stay all the afternoon and for supper if youd let
me I knew you had so much to do and I wanted to help I told uncle and
he said certainly I ought to come He said he should try to see you and
say goodby before you left tomorrow

You dont say And me a Regular Well Im much obliged though I guess
your Uncle Eben wont see me tomorrownor speak to me again when he
knows what I AM going to do Grace I aint goin to leave Trumet not
for the present anyhow Ive got a way of earnin my livin right here
Im goin to keep house for the new minister

The girl turned her hat in her hand

Oh she cried in utter astonishment

Keziah nodded Yes she affirmed That was what Elkanahs proposal
amounted to Ha ha Deary me When he said proposal I own up for
a minute I didnt know WHAT was comin After Kyan I was prepared
for most anything But he told me that Lurany Phelps who the parish
committee had counted on to keep house for Mr Ellery had sent word her
sister was sick and couldnt be left and that somebody must be hired
right off cause the ministers expected by day after tomorrows coach
And theyd gone over every likely candidate in town till it simmered
down to Mehitable Burgess And Capn Zeb Mayo spoke right up in the
committee meetin and gave out that if Mehitable kept house for Mr
Ellery he for one wouldnt come to church Said he didnt want to hear
sermons that was inspired by HER cookin Seems she cooked for the Mayos
one week when Mrs Mayo had gone to Boston and Capn Zeb declares his
dreams that week was somethin awful And Im a man with no nerves and
mighty little imagination he says Land knows what effect a dose of
Mehitables biscuits might have on a MINISTER

And so continued Keziah they decided Mehitable wouldnt do and
finally somebody thought of me I have a notion twas Zeb although
Capn Elkanah did his best to make me think twas himself And the capn
was made a delegate to come and see me about it Come he did and we
settled it I went down to the parsonage with him before dinner and
looked the place over Theres an awful lot of sweepin and dustin to
be done afore its fit for a body to live in I did think that when Id
finished with this house I could swear off on that kind of dissipation
for a while but I guess judgin by the looks of that parsonage what
Ive done so far is only practice She paused glanced keenly at her
friend and asked Why whats the matter You dont act nigh so glad as
I thought youd be

Grace said of course she was glad but she looked troubled
nevertheless

I can hardly make it seem possible she said Is it really
settledyour salary and everything And what will you do about your
position in Boston

Oh Ill write Cousin Abner and tell him Lord love you HE wont care
Hell feel that he did his duty in gettin me the Boston chance and if I
dont take it taint his fault HIS consciencell be clear Land sakes
if I could clean house as easy as some folks clear their consciences I
wouldnt have a backache this minute Yes the wages are agreed on too
And totin them around wont make my back ache any worse either she
added drily

Grace extended her hand

Well Aunt Keziah she said Im ever and ever so glad for you
I know you didnt want to leave Trumet and Im sure everyone will be
delighted when they learn that youre going to stay

Humph that includes Laviny Pepper of course I callate Lavinys
delight wont keep her up nights But I guess I can stand it if she can
Now Grace what is it You AINT real pleased Why not

The girl hesitated

Auntie she said Im selfish I guess Im glad for your sake you
mustnt think Im not But I almost wish you were going to do something
else You are going to live in the Regular parsonage and keep house
for of all persons a Regular minister Why so far as my seeing you is
concerned you might as well be in China You know Uncle Eben

Keziah nodded understandingly

Yes she said I know him Eben Hammond thinks that parsonage is
the presence chamber of the Evil One I presume likely But Grace you
mustnt blame me and if you dont call Ill know why and I shant blame
you Well see each other once in a while Ill take care of that And
deary I HAD to do itI just had to If you knew what a load had been
took off my mind by this youd sympathize with me and understand Ive
been happier in Trumet than I ever was anywhere else though Ive seen
some dark times here too I was born here my folks used to live here
My brother Sol lived and died here His death was a heavy trouble to
me but the heaviest came to me when I was somewheres else andwell
somehow Ive had a feelin that if there was any real joys ever planned
out for me while Im on this earth theyd come to me here I dont know
when theyll come Theres times when I cant believe they ever will
come butThere there everybody has to bear burdens in this life I
callate Its a vale of tears cordin to you ComeOuter folks though
Ive never seen much good in wearin a long face and a crape bathin
suit on that account Hey What are you listenin to

I thought I heard a carriage stop that was all

Mrs Coffin went to the window and peered into the fog

Cant see anything she said Taint anybody for here thats sure
I guess likely twas Capn Elkanah He and Annabel were goin to drive
over to Denboro this afternoon She had some trimmin to buy Takes more
than fog to separate Annabel Daniels from dressmakin Well theres a
little more packin to do then I thought Id go down to that parsonage
and take a whack at the cobwebs I never saw so many in my born days
Youd think all the spiders from here to Ostable had been holdin camp
meetin in that shutup house

The packing took about an hour When it was finished the carpet rolled
up and the last piece of linen placed in the old trunk Keziah turned
to her guest

Now Gracie she said I feel as though I ought to go to the
parsonage I cant do much moren look at the cobwebs tonight but
tomorrow those spiders had better put on their ascension robes The
end of the worlds comin for them even though it missed fire for the
Millerites when they had their doins a few years ago You can stay
here and wait if twont be too lonesome Well have supper when I get
back

Grace looked tempted

Ive a good mind to go with you she said I want to be with you as
much as I can and HE isnt there yet Im afraid uncle might not like
it but

Sho Come along Eben Hammond may be a chronic sufferer from acute
ComeOutiveness but he aint a ninny Nobodyll see you anyway This
fogs like charity itll cover a heap of sins Do come right along
Wait till I get on my things

She threw a shawl over her shoulders draped a white knitted cloud
over her head and took from a nail a key attached by a strong cord to
a block of wood eight inches long

Elkanah left the key with me she observed No danger of losin it
is there Might as well lose a lumber yard Old Parson Langley tied it
up this way so he wouldnt miss his moorins I presume likely The
poor old thing was so nearsighted and absentminded along toward the
last that they say he used to hire Noah Myricks boy to come in and look
him over every Sunday mornin before church sos to be sure he hadnt
got his wig on stern foremost Thats the way Zeb Mayo tells the yarn
anyhow

They left the house and came out into the wet mist Then turning to
the right in the direction which Trumet with unconscious irony calls
downtown they climbed the long slope where the main road mounts the
outlying ridge of Cannon Hill passed Captain Mayos big housethe
finest in Trumet with the exception of the Daniels mansionand
descended into the hollow beyond Here at the corner where the
Lighthouse Lane begins its winding way over the rolling knolls and
dunes to the light and the fish shanties on the ocean side stood
the plain straightupanddown meeting house of the Regular society
Directly opposite was the little parsonage also very straight up and
down Both were painted white with green blinds This statement is
superfluous to those who remember Cape architecture at this period
practically every building from Sandwich to Provincetown was white and
green

They entered the yard through the gap in the white fence and went
around the house past the dripping evergreens and the bare wet lilac
bushes to the side door the lock of which Keziahs key fitted There
was a lock on the front door of course but no one thought of meddling
with that That door had been opened but once during the late pastors
thirtyyear tenantry On the occasion of his funeral the mourners came
and went as was proper by that solemn portal

Mrs Coffin thrust the key into the keyhole of the side door and essayed
to turn it

Humph she muttered twisting to no purpose I dont see whyThis
must be the right key becauseWell I declare if it aint unlocked
already Thats some of Capn Elkanahs doins For a critter as fussy
and particular about some things hes careless enough about others
Mercy we aint had any tramps around here lately Come in

She led the way into the dining room of the parsonage Two of the blinds
shading the windows of that apartment had been opened when she and
Captain Daniels made their visit and the dim gray light made the room
more lonesome and forsaken in appearance than a deeper gloom could
possibly have done The black walnut extension table in the center
closed to its smallest dimensions because Parson Langley had eaten alone
for so many years the black walnut chairs set back against the wall at
regular intervals the rag carpet and braided matshomemade donations
from the ladies of the parishon the green painted floor the dolorous
pictures on the walls Death of Washington Stoning of Stephen and
a still more deadly fruit piece committed in oils years ago by a now
deceased boat painter a black walnut sideboard with some blueandwhite
crockery upon it a giltframed mirror with another outrage in oils
emphasizing its upper half dust over everything and the cobwebs
mentioned by Keziah draping the corners of the ceiling this was the
dining room of the Regular parsonage as Grace saw it upon this her
first visit The dust and cobwebs were in her eyes the only novelties
however Otherwise the room was like many others in Trumet and if
there had been one or two paintings of ships would have been typical of
the better class

Phew exclaimed Keziah sniffing disgustedly Musty and shut up
enough aint it Down here in the dampness and specially in the
spring it dont take any time for a house to get musty if it aint
aired out regular Mr Langley died only three months ago but weve
been candidatin ever since and the candidates have been boarded round
Theres been enough of em too were awful hard to suit I guess
Thats it Do open some more blinds and a window Fresh air dont hurt
anybodyunless its spiders with a glare at the loathed cobwebs

The blinds and a window being opened more light entered the room Grace
glanced about it curiously

So this is going to be your new home now Aunt Keziah she observed
How queer that seems

Umhm Does seem queer dont it Must seem queer to you to be so
near the headquarters of everything your uncle thinks is wicked Smell
of brimstone any does it she asked with a smile

No I havent noticed it Youve got a lot of cleaning to do I wish I
could help Look at the mud on the floor

Keziah looked

Mud she exclaimed Why so tis How in the world did that come
here Wet feet sures youre born Mans foot too Capn Elkanahs
I guess likely though the prints dont look hardly big enough for his
Elkanahs convinced that hes a great man and his boots bear him out
in it dont they Those marks dont look broad enough for his
understandin but I guess he made em nobody else could Heres the
settin room

She threw open another door A room gloomy with black walnut and
fragrant with camphor was dimly visible

Cheerfuls a tomb aint it was Mrs Coffins comment Well well
get some light and air in here pretty soon Heres the front hall and
theres the front stairs The parlors off to the left We wont bother
with that yet a while This little place in here is what Mr Langley
used to call his study Halloa how this door sticks

The door did stick and no amount of tugging could get it open though
Grace added her efforts to those of Keziah

Taint locked commented Mrs Coffin cause there aint any lock on
it I guess its just swelled and stuck from the damp Though its odd
I dont rememberOh well never mind Lets sweeten up this settin
room a little Open a window or two in here Well have to hurry if we
want to do anything before it gets dark Im goin into the kitchen to
get a broom

She hurried out returning in a moment or two with a broom and a most
disgusted expression

Hows a body goin to sweep with that she demanded exhibiting the
frayed utensil the business end of which was worn to a stub More
like a shovel enough sight Well theres pretty nigh dust enough for
a shovel so maybe thisll take off the top layers Spose Ill ever get
this house fit for Mr Ellery to live in before he comes I wonder if
hes a particular man

Grace who was struggling with a refractory window paused for breath

Im sure I dont know she replied Ive never seen him

Nor I either Sol was so bad the Sunday he preached that I couldnt go
to meetin They say his sermon was fine all about those who go down to
the sea in ships Thats what got the parish committee I guess theyre
all old salts I wonder if hes as finelookin as they say

Miss Van Horne tossed her head She was resting prior to making another
assault on the window

I dont know she said And Im sure I dont care I dont like
goodlooking ministers

Deary me Youre different from most females in this town then And
you spoke of his good looks yourself this very mornin Why dont you
like the goodlookin ones

Oh because theyre always conceited and patronizing and superiorand
spoiled I can just imagine this Mr Ellery of yours strutting about in
sewing circle or sociables with Annabel and Georgianna Lothrop and the
rest simpering and gushing and getting in his way O Mr Ellery I did
so enjoy that sermon of yours Sunday and O Mr Ellery it was SO good
of you to come this afternoon Pooh Im glad Im a ComeOuter Not
that I would simper over him if I wasnt He couldnt patronize menot
more than once at any rate

Keziah was greatly amused

Sakes alive she chuckled Youre awfully high and mighty seems to
me And changeable since mornin You was willin enough to talk about
him then Now Gracie you mustnt take a spite against poor Mr Ellery
just because Ive got to keep house for him Taint his fault he dont
even know it yet

I dont care I know hell be a conceited little snippet and I shall
hate the sight of him There there Auntie you mustnt mind me I
told you I was a selfish pig But dont you ask me to LIKE this precious
minister of yours because I shant do it He has no business to come
and separate me from the best friend Ive got Id tell him so if he was
hereWhat was that

Both women looked at each other with startled faces They listened
intently

Why want that funny whispered Keziah I thought I heard

You DID hear So did I What do you suppose

Ssshh It sounded from the front room somewhere And yet there
cant be anybody in there becauseMy soul there tis again Im goin
to find out

She grasped the stubby broom by the handle and moved determinedly toward
the front hall Grace seized her by the arm

Dont you do it auntie she whispered frantically Dont you DO it
It may be a tramp

I dont care Whoever or whatever it is it has no business in this
house and Ill make that plain in a hurry Just like as not its a cat
got in when Elkanah was here this forenoon Dont be scared Grace Come
right along

The girl came along but not with enthusiasm They tiptoed through the
dark narrow hall and peered into the parlor This apartment was dim and
still and gloomy as all proper parlors should be but there was no sign
of life

Humph sniffed Keziah It might have been upstairs but it didnt
sound so What did it sound like to you

Like a footstep at first and then like something fallingand
rustling Oh what is the matter

Mrs Coffin was glancing back down the hall with a strange expression on
her face Her grip upon the broom handle tightened

What IS it pleaded the girl in an agonized whisper

Grace was the low reply Ive just remembered somethin That study
door isnt stuck from the damp becausewell because I remember now
that it was open this mornin

Before her companion could fully grasp the import of this paralyzing
fact Keziah strode down the hall and seized the knob of the study door

Whoever you are in there she commanded sternly open this door and
come out this minute Do you hear Im orderin you to come out

There was an instant of silence then a voice from within made answer a
mans voice and its tone indicated embarrassment

Madam it said II amI will be out in another minute If you will
just be patient

Grace interrupted with a smothered shriek Keziah brandished the broom

Patient she repeated sharply Well I like that What do you mean
byOpen that door Grace run out and get thethe constable

This command was delivered entirely for effect The office of constable
in Trumet is generally speaking a purely honorary one Its occupant
had just departed for a weeks cruise as mate of a mackerel schooner
However the effect was instantaneous From behind the door came sounds
of hurry and commotion

Dont get the police on my account please said the voice If you
will be patient until I get thisIm just as anxious to come out as you
can be to have me Of all the ridiculous

Come out then snapped Keziah Come out If youre so everlastin
anxious then come out Patience Of all the cheek Why dont you come
out NOW

The answer was brisk and to the point Evidently the unknowns stock of
the virtue which he demanded of others was diminishing

Well to be frank since you insist snapped the voice Im not fully
dressed

This was a staggerer For once Keziah did not have a reply ready
She looked at Grace and the latter at her Then without words they
retreated to the sitting room

Shallshall I go for help whispered the girl Hadnt we better
leave him here andHe doesnt sound like a tramp does he What DO you
suppose

I hope you wont be alarmed continued the voice broken by panting
pauses as if the speaker was struggling into a garment I know this
must seem strange You see I came on the coach as far as Bayport
and then we lost a wheel in a rut There was aoh dear where IS
thatthis is supremely idioticI was saying there happened to be a
man coming this way with a buggy and he offered to help me along He was
on his way to Wellmouth So I left my trunk to come later and took my
valise It rained on the way and I was wet through I stopped at Captain
Danielss house and the girl said he had gone with his daughter to the
next town but that they were to stop here at the parsonage on their
way Sothere thats right at lastso I came hoping to find them
The door was open and I came in The captain and his daughter were not
here but as I was pretty wet I thought I would seize the opportunity
to change my clothes I had some dryerthings in my valise and
Iwell then you came you see andI assure you Iwell it was the
most embarrassingIm coming now

The door opened The two in the sitting room huddled close together
Keziah holding the broom like a battleax ready for whatsoever might
develop From the dimness of the tightly shuttered study stepped the
owner of the voice a stranger a young man his hair rumpled his
tie disarranged and the buttons of his waistcoat filling the wrong
buttonholes Despite this evidence of a hasty toilet in semidarkness he
was not unprepossessing Incidentally he was blushing furiously

ImIm sure I beg your pardon ladies he stammered I scarcely
know what to say to you I

His eyes becoming accustomed to the light in the sitting room he was
now able to see his captors more clearly He looked at Keziah then at
Miss Van Horne and another wave of blushes passed from his collar up
into the roots of his hair Grace blushed too though as she perfectly
well knew there was no reason why she should

Mrs Coffin did not blush This young fellow although evidently not a
tramp or a burglar had caused her some moments of distinct uneasiness
and she resented the fact

Well she observed rather tartly Im sorry you dont know what to
say but perhaps you might begin by telling us who you are and what you
mean by makin aerdressin room of a house that dont belong to
you just because you happened to find the door unlocked After that
you might explain why you didnt speak up when we first come instead
of keepin so mighty quiet That looks kind of suspicious to me I must
say

The strangers answer was prompt enough now It was evident he resented
the suspicion

I didnt speak he said because you took me by surprise and I
wasnt as I explainederpresentable Besides I was afraid of
frightening you I assure you I hurried as fast as I could quietly and
when you began to talkhis expression changed and there was a twitch
at the corner of his mouthI tried to hurry still faster hoping you
might not hear me and I could make my appearanceor my escapesooner
As for entering the housewell I considered it in a way my house at
least I knew I should live in it for a time and

Live in it repeated Keziah LIVE in it Why mercy on us you dont
mean to say youre

She stopped to look at Grace That young lady was looking at her with
an expression which as it expressed so very much is beyond ordinary
powers of description

My name is Ellery said the stranger I am the ministerthe new
minister of the Regular society

Then even Keziah blushed


CHAPTER III

IN WHICH KEZIAH ASSUMES A GUARDIANSHIP


Didama would have given her eyeteethand for that matter the entire
upper setto have been present in that parsonage sitting room when the
Rev John Ellery made his appearance But the fates were against Didama
that day and it was months afterwards before she or any of what
Captain Zeb Mayo called the Trumet Daily Advertisers picked up a hint
concerning it Keziah and Grace acquainted with the possibilities of
these volunteer news gatherers were silent and the Reverend John
being in some respects a discreet young man with a brandnew ministerial
dignity to sustain refrained from boasting of the sensation he had
caused He thought of it very often usually at most inconvenient times
and when by all the requirements of his high calling his thought
should have been busy with different and much less worldly matters

I declare said Mrs Thankful Payne after the new ministers first
call at her residence a week after his arrival at Trumet if Mr
Ellery aint the most sympathetic man I was readin out loud to him
the poem my cousin Huldy Bher that married Hannibal Ellis over to
Denboromade up when my second husband was lost to sea and Id just
got to the pint in the ninth verse where it says

 The cruel billows crash and roar
 And the frail craft is tempesttossed
 But the bold mariner thinks not of life but says
 It is the fust schooner ever I lost

And twas too and the last poor thing Well I just got fur as this
when I looked up and there was the minister lookin out of the window
and his face was just as red and he kept scowlin and bitin his
lips I do believe he was all but sheddin tears Sympathy like that I
appreciate

As a matter of fact Mr Ellery had just seen Grace Van Horne pass that
window She had not seen him but for the moment he was back in that
disgusting study making a frenzied toilet in the dusk and obliged to
overhear remarks pointedly personal to himself

Grace left the parsonage soon after the supposed tramp disclosed
his identity Her farewells were hurried and she firmly refused Mrs
Coffins not tooinsistent appeal to return to the house up street
and have supper She said she was glad to meet Mr Ellery The young
minister affirmed his delight in meeting her Then she disappeared in
the misty twilight and John Ellery surreptitiously wiped his perspiring
forehead with his cuff having in his late desire for the primal
necessities forgotten such a trifling incidental as a handkerchief

Well Mr Ellery observed Keziah turning to her guest or employer
or incumbranceat present she was more inclined to consider him the
latterwell Mr Ellery this has been kind of unexpected for all
hands aint it If Id known you was comin today Id have done my
best to have things ready but Capn Elkanah said not before day after
tomorrow andbut there whats the use of talkin that way I didnt
know I was goin to keep house for you till this very forenoon Mercy
me what a day this has been

The minister smiled rather onesidedly

Its been something of a day for me he admitted I am ahead of time
and Ive made a lot of trouble Im afraid But yesterday afternoon I
was ready and to tell the truth I was eager to come and see my new
home and get at my work So I started on the morning train Then the
stage broke down and I began to think I was stranded at Bayport
But this kindhearted chap from WellmouthI believe thats where he
livedhappened to pull up to watch us wrestling with the smashed wheel
and when he found I was in a hurry to get to Trumet offered to give me
a lift His name waswas Bird No that wasnt it but it was something
like Bird or some kind of a bird

Bird repeated Keziah thoughtfully Theres no Birds that I know of
in Wellmouth Hum Hey Twant Sparrow was it

That was itSparrow

Good land Emulous Sparrow Run considerble to whiskers and tongue
didnt he

Why yes he did wear a beard As for tonguewell he was
conversational if thats what you mean

Thats what I mean If you rode twelve mile with Emulous you must have
had an earache for the last six Did he ask a question or two about your
personal affairs here and there between times

Mr Ellery laughed

Yes one or two between times he admitted

I shant die of surprise Did you tell him who you was

Noo to be honest I didnt He was so very anxious to find out
thatwell I dodged I think he believed I was going to visit Captain
Daniels

Good enough If I was governor of this state I wouldnt send any
Thanksgivin proclamations down this way Id just write Em Peters and
Didama Rogers and a couple more like them and save myself the trouble
Theyd have all I wanted to proclaim spread from one end of the county
to the other in lessn a day and a peck or two of extrys pitched in
for good measure Im awful glad you didnt tell Emulous you was the
minister You see Trumets Trumet and considerin everything maybe
its just as well nobody knows about your bein shut up in that study
Not but what twas all right you know but

I understand Im not proud of it Still some one may have seen me
come here

No no they didnt This fog is as thick as Injunmeal puddin Nobody
saw you

Well with some hesitation the young lady who was here with you

Oh Grace Van Horne Shes all right She wont tell She aint that
kind

Van Horne That doesnt sound like a New England name

Tisnt Her folks come from Jersey somewheres But she was adopted
by old Capn Hammond who keeps the tavern down on the bay shore by the
packet wharf and shes lived in Trumet since she was six years old Her
father was Teunis Van Horne and he was mate on Capn Ebens coastin
schooner and was drowned off Hatteras Eben was saved just by the skin
of his teeth and got a broken hip and religion while it happened His
hips better except that hes some lame but his religions been more
and more feverish ever since Hes one of the head ComeOuters and
built their chapel with his own money You mustnt think Im speakin
lightly of religion nor of Capn Eben either Hes a dear good soul as
ever was but he is the narrowest kind of ComeOuter His creed is
just about as wide as the chapel door and thats as narrow as the way
leadin to salvation it IS the way too so the ComeOuters think

What are ComeOuters Some new sect

Sakes alive Havent you heard of ComeOuters Cats foot Well youll
hear of em often enough from now on Theyre folks who used to go to
our church the Regular but left because the services was too worldly
with organs and choir singin and the road to paradise too easy No
need for me to tell you any more Youll learn

Mr Ellery was interested He had been in Trumet but once before on the
occasion when he preached his trial sermon and of that memorable
visit remembered little except the sermon itself the pews filled
with captains and their families and the aweinspiring personality of
Captain Elkanah Daniels who had been his host To a young man the ink
upon his diploma from the theological school still fresh a trial sermon
is a weighty matter and the preaching of it weightier still He had
rehearsed it over and over in private had delivered it almost through
clinched teeth and had returned to his room in the Boston boarding
house with the conviction that it was an utter failure Captain Elkanah
and the gracious Miss Annabel his daughter had been kind enough to
express gratification and their praise alone saved him from despair
Then to his amazement the call had come Of casual conversation at the
church and about the Danielss table he could recall nothing So there
was another religious organization in town and that made up of seceders
from his own church He was surprised

Erthis Miss Van Horne he asked Is she aComeOuter

Mrs Coffin nodded

Yes she said Shes one Couldnt be anything else and live with her
Uncle Eben as she calls him

The minister experienced a curious feeling of disappointment and
chagrin This young person already predisposed to regard a clergyman of
his denomination with disapproval had seen him for the first time under
most humiliating circumstances And he should never have the opportunity
to regain her favor or his own selfrespect by his efforts in the
pulpit No matter how well he might preach she would never hear him

Has this Captain Hammond no children of his own he asked

Keziahs answer was short for her

Yes she said One

Ah another daughter

No a son Names Nathaniel and hes a sea captain Hes on his way
from Surinam to New York now They expect him to make port most any
time I believe Now Mr Ellery I spose weve got to arrange for your
supper and stayin overnight and with this house the way tis and all
I dont see

But the minister was still interested in the Hammond household

This Nathaniel Hammond he asked You dont seem enthusiastic over
him Is he a black sheep

This reply also was short but emphatic

No said Keziah Hes a fine man

Then she resumed her semisoliloquy concerning her companions
entertainment

I guess she said that the best thing for you to do will be to go to
Capn Elkanahs Theyll be real glad to see you I know and youll
be in time for supper for Elkanah and Annabel have been to Denboro and
theyll be late home They can keep you overnight too for its a big
house with lots of rooms Then after breakfast tomorrow you come right
here Ill have things somewhere near shipshape by then I guess though
the cleaninll have to be mainly a lick and a promise until I can really
get at it Your trunkll be here on the coach I spose and thatll be
through early in the forenoon Get on your hat and coat and Ill go with
you to Elkanahs

The young man demurred a little at thrusting himself upon the
hospitality of the Danielss home but Keziah assured him that his
unexpected coming would cause no trouble So he entered the now dark
study and came out wearing his coat and carrying his hat and valise in
his hand

Im sure Im ever so much obliged to you he said And as we are
going to be more or less togetheror at least I guess as much from what
you saywould you mind if I suggest a mutual introduction Im John
Ellery you know that already And you

Keziah stopped short on her way to the door

Well I declare she exclaimed If I aint the very worst Fact is
you dropped in so ahead of time and in such a irregular sort of way
that I never once thought of introducin anybody and Im sure Grace
didnt Im Keziah Coffin and Capn Elkanah and I signed articles so
to speak this mornin and Im goin to keep house for you

She explained the reason upsetting the former arrangement by which
Lurania Phelps was to have had the position

So Im to keep house for you she concluded Adding For a spell
anyhow

Why do you say that asked the minister

Well you might not like me You may be particular you know

I think I can run that risk

Yes well you cant tell Or I might not like you You see Im pretty
particular myself she added with a laugh

At the Danielss door Keziah turned her new charge over to Matilda Snow
the hired girl It was an indication of the familys social position
that they kept hired help This was unusual in Trumet in those days
even among the well to do

Good night said the young man extending his hand Good night
Missor is it MrsCoffin

Mrs Good night

Shes a widow explained Matilda Husband died fore she come back
here to live Guess he didnt amount to much she never mentions his
name

There was one thing I meant to tell her mused the minister
hesitating on the threshold I meant to tell her not to attempt any
cleaning up at the parsonage tonight Tomorrow will do just as well

Heavens to Betsy sniffed the hired help speaking from the depths
of personal conviction nobody but a born fool would clean house in the
night specially after the cleanin shes been doin at her own place
I guess you neednt worry

So Mr Ellery did not worry And yet until three oclock of the
following morning the dull light of a whaleoil lantern illuminated the
rooms of the parsonage as Keziah scrubbed and swept and washed giving
to the musty place the lick and promise she had prophesied If the
spiders had prepared those ascension robes they could have used them
that night

After breakfast the wagons belonging to the Wellmouth furniture dealer
drove in at the gate of the little house opposite Captain Elkanahs and
Keziah saw with a feeling of homesickness which she hid beneath smiles
and a rattle of conversation the worn household treasures which had
been hers and her brothers before her carried away out of her life
Then her trunks were loaded on the tailboards of the wagons to be left
at the parsonage and with a sigh and a quick brush of her hand across
her eyes she locked the door for the last time and walked briskly down
the road Soon afterwards John Ellery under the eminently respectable
escort of Captain Elkanah and Miss Annabel emerged from the Danielss
gate and followed her Mrs Didama Rogers thankful for a clear
atmosphere and an unobstructed view saw them pass and recognized the
stranger And within a quarter of an hour she arrayed in a hurried
calling costume was spreading the news along the main road The Trumet
Daily Advertiser had so to speak issued an extra

Thus the new minister came to Trumet and thus Keziah Coffin became his
housekeeper She entered upon her duties with the wholehearted energy
peculiar to her She was used to hard work and as she would have said
felt lonesome without it She cleaned that parsonage from top to bottom
Every blind was thrown open and the spring sunshine poured in upon the
braided mats and the rag carpets Dust flew in clouds for the first
day or two but it flew out of windows and doors and was not allowed to
settle within The old black walnut furniture glistened with oil The
mirrors and the crockery sparkled from baths of hot water and soap Even
St Stephen in the engravings on the diningroom wall was forced to a
martyrdom of the fullest publicity because the spots and smears on the
glass covering his sufferings were violently removed In the sleeping
rooms upstairs the feather beds were beaten and aired the sheets and
blankets and patchwork comforters exposed to the light and the window
curtains dragged down and left to flap on the clothesline The smell of
musty dampness disappeared from the dining room and the wholesome odors
of outdoors and of good things cooking took its place

Keziah in the midst of her labors found time to coach her employer
and companion in Trumet ways and particularly in the ways which Trumet
expected its clergymen to travel On the morning following his first
night in the parsonage he expressed himself as feeling the need of
exercise He thought he should take a walk

Well said his housekeeper from her station opposite him at the
breakfast table if I was you I wouldnt take too long a one Youd
better be back here by ten anyhow Where was you thinkin of goin

Mr Ellery had no particular destination in mind He would like to see
something of the village and perhaps if she could give him the names
of a few of his parishioners he might make a few calls Keziah shook
her head

Gracious goodness she exclaimed I wouldnt advise you to do that
You aint been here long enough to make forenoon calls If you should
catch some of the women in this town with aprons and calico on theyd
never forgive you in this world Wait till afternoon theyll be
expectin you then and theyll be rigged out in their best bibs and
tuckers Spose you found Annabel Daniels with her hair done up in
curl papers what do you think would happen Mornins are no time
for ministers calls Even old Mr Langley never made calls in the
forenoonand hed been here thirtyodd years

All right you know best Much obliged for the advice Then Ill simply
take my walk and leave the calls until later

Id be back by ten though Folksll begin callin on you by that
time

They will Doesnt the rule work both ways

Not with new ministers it dont Cats foot You dont spose Didama
Rogers and Laviny Pepper and their kindll wait any longern they can
help afore they come to see what you look like do you

Well they must have seen me when I preached here before I remember

Mercy on us that was in meetin Meetins diffrent All they could
say to you then was how much they liked your sermon They say that to
every minister that comes no matter how they may pick him to pieces
afterwards But here they can ask you questions about how you came to
come here and what you think of it fars youve got and what your views
are on certain points in the creed Likewise who your folks were and
whether they was well off and a few things like that Then theyll want
to see what kind of clothes you wear and

Whew Ellery whistled Youre unfolding a pleasant prospect for me I
must say Am I supposed to be catechized on all of my private affairs

Of course A minister hasnt got any private affairs hes a public
character There she laughed as she poured the coffee I mustnt
discourage you But dont you see that every mothers sonand for that
matter every daughter and childrens child unto the third and fourth
generationfeel that so long as they pay pew rent or put a cent in the
collection they own a share in you And we always keep a watch on our
investments down this way Thats the Yankee shrewdness you read so much
about I guess

The minister absently played with his spoon

Im afraid youre a cynic he said

No no I aint Though sometimes considerin everything I feel as
though I had excuse enough if I wanted to belong to that tribe But
youre young You mustnt mind my sayin that if you was old of
course I wouldnt talk about ages But you are young and this is your
first church So you must start right Im no cynic bless you Ive got
trust in human nature leftmost kinds of human nature If I hadnt Id
have more money I spose Perhaps youve noticed that those who trust a
good deal are usually poor Its all right Mr Ellery you go and take
your walk And Ill walk into that pantry closet Itll be a good deal
like walkin into the Slough of Despond but Christian came out on the
other side and I guess likely I will if the supply of soapsuds holds
out

When promptly at ten oclock the minister returned from his walk
he found Mrs Rogers waiting in the sitting room It is a prime
qualification of an alert reporter to be first on the scene of
sensation Didama was seldom beaten Mr Ellerys catechism began
Before it was over Keziah opened the door to admit Miss Pepper and
her brother Kyan was nervous and embarrassed in the housekeepers
presence Lavinia was a glacier moving majestically and freezing as it
moved Keziah however was not even touched by the frost she greeted
the pair cordially and begged them to take off their things

It was dinner time before the catechizers departed The catechized came
to the table with an impaired appetite He looked troubled

Dont let it worry you Mr Ellery observed Keziah calmly I think
I can satisfy you Honest and true I aint half as bad as you might
think

The minister looked more troubled than before also surprised

Why Mrs Coffin he cried Could you hear

No no I couldnt hear nothin in that closet except my own opinion
on dirt and dust But if I was as deaf as the man that set on the
powder keg and dropped his pipe ashes into it it wouldnt have made any
difference The man said after they picked him up that they neednt have
been so rough hed have moved without bein pushed if theyd have made
signs they wanted to use the keg And if I was out in the next lot Id
have known what you was listenin to in that sittin room They hinted
that they were real sorry for you but twasnt any of THEIR doins The
parish committee bein just men was apt to make mistakes in certain
matters Of course everything MIGHT be well enough and if you want
TOO particular about cookin and so on whyAnyhow you mustnt think
that THEY were criticisin Twas only that they took an interest
andThat was about it wasnt it

Mrs Coffin II hope you dont think I paid any attention to their
remarksof that kind I mean Honestly I did my best to stop them I
said

Man alive Im not worried Why should you be We were talkin about
trust just nowor I was Well you and Ill have to take each other on
trust for a while until we see whether were goin to suit If you see
anything that Im goin wrong in I wish youd tell me And Ill do the
same by you if thats agreeable Youll hear a lot of things said about
me but if theyre very bad I give you my word they aint true And to
be real frank Ill probably hear some about you which Ill take for
what theyre worth and considerin who said em Thats a good wholesome
agreement I think for both of us What do you think

John Ellery said with emphasis that he thought well of it He began to
realize that this woman with her blunt common sense was likely to be
a pilot worth having in the difficult waters which he must navigate as
skipper of the Regular church in Trumet Also he began to realize that
as such a skipper he was most inexperienced And Captain Daniels
had spoken highlycondescendingly but highlyof his housekeepers
qualifications and personality So the agreement was ratified with
relief on his part

The first Sunday came and with it the first sermon He read that sermon
to Keziah on Saturday evening and she approved of it as a whole though
she criticised some of its details

Dont be afraid to put in plenty of salt she said Where youve
got the Christian life and spirit written down as bein like a quiet
peaceful home free from all distrust and like that why dont you
change it to a good safe anchorage where the soul can ride forever
without fear of breakers or notheasters or the dangers besettin the
mariner on a lee shore Theyll understand that it gets right home to
em Theres scarcely a man or a woman in your congregation that aint
been out of sight of land for weeks on a stretch

The breakfast hour on Sunday would be at nine oclock instead of seven
as on week days she told him

Trumet lays to bed Sunday mornins she explained Its almost a part
of its religion as you might say and lived up to more conscientious
than some other parts Im afraid Six days shalt thou labor and wear
comfortble clothes and on the seventh you must be lazy and dress up
Likewise you must have baked beans Saturday for supper as were havin
em and more beans with fish balls next mornin That is if you want
to be orthodox

The service began at eleven oclock At half past ten the sexton
old Mr Jubal Knowles rang the first bell a clanging fiveminute
reminder Twenty minutes later he began on the second and final call
Mr Ellery was readyand nervousbefore the first bell had finished
ringing But Keziah entering the sitting room dressed in black alpaca
and carrying the hymn book with her name in gilt letters on the cover
forbade his leaving the parsonage thus early

I shall go pretty soon she said but you mustnt The minister aint
expected until the last bells most done Parson Langley used to wait
until the Winslows went in Gaius Winslow is a widower man who lives up
to the west end of the town and hes got nine children all boys Youll
know em because they always drive down to meetin in one carryall with
a white horse Gaius is as punctual as a boardinhouse dinner The
old parson used to wait until the last Winslow had toddled up the
meetinhouse steps and then hed come out of this side door with
his sermon in his hand Its a pretty good rule to remember and saves
watchin the clock Besides its what weve been used to and that goes
a good ways with some folks Goodby Mr Ellery Youll see me in the
third pew from the back on the right side wishin you luck just as
hard as I can

So as in couples or family groups afoot or in all sorts of vehicles
the members of Trumets Regular society came to the church to hear their
new minister that functionary peeped under the parlor window shade of
the parsonage and waited fidgetting and apprehensive for the
Winslows They arrived at last and were not hard to recognize for ten
individuals packed into one carriage are hard to overlook anywhere As
Gaius with the youngest in his arms passed in at the church door John
Ellery passed out of the parsonage gate The last bell clanged its final
stroke the vibrations ceased the rustle of skirts and the sounds of
decorous coughing subsided and were succeeded by the dry rattle of the
hymnbook pages the organ presented by Captain Elkanah and played by
his daughter uttered its preliminary groan the service began

Outside the spring breeze stirred the budding silverleafs the distant
breakers grumbled the crows in the pines near Captain Eben Hammonds
tavern cawed ribald answers to the screaming gulls perched along the top
of the breakwater And seated on one of the hard benches of the little
ComeOuter chapel Grace Van Horne heard her Uncle Eben who as
usual was conducting the meeting speak of them who in purple and
fine linen with organs and trumpets and vain shows are gathered
elsewhere in this community to hear a hired priest make a mock of the
gospel AMEN

But John Ellery the hired priest knew nothing of this He did know
however that he was the center of interest for his own congregation
the people among whom he had been called to labor Their praise or
criticism meant everything to him therefore he preached for dear life

And Keziah Coffin in the third pew from the back watched him intently
her mind working in sympathetic unison with his She was not one to
be greatly influenced by first impressions but she had been favorably
impressed by this young fellow and had already begun to feel that sense
of guardianship and personal responsibility which later on was to make
Captain Zebedee Mayo nickname the minister Keziahs Parson

The sermon was a success


CHAPTER IV

IN WHICH KEZIAHS PARSON DECIDES TO RUN IT BLINDFOLD


On Monday afternoon the minister made a few calls Keziah made out a
short list for him to follow a sort of chart of the main channel she
called it with the safe ports marked and the shoals and risky places
labeled dangerous

You see she said Trumet aint a course you can navigate with your
eyes shut We divide ourselves into about four setsaristocrats poor
relations town folks and scum The aristocrats are the big bugs like
Capn Elkanah and the other welloff sea captains afloat or ashore
They most all go to the Regular church and the parish committee is
steered by em The poor relations are mainly widows and such whose
husbands died or were lost at sea Most of them are Regulars The town
folks are those that stay ashore and keep store or run salt works or
somethin And the scum work around on odd jobs or go fishin So if
you really want to be safe you must call on the aristocrats first
after that on the poor relations and so on down You wont be bothered
with scum much theyre mainly ComeOuters

Ellery took the list from her hand and looked it over

Hum he said musingly Am I supposed to recognize theseerclass
distinctions

Yes That is not in meetin or sewin circle or anything like that or
not out and out and open anywhere But you want to cultivate a sort of
different handshake and howdydo for each set sos to speak Gush all
you want to over an aristocrat Be thankful for advice and always SO
glad to see em With the poor relations you can ease up on the gush and
maybe condescend some Town folks expect condescension and superiority
give it to em When it comes to scum whywell any short kind of a
bow and a Mornin ll do for them Course the Lord in His infinite
mercy made em same as He did potato bugs but its necessary to keep
both bugs and them down to their proper place

She delivered this in the intervals between trips to the kitchen with
the dinner dishes The minister listened with a troubled expression on
his face

Mrs Coffin he said I guess Im dull There was a Scotch professor
at college and the fellows used to say his bump of humor was a dent
Maybe mine isnt much better Are you joking

Keziah stacked the cups and saucers

I aint jokin she declared Ive been a poor relation in this
village for a good while and my brother was a shoemaker and on the upper
fringe of the townfolk class My humor bump would have to stick up like
Cannon Hill afore I could see any joke in that

But youre not seriously advising me to treat a rich man differently
from a poor one

Not openly differentno But if you want to steer a perfectly SAFE
course one thatll keep deep water under your keel the whole voyage
why theres your chart

Mr Ellery promptly tore the chart into small pieces

Im going out he said I shall be back by supper time

Mrs Coffin eyed him grimly

Goin to run it blindfold are you she asked

Yes I am

Her grimness disappeared and she smiled

Ill have your supper ready for you she said Bring back a good
appetite

The young man hesitated on the threshold

Mrs Coffin he demanded would YOU have called only on the
aristocrats at first

She shook her head smiling still

No she replied not me Ive always taken risks But I didnt
know but you might be a safe sailor It saves a lot of trouble in this
world

How about the next

Oh well perhaps even the scum may count for somethin over there
She turned to face him and her smile vanished Go on Mr Ellery she
said Go and call where you please Far be it from me that I should
tell you to do anything else I suppose likely you hope some day to be
a great preacher I hope you will But Id enough sight rather you was a
good man than the very greatest No reason why you cant be both There
was a preacher over in Galilee once so you told us yesterday who was
just good Twant till years afterwards that the crowd came to realize
that he was great too And if I recollect right he chummed in with
publicans and sinners Im glad you tore up that fool paper of mine I
hoped you might when I gave it to you Now you run along and Ill wash
dishes If cleanliness is next to godliness then a parson ought to eat
out of clean plates

As a matter of fact the ministers calls were in the nature of a
compromise although an unintentional one He dropped in on Zebedee
Mayo owner of the big house on the slope of the hill Captain Zeb took
him up into what he called his cupoler the observatory on the top of
the house and showed him Trumet spread out like a map The main road
was north and south winding and twisting its rutted sandy way Along
it were clustered the principal houses and shops shaded by silverleaf
poplars a few elms and some willows and spruces Each tree bent
slightly away from the northeast the direction from which blew the
heavy winter gales Beyond the main road were green slopes and pastures
with swamps in the hollows swamps which were to be cranberry bogs in
the days to come Then the lower road with more houses and farther
on the beach the flatspartially uncovered because it was high
tideand the bay

Behind the Mayo house was the crest of Cannon Hill more hills pastures
and swamps scattered houses and pine groves Then began the tumbled
humped waste of sand dunes and over their ragged fringes of beach plum
and bayberry bushes the deep blue of the wide Atlantic The lighthouse
was a white dot and the fish shanties a blotch of brown Along the inner
edge of the blue were scars of dancing white the flashing teeth of
hungry shoals which had torn to pieces and swallowed many a good ship
And far out dotted and sprinkled along the horizon were sails

See said Captain Zeb puffing still from the exertion of climbing
the ladder to the cupoler for he was distinctly fleshy See The
beacons up Packet come in this mornin There she is See her down
there by the breakwater

Sure enough the empty barrel painted red was hoisted to the top of
its pole on the crest of Cannon Hill And looking down at the bay and
following the direction of the stubby pointing finger Ellery saw a
little schooner with her sails lowered lying slightly on her side
in a shallow pool near a long ridge of piled stonesthe breakwater A
small wharf made out from the shore and black figures moved briskly upon
it Carts were alongside the schooner and there more dots were busy

Ebens pennants flyin said Captain Zeb He always sets colors
when the packets in Keeps packet tavern Eben does Thats it that
oldfashioned gambrelroofed house on the rise by the wharf Call it
Saints Rest they do now cause Ebens so mighty religious

The minister saw the long rambling house with one lonely twisted tree
in its yard a flag flying from a pole beside it So that was where
the Hammonds lived And where the girl lived who was certain he was a
conceited snippet Whatever he might be in reality he hoped it was not
that Snippet was not in his dictionary but he didnt like the sound
of it

Who owns the packet he asked to make conversation

Zach Foster Married Freewill Doanes daughter over to Harniss Shes
dead now

A good sailor is he

Captain Zeb spat in supreme disgust

Good farmer he snorted Zach took over the packet for a debt when
the chap that used to run her died His dad old man Foster raised
garden truck at the same time mine went to sea Both of us took after
our fathers I guess Anyhow my wife says that when I die twill be of
salt water on the brain and Im sure Zachs head is part cabbage Been
better for him if hed stuck to his garden However I spose he does
his best

They say angels can do no more

Umm Well Zachll be an angel pretty soon if he keeps on cruisin
with that old hooker as she is Bijah Perry hes mate and the only
good seaman aboard tells me that most of the riggins rotten and the
main topmast aint sound by a good deal The old mans put off havin
her overhauled for two reasons one that repairs cost money and tother
that puttin off is the main sheet of his gospel When theres no rain
the roof dont leak and longs it dont blow too hard most any kind of
gearll hold Thats philosophycabbage philosophy

Ellery decided that he should like Captain Zeb although it was evident
that the old whaler had decided opinions of his own which he did not
hesitate to express He judged that the Mayos were of the socalled
aristocracy but undoubtedly unique specimens He visited four more
households that afternoon The last call was at Mrs Thankful Paynes
and while there listening to the wonderful poem he saw Miss Van
Horne pass the window as has already been told He came home to a Cape
Cod supper of scalloped clams hot biscuits and baked Indian pudding
and Keziah greeted him with a cheery smile which made him feel that it
WAS home His summary disposal of the chart had evidently raised him
in his housekeepers estimation She did not ask a single question as to
where he had been

Next day he had a taste of Trumets real aristocracy the genuine
article Captain Elkanah Daniels and his daughter made their first
formal call The captain was majestic in high hat furcollared cape
tailed coat and carrying a goldheaded cane Miss Annabel wore her
newest gown and bonnet and rustled as she walked They entered the
sitting room and the lady glanced superciliously about the apartment

Humha barked Captain Elkanah Ahem Mr Ellery I trust youre
being made comfortable The parish committee arehumahanxious that
you should be Yes

The minister said that he was very comfortable indeed

It isnt what youve been used to we know observed Miss Annabel
Mr Langley our former pastor was a sweet old gentleman but he was
oldfashioned and his tastes were queer especially in art Have you
noticed that fruit piece in the dining room Isnt it too ridiculous

Ellery admitted that the fruit piece was rather funny but no doubt it
had been a gift and so

Yes indeed I guess it was a present fast enough Nobody would buy
such a thing It seems strange to pa and me that although so many of
our people have been abroad they have such strange ideas of art Do you
remember the beautiful marbles in the palaces at Florence Mr Ellery
Of course youve seen them

The minister was obliged to admit that he had never been abroad

Oh is that so Ive been so many times with pa that it seems almost
as if everybody was as familiar with Yurrup as I am You remember what I
said about the marbles pa

Her parent nodded

Humha Oh yes yes he said That was when I was in the
fruitcarrying trade and made a voyage to Valenchy

Valencia pa corrected Annabel And Valencia is in Spain

I know it But we went to Leghorn afterwards I sailed to Cronstadt for
some years regular Cronstadt is in Rooshy Mr Ellery

Russia pa snapped his daughter Then she changed the subject to
church and parish affairs They spoke of the sewing circle and the
reading society and the Fridayevening meetings

The ComeOuters are so vexed with us tittered Miss Annabel that
they wont even hold prayer meeting on the same night as ours They have
theirs on Thursday nights and its as good as a play to hear them shout
and sing and carry on Youll enjoy the ComeOuters Mr Ellery Theyre
a perfect delight

And as they rose to go Captain Elkanah asked

Is there anything youd like done about the parsonage Mr Ellery
If so it shall be done immejitly How are you satisfied with your
housekeeper

Very well indeed Captain Daniels was the prompt reply

Shes a character isnt she giggled Annabel She was born here
in Trumet but went away to New Bedford when she was young and grew up
there Her maiden name was Hall but while she was away she married a
man named Ansel Coffin They didnt live together very long and werent
happy I guess I dont know whose fault it was nobody knows much
of anything about it for thats the one thing she wont talk about
Anyhow the Coffin man was lost to sea and after a while she came back
to keep house for her brother Solomon Shes an awful odd stick but
shes a good cook I believe though Im afraid you wont get the meals
people such as ourselves whove been so much in the city are used to

Ellery thought of the meals at his city boarding house and shuddered He
was an orphan and had boarded for years Incidentally he had worked his
way through college Captain Elkanah cleared his throat

Keziah he commanded Humha Keziah come in here a minute

Keziah came in response to the call her sewing in her hand The
renovation of the parsonage had so far progressed that she could now
find time for a little sewing after the dinner dishes were done

Keziah said the captain pompously we expect you to look out for Mr
Ellery in every respect The parish committee expects thatyes

Ill try said Mrs Coffin shortly

Yes Well thats all You can go We must be going too Mr
Ellery Please consider our house at your disposal any time Be
neighborlyhumhabe neighborly

Yes purred Annabel DO come and see us often Congenial society is
very scarce in Trumet for me especially We can read together Are you
fond of Moore Mr Ellery I just dote on him

The last humha was partially drowned by the click of the gate
Keziah closed the diningroom door

Mrs Coffin said the minister I shant trouble the parish
committee Be sure of that Im perfectly satisfied

Keziah sat down in the rocker and her needle moved very briskly for a
moment Then she said without looking up

Thats good I own up I like to hear you say it And I am glad there
are some things I do like about this new place of mine Becausewell
because theres likely to be others that I shant like at all

On Friday evening the minister conducted his first prayer meeting
Before it and afterwards he heard a good deal concerning the
ComeOuters He learned that Captain Eben Hammond had preached against
him in the chapel on Sunday Most of his own parishioners seemed to
think it a good joke

Stir em up Mr Ellery counseled Lavinia Pepper Stir em up Dont
be afraid to answer em from the pulpit and set em where they belong
Ignorant bigoted things

Others gave similar counsel The result was that the young man became
still more interested in these people who seemed to hate him and all he
stood for so profoundly He wished he might hear their side of the case
and judge it for himself It may as well be acknowledged now that John
Ellery had a habit of wishing to judge for himself This is not always a
politic habit in a country minister

The sun of the following Thursday morning rose behind a curtain of fog
as dense as that of the day upon which Ellery arrived A flat calm in
the forenoon the wind changed about three oclock and beginning with
a sharp and sudden squall from the northwest blew hard and steady Yet
the fog still cloaked everything and refused to be blown away

Theres rain astern observed Captain Zeb with the air of authority
which belongs to seafaring men when speaking of the weather Well get
a hard driving rain afore mornin you see Then if she still holds
from the northwestard itll fair off fine

Goin out in this Mr Ellery exclaimed Keziah in amazement as the
minister put on his hat and coat about seven that evening Sakes alive
you wont be able to see the way to the gate Its as dark as a niggers
pocket and thicker than young ones in a poor mans family as my father
used to say Youll be wet through Where in the world are you bound for
THIS night

The minister equivocated He said he had been in the house all day and
felt like a walk

Well take an umbrella then was the housekeepers advice Youll
need it before you get back I callate

It was dark enough and thick enough in all conscience The main road
was a black wet void through which gleams from lighted windows were
but vague yellow blotches The umbrella was useful in the same way
that a blind mans cane is useful in feeling the way The two or
three stragglers who met the minister carried lanterns One of these
stragglers was Mr Pepper Kyan was astonished

Well I snum cried Kyan raising the lantern If taint Mr Ellery
Where you bound this kind of night

Before the minister could answer a stately figure appeared and joined
the pair Lavinia of course

Well Mr Ellery she said Aint you lost out in this fog Anybody
sick

No no one was sick

Thats a mercy Goin callin be you

No

Hum Queer weather for a walk I call it Wont be many out tonight
except ComeOuters goin to holler their lungs loose at prayer meetin
He he You aint turned ComeOuter have you Mr Ellery Youve headed
right for the chapel

Ellerys reply was hurried and a bit confused He said good night and
went on

Laviny whispered the shocked Kyan do you think that was
aerpolite thing to say to a parson That about his turnin
ComeOuter He didnt make much answer seemed to me You dont think he
was mad do ye

I dont care if he was snorted Miss Pepper He could tell a body
where he was goin then Nobody can snub me minister or not I think
hes kind of stuckup if you want to know and if he is hell get took
down in a hurry Come along dont stand there with your mouth open like
a flytrap Id like to know what he was up to Ive a precious good mind
to follow him would if twant so much trouble

She didnt Yet if she had she would have deemed the trouble worth
while For John Ellery stumbled on through the mist till he reached the
Corners where the store was located and the roads forked There he
turned to the right into the way called locally Hammonds Turnoff
A short distance down the Turnoff stood a small brownshingled
building its windows alight Opposite its door on the other side of
the road grew a spreading hornbeam tree surrounded by a cluster of
swamp blackberry bushes In the black shadow of the hornbeam Mr Ellery
stood still He was debating in his mind a question should he or should
he not enter that building

As he stood there groups of people emerged from the fog and darkness
and passed in at the door Some of them he had seen during his fortnight
in Trumet Others were strangers to him A lantern danced and wabbled up
the Turnoff from the direction of the bay shore and the packet wharf
It drew near and he saw that it was carried by an old man with long
white hair and chin beard who walked with a slight limp Beside him was
a thin woman wearing a black poke bonnet and a shawl In the rear of
the pair came another woman a young woman judging by the way she was
dressed and her lithe vigorous step The trio halted on the platform of
the building The old man blew out the lantern Then he threw the door
open and a stream of yellow light poured over the group

The young woman was Grace Van Horne The minister recognized her at
once Undoubtedly the old man with the limp was her guardian Captain
Eben Hammond who by common report had spoken of him Ellery as a
hired priest

The door closed A few moments thereafter the sound of a squeaky
melodeon came from within the building It wailed and quavered and
groaned Then with a suddenness that was startling came the first
verse of a hymn sung with tremendous enthusiasm

 Oh who shall answer when the Lord shall call
 His ransomed sinners home

The hallelujah chorus was still ringing when the watcher across the
street stepped out from the shadow of the hornbeam Without a pause he
strode over to the platform Another moment and the door had shut behind
him

The minister of the Trumet Regular church had entered the ComeOuter
chapel to attend a ComeOuter prayer meeting


CHAPTER V

IN WHICH THE PARSON CRUISES IN STRANGE WATERS


The ComeOuter chapel was as bare inside almost as it was without
Bare wooden walls a beamed ceiling a raised platform at one end with
a table and chairs and the melodeon upon it rows of wooden settees for
the congregationthat was all As the minister entered the worshipers
were standing up to sing Three or four sputtering oil lamps but dimly
illumined the place and made recognition uncertain

The second verse of the hymn was just beginning as Ellery came in Most
of the forty or more grown people in the chapel were too busy wrestling
with the tune to turn and look at him A child here and there in the
back row twisted a curious neck but twisted back again as parental
fingers tugged at its ear The minister tiptoed to a dark corner and
took his stand in front of a vacant settee

The man whom Ellery had decided must be Captain Eben Hammond was
standing on the low platform beside the table A quaint figure
patriarchal with its flowing white hair and beard puritanical with its
set smoothshaven lips and tufted brows Captain Eben held an open hymn
book back in one hand and beat time with the other He wore brassbowed
spectacles well down toward the tip of his nose Swinging a heavy
stubby finger and singing in a high quavering voice of no particular
register he led off the third verse

 Oh who shall weep when the roll is called
 And who shall shout for joy

The melodeon and the hymn book were in accord as to the tune but
Captain Eben and the various members of the congregation seemed to have
a desire to improvise They sang with spirit however and the rhythmic
pat of feet grew louder and louder Here and there men and women were
swaying and rocking their bodies in time to the music The chorus for
each verse was louder than the one preceding it

Another hymn was given out and sung And another and still another The
windows rattled The patting grew to a steady thump thump Momentary
pauses between lines were punctuated by hallelujahs and amens Standing
directly in front of the minister was a sixfoot rawboned individual
whose clothes smelled strongly of fish and whose hands each swung
at the end of an exposed five inches of hairy red wrist looked like
flippers At the end of the third hymn this personage sprang straight up
into the air cracked the heels of a pair of red cowhide boots together
and whooped Glory be Send the PAOWER in a voice like the screech
of a northeast gale Mr Ellery whom this gymnastic feat had taken by
surprise jumped in sympathy although not as high

The singing over the worshipers sat down Captain Eben took a
figured handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead The thin
nearsighted young woman who had been humped over the keyboard of the
melodeon straightened up The worshipers relaxed a little and began to
look about

Then the captain adjusted his spectacles and opened a Bible which he
took from the table beside him Clearing his throat he announced that
he would read from the Word tenth chapter of Jeremiah

Thus saith the Lord Learn not the way of the heathen and be not
dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them

For the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of
the forest the work of the hands of the workmen with the ax

He read in a measured singsong stopping occasionally to hold the book
in a better light and peering at the fine print through his spectacles
And as he read there was a sudden rustle on one of the back benches A
child had turned stared and pulled at its mothers sleeve The rustle
grew and spread

Captain Eben drawled on to the twentieth verse

My tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are
gone forth from me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my
tent any more and to set up my curtains

For the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the Lord
therefore they shall not prosper and

AMEN

The shout came from the second bench from the front where Ezekiel
Bassett clam digger and fervent religionist was always to be found on
meeting nights Ezekiel was the father of Susannah B Bassett Sukey
B for short who played the melodeon He had been by successive
seizures a Seventh Day Baptist a Second Adventist a Millerite a
Regular and was now the most energetic of ComeOuters Later he was to
become a Spiritualist and preside at tabletipping seances

Ezekiels amen was so sudden and emphatic that it startled the reader
into looking up Instead of the faces of his congregation he found
himself treated to a view of their back hair Nearly every head
was turned toward the rear corner of the room there was a buzz of
whispering and in front many men and women were standing up to look
Captain Eben was scandalized

Well he exclaimed Is this a prayer meetin ororwhat Brethren
and sisters I must say

Ezekiel Bassett stepped forward and whispered in his ear The
captains expression of righteous indignation changed to one of blank
astonishment He too gazed at the dark corner Then his lips tightened
and he rapped smartly on the table

Brethren and sisters he thundered in the voice which of old had
enforced obedience aboard his coasting schooner remember this is the
house of the Lord Be reverent

He waited until every eye had swung about to meet his Then he regarded
his abashed but excited hearers with a steady and prolonged stare

My friends he said let us bow in prayer

John Ellery could have repeated that prayer almost word for word years
after that night The captain prayed for the few here gathered together
Let them be steadfast Let them be constant in the way The path they
were treading might be narrow and beset with thorns but it was the path
leading to glory

Scoffers may sneer he declared his voice rising they may make a
mock of us they may even come into Thy presence to laugh at us but
theirs is the laugh that turns to groanin O Lord strengthen us
tonight to speak whats in our hearts without fear Amen To
prophesy in Thy name To bid the mockers and them that daredare to
profane this sanctuary be careful Hired singers and trumpets and vain
shows we have not Thank the Lord Amen but the true faith and
the joy of it we do have Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory

And so on his remarks becoming more personal and ever pointing like
a compass needle to the occupant of that seat in the corner The
ministers determination to attend a ComeOuter meeting though it had
reached the sticking point only a half hour before was the result of
considerable deliberation He had argued with himself and had made up
his mind to find out for himself just what these people did He was
finding out certainly His motives were good and he had come with no
desire to scoff but for the life of him he could not help feeling
like a criminal Incidentally it provoked him to feel that way

O Lord prayed Captain Hammond the perspiration in beads on his
forehead Thou hast said that the pastors become brutish and have not
sought Thee and that they shant prosper Help us tonight to labor with
this one that he may see his error and repent in sackcloth and ashes

They sang once more a hymn that prophesied woe to the unbeliever
Then Ezekiel Bassett rose to testify The testimony was mainly to the
effect that he was happy because he had fled to the ark of safety while
there was yet time

I found out he shouted that fancy music andahandahsot
sermons and fine duds and suchlike want goin to do ME no good
I needed somethin else I needed good times in my religion
Hallelujah and Ive found em right here Yes sir right here
And I say this out loud turning to glare at the intruder and I dont
care who comes to poke fun at me for sayin it Amen

A sharpnosed female followed Mr Bassett She spoke with evident
feeling and in a voice that trembled and shook when her emotion carried
it aloft SHED had enough of hightoned religion Yes and of them that
upheld it When her brother Simeon was took bad with phthisic wheezin
like a busted bellerses and twas up and down trot trot trot to
fetch and carry for him day in and night out did the folks from the
Reglar church help her She guessed NOT The only one that came nigh
her was Laviny Pepper and she came only to gas and gabble and find out
things that want none of her business What help she got was from
a ComeOuter from Eben Hammond bless his good soul Amen That
phthisic settled her for Reglarism Yes and for them that preached it
too So there

Captain Eben called for more testimony But the testifiers were to use
the old minstrel joke backward in coming forward that evening At an
ordinary meeting by this time the shouts and enthusiasm would have
been at their height and half a dozen ComeOuters on their feet at once
relating their experiences and proclaiming their happiness But tonight
there was a damper the presence of the leader of the opposition cast a
shadow over the gathering Only the bravest attempted speech The others
sat silent showing their resentment and contempt by frowning glances
over their shoulders and portentous nods one to the other

Come brethren commanded the captain sharply we are waitin to hear
you Are you afraid If your faith is real nothin nor nobody should
keep you from cryin it out loud Now if ever is the accepted time
Speak up for the spirit thats in you

An elderly man grave and quiet arose and said a few words dignified
and solemn words of prayer and thankfulness for the comfort this little
society of true believers had been to him Ellery realized that here
was another sort of ComeOuter one of the Hammond type Evidently they
were not all like Ezekiel and the shrillvoiced woman

Then from the settee in front of him rose the lengthy and fishy person
with the cowhide boots and enormous hands His name was Josiah Badger
and he was according to Trumets estimate a little mite lackin in
his top riggin He stuttered and this infirmity became more and more
apparent as he grew eloquent

II aint afraid he proclaimed They can call me a CCComeOuter
all they want to II dont care if they do Let em I say llet em
They can pppoke their fun and ppppuppuppoke it but I tell em
to hheave ahead and ppuppupPOKE When I used to ggo to their old
Reglar meetin house all I done was to go to sleep But I dont go
to sleep here glory hallelujah No sir Theres too much bbblessed
noise and we have too ggood times to ggo to sleep here That old
KKyan Pepper called me ttown ffool tother day Ttuttown fools
what he called me Says I to him says I Youyouyyou aint got spunk
enough to be a fool I says unless Laviny says you ccan be You old
Reglar pppepper shaker you

By this time teehees from the children and chuckles from some of the
older members interfered with Mr Badgers fervent but jerky discourse
Captain Eben struck the table smartly

Silence he thundered Silence Brother Badger I beg your pardon for
em Go on

But Josiahs train of thought had evidently been derailed by the
interruption

III callate thats about all he stammered and sat down

The captain looked over the meeting

Im ashamed he said ashamed of the behavior of some of us in the
Lords house This has been a failure this service of ours We have
kept still when we should have justified our faith and allowed the
presence of a stranger to interfere with our duty to the Almighty And
I will say he added his voice rising and trembling with indignation
to him who came here uninvited and broke up this meetin that it would
be well for him to remember the words of Scriptur Woe unto ye false
prophets and workers of iniquity Let him remember what the Divine
wisdom put into my head to read tonight The pastors have become
brutish and have not sought the Lord therefore they shall not
prosper

Amen Amen Amen So be it The cries came from all parts of the
little room They ceased abruptly for John Ellery was on his feet

Captain Hammond he said I realize that I have no right to speak in
this building but I must say one word My coming here tonight may have
been a mistake Im inclined to think it was But I came not as you
seem to infer to sneer or to scoff certainly I had no wish to disturb
your service I came because I had heard repeatedly since my arrival
in this town of this society and its meetings I had heard too that
there seemed to be a feeling of antagonism almost hatred against me
among you here I couldnt see why Most of you have I believe been at
one time members of the church where I preach I wished to find out for
myself how much of truth there was in the stories I had heard and to
see if a better feeling between the two societies might not be brought
about Those were my reasons for coming here tonight As for my being
a false prophet and a worker of iniquityhe smiledwell there is
another verse of Scripture I would call to your attention Judge not
that ye be not judged

He sat down There was silence for a moment and then a buzz of
whispering Captain Eben who had heard him with a face of iron
hardness rapped the table

We will sing in closin he said the fortysecond hymn After which
the benediction will be pronounced

The Regular minister left the ComeOuters meeting with the unpleasant
conviction that he had blundered badly His visit instead of tending
toward better understanding and more cordial relationship had
been regarded as an intrusion He had been provoked into a public
justification and now he was quite sure that he would have been more
politic to remain silent He realized that the evenings performance
would cause a sensation and be talked about all over town The
ComeOuters would glory in their leaders denunciation of him and his
own people would perhaps feel that it served him right If he had only
told Mrs Coffin of what he intended to do Yet he had not told her
because he meant to do it anyhow Altogether it was a rather humiliating
business

So that old bigot was the Van Horne girls uncle It hardly seemed
possible that she who appeared so refined and ladylike when he met her
at the parsonage should be a member of that curious company When
he rose to speak he had seen her in the front row beside the thin
middleaged female who had entered the chapel with Captain Hammond and
with her She was looking at him intently The lamp over the speakers
table had shone full on her face and the picture remained in his memory
He saw her eyes and the wavy shadows of her hair on her forehead

He stepped off the platform across the road out of the way of
homewardbound ComeOuters and stood there thinking The fog was
as heavy and wet as ever in fact it was almost a rain The wind
was blowing hard from the northwest The congregation dispersed in
chattering groups their lanterns dipping and swinging like fireflies
The chatter dealt entirely with one subjecthimself He heard his name
mentioned at least twenty times Out of the gusty dripping blackness
came Mr Badgers voice

By time crowed Josiah he was took down a few pppuppegs want
he My how Eben did ggigigive it to him He looked tolerble white
under the gills when he riz up to heave out his sssussassy talk And
foolish too I callate I wont be the only town fuffuffool from now
on He he

The noises died away in the distance Within the chapel the tramp
of heavy boots sounded as the lights were blown out one by one The
minister frowned sighed and turned homeward It is not pleasant to be
called a fool even by a recognized member of the fraternity

He had taken but a few steps when there was a rustle in the wet grass
behind him

Mr Ellery whispered a voice Mr Ellery may I speak to you just a
moment

He wheeled in surprise

Why why Miss Van Horne he exclaimed Is it you

Mr Ellery she began speaking hurriedly and in a low voice II
felt that I must say a word to you before

She paused and glanced back at the chapel Ezekiel Bassett the janitor
having extinguished the last lamp had emerged from the door and was
locking up In another moment he clumped past them in the middle of the
road the circle of light from his lantern just missing them as they
stood in the grass at the side under the hornbeam and blackberry bushes
He was alone Sukey B had gone on before other and younger masculine
escort having been providentially provided

Mr Bassett was out of hearing before Grace finished her sentence The
minister was silent waiting and wondering

I felt she said that I must see you andexplain I am SO sorry you
came here tonight Oh I wish you hadnt What made you do it

I came began Ellery somewhat stiffly because Iwell because I
thought it might be a good thing to do As I said

Yes I know But it wasnt It was soso

So foolish Thank you Im aware of it Ive heard myself called a
fool already since I left your church Not that I needed to hear it I
realize the fact

There was a bitterness in his tone unmistakable And a little laugh
from his companion did not tend to soothe his feelings

Thank you he said Perhaps it is funny I did not find it so Good
evening

This was priggish but it must be borne in mind that John Ellery was
very very fresh from the theological school where young divines are
taught to take themselves seriously He was ashamed of himself as soon
as he said it which proved that his case was not beyond hope

The girl detained him as he was turning away

I wasnt laughing at that she said I know who called you thatthat
name It was Josiah Badger and he really is one you know I was
thinking of his testimony in meeting and how he called KyAbishaia
pepper shaker That was ridiculous enough but it reminded me of
something else about Mr Pepper and I HAD to laugh It wasnt at you
truly

So the minister begged her pardon also he remained where he was and
heard the drops from the tree patter hollow on his hat

I came after you went on Grace rapidly and with nervous haste
because I felt that you ought not to misjudge my uncle for what he said
tonight He wouldnt have hurt your feelings for the world He is a
good man and does good to everybody If you only knew the good he does
do you wouldntyou wouldnt DARE think hardly of him

She stamped her foot in the wet grass as she said it She was evidently
in earnest But Ellery was not in the mood to be greatly impressed
by Eben Hammonds charity or innate goodness The old tavern keepers
references to himself were too fresh in his mind False prophet and
worker of iniquity

Im not judging your uncle he declared It seemed to me that the
boot was on the other leg

I know but you do judge him and you mustnt You see he thought
you had come to make fun of himand us Some of the Regular people do
people who arent fit to tie his shoes And so he spoke against you
Hell be sorry when he thinks it over Thats what I came to tell you I
ask your pardon forfor him

Whywhy thats all right I think I understood

Im not asking it because hes a ComeOuter and youre a Regular
minister He isnt ashamed of his religion Neither am I Im a
ComeOuter too

Yes II supposed you were

Yes I am There good night Mr Ellery All I ask is that you dont
think too hardly of uncle He didnt mean it

She turned away now and it was the minister who detained her

Ive been thinking he said slowly for in his present state of mind
it was a hard thing to say that perhaps I ought to apologize too
Im afraid I did disturb your service and Im sorry I meant well
butWhats that Rain

There was no doubt about it it was rain and plenty of it It came in
a swooping downpour that beat upon the trees and bushes and roared upon
the roof of the chapel The minister hurriedly raised his umbrella

Here he cried let meMiss Van Horne Where are you

The answer came from a short distance down the Turnoff

Good night called the girl I must run

Evidently she WAS running Therefore the young man ran after her He
caught up with her in a moment in spite of some stumbles over the rough
road

Here he commanded you must take the umbrella Really you must You
havent one and youll be wet through

She pushed the umbrella aside

No no she answered I dont need it Im used to wet weather truly
I am And I dont care for this hat its an old one You have a long
way to go and I havent Please Mr Ellery I cant take it

Very well was the sternly selfsacrificing reply then I shall
certainly go with you

But I dont wish you to

I cant help that Im not going to let you go unprotected through
this flood Especially as you might have been at home before this if you
hadnt stopped to speak with me

But you mustnt

I shall

Here was the irresistible force and the immovable object They stood
stock still in the middle of the road while the rain drops jumped as
they struck the umbrella top The immovable object being feminine
voiced the unexpected

All right she said then I suppose I shall have to take it

What

The umbrella Im sorry and youll get dreadfully wet but its your
own fault

He could feel her hand near his own on the handle He did not relinquish
his grasp

No he said I think on the whole that that is unreasonable I
SHOULD get wet and though I dont mind it when it is necessary I

Well rather sharply what are you going to do

Go with you as far as your gate Im sorry if my company is
distasteful but

He did not finish the sentence thinking it may be that she might
finish it for him But she was silent merely removing her hand from the
handle She took a step forward he followed holding the umbrella above
her head They plashed on without speaking through the rapidly forming
puddles

Presently she stumbled and he caught her arm to prevent her falling To
his surprise he felt that arm shake in his grasp

Why Miss Van Horne he exclaimed in great concern are you crying
I beg your pardon Of course I wouldnt think of going another step with
you I didnt mean to trouble you I onlyIf you will please take this
umbrella

Again he tried to transfer the umbrella and again she pushed it away

IIm not crying she gasped butoh dear this is SO funny

Mr Ellery gazed blankly at her through the rainstreaked dark This was
the most astonishing young person he had met in his twentythree years
of worldly experience

Funny he repeated Well perhaps it is Our ideas of fun seem to
differ I

Oh but it IS so funny You dont understand What do you think your
congregation would say if they knew you had been to a ComeOuters
meeting and then insisted on seeing a ComeOuter girl home

John Ellery swallowed hard A vision of Captain Elkanah Daniels and the
stately Miss Annabel rose before his minds eye He hadnt thought of
his congregation in connection with this impromptu rescue of a damsel in
distress

Ha ha he laughed mournfully I guess it is rather funny after
all

It certainly is Now will you leave me and go back to your parsonage

Not unless you take the umbrella

Very well It is a beautiful evening for a walk dont you think so
Mr Ellery Im afraid we shant have you with us in Trumet very long

Why not

Oh because youre so very very original Are your sermons that way
too Captain Elkanah doesnt like his ministers to be too original

The minister set his teeth At that moment he felt an intense desire
to bid the Daniels family mind their own business Then another thought
struck him

Possibly your Uncle Eben might be somewhatersurprised if he
knew you were with me Perhaps he might have something to say on the
subject

I guess he would We shall know very soon I ran away and left him with
Mrs Poundberry our housekeeper He doesnt know where I am I wonder
he hasnt turned back to look for me before this We shall probably meet
him at any moment

She seemed to enjoy the prospect of the meeting Ellery wondered what on
earth he should say to Captain Hammondthat is provided he was allowed
to say anything

Suddenly a heavier gust of rain and wind beat upon them The minister
struggled with the umbrella The gust passed and with it the fog An
instant before it had been all about them shutting them within inky
walls Now it was not Through the rain he could see the shadowy
silhouettes of bushes at the road side Fifty yards away the lighted
windows of the Hammond tavern gleamed yellow Farther on over a ragged
moving fringe of grass and weeds was a black flat expansethe bay And
a little way out upon that expanse twinkled the lights of a vessel A
chain rattled Voices shouting exultingly came to their ears

Why exclaimed Grace in excited wonder its the packet She was due
this morning but we didnt expect her in till tomorrow How did she
find her way in the fog I must tell uncle

She started to run toward the house The minister would have followed
with the umbrella but she stopped him

No Mr Ellery she urged earnestly No please dont Im all right
now Thank you Good night

A few steps farther on she turned

I hope Capn Elkanah wont know she whispered the laugh returning to
her voice Good night

Ellery stood still in the rain and watched her He saw her pass the
lighted windows and open a door Into the yellow radiance she flashed
and disappeared A minute more and the bulky form of Eben Hammond
lantern in hand a souwester on his head and his shoulders working
themselves into an oilskin coat burst out of the door and hurriedly
limped down toward the shore On the threshold framed in light stood
his ward gazing after him And the minister gazed at her

From the bay came the sound of oars in rowlocks A boat was approaching
the wharf And suddenly from the boat came a hail

Halloo Ahoy dad Is that you

There was an answering shout from the wharf a shout of joy Then
a rattle of oars and a clamor of talk And Grace still stood in the
doorway waiting

The lantern bobbed up the slope As it reached the tavern gateway the
minister saw that it was now carried by a tall active man who walked
with a seamans stride and roll Captain Eben was close beside him
talking excitedly

They entered the yard

Grace Grace screamed Captain Eben Gracie girl look whos come
Look

The tall man ran forward

Hi Grace he cried in a deep hearty voice Is that you Aint you
got a word for your old messmate

The girl stepped out into the rain

Why why NAT she cried

The big man picked her up bodily in his arms and carried her into the
house Captain Eben followed and the door closed

John Ellery picked his way homeward through the puddles and the pouring
rain

He found Keziah in the sitting room seated by the table evidently
writing a letter She looked tired and gravefor her

Well she exclaimed as he entered I guess youre soppin now sartin
sure Theres a light in your room Take off your wet things and throw
em down to me and Ill dry em in the kitchen Better leave your boots
here now and stand that umbrella in the sink The kettles on the stove
youd better have somethin hotginger tea or somethin I told you not
to go out such a night as this Where in the world have you been

The minister said he would tell her all about it in the morning Just
now he thought he had better go up and take off his wet clothes He
declined the ginger tea and after removing his boots went upstairs to
his room

Keziah dipped her pen in the ink and went on with her letter

I inclose ten dollars she wrote It is all I can send you now More
than I ought to afford Goodness knows why I send anything You dont
deserve it But while I live and you do I cant

The minister called from the landing

Here is my coat he said The cuffs and lower part of the sleeves are
pretty wet By the way the packet came in tonight They didnt expect
her so soon on account of the fog There was a passenger aboard whom I
think must be that Nathaniel Hammond you told me of

Keziahs pen stopped The wet coat struck the hall floor with a soft
thump The tick of the clock sounded loud in the room A sheet of
winddriven rain lashed the windows

Did you hear called the minister I said that Nathaniel Hammond
Captain Ebens son came on the packet I didnt meet him but Im sure
it was he ErMrs Coffin are you there Do you hear me

The housekeeper laid the pen down beside the unfinished letter

Yes she said I hear you Good night

For minutes she sat there leaning back in her chair and staring at the
wall Then she rose went into the hall picked up the coat and took it
out into the kitchen where she hung it on the clotheshorse by the cook
stove After a while she returned to the table and took up the pen Her
face in the lamplight looked more tired and grave than ever

It was a long time before John Ellery fell asleep He had much to think
ofof the morrow of the talk his rash visit to the chapel would cause
of the explanation he must make to Captain Elkanah and the rest But the
picture that was before his closed eyes as he lay there was neither of
Captain Elkanah nor the parish committee it was that of a girl with
dark hair and a slim graceful figure standing in a lighted doorway and
peering out into the rain


CHAPTER VI

IN WHICH OLD FRIENDS MEET


When Ellery came down to breakfast the rain was over the wind had
gone down and the morning sunshine was pouring in at the diningroom
windows Outside the lilacs were in bud the bluebirds were singing and
there was a sniff of real spring in the air The storm was at an end and
yet the young minister was conscious of a troublesome feeling that for
him it was just beginning

However he had determined while dressing to make a clean breast of it
to his housekeepera nominally clean breast that is There were some
things he would not tell her some that he would not speak of to anyone
the picture in the doorway for instance True it was only a picture
and of no moment but it was pleasant to remember One of the very few
pleasant things connected with the previous evening

So as they sat opposite each other at the table he began his
confession The muffins scorched in the oven and the coffeepot boiled
over as he told his story for Keziah was too much interested to think
of trifles Interested and astounded for since ComeOuters had been
ComeOuters and the split in the society took place no Regular minister
had crossed the threshold of a seceders dwelling much less attended
their services and walked home with a member of their congregation She
knew what this amazing procedure was likely to mean if her parson did
not

Well she exclaimed when the recital was finished Well

IIm afraid I was too hasty observed Mr Ellery thoughtfully
Perhaps it would have been wiser not to have done it

Perhaps twould Yes I wouldnt wonder a mite

It will be talked about some I suppose Dont you think so

Some yes

Im afraid some of my own people may think it queer

Queer Say Mr Ellery you remind me of a halfbreed Portugee
fellerhalf Portugee and a half Indianthat went to sea with my
father back in the old days He hardly ever spoke a word mainly
grunted and made signs One day he and another fomast hand went aloft
in a calm to do somethin to the topsl The halfbreedthey called him
Billy Peter and he always called himself thatwas out on the end of
the yard with his foot on the rope underneath I forget the name of it
when the tarred twine he had for a shoe string caught Tryin to get
it loose it broke sudden his shoe pulled off he lost his balance and
fell He grabbed at the yard saved himself for a second fell again
grabbed the next yard then a rope and so on down grabbin and pullin
all the way First his shoe hit the deck then his sheath knife then
a piece of rope and finally himself landin right on top of the Irish
cook who was goin aft from the galley with fathers dinner

There was the greatest racket you ever heard pans fallin dishes
smashin men yellin and the cook swearin Father run on deck
thinkin the ship was dismasted He found the cook and Billy Peter
sittin in the middle of the mess lookin at each other Neither was
hurt a mite The mates and the crew part of em was standin starin
at the pair

For Heaven sakes says father what happened

The halfbreed looked up and rubbed his head Ugh says he Billy
Peter bust his shoe string

The cook his name was ONeill looked at him disgusted Well
begorra says he Billy Peter you dont exaggerate none do ye Its
a good thing BOTH of em didnt bust or wed have foundered

You remind me of Billy Peter Mr Ellery you dont exaggerate Queer
Some folks think your goin to that meetin last night QUEER At this
moment one half of Trumet is talkin about it and runnin out to tell
the other half I guess Id better hurry up with this breakfast Were
goin to have callers

Strange to say however this prophecy of early morning visitors did
not prove true Nine oclock then ten and no visitor came to the
parsonage Mrs Coffin affirmed that she did not understand it Where
was Didama Where Lavinia Pepper Had the Trumet Daily Advertiser
suspended publication

At half past ten the gate slammed Keziah peered from the window

Humph she ejaculated Here comes Elkanah and hes got storm signals
set by the looks Hes comin after you Mr Ellery

Very well was the calm reply let him come

What are you goin to say to him

Nothing except that I did what I considered right at the time Show
him into the study Mrs Coffin please

Captain Daniels marched to the diningroom door his goldheaded cane
marking time like a drumbeat He nodded curtly to Keziah who answered
the knock and stepped across the threshold

Humha he barked Is the ministerhumha is Mr Ellery in

Yes hes in

Tell him I want to see him

The housekeeper announced the visitor

Hes as sour as a skimmin of last weeks milk she whispered Dont
be afraid of him though

Oh Im not Show him in

All right Say Mr Ellery its none of my business but I wouldnt
say anything about your seein Grace home Thats none of HIS business
either or anybody elses

The head of the parish committee stalked into the study and the
door closed behind him A rumble of voices in animated conversation
succeeded

Mrs Coffin went out into the kitchen and resumed her business of making
a driedapple pie There was a hot fire in the stove and she opened the
back door to let in the fresh air She worked briskly rolling out the
dough filling the deep dish and pinking the edges of the upper crust
with a fork She was thinking as she worked but not of the minister or
his visitor

She put the pie in the oven and set the damper And as she knelt by the
stove something struck her lightly on the back of the neck She looked
up and about her but there was no one in sight Then she picked up the
object which had struck her It was a cranberry withered and softened
by the winter frosts

She looked at the cranberry then at the open door and her eyes
twinkled Running quickly to the threshold she peered out The back yard
was apparently empty save for a few hens belonging to near neighbors
and these had stopped scratching for a living and were huddled near the
fence

Hum she mused You rascal Eddie Snow if its you Ill be after
you in a minute Just because youre big enough to quit school and drive
store wagon is no reason why I cantHey Oh

She was looking down below the door which opened outward and was swung
partly back on its hinges From under the door projected a boot a mans
boot and one of ample size

Keziahs cheeks already red from the heat of the stove reddened still
more Her lips twitched and her eyes sparkled

Hum she said again They say you can tell the Old Scratch by his
footprints even if you cant smell the sulphur Anyhow you can tell
a Hammond by the size of his boots Come out from behind that door this
minute Aint you ashamed of yourself

The owner of the boot stepped forth from behind the door and seized her
by both hands

Halloo Keziah he cried joyfully My but its good to see you

Halloo Nat said Keziah heartily Its kind of good to see you
too

The rest of him was in keeping with his boots He was big and
broadshouldered and bearded His face above the beard was tanned to a
deep reddish brown and the corners of his eyes were marked with dozens
of tiny wrinkles He was dressed in blue cloth and wore a widebrimmed
soft felt hat He entered the kitchen and tossed the hat into a corner

Well he exclaimed Why dont you act surprised to see a feller Here
Ive been cruisin from the Horn to Barnegat and back again and you
act as if Id just dropped in to fetch the cup of molasses I borrowed
yesterday What do you mean by it

Oh I heard youd made port

Did hey Thats Trumet sure pop You aint the only one I sneaked
off acrost lots sos to dodge the gang of neighbors that I knew would
be sailin into our yard the whole fleet loaded to the gunwale with
questions Wanted to see you first Keziah

Yes So instead of callin like a Christian you crept up the back way
and threw cranberries at me Aint you ashamed of yourself

Not a mite He took a handful of the frostbitten berries from his
coat pocket and inspected them lovingly Aint they fine he asked
crunching two or three between his teeth I picked em up as I came
along I tell you thats the home taste all right

Dont eat those frozen things Theyll give you your nevergetover

What Cape Cod cranberries Never in the world Id rather eat sand
down here than the finest mug my steward can cook Tell you what Ill
do though Ill swear off on the cranberries if youll give me a
fourinch slice of that pie I saw you put in the oven Driedapple Ill
bet my souwester Think you might ask a feller to sit down Aint you
glad to see me

Mrs Coffin pulled forward one of the kitchen chairs He seated himself
on it and it groaned under his weight

Whew he whistled Never made to stand rough weather was it Well
AINT you glad

Keziah looked at him gravely

You know Im glad Nat she said

So I hoped you would be but I did want to hear you say it Now you
come to anchor yourself and lets have a talk Ive been countin on it
ever since we set topsls off Surinam

The housekeeper took the other chair

How are you she began He stopped her

Sshh he interrupted Dont say anything for a minute Let me look
at you Just as clean and wholesome and goodlookin as ever They dont
make girls like that anywhere else but down on this old sand bar Not a
day older by the jumpin

She held up her hand

Hush Nat she protested dont talk foolish Girl Not a day older
Why if feelins count for anything Im as old as Methusaleh Havent I
had enough to make me old

He was grave immediately

I beg your pardon Keziah he said Im a dough head thats a fact
I hadnt forgot about Sol but I was so glad to be home again and to see
dad and Grace and the old town and you that everything else flew out of
my mind Poor Sol I liked him

He liked you too No wonder considerin what you did to

Belay Never mind that Poor chap Well hes rid of his sufferins at
last Tell me about it if you can without bringin all the trouble back
too plain

So she told him of her brothers sickness and death of having to give
up the old home and finally of her acceptance of the housekeepers
position He listened at first with sympathy and then with suppressed
indignation

By the jumpin Moses he exclaimed And Elkanah was goin to turn you
out of house and home The mean pompous old

Hush hush hes in there with Mr Ellery

Who Elkanah

Yes theyre in the study

By the jumpinLet me talk to him for a few minutes ILL tell him
whats good for his health You just listen

He rose from the chair but she made him sit down again

No no she protested He wasnt to blame He had to have his rent
and I didnt feel that I could afford to keep up a whole house just for
myself And besides I ought to be thankful to him I suppose He got
me this place

He did

Yes he did I rather guess Zeb Mayo or somebody may have suggested it
to him first but

Humph I rather guess so too

Well you cant always tell Sometimes when you really get inside of a
person you find a generous streak that

Not in a Daniels Anybody that got inside of Elkanah would find nothin
but Elkanah there and twould be crowded at that So hes talkin to
the new parson hey Bossin him too Ill bet

I aint so sure Mr Ellerys young but hes got a mind of his own

Captain Hammond chuckled and slapped his knee

Ho ho he laughed Ive been hearin somethin about that mind Went
to the chapel last night I understand and he and dad had a setto Oh
I heard about it Wish I might have been there

How does your father act about it

Bout the way a redhot stove acts when you spill water on it every
time he thinks of the minister he sizzles Ho ho I do wish I could
have been there

What does Grace say

Oh she doesnt say much I wouldnt wonder if she felt the way I do
though we both keep quiet Ill tell you between ourselves and the
ships pump that I sort of glory in the young chaps spunk

Good So do I I like him

See here Keziah Im gettin frightened You aint settin your cap to
be a parsons wife are you Because

Dont be silly I might adopt him but thats all I guess

Her friend leaned forward

Keziah he said earnestly theres no sense in your slavin yourself
to death here I can think of a good deal pleasanter berth than that
Pleasanter for me anyhow and Id do my best to make it pleasant for
you Youve only got to say the word andNo Well then all I can do is
hope through another voyage

Please dont Nat You know

No I dont know

Well perhaps you dont But I know I like you Nat I count on you as
the straightest truest friend Ive got and I want to keep on countin
on you just that way Maynt I

Course you can Keziah But

Then dont say another word please

He sighed and looked out at the open door The kitchen clock ticked loud
in the silence

All right he said at last All right but Im goin to keep on
hopin

You mustnt Nat

Keziah when you set your foot down youre pretty stubborn but Ive
got somethin of a foot myself You remember you said so a few minutes
ago Hi hum Well speakin of dad reminds me that Im kind of worried
about him

You are Why Isnt he well

Pretty well but he aint strong and he gets too excited over things
like last nights foolishness Grace tells me that the doctor says he
must be careful or hell drop off sudden some of these days He had a
shock five or six years ago a little one and Ive been anxious about
him ever since Ive got to go to New York off and on for the next
month after that I hope to be home for a spell and I can keep an eye on
him Keziah if youll listen Ill whisper somethin to youreligions
a good thing and sos a mustard plaster but both of em can be put on
too strong Dad is just a little mite crazy on ComeOuters Im afraid

Oh no I guess not You mustnt worry How did Grace look to you

Like the harbor light on a stormy night Shes a brick that girl and
gets prettier every minute Wonder to me some of the young chaps down
here dont carry her off by main strength Shell make somebody a good
wife

Umhm Havehave you ever thought of her that way yourself

Keziah

Well dont get mad I think a lot of Grace and I dont know anyone
Id rather see you marry

I do Keziah thats enough of that Are you and dad in partnership to
get me spliced and out of the way He was at me this mornin along the
same line Dont say anything like that again even in fun YOU know
why

All right all right Now tell me about yourself Have you had a good
voyage How do you like your owners How did Zach Foster ever get the
packet in through yesterdays fog

Voyage was all right Some rugged weather on the trip out but homeward
bound we slid along like a slush bucket on a greased plank Owners
are all right Good people as ever I sailed for As for Zach and the
packetHo ho

He laughed rocking back and forth on the chair which creaked in
sympathy

Whats the joke demanded the housekeeper Dont do that That chair
wasnt made for elephants to use

Hey Tis pretty weak in the knees aint it Dad would say twas a
piece with the creed of those that owned it IWhats that Somebodys
comin Im goin to clear out I dont want to be put through my
catechism yet a while

No you mustnt go I want you to meet Mr Ellery You sit out on
the wash bench by the back door till I get rid of whoever tis thats
comin Scoot

Nat scooted stopping to snatch up his hat as he ran Keziah went into
the dining room and admitted Captain Zebedee Mayo who was panting from
the exertion of his walk

Whew puffed Captain Zeb mopping his forehead How be you Keziah
What You aint all alone Thought youd have a cabin full of gab
machines by this time Have they been and gone

No they havent been IMy land my pie

She rushed into the kitchen and snatched the pastry from the oven Her
new caller followed her

So they aint been hey he said Thats queer

Elkanahs here Hes in there with the minister now

He is Givin the young feller Hail Columby I callate Well now
he shant He he When they told me how the minister passed old
hopandgofetchit what was due him at the chapel last night I riz up
and hoorayed till my wife shut the windows She said the neighbors all
thought I was loony anyhow and I neednt prove it to em He he But
Elkanah aint got any funny bone Hes as solemn as a stuffed owl and
hellWell Im goin to put MY oar in Im parish committee too I
callate and Ive got somethin to say even if I want christened
Daniels Here goes

He headed for the study but before he crossed the threshold of the
kitchen Ellery and his visitor came out into the dining room Captain
Elkanahs face was flushed and he fidgeted The minister looked
determined but calm

Ahoy there Elkanah hailed Zebedee cheerfully Mornin Mr Ellery
Been havin officers counsel have you

Good morning Captain Mayo said the minister

Mornin Zebedee grunted Elkanah I havehumhabeen
discussing the regrettable affair of last night with Mr Ellery I have
triedhumha to show him that respectable people of our society dont
associate with ComeOuters and that for a Regular minister to go to
their meetings is something neither the congregation nor the parish
committee approves of Noerhumha no

And I explained to Captain Daniels observed the minister that I
went there for what seemed to me good reasons and as they did seem to
me good at the time Im not ashamed of having gone It was an honest
mistake on my part and I may make more

But the society began Elkanah Captain Zeb interrupted him

Dont worry about the society Mr Ellery he said with emphasis Nor
about the parish committee either Great fishhooks the most of us are
tickled to death over what you said to Eben Hammond We think its a
mighty good joke YOU didnt know of course and what you did was done
innocent He he he Did you lay him out hey

Zebedee began Captain Daniels I must say I cant see anything to
laugh at

You never could Elkanah I remember that time when you and me and some
of the fellers home from sea went out sailin and the boom knocked you
overboard with your Sunday clothes on Lordy how the rest of us did
holler but you never cracked a smile If youd seen yourself when we
hauled you in whiskers runnin salt water beaver hat lookin like a
drownded kitten

There There Never mind that I think youll find a good many of the
society feel as I do shocked andhumhasorry Im surprised they
havent been here to say so

I expected them remarked the minister

So did I chimed in Captain Zeb But I callate to know why they
aint been Theyre all too busy crowin over the way Nat Hammond
fetched the packet home last night WHAT You aint heard Great
fishhooks its the best thing ever

Ive heard about it snapped Elkanah impatiently Mr Ellery Im
glad you realize that your action was a mistake and I will take pains to
have that immejitly made plain to

YOU aint heard Keziah have you broke in Zebedee Nor you Mr
Ellery Well I must tell you Heres where I gain a lap on Didama
Rogers Seems the Deborah Sthats the packets name Mr Elleryshe
hauled out of Boston night afore last on the ebb with a fair wind and
sky clear as a bell But they hadnt much moren got outside of Minots
fore the fog shut down thickern gruel for a sick rich man The wind
held till long toward mornin then she flattened to a dead calm Bije
Perry the mate he spun the yarn to me and he said twas thick and
flat as ever he see and kept gettin no better fast

They drifted along till noon time and then they was somewheres out in
the bay but thats about all you could say Zach he was stewin and
sputterin like a pair of fried eels and Lafayette Gage and Emulous
Peterstheyre Denboro folks Mr Ellery and about sixteen pints
tother side of no accountthey was the only passengers aboard except
Nat Hammond and they put in their time playin high low jack in the
cabin The lookout was forard tootin a tin horn and his bellerin
was the most excitin thing goin on After dinnercorned beef and
cabbagetrust Zach for that though its next door to cannibalism to
put cabbage in HIS mouthafter dinner all hands was on deck when Nat
says Hush he says Dont I hear somethin

They listened and then they all heard itall cept Zach whos deef
in his larboard ear

Stand by roars Nat Its a squall dead astern and comin abilin
Ill take her Bije You look out for them topsls

So Nat grabs the wheel and Bije tears forard and sends the two
fomast hands aloft on the jump Zach was skipper but all he done was
race around and holler and trip over his own feet Oh hes a prize
sailor he is Dont talk to me about them Fosters I

Nobody is talkin about em but you Zeb observed Keziah drily Go
on How about the squall

It hit em fore they got even one topsl clewed down That one the
foretopsl twas split to rags The main topsl was set and when the
squall struck the rotten old topmast went by the board Kerrasho
Course splinters flew like all possessed and one of em about a foot
long sailed past Nats head where he stood heavin his whole weight on
the wheel and lit right on the binnacle smashin it to matches

They say Nat never paid the least attention no moren if the chunk of
wood had been a June bug buzzin past He just held that wheel hard down
and that saved the packet She come around and put her nose dead in
the wind just in time As twas Bije says there was a second when the
water by her lee rail looked right underneath him as he hung onto the
deck with finger nails and teeth

Well there they was afloat but with their upper riggin gone and
the compass smashed flat A howlin nothwester blowin and fog thick as
ever Zach was a whimperin fidgetin old woman Lafayette and Emulous
was prayin in the scuppersand that aint an exercise theyre used to
neitherand even Bije was mighty shook up and worriedhe says he was
himself But Nat Hammond was as cool and refreshin as the bottom of my
well up home

Better clear away that mess aloft hadnt you he says to the
skipper

Zach said he guessed so he want sure of nothin However they
cleared it away and incidentally Bije yanked the prayer meetin out
of the scuppers and set em to work Then Nat suggests gettin the spare
compass and lo and behold you there want any Compasses cost money
and moneys made to keep so Zach thinks

So there they was Wind was fair or ought to be but twas blowin
hard and so thick you couldnt hardly see the jib boom Zach he wanted
to anchor then he didnt then he did and so on Nobody paid much
attention to him

Whatll we do Nat says Bije He knew who was the real seaman
aboard

Keep her as she is dead afore it if you ask me says Nat Guess
well hit the broadside of the cape somewheres if this gale holds

So they kept her as she was And it got to be night and they knew
theyd ought to be most onto the edge of the flats off here if their
recknin was nigh right They hove the lead and got five fathom No
flats about that

Zach was for anchorin again What do you think Nat asks Bije

Anchor of course if you want to Nat says Youre runnin this
craft Im only passenger

But what do you THINK whines Zach Cant you tell us what you do
think

Well if twas me I wouldnt anchor till I had to Probly twill
fair off tomorrow but if it shouldnt we might have to lay out here
all day Anyhow wed have to wait for a full tide

Im afraid were off the course says Bije else wed been acrost
the bar by this time

Well Nat tells him if we are off the course and too far inshore
we would have made the barthe Bayport barif not the Trumet one And
if were off the course and too far out wed ought to have deeper water
than five fathom hadnt we Course Im not sure butWhats that
landsman

Three and a half sir says the feller with the lead That showed
they was edgin in somewheres Nat he sniffed for all the world like a
dog catchin a scent so Bije declares

I can smell home he says

Three fathom the lead give em then two and a half then a scant two
They was drawin six feet Zach couldnt stand it

Im goin to anchor he squeals frantic I believe were plumb over
to Wellmouth and drivin right onto Horsefoot Shoal

Its either that or the bar chimes in Bije And whichever tis we
cant anchor in the middle of it

But whatll we do shouts Zach Cant nobody say somethin to DO

Tell you I smell home says Nat calm and chipper and Id know that
smell if I met it in Jericho Ha there she deepens again That was the
bar and were over it

The wind had gone down to a stiff sailin breeze and the old Debby S
slapped along afore it Sometimes there was twelve foot under her keel
and sometimes eight or nine Once twas only seven and a half Zach and
Bije both looked at each other but Nat only smiled

Oh you can laugh hollers Zach Taint your vessel youre runnin
into danger YOU aint paid out your good money

Nat never answered but he stopped smilin

And all to once the water deepened Hammond swung her up into the wind

NOW you can anchor says he

And bout time too I guess says Bije I callate the skippers
right This IS Horsefoot and were right between the shoals Yes sir
and I hear breakers Lively there

They hove over the mudhook and dropped the sails Nat shook his head

Breakers or not says he I tell you Ive smelt home for the last
half hour Now by the jumpin Moses I can TASTE it

And inside of a couple of shakes come the rain It poured for a while
and then the fog cleared Right acrost their bows was Trumet with the
town clock strikin ten Over the flat place between the hills they
could see the light on the ocean side And they was anchored right
in the deep hole inside the breakwater as sure as Im knee high to a
marlin spike

Bije just stared at Hammond with his mouth open

Nat says he youre a seaman if I do say it I thought I was a
pretty good bay pilot but I cant steer a vessel without a compass
through a night as black as Pharaohs Egypt and in a thick fog besides
and land her square on top of her moorins If my hat want sloshin
around thirty mile astern I snum if I wouldnt take it off to you this
minute

Nat stammers Zach I must say I

Nat snapped him shut like a tobacco box You neednt says he But
Ill say this to you Zach Foster When I undertake to handle a vessel
I handle her best I know how and the fact that I dont own her makes no
difference to me You just put that down somewheres so you wont forget
it

And this mornin crowed Captain Zebedee concluding his long yarn
after that mind you that lubber Zach Foster is around town tellin
folks that his schooner had been over the course so often she COULDNT
get lost She found her way home herself WHAT do you think of that

The two members of the parish committee left the parsonage soon after
Captain Mayo had finished his story Elkanah had listened with growing
irritation and impatience Zebedee lingered a moment behind his
companions

Dont you fret yourself about what happened last night Mr Ellery
he whispered Itll be all right Course nobodyd want you to keep up
chummin in with ComeOuters but what you said to old Ebenll square
you this time So long

The minister shut the door behind his departing guests Then he went out
into the kitchen whither the housekeeper had preceded him He found her
standing on the back step looking across the fields The wash bench was
untenanted

Hum mused Ellery thoughtfully that was a good story of Captain
Mayos This man Hammond must be a fine chap I should like to meet
him

Keziah still looked away over the fields She did not wish her employer
to see her facejust then

I thought you would meet him she said He was here a little while
ago and I asked him to wait I guess Zebs yarn was too much for him he
doesnt like to be praised

So Was he here At the Regular parsonage Im surprised

He and I have known each other for a long while

Well Im sorry hes gone I think I should like him

Keziah turned from the door

I know you would she said


CHAPTER VII

IN WHICH CAPTAIN NAT PICKS UP A DERELICT


It is probable that John Ellery never fully realized the debt of
gratitude he owed to the fog and the squall and to Captain Nat Hammond
Trumet always hungry for a sensation would have thoroughly enjoyed
arguing and quarreling over the ministers visit to ComeOuter meeting
and during the fracas Keziahs parson might have been more or less
battered But Captain Nats brilliant piloting of the old packet was
a bit of seamanship which every man and woman on that foambordered
stretch of sand could understand and appreciate and the ministers
indiscretion was all but forgotten in consequence The Daily
Advertisers gloated over it of course and Captain Elkanah brought it
up at the meeting of the parish committee but there Captain Zeb Mayo
championed the young mans course and proclaimed that furs he was
concerned he was for Mr Ellery moren ever A young greenhorn
with the spunk to cruise singlehanded right into the middle of the
ComeOuter school and give an old bull whale like Eben the gaff is the
man for my money declared Zebedee Most of his fellowcommittee agreed
with him Not guilty but dont do it again was the general verdict

As for the ComeOuters they professed to believe that their leader had
much the best of the encounter so they were satisfied There was a
note of triumph and exultation in the testimony given on the following
Thursday night and Captain Eben divided his own discourse between
thankfulness for his sons safe return and glorification at the
discomfiture of the false prophets Practically then the result of
Ellerys peace overture was an increased bitterness in the feeling
between the two societies and a polishing of weapons on both sides

Keziah watched anxiously for a hint concerning her parsons walk in the
rain with Grace but she heard nothing so congratulated herself that
the secret had been kept Ellery did not again mention it to her nor
she to him A fortnight later he preached his great sermon on The
Voyage of Life and its reference to gales and calms and lee shores and
breakers made a hit His popularity took a big jump

He met Nat Hammond during that fortnight The first meeting was
accompanied by unusual circumstances which might have been serious but
were actually only funny

The tide at Trumet on the bay side goes out for a long way leaving
uncovered a mile and a half of flats bare and sandy or carpeted with
seaweed Between these flats are the channels varying at low water from
two to four feet in depth but deepening rapidly as the tide flows

The flats fascinated the young minister as they have many another
visitor to the Cape before or since On cloudy days they lowered with
a dull leaden luster and the weedgrown portions were like the dark
squares on a checkerboard while the deep water beyond the outer bar was
steely gray and angry When the sun shone and the wind blew clear from
the northwest the whole expanse flashed into fire and color sapphire
blue emerald green topaz yellow dotted with white shells and ablaze
with diamond sparkles where the reflected light leaped from the flint
crystals of the wet coarse sand

The best time to visit the flatstide serving of courseis the early
morning at sunrise Then there is an inspiration in the wide expanse a
snap and tang and joy in the air Ellery had made up his mind to take a
beforebreakfast tramp to the outer bar and so arose at five tucked a
borrowed pair of fishermans boots beneath his arm and without saying
anything to his housekeeper walked down the lawn behind the parsonage
climbed the rail fence and cut across lots to the pine grove on the
bluff There he removed his shoes put on the boots wallowed through
the mealy yellow sand forming the slope of the bluff and came out on
the white beach and the inner edge of the flats Then he plashed on
bound out to where the fish weirs stood like webby fences in the
distance

It was a wonderful walk on a wonderful day The minister enjoyed every
minute of it Out here he could forget the petty trials of life the
Didamas and Elkanahs The wind blew his hat off and dropped it in a
shallow channel but he splashed to the rescue and laughed aloud as he
fished it out It was not much wetter than it had been that night of
the rain when he tried to lend his umbrella and didnt succeed This
reflection caused him to halt in his walk and look backward toward the
shore The brown roof of the old tavern was blushing red in the first
rays of the sun

A cart drawn by a plodding horse and with a single individual on its
high seat was moving out from behind the breakwater Some fisherman
driving out his weir probably

The sand of the outer bar was dimpled and mottled like watered silk by
the action of the waves It sloped gradually down to meet the miniature
breakers that rolled over and slid in ripples along its edge Ellery
wandered up and down picking up shells and sea clams and peering
through the nets of the nearest weir at the horsefoot crabs and squid
and flounders imprisoned in the pound There were a few bluefish there
also and a small school of mackerel

The minister had been on the bar a considerable time before he began to
think of returning to the shore He was hungry but was enjoying himself
too well to mind The flats were all his that morning Only the cart and
its driver were in sight and they were half a mile off He looked at
his watch sighed and reluctantly started to walk toward the town he
mustnt keep Mrs Coffins breakfast waiting TOO long

The first channel he came to was considerably deeper than when he forded
it on the way out He noticed this but only vaguely The next however
was so deep that the water splashed in at the top of one of his boots
He did notice that because though he was not wearing his best clothes
he was not anxious to wet his other ones The extent of his wardrobe
was in keeping with the size of his salary

And the third channel was so wide and deep that he saw at once it could
not be forded unless he was willing to plunge above his waist This
was provoking Now he realized that he had waited too long The tide had
been flowing for almost an hour it had flowed fast and as he should
have remembered having been told the principal channels were eight
feet deep before the highest flats were covered

He hurried along the edge looking for a shallower place but found
none At last he reached the point of the flat he was on and saw to
his dismay that here was the deepest spot yet a hole scoured out by a
current like a mill race Turning he saw creeping rapidly and steadily
together over the flat behind him two lines of foam one from each
channel His retreat was cut off

He was in for a wetting that was sure However there was no help for
it so he waded in The water filled his boots there it gurgled about
his hips and beyond as he could see it seemed to grow deeper and
deeper The current was surprisingly strong he found it difficult to
keep his footing in the soft sand It looked as though he must swim for
it and to swim in that tide would be no joke

Then from behind him came a hail He turned and saw moving toward him
through the shallow water now covering the flat beyond the next channel
the cart he had seen leave the shore by the packet wharf and later on
the outer bar The horse was jogging along miniature geysers spouting
beneath its hoofs The driver waved to him

Hold on mate he called Belay there Stay where you are Ill be
alongside in a shake Git dap January

Ellery waded back to meet this welcome arrival The horse plunged into
the next channel surged through it and emerged dripping The driver
pulled the animal into a walk

Say he cried Im cruisin your way better get aboard hadnt you
Theres kind of a heavy dew this mornin Whoa Bill

Bill or January stopped with apparent willingness The driver leaned
down and extended a hand The minister took it and was pulled up to the
seat

Whew he panted Im much obliged to you I guess you saved me from a
ducking if nothing worse

Yes was the answer I wouldnt wonder if I did This aint Saturday
night and twould be against Trumet principles to take a bath any other
time All taut are you Good enough then well get under way He
flapped the reins and added Glong Julius Caesar

The horse a sturdy sedate beast to whom all names seemed to be alike
picked up his feet and pounded them down again Showers of spray flew
about the heads of the pair on the seat

I aint so sure about that duckin commented the rescuer Hum I
guess likely well be out of soundins if we tackle that sink hole you
was undertakin to navigate Lets try it a little further down

Ellery looked his companion over

Well he observed with a smile from what Ive heard of you Captain
Hammond I rather guess you could navigate almost any water in this
locality and in all sorts of weather

The driver turned in surprise

So he exclaimed You know me do you Thats funny I was tryin to
locate you but I aint been able to You aint a Trumetite Ill bet on
that

Yes I am

Tut tut tut you dont tell me Say shipmate you hurt my pride I
did think there want a soul that ever trod sand in this village that I
couldnt name on sight and give the port they hailed from and the names
of their owners But youve got me on my beam ends And yet you knew
ME

Of course I did Everybody knows the man that brought the packet home

Nat Hammond sniffed impatiently

Umhm he grunted I callate everybody does and knows a lot more
about that foolishness than I do myself If ever a craft was steered
by guess and by godfrey twas that old hooker of Zachs tother night
WellHumph heres another piece of pilotin that bids fair to be a
mighty sight harder Heave ahead Hannibal hope youve got your web
feet with you

They had moved along the edge of the flat a short distance and now
turned into the channel The horse was wading above its knees soon the
water reached its belly and began to flow into the body of the cart

Pick up your feet shipmate commanded Nat You may get rheumatiz if
you dont Thisll be a treat for those sea clams back in that bucket
amidships Theyll think Ive repented and have decided to turn em
loose again They dont know how long Ive been countin on a seaclam
pie Ill fetch those clams ashore if I have to lug em with my teeth
Steady all hands were off the ways

The cart was afloat The horse finding wading more difficult than
swimming began to swim

Now Im skipper again sure enough remarked Hammond Aint gettin
seasick are you

The minister laughed

No he said

Good she keeps on a fairly even keel considerin her build THERE
she strikes Thatll do January you neednt try for a record voyage
Walkins more in your line than playin steamboat Were over the worst
of it now Say you and I didnt head for port any too soon did we

No I should say not I ought to have known better than to wait out
there so long Ive been warned about this tide I

Sshsh YOU ought to have known better What do you think of me Born
and brought up within sight and smell of this salt puddle and let myself
in for a scrape like this But it was so mighty fine off there on the
bar I couldnt bear to leave it I always said that goin to sea on
land would be the ideal way and now Ive tried it But you took bigger
chances than I did Are you a good swimmer

Not too good I hardly know what might have happened if you hadnt

Sshsh thats all right Always glad to pick up a derelict may be a
chance for salvage you know Heres the last channel and its an easy
one There now its plain sailin for dry ground

The old horse breathing heavily from his exertions trotted over the
stretch of yet uncovered flats and soon mounted the slope of the beach
The minister prepared to alight

Captain Hammond he said you havent asked me my name

No I seldom do moren once There have been times when ID just as
soon cruise without too big letters alongside my figurehead

Well my name is Ellery

Hey WHAT Oh ho ho ho

He rocked back and forth on the seat The ministers feelings were a bit
hurt though he tried not to show it

You mustnt mind my laughin explained Nat still chuckling It
aint at you Its just because I was wonderin what youd look like if
I should meet you and nowHo ho You see Mr Ellery Ive heard of
you same as you said youd heard of me

Ellery smiled but not too broadly

Yes he admitted I imagined you had

Yes seems to me dad mentioned your name once or twice As much as
that anyhow Wonder what hed say if he knew his son had been takin
you for a mornin ride

Probably that it would have been much better to have left me where you
found me

The captains jolly face grew serious

No no he protested Not so bad as that Dad wouldnt drown anybody
not even a Regular minister Hes a pretty squarebuilt old craft even
though his spiritual chart may be laid out different from yoursand
mine

From yours Why I supposed

Yes I know Well WHEN I go to meetin I generally go to the chapel
to please father But when it comes right down to a confession of faith
Im pretty broad in the beam Maybe Id be too broad even for you Mr
Ellery

The minister who had jumped to the ground looked up

Captain Hammond he said Im very glad indeed that I met you Not
alone because you helped me out of a bad scrape I realize how bad it
might have been and that

Shsh shh Nothin at all Dont be foolish

But Im glad too because Ive heard so many good things about you
that I was sure you must be worth knowing I hope you wont believe I
went to your fathers meeting with any

No no Jumpin Moses man I dont find fault with you for that I
understand I guess

Well if you dont mind the fact that I am what I am Id like to shake
hands with you

Nat reached down a big brown hand

Same here he said Always glad to shake with a chap as well
recommended as you are Yes indeed I mean it You see youve got a
friend thats a friend of mine and when she guarantees a man to be A
B Ill ship him without any more questions

Well then goodby I hope we shall meet again and often And I
certainly thank you for

Thats all right Maybe youll fish ME out of the drink some day you
never can tell So long Git dap Genral Scott

He drove off up the beach but before he turned the corner of the
nearest dune he called back over his shoulder

Say Mr Ellery if you think of it you might give my regards
totoerthe lady thats keepin house for you

Breakfast had waited nearly an hour when the minister reached home
Keziah also was waiting and evidently much relieved at his safe
arrival

Sakes alive she exclaimed as she met him at the back door Where in
the world have you been Mr Ellery Soakin wet again too

Ellery replied that he had been for a walk out to the bar He sat down
on the step to remove the borrowed boots A small rivulet of salt water
poured from each as he pulled them off

For a walk A swim you mean How could you get in up to your waist if
you just walked Did you fall down

No not exactly But I waited too long and the tide headed me off

Mercy on us you mustnt take chances on that tide If youd told me
you was goin Id have warned you to hurry back

Oh Ive been warned often enough It was my own fault as usual Im
not sure that I dont need a guardian

Humph well I aint sure either Was the channels very deep

Deep enough The fact is that I might have got into serious trouble if
I hadnt been picked up

He told briefly the story of his mornings adventure The housekeeper
listened with growing excitement

Heavens to Betsy she interrupted Was the channel you planned to
swim the one at the end of the flat by the longest weir leader

Yes

My soul theres been two men drowned in that very place at half tide
And they were good swimmers After this I shant dare let you out of my
sight

So Was it as risky as that Why Captain Hammond didnt tell me so I
must owe him more even than I thought

Yes I guess you do He wouldnt tell you though that aint his way
Deary me for what weve received let us be thankful And that reminds
me that biscuits ought to be et when theyre first made not after
theyve been dried up on the back of the stove forever and ever amen
Go on and change those wet things of yours and then well eat Tryin to
swim the main channel on the flood My soul and body

Captain Nat sent his regards to you Mrs Coffin said the minister
moving toward the stairs

Did hey was the housekeepers reply Want to know


CHAPTER VIII

IN WHICH THE PARSON AND MR PEPPER DECLARE THEIR INDEPENDENCE


That afternoon when dinner was over the Reverend John decided to make
a few duty calls The first of these he determined should be on the
Peppers Lavinia and her brother had called at the Parsonage several
times but as yet he had not paid them a visit It was not a ceremony
to which he looked forward with delight but it must be performed
Miss Pepper had hinted several times at sewing circle and after prayer
meeting of partiality and only stoppin in where they had fancy
curtains up to the windows So as it could not be put off longer
without causing trouble he determined to go through with it

The Pepper house was situated just off the main road on the lane leading
over the dunes to the ocean and the light It was a small building its
white paint dingy and storm beaten and its little fencedin front
yard dotted thickly with clumps of silverleaf saplings A sign nailed
crookedly on a post informed those seeking such information that within
was to be found Abishai G W Pepper Tax Collector Assessor Boots
and Shoes Repaired And beneath this was fastened a shingle with the
chalked notice Salt Hay for sale

The boot and shoe portion of the first sign was a relic of other days
Kyan had been a cobbler once but it is discouraging to wait three
or four weeks while the pair of boots one has left to be resoled are
forgotten in a corner Captain Zeb Mayos pointed comment I want my
shoe leather to wear while Im alive not to be laid out in after I die
of old age expressed the general feeling of the village and explained
why custom had left Mr Pepper and flown to the more enterprising
shoemaker at The Corners The tax collectorship might have followed
it but here Lavinia kept her brother up to the mark She went with
him on his rounds and it gave her opportunity to visit and afterwards
comment upon every family in town

The minister walked up the dusty lane lifted the Pepper gate and swung
it back on its one hinge shooed away the three or four languid and
discouragedlooking fowls that were taking a sun bath on the clamshell
walk and knocked at the front door No one coming in answer to the
knock he tried again Then he discovered a rusty bell pull and gave it
a sharp tug The knob came off in his hand and he hurriedly thrust it
back again into its place Evidently that bell was solely for ornament

He came to the conclusion that no one was at home and felt a guilty
sense of relief in consequence But his conscience would not let him
depart without another try so he clenched his fist and gave the cracked
door panel a series of tremendous thumps A thin black cat which had
evidently been asleep beneath the step burst from its concealment and
fled in frantic terror Then from somewhere in the rear of the house
came the sound of a human voice

Hi it called faintly Whoever you be dont bust that door down
Come round here

Ellery walked around the corner of the building The voice came again

Say it wailed why dont you answer Be you comin If youre a
peddler you neednt

Im not a peddler was the ministers amused reply

Oh aint ye All right Come along then

Ellery came along as far as the angle where the ell joined the main
body of the house So far as he could see every door and window was
closed and there were no signs of life However he stepped to the door
a greenpainted affair of boards and ventured another knock

Dont start that poundin again protested the voice Come round to
tother side where I be

So around went the Reverend John smiling broadly But even on tother
side there was no one to be seen And no door for that matter

Why exclaimed the voice if taint Mr Ellery How dye do Glad to
see you Mr Ellery Fine day aint it Here I be at this window

Sure enough one of the windows on this side of the house was raised
about six inches at the bottom the shade was up and peering beneath
the sash the minister discerned the expressive features of Abishai
Pepperor as much of those features as the size of the opening
permitted to be seen

Oh exclaimed the visitor is that you Mr Pepper Well Im glad to
see you at last You are rather hard to see even now

Kyan was plainly embarrassed He stammered as he answered

Yes he agreed II shouldnt wonder if I be How be you Pretty
smart

Yes thank you Im well

Erercome to call did you

Why yes that was my intention

Hum ErerLaviny shes gone over to Thankful Paynes She heard
that Thankfuls cousin up to Middleboro had diedpassed away I
meanand she thought shed run over and find out if Thankful was willed
anything She said shed be back pretty soon

Very well Then as she wont be gone long perhaps Ill come in and
wait

He was moving away toward the corner when a shout from beneath the
window sash brought him to a halt

Hi called Abishai Hi Mr Ellery dont go to that door Taint no
use its locked

Locked Well you can unlock it cant you

No not very well That is IMr Ellery come back here wont ye I
dont want anybody to hear

The house of the nearest neighbor being several hundred yards away
the likelihood of being overheard was improbable but the minister came
back nevertheless

You see Mr Ellery stammered Kyan IId like to have you come in
fust rate buterLaviny shes got the key

Ellery was surprised

She has he exclaimed

Umhm shes got it She took it with her

But there are other doors She didnt take them all did she

Noo butWell the fact is Mr Ellery IIIm locked in

Locked in

Yes locked in this room ShesheOh consarn it all Mr Ellery
shes locked me in this room apurpose sos I wont get out and go
somewheres without her knowin it

What

Umhm thats what shes done Did you ever hear of anything like
that in your born days

This surprising disclosure was funny enough but the tone of grieved
indignation in which Mr Pepper told of his imprisonment was funnier
still The minister coughed violently and looked the other way

She done it apurpose continued Kyan in a burst of confidence She
had me put one of them newfangled spring locks on the door of this room
tother day cause she said she was afraid of tramps and wanted some
place to shut herself up in if one of em come Andand after dinner
today she sent me in here for somethin and then slammed the door on
me Said she callated Id stay put till she got back from Thankfuls
She knew mighty well I couldnt get out of the window cause it wont
open no furthern tis now I want never so provoked in my life
Taint no way to treat your own brother lockin him up like a young
one now is it

Ellerys reply was not made immediately He had heard numerous stories
concerning this odd household some of which seemed too absurd for
belief But this performance was more ridiculous than anything he had
heard

Taint right is it Mr Ellery demanded Kyan

Why answered the caller chokingly IIit is rather unusual
thats a fact May I ask what youve done to

Done I aint done nothin Shes so darned scared some other womanll
get my money thatyou see a month or so ago IIwell she thought
I done somethin or was plannin to do somethin thatKeziah Coffin
never told you anything about me did she

No indeed What could Mrs Coffin tell me about you

All right Nothin nothin Only if she did taint so But I aint
goin to stand it no more Mr Ellery Bein shut up in a darned
oldexcuse my swearin I didnt mean to though I got reason enough
land knowsbein shut up in a room full of trunks and odds and ends is
goin too fur I never want to smell old clothes agin longs I live
Would you stand it if you was me Mr Ellery

Why of course I mustnt interfere in your family matters Mr Pepper
Perhaps Id better call some other time Good afternoon

Hold on hold on you aint answered me yet Youre a minister and I
go to your meetin house Tell me what youd do if you was me Would you
stand it

Ellery laughed aloud

No he said I suppose I shouldnt

I bet you wouldnt What would you do

I dont know Youre of age Mr Pepper and you must decide for
yourself I think I should declare my independence Really I must go
I

Dont be in such a hurry I want advice I need it And so furs
DECLARIN goes that dont do me no good She can declare more things in
a minute than I can think of in a week Tongue I never heardNo no
Never mind the declarin What would you DO Sposin you wanted to go
outdoor without havin her tagged to your coat tails howd you stop the
taggin

The absurdity of the affair was too much for the visitor He roared a
Ha ha that caused Abishai to wave a warning hand beneath the sash

Sshh sshh he hissed Folksll hear ye and Id be so ashamed if
they did that I wouldnt dast to show my head Cant show much of it
anyhow just now By gum Ill do somethin desperate II dunno as I
wont pizen her I

Hush hush you mustnt talk that way Im afraid you must be very
fascinating Mr Pepper If your sister is so very fearful of your
meeting other women it must be because she has good reason to fear

Stop your foolishness OhII ask your pardon Mr Ellery That
aint no way to talk to a minister But Im goin to go out when I want
to if I bust a hole through the clapboards I AINT fascinatin You ask
any womanexcept herif I be and see what they say Whatll I DO

Ha ha I dont know Im sure You might lock HER up I suppose just
for a change

Hey There was a sound from behind the pane as if the imprisoned one
had slapped his knee By gum I never thought of that Would you now
Mr Ellery Would you Sshh sshh somebodys comin Maybe its her
Run around to the door Mr Ellery quick And dont tell her Ive seen
you for mercy sakes Dont now will ye Please Run

The minister did not run but he walked briskly around the corner
Sure enough Lavinia was there just unlocking the door She expressed
herself as very glad to see the caller ushered him into the sitting
room and disappeared returning in another moment with her brother whom
she unblushingly said had been taking a nap Abishai did not contradict
her instead he merely looked apprehensively at the minister

The call was a short one Lavinia did seven eighths of the talking and
Ellery the rest Kyan was silent When the visit was over Miss Pepper
escorted her guest to the door and bade him a voluble goodby Over
her shoulder the minister saw Kyan making frantic signs to him
he interpreted the signals as a request for secrecy concerning the
interview by the window

Several times during the remainder of that week he surprised his
housekeeper by suddenly laughing aloud when there was apparently
nothing to laugh at He explained these outbursts by saying that he
had thought of something funny Keziah suggested that it must be mighty
funny to make him laugh in the middle of sermon writing

Ive heard sermons that were funny she said though they wasnt
intended to be but what Ive heard of yours aint that kind I wish
youd let me in on the joke I havent been feelin like laughin for
the last fortnit

She had been rather grave and preoccupied for her of late Bustling
and busy she always was never sitting down to rest as she called it
without a lap full of sewing The ministers clothes were mended and his
socks darned as they had not been since his mothers day And with
him at meal times or after supper in the sitting room she was always
cheerful and goodhumored But he had heard her sigh at her work and
once when she thought herself unobserved he saw her wipe her eyes with
her apron

No no she protested when he asked if anything had gone wrong Im
all right Got a little cold or somethin I guess thats all

She would not give any other explanation and absolutely refused to see
the doctor Ellery did not press the matter He believed the cold to
be but an excuse and wondered what the real trouble might be It seemed
to him to date from the evening of his chapel experience

He told no one not even her of Kyans confidential disclosure and
after some speculation as to whether or not there might be a sequel put
the whole ludicrous affair out of his mind He worked hard in his study
and at his pastoral duties and was conscious of a pleasant feeling that
he was gaining his peoples confidence and esteem

A week from the following Sunday he dined in state at the Danielss
table Captain Elkanah was gracious and condescending Annabel was more
than that She was dressed in her newest gown and was so very gushing
and affable that the minister felt rather embarrassed When after the
meal was over Captain Elkanah excused himself and went upstairs for
his Sabbath nap the embarrassment redoubled Miss Annabel spoke very
confidentially of her loneliness without congenial society of
how VERY much she did enjoy Mr Ellerys intellectual sermons and
especially what a treat it had been to have him as a guest

You must dine here every Sunday she said It will be no trouble at
all and if you say no I shall feel that it is because you dont want
to see meFATHER and me of course I mean

The minister didnt accept this pressing invitation on the other
hand he could not refuse it absolutely He did not like Miss Daniels
overmuch but she was the daughter of his leading parishioner and she
and her parent did seem to like him So he dodged the issue and said she
was very kind

He left the big house as soon as he could without giving offense and
started back toward the parsonage But the afternoon was so fine and the
early summer air so delightful that he changed his mind and jumping the
fence at the foot of Cannon Hill set off across the fields toward the
bluffs and the bay shore

The sun was low in the west as he entered the grove of pines on the
bluff The red light between the boughs made brilliant carpet patterns
on the thick pine needles and the smell was balsamy and sweet Between
the tree trunks he caught glimpses of the flats now partially covered
and they reminded him of his narrow escape and of Nat Hammond his
rescuer He had met the captain twice since then once at the store and
again on the main road and had chatted with him He liked him immensely
and wished he might count him as an intimate friend But intimacy
between a Regular clergyman and the son of the leader of the ComeOuters
was out of the question Partisans on both sides would shriek at the
idea

Thinking of the Hammond family reminded him of another member of it Not
that he needed to be reminded he had thought of her often enough since
she ran away from him in the rain that night And the picture in the
doorway was not one that he could forgetor wanted to If she were
not a ComeOuter he could meet her occasionally and they might become
friends She was a disconcerting young person who lacked proper respect
for one of his profession and laughed when she shouldntbut she was
interesting he admitted that

And then he saw her She was standing just at the outer edge of the
grove leaning against a tree and looking toward the sunset She wore a
simple white dress and her hat hung upon her shoulders by its ribbons
The rosy light edged the white gown with pink and the fringes of her
dark hair were crinkly lines of fire Her face was grave almost sad

John Ellery stood still with one foot uplifted for a step The girl
looked out over the water and he looked at her Then a crow one of
several whirling above the pines spied the intruder and screamed a
warning The minister was startled and stepped back A dead limb beneath
his foot cracked sharply Grace turned and saw him

Oh she cried Who is it

Ellery emerged from the shadow

Dont be frightened Miss Van Horne he said It iserI

This statement was neither brilliant nor original even as an
identification it lacked considerable

I repeated the girl Who Oh Why

The minister came forward

Good afternoon Miss Van Horne he stammered Im afraid I frightened
you

She was looking at him with a queer expression almost as if she
scarcely believed him real

I hope he began again She interrupted him

No she said confusedly you didnt frighten me I was a little
startled when I saw you there behind me It seemed so odd because I was
just thinkingNo I wasnt frightened What is there to be frightened
ofin Trumet

He had extended his hand but partially withdrew it not sure how even
such a perfunctory act of friendliness might be received She saved him
embarrassment by frankly offering her own

Not much thats a fact he said in answer to her question He
would have liked to ask what she had been thinking that made his sudden
appearance seem so odd

You came to see the sunset I suppose she said hurriedly as if to
head off a question So did I It is a beautiful evening for a walk
isnt it

She had said precisely the same thing on that other evening when they
stood in the middle of Hammonds Turnoff in the driving rain He
remembered it and so evidently did she for she colored slightly and
smiled

I mean it this time she said Im glad you didnt get cold from your
wetting the other day

Oh I wasnt very wet You wouldnt let me lend you the umbrella so I
had that to protect me on the way home

Not then I meant the other morning when NatCapn Hammondmet you
out on the flats He said you were wading the main channel and it was
over your boots

Over my boots Is that all he said Over my head would be the plain
truth To cross it I should have had to swim and if what Ive heard
since is true I doubt if I could swim that channel Captain Hammond
helped me out of a bad scrape

Oh no I guess not He said you were cruising without a pilot and he
towed you into port thats the way he expressed it

It was worse than that a good deal worse It might have been my last
cruise Im pretty certain that I owe the captain my life

She looked at him uncomprehendingly

Your life she repeated

I believe it That part of the channel I proposed swimming was exactly
where two men have been drowned so people say Im not a very strong
swimmer and they were So you see

Grace cried out in astonishment

Oh she exclaimed Then pointing toward the bay she asked Out
there by the end of that leader was it

Yes that was it

She drew a long breath Then after a moment

And Nat spoke as if it was all a joke she said

No doubt he did From what I hear of your brother he generally refers
to his own plucky capable actions as jokes Other people call them
something else

She did not answer but continued to gaze at the halfsubmerged
leader with the pine bough tied at its landward end to mark the edge
of deep water and the tide foaming through its lath gratings

Your brother went on the minister

He isnt my brother she interrupted absently I wish he was

She sighed as she uttered the last sentence

No of course he isnt your real brother I forgot But he must seem
like one

Yes rather doubtfully

You must be proud of him

I am There was nothing doubtful this time

Well he saved me from drowning Im almost certain of that

Im so glad

She seemed to mean it He looked at her

Thank you he said drily Im rather glad myself

Oh I didnt mean it exactly that way Of course Im glad you werent
drowned but Im especially glad thatthat one of our family saved you
Now you wont believe that ComeOuters are all bad

I never believed it

She shook her head

Oh yes you did she affirmed stubbornly Youve heard nothing good
of us since you came here Dont tell fibs Mr Ellery

But I assure you

Nonsense Doeswell does Capn Daniels or his daughter say anything
good of us Be honest do they

I hardly thinkthat is I shouldnt call their opinions unprejudiced
And Miss Van Horne perhaps the prejudice isnt all on one side What
did your uncle say about Capn Nats meeting me the other day

Uncle Eben doesnt know Nat didnt tell anyone but me He doesnt
boast And uncle would be glad he helped you As I told you before Mr
Ellery Im not ashamed of my uncle He has been so good to me that I
never can repay him never When my own father was drowned he took me
in a little orphan that would probably have been sent to a home and
no father could be kinder or more indulgent than he has been Anything
I asked for I got and at last I learned not to ask for too much No
selfdenial on his part was too great if he could please me When he
needed money most he said nothing to me but insisted that I should be
educated I didnt know until afterwards of the selfsacrifice my four
years at the Middleboro Academy meant to him

The minister had listened eagerly to this defense of the man whom he had
been led to consider his arch enemy It was given with spirit and the
girls head was uplifted and her eyes flashed as she spoke Ellerys
next remark was uttered without premeditation Really he was thinking
aloud

So you went away to school he mused That is why

That is why I dont say never done nothin and be you and
haint neither Yes thank you thats why I dont wonder you were
surprised

The young man blushed

You misunderstand me he protested I didnt mean

Oh yes you did Not precisely that perhaps but pretty near it I
suppose you expected me to speak like Josiah Badger or Kyan Pepper I
try not to And I try not to say immejitly too she added with a
mischievous twinkle

Ellery recognized the immejitly quotation and laughed

I never heard but one person say that he observed And he isnt a
ComeOuter

No he isnt Well this lesson in English cant be very interesting
to you Mr Ellery and I must go But Im very glad Nat helped you the
other day and that you realize the sort of man he is And Im glad I
have had the opportunity to tell you more about Uncle Eben I owe him
so much that I ought to be gladyes glad and proud and happy too to
gratify his least wish I must I know I must no matter how IWhat
am I talking about Yes Mr Ellery Im glad if I have helped you to
understand my uncle better and why I love and respect him If you knew
him as I do you would respect him too Goodby

She was going but the minister had something to say He stepped forward
and walked beside her

Just a minute please he urged Miss Van Horne I do understand I
do respect your uncle We have a mutual friend you and I and through
her I have come to understand many things

Grace turned and looked at him

A mutual friend she repeated Oh I know Mrs Coffin

Yes Mrs Coffin Shes a good woman and a wise one

Shes a dear Do you like her too

Indeed I do

Has she told you about meabout uncle I mean

Yes Why she told me

He began to enumerate some of the things Keziah had told concerning the
Hammond family They were all good things and he couldnt help seeing
that the recital pleased her So he went on to tell how his housekeeper
had helped him of her advice of her many acts of kindness of what
he owed to her The girl listened eagerly asking questions nodding
confirmation and in her delight at hearing Keziah praised quite
forgetting her previous eagerness to end the interview And as he
talked he looked at her at the red light on her hair the shine of
her eyes like phosphorus in the curl of a wave at night at her long
lashes and

Yes said Miss Van Horne you were saying

The minister awoke with a guilty start He realized that his sentence
had broken off in the middle

Why whyeryes he stammered I was saying thatthat I dont know
what I should have done without Mrs Coffin Shes a treasure Frankly
she is the only real friend I have found in Trumet

I know I feel the same way about her She means so much to me I love
her more than anyone else in the world except uncle of courseand
Nat I miss her very much sincesince

Since I came you mean Im sorry I wishI hate to think I am the
cause which separates you two It isnt my fault as you know

Oh I know that

Yes and I object to having others choose my friends for me people
who because of a fanatical prejudice stand in the way ofIf it wasnt
for that you might call and see Mrs Coffin just as you used to do

Grace shook her head They had moved on to the bend of the bluff beyond
the fringe of pines and were now standing at the very edge of the high
bank

If it wasnt for that you would come asserted the minister

Yes I suppose so I should like to come I miss my talks with Aunt
Keziah more than you can imaginenow especially But somehow what we
want to do most seems to be what we mustnt and what we dont like is
our duty

She said this without looking at him and the expression on her face was
the same sad grave one he had noticed when he first saw her standing
alone by the pine

Why dont you come he persisted

I cant of course You know I cant

Why not If my company is objectionable I can go away when you come If
you dislike me I

You know I dont dislike you personally

Im awfully glad of that

But its impossible Uncle respects and is fond of Aunt Keziah but he
wouldnt hear of my visiting the parsonage

But dont you think your uncle might be persuaded Im sure he
misunderstands me just as I should him if it werent for Mrs
Coffinand what youve said Dont you think if I called on him and he
knew me better it might help matters Ill do it gladly I will

No no He wouldnt listen And think of your own congregation

Confound my congregation

Why Mr Ellery

She looked at him in amazement then her lips began to curl

Why Mr Ellery she repeated

The minister turned very red and drew his hand across his forehead

II dont mean that exactly he stammered But Im not a child I
have the right to exercise a mans discretion My parish committee must
understand that They shall If I choose to see youLook out

She was close to the overhanging edge of the bluff and the sod upon
which she stood was bending beneath her feet He sprang forward caught
her about the waist and pulled her back The sod broke and rattled down
the sandy slope She would have had a slight tumble nothing worse had
she gone with it There was no danger and yet the minister was very
white as he released her

She too was pale for a moment and then crimson

Thank you she gasped II must go It is late I didnt realize how
late it was II must go

He did not answer though he tried to

I must go she said hurriedly speaking at random Good afternoon
Goodby I hope you will enjoy your walk

I have enjoyed it His answer was unstudied but emphatic She
recognized the emphasis

Will you come to see Mrs Coffin he asked

No no You know I cant Goodby The sunset is beautiful isnt it

Beautiful indeed

Yes II think the sunsets from this point are the finest I have ever
seen I come here every Sunday afternoon to see them

This remark was given merely to cover embarrassment but it had an
unexpected effect

You DO cried the minister The next moment he was alone Grace Van
Horne had vanished in the gloom of the pine thickets

It was a strange John Ellery who walked slowly back along the path one
that Keziah herself would not have recognized to say nothing of
Captain Elkanah and the parish committee The dignified parson with
the dignified walk and calm untroubled brow was gone and here was
an absentminded young fellow who stumbled blindly along tripping over
roots and dead limbs and caring nothing apparently for the damage to
his Sunday boots and trousers which might result from the stumbles He
saw nothing real and heard nothing not even the excited person who
hidden behind the bayberry bush hailed him as he passed It was not
until this person rushed forth and seized him by the arm that he came
back to the unimportant affairs of this material earth

Why Why Mr Pepper he gasped Are you here What do you want

Am I here panted Kyan Aint I been here for the last twenty minutes
waitin to get a chance at you Aint I been chasin you from Dan
to Beersheby all this dummedexcuse meafternoon Oh my godfreys
mighty

Why whats the matter

Matter Matter enough Its all your fault You got me into the mess
now you git me out of it

Usually when Abishai addressed his clergyman it was in a tone of
humble respect far different from his present frantic assault The
Reverend John was astounded

handsII aint dast to go home sence WHATll I do


CHAPTER IX

IN WHICH MISS DANIELS DETERMINES TO FIND OUT


The hysterical Mr Pepper doubtless expected his clergyman to be almost
as much upset as he was by the news of his action But John Ellery was
provokingly calm As a matter of fact he scarcely grasped the purport of
the little mans disjointed story He had been wandering in dreamland
his head among the clouds and the explosion of Keziahs bomb disturbed
but did not clear the air

What will you do he repeated WhyerI dont know Im sure

Kyan was staggered

You dont know he shouted YOU dont Then who does for the land
sakes Didnt you tell me to lock her up Didnt I do it CAUSE you told
me Didntdidnt

He seemed to be on the verge of apoplexy Also he had raised his
voice to a yell The minister seized him by the arm and shook him into
silence

Hush hush he commanded Wait a minute Let me understand this
thing Some one is locked up you say Who is it Where

WHO is it Aint I tellin you Its Laviny She went into that spare
room where I was tother day and I slammed the spring lock to on her
Then I grabbed the key and run That was afore three this afternoon now
its most night and I aint dast to go home Whatll she say when I
let her out I got to let her out aint I She cant starve to death in
there can she And YOU told me to do it YOU did Oh

The apoplectic attack was once more imminent

Stop it Mr Pepper ordered Ellery I dont remember telling you
to lock your sister up thoughWhy yes I may have said something or
other as a joke but I didnt expect you would seriously consider doing
such a thing Ha ha This is the most idiotic piece of business that I
ever

Be you laughin demanded the shocked Abishai LAUGHIN Why my
godfreys mighty Idiotic Well whos the idiot Taint me ID never
have thought of such a fool trick But you said

Hush Let me think Have you told anybody

TOLD anybody I guess NOT And nobodyll never know if they wait for me
to tell em

Well then I dont see why you cant go home andhumI dont like
to advise your telling a lie but you might let her infer that it was an
accident OR if you really mean to be your own master you can tell her
you did it purposely and will do it again if she ever tries the trick on
you

I tell her that I tell her O Mr Ellery DONT talk so You dont
know Laviny she aint like most women If I should tell her that
shedI dont knows she wouldnt take and horsewhip me Or commit
suicide Shes said she would afore now ifif

Nonsense She wont do that you neednt worry He burst into another
laugh but checked himself as he saw the look of absolute distress on
poor Kyans face

Never mind Mr Pepper he said Well think of some plan to smooth
matters over Ill go home with you now and well let her out together

Will you Mr Ellery Will you honest Say by godfreys mighty Id
get down on my knees and thank you this minute ifif I want in such a
hurry Come right on come quick

It was a silent procession of two that wended its way out of the pines
and across the fields by the brook and the pond where the evening
mists were rising and the frogs chanting their goodnight song
through the gathering twilight shades across the main road and up the
lighthouse lane Kyan his mind filled with fearful forebodings was
busily trying to think of a reasonable excuse for the accidental
imprisonment of his sister John Ellery was thinking also but his
thoughts were not of the Peppers

The little house was dark and still as they approached it No welcoming
light in the diningroom windows no open door no shrill voice
demanding to know where the wandering brother had been all this
everlastin time Even the hens had gone to roost Abishai groaned

Oh dear he wailed Im scart to death Where is she You dont
callate shes done it do ye

Done it Done what

Done the suicidin She said she would ifO Laviny

Hush Be quiet Shes all right Shes in the room where you left her
of course She couldnt get out could she Youve got the key Come
in

They entered the house The dining room was dark and quiet So was the
sitting room The clock ticked solemn and slow Kyan clutched at his
companions arm

I dont hear her he whispered You dont spose she HAS done it
Godfreys mighty

The gloom and mystery were having their effect even on Mr Ellerys
nerves His answer also was given in a tense whisper but with some
irritation

Hush he murmured Let go of my wrist Youve pinched it black and
blue Which room did you leave her in Show me at once

Kyans trembling knees managed to carry him to the little hall leading
from the sitting room toward the ell at the side of the house This hall
was almost pitch black The minister felt his guides chin whisker brush
his ear as the following sentence was literally breathed into it

Herehere tis panted Kyan Heres the door I dont hear nothin
do you Listen

They listened Not a sound save the dismal tick of the clock in the
room they had left Ellery knocked on the door

Miss Pepper he said Miss Pepper are you there

Kyan caught his breath No answer

Miss Pepper repeated the minister Miss Pepper

Silence absolute Abishai could stand it no longer He groaned and
collapsed on his knees

She has he moaned Shes done it and there aint nothin in there
but her remains Oh my soul

Ellery now rather frightened himself shook him violently

Be quiet you idiot he commanded We must go in Give me the key

After repeated orders and accompanying shakings Kyan produced a key
The minister snatched it from his trembling fingers felt for the
keyhole and threw the door open The little room was almost as dark as
the hall and quite as still There was a distinct smell of old clothes
and camphor

A match demanded Ellery Quick

I aint got none quavered Mr Pepper Theyre all in the box in the
settin room Oh my godfreys mighty Whatll I do What undertakerll I
have Solon Tripps the reglar one but Laviny and he had a row and
she said shed come back and hant me if I ever let him touch her
remaWhere you goin DONT LEAVE ME HERE

The minister was going after a match and said so In a moment he
returned with several One of these he lit The brimstone sputtered
burned blue and fragrant then burst into a yellow flame

The little room was empty

John Ellery drew a breath of relief Then he laughed

Humph he exclaimed Shes gone

GONE Why she aint nuther Where could she go

I dont know but she has gonesomewhere At any rate shes not
here

Kyan rose to his feet His alarm had changed to paralyzed astonishment

How could she go he repeated That window wont open moren six
inches Laviny aint what youd call fleshy but she never could squeeze
through that in this world And I locked the door cause I heard the
click IIIdo you blieve in spirits Mr Ellery

Nonsense Come into the sitting room light a lamp and lets talk it
over

The lamp was found and lighted at last Its radiance brightened the
dingy sitting room

Do you blieve in spirits repeated Kyan Ive heard yarns about
folks bein spirited away but I never took much stock in em And
he added with conviction twould take a pretty husky spirit to handle
Laviny if she had her mad up SheHush hear that

The sound of wheels was heard in the lane by the front gate A vehicle
stopped Then some one called a hurried good night Mr Peppers fear
returned

Its her he cried Shes been ahuntin for me NOW Ill get it
You stand by me Mr Ellery You got to You said you would But how on
earth did she get

The minister motioned him to silence

Ill stand by you he whispered Dont speak Leave it to me

A step sounded on the back step The diningroom door was hurriedly
thrown open

Bishy called Miss Pepper eagerly Bish where are you

Herehere I be Laviny faltered Kyan

His sister appeared on the threshold She was dressed in her Sunday
best flowered poke bonnet mitts imitation India shawl rustling black
bombazine gown She looked at Mr Pepper then at the minister

O Mr Ellery she exclaimed be you here

The Reverend John admitted his presence Miss Peppers demeanor
surprised him She did not seem angry indeed she acted embarrassed and
confused as if she and not her brother were the guilty party

Im afraid Im awful late Bishy she said Have you had your
supper

Kyan was too perturbed to venture a reply The sword above his head was
quivering on its single hair and he was preparing to dodge the fall But
it did not fall

You havent had any supper have you purred Miss Pepper pityingly
Its too bad You poor thing you must be awful hungry

She moved across the room and kissed him Abishai who had prepared
himself for a different sort of greeting clutched his chair with both
hands He looked as if he might faint The minister gazed openmouthed

Im awful sorry Mr Ellery gushed Lavinia removing the bonnet You
see I was invited out to ride this afternoon andandI went

She glanced at her brother reddenedyes almost blushedand
continued

You know Bishy she said Thankful Paynes cousins home avisitin
her He come about that cousins willthe other cousin thats just
died Hes a reel nice manher live cousin iskeeps a shoe store up
to Sandwich and I used to know him years ago When I was over to
Thankfuls tother day him and me had quite a talk We got speakin of
what nice drives there was around Trumet andanderwell he asked me
if I wouldnt like to go to ride next Sunday afternoonthats today
And a ride bein a good deal of a treat to me I said I would Thankful
was goin too buterershe couldnt very well So Calebthats
his name you remember Bishyhe come round with his horse and team
about haf past three and we started But Id no IDEE twas so late
IImeant to tell you I was goin Bish but I forgot

Kyan had listened to this recital or explanation or apology with a
curious succession of expressions passing over his face He swallowed
two or three times but did not interrupt

Im so sorry I kept you waitin supper gushed Lavinia Ill get you
a good one now Oh well deary me I must be gettin absentminded I
aint asked you where youve been all the afternoon

Abishais eyes turned beseechingly toward his promised backer Ellery
could not resist that mute appeal

Your brother has been with me for some time Miss Pepper he
volunteered

Oh has he Aint that nice He couldnt have been in better compny
Im sure But oh say Bishy I aint told you how nigh I come to not
gettin out at all Just afore Mr Payne come I was in that spare room
andyou remember I put a spring lock on that door

It was here at last The longdreaded explosion was imminent Kyans
chin shook He braced himself for the blow The minister prepared to
come to the rescue

Yes went on Lavinia II put a lock on that door sos II could
shut the room up when I wanted to Well when I was in there this
afternoon the wind blew the door shut andHey

II never said nothin panted Kyan

Yes it blew to the lock clicked and there I was If I hadnt had the
other key in my pocket I dont knows I wouldnt have been in there yet
That would have been a pretty mess wouldnt it He he he

She laughed shrilly The minister looked at her then at her brother
and he too burst into a shout of laughter Kyan did not laugh yet his
grip upon the chair relaxed and over his countenance was spreading a
look of relief of hope and peace like a clear sunrise after a stormy
night

Well I must go and get supper declared Lavinia Youll forgive me
for leavin you so wont you Bishy

Mr Pepper sighed

Yes he said slowly Ill forgive you Laviny

I knew you would I hope you aint been too lonesome Did you miss me
Was you worried

Hey Yes II missed you considerble I WAS gettin sort of worried
I didnt spose youd go off to ride withwith a feller and leave me
all alone But I forgive you He stopped drew his hand across his
forehead and then added I spose I hadnt ought to complain Maybe
Id better get used to it I guess likely this is only the beginnin

Lavinia blushed furiously

Why Bish she exclaimed How you do talk Aint he awful Mr
Ellery

The Reverend John did not answer He could not trust himself to speak
just then When he did it was to announce that he must be getting toward
home No he couldnt stay for supper

Miss Pepper went into the kitchen and Abishai saw the visitor to the
door Ellery extended his hand and Kyan shook it with enthusiasm

Want it fine he whispered Talk about your miracles Godfreys
mighty Say Mr Ellery dont you ever tell a soul how it really was
will you

No of course not

No I know you wont You wont tell on me and I wont tell on you
Thats a trade hey

The minister stopped in the middle of his step

What he said turning

Mr Pepper merely smiled winked and shut the door John Ellery
reflected much during his homeward walk


The summer in Trumet drowsed on as Trumet summers did in those days
when there were no boarders from the city no automobiles or telephones
or antique collectors In June the Sunday school had its annual
picnic On the morning of the Fourth of July some desperate spirits
among the younger set climbed in at the church window and rang the bell
in spite of the warning threats of the selectmen who had gone on record
as prepared to prosecute all disturbers of the peace to the full extent
of the law One of the leading citizens his name was Daniels awoke to
find the sleigh which had been stored in his carriage house hoisted to
the roof of his barn and a section of his front fence tastefully draped
about it like a garland The widow Rogers noticed groups of people
looking up at her house and laughing Coming out to see what they were
laughing at she was provoked beyond measure to find a sign over the
front door announcing Man Wanted Imediate Inquire Within The door
of the ComeOuter chapel was nailed fast and Captain Zeb Mayos old
white horse wandered loose along the main road ringed with painted black
stripes like a zebra Captain Zeb was an angry man for he venerated
that horse

The storm caused by these outbreaks subsided and Trumet settled into
its jog trot The stages rattled through daily the packet came and went
every little while occasionally a captain returned home from a long
voyage and another left for one equally long Old Mrs Prince up at
the west end of the town was very anxious concerning her son whose
ship was overdue at Calcutta and had not been heard from The minister
went often to see her and tried to console but what consolation is
there when ones only child and sole support is nobody knows where
drowned and dead perhaps perhaps a castaway on a desert island or
adrift with a desperate crew in an open boat And Mrs Prince would say
over and over again

Yes yes Mr Ellery Thank you Im sure you mean to encourage me but
oh you dont know the things that happen to seafarin men I do I went
to sea with my husband for fourteen year He died on a voyage and they
buried him over the vessels side I cant even go to his grave The sea
got him and now if its taken my Eddie

The young clergyman came away from these calls feeling very young
indeed and woefully inadequate What DID he know of the great sorrows
of life

The Sunday dinners with the Daniels family were almost regular weekly
functions now He dodged them when he could but he could not do so
often without telling an absolute lie and this he would not do And
regularly when the solemn meal was eaten Captain Elkanah went upstairs
for his nap and the Reverend John was left alone with Annabel Miss
Daniels did her best to be entertaining was in fact embarrassingly
confidential and cordial It was hard work to get away and yet somehow
or other at the stroke of four the minister always said goodby and
took his departure

What is your hurry Mr Ellery begged Annabel on one occasion when
the reading of Moores poems had been interrupted in the middle by the
guests sudden rising and reaching for his hat I dont see why you
always go so early Its so every time youre here Do you call at any
other house on Sunday afternoons

No was the prompt reply Oh no

Then why cant you stay You know Ithat is pa and Iwould LOVE to
have you

Thank you Thank you Youre very kind But I really must go Good
afternoon Miss Daniels

Mrs Rogers said she saw you going across the fields after you left
here last Sunday Did you go for a walk

Ereryes I did

I wish you had mentioned it I love to walk and there are SO few
people that I find congenial company Are you going for a walk now

Why noernot exactly

Im sorry GOODby Will you come again next Sunday Of COURSE you
will You know how dreadfully disappointed Iweshall be if you
dont

Thank you Miss Daniels I enjoyed the dinner very much Good
afternoon

He hurried down the path Annabel watched him go Then she did an odd
thing She passed through the sitting room entered the front hall went
up the stairs tiptoed by the door of her fathers room and then up
another flight to the attic From here a steep set of steps led to the
cupola on the roof In that cupola was a spyglass

Annabel opened a window a few inches took the spyglass from its rack
adjusted it laid it on the sill of the open window and knelt the glass
at her eye The floor of the cupola was very dusty and she was wearing
her newest and best gown but she did not seem to mind

Through the glass she saw the long slope of Cannon Hill with the beacon
at the top and Captain Mayos house near it The main road was deserted
save for one figure that of her late caller He was mounting the hill
in long strides

She watched him gain the crest and pass over it out of sight Then she
shifted the glass so that it pointed toward the spot beyond the curve
of the hill where the top of a thick group of silverleafs hid the
parsonage Above the tree tops glistened the white steeple of the
Regular church If the minister went straight home she could not see
him But under those silverleafs was the beginning of the short cut
across the fields where Didama had seen Mr Ellery walking on the
previous Sunday

So Annabel watched and waited Five minutes then ten He must have
reached the clump of trees before this yet she could not see him
Evidently he had gone straight home She drew a breath of relief

Then being in a happier frame of mind and the afternoon clear and
beautiful she moved the glass along the horizon watching the distant
white specks across the bay on the Wellmouth bluffshouses and
buildings they werethe water the shore the fish weirs the pine
groves She became interested in a sloop beating into Wellmouth harbor
and watched that After a time she heard in the house below her father
shouting her name

She gave the glass one more comprehensive sweep preparatory to closing
it and going downstairs As she did this a moving speck came into view
and vanished

Slowly she moved the big end of the spyglass back along the arc it had
traveled She found the speck and watched it It was a man striding
across the meadow land a half mile beyond the parsonage and hurrying
in the direction of the beach She saw him climb a high dune jump a
fence cross another field and finally vanish in the grove of pines on
the edge of the bluff by the shore

The man was John Ellery the minister Evidently he had not gone home
nor had he taken the short cut Instead he had walked downtown a long
way and THEN turned in to cross the fields and work his way back

Annabel put down the glass and heedless of her fathers calls sat
thinking The minister had deliberately deceived her More than that he
had gone to considerable trouble to avoid observation Why had he done
it Had he done the same thing on other Sunday afternoons Was there
any real reason why he insisted on leaving the house regularly at four
oclock

Annabel did not know Her eyes snapped and her sharp features looked
sharper yet as she descended the steps to the attic She did not know
but she intended to find out


CHAPTER X

IN WHICH KEZIAHS TROUBLES MULTIPLY


Keziah was getting worried about her parson Not concerning his
popularity with his congregation She had long since ceased to worry
about that The young ministers place in his peoples regard was now
assured the attendance was increasing and the Regular church was
now on a firmer footing financially and socially than it had been
in years Even Mrs Rogers and Lavinia Pepper had ceased to criticise
except as pertained to unimportant incidentals and were now among the
loudest of the praise chanters And as Captain Zeb Mayo said When
Didama and Laviny stops faultfindin the millenniums so nigh port a
feller ought to be overhaulin his saint uniform

But what worried Mrs Coffin was John Ellerys personal appearance and
behavior He had grown perceptibly thinner during the past month his
manner was distrait and worst of all in the housekeepers eyes his
appetite had fallen off She tried all sorts of tempting dishes but the
result was discouraging

What she exclaimed Dont want but one piece of huckleberry pie
Why a week ago you ate three and looked kind of disappointed cause the
dish was empty What is the matter Are you sick

No Mrs Coffin replied the Reverend John No Im not sick I just
dont feel hungry thats all

Hum Well Ive usually noticed that when a healthy man dont feel
hungry at dinner time specially in the huckleberry season his
healthiness is pretty shaky What does ail you Mr Ellery Got
somethin on your mind If you have Id heave it overboard Or you
might unload it onto me and let me prescribe Ive had considerble
experience in that kind of doctorin

But the answer was unsatisfactory Mr Ellery laughed changed the
subject and wandered out into the garden where Keziah saw him shortly
afterwards intently regarding nothing in particular with a rapt stare
She watched him for a few moments and then with a puzzled shake of
the head returned to her work She believed that he was troubled about
something and was herself troubled in consequence

His absentmindedness was most acute on Sunday evenings before prayer
meeting and after he had returned from the afternoon at Captain
Elkanahs

Say Mr Ellery she said on one of these Sunday evenings do you
know it seems to me that Elkanahs meals must go to your head Dont
have any of his granddads New England rum do you They tell me hes
got some of that down cellar that he doles out occasional to his
very particular friends Thats the common yarn around town though I
couldnt swear twas gospel

The minister smiled and denied acquaintanceship with the New England
beverage

Humph Then it must be the other thing You aint in love are you

The young man started colored and was plainly embarrassed

In love he repeated In love Mrs Coffin

Yes in love Annabel hasnt landed a male at last has she Shes a
line over the side for a long time

The hearty laugh with which this was received settled the question of
Annabels success Keziah was relieved

Well Im glad of that she said I aint got any grudge against
Annabel but neither have I got one against you Another man in that
family would have an easy time in one way he wouldnt have to do any
thinkin for himselfElkanah and his daughter would do all that was
necessary So youre not in love Then I dont know what does ail you
Ill say this though for a body that aint in love you certainly stay
with the Danielses a long time You went there right after meetin this
noon and now its seven oclock and youve just got home And twas the
same last Sunday and the one before Been there all the time have you

She knew he had not because she had seen him pass the parsonage on
the opposite side of the road two hours before But she was curious to
learn what his reply would be It was noncommittal

No he said slowly Not all the time Ierwent for a short walk

Before she could inquire concerning that walk he had entered the study
and closed the door after him

During the week which followed this particular conversation he was more
absentminded than ever There were evenings when he spoke scarcely a
word but sat silent in his chair while Keziah looking up from her
mending watched him and guessed and wondered After he had gone to his
room for the night she would hear him pacing the floor back and forth
back and forth She asked no more questions however minding her own
business was a specialty of Keziahs and it was a rare quality in
Trumet

Sunday was a cloudy warm day muggy so Captain Zeb described it
After the morning service Mr Ellery as usual went home with Captain
Daniels and Annabel Keziah returned to the parsonage ate a lonely
dinner washed the dishes and sat down to read a library book She
read for an hour and then finding it difficult to keep her mind on the
story gave it up closed the book and rising walked to the window
But the misty hot loneliness of the afternoon was neither interesting
nor cheerful so she turned away and went upstairs to her own room Her
trunk was in one corner of this room and she unlocked it taking from
a compartment of the tray a rosewood writing case inlaid with
motherofpearl a present from her father who had brought it home from
sea when she was a girl

From the case she took a packet of letters and a daguerreotype The
latter was the portrait of a young man in highcollared coat stock
and fancy waistcoat His hair worn long over the ears was smooth with
a shine that suggested oil and in his shirt front was a large pin
which might possibly have been mistaken by a credulous observer for a
diamond Mrs Coffin looked at the daguerreotype sighed shuddered and
laid it aside Then she opened the packet of letters Selecting one from
the top of the pile she read it slowly And as she read she sighed
again

She did not hear the back door of the parsonage open and close softly
Nor did she hear the cautious footsteps in the rooms below What aroused
her from her reading was her own name spoken at the foot of the stairs

Keziah Keziah are you there

She started sprang up and ran out into the hall the letter still in
her hand

Who is it she asked sharply Mr Ellery is that you

No was the answer Its meNat Are you busy Keziah I want to see
you for a minute

The housekeeper hurriedly thrust the letter into her waist

Ill be right down Nat she answered Im comin

He was in the sitting room when she entered He was wearing his Sunday
suit of blue and his soft felt hat was on the center table She held out
her hand and he shook it heartily

Well she observed smiling I declare if I dont believe youve got
the tiptoe habit This is the second time youve sneaked into the house
and scared me most to death I asked you before if you want ashamed
of yourself and now I ask it again

Before he could reply she caught a glimpse of his face

What is it she asked What is the matter Is anybody sick Is your
father

No hes all right That is hes as well as he has been lately though
that isnt sayin much

Is Grace

No shes all right too I guess Been sort of quiet and sorrowful
for the last few weeksor Ive seemed to notice that she hasbut
I callate its nothin serious I wouldnt wonder if the same thing
thats troublin her is what ails me

But what is it Why dont you tell me

Im goin to tell you Keziah Thats what I come here for I

Sit down cant you Dont stand up there like a lighthouse shuttin
out the whole broadside of the room You are the BIGGEST thing

Captain Hammond selected the most substantial chair in the apartment and
sat down upon it He looked at his friend and shook his head

No use Keziah he said If I was as deep down in the blues as the
bottom of the Whale Deep a look at that face of yours would pull me to
the top again Youre a good woman

Thanks When I have spare time on my hands Ill practice tryin to
believe that But what is the trouble Nat Out with it

Well Keziah its trouble enough Dad and I have had a fallin out

Mrs Coffins mouth and eyes opened

What she cried in utter astonishment

Yes Its true We had what was next door to a real quarrel after
dinner today It would have been a real one if I hadnt walked off and
left him Hes as set as the rock of Gibraltar and

And your foundations aint given to slippin much Nat Hammond Im
surprised at you What was it all about Religion

No not a sliver of religion in it If twas that I could dodge or
haul down my colors if I had to But its somethin worse enough sight
worse Somethin I cant doeven for dadand wont either Keziah
hes dead set on my marryin Grace Says if I dont hell know that
I dont really care a tin nickel for him or for his wishes or what
becomes of the girl after hes gone

Nat

Its a fact You see dad realizes bettern I thought he did that his
health is pretty shaky and that he is likely to founder most any time
He says that dont worry him if he knew Grace and I were provided for
hed slip his cable with a clean manifest But the dream of his life he
says has been that we should marry And he wants to see it done

Keziah was silent for a moment Then she said slowly

And Grace herself How does she feel about it Has he spoken to her

I dont know I guess likely he has Perhaps thats why shes been so
sort of mournful lately But never mind whether he has or not I wont
do it and I told him so He got red hot in a jiffy I was ungrateful and
stubborn and all sorts of things And I bein a Hammond with some of
the Hammond balkiness in me I set my foot down as hard as his And we
had it untiluntilwell until I saw him stagger and tremble so that I
actually got scared and feared he was goin to keel over where he stood

Why cant you he kept sayin But WHY cant you Aint she a girl
anyone would be proud to have for a wife Course there was no answer
to that but yes Then back he comes again with Then why cant you At
last bein frightened as I said that he might have another shock or
somethin I said Id think it over and come away and left him And I
come straight to you Keziah what shall I do What can you say to help
me

Keziah was silent She was looking not at her companion but at the
carpet center of one of the braided rugs on the floor Her face was very
grave and the lines about her mouth seemed to deepen Her hands clasped
in her lap tightened one upon the other But her voice was calm when
at last she spoke

Nat she said theres only one thing I can say And thats what your
father said Why cant you

The captain sprang from his chair

What he cried incredulously What are you sayin

Just what your father said Nat Why cant you marry Grace Shes a
dear good girl and

That bekeelhauled Keziah Coffin you sit there and ask me why I
cant marry her YOU do

Yes Nat

Keziah youre crazy Dont talk to me like that Were not jokin now
You know why I cant marry her nor anyone else in this round world but
you

Nat I cant marry you

I know I know Youre always sayin that But you dont mean it You
cant mean it Why you and me have been picked out for each other by
the Almighty Keziah I swear I believe just that We went together when
we were boy and girl to parties and such We was promised when I first
went to sea If it hadnt been for that fool row we hadand twas all
my fault and I know ityou never would have let that dathat miserable
Anse Coffin come near you And when twas too late and youd married

Hush Nat hush Stop it

Never he repeated more to himself than to her

Never Yes Nat

Please Nat I can hardly believe this is you This trouble with your
father has upset you You dont mean what you say Youre not talkin
like yourself and

Stop it I tell you I dont feel like myself I banked on you Keziah
Ive lived for you And nowO Keziah take it back Give me a little
hope just enough to keep my head above water

Id like to Nat I only wish I could But twouldnt be any use I
cant do it

He snatched his hat from the table and strode to the door Turning he
looked at her

All right he said chokingly All right Goodby

His steps sounded on the oilcloth of the kitchen Then the back door
slammed He was gone

Keziah started as if the slam of the door had been an electric shock
During the interview she had been pale and grave but outwardly calm Now
she sank wearily down in the chair from which she had risen and her
head dropped forward upon her arms on the table The letter she had been
reading before Captain Nats arrival fell from her waist to the floor
and lay there its badly spelled and blotted lines showing black
and fateful against the white paper And she cried tears of utter
loneliness and despair

The clouds thickened as the afternoon passed The setting sun was
hidden behind them over the horizon of ocean and bay the fog banks were
rolling in tumbled crumpled masses The shadows in the lonely sitting
room deepened There came a knock at the diningroom door

Keziah sprang from her chair smoothed her hair hastily wiped her eyes
picked up the dropped letter and went to admit the visitor whoever he
or she might be She was glad of the shadows they prevented her face
from being seen too plainly

Good afternoon she said opening the door Oh its you is it

Yes admitted Abishai Pepper standing on the stone step and shifting
uneasily from one foot to the other Yes Keziah itsits me thank
you

Dont mention it Well is Laviny with you

Noo she aint Sheshe didnt come

Hum Did she know you was comin

Noo I dont callate she did

I see Well what do you want

Mrs Coffins welcome was not too cordial She had laughed many times
over Abishais proposal of marriage but she had never quite forgiven
him for making her ridiculous on that occasion Incidentally she did
not feel like laughing

What do you want she repeated

Kyan was plainly nervous

I only wanted to see Mr Ellery he announced Its all right
Keziah You neednt be afraid

Afraid What on earth should I be afraid of

Whywhy I didnt know but you might be afraid I was goin toto talk
about what we talked about when II talked to you that day up at

There thatll do It aint me that would have reason to be afraid if
THAT was what you come for What do you want Dont stand there dancin
a jig

I only wanted to see Mr Ellery

Hes out Good day

But I wont keep him but a minute

Hes out I tell you Do you want to leave a message

Noo No I guess not

Was it important

Oh I dont know Kind of maybe I wanted to ask his advice about
somethin Its a secret Only him and me know about it Goodby

Shall I tell him youll call again Or ask him to come up to your
house

Mr Pepper who had started to go now hurried back to the steps

No no he protested in alarm Dont you tell him that I wouldnt
have him come there for no money Why Laviny she

Oh Laviny isnt in the secret then Keziah smiled in spite of
herself

Not exactly That is not much Dont you tell her I come here will
you Ill find Mr Ellery I know where he is

I wouldnt go to the Danielses if I was you Elkanah might not like
to have you chasin after his visitors

Oh the minister aint at the Danielses not as lates this he aint
I know where he is

You do The housekeeper looked at him keenly

Yes sir I do I know where he goes Sunday afternoonsand why he
goes too Mr Ellery and mes good friends We understand each other

Look here Kyan Pepper What are you talkin about

Nothin nothin Good day

Stop Stand still Come in the house here I want you to

No no Keziah Really Id love to but I cant stop

Come in I tell you

Reluctantly but lacking the strength of mind to refuse Mr Pepper
entered the dining room Then Mrs Coffin turned upon him

What do you mean she demanded by throwin out hints that the
minister and you are in some sort of secret How dare you go round
tellin people such yarns as that

They aint yarns And I never told nobody afore anyhow I got to move
along Ill

Stay where you are I guess Ill run right up and ask your sister about
this Perhaps she might

Sssh sssh dont talk that way Keziah Dont Laviny dont know
what I mean Dont go askin HER things

But you said

I just said I knew where Mr Ellery goes every Sunday afternoon He
dont know anybody knows but I do Thats all there is to it I shant
tell So

Tell Do you mean theres somethin Mr Ellery wouldnt want told
Dont you dareI WILL see Laviny

No no no no Taint nothin much I just know where he goes after
he leaves Elkanahs and who he goes to meet ILordy I hadnt ought to
said that IKeziah Coffin dont you ever tell I told you Ive said
moren I meant to If it comes out thered be the biggest row in the
church that ever was And Id be responsible I would Id have to go
on the witness stand and then Lavinyd find out how IOh oh oh what
SHALL I do

The poor frightened creatures jig had by this time become a
distracted fandango But the housekeeper had no mercy on him She was
beginning to fear for her parson and for the time everything else her
own trouble and the recent interview with Nat was pushed aside

What is it she persisted WHAT would bring on the row in the church
WHO does Mr Ellery meet Out with it What do you mean

I mean that the minister meets that Van Horne girl every Sunday
afternoon after he leaves Elkanahs There now Its out and I dont
give a darn if they hang me for it

Keziah turned white She seized Mr Pepper by the lapel of his Sunday
coat and shook him

Grace Van Horne she cried Mr Ellery meets Grace Van Horne on
Sunday afternoons Where

Down in them pines back of Peterss pastur on the aidge of the
bank over the beach Hes met her there every Sunday for the last six
weekslonger for what I know Ive watched em

You HAVE YOU have Youve dared to spy onI think youre lyin to me
I dont believe it

I aint lyin Its so Ill bet you anything theyre there now
walkin up and down and talkin What would I want to lie for You come
with me this minute and Ill show em to you

In the desire to prove his veracity he was on his way to the door But
Keziah stepped in front of him

Bish Pepper she said slowly and fiercely shaking a forefinger in
his face you go straight home and stay there Dont you breathe a word
to a livin soul of what you say youve seen Dont you even think it
oror dream it If you do IllIll march straight to Laviny and tell
her that you asked me to marry you I will as sure as youre shakin in
front of me this minute Now you swear to me to keep still Swear

HowHOWll I swear begged Kyan What do you say when you swear
Ill say it Keziah Ill say anything Ill

All right Then mind you remember Now clear out quick I want to
think I MUST think GO Get out of my sight

Kyan went glad to escape but frightened to the soul of him Keziah
watched him until he turned from the main road into the lighthouse lane
Then certain that he really was going straight home she reentered
the parsonage and sat down in the nearest chair For ten minutes she sat
there striving to grasp the situation Then she rose and putting on
her bonnet and shawl locked the diningroom door and went out through
the kitchen On the step she looked cautiously back to see if any of the
neighbors were at their windows But this was Sunday the one day when
Trumet people sat in their front parlors The coast was clear She
hurried through the back yard and down the path leading across the
fields She was going to the pine grove by the shore going to find out
for herself if Kyans astonishing story was true

For if it was true if the Rev John Ellery was meeting clandestinely
the adopted daughter of Eben Hammond it meantwhat might it not mean
in Trumet If he had fallen in love with a ComeOuter with Grace Van
Horne of all people if he should dare think of marrying her it would
mean the utter wreck of his career as a Regular clergyman His own
society would turn him out instantly All sorts of things would be said
lies and scandal would be invented and believed His character would be
riddled by the Trumet gossips and the papers would publish the result
broadcast

And Grace If she loved a Regular minister what would happen to her
Captain Eben would turn her from his door that was certain Although
he idolized the girl Keziah knew that he would never countenance such
a marriage And if Nat stood by Grace as he would be almost sure to do
the breach between father and son would widen beyond healing If it were
merely a matter of personal selection Mrs Coffin would rather have
seen her parson marry Grace than anyone else on earth As it was such
a match must not be It meant ruin for both She must prevent the affair
going further She must break off the intimacy She must save those two
young people from making a mistake which wouldShe wrung her hands as
she thought of it Of her own sorrow and trouble she characteristically
thought nothing now Sacrifice of self was a part of Keziahs nature

The pines were a deepgreen blotch against the cloudy sky and the gloomy
waters of the bay She skirted the outlying clumps of bayberry and beach
plum bushes and entered the grove The pine needles made a soft carpet
which deadened her footfalls and the shadows beneath the boughs were
thick and black She tiptoed on until she reached the clearing by the
brink of the bluff No one was in sight She drew a breath of relief
Kyan might be mistaken after all

Then she heard low voices As she crouched at the edge of the grove two
figures passed slowly across the clearing along the bushbordered path
and into the shrubbery beyond John Ellery was walking with Grace
Van Horne He was holding her hand in his and they were talking very
earnestly

Keziah did not follow What would have been the use This was not the
time to speak She KNEW now and she knew also that the responsibility
was hers She must go home at once go home to be alone and to think
She tiptoed back through the grove and across the fields

Yet if she had waited she might have seen something else which would
have been at least interesting She had scarcely reached the outer
edge of the grove when another figure passed stealthily along that
narrow path by the bluff edge A female figure treading very carefully
rising to peer over the bushes at the minister and Grace The figure of
Miss Annabel Daniels the belle of Trumet And Annabels face was not
pleasant to look upon


CHAPTER XI

IN WHICH CAPTAIN EBEN RECEIVES A CALLER


At the edge of the bluff just where the pines and the bayberry bushes
were thickest where the narrow crooked little footpath dipped over the
rise and down to the pasture land and the salt meadow John Ellery
and Grace had halted in their walk It was full tide and the miniature
breakers plashed amid the seaweed on the beach The mist was drifting in
over the bay and the gulls were calling sleepily from their perch along
the breakwater A night hawk swooped and circled above the tall feather
grass by the margin of the creek The ministers face was pale but set
and determined and he was speaking rapidly

I cant help it he said I cant help it I have made up my mind and
nothing can change it nothing but you It rests with you If you say
yes then nothing else matters Will you say it

He was holding both her hands now and though she tried to withdraw
them he would not let her

Will you he pleaded

I cant she answered brokenly I cant Think of your church and of
your people What would they say if

I dont care what they say

Oh yes you do Not now perhaps but later you will You dont know
Trumet as I know it No its impossible

I tell you there is only one impossible thing That is that I give you
up I wont do it I CANT do it Grace this is life and death for me
My church

He paused in spite of himself His church his first church He had
accepted the call with pride and a determination to do his best the
very best that was in him for the society and for the people whom he
was to lead Some of those people he had learned to love many of them
he felt sure loved him His success his popularity the growth of the
organization and the praise which had come to him because of it all
these had meant and still meant very much to him No wonder he paused
but the pause was momentary

My church he went on is my work and I like it I believe Ive done
some good here and I hope to do more But no church shall say whom I
shall marry If you care for me Grace as I think and hope you do
well face the church and the town together and they will respect us
for it

She shook her head

Some of them might respect you she said They would say you had been
led into this by me and were not so much to blame But I

They shall respect my wife he interrupted snapping his teeth
together or Ill know the reason why

She smiled mournfully

I think theyll tell you the reason she answered No John no
we mustnt think of it You can see we mustnt This has all been a
mistake a dreadful mistake and I am to blame for it

The only mistake has been our meeting in this way We should have met
openly I realize it and have felt it for sometime It was my fault
not yours I was afraid I guess But Ill not be a coward any longer
Come dear lets not be afraid another day Only say youll marry me
and Ill proclaim it openly tonightYes from the pulpit if you say
so

She hesitated and he took courage from her hesitation

Say it he pleaded You WILL say it

I cant I cant My uncle

Your uncle shall hear it from me Well go to him together Ill tell
him myself He worships you

Yes I know He does worship me Thats why I am sure he had rather see
me dead than married to you a Regular and a Regular minister

I dont believe it He cant be so unreasonable If he is then you
shouldnt humor such bigotry

He has been my father for years and a dear kind father

I know Thats why Im so certain we can make him understand Come
dear come Why should you consider everyone else Consider your own
happiness Consider mine

She looked at him

I am considering yours she said That is what I consider most of
all And as for uncle I knowI KNOW he would never consent His heart
is set on something else Nat

Nat Are you considering him too Is HE to stand between us What
right has he to say

Hush hush He hasnt said anything Butbut he and uncle have
quarreled just a little I didnt tell you but they have And I think
I know the reason Nat is Uncle Ebens idol If the quarrel should grow
more serious I believe it would break his heart I couldnt bear to be
the cause of that I should never forgive myself

You the cause How could you be the cause of a quarrel between those
two Grace think of me

Here was the selfishness of man and the unselfishness of woman answered

John she said it is of you I am thinking Everything else
couldmight be overcome perhaps But I must think of your future and
your life I MUST That is why

He did not wait to hear more He seized her in his arms and kissed her

Then you DO care he cried joyfully You will marry me

For an instant she lay quiet in his embrace receiving if not
responding to his caresses Then she gently but firmly freed herself He
saw that there were tears in her eyes

Grace he urged dontdont hesitate any longer You were meant to
be my wife We were brought together for just that I know it Come

She was crying softly

Wont you he begged

I dont know she sobbed Oh I dont know I must thinkI MUST
Wait please wait John Perhaps by tomorrow I can answer Ill
tryIll try Dont ask me again now Let me think Oh do

Doubtless he would have asked her again He looked as if he meant to
But just then drifting through the twilight and the mist came the
sound of a bell the bell of the Regular church ringing for the Sunday
evening meeting They both heard it

Oh exclaimed Grace that is your bell You will be late You must
go and so must I Good night

She started down the path He hesitated then ran after her

Tomorrow he questioned eagerly Tomorrow then youll say that you
will

Oh perhaps perhaps I mustnt promise Good night

It was after seven when Grace reached the old tavern The housekeeper
Mrs Poundberry was anxiously awaiting her She wore her bonnet and
Sunday gown and was evidently ready to go out

Land sakes alive she sputtered Where in the name of goodness have
you been to I was gettin scairt Didnt know but youd run off and got
married or sunthin dreadful

Grace was thankful that the cloudy twilight made it impossible to see
her face distinctly The housekeeper rattled on without waiting for an
answer

Suppers on the table and the kittles abilin You better eat in a
hurry cause its meetin time now Your uncle he started ten minutes
ago Im agoin right along too but I aint goin to meetin Im
agoin up to Betsy Es to stay all night Shes got a spine in her
back as the feller said and aint feelin good so I told her Id come
and stay a little spell Spose you can get along tomorrow without me

Betsy E was Mrs Poundberrys second cousin an elderly spinster
living alone in a little house near the salt works Grace assured her
questioner that she could attend to the house and the meals during the
following day longer if the troublesome spine needed company Mrs
Poundberry sighed groaned and shook her head

I shant stay no longer she affirmed not if Betsys all over
spines like one of them Mexican cactus plants No marm my place is
right here and I know it Your Uncle Ebens mighty feeble and peaked
lately He aint long for this world Im afraid Youd ought to be
awful good to him Gracie

I know it was the hurried reply Wheres Nat

I dont know Cant keep track of HIM Mights well try to put your
finger on a flea Hes here today and gone yesterday as the Scriptur
says He ate a little mite of supper but not much and then off he
puts Says hes goin to walk the fog outn his head I told him s I
Youll walk a plaguey sight more in than you do out THIS night
but he went just the same He was dreadful kind of dumpy and blue this
evenin Seemed to be sort of soggy in his mind And why he never went
to meetin with his dad and why his dad never asked him TO go is moren
I can tell Land of livin how I do gabble My grandmarm used to say
my tongue was loose at both ends and hung in the middle and I guess she
want fur off the course Goodby Take care of yourself You can put
whats left of that mock mince pie on the top shelf in the buttry and
youd better heave a dish towel or sunthin over it to keep the ants
out Theres more ants in this house than there is dollars a good
sight Betsy B shes got a plan for keepin of em out by puttin
sassers of brimstone round the shelves but I told her s I THEM ants
dont care for no brimstone Theyre used to it Sometimes I blieve
theyre sent by the everlastin father of brimstone and she

She had reached the gate by this time and Grace shut off the flow of
conversation by closing the door Then she took a candle from the row
on the diningroom mantel lighted it and went up to her own room
Standing before the oldfashioned bureau with its little oval mirror
she hastily arranged her hair She did not wish to go to the prayer
meeting at the chapel but she felt that she must The ComeOuter
gatherings with their noisy singing and shouting had grown more and
more repugnant to her

And tonight of all nights How could she meet those people who had
known her since she was a child who boasted of her as one of their
staunchest adherents who believed in her and trusted her How could she
meet them and talk with them knowing what she knew and realizing that
they too would know it on the morrow But her uncle would miss her and
be worried about her if she did not come She could not bear to trouble
him now she never loved him so dearly was never so anxious to humor
his every wish as on this perhaps the last evening they would spend
together For though she would not yet admit it even to herself her
decision was made had really been made the first time John Ellery asked
her weeks before Only the thought of what might happen to him if she
consented had caused her to hesitate so long

She blew out the candle and came out into the hall at the head of the
stairs She was about to descend when she heard voices The door of the
dining room opened and closed She felt certain that Nat had returned
and wondered who was with him Then she heard her uncles voice
speaking sharply and with unwonted sternness

I dont know what tis you want to see me about said Captain Eben
You say its important well its got to be to keep me from my
meetin I ought to be on the Lords business this minute and nothin
worldlys goin to keep me from servin Him So speak quick What is
it

The voice that answered was one that Grace recognized though she
had never before heard in it the note of agitation and undignified
excitement There were no ponderous pauses and Humhas now

Dont be a fool Hammond it said And dont stand there preaching
Lock that door Get a lamp Are you sure theres nobody but us in the
house

Captain Elkanah Daniels Captain Elkanah visiting a ComeOuter and
the leader of the ComeOuters Grace caught her breath What in the
worldShe started to descend and then a thought flashed to her mind
She stopped short

I aint the fool Elkanah she heard her uncle retort sternly The
fools are them who are deef to the call from on high My foot was on the
threshold of His house when you led me astray Its never halted there
afore I warn you

Hush Shut up Cant you forget thatthat ComeOuter circus of yours
for a minute

Elkanah Daniels Ill have no blasphemy here Another word like that
and

WILL you be still and hear me The Lords business I guess youll
think its the Lords business when you understand what Im going to
tell you The Lords business The devils business you better say
Will you lock that door

My church is waitin for me and

Let it wait Whats a parcel of yelling ComeOuters compared to the
decency of this town Stop Shut up Eben Hammond I tell you that your
precious churchyes and mine the Regular church of Trumetwill go to
rack and ruin if you and me dont pull together this night

And I tell you Elkanah Daniels Ill have no blasphemy here That
little sanctuary up the road is founded on a rock and neither you
nor any of your Phariseein priestworshipin crew can shake it The
Almightyll protect His own As for the Reglar church thats no
concern of mine

But I tell you tis your concern Or if the church isnt your own
family is

Mymy family

Yes your own family Huh that makes you listen dont it

There was an instant of silence Grace crouching on the stairs noticed
the change in her uncles voice as he answered

My own family he repeated slowly My ownAnd the Reglar
churchWhat do you mean Has Nat

No he aint But that cussed girl of yours

Stop Ebens shout rang through the house The listener heard it
rose and then sank slowly to her knees

Stop shouted Captain Hammond Elkanah Daniels for your own sake
now be careful If you dast to say a word another word like that
Ill

If I dast The hussy But theres no use talkin to you Youre as
crazy as a Bedlamite Either that or youre in the game with her If
you are I warn you

Stop What game What do you mean Gracie My Grace What is it For
mercy sakes Elkanah

Humph I wondered if I couldnt get some sense into you finally Lock
that door

I will I will But Elkanah

Lock it Give me the key

The click of the lock sounded sharply

Wheres the lamp demanded Daniels And the matches Dont stand
there shaking

A smell of sulphur floated out into the hall Then the sickly glow of
the fluid lamp shone through the doorway

What ails you asked Elkanah Are you struck dumb Now go and see if
theres anybody else in the house

Butbut there aint I know there aint Hannahs gone and Gracies at
meetin by this time

She Humph Well maybe shes at meeting and maybe she isnt Maybe
shes over in Peterss pines hugging and kissing that man shes met
there every Sunday for I dont know how longHere let go you old
fool Let go I tell you

A chair fell to the floor with a bang There was the sound of hard
breathing and rapid footsteps

Let go panted Daniels Are you crazy Take your hands off me

You liar snarled Captain Eben You lowlived liar By the Almighty
Elkanah Daniels IllYou take that back or Ill choke the everlastin
soul out of you I will

Let go you lunatic Youll kill yourself Listen Im not lying Its
the truth Shes met a man I tell you Been meeting him for months I
guess There now will you listen

The footsteps had ceased but the heavy breathing continued

A man gasped Eben A man Gracie Its aWho is he Whats his
name

His names John Ellery and hes minister of the Regular church in this
town thats who he is Here hold up Good Lord are you dying Hold
up

The girl on the stairs sprang to her feet Her head was reeling and she
could scarcely stand but she blindly began the descent She must go to
her uncle She must But Captain Danielss voice caused her to halt once
more

There there it said in a tone of relief Thats better Set still
now Be quiet thats it Shall I get some water

No no let me be Just let me be I aint what I used to be and
thisIm all right I tell you Grace AndandWhat was it you just
said II dont blieve I heard it right

I said that daughter of yours or niece or whatever she is this Grace
Van Horne has been meeting young Ellery our minister in Peterss
grove Been meeting him and walking with him and kissing him and

Its a lie It aint so Elkanah Prove it orItit CANT be so can
it Please

long time She was seen there with him this afternoon

Whowho saw her

We can stop em I know it would be a good catch for her the sneaking
designingWell never mind But it cant be It shant be Youve got
to tell her so Hammond We folks of the Regular church have pride in
our society we wont have it disgraced And we have been proud of our
minister the young rattleheaded fool Well save him if we can If
we cantthe speakers teeth gratedthen well send him to eternal
smash or die trying

But I cant believe its true Its a mistake some other girl and not
Gracie Why she dont even know him She wouldntBut she HAS been out
every Sunday afternoon for weeks If it SHOULD be

It is I tell you it is Dont waste time rolling your eyes and talking
stuff Weve got to work and youve got to work first I dont know
whether youre only making believe or not I realize that twould be
a good thing for your girl to marry a promising young chap like him
butHush let me go on I tell you Hammond it cant be We wont let
her I wont let her Im a man of influence in this town and outside
of it too Im head of the parish committee and a member of the
National Regular Society I cant reach your precious ward maybe but I
can reach the fellow shes after and if he marries her Ill drive em
both to the poorhouse

Heres where you come in Hammond It may be she does really care for
him Or maybe shes after position and money Well you talk to her You
tell her that if she keeps on going with him if she doesnt break off
this damnable business now tomorrow Ill ruin John Ellery as sure as
Im a living man Hell be ruined in Trumet anyhow Hell be thrown out
by the parish committee Im not sure that his church people wont
tar and feather him Marrying a lowdown ComeOuter hussy As if there
want decent girls of good families he might have had But losing this
church wont be the only thing thatll happen to him The committeell
see that he doesnt get another one Ill use my influence and have him
thrown out of the Regular ministry Think I cant What sort of yarns
do you suppose will be told about him and her meeting the way they did
Wont the county papers print some fine tales Wont the Boston ones
enjoy such a scandal I tell you Eben Hammond that young chaps name
will be dragged so deep in the mud itll never get clean again

He stopped for breath His companion was silent After a moment he
continued

You tell her that Hammond he went on If she really cares for him
itll be enough She wont let him ruin his life And Ill keep quiet
till I hear from you If shes sensible and really decent then she can
give him his clearance papers without his knowing why she did it and
everything will be a secret and kept so Nobody elsell ever know If
she wont do that then you tell me and Ill have a session with HIM
If THATS no good then out he goes and she with him and its ruination
for both of em reputations and all Why am I doing this Ill tell
you I like him He isnt orthodox enough to suit me but I have liked
him mighty well And AnnabHumph thats neither here nor there What
Im fighting for is the Trumet Regular church Thats MY church and
Ill have no dirty scandal with ComeOuters dragging it down Now you
understand Will you tell her what Ive said

The chair creaked Evidently Captain Eben was rising slowly to his
feet

Well repeated Elkanah

Elkanah Daniels said Eben slowly his voice shaking from nervous
exhaustion and weakness but with a fine ring of determination in every
word Elkanah Daniels you listen to me Ive heard you through If
your yarn is true then my heart is broke and I wish I might have died
afore I heard it But I didnt die and I have heard it Now listen to
me I love that girl of mine bettern the whole wide world and yet
Id ruther see her dead afore me than married to a Reglar minister
Disgrace to HIM Disgrace to your miserble church What about the
disgrace to MINE And the disgrace to HER Ruin to your minister Ruin
to my girl here and hereafter is what Im thinkin of that and my
people who worship God with me Ill talk to Grace Ill talk to
her But not of whatll happen to him or youor any of your cantin
lipservin crew Ill tell her to choose between him and me And if she
chooses him Ill send her out of that door Ill do my duty and read
her out of my congregation And Ill know shes gone to everlastin
hell and thats worsen the poorhouse Thats all tonight Elkanah
Now you better go

Humph Well I declare you ARE a bigoted

You go Theres the door

so as to stop her from getting himand said soon

Itll be said tonight Now go My people are waitin at the chapel

Youre not going to that prayer meeting after THIS

Where else should I go Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy
laden Andandhis voice brokeHe knows that I AM heavy laden
Lord Lord do help me for this is moren I can bear alone

The lock turned the door opened and closed Grace clinging to the
balusters heard Captain Hammond cross the room slowly and feebly
She heard him enter the sitting room Then she heard nothing more
not another sound though the minutes dragged on and on endlessly
eternally and each with a message a sentence repeated over and over
again in her brain If she really cares for him she wont let him ruin
his life

By and by pale but more composed and with her mind made up she came
down into the hall Drawing a long breath she turned into the sitting
room to face her uncle By the light shining through the diningroom
door she saw him on his knees by the haircloth sofa She spoke his name
He did not answer nor look up Alarmed she touched him on the shoulder
At her touch his arm slid from the couch and he fell gently over upon
his side on the carpet


CHAPTER XII

IN WHICH CAPTAIN EBEN MAKES PORT


Half past eight In the vestry of the Regular church John Ellery was
conducting his prayer meeting The attendance was as large as usual
Three seats however were vacant and along the settees people were
wondering where Captain Elkanah Daniels and his daughter might be They
had not missed a service for many a day And where was Keziah Coffin

At the ComeOuter chapel the testifying and singing were in full blast
But Ezekiel Bassett was leading for Captain Eben Hammond had not
made his appearance Neither had Grace Van Horne for that matter but
Captain Ebens absence was the most astonishing

Somethins the matter whispered Josiah Badger to his righthand
neighbor Somethins wrong ddddown to the tavern sartin sure
Im goin down there just soons meetins over and ffffind out
Eben wouldnt no more miss leadin his meetin from choice than Id go
without a meals vvvivittles Somethins happened and Im goin to
know what tis Youll go along with me wont ye Lot

The answer was an affirmative In fact almost every worshiper in that
chapel had determined to visit the Hammond tavern as soon as the service
was at an end


In the Regular parsonage Keziah sat alone by the sittingroom table
Prayer meeting and supper she had forgotten entirely The minister
had not come home for his evening meal and food was furthest from the
housekeepers thoughts What should she do What ought she to do How
could she avert the disaster so certain to overwhelm those two young
people the moment their secret became known

It was in vain that she tried to encourage herself with the hope that
Kyan had exaggeratedthat the meetings in the grove had not been as
frequent as he said they were or that they had been merely casual
She knew better She had seen the pair together and the look in John
Ellerys eyes No the mischief was done they loved each other or at
least he loved her There was the great trouble

Keziah in spite of her worldly common sense was an idealist at heart
Love matches she believed in thoroughly If the man had not been a
Regular minister or if he had been a minister in any other town than
narrow gossiping squabbling Trumet where families were divided on
religious grounds neighbors did not speak because their creeds were
different and even after death were buried in cemeteries three miles
apart if the girl had been other than the ward of bigoted old Eben
Hammondthen though they were poor as poverty itself Keziah would
have joined their hands and rejoiced Even as it was she was strongly
tempted to do it Her sense of right and her every inclination urged her
toward that course Face the world together and fight it out that
was the advice she would like to give them But no the battle was too
uneven The odds were too great They must not think of marriage for
the present and they must cease to meet Perhaps some dayshe tried to
comfort herself with the thoughtperhaps some day years afterwards and
under different circumstances they might

With Ellery she felt certain she could accomplish nothing by argument
or persuasion She knew him well enough by this time to realize that if
his mind was made up all Trumet and all creation could not change it
He would keep on his course and if wrecked would go down with colors
set and helm lashed But Grace perhaps she did not fully realize the
situation She might be made to see to listen to reason And perhaps
it was possibleperhaps on her part matters were not as serious The
minister had not acted like a triumphant lover assured of success
he had seemed now that she thought of it more like a pleader a
supplicant Perhaps if she could see Grace and talk plainly with the
girl it might not be too late She determined to try that very night

She rose and again donned her bonnet and shawl She was about to blow
out the lamp when she heard rapid footsteps the sound of some one
running along the sidewalk in front of the house As she listened the
footsteps sounded on the path Whoever the runner was he was coming to
the parsonage She stepped to the door and opened it

The runner was a boy Maria Higginss boy Isaac whose widowed mother
lived down by the shore He did the chores at the Hammond tavern His
freckled face was dripping with perspiration and he puffed and blew like
a stranded whale

Whats the matter Ike demanded Keziah What is it

Have yehave ye panted Ike have ye seen the doctor anywheres Mis
Coffin

Who Dr Parker Have I seenwhat in the world are you comin HERE
after the doctor for

Causecause I didnt know where else to come I been to his house

house doors open and the shays gone so

She dont know He aint to home But I got to find Dr Parker

Hold on Stop Ill tell you where the doctor is most likely Up to

Run run fast as ever you can and get him and Ill go to Grace this
minute The poor thing Have you told anybody else

No no aint seen nobody but you to tell They was prayin over to
meetin and the fellers that waits outside to keep compny with the
girls aint got there yet And I never met nobody And twas so blasted
dark I fell down four times and tore my best pants and

Sshsh Listen to me Dont tell anybody Not a soul but the doctor
Half this townll be runnin to find out if you do and that poor girl
must be distracted already Ill go to her You get Dr Parker and tell
him to hurry

Ill tell him dont you fret

He was gone running harder than ever A moment later Keziah followed
him running also

It was a misty black night and Trumet sidewalks were uneven and hard
to navigate But she stumbled on up the main road to the Corners down
the Turnoff past the chapel of the ComeOuters from the open window
of which sounded the drone of a high nasal voice Josiah Badger was
testifying and Keziah caught a fragment of the testimony as she
hurried by

I says to em says I I says to em I dont care about your smart
mummumminister and what fine sermons he preaches Let him BE smart I
says Says I Smartness wont ggggit ye into heaven Amen No
sirree it takes moren that Ive seen smart folks afore and they got
cccukcatched up with sooner or later Pride goes ahead of a tumble
Ive heard tell and

This was all that Keziah heard of Mr Badgers testimony for as she
ran on a rattle of wheels and the thud of hoofs came from behind her
Then a rocking chaise drawn by a galloping horse shot by Dr Parkers
carriage she was sure The Higgins boy must have met the doctor and
delivered his message

The horse and chaise were standing by the front gate of the tavern as
she pantingly drew near it The side door of the house was ajar and she
opened it softly and entered The dining room was empty There was a
light on the sittingroom table and low voices came from the little
bedroom adjoining Then from the bedroom emerged Dr Parker and Grace
Van Horne The girl was white and there were dark circles under her
eyes The doctor was very grave

Keziah stepped forward and held out both hands Grace looked recognized
her and with a cry ran toward her Keziah took her in her arms and
soothed her as if she were a child

There there deary she said stroking her hair There there
deary dont take it so hard Poor thing youre worn out If Id only
known sooner

O Aunt Keziah sobbed the girl Im so glad youve come It was so
good of you

Good Land of mercy If I hadnt come Id have been worse than the
beasts that perish Dont cry dont How is he now Some better

She looked at the doctor as she asked it He shook his head
emphatically

Well well dear went on Mrs Coffin hurriedly He will be pretty
soon well hope You mustnt give up the ship you know Now you go and
lay down somewheres and Ill get my things off and see what there is to
do Some good strong tea might be good for all hands I guess likely
Wheres Hannah Poundberry

Shes gone to her cousins to stay all night I suppose I ought to send
for her but I

No no you hadnt Mights well send for a poll parrot the critter
would be just as much good and talk less Ill look out for things me
and the doctor Whereswheres Nat

He came in just after I sent the boy for the doctor Hes in there
withwith him indicating the bedroom Poor Nat

Keziah looked longingly toward the door

Yes she said slowly Poor fellow its an awful shock to him He and
his father areBut there you lay down on that lounge

I cant lie down I cant do anything but think Oh what a dreadful
day this has been And I thought it was going to be such a happy one

Yes yes deary I know

Grace raised her head

You know she repeated looking up into the housekeepers face

I mean I know its been a dreadful day explained Keziah quickly
Yes indeed it has with a sigh But there our moanin over it dont
cheer it up any Will you lay down No Well then SET down theres a
good girl

Grace protesting that she couldnt sit down she couldnt leave uncle
and there were so many things to do was at last persuaded by Keziah and
the doctor to rest for a few moments in the big rocker Then Mrs Coffin
went into the kitchen to prepare the tea As she went she beckoned to
Dr Parker who joined her a moment later

Well doctor she asked anxiously

The stout grayhaired old physicianhe had practiced in Trumet for
nearly thirty yearsshook his head

Not a single chance he whispered He may possibly live till morning
but I doubt if he lasts an hour Its his heart Ive expected it at
any time Ever since he had that shock Ive been at him to take things
easy but you might as well talk to a graven image That ComeOuter
foolishness is what really killed him though just what brought on this
attack I cant make out Grace says she found him lying on the floor by
the sofa He was unconscious then Im rather worried about her She was
very near to fainting when I got here

No wonder All alone in this ark of a house and nobody to help or to
send Lucky she found that Ike Higgins Say I wonder if the young
ones around here now If he is he must stand at the gate and scare off
ComeOuters The whole chapel mates crew and cabin boy ll be down
here soons meetins over to see what kept Eben And they mustnt get
in

I should say not Ill hunt up Ike If a ComeOuter gets into this
house tonight Ill eat him thats all

Some of em would give you dyspepsy I guess Yes Grace Ill be there
in a jiffy

The doctor left the house to find young Higgins and post him at the
gate The boy who had been listening under the window was proud of his
new responsibility

Ill fix em doctor he declared I only hope old Zeke Bassett
comes He lammed me with a horsewhip tother day cause I was ridin
behind his ox cart If he tried to git by me Ill bounce a rock offn
his Sunday hat

Doctor whispered Keziah from the kitchen window Doctor come quick
Nat wants you

Captain Nat was standing at the door of the bedroom His face was drawn
and he had seemingly grown years older since noon

Hes come to himself doc he whispered He dont remember how it
happened or anything And he wants us all Why why Keziah are you
here

Yes Nat Ive been here a little while

He looked at her steadily and his eyes brightened just a trifle

Did you come to see me he asked Was it about what I said this

No no Nat no I heard the news and that Grace was alone so I come
right down

He nodded wearily

You can come in too he said I know dad likes you and I guessWait
a minute Ill ask him He stepped back into the bedroom Yes he
nodded returning you come too He wants you

The little room Captain Ebens own was more like a skippers cabin
than a chamber on land A narrow single bed a plain washstand a
battered painted bureau and a single chairthese made up the list of
furniture Two pictures both of schooners under full sail hung on the
walls Beside them hung a ships barometer a sextant and a clock that
struck the bells instead of the hours as the landsman understands
them In the corner stood the captains big boots and his oilskins hung
above them His Sunday cane was there also And on the bureau was a
worn heavy Bible

Dr Parker brushed by the others and bent over the bed

Well capn he said cheerily hows she headed How are you feeling
now

The old face on the pillow smiled feebly

Shes headed for home I guess doc said Captain Eben Bound for
home and the harbor light broad abeam I callate

Oh no youll make a good many voyages yet

Not in this hulk I wont doctor I hope Ill have a new command
pretty soon Im trustin in my owners and I guess theyll do the fair
thing by me Halloo Gracie girl Well your old uncles on his beam
ends aint he

Grace glanced fearfully at his face When he spoke her name she shrank
back as if she feared what he might say But he only smiled as with
the tears streaming down her face she bent over and kissed him

There there he protested You mustnt cry What are you cryin
about me for We know you and me whos been lookin out for us and
keepin us on the course all these years We aint got anything to cry
for You just keep on bein a good girl Gracie and goin to the right
church andI spose Ezekielll lead in meetin now he added I do
wish he was a stronger man

The doctor whose fingers had been upon the old mans wrist looked up
at Nat significantly

There dad said the latter dont you worry about Zeke Bassett nor
anything else You just lay in dry dock and let Parker here overhaul
your runnin riggin and get you fit for sea Thats what youve got to
do

Im fit and ready for the sea Im goin to sail was the answer His
eyes wandered from his son to Mrs Coffin For an instant he seemed
puzzled Then he said

Evenin Keziah I dont know why youre here but

I heard that Grace was alone and that you was sick Eben So I come
right down to help if I could

Thank ye Youre a goodhearted woman Keziah even though you
aint seen the true light yet And youre housekeeper for that hired
priestaa He paused and a troubled look came over his face

What is it dad asked Nat

IIWheres Gracie Shes here aint she

Yes uncle Im here Here I am said the girl His fingers groped for
her hand and seized it

Yes yes youre here murmured Captain Eben IIfor a minute or
so II had an awful dream about you Gracie I dreamedNever mind

Well you aint so why should I hush In thisthis dream I had seems

He tried to rise Nat and the doctor started forward Grace shrank back

Of course it was capn said the doctor briskly Now you mustnt

Belay I tell you Yes I guess twas a dream It had to be but twas
so sort of real that IHow long have I been this way

Oh a little while Now just

Hush Dont pull your hand away Gracie Nat give me yours Thats it
Now I put them two hands together See doctor See Keziah

began to comprehend what was coming looked fearfully at Nat and the
girl

No I aint wanderin neither declared the old ComeOuter fretfully
Im sane as ever I was and if you try to stop me IllGracie your
Uncle Ebens vyage is most over Hes almost to his moorins and
theyre waitin for him on the pier II wont be long now Just a
little while Lord Give me just a little while to get my house in

Sshsh Dont put me off Just listen I want you to marry my boy

Grace would have withdrawn her hand but he would not let her He clung
to it and to that of his son with all his failing strength

Will you Gracie he begged Its the last thing Im goin to ask of
you Ive tried to be sort of good to you in my way and

Dont dont she sobbed Let me think a minute uncle dear Oh do
let me think

I aint got time Gracie Youll have to say it now or elseAll

Grace was thinking If she really cares for him she wont let him ruin
his life That was what Captain Elkanah had said And here was a way to
save him from ruin

Wont you say it for me Gracie pleaded Captain Eben She hesitated
no longer

Yes uncle she answered through tears if Nat wants me he can have
me

Keziah clasped her hands Captain Ebens face lit up with a great joy

Thank the Almighty he exclaimed Lord I do thank you Nat boy
youre considerble older than she is and youll have to plan for her
You be a good husband to her all her days wont ye Why what are you
waitin for Why dont you answer me

Nat groaned aloud

A minute dad he stammered Just give me a minute for Heaven sakes
Keziah

Keziah repeated Eben Keziah What are you talkin to HER for She
knows there couldnt be no better match in the world You do know it
dont ye Keziah

Yes said Keziah slowly I guessI guess youre right Eben

Keziah Coffin cried Nat Hammond do you tell me to marry Grace

Yes Nat II think your fathers right

Thenthenwhat difference doesAll right dad Just as Grace says

Thank God cried Captain Eben Doctor you and Mrs Coffin are
witnesses to this There now my decks are clear and Id better get
ready to land Gracie girl the Good Books over there on the bureau
Read me a chapter wont you

An hour later Keziah sat alone in the dining room She had stolen away
when the reading began Dr Parker walking very softly came to her and
laid his hand on her shoulder

Hes gone he said simply


CHAPTER XIII

IN WHICH KEZIAH BREAKS THE NEWS


It was nearly five oclock gray dawn of what was to be a clear
beautiful summer morning when Keziah softly lifted the latch and
entered the parsonage All night she had been busy at the Hammond
tavern Busy with the doctor and the undertaker who had been called
from his bed by young Higgins busy with Grace soothing her comforting
her as best she could and petting her as a mother might pet a
stricken child The poor girl was on the verge of prostration and from
hysterical spasms of sobs and weeping passed to stretches of silent
dryeyed agony which were harder to witness and much more to be feared

It is all my fault she repeated over and over again All my fault I
killed him I killed him Aunt Keziah What shall I do Oh why couldnt
I have died instead It would have been so much better better for
everybody

Sssh sssh deary murmured the older woman Dont talk so you
mustnt talk so Your uncle was ready to go Hes been ready for ever so
long and those of us who knew how feeble he was expected it any time
Twant your fault at all and hed say so if he was here now

No he wouldnt Hed say just as I do that I was to blame You dont
know Aunt Keziah Nobody knows but me

Maybe I do Gracie dear maybe I do Maybe I understand bettern you
think I do And its all been for the best Youll think so too one
of these days It seems hard now it is awful hard you poor thing but
its all for the best Im sure Best for everyone Its a mercy he went
sudden and rational same as he did The doctor says that if he hadnt
hed have been helpless and bedridden and maybe out of his head for
another year He couldnt have lived longern that at the most

But you DONT know Aunt Keziah You dont know what II AM to blame
Ill never forgive myself And Ill never be happy again

Yes you will Youll come some day to think it was best and right
for you andand for others I know you think youll never get over it
but you will Somehow or other you will same as the rest of us have
had to do The Lord tries us mighty hard sometimes but He gives us the
strength to bear it There there dont deary dont

Dr Parker was very anxious

She must rest he told Mrs Coffin She must or her brain will give
way Im going to give her something to make her sleep and you must get
her to take it

So Keziah tried and at last Grace did take the drug In a little while
she was sleeping uneasily and with moans and sobbings but sleeping
nevertheless

Now its your turn Keziah said the doctor You go home now and
rest yourself We dont need you any more just now

Whereswheres Capn Nat asked Keziah

Hes in there with his father He bears it well although he is mighty
cut up Poor chap he seems to feel that he is to blame somehow Says
Capn Eben and he had disagreed about something or other and he fears
that hastened the old mans death Nonsense of course It was bound to
come and I told him so Twas those blasted ComeOuters who really did
it although I shant say so to anyone but you Im glad Nat and the
girl have agreed to cruise together Its a mighty good arrangement She
couldnt have a better man to look out for her and he couldnt have a
better wife I suppose Im at liberty to tell people of the engagement
hey

Yes Yes I dont see any reason why not YesI guess likely youd
better tell em

All right Now you go home Youve had a hard night like the rest of
us

How hard he had no idea And Keziah as she wearily entered the
parsonage realized that the morning would be perhaps the hardest
of all For upon her rested the responsibility of seeing that the
ministers secret was kept And she and no other must break the news
to him

The dining room was dark and gloomy She lighted the lamp Then she
heard a door open and Ellerys voice as he called down the stairs

Who is it he demanded Mrs Coffin

She was startled Yes she said softly after a moment Yes Mr
Ellery its me What are you doin awake at such an hours this

Yes Im awake I couldnt sleep well tonight somehow Too much
to think of I imagine But where have you been Why werent you at
meeting And whereWhy its almost morning

She did not answer at once The temptation was to say nothing now to
put off the trying scene as long as possible

Its morning repeated the minister Are you sick Has anything
happened

Yes she answered slowly somethin has happened Are you dressed
Could you come down

He replied that he would be down in a moment When he came he found
her standing by the table waiting for him The look of her face in the
lamplight shocked him

Why Mrs Coffin he exclaimed What IS it You look as if you had
been through some dreadful experience

Maybe I have she replied Maybe I have Experiences like that come
to us all in this life to old folks and young and we have to bear em
like men and women Thats the test were put to Mr Ellery and the
way we come through the fire proves the stuff were made of Sorrows and
disappointments and heartbreaks and sicknesses and death

She paused on the word He interrupted her

Death he repeated Death Is some one dead some one I know Mrs
Coffin what is it you are trying to tell me

Her heart went out to him She held out both her hands

You poor boy she cried Im trying to tell you one of the hardest
things a body can tell Yes some one is dead but that aint all Eben
Hammond poor soul is out of his troubles and gone

Eben Hammond Captain Eben Dead Why why

Yes Ebens gone He was took down sudden and died about ten oclock
last night I was there and

Captain Eben dead Why he was as well asasShe saidOh I must go
I must go at once

He was on his way to the door but she held it shut

No she said gravely you mustnt go You mustnt go Mr Ellery
Thats the one thing you mustnt do

You dont understand By and by I can tell you why I must be there but
now

I do understand I understand it all Lord help us if Id only
understood sooner how much of this might have been spared Why DIDNT
you tell me

Mrs Coffin

Johnyou wont mind my callin you John Im old enough pretty nigh
to be your mother and Ive come to feel almost as if I was John
youve got to stay here with me You cant go to that house You cant
go to her

Mrs Coffin what are you saying Do you knowHave you

Yes I know all about it I know about the meetins in the pines and
all Oh why didnt you trust me and tell me If you had all would have
been SO much better

He looked at her in utter amazement The blood rushed to his face

You know THAT he whispered

Yes I know

Did she tell

No nobody told That is only a little I got a hint and I suspicioned
somethin afore The rest I saw with my own eyes

He was now white but his jaw shot forward and his teeth closed

If you do know he said you must realize that my place is with her
Now when she is in trouble

Would you want to make that trouble greater More than she could bear

I think I might help her to bear it Mrs Coffin you have been my
truest friend but one in Trumet You HAVE been like a mother to me
But I have thought this out to the end and I shall go through with it
It is my affairand hers If my own mother were alive and spoke as you
do I should still go through with it It is right it is my life Im
not ashamed of anything Ive done Im proud Im proud of her And
humble only when I think how unworthy I am to be her husband I suppose
you are fearful of what my congregation will say Well Ive thought of
that too and thought it through Whatever they say and whatever they
do will make no difference Do you suppose I will let THEM keep me from
her Please open that door

He was very tragic and handsomeand young as he stood there The tears
overflowed the housekeepers eyes as she looked at him If her own love
story had not been broken off at its beginning if she had not thrown
her life away she might have had a son like that She would have given
all that the years had in store for her given it gladly to have been
able to open the door and bid him go But she was firm

It aint the congregation John she said Nor Trumet nor your
ministry That means moren you think it does now but it aint that
You mustnt go to her becausewell because she dont want you to

Doesnt want me I know better He laughed in supreme scorn

She doesnt want you John She wouldnt see you if you went She would
send you away again sure sartin sure She would And if you didnt
go when she sent you you wouldnt be the man I hope you are John you
mustnt see Grace again She aint yours She belongs to some one else

Some one else He repeated the words in a whisper Some one ELSE
Why Mrs Coffin you must be crazy If you expect me to

Hush hush I aint crazy though theres times when I wonder I aint
John you and Grace have known each other for a few months thats
all Youve been attracted to her because she was pretty and educated
andand sweet and shes liked you because you were about the only
young person who could understand her andand all that And so youve
been meetin and have come to believeyou have anywaythat twas
somethin more than likin But you neither of you have stopped to think
that a marriage between you two was as impossible as anything could be
And besides theres another man A man shes known all her life and
loved and respected

Stop Mrs Coffin stop this wicked nonsense I wont hear it

John Grace Van Horne is goin to marry Capn Nat Hammond There
thats the livin truth

In his absolute confidence and faith he had again started for the door
Now he wheeled and stared at her She nodded solemnly

Its the truth she repeated She and Nat are promised to each other
Capn Eben on his deathbed asked Dr Parker and me to be witnesses to
the engagement Now you see why you mustnt go nigh her again

He did not answer Instead he stood silently staring She stepped
forward and laid a hand on his shoulder

Set down John she said Set down and let me tell you about it Yes
yes you must If I tell you youll understand better There there
dont you interrupt me yet and dont you look that way Do set down

She led him over to the rockingchair and gently forced him into it
He obeyed although with no apparent realization of what he was doing
Still with her hand on his shoulder she went on speaking She told him
of her visit to the Hammond tavern saying nothing of Mr Peppers
call nor of her own experience in the grove She told of Captain Ebens
seizure of what the doctor said and of the old ComeOuters return to
consciousness Then she described the scene in the sick room and how Nat
and Grace had plighted troth He listened at first stunned and stolid
then with growing impatience

So you see she said Its settled theyre engaged and Dr Parker
will tell everybody of the engagement this very mornin It want any
great surprise to me Those two have been brought up together twas the
natural thing that was almost bound to happen Ebens heart was set on
it for years And shell have a good husband John that I know And
shell do her best to make him happy Hes a good man and

The minister sprang to his feet

A good man he cried furiously A good man One who will make use of
a dying father to drive a girl intoStand aside Mrs Coffin

John you mustnt speak that way of Nat Hammond He aint the kind to
drive a girl against her will And Grace is not one to be driven

Are you blind Cant you see Why only yesterday sheDo you think I
shall permit such a wicked crime as that to

Sssh No it aint wicked its right Right and best for everybody
for her especial Yesterday she might have forgot for a minute But
think just think what would have happened if she cared for you

But she does I know she does Mrs Coffin stand away from that door

No John if you go out of that door now to go to her youll have to
go by main strength You shant wreck yourself and that girl if I can
help it Be a man

The pair looked at each other Keziah was determined but so evidently
was he She realized with a sinking heart that her words had made
absolutely no impression He did not attempt to pass but he slowly
shook his head

Mrs Coffin he said perhaps you believe youre doing right I
hopeyes Ill give you credit for that belief But I KNOW I am right
and I shall go to her Such aa BARGAIN as that you have just told me
of is no more to be regarded than

John I beg you

NO

Then go Go this minute and break her heart and ruin her life and spoil
her good name in this village where shes lived since she was eight
years old Go be selfish I suppose thats part of a mans makeup Go
Never mind her Go

I do mind her as you call it I AM thinking of her

No youre not Its yourself

If it was myselfand God knows it is the only happiness on earth for
meif it was only myself and I really thought she wished me to stay
away Id stay Id stay though Id pray to die before this hour was
over

I know I know Ive prayed to die myself afore now but Im here yet
and so will you be We cant die so easy

But I know

Do you suppose SHE would come to YOU if she knew it would be your
ruin

He hesitated The last time they met ages beforeno only the previous
afternoonshe had told him it was his happiness and his future only
that she thought of He choked and drew his hand across his eyes

Mrs Coffin he said you tell me it will be her ruin YOU tell me
so You SAY she doesnt want me I tell you that the only thing that
will keep me from her is hearing that from her own lips When she tells
me to leave her I will and not before

Shell tell you John shell tell you I know you must despise me
pretty nigh I callate you think Im a worldly old woman carin
nothin for your feelins Maybe Ive talked pretty hard in the last few
minutes but I havent meant to be hard To be honest I didnt think
youd listen to me I expected youd insist on seein her yourself
Well then go and see her if you must though what will come of it
can only be more trouble for you run the risk of folks knowin it and
beginnin to wonder And I know Grace Shes made up her mind and wont
change it But I do ask you this I ask you not to go now Wait a little
while do I left her asleep worn out by what shes been through and
under the effects of the doctors sleepin medicine He said she must
rest or he was afraid her brain would give out For her sake then
wait a little Then if you dont hear from her maybe I can arrange a
meetin place where you can see her without anyones knowin it Ill
try But do wait a little while for her sake wont you

At last he was listening and hesitating

Wont you begged Keziah

Yes he answered slowly Ill wait Ill wait until noon somehow
if I can Ill try But not a minute later Not one You dont know what
youre asking Mrs Coffin

Yes I do I know well And I thank you for her sake

But he did not have to wait until noon At six oclock through the
dewsoaked grass of the yard came the Higgins boy For the first time
in his short life he had been awake all night and he moved slowly

The housekeeper opened the door Ike held up an envelope clutched in a
grimy hand

Its for you Mrs Keziah he said Gracie she sent it There aint
no answer

Keziah took the letter How is she And hows Nat she asked

Theyre doin pretty well so ma says Mas there now and theyve sent

Been on the jump now I tell ye Didnt none of them ComeOuters git in
not one I sent em on the home tack abilin You ought to hear me give
old Zeke Bassett Hail Columby Gosh I was just ahopin HED come

Mrs Coffin closed the door and tore open the envelope Within
was another addressed in Graces handwriting to Mr Ellery The
housekeeper entered the study handed it to him and turned away

The minister who had been pacing the floor seized the note eagerly
It was written in pencil and by a hand that had trembled much Yet there
was no indecision in the written words


Dear John wrote Grace I presume Aunt Keziah has told you of uncles
death and of my promise to Nat It is true I am going to marry him I
am sure this is right and for the best Our friendship was a mistake and
you must not see me again Please dont try

GRACE VAN HORNE


Beneath was another paragraph


Dont worry about me I shall be happy I am sure And I shall hope
that you may be I shall pray for that


The note fell to the floor with a rustle that sounded loud in the
stillness Then Keziah heard the ministers step She turned He was
moving slowly across the room

John she cried anxiously you poor boy

He answered without looking back

Imgoinguptomyroom he said a pause between each word I
want to be alone awhile Mrs Coffin

Wearily Keziah set about preparing breakfast Not that she expected the
meal would be eaten but it gave her something to do and occupied her
mind The sun had risen and the light streamed in at the parsonage
windows The breeze blew fresh and cool from the ocean It was a
magnificent morning

She called to him that breakfast was ready but he did not answer She
could eat nothing herself and when the table was cleared prepared
to do the weeks washing for Monday is always washday in Trumet Noon
came dinner time but still he did not come down At last Keziah could
stand it no longer She determined to go to him She climbed the steep
stairs and rapped on the door of his room

Yes she heard him say

Its me was the reply Mr Ellery can I come in I know you want
to be alone but I dont think youd ought to be too much Id like to
talk with you a few minutes may I

A moment passed before he told her to enter He was sitting in a chair
by the window dressed just as he had been when she returned from the
tavern She looked sharply at his face as it was turned toward her His
eyes were dry and in them was an expression so hopeless and dreary that
the tears started to her own

John she said I couldnt bear to think of your facin it alone up
here I just had to come

He smiled and the smile was as hopeless as the look in his eyes

Face it he repeated Well Mrs Coffin I must face it I suppose
Ive been facing it ever sincesince I knew And I find it no easier

John what are you goin to do

He shook his head I dont know he said Go away somewhere first
of all I guess Go somewhere andand try to live it down I cant of
course but I must try

Go away Leave Trumet and your church and your congregation

Did you suppose I could stay here

I hoped you would

And see the same people and the same places And do the same things
Seesee HER Did youhe moved impatientlydid you expect me to
attend the wedding

She put out her hand I know itll be hard she said stayin here I
mean But your duty to others

Dont you think weve heard enough about duty to others How about my
duty to myself

I guess thats the last thing we ought to think about in the world if
we do try to be fair and square Your church thinks a heap of you John
They build on you Youve done more in the little while youve been here
than Mr Langley did in his last fifteen years Weve grown and were
doin gooddoin it not talkin it in prayer meetin The parish
committee likes you and the poor folks in the society love you Old Mrs
Prince was tellin me only a little spell ago that she didnt know how
shed have pulled through this dreadful time if twant for you And
theres lots of others Are you goin to leave them And what reason
will you give for leavin

He shook his head I dont know he answered I may not give any But
I shall go

I dont believe you will I dont believe youre that kind Ive
watched you pretty sharp since you and I have been livin together and I
have more faith in you than that comes to You havent acted to me like
a coward and I dont think youll run away

Mrs Coffin it is so easy for you to talk Perhaps if I were in your
place I should be giving good advice about duty and not running away and
so on But suppose you were in mine

Well suppose I was

SupposeOh but there its past supposing

I dont knows tis My life hasnt been all sunshine and fair winds
by no means

Thats true I beg your pardon You have had troubles and from what
I hear youve borne them bravely But you havent had to face anything
like this

Havent I Well what is it youre asked to face Disappointment Ive
faced that Sorrow and heartbreak Ive faced them

Youve never been asked to sit quietly by and see the one you love more
than all the world marry some one else

How do you know I aint How do you know I aint doin just that now

Mrs Coffin

John Ellery you listen to me You think Im a homely old woman
probably set in my ways as an eightday clock I guess I look like it
and act like it But I aint so awful oldon the edge of forty thats
all And when I was your age I want so awful homely either I had
fellers aplenty hangin round and I could have married any one of a
dozen This aint boastin land knows Im fur from that I was brought
up in this town and even when I was a girl at school there was only one
boy I cared two straws about He and I went to picnics together and
to parties and everywhere Folks used to laugh and say we was keepin
compny even then

Well when I was eighteen after father died I went up to New Bedford
to work in a store there Wanted to earn my own way And this young
feller Im tellin you about went away to sea but every time he come
home from a voyage he come to see me and things went on that way till we
was promised to each other The engagement want announced but twas
so just the same Wed have been married in another year And then we
quarreled

Twas a fool quarrel same as that kind genrally are As much my fault
as his and as much his as mine I callate Anyhow we was both proud
or thought we was and neither would give in And he says to me Youll
be sorry after Im gone Youll wish me back then And says I BEIN a
fool I guess not Theres other fish in the sea He sailed and I did
wish him back but I wouldnt write fust and neither would he And then
come another man

She paused hesitated and then continued

Never mind about the other man He was handsome then in a way and he
had money to spend and he liked me He wanted me to marry him Ifif
the other the one that went away had written I never would have
thought of such a thing but he didnt write And my pride bein hurt
and all I finally said yes to the second chap My folks did all they
could to stop it they told me he was dissipated they said he had a bad
name they told me twant a fit match And his people havin money
was just as set against his takin a poor girl Both sides said ruin
would come of it But I married him

Well for the first year twant so bad Not happiness exactly but
not misery either That come later His people was well off and hed
never worked much of any He did for a little while after we was
married but not for long Then he begun to drink and carry on and lost
his place Pretty soon he begun to neglect me and at last went off to
sea afore the mast We was poor as poverty but I could have stood that
I did stand it I took in sewin and kept up an appearance somehow
Never told a soul His folks come patronizin around and offered me
money sos I neednt disgrace them I sent em rightabout in a hurry
Once in a while hed come home get tipsy and abuse me Still I said
nothin Thank God there was no children thats the one thing Ive
been thankful for

You cant keep such things quiet always People are bound to find out
They come to me and said Why dont you leave him but I wouldnt
I could have divorced him easy enough there was reasons plenty but I
wouldnt do that Then word came that he was dead drowned off in the
East Indies somewheres I come back here to keep house for Sol my
brother and I kept house for him till he died and they offered me this
place here at the parsonage There thats my story part of it moren
I ever told a livin soul afore except Sol

She ceased speaking The minister who had sat silent by the window
apathetically listening or trying to listen turned his head

I apologize Mrs Coffin he said dully you have had trials hard
ones But

But they aint as hard as yours you think Well I havent quite
finished yet After word come of my husbands death the other man come
and wanted me to marry him And I wanted tooh how I wanted to I
cared as much for him as I ever did more I guess But I wouldntI
wouldnt though it wrung my heart out to say no I give him upwhy
cause I thought I had a duty laid on me

Ellery sighed I can see but one duty he said That is the duty
given us by God to marry the one we love

Keziahs agitation which had grown as she told her story suddenly
flashed into flame

Is that as fur as you can see she asked fiercely Its an easy duty
thenor looks easy now Ive got a harder one its to stand by the
promise I gave and the man I married

He looked at her as if he thought she had lost her wits

The man you married he replied Why the man you married is dead

No he aint You remember the letter you saw me readin that night
when you come back from ComeOuters meetin Well that letter was from
him Hes alive

For the first time during the interview the minister rose to his feet
shocked out of his despair and apathy by this astounding revelation

Alive he repeated Your husband ALIVE Why Mrs Coffin this is

She waved him to silence Dont stop me now she said Ive told so
much let me tell the rest Yes hes alive Alive and knockin round
the world somewheres Every little while he writes me for money and if
I have any I send it to him Why Why cause Im a coward after all
I guess and Im scared hell do what he says he will and come back
Perhaps you think Im a fool to put up with it thats what most folks
would say if they knew it Theyd tell me I ought to divorce him Well
I cant I CANT I walked into the mess blindfold I married him in
spite of warnins and everything I took him for better or for worse
and now that hes turned out worse I must take my medicine I cant
live with himthat I cant dobut while HE lives Ill stay his wife
and give him what money I can spare Thats the duty I told you was laid
on me and its a hard one but I dont run away from it

John Ellery was silent What could he say Keziah went on

I dont run away from it she exclaimed and you mustnt run away
from yours Your church depends on you they trust you Are you goin
to show em their trust was misplaced The girl you wanted is to marry
another man thats true and its mighty hard But shell marry a good
man and by and by shell be happy

Happy he said scornfully

Yes happy I know shell be happy because I know shes doin whatll
be best for her and because I know him thats to be her husband Ive
known him all my life hes that other one thatthatand I give him up
to her yes I give him up to her and try to do it cheerful because I
know its best for him Hard for YOU Great Lord Amighty do you think
it aint hard for ME II

She stopped short then covering her face with her apron she ran from
the room John Ellery heard her descending the stairs sobbing as she
went

All that afternoon he remained in his chair by the window It was six
oclock supper time when he entered the kitchen Keziah looking up
from the ironing board saw him He was white and worn and grim but he
held out his hand to her

Mrs Coffin he said Im not going away Youve shown me what
devotion to duty really means I shall stay here and go on with my
work

Her face lit up Will you she said I thought you would I was sure
you was that kind


CHAPTER XIV

IN WHICH THE SEA MIST SAILS


They buried Captain Eben in the little ComeOuter cemetery at the rear
of the chapel A bleak windswept spot was that cemetery bare of trees
and with only a few graves and fewer headstones for the ComeOuters
were a comparatively new sect and their graveyard was new in
consequence The grave was dug in the yellow sand beside that of Mrs
Hammond Nats mother and around it gathered the fifty or sixty friends
who had come to pay their last tribute to the old sailor and tavern
keeper

The ComeOuters were there all of them and some members of the Regular
society Captain Zeb Mayo Dr Parker Keziah Coffin Mrs Higgins and
Ike Mrs Didama Rogers was there also not as a mourner but because
in her capacity as gatherer of gossip she made it a point never to
miss a funeral The Rev Absalom Gott ComeOuter exhorter at Wellmouth
preached the short sermon and Ezekiel Bassett added a few remarks Then
a hymn was sung and it was over The little company filed out of the
cemetery and Captain Eben Hammond was but a memory in Trumet

Keziah lingered to speak a word with Grace The girl looking very white
and worn leaned on the arm of Captain Nat whose big body acted as
a buffer between her and oversympathetic ComeOuters Mrs Coffin
silently held out both hands and Grace took them eagerly

Thank you for coming Aunt Keziah she said I was sure you would

Least I could do deary was the older womans answer Your uncle
and I was good friends once we havent seen each other so often of
late years but that aint changed my feelins Now you must go home and
rest Dont let any of thesewith a rather scornful glance at Josiah
Badger and Ezekiel and the Reverend Absalomthese Jobs comforters
bother you Nat you see that they let her alone wont you

Captain Nat nodded He too looked very grave and worn Ill tend to
them he said shortly Come Grace he added lets go

But the girl hung back Just a minute Nat she said IIwould you
mind if I spoke to Aunt Keziahalone I only want to say a word

Nat strode off to the cemetery gate where Josiah Badger stood
brandishing a red cotton handkerchief as a not tooclean emblem of
mourning Mr Badger eagerly sprang forward but ran into an impossible
barrier in the form of the captains outstretched arm Josiah protested
and the captain replied Grace leaned forward

Auntie she whispered tell me Did a letterDid he

Yes it came I gave it to him

Diddid he tell you Do you know

Yes I know deary

Did heis he

Hes well deary Hell be all right Ill look out for him

You will wont you You wont let him do anything

Not a thing Dont worry Weve had a long talk and hes going to
stay right here and go on with his work And nobody elsell ever know
Gracie

HowO Aunt Keziah how he must despise me

Despise you For doin what was your duty Nonsense Hell respect you
for it and come to understand twas best for both of you by and by
Dont worry about him Gracie I tell you Ill look out for him

I guess it will be better if he does despise me And hate me too He
cant despise and hate me more than I do myself But it IS rightwhat
Im doing and the other was wrong and wicked Auntie youll come and
see me wont you I shall be so lonesome

Yes yes Ill come Perhaps not right away Theres reasons why Id
better not come right away But by and by after its all settled and
you and Natshe hesitated for an instant in spite of herselfafter
you and Nat are married Ill come

Dont talk about that NOW Please dont

All right I wont You be a good brave girl and look out for Nat
thats your duty and Im sure youll do it And Ill do my best for
John

Do you call him John

Yup We had a sort ofof adoptin ceremony the other mornin and
IWell you see Ive got to have somebody to call by their front name
and hes about all Ive got left

O Aunt Keziah if I could be one half as patient and brave and sweet as
you are

Sssh here comes Nat Be kind to him Hes sufferin too maybe moren
you imagine Here she is Nat Take her back home and be good to her

The broadshouldered skipper led his charge out of the gate and down
the Turnoff Josiah Badger looked after them disgustedly As Keziah
approached he turned to her

I swan to man he exclaimed in offended indignation if I aint
losin my respect for that Nat Hammond Hes the fffufforardest
critter ever I see I was just agoin to hail Gracie and ask her what
she thought about my leadin some of the meetins now her uncle has been
called aloft I wanted to ask her about it fust afore Zeke Bassett
got ahead of me but that Nat wouldnt let me Told me she mustnt be
bbbbothered about little things now LITTLE things Now what do you
think of that Mrs Coffin And I spoke to Lot Taylor one of our own
sssassassiety and asked what he thought of it and he said for me to
go home set dddown and let my hhhhahhair grow Of all

I tell you what you do Josiah broke in the voice of Captain Zeb
Mayo you go home or somewhere else and set down and have it cut
Thatll take pretty nigh as long andll keep it from wearin out your
coat collar Keziah Ive been waitin for you Get in my shay and Ill
drive you back to the parsonage

Mrs Coffin accepted the invitation and a seat in the chaise beside
Captain Zeb The captain spoke of the dead ComeOuter and of his respect
for him in spite of the difference in creed He also spoke of the Rev
John Ellery and of the affection he had come to feel for the young man

I like that young feller Keziah he said Like him for a lot of
reasons same as the boy liked the hash For one thing his religion
aint all starch and no sugar Hes goodhearted and kind andand
human He seems to get just as much satisfaction out of the promise of
heaven as he does out of the sartainty of tother port He aint all the
time bangin the bulkhead and sniffin brimstone like parsons I have
seen Sulphurs all right for a spring medicine maybe but when June
comes I like to remember that God made roses Elkanah he comes to me a
while ago and he says Zebedee he says dont you think Mr Ellerys
sermons might be more orthodox Yes says I they might be but what
a mercy tis they aint He he he I kind of like to poke Elkanah in
the shirt front once in a while just to hear it crackle Say Keziah
you dont think the minister and Annabel are

No was the emphatic interruption I know they aint he aint
anyway

Good Them Danielses callate they own the most of this town already
if they owned the minister theyd swell up so the rest of us would have
to go aloft or overboard wed be crowded off the decks sure

No one owns him Havent you found that out

Yup I callate I have and I glory in his spunk

Im glad to hear you say so Of course Capn Elkanah is boss of the
parish committee and

What No he aint nuther Hes head of it but his vote counts just
one and no more What makes you say that

Oh nuthin Only I thought maybe long as Elkanah was feelin that Mr
Ellery want orthodox enough he might be goin to make a change

He might HE might Say Keziah Coffin there was Mayos in this town
and in this church afore the fust Daniels ever washed ashore and
theyll be here when the last one blows up with his own importance Im
on that parish committeeyou understandand Ive sailed ships and
handled crews I aint so old nor feeble but what I can swing a belayin
pin Boss Ill have you to know that no livin man bosses me

All right I didnt mean to stir you up Zebedee But from things Capn
Daniels has said I gathered that he was runnin the committee And as
Im a friend of Mr Ellery it

Friend Well som I aint I If you ever hear of Daniels tryin any
tricks against the minister you send for me thats all ILL show him
Boss Humph

The wily Keziah alighted at the parsonage gate with the feeling that she
had sown seed in fertile ground She was quite aware of Captain Zebs
jealousy of the great Daniels And the time might come when her parson
needed an influential friend on the committee and in the Regular
society

The news of the engagement between Captain Nat Hammond and Grace Van
Horne told by Dr Parker to one or two of his patients spread through
Trumet like measles through a family of small children Didama Rogers
learned it so did Lavinia Pepper and after that it might as well
have been printed on the walls for all to read It was talked over and
gossiped about in every household from the lighthouse keepers family to
that of George Washington Cash who lived in the oneroom hovel in the
woods near the Wellmouth line and was a person of distinction in his
way being the sole negro in the county And whenever it was discussed
it was considered a fine thing for both parties concerned Almost
everyone said it was precisely what they expected

Annabel Daniels and her father had not expected it They were however
greatly pleased In their discussion which lasted far into the night
Captain Elkanah expressed the opinion that the unexpected denouement was
the result of his interview with Eben He had told the old ComeOuter
what would happen to his ward if she persisted in her impudent and
audacious plot to entrap a Regular clergyman She being discovered had
yielded perforce and had accepted Nat as the next best catch

Annabel was not satisfied with this explanation Of course she said
she did not pretend to believe Graces statement that she had found her
uncle unconscious No doubt the pair had had an interview and all that
But she believed the minister himself had come to his senses and had
dismissed the brazen creature She did not blame Mr Ellery so much He
was a young man with a kind heart and no doubt the Van Horne
person had worked upon his sympathies and had taken advantage of his
inexperience of feminine wiles

I think pa she said that its our duty yours and mine to treat
him just as we always have He doesnt know that we know and we will
keep the secret And as Christians we should forget and forgive Well
invite him here as we always have keep him under our good influence
and be very kind to him poor innocent As for Captain Hammond Im
sorry for him knowing the kind of wife he is going to have but no
doubt ComeOuters are not particular

Kyan Pepper was another whom the news of the engagement surprised
greatly When Lavinia told him of it at the dinner table he dropped
the knife he was holding and the greasy section of fishball balanced
upon it

Bishy said Miss Pepper what do you spose has happened down to the
Hammond tavern

Oh I know that was the reply I heard that long ago Capn Ebens
dead

Course hes dead and I knew you knew it Land sakes dont be such a
ninny Why I told you myself

Well I didnt know but youd forgot Anybodys lible to forget who
theyve told things to Why Ive forgot more things

Yes there aint no doubt about that Ive told you a million times
if I have once to tuck your napkin round your neck when youve got
your Sunday clothes on And there you be this minute without a sign of a
napkin

Why Laviny I MUST have it round my neck I know I

Dont be so foolish Think Im blind Cant I see you aint got it Now
where is it

Kyan began a futile hunt for the missing napkin in his lap on the
table and finally under it

I dont understand he stammered where that napkin can be Im just
as sure I had it and now Im just as sure I aint got it What do you
spose I done with it

Goodness knows Twouldnt surprise me if youd et it youre that
absentminded Here whats that stickin out of your breast pocket

Her brother put his hand to the pocket indicated and produced the
missing napkin much crumpled

There he exclaimed in a tone of relief Now I remember It must
have dropped on the floor and I thought twas my handkerchief and picked
it up and

What did you think youd be carryin a white handkerchief for on a
week day

Well I had on my Sunday suit and

Yes and for the dear mercy sakes WHY have you got it on

Kyan saw an opportunity for selfjustification

You TOLD me to put it on he declared triumphantly You said yourself
Id better rig out in my Sunday clothes cause we might go to Ebens
funeral You know you did

Hear the man And then after youve dressed up to go to his funeral
you pretend to believe Im goin to tell you hes dead I never

Well what IS it then He aint come to life has he

Grace Van Hornes engaged to be married thats what it is Look out
Oh you

Just here occurred the accident already described Knife and fish ball
descended upon the waistcoat belonging to the Sunday suit Lavinia
flew for warm water ammonia and a cloth and the soiled waistcoat
was industriously scrubbed The cleansing process was accompanied by a
lively tongue lashing to which Kyan paid little attention

Engaged he kept repeating Gracie Van Horne engaged Engaged En

Be still you poll parrot Dear dear dear look at them spots Yes
yes dont say it again shes engaged

Whowhowho

Now youve turned to an owl I do believe Hoo hoo Shes engaged to
Nat Hammond thats who Nothin very surprisin about that is there

Kyan made no answer He rubbed his forehead while his sister rubbed the
grease spots In jerky sentences she told of the engagement and how the
news had reached her

I cant believe it faltered Abishai She goin to marry Nat Why I
cant understand I thought

What did you think See here you aint keepin anything from me be
you

The answer was enthusiastically emphatic

No no no no declared Kyan Only I didnt know they waswas

Neither did anybody else but what of it Folks dont usually advertise
when theyre keepin compny do they

Noo But its genrally found out I know if I was keepin
compnyor you was Laviny

His sister started

What makes you say that she demanded looking quickly up from her
rubbing

Why nothin Only if I wasor you was somebodyd see somethin
suspicious and kind of drop a hint and

Better for them if they tended to their own affairs was the sharp
answer I aint got any patience with folks thats always talkin about
their neighbors doins There now you go out and stand alongside the
cook stove till that wet place dries Dont you move till TIS dry
neither

So to the kitchen went Kyan to stand a sort of living clotheshorse
beside the hot range But during the drying process he rubbed his
forehead many times Remembering what he had seen in the grove he could
not understand but he also remembered even more vividly what Keziah
Coffin had promised to do if he ever breathed a word And he vowed again
that that word should not be breathed

The death and funeral of Captain Eben furnished Trumet with a subject of
conversation for a week or more Then at the sewing circle and at the
store and after prayer meeting both at the Regular meeting house and
the ComeOuter chapel speculation centered on the marriage of Nat and
Grace When was it to take place Would the couple live at the old house
and keep packet tavern or would the captain go to sea again taking
his bride with him Various opinions pro and con were expressed by the
speculators but no one could answer authoritatively because none knew
except those most interested and the latter would not tell

John Ellery heard the discussions at the sewing circle when in company
with some of the men of his congregation he dropped in at these
gatherings for tea after the sewing was over He heard them at church
before and after the morning service and when he made pastoral calls
People even asked his opinion and when he changed the subject inferred
some of them that he did not care about the doings of ComeOuters Then
they switched to inquiries concerning his health

You look awful peaked lately Mr Ellery said Didama Rogers Aint
you feelin well

The minister answered that he was as well as usual or thought he was

No no you aint nuther declared Didama You looks if you was
comin down with a spell of somethin I aint the only one thats
noticed it Why Thankful Payne says to me only yesterday Didama
says she the ministers got somethin on his mind and its wearin of
him out You aint got nothin on your mind have you Mr Ellery

I guess not Mrs Rogers Its a beautiful afternoon isnt it

There I knew you want well A beautiful afternoon and it hottern
furyation and gettin ready to rain at that Dont tell me Taint your
mind Mr Ellery its your blood thats gettin thin My husband had a
spell just like it a year or two afore he died and the doctor said
he needed rest and a change Said hed ought to go away somewheres by
himself I put my foot down on THAT in a hurry The idea I
says You a sick man goin off all alone by yourself to die of
lonesomeness If you go I go with you So him and me went up to Boston
and it rained the whole week we was there and we set in a little box of
a hotel room with a window that looked out at a brick wall and set and
set and set and thats all I kept talkin to him to cheer him up but
he never cheered Id talk to him for an hour steady and when Id
stop and ask a question hed only groan and say yes when he meant no
Finally I got disgusted after Id asked him somethin four or five
times and hed never answered and I told him I believed he was gettin
deef Lordy he says I wish I was Well that was enough for ME
Says I If your minds goin to give out wed better be home So home
we come And thats all the good change and rest done HIM Hey What did
you say Mr Ellery

Eroh nothing nothing Mrs Rogers

Yes So home we come and Id had enough of doctors to last I figgered
out that his blood was thinnin and I knew what was good for that My
great Aunt Hepsy that lived over to East Wellmouth she was a great
hand for herbs and such and shed give me a receipt for thickenin the
blood that was somethin wonderful It had more kind of healin herbs in
it than you could shake a stick at I cooked a kittleful and got him to
take a dose four times a day He made more fuss than a young one about
takin it Said it tasted like the Evil One and such profane talk and
that it stuck to his mouth sos he couldnt relish his vittles but I
never let up a mite He had to take it and it done him a world of good
Now Ive got that receipt yet Mr Ellery and Ill make some of that
medicine for you Ill fetch it down tomorrow Yes yes I will Im
agoin to so you neednt say no And perhaps Ill have heard somethin
about Capn Nat and Grace by that time

She brought the medicine and the minister promptly on her departure
handed it over to Keziah who disposed of it just as promptly

What did I do with it repeated the housekeeper Well Ill tell you
I was kind of curious to see what twas like so I took a teaspoonful
I did intend to pour the rest of it out in the henyard but after that
taste I had too much regard for the hens So I carried it way down
to the pond and threw it in jug and all Brrr Of all the messes
thatI used to wonder what made Josh Rogers go moonin round makin his
lips go as if he was crazy I thought he was talkin to himself but now
I know better he was TASTIN Brrr

Keziah was the life of the gloomy parsonage Without her the minister
would have broken down Time and time again he was tempted to give up
in spite of his promise and leave Trumet but her pluck and courage
made him ashamed of himself and he stayed to fight it out She watched
him and tended him and babied him as if he was a spoiled child
pretending to laugh at herself for doing it and at him for permitting
it She cooked the dishes he liked best she mended his clothes she
acted as a buffer between him and callers who came at inopportune
times She was cheerful always when he was about and no one would have
surmised that she had a sorrow in the world But Ellery knew and
she knew he knew so the affection and mutual esteem between the two
deepened He called her Aunt Keziah at her request and she continued
to call him John This was in private of course in public he was
Mr Ellery and she Mrs Coffin

In his walks about town he saw nothing of Grace She and Mrs Poundberry
and Captain Nat were still at the old home and no one save themselves
knew what their plans might be Yet oddly enough Ellery was the first
outsider to learn these plans and that from Nat himself

He met the captain at the corner of the Turnoff one day late in
August He tried to make his bow seem cordial but was painfully aware
that it was not Nat however seemed not to notice but crossed the
road and held out his hand

How are you Mr Ellery he said I havent run across you for
sometime Whats the matter Seems to me you look rather under the
weather

Ellery answered that he was all right and remembering that he had
not met the captain since old Hammonds death briefly expressed his
sympathy His words were perfunctory and his manner cold His reason
told him that this man was not to blamewas rather to be pitied if
Keziahs tale was true Yet it is hard to pity the one who is to marry
the girl you love Reason has little to do with such matters

Well Mr Ellery said Captain Nat I wont keep you I see youre in
a hurry Just thought Id run alongside a minute and say goodby Dont
knows Ill see you again afore I sail

Before you sail Youyou are going away

Yup My owners have been after me for a good while but I wouldnt

be gettin back on salt water again My ships been drydocked and
overhauled and shes in New York now loadin for Manila Its a long
vyage even if I come back direct which aint likely So I may not see

about you I callate Trumet needs you

a way you see

Yes Ill tell her that too

And dont forget the friend part Well so long

They shook hands and parted

Didama and her fellow newsvenders distributed the tale of Captain Nats
sailing broadcast during the next few days There was much wonderment
at the delayed marriage but the general verdict was that Captain Ebens
recent death and the proper respect due to it furnished sufficient
excuse Hannah Poundberry delighted at being so close to the center of
interest talked and talked and thus Grace was spared the interviews
which would have been a trouble to her Nat left town via the packet
on the following Wednesday Within another week came the news that his
ship the Sea Mist had sailed from New York bound for Manila Her
topsails sank beneath the horizon and she vanished upon the wild waste
of tumbling waves and out of Trumets knowledge as many another vessel
manned and officered by Cape Cod men had done The village talked of
her and her commander for a few days and then forgot them both Only at
the old home by the landing and at the parsonage were they remembered


CHAPTER XV

IN WHICH TRUMET TALKS OF CAPTAIN NAT


Summer was over autumn came passed and it was winterJohn Ellerys
first winter in Trumet Fish weirs were taken up the bay filled with
ice the packet ceased to run and the village settled down to hibernate
until spring The stage came through on its regular trips except when
snow or slush rendered the roads impassable but passengers were very
few Occasionally there were northeast gales with shrieking winds
driving gusts of sleet and hail and a surf along the ocean side that
bellowed and roared and tore the sandy beach into new shapes washing
away shoals and building others blocking the mouth of the little inlet
where the fish boats anchored and opening a new channel a hundred yards
farther down Twice there were wrecks one of a fishing schooner the
crew of which were fortunate enough to escape by taking to the dories
and another a British bark which struck on the farthest bar and
was beaten to pieces by the great waves while the townspeople stood
helplessly watching from the shore for launching a boat in that surf
was impossible

The minister was one of those who watched News of the disaster had been
brought to the village by the lightkeepers assistant and Ellery and
most of the ablebodied men in town had tramped the three miles to the
beach facing the screaming wind and the cutting blasts of flying sand
As they came over the dunes there were times when they had to dig their
heels into the ground and bend forward to stand against the freezing
gale And as they drew nearer the thunder of the mighty surf grew ever
louder until they saw the white clouds of spray leap high above the
crazily tossing flapping bunches of beach grass that topped the last
knoll

Three masts and a broken bowsprit sticking slantwise up from a whirl of
creamy white that was all they could see of the bark at first glance
But occasionally as the breakers drew back for another cruel blow they
caught glimpses of the tilted deck smashed bare of houses and rail

Those black things on the masts asked Ellery bending to scream the
question into the ear of Gaius Winslow his companion Are theyit
cant be possible that theyre

Yup shrieked Gaius in reply theyre men Crew lashed in the
riggin Poor fellers itll soon be over for em And theyre most
likely frozen stiff aready and wont sense drownin thats a comfort

Men repeated the minister in horror Men Great God and are we
to stand by here and see them die without lifting a hand Why its
barbarous Its

Winslow seized his arm and pointed

Look he shouted Look at them How much good would our liftin hands
do against them

Ellery looked The undertow that second was sucking the beach dry
sucking with such force that gravel and small stones pattered down the
slope in showers And behind it a wave its ragged top raveled by the
wind into white streamers was piling up up up sheer and green and
mighty curling over now and descending with a hammer blow that shook
the land beneath their feet And back of it reared another and
another and another an eighth of a mile of whirling surging terrific
breakers with a yelling hurricane whipping them on

It was soon over as Gaius had said it would be A mighty leap of spray
a section of hull broken off and tossed into view for an instant then
two of the masts went down The other followed almost at once Then
the watchers most of them went back to the village saying little or
nothing and dispersing silently to their homes

During the next fortnight John Ellery conducted six funeral services
brief prayers beside the graves of unknown men from that wreck The
bodies as they were washed ashore were put into plain coffins paid
for by the board of selectmen and buried in the corner of the Regular
cemetery beside other waifs thrown up by the sea in other years It was
a sad experience for him but it was an experience and tended to make
him forget his own sorrow just a little Or if not to forget at least
to think of and sympathize more keenly with the sorrows of others
Somewhere in England or Ireland or scattered over the wide world there
were women and children waiting for these men waiting anxiously for
news of their safe arrival in port praying for them When he mentioned
this thought to the townspeople they nodded philosophically and said
yes they presumed likely As Captain Zeb put it Most sailors are
fools enough to get married probly this lot want any exception It
was no new thought to him or to any other dweller in that region It was
almost a fixed certainty that if you went to sea long enough you
were bound to be wrecked sometime or other The chances were that with
ordinary luck and good management you would escape with your life
Luck good or bad was the risk of the trade good management was
expected as a matter of course

Mr Pepper made no more calls at the parsonage and when the minister
met him at church or elsewhere seemed anxious to avoid an interview

Well Abishai asked Ellery on one of these occasions how are you
getting on at home Has your sister locked you up again

No sir she aint replied Kyan Laviny shes sort of diffrent
lately She aint nigh soso down on a feller as she used to be I can
get out once in a while by myself nowadays when she wants to write a
letter or somethin

Oh shes writing letters is she

Umhm Writes one about every once in a week I dont know who theyre
to nuther but I have my suspicions You see weve got a cousin out
Westout Pennsylvany wayand he aint very well and has got a turrible
lot of money Im sort of surmisin that Lavinys writin to him Were
about his only relations thats left alive andand so

I see The minister smiled

Yup Lavinys a pretty good navigator furs keepin an eye to windard
is concerned She was awful down on Phineasthats his namecause he
married a Philadelphy woman but hes a widower man now so I spose she
feels better toward him Shes talkin of goin up to Sandwich pretty
soon

She IS Alone

So she says

To leave you here Why well Im surprised

Godfreys mighty so be I But she says she blieves she needs a change
and theres church conference up there you know and she figgers that
she aint been to conference she dont know when I spose youll go
wont you Mr Ellery

Probably

Umhm I kind of wisht I was goin myself Twill be kind of lonesome
round home without her

Considering that that variety of lonesomeness had been Abishais dream
of paradise for years Ellery thought his change of heart a good joke
and told Keziah of it when he returned to the parsonage The housekeeper
was greatly surprised

Well well well she exclaimed Miraclesll never cease I dont
wonder so much at Laviny wantin to go to conference but her darin to
go and leave Kyan at home is past belief Why every time shes had
a cold her one fear was that shed die and leave Bish behind to be
kidnaped by some woman Kyan himself was sick once and the story was
that his sister set side of the bed night and day and read him over and
over again that chapter in the Bible that says theres no marryin or
givin in marriage in heaven Dr Parker told me that he didnt believe
Bish got haf the comfort out of that passage that she did And now
shes goin to Sandwich and leave him I cant think its true

But it was true and Lavinia got herself elected a delegate and went in
company with Captain Elkanah Mrs Mayo and others to the conference
She was a faithful attendant at the meetings and seemed to be having
a very good time She introduced the minister to one Caleb Pratt a
resident of Sandwich whom she said she had known ever since she was a
girl

Mr Pratts a cousin to Thankful Payne over to home volunteered
Lavinia You know Thankful Mr Ellery

Ellery did know Mrs Payne and said so Mr Pratt who was dressed in a
new suit of black which appeared to hurt him imparted the information
that hed heard tell considerble of Mr Ellery

I enjoyed your sermon tonight fustrate he added solemnly
Fustrate siryes

Did you indeed Im glad

Yes sir You used words in that sermon that I never heard afore in my
life Twas grand

Lavinia confided to her pastor that Mr Pratt made the best shoes in
Ostable County He could fit ANY kind of feet she declared and the
minister ought to try him sometime She added that he had money in the
bank

The Reverend John rode home in the stage beside Miss Annabel not from
choice but because the young ladys father insisted upon it Miss
Daniels gushed and enthused as she always did As they drove by the
Corners the minister who had been replying absently to Annabels
questions suddenly stopped short in the middle of a sentence His
companion leaning forward to look out of the window saw Grace Van
Horne entering the store For an instant Annabels face wore a very
unpleasant expression Then she smiled and said in her sweetest manner

Why theres the tavern girl I havent seen her for sometime How old
she looks I suppose her uncles death has aged her Well shell
be married soon just as soon as Capn Nat gets back They perfectly
worship each other those two They say she writes him the longest
letters Hannah Poundberry told me Hannahs a queer creature and
common but devoted to the Hammonds Mr Ellery However youre not
interested in ComeOuters are you Ha ha

Ellery made some sort of an answer but he could not have told what it
was The sight of Grace had brought back all that he was trying so
hard to forget Why couldnt one forget when it was so painfuland so
uselessto remember

Spring once more then summer And now people were again speaking of
Captain Nat Hammond His ship was overdue long overdue Even in those
days when there were no cables and the telegraph was still something of
a novelty word of his arrival should have reached Trumet months before
this But it had not come and did not Before the summer was over the
wise heads of the retired skippers were shaking dubiously Something had
happened to the Sea Mist something serious

As the weeks and months went by without news of the missing vessel
this belief became almost a certainty At the ComeOuter chapel where
Ezekiel Bassett now presided prayers were offered for the son of their
former leader These prayers were not as fervent as they might have
been for Graces nonattendance at meetings was causing much comment
and a good deal of resentment She came occasionally but not often I
always said she was stuckup and thought she was too good for the rest
of us remarked Sukey B spitefully And between you and me pa
says he thinks Nat Hammond would be one to uphold her in it He want a
bit spirituous and never experienced religion If anything HAS happened
to him its a punishment sent thats what pa thinks

Those were gloomy days at the parsonage Keziah said little concerning
the topic of which all the village was talking and John Ellery
forebore to mention it The housekeeper was as faithful as ever in the
performance of her household duties but her smile had gone and she
was worn and anxious The minister longed to express his sympathy but
Keziah had not mentioned Nats name for months not since he Ellery
gave her the message intrusted to him by the captain before sailing He
would have liked to ask about Grace for he knew Mrs Coffin visited the
Hammond home occasionally but this too he hesitated to do He heard
from others that the girl was bearing the suspense bravely that she
refused to give up hope and was winning the respect of all the thinking
class in Trumet by her courage and patience Even the most bigoted of
the Regulars Captain Daniels and his daughter excepted of course had
come to speak highly of her Shes a spunky girl declared Captain
Zeb with emphasis Theres nothing of the milksop and crybaby about
her Shes fit to be a sailors wife and I only hope Nats alive to
come back and marry her He was a durn good feller toosavin your
presence Mr Elleryand if he was forty times a ComeOuter Id say the
same thing Im fraid hes gone though poor chap As good a seaman
as he was would have fetched port afore this if he was atop of water
As for Gracie shes a brick and a lady every inch of her My old
girl went down tother day to call on her and thats the fust ComeOuter
shes been to see sence there was any Why dont you go see her too
Mr Ellery Twould be a welcome change from Zeke Bassett and his tribe
Go ahead it would be the Almightys own work and the societyd stand
back of you all them thats wuth considerin anyhow

This was surprising advice from a member of the Regular and was
indicative of the changed feeling in the community but the minister of
course could not take it He had plunged headlong into his church work
hoping that it and time would dull the pain of his terrible shock and
disappointment It had been dulled somewhat but it was still there and
every mention of her name revived it

One afternoon Keziah came into his study where he was laboring with his
next Sunday sermon and sat down in the rockingchair She had been out
and still wore her bonnet and shawl

John she said I ask your pardon for disturbin you I know youre
busy

Ellery laid down his pen Never too busy to talk with you Aunt
Keziah he observed What is it

I wanted to ask if you knew Mrs Prince was sick

No Is she Im awfully sorry Nothing serious I hope

No I guess not Only shes got a cold and is kind of under the
weather I thought praps youd like to run up and see her She thinks
the world and all of you cause you was so good when she was distressed
about her son Poor old thing shes had a hard time of it

I will go I ought to go of course Im glad you reminded me of it

Yes I told her you hadnt meant to neglect her but youd been busy
fussin with the fair and the like of that

That was all Ill go right away Have you been there today

No I just heard that she was ailin from Didama Rogers Didama said
she was all but dyin so I knew she probly had a little cold or
somethin If she was really very bad Di would have had her buried by
this time sos to be sure her news was ahead of anybody elses I aint
been up there but I met her tother mornin

Didama

No Mrs Prince Shed come down to see Grace

Oh

Yes The old ladys been awful kind and sympathizin sincesince
this new trouble It reminds her of the loss of her own boy I presume
likely and so she feels for Grace John what do they say around town
aboutabout HIM

Captain Hammond

Yes

The minister hesitated Keziah did not wait for him to answer

I see she said slowly Do they all feel that way

Why if you mean that theyve all given up hope I should hardly say
that Captain Mayo and Captain Daniels were speaking of it in my hearing
the other day and they agreed that there was still a chance

A pretty slim one though they callated didnt they

Well they werewere doubtful of course There was the possibility
that he had been wrecked somewhere and hadnt been picked up They cited
several such cases The South Pacific is full of islands where vessels
seldom touch and he and his crew may be on one of these

Yes They might but Im afraid not Ah hum

She rose and was turning away Ellery rose also and laid his hand on her
arm

Aunt Keziah he said Im very sorry I respected Captain Hammond in
spite ofofin spite of everything Ive tried to realize that he was
not to blame He was a good man and I havent forgotten that he saved my
life that morning on the flats And Im so sorry for YOU

She did not look at him

John she answered with a sigh sometimes I think youd better get
another housekeeper

What Are you going to leave me YOU

Oh twouldnt be because I wanted to But it seems almost as if there
was a kind of fate hangin over me and that she smiled faintly as if
twas sort of catchin as you might say Everybody I ever cared for has
had somethin happen to em My brother died mythe man I married went
to the dogs then you and Grace had to be miserable and I had to help
make you so I sent Nat away and he blamed me and

No no He didnt blame you He sent you word that he didnt

Yes but he did all the same He must have I should if Id been in
his place And now hes dead and wont ever understandon this earth
anyhow I guess Id better clear out and leave you afore I spoil your
life

Aunt Keziah youre my anchor to windward as they say down here If
I lost you goodness knows where I should drift Dont you ever talk of
leaving me again

Thank you John Im glad you want me to stay I wont leave yet
awhile neverunless I have to

Why should you ever have to

Well I dont know Yes I do know too John I had another letter
tother day

You did Fromfrom that man

Yup from For a moment it seemed as if she were about to pronounce
her husbands name something she had never done in his presence but if
she thought of it she changed her mind

From him she said He wanted money of course he always does But
that want the worst The letter was from England and in it he wrote
that he was gettin sick of knockin around and guessed hed be for
comin to the States pretty soon and huntin me up Said what was the
use of havin an ablebodied wife if she couldnt give her husband a
home

The scoundrel

Yes I know what he is maybe full as well as you do Thats why I
spoke of leavin you If that man comes to Trumet Ill go sure as
death

No no Aunt Keziah you must free yourself from him No power on earth
can compel you to longer support such a

None on earth no But its my punishment and Ive got to put up with
it I married him with my eyes wide open done it to spite thethe
other as much as anything and I must bear the burden But I tell you
this John if he comes here to this town where Ive been respected
and considered a decent woman if he comes here I gosomewhere
anywhere thatll be out of the sight of them that know me And wherever
I go he shant be with me THAT I wont stand Id rather die and I
hope I do Dont talk to me any more nowdont I cant stand it

She hurried out of the room Later as the minister passed through the
dining room on his way to the door she spoke to him again

John she said I didnt say what I meant to when I broke in on you
just now I meant to tell you about Grace I knew youd like to know and
wouldnt ask Shes bearin up well poor girl She thought the world of
Nat even though she might not have loved him in the way that

Whats that What are you saying Aunt Keziah

I meanwell I mean that hed always been like an own brother to her
and she cared a lot for him

But you said she didnt love him

Did I That was a slip of the tongue maybe But she bears it well and
I dont think she gives up hope I try not to for her sake and I try
not to show her how I feel

She sewed vigorously for a few moments Then she said

Shes goin away Gracie is

Going away

Yup Shes goin to stay with a relation of the Hammonds over in
Connecticut for a spell I coaxed her into it Stayin here at home
with all this suspense and with Hannah Poundberrys tongue droppin
lamentations like kernels out of a corn sheller is enough to kill a
healthy batch of kittens with nine lives apiece She didnt want to go
felt that she must stay here and wait for news but I told her wed get
news to her as soon as it come and shes goin

Ellery took his hat from the peg and opened the door His foot was on
the step when Keziah spoke again

Sheit dont mean nothin John except that she aint so hardhearted
as maybe you might thinkshes asked me about you most every time Ive
been there She told me to take good care of you

The door closed Keziah put down her sewing and listened as the
ministers step sounded on the walk She rose went to the window
and looked after him She was wondering if she had made a mistake in
mentioning Graces name She had meant to cheer him with the thought
that he was not entirely forgotten that he was at least pitied but
perhaps it would have been better to have remained silent Her gaze
shifted and she looked out over the bay blue and white in the sun and
wind When she was a girl the sea had been kind to her it had brought
her father home safe and those homecomings were her pleasantest
memories But she now hated it It was cruel and cold and wicked It had
taken the man she loved and would have loved till she died even though
he could never have been hers and she had given him to another it had
taken him killed him cruelly perhaps And now it might be bringing to
her the one who was responsible for all her sorrow the one she could
not think of without a shudder She clung to the window sash and prayed
aloud

Lord Lord she pleaded dont put any more on me now I couldnt
stand it I couldnt

Ellery too was thinking deeply as he walked up the main road on his
way to Mrs Princes Keziahs words were repeating themselves over and
over in his brain She had asked about him She had not forgotten him
altogether And what did the housekeeper mean by saying that she had
not loved Captain Hammond in the way thatNot that it could make any
difference Nothing could give him back his happiness But what did it
mean

Mrs Prince was very glad to see him He found her in the big armchair
with the quilted back and the projecting wings at each side of her
head She was wrapped in a Rising Sun quilt which was a patchwork
glory of red and crimson A young girl a neighbor who was apparently
acting in the dual capacity of nurse and housekeeper admitted him to
the old ladys presence

Well well she exclaimed delightedly Then you aint forgot me
altogether Im awful glad to see you Youll excuse me for not gettin
up my backs got more pains in it than there is bones a good sight
Dr Parker says its nothin serious and all I had to do was set still
and take his medicine I told him that either the aches or the medicine
made settin still serious enough and when your only amusement is
listenin to Emeline Berryshes the girl thats takin care of
mewhen your only fun is listenin to Emeline drop your best dishes in
the kitchen sink its pretty nigh tragic There there dont mind an
old woman Mr Ellery Set down and lets talk Its a comfort to be
able to say somethin besides Dont Emeline and Be sure you pick up
all the pieces

Mrs Princes good spirits were of short duration Her conversation soon
shifted to the loss of her son and she wept using the corner of the
quilt to wipe away her tears Eddie had been her idol and as she
said it was hard to believe what folks kept tellin her that it was
Gods will and therefore all for the best

Thats so easy to say she sobbed Maybe it is best for the Lord
but how about me I needed him more than they did up there or I think I
did O Mr Ellery I dont mean to be irreverent but WHY was it all for
the best

Questions like this are hard to answer The young minister tried but
the answers were unsatisfactory even to him

And theres Nat Hammond continued Mrs Prince A fine manno better
anywhere even though his father was a ComeOuterjust goin to
be married and all now they say hes drownedwhy Why was that
necessary

Ellery could not reply The old lady did not wait for him to do so The
mention of Captain Nats name reminded her of other things

Poor Gracie she said Its turrible hard on her I went down to see
her two or three times afore I was took with this backache Shes an
awful nice girl And pretty as a pink too Dont you think so Hey
dont you

Yes

Yes Ive been kind of expectin she might get up to see me Hannah
Poundberry told the Berrys that she said she was comin I dont care
about her bein a ComeOuter I aint proud Mr Ellery And theres
ComeOuters and COMEOuters Proud Lord a mercy what has an old
woman next door to the poorhouse got to be proud over Yes she told
Hannah she was comin and the Berry folks thought it might be today
So Ive been watchin for her What you aint agoin Mr Ellery

I think I must Mrs Prince

Oh dont Do stay a spell longer Gracie might come and Id like
for you to meet her She needs sympathy and comfort an awful lot and
theres no tellin you might convert her to bein a Reglar Oh yes
you might Youve got the most persuadin way everybody says so And
you dont know her very well do you Land sakes alive talk about
angels I snum if she aint comin up the road this blessed minute

John Ellery had risen Now he seized his hat and moved hastily toward
the door Mrs Prince called to him to remain but he would not
However her goodbys delayed him for a minute and before he reached
the yard gate Grace was opening it They were face to face for the first
time since they had parted in the grove so many months before

She was thinner and paler he saw that And dressed very quietly in
black She looked at him as he stood before her in the path and her
cheeks flushed and her eyes fell He stepped aside and raised his hat

She bowed gravely and murmured a Good afternoon Then she passed on up
the path toward the door He watched her for an instant and then stepped
quickly after her The black gown and the tired look in her eyes touched
him to the heart He could not let her go without a word

She turned at the sound of his step behind her

ErMiss Van Horne he stammered I merely wanted to tell you how
deeply Iwe all feel for you in your trouble III am so sorry

Thank you she said simply and after a moments hesitation

I mean it sincerely II did not know Captain Hammond very well but
I respected and liked him the first time we met I shall hope
thatthatit is not so serious as they fear

Thank you she said again We are all hoping

Yes II It was dreadfully hard to get words together I have
heard so much of the captain from

From Aunt Keziah Yes she was Nats warmest friend

I know ErMrs Coffin tells me you are going away I hope you may
hear good news and soon I shall think of youof himI want you to
understand that I shall

The door opened and Emeline Berry appeared on the threshold

Come right in Grace she called Mrs Prince wants you to Shes
ahollerin for you to hurry up

Goodby said the minister

Goodby Thank you again It was very kind of you to say this

No no I mean it

I know that was why it was so kind Goodby

She held out her hand and he took it He knew that his was trembling
but so too was hers The hands fell apart Grace entered the house and
John Ellery went out at the gate

That night Keziah in the sitting room trying to read but finding
it hard to keep her mind on the book heard her parson pacing back and
forth over the strawmatted floor of his chamber She looked at
the clock it was nearly twelve She shut the book and sighed Her
wellmeant words of consolation had been a mistake after all She
should not have spoken Grace Van Hornes name


CHAPTER XVI

IN WHICH THE MINISTER BOARDS THE SAN JOSE


Hey Mr Ellery

It was Captain Zeb Mayo who was calling The captain sat in his antique
chaise drawn by the antique white horse and was hailing the parsonage
through a speaking trumpet formed by holding both his big hands before
his mouth The reins he had tucked between the edge of the dashboard and
the whip socket If he had thrown them on the ground he would still have
been perfectly safe with that horse

Mr Ellery ahoy roared Captain Zeb through his hands

The window of Zoeth Peterss house next door to the Regular church
was thrown up and Mrs Peterss head bound with a blueandwhite
handkerchief in lieu of a sweeping cap was thrust forth into the crisp
March air

What is it Capn Mayo screamed Mrs Peters Hey

Hey repeated Captain Zeb peering round the chaise curtain Whos
that

Its me Is somebody dead

Whos me Oh No Hettie nobodys dead though Im likely to bust a
blood vessel if I keep on yellin much longer Is the parson to home

Hey

Oh heavens alive I say isHa there you be Mr Ellery Mornin
Keziah

The minister and Mrs Coffin the former with a napkin in his hand had
emerged from the side door of the parsonage and now came hurrying down
to the gate

Land of Goshen exclaimed the captain you dont mean to tell me
you aint done breakfast yet and it after seven oclock Why were
thinkin about dinner up to our house

Keziah answered Yes she said I shouldnt wonder Your wife tells
me Zeb that the only time you aint thinkin about dinner is when you
think of breakfast or supper We aint so hungry here that we get up
to eat in the middle of the night Whats the matter Hettie Peters is
hollerin at you did you know it

Did I know it Tut tut tut Id known it if I was a mile away less
I was paralyzed in my ears Let her holler twill do her good and keep
her in practice for ComeOuter meetin Why Mr Ellery I tell you
Emlous Sparrow the fish peddler stepped up to our house a few minutes
ago Hes just come down from the shanties over on the shore by the
lightwhere the wreck was you knowand he says theres a morphrodite
brig anchored three or four mile off and shes flyin colors haf mast
and union down Theyre gettin a boats crew together to go off to
her and see whats the row Im goin to drive over and I thought maybe
youd like to go along I told the old ladymy wife I meanthat I
thought of pickin you up and she said twas a good idee Said my likin
to cruise with a parson in my old age was either a sign that I was
hopeful or fearful she didnt know which and either way it ought to be
encouraged He he he What do you say Mr Ellery Want to go

The minister hesitated Id like to he said Id like to very much
But I ought to work on my sermon this morning

Keziah cut in here Cats foot she sniffed Let your sermon go for
this once do If it aint long enough as it is you can begin again
when youve got to the end and preach it over again Didama Rogers said
last circle day that she could set still and hear you preach right over
n over Id give her a chance specially if it did keep her still
Keepin Didama still is good Christian work aint it Zeb

Captain Mayo slapped his knee He he he he chuckled Callate
youre right Keziah

Indeed I am I believe it would be Christianity and I KNOW twould be
work There there run in and get your coat and hat Mr Ellery Ill
step across and ease Hetties mind andand lungs

She went across the road to impart the news of the vessel in distress to
the curious Mrs Peters A moment later the minister having donned
his hat and coat ran down the walk and climbed into the chaise beside
Captain Zeb The white horse stimulated into a creaky jog trot by
repeated slappings of the reins and roars to Get under way and Cast
off moved along the sandy lane

During the drive the captain and his passenger discussed various topics
of local interest among them Captain Nat Hammond and the manner in
which he might have lost his ship and his life It was now taken for
granted in Trumet and elsewhere that Nat was dead and would never be
heard from again The owners had given up so Captain Zeb said and
went on to enumerate the various accidents which might have
happenedtyphoons waterspouts fires and even attacks by Malay
piratesthough added the captain Genrally speakin Id ruther not
bet on any pirate gettin away with Nat Hammonds ship if the skipper
was alive and healthy Then theres mutiny and fevers and collisions
and land knows what all And speakin of trouble what do you callate
ails that craft were goin to look at now

They found a group on the beach discussing that very question A few
fishermen one or two lobstermen and wreckers and the lightkeeper were
gathered on the knoll by the lighthouse They had a spyglass and a
goodsized dory was ready for launching

Where is she Noah asked Captain Zeb of the lightkeeper That her
off back of the spar buoy Let me have a squint through that glass
my eyes aint what they used to be when I could see a whale spout two
miles tother side of the sky line and tell how many barrels of ile hed
try out fust look Takes practice to keep your eyesight sos you can
see round a curve like that he added winking at Ellery

Shes a brigantine Zeb observed the keeper handing up the spyglass
And flyin the British colors Looks if she might be one of them salt
boats from Turks Islands But what shes doin out there anchored
with canvas lowered and showin distress signals in fair weather like
this is moren any of us can make out She want there last evenin
though and she is there now

She aint the only funny thing along shore this mornin nuther
announced Theophilus Black one of the fishermen Charlie Burgess just
come down along and he says theres a ships longboat hauled up on the
beach bout a mile n a half tother side the mouth of the herrin
crick yonder Oars in her and all And she aint no boat that blongs
round here is she Charlie

No Thoph she aint was the reply Make anything out of her
capn

Captain Zeb who had been inspecting the anchored vessel through
the spyglass lowered the latter and seemed puzzled Not much he
answered Blessed if she dont look abandoned to me Cant see a sign
of life aboard her

We couldnt neither said Thoph We was just callatin to go off to
her when Charlie come and told us about the longboat I guess likely we
can go now its pretty nigh smooth as a pond Youll take an oar wont
you Noah

I cant leave the light very well My wife went over to the village
last night You and Charlie and Bill go Want to go too Zeb

No Ill stay here I guess The old lady made me promise to keep my
feet dry afore I left the house

You want to go Mr Ellery Lots of room

The minister was tempted The sea always had a fascination for him and
the mystery of the strange ship was appealing

Sure I wont be in the way

No no course you wont said Burgess Come right along You set in
the bow if you dont mind gettin sprinkled once in a while Ill steer
and Thoph and Billll row Thatll be enough for one dory If we need
more well signal Heave ahead

The surf though low for that season of the year looked dangerous to
Ellery but his companions launched the dory with the ease which comes
of experience Burgess took the steering oar and Thoph and Bill the
latter a lobsterman from Wellmouth Neck bent their broad backs for the
long pull The statement concerning the pondlike smoothness of the sea
was something of an exaggeration The dory climbed wave after wave long
and green and oily at the top of each she poised tipped and slid down
the slope The minister curled up in the bow on a rather uncomfortable
cushion of anchor and roding caught glimpses of the receding shore over
the crests behind One minute he looked down into the face of Burgess
holding the steering oar in place the next the stern was high above him
and he felt that he was reclining on the back of his neck But always
the shoulders of the rowers moved steadily in the short deep strokes
of the rough water oarsman and the beach with the white light and
redroofed house of the keeper the group beside it and Captain Zebs
horse and chaise grew smaller and less distinct

Humph grunted Charlie

Whats the matter asked Thoph

The steersman who was staring hard in the direction they were going
scowled

Humph he grunted again I swan to man fellers I believe she IS
abandoned

Rubbish panted Bill twisting his neck to look over his shoulder
Course she aint Whod abandon a craft such weathers this and
Provincetown harbor only three hours run or so

When it comes to that commented Burgess why should they anchor off
here stead of takin her in by the inlet If theres anybody aboard
they aint showed themselves yet She might have been leakin but she
dont look it Sets up out of water pretty well Well well know in a
few minutes Hit her up boys

The rowers hit her up and the dory moved faster Then Burgess putting
his hand to his mouth hailed

Ship ahoy he roared Ahoy

No reply

Ahoy the brig bellowed Burgess Whats the matter aboard there All
hands asleep

Still no answer Thoph and Bill pulled more slowly now Burgess nodded
to them

Stand by he ordered Easy Way enough Let her run

The dory slackened speed turned in obedience to the steering oar and
slid under the forequarter of the anchored vessel Ellery looking up
saw her name in battered gilt letters above his headthe San Jose

Stand by Thoph shouted Charlie Spose you can jump and grab her
forechains Hold her steady Bill Now Thoph Thats the time

Thoph had jumped seized the chains and was scrambling aboard A moment
later he appeared at the rail amidships a rope in his hand The dory
was brought alongside and made fast then one after the other the men in
the boat climbed to the brigs deck

Ahoy yelled Burgess All hands on deck tumble up you lubbers
Humph She is abandoned sure and sartin

Yup assented Bill Her boats are gone See Guess that explains the
longboat on the beach Charlie

Callate it does but it dont explain why they left her She aint
leakin none to speak of thats sure Ridess lights a feather
Christmas look at them decks dirty hogs whoever they was

The decks were dirty and the sails sloppily furled were dirty
likewise The brig as she rolled and jerked at her anchor rope was
dirtyand unkempt from stem to stern To Ellerys mind she made a
lonesome picture even under the clear winter sky and bright sunshine

Thoph led the way aft The cabin companion door was open and they peered
down

Phew sniffed Burgess She aint no cologne bottle is she Well
come on below and lets see whatll we see

The cabin was a mess as Bill expressed it The floor was covered
with scattered heaps of riffraff oilskins coats empty bottles and
papers On the table a box stood its hinged lid thrown back

Medicine chest said Burgess examining it And rum bottles aplenty
Somebodys been sick I shouldnt wonder

The minister opened the door of one of the little staterooms The light
which shone through the dirty and tightly closed bullseye window
showed a tumbled bunk the blankets soiled and streaked The smell was
stifling

Say fellers whispered Thoph I dont like this much myself Im for
gettin on deck where the airs better Somethins happened aboard this
craft somethin serious

Charlie and Bill nodded an emphatic affirmative

Hadnt we better look about a little more asked Ellery Theres
another stateroom there

He opened the door of it as he spoke It was if possible in a worse
condition than the first And the odor was even more overpowering

Skippers room observed Burgess peeping in And that bunk aint
been slept in for weeks See the mildew on them clothes Phew Im fair
sick to my stomach Come out of this

On deck in the sunlight they held another consultation

Queerest business ever I see observed Charlie I never

I see somethin like it once interrupted Bill Down in the Gulf
twas I was on the old Fishhawk Eben Salterss dad from over to
Bayport skippered her We picked up a West Injy schooner derelict
abandoned same as this one but not anchored of course Yeller jack was
the trouble aboard her andWhere you bound Thoph

Goin to take a squint at the focastle replied Theophilus moving
forward The minister followed him

The focastle hatchway was black and grim Ellery knelt and peered down
Here there was practically no light at all and the air was fouler than
that in the cabin

See anything Mr Ellery asked Thoph looking over his shoulder

No I dont see anything But I thought

He seemed to be listening

What did you think

Nothing I

Hold on you aint goin down there be you I wouldnt No tellin
what you might find Well all right I aint curious Ill stay up here
and you can report

He stepped over and leaned against the rail Bill came across the deck
and joined him

Wheres Charlie asked Thoph

Gone back to the cabin was the answer Thought likely he might find
some of her papers or somethin to put us on the track I told him to
heave ahead I didnt want no part of it Too much like that yellerjack
schooner to suit me Whats become of the parson

Thoph pointed to the open hatch

Down yonder explorin the focastle he replied He can have the
job for all me Phew Say Bill what IS this weve struck anyhow

Ellery descended the almost perpendicular ladder gingerly holding on
with both hands At its foot he stopped and tried to accustom his eyes
to the darkness

A room perhaps ten feet long so much he could make out The floor
strewn like that of the cabin with heaps of clothing and odds and
ends More shapes of clothes hanging up and swaying with the roll of the
brig A little window high up at the end black with dirt And cavities
bunks in rows along the walls A horrible hole

He took a step toward the center of the room bending his head to
avoid hitting the focastle lantern Then in one of the bunks something
stirred something alive He started violently controlled himself with
an effort and stumbled toward the sound

What is it he whispered Who is it Is anyone there

A groan answered him Then a voice weak and quavering said

Gimme a drink Gimme a drink Cant none of you Godforsaken devils
give me a drink

He stooped over the bunk A man was lying in it crumpled into a
dreadful heap He stooped lower looked and saw the mans face

There was a shout from the deck or rather a yell Then more yells and
the sound of running feet

Mr Ellery screamed Burgess at the hatchway Mr Ellery for the
Almightys sake come up here Come out of that this minute Quick

The minister knew what was coming was sure of it as he stepped to the
foot of the ladder had known it the instant he saw that face

Mr Ellery shrieked Burgess Mr Ellery are you there

Yes Im here answered the minister slowly He was fighting with all
his might to keep his nerves under control His impulse was to leap
up those steps rush across that deck spring into the dory and row
anywhere to get away from the horror of that forecastle

Come up called Burgess Hurry Its the smallpox The darned
hookers rotten with it For God sakes come quick

He ran to the rail yelling order to Bill and Thoph who were
frantically busy with the dory Ellery began to climb the ladder His
head emerged into the clean sweet air blowing across the deck He drew
a breath to the very bottom of his lungs

Then from behind and below him came the voice again

Gimme a drink it wailed Gimme a drink of water Aint one of you
cussed swabs got decency enough to fetch me a drink Im dyin for a
drink I tell you Im dyin

The minister stood still his feet on the ladder The three men by the
rail were working like mad their faces livid under the sunburn and
their hands trembling They pushed each other about and swore They were
not cowards either Ellery knew them well enough to know that Burgess
had that very winter pulled a skiff through broken ice in the face
of a wicked notheaster to rescue an old neighbor whose dory had been
capsized in the bay while he was hauling lobster pots But now Burgess
was as scared as the rest

Thoph and Bill sprang over the rail into the boat Burgess turned and
beckoned to Ellery

Come on he called What are you waitin for

The minister remained where he was

Are you sure he faltered

Sure Blast it all I found the log It aint been kept for a fortnit
but theres enough Its smallpox I tell you Two men died of it three
weeks ago The skipper died right afterwards The mateNo wonder them
that was left run away as soon as they sighted land Come on Do you
want to die too

From the poison pit at the foot of the ladder the man in the bunk called
once more

Water he screeched Water Are you goin to leave me you dn
cowards

For Heaven sakes cried Burgess clutching the rail whats that

Ellery answered him Its one of them he said and his voice sounded
odd in his own ears Its one of the crew

One of theDown THERE Has he

Yes he has

Help help screamed the voice shrilly Are you goin to leave me to
die all alone Heelp

The minister turned Hush he called in answer to the voice hush
Ill bring you water in a minute Burgess he added you and the rest
go ashore I shall stay

Youll stay Youll STAY With THAT Youre crazy as a loon Dont be
a fool man Come on Well send the doctor and somebody elsesome one
thats had it maybe or aint afraid I am and Im goin Dont be a
fool

Thoph from the dory shouted to know what was the matter Ellery
climbed the ladder to the deck and walked over to the rail As he
approached Burgess fell back a few feet

Thoph said the minister addressing the pair in the dory there is
a sick man down in the forecastle He has been alone there for hours
I suppose certainly since his shipmates ran away If he is left longer
without help he will surely die Some one must stay with him You and
the rest row ashore and get the doctor and whoever else you can Ill
stay here till they come

Thoph and his companions set up a storm of protest It was foolish it
was crazy the man would die anyhow and so on They begged the minister
to come with them But he was firm

Dont stop to argue he urged Hurry and get the doctor

Come on Charlie ordered Bill No use talkin to him hes set Come
on I wont stay alongside this craft another minute for nobody If you
be comin come

Burgess still protesting clambered over the rail The dory swung clear
of the brig The rowers settled themselves for the stroke

Better change your mind Mr Ellery pleaded Charlie I hate to leave
you this way It seems mean but Im a married man with children like
the rest of us here and I cant take no risks Better come too No
Well well send help quick as the Lordll let us By the Almighty he
added in a sudden burst youve got more spunk than I haveyes or
anybody I ever come across Ill say that for you if you are a parson
Give way fellers

The oars dipped bent and the dory moved off The sound of the creaking
thole pins shot a chill through Ellerys veins His knees shook and
involuntarily a cry for them to come back rose to his lips But he
choked it down and waved his hand in farewell Then not trusting
himself to look longer at the receding boat he turned on his heel and
walked toward the forecastle

The water butts stood amidships not far from the open door of the
galley Entering the latter he found an empty saucepan This he filled
from the cask and then with it in his hand turned toward the black
hatchway Here was the greatest test of his courage To descend that
ladder approach that bunk and touch the terrible creature in it these
were the tasks he had set himself to do but could he

Vaccination in those days was by no means the universal custom that it
now is And smallpox even now is a disease the name of which strikes
panic to a community The minister had been vaccinated when he was a
child but that wasso it seemed to hima very long time ago And
that forecastle was so saturated with the plague that to enter it meant
almost certain infection He had stayed aboard the brig because the
pitiful call for help had made leaving a cowardly impossibility Now
face to face and in cold blood with the alternative it seemed neither
so cowardly or impossible The man would die anyhow so Thoph had said
was there any good reason why he should risk dying too and dying in
that way

He thought of a great many things and of many people as he stood by the
hatchway waiting among others he thought of his housekeeper
Keziah Coffin And somehow the thought of her of her pluck and her
selfsacrifice were the very inspirations he needed Its the duty
thats been laid on me Keziah had said and its a hard one but I
dont run away from it He began to descend the ladder

The sick man was raving in delirium when he reached him but the sound
of the water lapping the sides of the saucepan brought him to himself
He seized Ellery by the arm and drank and drank When at last he
desisted the pan was half empty

The minister laid him gently back in the bunk and stepped to the foot of
the ladder for breath This made him think of the necessity for air in
the place and he remembered the little window It was tightly closed
and rusted fast He went up to the deck found a marlin spike and
returning broke the glass A sharp cold draught swept through the
forecastle stirring the garments hanging on the nails

An hour later two dories bumped against the side of the San Jose Men
talking in low tones climbed over the rail Burgess was one of them
ashamed of his panic he had returned to assist the others in bringing
the brigantine into a safer anchorage by the inlet

Dr Parker very grave but businesslike reached the deck among the
first

Mr Ellery he shouted where are you

The ministers head and shoulders appeared at the forecastle companion
Here I am doctor he said Will you come down

The doctor made no answer in words but he hurried briskly across the
deck One man Ebenezer Capen an old fisherman and exwhaler from
East Trumet started to follow him but he was the only one The others
waited with scared faces by the rail

Get her under way and inshore as soon as you can ordered Dr Parker
Ebenezer you can help If I need you below Ill call

The minister backed down the ladder and the doctor followed him Parker
bent over the bunk for a few moments in silence

Hes pretty bad he muttered Mighty little chance Heavens what a
den Who broke that window

I did replied Ellery The air down here was dreadful

The doctor nodded approvingly I guess so he said Its bad enough
now Weve got to get this poor fellow out of here as soon as we can or
hell die before tomorrow Mr Ellery he added sharply what made
you do this Dont you realize the risk youve run

Some one had to do it You are running the same risk

Not just the same and besides its my business Why didnt you let
some one else some one we could spareHumph Confound it man didnt
you know any better Werent you afraid

His tone rasped Ellerys shaken nerves

Of course I was he snapped irritably Im not an idiot

Humph Well all right I beg your pardon But you oughtnt to have
done it Now youll have to be quarantined And who in thunder I can get
to stay with me in this case is more than I know Just say smallpox to
this town and it goes to pieces like a smashed egg Old Eb Capen will
help for hes had it but it needs more than one

Where are you going to takehim pointing to the moaning occupant of
the bunk

To one of the empty fish shanties on the beach There are beds there
such as they are and the place is secluded We can burn it down when
the fuss is over

Then why cant I stay I shall have to be quarantined I know that Let
me be the other nurse Why should anyone else run the risk I HAVE run
it Ill stay

Dr Parker looked at him Well he exclaimed Well I must say young
man that youve gotHumph All right Mr Ellery Im much obliged


CHAPTER XVII

IN WHICH EBENEZER CAPEN IS SURPRISED


Before sunset that afternoon the San Jose was anchored behind the point
by the inlet The fishing boats changed moorings and moved farther
up for not a single one of their owners would trust himself within a
hundred yards of the stricken brigantine As soon as the anchors were
dropped the volunteer crew was over side and away each of its members
to receive a scolding from his family for taking such a risk and to have
his garments sulphursmoked or buried Charlie Burgess whose wife was
something of a Tartar observed ruefully that he didnt take no comfort
round home nowadays between the smell of brimstone and the jawins
twas the hereafter ahead of time

The largest of the beach shanties one which stood by itself a quarter
of a mile from the light was hurriedly prepared for use as a pesthouse
and the sick sailor was carried there on an improvised stretcher
Dr Parker and Ellery lifted him from his berth and assisted by old
Ebenezer Capen got him up to the deck and lowered him into the dory
Ebenezer rowed the trio to the beach and the rest of the journey was
comparatively easy

The shanty had three rooms one of which was given up to the patient
one used as a living room and in the third Capen and the minister
were to sleep Mattresses were procured kindhearted and sympathizing
townspeople donated castoff tables and chairs and the building was
made as comfortable as it could be under the circumstances Sign
boards warning strangers to keep away were erected and in addition
to them the Trumet selectmen ordered ropes stretched across the lane on
both sides of the shanty But ropes and signs were superfluous Trumet
in general was in a blue funk and had no desire to approach within a
mile of the locality Even the driver of the grocery cart when he left
the days supply of provisions pushed the packages under the ropes
yelled a hurried Here you be and whipping up his horse departed at
a rattling gallop

The village sat up nights to discuss the affair and every day brought
a new sensation The survivors of the San Joses crew a wretched
panicstricken quartette of mulattos and Portuguese were apprehended
on the outskirts of Denboro the town below Trumet on the bay side
and were promptly sequestered and fumigated pending shipment to the
hospital at Boston Their story was short but grewsome The brigantine
was not a Turks Islands boat but a coaster from Jamaica She had sailed
with a small cargo for Savannah Two days out and the smallpox made its
appearance on board The sufferer a negro foremast hand died Then
another sailor was seized and also died The skipper who was the owner
was the next victim and the vessel was in a state of demoralization
which the mate an Englishman named Bradford could not overcome Then
followed days and nights of calm and terrible heat of pestilence
and all but mutiny The mate himself died There was no one left who
understood navigation At last came a southeast gale and the San Jose
drove before it Fair weather found her abreast the Cape The survivors
ran her in after dark anchored and reached shore in the longboat The
sick man whom they had left in the forecastle was a new hand who had
shipped at Kingston His name was Murphy they believed They had left
him because he was sure to die like the others and besides they knew
some one would see the distress signals and investigate That was all
yes Santa Maria was it not enough

This tale was a delicious tidbit for Didama and the daily advertisers
but after all it was a mere side dish compared to Mr Ellerys
astonishing behavior That he the minister of the Regular church
should risk his life risk dying of the smallpox to help a stranger
and a common sailor was incomprehensible Didama at least could not
understand it and said so My soul and body she exclaimed with
uplifted hands I wouldnt go nigh my own grandfather if he had the
smallpox let alone settin up with a strange critter that I didnt
know from Adams cat And a minister doin it He ought to consider the
congregation if he done nothin else Aint we more important than a
common water rat that even when hes dyin swears so I hear tell
like a ships poll parrot I never heard of such foolishness It beats
ME

It beat a good many who like the Widow Rogers could not understand
selfsacrifice But there were more and they the majority of Trumets
intelligent people who understood and appreciated Dr Parker a man
with a reputation for dangerously liberal views concerning religious
matters and an infrequent attendant at church was enthusiastic and
prodigal of praise

By George vowed the doctor Thats MY kind of Christianity Thats
the kind of parson I can tie to Im for John Ellery after this first
last and all the time And if he dont get the smallpox and die and
if he does live to preach in the Regular church youll see me in one of
the front pews every Sunday Thats what I think of him Everybody else
ran away and I dont blame em much But he stayed Yes sir by George
he stayed Somebody had to do it says he I take off my hat to that
young fellow

Captain Zeb Mayo went about cheering for his parson Mrs Mayo cooked
delicacies to be pushed under the ropes for the ministers consumption
The parish committee at a special session voted an increase of salary
and ordered a weekly service of prayer for the safe delivery of their
young leader from danger Even Captain Elkanah did not try to oppose
the general opinion although I cannot but feel he said that Mr
Ellerys course was rash and that he should have considered us and our
interest in his welfare before

Dum it all roared Captain Zeb jumping to his feet and interrupting
he didnt consider himself did he and aint he as important TO
himself as you Elkanah Daniels or anybody else in this meetin house
Bah dont lets have no more talk like that or Ill say somethin that
wont be fit to put in the minutes

Even at ComeOuters meeting when Ezekiel Bassett hinted at a just
punishment fallin on the head of the leader of the Pharisees Thoph
Black rose and defended Ellery

Keziah Coffin was perhaps the one person most disturbed by her
parsons heroism She would have gone to the shanty immediately had not
Dr Parker prevented Even as it was she did go as far as the ropes
but there she was warded off by Ebenezer until Ellery came running out
and bade her come no nearer

But you shant stay here Mr Ellery vowed Keziah Or if you do
Ill stay too I aint afraid of smallpox

I am confessed the minister and Im not going to let anyone I care
for expose themselves to it unnecessarily If you try to come in here I
shallhe smiledwell Capen and I will put you off the premises by
force There

Keziah smiled too in spite of herself Maybe youd have your hands
full she said O John what in the world made you do this thing Its
dreadful I shant sleep a wink thinkin of you I just must come here
and help

No you mustnt You can come as far as thethe dead line once in
a while if Captain Mayo will drive you over but thats all Im all
right Dont worry about me Im feeling tiptop and Im not going to be
sick Now go home and make me some of thatsome of those puddings of
yours We can use them to advantage cant we Capen

Bet yer replied Ebenezer with enthusiasm Keziah after more
expostulation went back to the parsonage where the puddings were made
and seasoned with tears and fervent prayers She wrote to Grace and told
her the news of the San Jose but she said nothing of the ministers
part in it Poor thing sighed Keziah shes bearin enough already
Her back aint as strong as mine maybe and mines most crackin Well
let it crack for good and all I dont know but thats the easiest way
out

The sick sailor grew no better Days and nights passed and he raved
and moaned or lay in a stupor Ebenezer acted as day nurse while Ellery
slept and at night the minister being younger went on watch The
doctor came frequently but said there was no hope A question of time
only and a short time he said

Capen occupied his mind with speculations concerning the patient

Do you know parson he said seems if Id seen the feller
somewheres afore Course I never have but when I used to go whalin
vyages I cruised from one end of creation to tother pretty nigh
and I MIGHT have met him However his own folks wouldnt know him now
would they so I callate Im just gettin foolish in my old age Said
his names Murphy them hafbreeds did didnt they I know bettern
that

How do you know asked Ellery idly listening

Cause when hes floppin round on the bed out of his head he sings
out all kinds of stuff A good deal of its plain cussin but theres
times when he talks respectable and once I heard him say darn and
another time I callate Now no Irishman says THAT Thats Yankee
that is

Well he ought to know his own name

Probly he doesor used tobut most likely he dont want nobody else
to know it Thats why he said twas Murphy and bein as he DID say it
I know taint it See my argument dont you Mr Ellery

Yes I guess so

Umhm Why land sakes names dont mean nothin with seafarin men
Ive seen the time when I had more namesHumph Looks kind of squally
off to the eastard dont it

That night the sick man was much worse His ravings were incessant The
minister sitting in his chair in the living room by the cook stove
could hear the steady stream of shouts oaths and muttered fragments of
dialogue with imaginary persons Sympathy for the sufferer he felt
of course and yet he as well as Dr Parker and old Capen had heard
enough to realize that the world would be none the worse for losing this
particular specimen of humanity The fellow had undoubtedly lived a hard
life among the roughest of companions afloat and ashore Even Ebenezer
who by his own confession was far from being a saint exclaimed
disgustedly at the close of a days watching by the sick bed Phew I
feels if Id been visiting states prison Let me set out doors a spell
and listen to the surf Its clean anyhow and that critters talk
makes me want to give my brains a bath

The wooden clock loaned by Mrs Parker the doctors wife ticked
steadily although a half hour slow Ellery glancing at it to see if
the time had come for giving medicine suddenly noticed how loud its
ticking sounded Wondering at this he was aware there was no other
sound in the house He rose and looked in at the door of the adjoining
room The patient had ceased to rave and was lying quiet on the bed

The minister tiptoed over to look at him And as he did so the man
opened his eyes

Halloo he said faintly Who are you

Ellery startled made no answer

Who are you demanded the man again Then with an oath he repeated
the question adding What place is this This aint the focastle
Where am I

Youre ashore Youve been sick Dont try to move

Sick Humph Sick Course I been sick Dont I know it The dn
cowards run off and left me blast their eyes Ill fix em for it one
of these days you hear

Sshh

Hush up yourself Where am I

Youre ashore On Cape Cod At Trumet

Trumet TRUMET

He was struggling to raise himself on his elbow Ellery was obliged to
use force to hold him down

Hush hush pleaded the minister you mustnt try to

Trumet I aint Youre lyin Trumet Good God Who brought me here
Did sheIs she

He struggled again Then his strength and his reason left him
simultaneously and the delirium returned He began to shout a name a
name that caused Ellery to stand upright and step back from the bed
scarcely believing his ears

All the rest of that night the man on the bed raved and muttered but of
people and places and happenings which he had not mentioned before And
the minister listening intently to every word caught himself wondering
if he also was not losing his mind

When the morning came Ebenezer Capen was awakened by a shake to find
John Ellery standing over him

Capen whispered the minister Capen get up I must talk with you

Ebenezer was indignant

Judas priest he exclaimed why dont you scare a feller to death
comin and yankin him out of bed by the back hair Then being more
wide awake he added Whats the row Worse is he He aint

No But Ive got to talk with you You used to be a whaler I know
Were you acquainted in New Bedford

Sartin Was a time when I could have located every stick in it pretty
nigh by the smell if youd set me down side of em blindfold

Did you ever know anyone named He finished the sentence

Sure and sartin I did Why

Did you know him well

Wells I wanted to Pretty decent feller one time but a fast goer and
went downhill like a young ones sled when he got started His folks
had money that was the trouble with him Why course I knew him He
married

I know Now listen

Ellery went on talking rapidly and with great earnestness Ebenezer
listened at first silently then breaking in with ejaculations and
grunts of astonishment He sat up on the edge of the bed

Rubbish he cried at last why taint possible The fellers dead
as Methusalems grandmarm I remember how it happened and

It wasnt true That much I know I KNOW I tell you

He went on to explain why he knew Capens astonishment grew

Judas priest he exclaimed again That would explain why I thought
Id seenThere heave ahead Ive got to see But its a mistake I
dont believe it

The pair entered the sick room The sailor lay in a stupor His
breathing was rapid but faint Capen bent over him and gently moved the
bandage on his face For a full minute he gazed steadily Then he stood
erect drew a big red hand across his forehead and moved slowly back to
the living room

Well asked Ellery eagerly

Ebenezer sat down in the rocker Judas priest he said for the third
time Dont talk to ME When it comes my time theyll have to prove Im
dead I wont believe it till they do Judas PRIEST

Then you recognize him

The old man nodded solemnly

Yup he said its him Mr Ellery what are you goin to do about
it

I dont know I dont know I must go somewhere by myself and think I
dont know WHAT to do

The minister declined to wait for breakfast He said he was not hungry
Leaving Ebenezer to put on the coffeepot and take up his duties as day
nurse Ellery walked off along the beach The dead line prevented his
going very far but he sat down in the lee of a high dune and thought
until his head ached What should he do What was best for him to do

He heard the rattle of the doctors chaise and the voices of Ebenezer
and Parker in conversation He did not move but remained where he was
thinking thinking By and by he heard Capen calling his name

Mr Ellery shouted Ebenezer Mr Ellery where be you

Here replied the minister

The old man came scrambling over the sand He was panting and much
excited

Mr Ellery he cried Mr Ellery its settled for usone part of
it anyhow Hes slipped his cable

What The minister sprang up

Yup He must have died just a little while after you left and after I
gave him his medicine I thought he looked kind of queer then And when
the doctor came we went in together and he was dead Yes sir dead

Dead

Umhm No doubt of it its for good this time Mr Ellery what shall
we do Shall I tell Dr Parker

Ellery considered for a moment No he said slowly No Capen dont
tell anyone I cant see why they need ever know that he hasnt been
dead for years as they supposed Promise me to keep it a secret Ill
tellhermyself later on Now promise me I trust you

Land sakes yes Ill promise if you want me to Im a widower man so
therell be nobody to coax it out of me I guess youre right callate
you be What folks dont know they cant lie about can they and thats
good for your businessmeanin nothin disreverent Ill promise Mr
Ellery Ill swear to it Now come on back to the shanty The doctor
wants you

The next day the body of Murphy foremast hand on the San Jose was
buried in the corner of the Regular graveyard near those who were
drowned in the wreck of that winter There was no funeral of course
The minister said a prayer at the shanty and that was all Ebenezer
drove the wagon which was used as hearse for the occasion and filled in
the grave himself So great was the fear of the terrible smallpox that
the sexton would not perform even that service for its victim

Capen remained at the shanty another week Then as the minister showed
no symptoms of having contracted the disease and insisted that he needed
no companion Ebenezer departed to take up his fishing once more The
old man was provided with a new suit of clothes those he had worn being
burned and having been to his huge disgust fumigated until as he
said he couldnt smell himself without thinking of a match box went
away The room which the dead sailor had occupied was emptied and sealed
tight The San Jose was to stay at her anchorage a while longer Then
when all danger was past she was to be towed to Boston and sold at
auction for the benefit of the heirs of her dead skipper and owner

Ellery himself was most urgent in the decision that he should not go
back to the parsonage and his church just yet Better to wait until he
was sure he said and Dr Parker agreed Id be willing to bet that
you are all right declared the latter but I know Trumet and if I
SHOULD let you go and you did develop even the tail end of a case of
varioloidwell twould be the everlasting climax for you and me in
this county

Staying alone was not unpleasant in a way The dead line still
remained of course and callers did not attempt to pass it but they
came more frequently and held lengthy conversations at a respectful
distance Ellery did his own cooking what little there was to do but
so many good things were pushed under the ropes that he was in a fair
way to develop weight and indigestion Captain Zeb Mayo drove down at
least twice a week and usually brought Mrs Coffin with him From them
and from the doctor the prisoner learned the village news Once Captain
Elkanah and Annabel came and the young ladys gushing praise of the
ministers heroism made its recipient almost sorry he had ever heard
of the San Jose

Dr Parker told him of Grace Van Hornes return to the village She had
come back so the doctor said the day before and was to live at the
tavern for a while at least Yes he guessed even she had given up hope
of Captain Nat now

And say went on Parker how are you feeling

Pretty well thank you replied the minister I seem to be rather
tired and good for nothing More so than I was during the worst of it

No wonder A chap cant go through what you did and not feel some
reaction I expected that Dont get cold thats all But what I want
to know is whether you think I could leave you for a couple of days
The Ostable County Medical Society meets at Hyannis tomorrow and I had
promised myself to take it in this year But I dont want to leave you
if you need me

Ellery insisted that he did not need anyone was getting along finely
and would not hear of his friends missing the medical societys
meeting So the physician went

Goodby he called as he drove off I guess your term is pretty
nearly over I shall let you out of jail inside of four or five days if
you behave yourself

This should have been cheering news but somehow John Ellery did not
feel cheerful that afternoon The tired feeling he had spoken of so
lightly was worse than he had described it and he was despondent for
no particular reason That night he slept miserably and awoke with a
chill to find a cold pouring rain beating against the windows of the
shanty

He could not eat and he could not keep warm even with the cookstove
top red hot and a blanket over his shoulders By noon the chill had
gone and he was blazing with fever Still the rain and the wind and no
visitors at the ropes not even the lightkeeper

He lay down on his bed and tried to sleep but though he dozed a bit
woke always with a start and either a chill or fever fit His head began
to ache violently And then in the lonesomeness and misery fear began
to take hold of him

He remembered the symptoms the doctor had warned him against headache
fever and all the rest He felt his wrists and arms and began to
imagine that beneath the skin were the little bunches like small shot
that were the certain indications Then he remembered how that other man
had looked how he had died Was he to look that way and die like that
And he was all alone they had left him alone

Night came The rain had ceased and stars were shining clear Inside the
shanty the minister tossed on the bed or staggered back and forth about
the two rooms He wondered what the time might be then he did not care
He was alone The smallpox had him in its grip He was alone and he
was going to die Why didnt some one come Where was Mrs Coffin And
Grace She was somewhere near himParker had said soand he must see
her before he died He called her name over and over again

The wind felt cold on his forehead He stumbled amidst the beach grass
What was this thing across his path A rope apparently but why should
there be ropes in that house There had never been any before He
climbed over it and it was a climb of hundreds of feet and the height
made him giddy That was a house another house not the one he had been
living in And there were lights all about Perhaps one of them was the
light at the parsonage And a big bell was booming That was his church
bell and he would be late for the meeting

Some one was speaking to him He knew the voice He had known it always
and would know it forever It was the voice he wanted to hear Grace
he called Grace I want you Dont go Dont go Grace oh my dear
dont go

Then the voice had gone No it had not gone It was still there and he
heard it speaking to him begging him to listen pleading with him to
go somewhere go back back to something or other And there was an arm
about his waist and some one was leading him helping him He broke down
and cried childishly and some one cried with him


Early the next morning just as day was breaking a buggy the horse
which drew it galloping rocked and bumped down the lighthouse lane
Dr Parker his brows drawn together and his lips set with anxiety was
driving He had been roused from sleep in the hotel at Hyannis by a boy
with a telegram Come quick it read Mr Ellery sick The sender
was Noah Ellis the lightkeeper The doctor had hired a fast horse
ridden at top speed to Bayport gotten a fresh horse there and hurried
on He stopped at his own house but a moment merely to rouse his wife
and ask her if there was any fresh news But she had not even heard of
the ministers seizure

My soul Will she cried you dont think its the smallpox do you

Lord knows Im afraid so groaned her husband WHAT made me leave
him I ought to have known better If that boy dies Ill never draw
another easy breath

He rushed out sprang into the buggy and drove on At the ropes early
as it was he found a small group waiting and gazing at the shanty
The lightkeeper was there and two or three other men They were talking
earnestly

How is he Noah demanded the doctor jumping to the ground

I dont know doc replied Ellis I aint heard sence last night when
I telegraphed you

Havent heard What do you mean by that Havent you been with him

Noo was the rather sheepish reply You see II wanted to but my
wifes awful scart Ill catch it and

The devil Dr Parker swore impatiently Who is with him then You
havent left him alone have you

Noo Noah hesitated once more Noo he aint alone Shes there

She Who Keziah Coffin

I dont callate Keziahs heard it yet We was waitin for you fore we
said much to anybody But shes therethethe one that found him You
see he was out of his head and wanderin up the lane most to the main
road and shed been callin on Keziah and when she come away from the
parsonage she heard him hollerin and goin on and

Who did

Whythe lightkeeper glanced at his companionswhy doc twas Grace
Van Horne And she fetched him back to the shanty and then come and got
me to telegraph you

Grace Van Horne Grace VanDo you mean to say she is there with him
NOW

Yes She wouldnt leave him She seemed most as crazys he was My
wife and me we

But Parker did not wait to hear the rest He ran at full speed to the
door of the shanty Grace herself opened it

How is he demanded the doctor

I think he seems a little easier at any rate hes not delirious Hes
in there Oh Im so thankful youve come

Is that the doctor called Ellery weakly from the next room Is it

Yes replied Parker throwing off his coat and hat Coming Mr
Ellery

For Gods sake doctor send her away Dont let her stay Make her go
Make her GO Ive got the smallpox and if she stays she will die Dont
you understand she MUST go

Hush John said Grace soothingly Hush dear

Dr Parker stopped short and looked at her She returned the look but
without the slightest semblance of selfconsciousness or embarrassment
She did not realize that she had said anything unusual which must
sound inexplicably strange to him Her thoughts were centered in that
adjoining room and she wondered why he delayed

Well she asked impatiently What is it Why do you wait

The doctor did not answer However he waited no longer but hurried in
to his new patient


CHAPTER XVIII

IN WHICH KEZIAH DECIDES TO FIGHT


The news was flying from house to house along the main road Breakfasts
were interrupted as some neighbor rushed in to tell the story which
another neighbor had brought to him or her Mr Ellery was very sick
and it was feared he had the smallpox that was what Mrs Parker the
doctors wife told those who lived near her By the time the Corners
heard of it the tale had grown until the minister was said to be dying
And when it reached Gaius Winslows home at the upper end of the town he
was reported dead This was denied upon investigation but soon another
rumor grew and spread Grace Van Horne was with him had taken him back
to the shanty and insisted upon staying there until the doctor came
Facing that dreadful disease andIt was wonderfuland queer

At the Danielses house the servant girl rushed into the dining room to
serve the toast and the story at one swoop Captain Elkanahs dignity
deserted him for an instant and his egg spoon jingled to the floor
Annabels face turned a dull red Her eyes flashed sparks

Pa she cried IIif you dont do something now Ill never

Her father shook his head warningly Debby he said to the maid you
neednt wait

Debby departed reluctantly After the kitchen door had closed Captain
Elkanah said My dear we mustnt be too hasty in this matter
Remember Mr Ellery is very sick As forfor the Van Horne girl we
havent heard the whole truth yet She may not be there at all or it
may be just an accident

Accident Pa you make me boil Accident Accidents like that dont
happen If you let her stay there or ifOh to think of it And we
were calling him a hero andand everything Hero he stayed there just
so she might

Hush hush child

I shant hush Pa are you going to let him disgrace himself with HER

No no Probably there aint any idea of his marrying her If there
is

If there is you put him out of the church and out of this town And
as for HEROoh And weve been having him here at dinner andand I
haveOh I shall die I wish I WAS dead

Then followed hysterics and agony greedily listened to by Debby whose
ear was at the crack of the door Captain Elkanah soothed and pleaded
and tried to pacify It ended by his promising to investigate and if
necessary take steps immejitly

Lavinia Pepper sprung the mine on her brother Kyan was horrified He
had grown to be one of Ellerys most devoted worshipers

Smallpox he groaned The minister got the smallpox Oh thats
turrible

Aint it observed his sister also horrified but rather relishing
the horror And if it hadnt been for Gracie Van Horne

WHAT

Whats the matter with you I say if Gracie Van Horne hadnt happened
to meet him wanderin around crazy as a coot and toted him back

GracieVanHorne Godfreys mighty Sheshe met him Where Down to
Peterss grove was it

Peterss grove No What on earth made you think twas there Shed
been visitin Keziah Coffin at the parsonage and when she come out
on the main road she heard him aravin down the lane Must have passed
right by this house and we never heard him I never see such a dead man
as you be when youre asleep You dont SOUND dead Ill say that for
you but nothin wakes you up

Why Laviny you never woke up yourself

Thats right lay it onto me I expected you would its just like
you But why in time did you think Grace met the minister way down to
Peterss grove Thats the most loony notion ever I heard even from
you What made you think of it

Nothin nothin I guess I WAS loony maybe Dear dear dear have
you heard hows hes gettin on Is he took bad

I aint heard nothin yet nobody has But see here Bish Pepper you
act funny to me I want to know more about that Peterss grove notion
WHY did you say it

Kyan wriggled upon the rack and dodged and squirmed for the next twenty
minutes He tried his best to keep the fateful secret but he admitted
too much or not enough and his sister kept up the crossexamination
At the end of the session she was still unsatisfied but she was on
the scent and her brother knew it He fled to the woodshed and there
punctuated his morning task of kindling chopping with groans and awful
forebodings

One of the very first to hear of the ministers illness was Keziah
Coffin Mrs Parker told her and Keziah started for the beach before the
tale of Graces part in the nights happenings reached the village She
did not wait for a conveyance hardly waited to throw a shawl over her
shoulders but began to cover the three miles on foot She had walked
nearly two thirds of the distance when Captain Zeb Mayo overtook her and
gave her a seat in his chaise

They said little during the drive the shock and anxiety forbidding
conversation At the ropes was the same group larger now and Dr
Parkers horse was hitched to one of the posts

You cant go in Mrs Coffin said Thoph Black The doctor give us
his orders not to let nobody get by I guess nobody wants to but all
the same

Keziah paid not the slightest attention to Mr Black She stooped
beneath his arm under the rope and was on her way to the shanty before
they realized her intention Captain Zeb roared a command for her to
return but she kept on No one followed not even the captain Mrs
Mayo had strictly forbidden his passing the dead line

Keziah opened the door and entered the little building The living room
was empty but at the sound of her step some one came from the room
adjoining That some one was Grace

Aunt Keziah she cried What did you come here for Why did you

Gracie exclaimed the housekeeper YouYOU

Dr Parker appeared holding up a hand for silence

Hush he cried Hes quiet now and I think he will sleep Dont talk
here Go outside if you must talkand I suppose you must

Grace led the way Fortunately the door was on the side not visible
from the spot where Captain Zeb and the rest were standing Keziah
bewildered and amazed at the girls presence followed dumbly

Now auntie whispered Grace turning to her you want to know how
he is of course Well I think he is better The doctor thinks so too
But why did you come here

Why did I come I Why because my place was here I belonged here
For the love of mercys sakes what are YOU doin here With HIM And the
smallpox

Hush I cant help it I dont care I dont care for anything any
more Im glad I came Im glad I was the one to find him and help him
No matter what happensto meIm glad I never was so glad before I
love him Aunt Keziah I can say it to you for you know ityou must
know it I LOVE him and he needed me and I came He was calling my name
when I found him He might have died there alone in the wet and cold
and I saved him Think what that means to me

The girl was in a sort of frenzy of excitement and hysterical
exaltation All the night she had been calm and quiet repressing her
feelings and tending the man she loved Now with some one to whom she
could confide she was calm no longer Keziah answered her soothingly
questioning her from time to time until at last she learned the whole
story

The door opened softly and Dr Parker came out

Hes asleep he said And hes better much better And Ill tell you
something else if you wont make too much noise about ithe hasnt got
the smallpox

The two women looked at him

Fact he said with an emphatic nod Not a symptom of it Id have
bet my best hat that he wasnt going to have it and I wont have to go
bareheaded yet awhile He is pretty close to brain fever though but I
guess hell dodge that this time with care On the whole Keziah Im
glad you came This young lady with a movement of the head toward
Grace has done her part She really saved his life if Im not
mistaken Now I think she can go away and leave him to you and me Ill
pretty nearly guarantee to have him up and out of thisthis pesthole in
a fortnight

Here was joyful tidings the better for being so unexpected Keziah
leaned against the boards and drew a long breath Grace said nothing
but after a moment she went into the house

Thats a good thing too commented Parker watching her as she went
I wanted to talk with you Keziah Coffin and right away Now then
theres something up something that I dont know about and I rather
guess you do Young womeneven when theyre her kind and thats as good
a kind as there isdont risk smallpox for any young man they pick up
casually They dont carryI guess it was pretty nearly carryinghim
home and put him to bed and care for him and cry over him and call him
dear And he doesnt beg them to run away and let him die rather than
to stay there and risk dying too No not to any great extent Now
Keziah you and I are fairly good friends and we ought to know each
other by this time I see a lighta little one Now then if you turn
up the lamp so that I can see the whole blaze maybe I can help those
two in yonder

Keziah considered All right doctor she said when she reached a
decision all right Ill tell you the whole thing and you can see one
of the reasons why my hair is gettin grayer This thing has reached the
point now where theres no keepin it quiet Folkll knowI spose they
know alreadythat shes been here with him Theyll suspect a lot more
and the truth is better than suspicionthat is it cant be worse than
the suspicions that come natural to a good many minds in this town I
am glad I can tell you for I guess the times come to step out in
broad daylight and hist our colors Now you listen Here tis from
beginnin to end

She went on to tell all she knew of her parsons love story

Dr Parker listened

Hum he said thoughtfully I see What made her change her mind so
suddenly You say or you gather from what Mr Ellery told you that she
had all but agreed to marry him She cares for him thats sure Then
all at once she throws him over and accepts Nat Of course her uncles
sudden seizure was a shock and he wanted Nat to have her but she isnt
the kind of girl to be easily swayed Why did she do it

Well doctor thats kind of a puzzle to me All I can think is that
she come to realize what it might mean to him the minister if he
married a ComeOuter I think she done it for his sake to save him
though what made her realize it all at once I dont know Theres the
part we aint heard

I guess youre right Something happened between the time she left
Ellery and when you and I reached the tavern But never mind that that
doesnt count now Lets look at things as they are this minute Shes
here and folks know it As they do know it theyll begin to talk and
the more they talk the farther from the truth theyll getmost of em
Nat poor chap is dead so her promise to him is canceled Ellery will
get well if he isnt troubled and her being with him will help more
than anything else I can understand now why he broke down

Yes he aint been himself since it happened

Of course and the last few weeks of worry and night work have helped
to wreck his nerves Well as I see it theres only one thing to do If
she leaves him hell go to pieces again so she mustnt leave And she
cant stay without an explanation I say lets give the explanation
lets come right out with the announcement that theyre engaged

Whew thatll stir things up

You bet But let it stir I like that parson of yours hes a trump
And I always liked her although generally speaking I dont love
ComeOuters And I like her more than ever now when she risked what she
thought was smallpox to care for him As I said she saved his life and
she ought to have him She SHALL have him

But shes a ComeOuter andtheres the church

Well I know it But he never was so popular as he is now And she
isnt by any means a steadygoing ComeOuter Why Zeke Bassett and
the rest have been finding fault with her and calling her a backslider
Thatll help Then you trust me to whoop up her heroism and the fact
that without her he would have died We can do it Keziah Come on Ive
tackled a good many jobs but matchmaking isnt one of em Here goes to
tackle that

Keziah was delighted here was work after her own heart But she still
hesitated

Doctor she said youve forgot one thing thats Gracie herself
Would she marry him now knowing it may mean the loss of his ministry
and all any more than she would at first I dont believe it

Thats your part Keziah Youve got to show her she MUST marry him or
hell die see Call on me to back you up in any fairy yarn you spin
You prove to her its her duty to marry him Youll have to stay here
and help nurse of course and thats easy because his disease isnt
contagious You convince her and Ill take care of the congregation
Hell live to be minister here for the rest of his life if he wants to
and shell be a ministers wife and sit in the front pew Ill guarantee
the church if youll guarantee the girl Why its your duty Come now
what do you say

Keziahs hesitation was at an end Her face lit up

I say good she cried And Ill be thankful to you all the rest of
my life But for the dear mercy sakes dont say duty to me again Oh
doctor if you only knew what it means to me to be fightin at last for
somethin that aint just duty but what I really want I do honestly
believe we can win Glory hallelujah And now I want to give you a
piece of advice your course for the first leg as you might say you
see Capn Zebedee Mayo

Humph Capn Zeb is the first man I mean to see

Captain Zeb listened with his mouth and eyes and ears open Mrs Mayo
was with him when the doctor called and she too listened

Well exclaimed the captain when the plea for support was ended
Well by the flukes of Jonahs whale Talk about surprises Old lady
what do you say

I say go ahead Zebedee Go ahead If Mr Ellery wanted to marry
Jezebels sister and I knew he really wanted to IdI do believe Id
help him get her And Grace Van Horne is a good girl Go ahead

Of course put in Parker profiting by a hint of Mrs Coffins
of course Daniels will fight tooth and nail against us Hell be for
discharging Ellery at once And he really runs the parish committee

He does hey Well I callate he dont Not if Im on deck he dont
All right doctor Im with you He he he he chuckled Say doc do
you know I sort of love a good lively row Thats been the only trouble
with our society sence Mr Ellery took command of itthere aint been
any rows He he he Well therell be one now

There was and it was lively enough to suit even Captain Zeb Dr
Parker on his calls that day was assailed with a multitude of
questions concerning Graces presence at the shanty He answered them
cheerfully dilating upon the girls bravery her good sense and the
fact that she had saved Mr Ellerys life Then he confided as a strict
secret the fact that the two were engaged Before his hearers had
recovered from the shock of this explosion he was justifying the
engagement Why shouldnt they marry if they wanted to It was a free
country The girl wasnt a ComeOuter any longer and besidesand this
carried weight in a good many householdswhat a black eye the marriage
would be for that noaccount crowd at the chapel

Captain Zebedee having shipped with the insurgents worked for them
from sunrise to sunset and after Zeb was something of a politician and
knew whom to get at He sought his fellows on the parish committee and
labored with them Mrs Mayo and the doctors wife championed the cause
at sewing circle They were lively those sewing meetings and the fur
flew Didama Rogers and Lavinia Pepper were everywhere and ready to
agree with whichever side seemed likely to win Lavinia was so deeply
interested that she forgot to catechise Abishai further about his
untimely reference to Peterss grove And Kyan puzzled but thankful
kept silence

It was by no means a onesided struggle Captain Elkanah spurred on by
the furious Annabel marshaled his forces and proclaimed that Ellery
having disgraced the Regular Society should no longer occupy its
pulpit

If he does thundered Elkanah I shall never cross the threshold of
that church And Ive worshiped there for fifty years Humha I should
like to know whose money has gone more liberal for that meeting house
than mine But not another centno sir not oneif that licentious
young scamp continues to blaspheme there

He hinted concerning a goodsized contribution toward a parish house
something the society needed If Ellery was discharged the contribution
would probably be made not otherwise And this was a point worth
considering

Daniels also wrote to his influential friends of the National Regular
Society But Captain Zebedee had forestalled him there and both letters
were laid on the table to await further developments As for the
ComeOuters they were wild with rage and Grace was formally read out of
their communion

I wonder shrieked Ezekiel Bassett in prayer meeting what the
sperrit of the good and great man who used to lead us from this ere
platform would say if he was here now Hey what would he say

Josiah Badger upreared his lanky person I dreamed about Capn
Eben tother nninnunnight he stammered I see him just
asppuppupplain as you hear me nnnow And he says to me he says
Josiah he says IIII

Ki yi broke in Thoph Baker from the shadow of the rear seat Josiah
turned to berate Thoph who being in disgrace because of his defense of
Ellery was reckless and the communication from the dead leader of the
ComeOuters was lost in the squabble which followed

Meantime Keziah installed as head nurse at the shanty was having her
troubles The minister was getting better slowly but surely getting
better The danger of brain fever was at an end but he was very weak
and must not be excited so the doctor said He knew nothing of the
struggle for and against him which was splitting Trumet in twain and
care was taken that he should not know it He was not allowed to talk
and for the most part was quite contented to be silent watching Grace
as she moved about the room If he wondered why she was still with him
he said nothing and the thought of what his congregation might say did
not vex him in the least She was there he saw her every day that was
enough

He had expressed a wish to talk with his housekeeper Ive got
something to tell you Aunt Keziah he said weakly Some news for you
andand

Cats foot snapped Keziah briskly dont start in tellin me news
now Ive got my hands full as tis Newsll keep and you wont if you
talk another minute

But this is important

So are you though you may not think so If you dont believe it ask
Grace

Well the minister sighed Well perhaps I wont tell it now Id
rather wait until I feel stronger You won t care will you It will be
hard to tell and I

No no Care No If its bad news I dont want to hear it and if its
good I can wait I callate You turn over and take a nap

She could manage him it was with Grace that she had her struggle John
was safe now he would be himself again before very long and the girl
had begun to think of his future and his reputation She knew that
gossip must be busy in the village and much as she wished to remain by
his side she decided that she should not do so And then Keziah began
to fulfill her agreement with Dr Parker

First and bluntly she told the girl that her leaving now was useless
The secret was out it had been made public Everyone knew she was
in love with John and he with her Their engagement was considered an
established certainty Grace was greatly agitated and very indignant

Who dared say so she demanded Who dared say we were engaged Its
not true Its a wicked lie andWho is responsible Aunt Keziah

Well I suppose likely I am much as anybody deary

You You Aunt Keziah

Yup me You are in love with him at any rate you said so And youre
here with him aint you If you two aint engaged you ought to be

Aunt Keziah how can you speak so Dont you realize

Look here Dont you want to marry him

WANT to Oh pleaseHow can you I

Sssh There there I am a bullheaded old thing for sure But Im
like the dog that chased the rat across the shelf where they kept the
best china my intentions are good Dont cry deary Lets get to the
bottom of this thing as the man said when he tumbled into the well
When I first knew that you and John were in love with each other I felt
dreadful I knew your uncle and I knew Trumet If you had married then
or let people know that you thought of it twould have been the end
and ruin for John and you But things are diffrent now a good deal
diffrent John is worshiped pretty nigh since his pluck with that
smallpox man He could go into church and dance a jig in the pulpit and
nobodyor precious few at leastwould find fault And youve stood
by him If it want for you he wouldnt be here today and people know
that Dr Parker and Captain Zebedee and Gaius Winslow and dozens more
are fighting for him and for you And the doctor says they are going to
win Do you want to spoil it all

Aunt Keziah that night before uncle died I was upstairs in my room and
I heard uncle and Captain Elkanah Daniels talking

Elkanah Was he there at your house

Yes Somehow or otherI dont know howhe had learned aboutabout
John and me And he was furious Aunt Keziah I heard him say that
unless I broke off with John he would drive him from the ministry and
from Trumet and disgrace him forever He said that if I really cared for
him I would not ruin his life That brought me to myself I realized how
wicked I had been and what I was doing That was why II

There there Tut tut tut hum Now I see But Gracie you aint
goin to ruin his life No nor Elkanah aint goin to do it either
He cant no matter how hard he tries Ive lived to see the day when
theres a bigger man in the Reglar church than Elkanah Daniels and I
thank the good Lord for it

I never should have come here I know it But he needed me Aunt
Keziah he was sick and dying almost and I couldnt leave him I came
and now he will be ruined and disgraced

He wont I tell you he wont Listen to me I aint talkin for my
health Listen

She argued and pleaded and coaxed and at last when she began to think
she had prevailed Grace brought forward another objection She had
given her word to her uncle How could she break that promise made to a
dying man She would feel like a traitor

Traitor to who demanded the housekeeper losing patience Not
to poor Nat for hes gone And dont you suppose that he and Eben
understand things better now where they are Do you suppose that Nat
wouldnt want you to be happy I know he would for I knew him

It was still unsettled when the long talk was over but Grace agreed not
to leave the minister at present She would stay where she was until he
was himself again at least Keziah was satisfied with the preliminary
skirmish She felt confident of winning the victory and in the prospect
of happiness for others she was almost happy herself Yet each time the
mail was brought to the shanty she dreaded to look at it and the sight
of a stranger made her shake with fear Ansel Coffin had threatened to
come to Trumet If he came she had made up her mind what to do

The parish committee was to meet Captain Elkanah had announced his
intention of moving that John Ellery be expelled from the Regular
church There was to be no compromise no asking for a resignation he
must be discharged thrown out in disgrace The county papers were full
of the squabble but they merely reported the news and did not take
sides The fight was too even for that

Captain Zeb chuckled Its all right Keziah he said We know whats
what and whos who The Rev Mr Ellery can preach here for the next
hundred year if he lives that long and wants to and he can marry
whoever he darn pleases besides Elkanahs licked and he knows it He
aint got enough backers to man a lobster dory Let him holler noise
dont scare grown folks

One afternoon a few days before the date set for the meeting Elkanah
and two or three of his henchmen were on the piazza of the Daniels home
discussing the situation They were blue and downcast Annabel was in
the sitting room shedding tears of humiliation and jealous rage on the
haircloth sofa

Well observed her father theres one thing we can do If the
vote in committee goes against us I shall insist on the calling of a
congregational meeting Humha Yes I shall insist on that

Wont be no good capn sniffed Beriah Salters dolefully The
biggest part of the congregations for Ellery and you know it Theyre
as sot on him as if he was the angel Gabriel If youd only told what
you knew afore this smallpox business wed have been able to give him
and his ComeOuter woman what blongs to em But not now

Captain Daniels shifted uneasily in his chair

Humha he barked to cover confusion Humha It seemed to me
moreercharitable to give the misguided young man another chance and
I did it ButWhats that

Some one was talking excitedly on the sidewalk beyond the lilac bushes
at the border of the Daniels property Voices answered Didama Rogers
darted out of her yard and past the house in the direction of the
sounds Salters rose and walked down to the gate

Hey he shouted Halloo Ahoy there You Emlous what is it

Emulous Sparrow the fish peddler was seated in his cart which was
surrounded by men and women neighbors of the Danielses There was a
perfect storm of questionings and ejaculations Salters opened the gate
and joined the group A moment later he came running back up the walk
toward the piazza

Capn he shouted Capn Elkanah heres news What do you think A
telegrams just come from Nat Hammond Hes safe and sound in New York
and hell be here day after tomorrow

They could not believe it and rushed out to hear more Emulous glowing
with importance affirmed that it was so He had seen the telegram at
the store It was for Grace Van Horne and they were just going to send a
boy over to the shanty with it

No details nor nothin he declared Just said Am all right
Arrived today Will be in Trumet Thursday And twas signed Nathaniel
Hammond There

Well by thunder exclaimed Salters If that dont beat all I
wonder whats happened to him Two year gone and give up for dead and
nowWhat do you callate it means

Captain Elkanah seized him by the arm and led him out of the group
The old mans face was alight with savage joy and his voice shook with
exultation

Ill tell you one thing it means he whispered It means the end of
Ellery so far as his marrying her is concerned She gave her word to
Hammond and shell keep it Shes no liar whatever else she is He may
be minister of the Regular church though ILL never set under him but
hell never marry her now


CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH A RECEPTION IS CALLED OFF


Far out on the Pacific coast there are two small islands perhaps
a hundred miles distant from one another The first of these is
uninhabited On the other is a little colony of Englishspeaking people
halfbreed descendants of native women and the survivors of a crew from
a British vessel cast away there in the latter part of the eighteenth
century

On the first of these islands the smaller one the Sea Mist had been
wrecked Driven out of her course by a typhoon she staggered through
day after day and night after night of terrific wind and storm until
at last there was promise of fair weather Captain Nat nearly worn out
from anxiety care and the loss of sleep had gone to his stateroom
and the first mate was in charge It was three oclock the wind still
blowing and the darkness pitchy when the forward lookout shrieked a
warning Breakers under the lee Almost the next instant the ship was
on a coral reef full of water and the seas breaking over her from stem
to stern

Morning came and showed a little patch of land with palm trees and
tropical vegetation waving in the gusts and green in the sunshine
Captain Nat ordered the boats to be lowered Much as he hated the
thought he saw that the Sea Mist had made her last voyage and must
be abandoned He went to the cabin collected papers and charts and
prepared to leave The ships money over ten thousand dollars in gold
belonging to the owner and to be used in trade and speculation among the
East Indies he took with him Then the difficult and dangerous passage
through the opening in the reef was begun

Only the captains boat reached the shore The mates was caught by a
huge breaker dashed against the reef and sunk Captain Nat his second
mate and five of his men were all that was left of the Sea Mists
company And on that island they remained for nearly two weeks
Provisions they had brought ashore with them Water they found by
digging Nat hid the gold at night burying it on the beach below
highwater mark

Then having made sure of his location by consulting the chart he
determined to attempt a voyage to the second island where he knew
the English colony to be Provisions were getting short and to remain
longer where they were was to risk starvation and all its horrors So
in the longboat which was provided with a sail they started Charts
and papers and the gold the skipper took with them None of the crew
knew of the existence of the money it was a secret which the captain
kept to himself

A hundred miles they sailed in the longboat and at last the second
island was sighted They landed and found to their consternation and
surprise that it too was uninhabited The former residents had grown
tired of their isolation and a trading vessel having touched there had
seized the opportunity to depart for Tahiti Their houses were empty
their cattle sheep goats and fowl roamed wild in the woods and the
fruit was rotting on the trees In its way the little island was
an Eyeless Eden flowing with milk and honey but to Captain Nat a
conscientious skipper with responsibilities to his owners it was a
prison from which he determined to escape Then as if to make escape
impossible a sudden gale came up and the longboat was smashed by the
surf

I guess that settles it ruefully observed the second mate another
Cape Codder from Hyannis Callate well stay here for a spell now
hey Capn

For a spell yes replied Nat Well stay here until we get another
craft to set sail in and no longer

Another craft ANOTHER one Where in time you goin to get her

Build her said Captain Nat cheerfully Then pointing to the row of
empty houses and the little deserted church he added Theres timber
and nailsyes and cloth such as tis If I cant build a boat out of
them Ill agree to eat the whole settlement

He did not have to eat it for the boat was built It took them six
months to build her and she was a curiouslooking vessel when done
but as the skipper said She may not be a clipper but shell sail
anywhere if you give her time enough He had been the guiding
spirit of the whole enterprise planning it laying the keel burning
buildings to obtain nails and iron hewing trees for the largest beams
showing them how to spin ropes from cocoanut fiber improvising sails
from the longboats canvas pieced out with blankets and odd bits of
cloth from the abandoned houses Even a strip of carpet from the church
floor went into the making of those sails

At last she was done but Nat was not satisfied

I never commanded a ship where I couldnt hist Yankee colors he
said and by the everlastin I wont now Weve got to have a flag

So from an old pair of blue overalls a white cotton shirt and the
red hangings of the church pulpit he made a flag and hoisted it to the
truck of his queer command They provisioned her gave her a liberal
supply of fresh water and one morning she passed through the opening
of the lagoon out to the deep blue of the Pacific And hidden in her
captains stateroom under the head of his bunk was the ten thousand
dollars in gold For Nat had sworn to himself by the everlasting
and other oaths to deliver that money to his New York owners safe and
necessary expenses deducted of course untouched

For seven weeks the crazy nondescript slopped across the ocean Fair
winds helped her and at last she entered the harbor of Nukahiva over
twelve hundred miles away And thereHammonds luck the sailors
called itwas a United States manofwar lying at anchor the first
American vessel to touch at that little French settlement for five
years The boat they built was abandoned and the survivors of the Sea
Mist were taken on board the manofwar and carried to Tahiti

From Tahiti Captain Nat took passage on a French bark for Honolulu
Here after a months wait he found opportunity to leave for New York
on an American ship the Stars and Stripes And finally after being
away from home for two years he walked into the office of his New York
owners deposited their gold on a table and cheerfully observed Well
here I am

That was the yarn which Trumet was to hear later on It filled columns
of the city papers at the time and those interested may read it in all
its details in a book written by an eminent author The tale of a Cape
Cod sea captain plucky and resourceful and adequate as Yankee sea
captains were expected to be and were in those days

But Trumet did not hear the yarn immediately All that it heard and all
that it knew was contained in Captain Nats brief telegram Arrived
today Will be home Thursday That was all but it was enough for
in that dispatch was explosive sufficient to blow to atoms the doctors
plans and Keziahs the great scheme which was to bring happiness to
John Ellery and Grace Van Horne

Dr Parker heard it while on his way to Mrs Princes and neglecting
that old lady for the once he turned his horse and drove as fast as
possible to the shanty on the beach Fast as he drove Captain Zebedee
Mayo got there ahead of him Captain Zeb was hitching his white and
ancient steed to the post as the doctor hove in sight

By mighty the captain exclaimed with a sigh of relief Im glad
enough youve come doctor I hated to go in there alone Youve heard
of course

Yes Ive heard

Say aint it wonderful Im tickled all up one side and sorry all down
tother Nats a trueblue feller and Im glad enough that he aint
shark bait but what about the minister and her Shes promised to Nat
you know and

I know Dont I know Ive been going over the affair and trying to see
a way out ever since I heard of the telegram Tut tut Im like you
mighty glad Hammond is safe but it would have spared complications if
he had stayed wherever hes been for a few months longer We would have
married those two in there by that time

Sartin we would But he didnt stay Are you goin to tell Mr Ellery

Certainly not And I hope he hasnt been told Hes getting well fast
now but he mustnt be worried or back hell go again We must see Mrs
Coffin Keziah is our main hold That woman has got more sense than all
the rest of us put together

But it was Grace not Keziah who opened the shanty door in answer to
their knock She was pale and greeted them calmly but it was evident
that her calmness was the result of sheer will power

Wont you come in doctor she asked Good afternoon Captain Mayo

Dr Parker entered the building but Captain Zeb remained outside
stammering that he callated hed better stay where he could keep an eye
on his horse This was such a transparent excuse that it would have been
funny at any other time No one smiled now however

Isis Mrs CoffinerKeziah aboard the captain asked

No she isnt She went to the parsonage a few hours ago Mr Ellis
brought the mail and there was a letter in it for her She said it was
important and that she must go home to see about some things Shell be
back pretty soon I suppose

The doctor whispered her name then and she went inside closing the door
after her Captain Zebedee sat down on the step to ponder over the new
and apparently insurmountable difficulty which had arisen As he said
afterwards The more I tried to get an observation the thicker it got
Blamed if I could see anything but fog but I could hearI could hear
Elkanah and his gang gigglin ahead astern and off both bows

Parker found his patient sleeping soundly and had not disturbed him
Returning to the living room he spoke to Grace

Humph he grunted watching her from under his brows everything
seems to be all right in there He hasnt been excited or anything like
that

No

Thats good He mustnt be You understand that He mustnt be told
anything that will upset him Hes getting well fast and I want it to
continue

Yes I understand

Hum Erhave you heardHas anyone been here

Yes I have heard The telegram came and I answered it

You did Well its a miracle and were all thankful of course Did
youerer

Doctor I must go home I mustnt stay here any longer

Why not

You know why not I must be at home when he comes You must get some
one to take my place Aunt Keziah will stay of course and perhaps Mrs
Higgins would come or Hannah Poundberry She

Not if I know it Id as soon have a haycutter running in here as
Hannahs tongue I could stop a haycutter when it got too noisy Well
if you must go you must I suppose But stay through tomorrow at
any rate Nat wont get here until Thursday and I may be able to find
another nurse by that time And what I shall say to him motioning
toward the other room I dont know

Must you say anything Just say that I have been called away for a few
days onon some business Dont tell him Dont tell him the truth
doctor now He is too weak and I am afraid

She stopped and turned away The doctor watched her pityingly

Cheer up he said At any rate this is only for a little while When
the captain knows if hes the man I take him for hell

She whirled like a flash Youre not going to tell him she cried
No no You mustnt You must promise me you wont Promise

Somebodyll tell him Telling things is Trumets specialty

Then you must stop it No one must tell himno one except me I shall
tell him of course He must hear it from me and not from anyone else
He would think I was disloyal and ungratefuland I am I have been But
I wasI COULDNT help it You know doctor you know

Yes yes I know Well Ill promise but it will all come out right
you see You mustnt think Iwehave been interfering in your affairs
Grace But weve all come to think a whole lot of that parson of ours
and what he wanted we wanted him to have thats all

I know Thank you very much for all your kindness and for your
promise

He would have liked to say much more but he could not under the
circumstances He stammered a goodby and with a question concerning
Mrs Coffins whereabouts went out to join Captain Zeb

Well queried the latter anxiously How is it Whats up Whats the
next tack

Well go to the parsonage was the gloomy answer If anybody can see
a glimmer in this cussed muddle Keziah Coffin can

Keziah was on her knees in her room beside a trunk the same trunk she
had been packing the day of the ministers arrival in Trumet She was
working frantically sorting garments from a pile rejecting some and
keeping others She heard voices on the walk below and went down to
admit the callers

Whats the matter Keziah asked Dr Parker sharply after a look at
her face You look as if youd been through the war Humph I suppose
youve heard the news

Keziah brushed back the hair from her forehead Yes she answered
slowly Ive heard it

Well its great news and if it wasnt forif things werent as they
are Id be crowing hallelujahs this minute Trumet has got a good man
safe and sound again and the Lord knows it needs all of that kind it
can get

Yes

Yes But theres the other matter Ive been to see Grace She didnt
say so but it was easy enough to see the man she promised to marry and
thought was dead is alive Shes a girl of her wordshe promised him
and she promised her dying uncleand shell marry him And then what
will become of John Ellery Hell go downhill so fast that a ships
anchor wouldnt hold him If he doesnt die Ill have to send him away
somewhere and the Regular church will lose the minister weve fought so
hard for

Yes concurred Zebedee and them blasted Danielsesll run the shebang
and the rest of usll have to sing small I tell you

So weve come to you Keziah went on the doctor Do you see any
salvation

Yes I do

You do Where

In Nat Hammond If he knows Grace doesnt want to marry him do you
suppose hell hold her to her promise

I dont know Im not so sure Men dont give up girls like that so
easy I wouldntby George I wouldnt And she wont tell him the
whole truth Im afraid Shell pretend to be gladhang it she IS
gladto have him home again and

Of course shes glad Aint we all glad and happy and thankful We
ought to be Butshe hesitateddoctor you leave this to me So
far as John and Grace are concerned you neednt worry Ill take it on
myself to see that they have each other as the Almighty meant em to
Leave it to me Just leave it to me I KNOW I can do it

She would not say more nor tell on what grounds she based her optimism
She would go back to the shanty that evening she said and stay until
the following afternoon Grace would undoubtedly go to the old tavern to
prepare for the homecoming Let Mrs Higgins take her place as nurse

I shall have to leave myself she added for a little while so
perhaps youd better try to get somebody else to help the Higgins woman
Dont ask me any questions please dont and be sure not to say a word
to anybodymost of all to Grace Just do as I tell you and leave it to
me And dont come and see me again until afterafter he comes home
Goodby doctor Goodby Capn Zeb

She shook hands with each of them a rather unusual proceeding as they
thought of it afterwards Then they went away and left her

Humph mused Parker as they came out at the gate Humph She seems
sure doesnt she And yet she doesnt act like herself Did you notice
that

Yup I noticed it But I expect Nats droppin out of the clouds shook
her up same as it done the rest of us Well never mind Shes a bully
good capable woman and what she says shell do she genrally does Im
bettin on her By time I feel better

Captain Elkanah Daniels and his friends were feeling better also and
they were busy Trumet had a new hero now On Wednesday the Boston
papers printed excerpts from Captain Hammonds story and these brief
preliminary accounts aroused the admiration of every citizen It was
proposed to give him a reception Elkanah was the moving spirit in the
preparations Captain Nat so they learned by telegraphing would arrive
on the noon train Thursday His was not to be a prosaic progress by
stage all the way from Sandwich A special carriage drawn by the
Daniels span and escorted by other vehicles was to meet the coach at
Bayport and bring him to Trumet in triumphant procession All this was
to be a surprise of course

Wednesday afternoon the Daniels following was cheered by the tidings
that Grace Van Horne had left the beach and was at her old home the
Hammond tavern And Mrs Poundberry reported her busy as a bee gettin
things ready This was encouraging and indicated that the minister
had been thrown over as he deserved to be and that Nat would find his
fiancee waiting and ready to fulfill her contract Reglar whirligig
that girl sniffed Didama Rogers If she cant have one man shell
take the next and then switch back soons the wind changes However
most likely she never was engaged to Mr Ellery anyhow Hes been out
of his head and might have said some fool things that let Dr Parker and
the rest blieve he was in love with her As for pickin of him up and
totin him back to the shanty that night that want nothin but common
humanity She couldnt let him die in the middle of the lighthouse lane
could she

Thursday was a perfect day and the reception committee was on hand and
waiting in front of the Bayport post office The special carriage the
span brushed and curried until their coats glistened in the sunshine
was drawn up beside the platform The horses had little flags fastened
to their bridles and there were other and larger flags on each side
of the dashboard Captain Daniels imposing in his Sunday raiment
highcollared coat stock silk hat and goldheaded cane sat stiffly
erect on the seat in the rear The other carriages were alongside among
them Captain Zebedee Mayos ancient chaise the white horse sound asleep
between the shafts Captain Zeb had not been invited to join the escort
but had joined it without an invitation

I guess likely Id better be on hand the captain confided to Dr
Parker Maybe I can stop Elkanah from talkin too much aboutwell
about what we dont want him to talk about and besides Im just as
anxious to give Nat a welcome home as the next feller Hes a brick and
were all proud of him By mighty Id like to have seen that craft he
built out of cocoanuts and churchesI would so

Kyan Pepper was there also not yet fully recovered from the surprise
which Lavinias gracious permission had given him Abishai had been
leaning disconsolately over his front gate early that morning when Noah
Ellis the lightkeeper jogged down the lane

Mornin Bish hailed Noah pulling up his horse Whats the
matter You look bluern a spiled mackrel Whats the row Breakfast
disagree with you

Naw replied Kyan shortly Where you bound all rigged up in your
shore duds

Bound to Bayport to see Nat Hammond land was the cheerful answer
I aint had a day off I dont know when and I thought Id take one Be
great doins over there they tell me Elkanahs goin to make a speech
and theres eighteen teams of folks goin

I know it I wisht I was goin too but I never have no fun Have
to stay to home and work and slave over them consarned tax papers
Sometimes I wish there want no taxes

Humph Ive wished that myself moren once Why dont you go if you
want to Climb right aboard here with me Plenty of room

Hey You mean that By godfreys mighty Id like to

Sartin I mean it Come ahead

Mr Pepper sadly shook his head I guess likely Id better not he
sighed Laviny might not like to have me leave her

Oh fiddlesticks she wont mind Ill take care of you Its perfectly
safe There aint goin to be no women around Haw haw haw

He was still laughing at his own joke when through the slats of the
closed blinds shading the Pepper house parlor a shrill voice was heard
speaking

Go ahead Bishy dear called Lavinia Go ahead and go A change of
airll do you good

Kyan whirled and clutched at the gate

HEY he shouted in amazement

Are you deef Or is Mr Ellis laughin so hard that you cant hear
What is it thats so funny Mr Ellis

The lightkeeper shut off his laughter by a sudden and rather frightened
gulp

Oh nothin nothin Miss Pepper Nice day aint it

I guess so I aint had time to look at it yet I have to work I cant
let my wife do it for me like some folks and take days off What was
it you was laughin at Mr Ellis

Nothin nothin at all

Hum They used to tell me there was only one kind of person who laughed
at nothin Well Bish Pepper what are you standin there for If
youre goin come right into the house and change your clothes this
minute

Kyan obeyed Shortly he reappeared clothed like a lily of the field
one that had long since gone to seed He clambered up beside Noah and
they drove off

Jerushy exclaimed the lightkeeper This is kind of unexpected aint
it Whats got into her to make her so accommodatin

Godfreys mighty was the dazed reply I dont know This as fast as
you can drive Hurry up afore she changes her mind

So it happened that Mr Pepper was in Bayport with the rest awaiting
the stage which was bringing Trumets latest celebrity from Sandwich

Here she comes shouted Ezra Simmons the postmaster Right on time
too

Sure enough A cloud of dust in the distance rising on the spring
wind and the rattle of rapidly turning wheels The reception committee
prepared for action Captain Elkanah descended from the carriage and
moved in stately dignity to the front of the postoffice platform

Humha he barked turning to his followers Be ready now Give him
a good cheer when I say the word Let it be heartyhearty yes

The stage its four horses at a trot swung up to the platform

Whoa roared the driver

Now ordered Elkanah OnetwoHurrah

Hurrah shouted the committee its uninvited guests and the
accompanying crowd of Bayport men and boys which had gathered to assist
in the welcome Hurrah

Hooray yelled Kyan a little behind as usual

A passenger or two peered from the coach window The stage driver
ironically touched his cap

Thank ye he said Thank ye very much Ive been hopin for this
for a long time though Id about given up expectin it Im very much
obliged Wont somebody please ask me to make a speech

Captain Elkanah frowned his disapproval

We are cheering Capn Nathaniel Hammond of Trumet he explained
haughtily We are here to meet him and escort him home

The driver sighed You dont say he said And I thought my merits
had been recognized at last And twas all for Capn Hammond Dear
dear

He winked at Simmons who wanted to laugh but did not dare

Come come said Captain Elkanah Where is he Wheres Capn
Hammond

Well now Ill tell ye I dont know where he is

You DONT Isnt he with you

No he aint And he didnt come on the train nuther He WAS on it
The conductor told me he see him and set along with him between stations
as fur as Cohasset Narrows But after that he never see hide nor hair of
him Oh thats so Heres the mail bag Ezry

Captain Elkanah looked at the reception committee and it looked at him
Here was a most disconcerting setback for all the plans The committee
after asking more and fruitless questions went into executive session

Captain Zeb stepped beside the stage and put one foot on the wheel

Say Thad he whispered is that all you know Where did he go to

Cant tell you capn The conductor says he see him afore they got to
Cohasset Narrows and not after Naturally we spose he got off there
Pretty good joke on old Daniels I call it Serve him right figgerin
to take a passenger away from me He he

But you do know more now dont you Tell a fellercome I dont like
Elkanah any bettern you do

Well the drivers voice dropped still lower Well he whispered
I did hear this much though dont you tell none of them A chap I know
was on the train and he said he see Capn Nat get off the cars at the
Cohasset Narrows depot and there was a woman with him

A woman A WOMAN What woman

Blessed if I know And he didnt nuther So long Git dap

The reception committee and its escort drove slowly back to Trumet The
Daniels following was disgusted and disappointed Captain Elkanah had
figured upon keeping Hammond under his own wing until he was safely
deposited at the old tavern Grace was there and Elkanah meant that
these two should meet before any inkling of Ellerys story reached Nats
ears Incidentally he could drop a few damaging hints concerning the
ministers character To hurt Ellery all he could and prejudice Hammond
against himthat was the plan and now it was frustrated The captain
had not put in an appearance and no one knew where he was or when he
would come home Obviously there was nothing to do except give up the
reception and await further news from the missing man

Some of those present wished to remain in Bayport until night Another
train was due in Sandwich and possibly Nat might come on that They
could telegraph and find out whether or not he did come and if he did
could send a carriage for him But this suggestion was overruled The
reception was off

The homeward journey had some unpleasant incidents Several ComeOuters
had driven over Nat belonged to them so they felthe was the son of
their dead founder and leaderand they determined the Regulars should
not have him all to themselves They had come to bid him welcome on
behalf of the worshipers at the chapel Now they took advantage of the
general disappointment to make sarcastic and wouldbehumorous remarks
loud enough for the majestic occupant of the decorated carriage to hear

Seems to me said Thoph Black that them flags ought to be haf mast
That crafts in distress

Sshh counciled his companion another ComeOuter Dont be
irreverent Look whos cruisin under em Thats the King of Trumet
Lets you and me go ahead and fire salutes Thoph

Captain Elkanah wrathfully ordered the flags to be removed from the
horses heads and from the dashboard

As Noah Ellis and his passenger turned into the lighthouse lane another
vehicle turned out of it

Who was that queried Kyan Looked like one of the livery stable
horses to me

Twant Twas Thankful Paynes and that was her carriage too Its
gettin so dark I couldnt see who was drivin it but twas a man
anyhow

Kyan seemed to be pondering I wonder he said slowly I wonder if
that cousin of hers from Sandwich is here visitin That Caleb Pratt
seems to me his name is

Dont know Why

Nothin nothin I just wondered that was all That might explain why
she let me

Hey

Nothin Good night Noah Im much obliged to you for takin me over
even if there want no reception

Trumet spent that evening wondering what had become of Nat Hammond
Captain Zeb Mayo wondered most of all Yet his wonderment was
accompanied by vague suspicions of the truth And at eleven oclock
when the village was in bed a horse and buggy moved down the Turnoff
and stopped before the Hammond gate A man alighted from the buggy and
walked briskly up to the side door There he knocked and then whistled
shrilly

A window overhead was opened

Who is it asked a feminine voice

Dont be frightened Gracie replied the man at the door Its
meNat Ive come home again


CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH THE MINISTER RECEIVES A LETTER


John Ellery was uneasy Physically he was very much better so much
better that he was permitted to sit up a while each day But mentally he
was disturbed and excited exactly the condition which the doctor said
he must not be in Keziah and Grace had gone away and left him and he
could not understand why

Mrs Higgins Ikes mother was at the shanty and she did her best to
soothe and quiet him She was a kind soul and capable in her way but
she could not answer his questions satisfactorily

Where are they he demanded Why did they go Has anything happened
When are they coming back

I cant tell you just when Mr Ellery replied Mrs Higgins Grace
had to go home for aa day or so and Keziah had things to attend to at
the parsonage Dont you fret yourself about them

Im not fretting but it does seem strange I could understand why one
should go perhaps but not both Didnt GraMiss Van Horne tell you
why she went

Well now Mr Ellery dont lets worry about Gracie Shes a good
girl with lots of common sense and

I know that But that doesnt answer me Why did she go

Keziah hadnt been to the parsonage sence that day when you was fust
took sick and I expect likely she felt that shed ought to

Please Mrs Higgins tell me the truth Im not asking about Mrs
Coffin Didnt Miss Van Horne tell you her reason for leaving

No she didnt

But you know the reason Youre keeping something from me Did she say
when she would come back

No not exactly but of course

I know youre keeping something from me What has happened

Happened Land sakes does anything ever happen in Trumet

I think a good many things have happened lately And the longer you
keep the truth from me the more I shall suspect

Mr Ellery you set still in that chair or when the doctor comes
hell put you to bed Ive got some cookin to do and I cant set here
gossipin no longer You behave yourself and stop frettin Im skipper
here nowerfor a while anyhowand youve got to take orders from
me There now I callate youre scared aint you

He did not seem greatly frightened nor in awe of his new skipper
Instead he was evidently preparing to ask more questions Mrs Higgins
hurriedly fled to the living room and closed the door behind her

The minister heard her rattling pans and dishes at a great rate The
noise made him nervous and he wished she might be more quiet He moved
to the chair nearest the window and looked out over the dunes and the
wide stretch of tumbling blue sea The surf was rolling up the shore
the mackerel gulls were swooping and dipping along the strand the beach
grass was waving in the wind A solitary fish boat was beating out past
the spar buoy She was almost over the spot when the San Jose had first
anchored

The view was a familiar one He had seen it in all weathers during a
storm at morning when the sun was rising at evening when the moon
came up to tip the watery ridges with frosted silver He had liked
it tolerated it hated it and then after she came loved it He had
thought it the most beautiful scene in all the world and one never to be
forgotten The dingy old building with its bare wooden walls had been
first a horror then a prison and at last a palace of contentment With
the two women one a second mother to him and the other dearest of
all on earth he could have lived there forever But now the old prison
feeling was coming back He was tired of the view and of the mean little
room He felt lonely and deserted and despairing

His nerves were still weak and it was easy in his childish condition
to become despondent He went over the whole situation and felt more and
more sure that his hopes had been false ones and that he had builded a
fools paradise After all he remembered she had given him no promise
she had found him ill and delirious and had brought him there She had
been kind and thoughtful and gracious but that she would be to anyone
it was her nature And he had been content weak as he was to have her
near him where he would see her and hear her speak Her mere presence
was so wonderful that he had been satisfied with that and had not asked
for more And now she had gone Mrs Higgins had said for a day or
two but that was indefinite and she had not said she would return
when those two days had passed He was better now almost well Would
she come back to him After all conditions in the village had not
changed He was still pastor of the Regular church and she was a
ComeOuter The man she had promised to marry was deadyes But the
other conditions were the same And Mrs Higgins had refused to tell
him the whole truth he was certain of that She had run away when he
questioned her

He rose from the chair and started toward the living room He would not
be put off again He would be answered His hand was on the latch of the
door when that door was opened Dr Parker came in

The doctor was smiling broadly His ruddy face was actually beaming He
held out his hand seized the ministers and shook it

Good morning Mr Ellery he said Its a glorious day Yes sir a
bully day Hey isnt it

Ellerys answer was a question

Doctor he said why have Mrs Coffin andand Miss Van Horne gone
Has anything happened I know something has and you must tell me what
Dont try to put me off or give me evasive answers I want to know why
they have gone

Parker looked at him keenly Humph he grunted Ill have to get
into Mrs Higginss wig I told her not to let you worry and you have
worried Youre all of a shake

Never mind that I asked you a question

I know you did Now Mr Ellery Im disappointed in you I thought you
were a sensible man who would take care of his health now that hed got
the most of it back again Ive got news for yougood newsbut Im not
sure that I shall tell it to you

Good news Dr Parker if youve got news for me that is good for
Heavens sake tell it Ive been imagining everything bad that could
possibly happen Tell me quick My health can stand that

Yees yes I guess it can They say joy doesnt kill and thats one
of the few medical proverbs made by unmedical men that are true You
come with me and sit down in that chair Yes you will Sit down

He led his patient back to the chair by the window and forced him into
it

There he said Now Mr Ellery if you think you are a man a
sensible man who wont go to pieces like a tenyearold youngster
IllIll let you sit here for a while

Doctor

You sit still No Im not going to tell you anything You sit where
you are and maybe the newsll come to you If you move it wont Going
to obey orders Good Ill see you by and by Mr Ellery

He walked out of the room It seemed to Ellery that he sat in that chair
for ten thousand years before the door again opened And then

Grace he cried O Grace youyouve come back

She was blushing red her face was radiant with quiet happiness but her
eyes were moist She crossed the room bent over and kissed him on the
forehead

Yes John she said Ive come back Yes dear Ive come back toto
you


Outside the shanty on the side farthest from the light and its group
of buildings the doctor and Captain Nat Hammond were talking with Mrs
Higgins The latter was wildly excited and bubbling with joy

Its splendid she exclaimed Its almost too fine to believe Now
well keep our minister wont we

I dont see why not observed the doctor with quiet satisfaction
Zeb and I had the Daniels crowd licked to a shoestring and now theyll
stay licked The parish committee is three to one for Mr Ellery and the
congregation more than that Keep him You bet well keep him And
Ill dance at his weddingthat is unless hes got religious scruples
against it

Mrs Higgins turned to Captain Nat

Its kind of hard for you Nat she said But its awful noble and
selfsacrificin and everybodyll say so Of course there wouldnt be
much satisfaction in havin a wife you knew cared more for another man
But still its awful noble of you to give her up

The captain looked at the doctor and laughed quietly

Dont let my nobility weigh on your mind Mrs Higgins he said Id
made up my mind to do this very thing afore ever I got back to Trumet
That is if Gracie was willin And when I found she was not only
willin but joyful Iwell I decided to offer up the sacrifice right
off

You did You DID Why how you talk I never heard of such a thing in
my born days

Nor I neither not exactly But there with a wink at Parker you see
Ive been off amongst all them Kanaka women and how do you know but Ive
fell in love

Nat HAMMOND

Oh well IWhat is it Grace

She was standing in the doorway and beckoning to him Her cheeks were
crimson the breeze was tossing her hair about her forehead and she
made a picture that even the practical unromantic doctor appreciated

By George Nat he muttered youve got more courage than I have If
twas my job to give her up to somebody else Id think twice Ill bet

The captain went to meet her

What is it he asked

Nat she whispered will you come in He wants to see you

John Ellery was still seated in the chair by the window but he no
longer looked like an invalid There was no worry or care in his
countenance now merely a wondrous joy and serene happiness

He held out his hands and the captain shook them heartily

Mr Ellery he said as they used to say at the circus Here we are
again And you and I have been doing all kinds of circus acrobatics
since we shook last hey Im glad youre pretty nigh out of the sick
bayand the doctor says you are

Captain began Ellery Hammond interrupted him

Hold on he said Belay right there If you and I are to cruise in
the same familyand thats what I hear is likely to happenI
callate well heave overboard the capns and Misters My names
NathanielNat for short

All right And mine is John CaptainNat I meanhow can I ever
thank you

Thank me What do you want to thank me for I only handed over
somethin that wasnt mine in the first place and belonged to you all
along I didnt know it that was the only trouble

But your promise to your father I feel

You neednt I told dad that it was just as Grace said She says shes
got a better man or words to that effect AndI dont know how you
feel about such things Johnbut I blieve theres a broader outlook up
aloft than there is down here and that dad would want me to do just what
I have done Dont worry about me Im doin the right thing and I
know it And dont pity me neither I made up my mind not to marry
Graceunless of course she was set on itmonths ago Im tickled to
death to know shes goin to have as good a man as you are Shell tell
you so Grace Hello shes gone

Yes I told her I wanted to talk with you alone for a few minutes
Nat Grace tells me that Aunt Keziah was the one who

She was She met me at the Cohasset Narrows depot I was settin in the
car lookin out of the window at the sand and sniffin the Cape air By
the everlastin there aint any air or sand like em anywheres else
I feel as if I never wanted to see a palm tree again as long as I live
Id swap the whole of the South Pacific for one Trumet sandhill with a
huckleberry bush on it Well as I started to say I was settin there
lookin out of the window when somebody tapped me on the shoulder I
looked up and twas her

You could have blown me over with a fan By the jumpin Moses you
could You see Id been thinkin about herthat is I was

He hesitated turned red coughed and went on

I was surprised enough to see her I tell you Way up there at the
Narrows I couldnt have said a word anyway and she never gave me a
chance Nat she says dont talk now Come with me quick afore the
train starts

Still I didnt say anything nothin sane anyhow Keziah I managed
to stutter KEZIAH

Come says she Hurry I want you to get off here Ive come here on
purpose to meet you I must talk with you its important You can go
to Trumet on the next train tonight But now I must talk with you I
MUST Wont you please come Nat

Well I went The engine bell was beginnin to ring and we had to move
lively I tell you I swung her off the step just as the car begun to
move After the smoke had faded away around the next bend I realized
that my hat had faded away along with it Yes sir Id left it on the
seat Ha ha ha

He laughed uproariously Ellery laughed in sympathy

However I want worryin about hats just then All I wanted to do
was stand still like a frozen image and stare at her You see John
I hadnt laid eyes on a friend one of the real homemade kind for more
days than I wanted to count and here was one of em one of the best
passed out to me unexpected and ahead of time like a surprise party
present So I just pumped her hand up and down and stared I didnt have
any exclusive mortgage on the starin by no means for the depot master
and a dozen or so loafers was lookin at us with their mouths wide open

I guess she noticed it for she says Dont stay here Nat Come in
the waitin room or somewheres where we can talk

So into the waitin room we went and come to anchor on the settee Six
or eight of the loafers settled themselves handy to the door sos they
could peek in occasionally I remember I told one of them not to stretch
his neck that way cause he might never get it back into shape again and
in the gunnin season that would be dangerous Some nearsighted feller
might take you for a goose I says Ho ho

And then John we had our talk Seems she left Trumet Wednesday
afternoon Got the livery stable man to drive her as fur as Bayport
hired another team there and come on to Sandwich Stayed overnight there
and took the mornin train which got to Cohasset Narrows just ahead of
the one I was comin on Shed been so afraid of bein late she said
She must see me afore I got to Trumet

Well she saw me and told me the whole yarn about you and Grace She
tried to break it to me gently so I wouldnt feel too bad She knew it
would be a shock to me she said It was a shock in a way but as for
feelin bad I didnt I think the world of Grace Id do anything she
wanted me to do but most the way down on the trainyes and long afore
thatId been dreadin my comin home on one account I dreaded tellin
her that unless she was real set on it shed better not marry me

You see John Ive thought a lot sence Ive been away Had
considerble time to do it in And the more I thought the less that
promise to dad seemed right Id have bet my souwester Gracie never
cared for me in the way a girl ought to care for a chap shes goin to
ship as pilot for the rest of her days And as for mewell II had
my reasons for not wantin to marry her

He paused again sighed started to speak and then sat silent looking
out of the window Ellery laid a hand on his knee

Nat said the minister you saved my life once do you remember that
I do if you dont

Saved your life What are you talkin about Oh that time on the
flats That wasnt savin your life twas savin your clothes from
gettin a wettin

No it was more than that And now I guess youve saved it again you
and Grace between you Yes and Aunt Keziah Bless her to think of her
going way up there to meet you and help us

Yes Twas like her wasnt it She said she knew Id hear the yarn
when I got to Trumet but she wanted me to hear it just as it was and
nobody but she and Grace and you knew the whole truth about it So she
come Im glad she did not that I shouldnt have done the same whoever
told me but

Nat I want to tell you something Something that only one other person
knows Grace doesnt know it yet Neither does Aunt Keziahthe whole of
it And if she knew I told you even a part Im afraid she would as she
would say skin me alive But I owe herand youmore than I could
repay if I lived a thousand years So Im going to tell and take the
consequences

The captain looked at him Well he exclaimed Whats comin now
More secrets Blessed if this aint gettin more excitin than the South
Seas I used to think excitement in Trumet was scurcer than cream in
poorhouse coffee but Ill have to change my mind

Nat whenthat morning after your father died and after you and Grace
had agreed toto

To do somethin neither of us wanted to do Yes I know Go ahead

That morning Aunt Keziah came home to the parsonage and broke the
news to me She did it as only she could do such a thing kindly and
pityingly and

Of course Thats Keziah

Yes Well as you can imagine I was almost crazy I made a fool of
myself I expect refused to believe her behaved disgracefully and at
last when I had to believe it threatened to run away and leave my work
and Trumet forever like a coward She made me stay

Did hey

Yes She showed me it was my duty to face the music When I whimpered
about my troubles she told me her own story Then I learned what trouble
was and what pluck was too She told me about her marriage andexcuse
me for speaking of what isnt my business yet it is mine in a wayshe
told me about you

Captain Hammond did not answer His good natured face clouded and he
shifted in his chair

She told me of you Nat all about youand herself And she told me
something else which explains why she felt she must send you away why
she thought your marriage to Grace would be a good thing

I know She told you that that darn scamp Anse Coffin was alive

The minister started violently He gasped in surprise

You knew it You KNEW it he stammered

I know it now Have known it for over a year My findin it out was one
of the special Providences thats been helpin along this last voyage of
mine My second mate was a Hyannis man name of Cahoon One day on
that pesky island when we was eatin dinner together he says to me
Capn he says youre from Trumet aint you I owned up Know
anybody named Coffin there says he I owned up to that too Well
he says I met her husband last trip I was in the Glory of the Wave
I stared at him Met his ghost you mean I says Hes been dead
for years and a good thing too Fell overboard and not bein used to
water it killed him

But he wouldnt have it so I used to know Anse Coffin in New
Bedford he says Knew him wells I know you And when we was in port
at Havre I dropped in at a gin mill down by the water front and he come
up and touched me on the arm I thought same as you that he was dead
but he want He was three sheets in the wind and a reglar dock rat to
look at but twas him sure enough We had a long talk He said he was
comin back to Trumet some day Had a wife there he said I told him
sarcastic that shed be glad to see him He laughed and said maybe not
but that she knew he was alive and sent him money when he was hard up
Wanted me to promise not to tell any Cape folks that Id seen him and I
aint till now

Well you can imagine how I felt when Cahoon spun me that yarn First
I wouldnt blieve it and then I did It explained things just as you
say John I could see now why Keziah gave me my walkin papers I could
see how shed been sacrificin her life for that scum

Yes She wouldnt divorce him She said she had taken him for better or
worse and must stand by him I tried to show her she was wrong but it
was no use She did say she would never live with him again

I should say not LIVE with him By the everlastin if he ever comes
within reach of my hands thentheres times when good honest murder is
justifiable and righteous and itll be done Itll be done you hear
me

He looked as if he meant it Ellery asked another question

Did you tell herAunt Keziahwhen you met her at the Narrows he
asked

No But I shall tell her when I see her again She shant spoil her
lifea woman like that by the Lord WHAT a womanfor any such crazy
notion I swore it when I heard the story and Ive sworn it every day
since Thats what settled my mind about Grace Keziah Coffin belongs
to me She always has belonged to me even though my own pigheadedness
lost her in the old days

She cares for you Nat I know that She as much as told me so

Thank you John Thank you Well I can wait now I can wait for
Ive got something sure to wait for I tell you Ellery I aint a
churchgoin mannot as dad was anywaybut I truly believe that this
thing is goin to come out right God wont let that cussed rascal live
much longer He wont I know it But if he does if he lives a thousand
years Ill take her from him

He was pacing the floor now his face set like granite Ellery rose his
own face beaming Here was his chance At last he could pay to this man
and Keziah a part of the debt he owed

Nat stopped in his stride Well he exclaimed I almost forgot after
all Keziah sent a note to you Ive got it in my pocket She gave it to
me when she left me at Cohasset

Left you Why didnt she come back with you on the night train

No Thats funny too and I dont understand it yet We was together
all the afternoon I was feelin so good at seein her that I took her
under my wing and we cruised all over that town together Got dinner at
the tavern and she went with me to buy myself a new hat and all that
At first she didnt seem to want to but then after Id coaxed a while
she did She was lookin pretty sad and worn out when I first met her
I thought but she seemed to get over it and we had a fine time It
reminded me of the days when I used to get home from a voyage and we
were together Then when twas time for the night train we went down to
the depot She gave me this note and told me to hand it to you today

Goodby Nat she says Weve had a nice day havent we

We have for a fact I says But what are you sayin goodby for

Because Im not goin to Trumet with you says she Im goin to the
city Ive got some business to see to there Goodby

I was set back with all my canvas flappin I told her Id go to
Boston with her and wed come home to Trumet together tomorrow
thats today But she said no I must come here and ease your mind and
Graces I must do it So at last I agreed to sayin Id see her in a
little while She went on the up train and I took the down one Hired
a team in Sandwich and another in Bayport and got to the tavern about
eleven Thats the yarn And heres your note Maybe it tells where
shes gone and why

The minister took the note and tore open the envelope Within was a
single sheet of paper He read a few lines stopped and uttered an
exclamation

Whats the matter asked the captain

Ellery did not answer He read the note through and then without a
word handed it to his friend

The note was as follows


DEAR JOHN

I am going away as I told you I would if he came He is coming
Tuesday I got a letter from him It was written at Kingston Jamaica
almost three months ago I cant think why I havent got it sooner but
suppose it was given to some one to mail and forgotten In it he said
he was tired of going to sea and was coming home to me I had money
he said and we could get along He had shipped aboard a brig bound
for Savannah and from there he was going to try for a berth on a
Bostonbound vessel So I am going away and not coming back I could not
stand the disgrace and I could not see him You and Grace wont need me
any more now Dont worry about me I can always earn a living while I
have my strength Please dont worry If he comes tell him I have gone
you do not know where That will be true for you dont I hope you will
be very happy I do hope so Oh John you dont know how I hate to do
this but I must Dont tell Nat He would do something terrible to him
if he came and Nat knew Just say I have been called away and may be
back some time Perhaps I may Love to you all Goodby

Yours truly

KEZIAH COFFIN


The captain stared at the note Then he threw it to the floor and
started for the door The minister sprang from his chair and called to
him

Nat he cried Nat Stop where are you going

Hammond turned

Goin he growled Goin Im goin to find her first of all Then
Im comin back to wait for him

But you wont have to wait Hell never come Hes dead

Dead DEAD By the everlastin this has been too much for you I ought
to have known it Ill send the doctor here right off I cant stay
myself Ive got to go But

Listen listen to me Ansel Coffin is dead I tell you I know it I
know all about it That was what I wanted to see you about Did Keziah
tell you of the San Jose and the sailor who died of smallpox in this
very building In that room there

Yes John you

Im not raving Its the truth That sailor was Ansel Coffin I watched
with him and one night the night before he died he spoke Keziahs
name He spoke of New Bedford and of Trumet and of her over and over
again I was sure who he was then but I called in Ebenezer Capen who
used to know Coffin in New Bedford And he recognized him Nat as sure
as you and I are here this minute Ansel Coffin Aunt Keziahs husband
is buried in the Trumet cemetery


CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH MR STONE WASHES HIS HANDS


Mr Abner Stone of Stone  Barker marine outfitters and ship
chandlers with a place of business on Commercial Street in Boston and
a bank account which commanded respect throughout the city was feeling
rather irritable and out of sorts Poor relations are always a nuisance
They are forever expecting something either moneyin Mr Stones case
this particular expectation was usually fruitlessor employment or
influence or something Mr Stone was rich he had become so by his own
ability and unaided effort He was sure of thatoften mentioned it
with more or less modesty in the speeches which he delivered to his
Sundayschool class and at the dinners of various societies to which he
belonged He was a selfmade man and was conscious that he had done a
good job

Therefore being selfmade he saw no particular reason why he should
aid in the making of others If people were poor they ought to get over
it Poverty was a disease and he was no doctor He had been poor once
himself and no one had helped him I helped myself he was wont to
say with pride Some of his rivals in business repeating this remark
smiled and added that he had been helping himself ever since

Mr Stone had washed his hands of his cousin Keziah Coffin or
thought he had After her brother Solomon died she had written to him
asking him to find her a position of some kind in Boston I dont want
money I dont want charity wrote Keziah What I want is work Can
you get it for me Abner I write to you because father used to tell of
what you said to him about gratitude and how you would never rest until
you had done something in return for what he did for you

Captain Ben Halls kindness was the one thing Mr Stone forgot when he
said no one had ever helped him He disliked to be reminded of it It
was a long while ago and the captain was dead However being reminded
he had called upon a friend in the tailoring line and had obtained for
Keziah the place of sewing woman She decided to become housekeeper at
the Trumet parsonage and so notified him Then he washed his hands of
her

But now he was compelled to soil them again Keziah had appeared at
his office without warning and demanded that he find her a position
Demanded was the proper word Certainly she had not begged She seemed
to feel that her demand was right and proper and his acceding to it the
least he could do

What a fine place youve got here Abner she said inspecting the
office and the store I declare its finer than the one you had when
you first went into business afore you failed I wish father could have
lived to see it Hed have realized that his judgment was good even
though his investment wasnt

Captain Hall had invested largely in that first business the one which
failed Mr Stone changed the subject Later in the day he again sought
his friend the tailor and Keziah was installed in the loft of the
latters Washington Street shop beside the other women and girls who
sewed and sewed from seven in the morning until six at night Mr Stone
had left her there and come away feeling that an unpleasant matter
was disposed of He had made some inquiries as to where she intended
staying even added a halfhearted invitation to dinner that evening at
his home But she declined

No thank you Abner she said Im goin to find a boardin place
and Id just as soon nobody knew where I was stayin for the present
And theres one thing I want to ask you dont tell a soul I am here
Not a soul If anyone should come askin for me dont give em any
satisfaction Ill tell you why some day perhaps I cant now

This was what troubled Mr Stone as he sat in his office Why should
this woman wish to have her whereabouts kept a secret There was a
reason for this of course Was it a respectable reason or the other
kind If the latter his own name might be associated with the scandal
He wished for the fiftieth time that there were no poor relations

A boy came into the office There is some one here to see you Mr
Stone he said

Who is it

I dont know sir Looks like a seafaring man a sea captain I should
saybut he wont give his name Says its important and nobody but
youll do

Humph All right Tell him to wait Ill be out in a minute

Sea captains and ship owners were Stone  Barkers best customers The
senior partner emerged from the office with a smile on his face

Ah he said extending his hand Glad to see you Captainer

Hammond replied the visitor Same to you Mr Stone

Fine weather for this time of year

Fine enough Mr Stone

Well Captain Hammond what can we do for you Going to sail soon

Not right away Just made port lessn a week ago Home looks good to
me for a spell anyhow

So Yes I have no doubt Let me seewhere is your home captain I
should remember of course but

Dont know why you should This is my first trip in your latitude I
guess My homes at Trumet

Trumet Mr Stones tone changed

Yes Trumet down on the Cape Ever been there We think its about as
good a place as there is

Huum Trumet Well Captain Hammond you wished to see me I
understand

Yes Fact is Mr Stone I want to ask you where I can find Mrs Keziah
Coffin Shes a relation of yours I blieve and shes come to Boston
lately Only yesterday or the day afore Can you tell me where she is

Why do you wish to see her

Oh for reasons personal ones Shes a friend of mine

I see No captain I cant tell you where she is Good morning

Captain Nat was greatly disappointed

Hold on there just a minute he begged This is important you
understand Mr Stone Im mighty anxious to find KeziMrs Coffin We
thought some of her friends and I that most likely youd know where
she was Cant you give us any help at all Hasnt she been here

Good morning Captain Hammond You must excuse me Im busy

He went into the office and closed the door Captain Nat rubbed his
forehead desperately He had been almost sure that Abner Stone would put
him on Keziahs track Grace had thought so too She remembered what
the housekeeper had told concerning her Boston cousin and how the latter
had found employment for her when she contemplated leaving Trumet after
her brothers death Grace believed that Keziah would go to him at once

Nat walked to the door and stood there trying to think what to do next
A smart young person wearing a conspicuous suit of clothes aided and
abetted by a vivid waistcoat and a pair of youthful but promising side
whiskers came briskly along the sidewalk and stopped in front of him

Well sir observed this person with cheerful condescension
Anything I can do for you

Captain Nat turned his gaze upon the side whiskers and the waistcoat

Hey he queried

I say is there anything I can do for you

The captain shook his head Noo he drawled dryly Im afraid not
son I admit that dont seem scarcely possible but I am afraid its
so

Looking for something in our line was you

Well I dont know What might be on your lineclothes

The bewhiskered one drew himself up I am connected with Stone 
Barker he said sharply And seeing you standing in our doorway I
thought possibly

Yes yes Beg your pardon Im sure No I dont want to buy anything
I come to see Mr Stone on a personal matter

Hes busy I suppose

So he says

The young man smiled with serene satisfaction Im not surprised he
observed complacently We ARE a busy house Mrer

Hammonds my name Are you Mr Barker

Noo my name is Prince

So Silent partner in the firm hey

Noo not exactly Mr Prince was slightly embarrassed No I am aa
salesmanat present Was the matter you wished to see Mr Stone about a
very private one

Middlin

Well I asked because Mr Stone is a busy man and we like to save him
all thethe

Trouble you can hey Thats nice of you you must save him a lot
MrerKing was it

No Prince

Sure and sartin Prince of course I knew twas connected with the
royal family Well Mr Prince Im afraid even you cant help me nor
him out this time Im lookin up a friend of mine a widow lady from
down the Cape Shes a relation of Mr Stones and shes come to Boston
durin the last day or so I thought likely he might know where she was
thats all That would be a little out of your latitude hey

I dont know Her name wasnt Coffin was it

Captain Nat started It certainly was he answered eagerly Howd you
know that

Mr Princes complacence was superb Oh he answered with
condescension Mr Stone trusts me with a good many of his personal
affairs

I should think likely he would But about Mrs Coffin You was goin to
say

She is with James Hallett  Co the tailors on Washington Street Mr
Stone found a place for her there I believe Ierersuperintended
the carrying of her valise andWhat

Nothin nothin Hum Hallett  Co tailors What number Washinton
Street did you say

Mr Prince gave the number

Thank you a lot said Captain Nat with fervor Goodby Mr Prince
Hope the next time I come youll be in the firm Good day sir

Good day Nothing else I can do And you wont wait for Mr Stone Very
good Is there any message for him that you would like to leave

Hey Nat had started to go but now he paused and turned There was
a grim twinkle in his eye Message he repeated Why yees I dont
know but there is You just give Mr Stone Capn Hammonds compliments
and tell him Im lookin forward to interviewin him some time Just
tell him that will you

Ill tell him Glad to have met you Captain Hammond

The captain nodded solemnly Say Mr King he said you aint half
so glad as I am

Mr Prince strutted into the store

Who was that chap you were talking with asked a fellowclerk

Oh a hayseed who wanted to see the old man Poor relation I guess
I headed him off Stone is always telling us that time is money so I
saved both of em for him He ought to thank me Wouldnt be surprised
if I got the raise Ive been asking for

Mr Prince did not get the raise nor the thanks But he was surprised


In the workshop of Hallett  Co Keziah sat sewing busily The window
near her was closed stuck fast and through the dingy panes she could
see only roofs and chimneys The other women and girls near her
chatted and laughed but she was silent She did not feel like talking
certainly not like laughing The garment she was at work on was a coat
a wedding coat so the foreman had told her with a smile therefore she
must be very particular

She wondered idly whose coat it might be and who its future wearer was
to marry This reminded her of the minister and Grace They would be
happy now her talk with Nat had assured her of that and they too
would be married one of these days But she would not attend the
wedding She wondered what John had said when he read her note He and
Grace would be sorry for her of course but there was nothing they
could do to help No one could help her no one Perhaps by this time
the man she had run away from had reached Trumet and her secret was
known How Didama and the rest would spread the tale How Captain
Elkanah and Annabel would sneer and exult They hated her because she
was the ministers friend And Nat poor fellow what would he do Well
at least he would understand now

The narrow stairway leading up to the workshop ended in a little
boxedin room where the finished garments were hung to await the final
pressing From behind the closed door of this room came the sound of
voices apparently in heated argument One of these voices was that of
Larry the errand boy Larry was speaking shrilly and with emphasis The
other voice was lower in key and the words were inaudible

No sir you cant declared Larry You cant I tell you The boss
dont let nobody in there andHold on Hold on

The other voice made a short but evidently earnest answer Larry again
expostulated The workers looked up from their sewing The door opened
and Larry appeared flushed and excited

Wheres Mr Upham he demanded Mr Upham

Upham was the foreman of the workroom At the moment he was downstairs
in conversation with the head of the house A half dozen gave this
information

Whats the matter Who is it asked several

I dont know who tis Its a man and hes crazy I think I told him
he couldnt come in here but he just keeps comin He wants to see
somebody named Coffin and there aint no Coffins here

Keziah bent lower over the wedding coat Her hand shook and she dropped
the needle

I told him we didnt keep coffins declared Larry This aint no
undertakers Wheres Mr Upham

Keziahs nearest neighbor leaned toward her

I guess its somebody to see you she said Your name is Coffin
aint it

No no That is it cant be anybody to see me I dont want to see
anybody Tell him so whoever it is I cant see anybody INAT

He stood in the doorway beckoning to her

Keziah he said come here I want you Ill tell you why in a
minute Come

She hesitated In a measure she was relieved for she had feared the
man at the door might be her husband But she was greatly agitated and
troubled Everyone in the place was looking at her

Nat she said trying to speak firmly I cant see you now Im very
busy Please go away

Come

I cant come Go away Please

Keziah Im waitin And Im goin to wait if I stay here all night
Come

She obeyed then She could not have a scene there before all those
strangers She stepped past him into the little room He followed and
closed the door

Nat she said turning to him why did you come How could you be so
cruel I

He interrupted her but not with words The next moment his arms were
about her and she was pressed tight against the breast of his blue
jacket

Keziah he whispered Ive come to take you home Home for good No
stay where you are and Ill tell you all about it Praise be to God
were off the rocks at last All thats left is to tow you into port
and by the everlastin thats what Im here for


When Upham came up the stairs after his long interview with the boss
he found the door at the top closed When he rattled the latch that door
was opened by a stranger

Are you Mr Hallett asked Captain Nat briskly

No Im not Mr Hallett is in his office on the first floor But
what

On the main deck hey Well all right we wont trouble him Youll
do just as well I judge youre one of the mates of this craft You tell
Mr Hallett that this lady here has decided not to cruise with him any
longer No fault to find you understand but shes got a better berth
Shes goin to ship along with me Aint that so Keziah

Keziah pale trembling scarcely realizing the situation even yet
did not speak But Captain Nat Hammond seemed to find his answer in her
silence A few minutes later her arm in his they descended the gloomy
dusty stairs and emerged into the sunshine together

That afternoon Mr Abner Stone again washed his hands of his poor
relationthis time as he indignantly declared for good and all


CHAPTER XXII

IN WHICH KEZIAHS PARSON PREACHES ONCE MORE


Time has wrought many changes in Trumet The packet long since ceased to
ply between the village and Boston the stage has been superseded by
the locomotive the old squareriggers commanded by Cape Cod men no
longer sail the seas Along the main road the houses have changed hands
Didama Rogers peers no more from her parlor window that parlor is now
profaned by the frivolous and irreverent summer boarder But the old
residents love to talk of the days that are gone and if you happen to
catch Mr Isaac Higgins now postmaster and a dignified member of the
board of selectmen in a reminiscent mood he will very likely tell you
of the meeting of the parish committee called by its chairman Elkanah
Daniels to oust the Rev John Ellery from the pulpit of the Regular
church

Ill never forget says Mr Higgins that parish committee meetin if
I live a thousand year I and two or three other young shavers was hid
in the little room off the vestrythe room where they kept the dishes
they used for church suppersand we heard the whole business Of course
nobody knew that Nat was goin to marry Keziah then but they did know
that he want goin to marry Grace Van Horne and had given her up
to the minister of his own accord So Danielss guns was spiked and he
didnt stand no chance at all However youd never have guessed it
to look at him He marched into that meetin and up to the platform as
stiff and dignified as if hed swallered a peck of starch He called
the meetin to ordertwas a full one for all hands and the cook was
thereand then got up to speak

He opened fire right off He raked John Ellery fore and aft The
parson he said had disgraced the society and his sacred profession
and should be hove overboard immediate Twas an open secret he said
Everybody knew how he minister of a Reglar church had been carryin
on with a ComeOuter girl meetin her unbeknownst to anyone and so on
As he got warmed up on this subject he got more bitter and though he
didnt come out open and say slanderous things his hints was as nigh
that as a pigs snout is to his squeal Even through the crack of the
dishcloset door I could see the bristles risin on the back of Capn
Zeb Mayos neck

At last Capn Zeb couldnt stand it no longer

Belay there he sings out jumpin to his feet I want to ask you
one question Elkanah Daniels Are you tryin to say somethin against
Grace Van Hornes character

Well that was a sort of sticker in a way and I callate Daniels
realized it He humhad and barked a little and then give in that he
couldnt swear the Van Horne persons character want all right but

Couldnt swear snorts Zeb You better not try to not when the
minister or Nats around Aw belay you want us to fire John Ellery
out of this societythe best minister it ever had or ever will
havebecause he had the sense to get sweet on a good clean girl and the
spunk to ask her to marry him And youre down on her because shes been
brought up in a ComeOuter familyat least thats the reason you give
out though some of us have suspicions taint the real one Why she
risked what she thought was smallpox to keep him from dyin that night
she picked him up ravin distracted in the middle of the lighthouse
lane and if he hadnt married her after that I for one would have
been willin to vote to give him his walkin papers ComeOuter she may
have been but by time shes got religion thats good enough for me
and Ill be proud to see her the wife of my minister Dont lets have
no more chin music We know what you want and what you called this
meetin for now lets vote on it

Three or four sung out Question and Vote But Elkanah held up his
hand

Gentlemen says he before I ask for the vote I want to say just one
word Ive worshiped in this meetin house ever sence I was a child I
was christened in it my father worshiped here afore me Ive presided
over the meetins of this body for years But I tell you now that if you
vote to keep that rascally hypocrite in your pulpit I shall resign from
the committee and from the society Itll be like cuttin off my right
hand but I shall do it Are you ready for the vote Those in favor of
retaining the present minister of this parish will rise Those opposed
will remain seated

Every man on the floor stood up Daniels himself was the only one that
stayed settin down

It is a vote says he white as a sheet and his voice trembling
Gentlemen I bid you good day

He took up his hat and cane give one look around the vestry as if
he was sayin goodby to it and marched down the aisle as straight and
starchy as hed come into it Only when he reached the door he put up
one hand as if he was steadyin himself There was precious few in that
vestry that liked Elkanah Daniels but Im bettin high there want a
one who didnt feel sorry for him then

Twas quiet as could be for a minute or so after hed gone Then Capn
Zeb draws a big breath and flings up his hand

Shipmates says he this is the Almightys house and weve got to do
it quiet but I propose three whisperin cheers for the Rev John Ellery
and the lady thats goin to be his wife

So they give emhearty too if they was whisperedand thats all
there is to that meetin worth tellin about

Captain Daniels and his daughter moved to Boston that summer They never
came back to Trumet to live Annabel remained single until after her
fathers death then she married a man very much younger and poorer
than she was It was remarked by acquaintances of the couple that the
difference in age became less and less apparent as their married life
continued

Humph observed Captain Zeb summing up the situation he started
about ten year astern but hell beat her on the run into the cemetery
now you mark my words Annabels tempers callated to keep any average
chap drivin on that course bows under Theres a threereef breeze
blowin off her tongue day and night

On a Sunday morning a few weeks after the committee meeting the
Regular church was crowded John Ellery was to preach his first sermon
since the San Jose came ashore Every member of the congregation was
present Even Mrs Prince feeble but garrulous was there Gaius
Winslow having delivered his brood of children at the church door made
a special trip in his carryall to fetch the old lady Captain Zebedee
and Mrs Mayo beamed from their pew Dr Parker and his wife smiled at
them across the aisle Didama Rogerss new bonnet was a work of art and
her neck threatened to twist itself off as she turned to see each one
who came in

Lavinia Pepper sailed to the front She was dressed in a new black
alpaca which rustled so very much like silk that nearsighted people
might have been deceived by it With her was a man apparently suffering
from strangulation because of the height and tightness of his collar
Its Caleb Pratt from Sandwich whispered Didama Thankful Paynes
relation you know Have you heard what folks are sayin I guess
its true becauseLook at Kyan youd think he was goin to his own
funeral

Abishais expression was not cheerful certainly He followed Mr Pratt
and his sister to the Pepper pew and subsided sadly in the corner next
the wall Occasionally he was observed to wipe his forehead and onceit
was during the prayerhe groaned audibly Lavinias dig in the ribs
prevented his repeating the sound but judging by his looks he
continued to groan in spirit

There was a stir at the door All heads swung in that directionall but
Mr Peppers that is The minister and Grace were coming up the aisle
and behind them came Captain Nat Hammond and Keziah Coffin Nat was
smiling and selfpossessed Never before in his life had he entered the
Regular meeting house as a worshiper but he seemed to be bearing the
ordeal bravely It was Graces first visit to the church also and she
was plainly embarrassed To be stared at by eightyodd pairs of eyes
and to catch whispered comments from the starers tongues is likely to
embarrass one

Yet the comments were all friendly

I declare whispered Mrs Prince I never see her look so pretty
afore I knew she was the best lookin girl in this town but I never
realized she was SUCH a beauty Well theres one thing sartinweve
got the handsomest parson and parsons wife in THIS county by about ten
mile and four rows of apple trees And theres the other bride thats
goin to be I never see Keziah look so well neither

Keziah did look well Her parson had emerged triumphant from his battle
with disease and adverse fate and was more than ever the idol of his
congregation He was to marry the girl of his choiceand hers The
housekeepers ears were still ringing with the thanks of John and Grace
Both seemed to feel that to her Keziah Coffin more than anyone else
they owed their great joy Some of the things they said she would never
forget And her own life too was freed forever of its burden the
secret which had hung over her for so many years Only a very few knew
that secret and they would not disclose it Toward the memory of the
man buried in the strangers lot at the cemetery she felt almost
kindly now While he lived she had feared and dreaded him now she was
beginning to forgive For he had paid his debt with his life and with
her beside her was the other the one whom she had loved had given
up had mourned for and who was now to be hers always No wonder Keziah
looked well She was happy and happiness is a wondrous beautifier

The minister went up the stairs to the pulpit He was still white and
thin but his eyes were bright and his voice clear He gave out the
opening hymn and the service began

They said it was the finest sermon ever preached in that church and
perhaps it was When it was over before the benediction was pronounced
Ellery stepped out from behind the pulpit to the edge of the platform
He looked over the friendly faces upturned to his and for an instant
it seemed that he could not trust himself to speak

My friends he said I cannot let you go without a personal word I
owe you so much all of you that nothing I can say will convey to you
my feeling of gratitude and love for this congregation and this church
You have stood by me all through You trusted me and believed in me I
came to Trumet a stranger I have found here the truest friends a man
could hope to findyes and more than friends If I live and while
I live I shall hope to prove by the best effort that is in me my
realization of the great debt I owe you and my desire to repay it even
though the payment must of necessity be so inadequate God bless you
alland thank you

Want it lovely gushed Didama And when he said that about true
friends he was lookin straight at Gracie all the time

Didnt seem to me so declared Gaius Winslow I thought he was
lookin at Capn Hammond

Well now thats queer put in Mrs Parker the doctors wife I
would have sworn he was looking at Keziah Coffin

Captain Zebedee grinned I callate youre all right he observed I
wouldnt wonder if he was lookin at all of em

There was much hand shaking and congratulation and the church emptied
slowly Among the last to leave were the Peppers and Mr Pratt Lavinia
took the minister aside

Mr Ellery she simpered Ivethat is Caleb and mewill probly
want you toThat is we want you to be the one

Yes Miss Pepper

Oh my sakes you seeBishy dear come here a minute wont you

Kyan approached the picture of desolation

What do you want he asked gruffly

Heavens to Betsy Dont look so sour A bodyd think you was goin
to be hung to look at you Bishy you tell Mr Ellery all about it
theres a dear Hell tell you Mr Ellery and remember we count on
you Neither me nor Caleb wont have nobody else

She seized Mr Pratt by the arm and led him hastily away Kyan looked
after them

Hung he muttered I wish by godfreys mighty I had the hangin of
SOME folks Id put a tighter collar on em than theyve got now I bet
you

The ministers lips twitched He knew what was coming Hints of a
surprising nature had been circulating about Trumet

Whats the matter Mr Pepper he asked

Matter Matter enough You know what shes goin to do Shes goin to
marry THAT

The last word was emphasized by a furious gesticulation toward the back
of the gentleman from Sandwich

Who Mr Pratt Is your sister to marry him Indeed I congratulate
them bothand you

Me What in tunketI ask your pardon Mr Ellery for talkin so in
the meetin housebut what are you congratulatin me for

Why because your sister is to have a good husband at least people
speak highly of him

Ugh

And becausewell Mr Pepper you have been quite confidential with
me we have shared secrets you know and I thought possibly the new
arrangement might make it a bit more pleasant for you

Pleasant How

I suppose Mr Pratt will take his bride home to Sandwich and you
being here alone will be more free

Free Kyan repeated the word wrathfully Free Ill be about as free
as a settin hen under a barrel I will Is a feller free when hes
got two pickin at him instead of one I thought I was goin to have a
little peace and comfort I thought that same as you Mr Ellery Ive
had my suspicions as to her and him for some time That day when I
callated Id locked her up and come back to find shed gone buggy
ridin I thought twas queer When she went to conference and left
me alone I smelt a rat When she took to letter writin the smell got
stronger until the last few weeks Ive been sartin of the game she was
up to And I never complained no sir Some brothers would have ripped
up the eternal foundations afore theyd have let their sister break
up their home and desert em for a stiffnecked baldheaded old shoe
peddler like

Hush hush Mr Pepper You forget

No I dont forget nuther Mr Ellery you dont know it all When
Laviny come to me and told me what she was goin to do was I obstinate
Did I stand on my rights as head of the family and tell her she couldnt
do it No siree I didnt I was resigned I says to her Laviny
I says I wont say that I shant be turrible lonesome without you I
wont say that I aint sort of shocked and grieved at our partin after
all these years But whats my personal feelins when I compare em with
your happiness Nothin nothin at all I says Bless you Laviny
says I When you goin to go away And what do you spose she says to
me Why that she want goin away at all Thatthat Pratt thing
has sold out his shoe store up to Sandwich and is comin here to live
Comin to live at our HOUSE mind you with her and with ME Twill be
so nice for you Bishy dear she says to have a man in the house
to keep you compny and look out for you when I aint round Godfreys
mighty

This portion of Kyans disclosure was surprising if the announcement of
his sisters engagement was not

Mr Pratt is coming to Trumet the minister repeated What for What
is he going to do here

Keep shoe store I spose likely Laviny says theres a good openin
for one in this town I told her the best openin I could think of for
him was the well and I hoped to the nation hed fall into it Then she
went for me like a dogfish after a herrin and I never had a taste of
vittles till Id took it all back and said I was glad he was goin to
live with us Free Dont talk to me about freedom Godfreys mighty

Ellery smothered his desire to laugh and expressed sympathy Abishai
listened in sullen silence

Well he said turning to go I aint goin to stand it if I can
help it Ive been doin some thinkin on my own account and theres
two ways of gettin even That Caleb critter is marryin into our family
cause he knows Im well off Ill cheat him by godfreys Ill will
every cent of my fifteen hundred dollars to the poor or the heathen or
somethin I will sures taxes

The minister was obliged to laugh then

I wouldnt do that he said From what I hear Mr Pratt is worth
several times fifteen hundred

I know it but hes so dum mean that twould break his heart to see
even ten cents gettin away from him However that aint my only plan
He and Laviny aint got any mortgage on the marryin business
Other folks can do it as well as them What do you think of Hannah
Poundberry

What do I think of her What do you mean

Never mind what I mean Just you keep that in your head Mr Ellery
You remember that I asked you as man to man What do you think of
Hannah PoundberryYes yes Laviny Im acomin They want me to
ask you to marry em he added I spose youll have to But say Mr
Ellery when you do just tell Pratt that your usual price for the
job is ten dollars Thatll spile his honeymoon for him or I miss my
guess

He turned away and moved sulkily toward his beckoning sister and her
escort but wheeled once more to add in a mysterious whisper Dont
you forget now Mr Ellery Remember that question I put to you What
do you think ofYes yes Laviny I hear youof you know who


That evening at the parsonage Keziah was clearing the table and
Captain Nat was helping her A happy party of four had enjoyed the meal
John and Mrs Coffin acting as hosts and Grace and the captain being the
invited guests Now the younger couple had gone over to the church the
bell of which was ringing for evening service

Hurry up Keziah urged Nat If you and me dont get decks cleared
pretty soon well be late for meetin and Id hate to do that
considerin Im such a brandnew disciple as you might say What do we
do next shorten sail Like this hey

He pulled the cloth from the table sending the crumbs flying in all
directions and proceeded to fold it after a fashion

There he exclaimed with satisfaction there she is canvas furled
and under bare poles Now we can clear out cant we Whats the
matter

Keziah took the cloth from his hands and refolded it

Nat Hammond she said laughing you may be a good sailor but youre
an awful poor housekeeper Look at the mess youve made of that floor

Nat looked at the scattered crumbs and shook his head

By the everlastin he observed I did make dirty weather on that
tack didnt I Callate I aint much of a housekeeper same as you say
Maybe thats why I was so dreadful anxious to get a good one to cruise
along with me Well Ive got her Im satisfied

He walked to the back door of the kitchen threw it open and stood
looking out

Keziah he said come here a minute

She came from the dining room and stood at his side He put an arm about
her

Look off there he said pointing with his free hand See that

The sun was just setting and all the west was gorgeous with crimson and
purple and yellow The bay was spangled with fire the high sand bluffs
along the shore looked like broken golden ingots The fields and swamps
and salt meadows rich in their spring glory of bud and new leaf were
tinged with the ruddy glow The Trumet roofs were bathed in it the
old packet asleep at her moorings by the breakwater was silhouetted
against the radiance The church bell had ceased to ring and there was
not a sound except the low music of the distant surf

Look at it Keziah urged Captain Nat

Im lookin Nat she answered Its beautiful

Aint it I love it you know that and I never thought I should be
anxious for the time to come when I must leave it But I am I want to
go

They were to be married in another month It would be a double wedding
for Grace and the minister were to be married at the same time Then Nat
and his wife were to go to New York where a new ship just out of
the builders hands was to be ready for him She was a fine one this
successor to the Sea Mist She had been building for more than a year
and when Captain Hammond returned safe and sound and with their money
in his possession the owners decided at once that he should command the
addition to their fleet She was to sail for Liverpool and Keziah was to
be a passenger

I cant hardly wait to get to sea went on Nat Think of it No more
lonesome meals in the cabin thinkin about you and about home No sir
you and homell be right aboard with me Think of the fun well have in
the foreign ports London and you and me goin sightseein through it
And Havre and Gibraltar and Marseilles and Genoa andandby and by
Calcutta and Hong Kong and Singapore Ive seen em all of course but
you havent I tell you Keziah that time when I first saw a real hope
of gettin you that time after Id learned from John that that big
trouble of yours was out of the way forever on my way up to Boston in
the cars I made myself a promiseI swore that if you did say yes to me
Id do my best to make the rest of your life as smooth and pleasant as
the past so far had been rough I aint rich enough to give you what you
deserve nowhere near but Ill work hard and do my best my girlyou
see

Keziah was looking out over the bay her eyes brighter than the sunset
Now she turned to look up into his face

Rich she repeated with a little catch in her voice Rich there
never was a woman in this world so rich as I am this minute Or so
happy either

remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
