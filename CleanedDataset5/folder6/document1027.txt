THE LONE STAR RANGER

By Zane Grey



 To
 CAPTAIN JOHN HUGHES
 and his Texas Rangers


It may seem strange to you that out of all the stories I heard on the
Rio Grande I should choose as first that of Buck Duaneoutlaw and
gunman

But indeed Ranger Coffees story of the last of the Duanes has haunted
me and I have given full rein to imagination and have retold it in my
own way It deals with the old lawthe old border daystherefore it is
better first Soon perchance I shall have the pleasure of writing of
the border of today which in Joe Sitters laconic speech Shore is
most as bad an wild as ever

In the North and East there is a popular idea that the frontier of the
West is a thing long past and remembered now only in stories As I
think of this I remember Ranger Sitter when he made that remark while
he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound And I remember the giant
Vaughn that typical son of stalwart Texas sitting there quietly with
bandaged head his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had
ambushed him Only a few months have passed since thenwhen I had my
memorable sojourn with youand yet in that short time Russell and
Moore have crossed the Divide like Rangers

GentlemenI have the honor to dedicate this book to you and the
hope that it shall fall to my lot to tell the world the truth about a
strange unique and misunderstood body of menthe Texas Rangerswho
made the great Lone Star State habitable who never know peaceful rest
and sleep who are passing who surely will not be forgotten and will
some day come into their own

BOOK I THE OUTLAW



CHAPTER I

So it was in him thenan inherited fighting instinct a driving
intensity to kill He was the last of the Duanes that old fighting
stock of Texas But not the memory of his dead father nor the pleading
of his softvoiced mother nor the warning of this uncle who stood
before him now had brought to Buck Duane so much realization of
the dark passionate strain in his blood It was the recurrence a
hundredfold increased in power of a strange emotion that for the last
three years had arisen in him

Yes Cal Bains in town full of bad whisky an huntin for you
repeated the elder man gravely

Its the second time muttered Duane as if to himself

Son you cant avoid a meetin Leave town till Cal sobers up He aint
got it in for you when hes not drinkin

But whats he want me for demanded Duane To insult me again I
wont stand that twice

Hes got a fever thats rampant in Texas these days my boy He wants
gunplay If he meets you hell try to kill you

Here it stirred in Duane again that bursting gush of blood like a
wind of flame shaking all his inner being and subsiding to leave him
strangely chilled

Kill me What for he asked

Lord knows there aint any reason But whats that to do with most of
the shootin these days Didnt five cowboys over to Everalls kill
one another dead all because they got to jerkin at a quirt among
themselves An Cal has no reason to love you His girl was sweet on
you

I quit when I found out she was his girl

I reckon she aint quit But never mind her or reasons Cals here
just drunk enough to be ugly Hes achin to kill somebody Hes one of
them fourflush gunfighters Hed like to be thought bad Theres a lot
of wild cowboys whore ambitious for a reputation They talk about how
quick they are on the draw T hey ape Bland an King Fisher an Hardin
an all the big outlaws They make threats about joinin the gangs along
the Rio Grande They laugh at the sheriffs an brag about how theyd
fix the rangers Cals sure not much for you to bother with if you only
keep out of his way

You mean for me to run asked Duane in scorn

I reckon I wouldnt put it that way Just avoid him Buck Im not
afraid Cal would get you if you met down there in town Youve your
fathers eye an his slick hand with a gun What Im most afraid of is
that youll kill Bain

Duane was silent letting his uncles earnest words sink in trying to
realize their significance

If Texas ever recovers from that fool war an kills off these outlaws
why a young man will have a lookout went on the uncle Youre
twentythree now an a powerful sight of a fine fellow barrin your
temper Youve a chance in life But if you go gunfightin if you kill
a man youre ruined Then youll kill another Itll be the same old
story An the rangers would make you an outlaw The rangers mean law
an order for Texas This evenbreak business doesnt work with them If
you resist arrest theyll kill you If you submit to arrest then you go
to jail an mebbe you hang

Id never hang muttered Duane darkly

I reckon you wouldnt replied the old man Youd be like your
father He was ever ready to drawtoo ready In times like these with
the Texas rangers enforcin the law your Dad would have been driven to
the river An son Im afraid youre a chip off the old block Cant
you hold inkeep your temperrun away from trouble Because itll only
result in you gettin the worst of it in the end Your father was killed
in a streetfight An it was told of him that he shot twice after a
bullet had passed through his heart Think of the terrible nature of a
man to be able to do that If you have any such blood in you never give
it a chance

What you say is all very well uncle returned Duane but the only
way out for me is to run and I wont do it Cal Bain and his outfit
have already made me look like a coward He says Im afraid to come out
and face him A man simply cant stand that in this country Besides
Cal would shoot me in the back some day if I didnt face him

Well then whatre you goin to do inquired the elder man

I havent decidedyet

No but youre comin to it mighty fast That damned spell is workin
in you Youre different today I remember how you used to be moody an
lose your temper an talk wild Never was much afraid of you then But
now youre gettin cool an quiet an you think deep an I dont like
the light in your eye It reminds me of your father

I wonder what Dad would say to me today if he were alive and here
said Duane

What do you think What could you expect of a man who never wore a
glove on his right hand for twenty years

Well hed hardly have said much Dad never talked But he would have
done a lot And I guess Ill go downtown and let Cal Bain find me

Then followed a long silence during which Duane sat with downcast eyes
and the uncle appeared lost in sad thought of the future Presently he
turned to Duane with an expression that denoted resignation and yet a
spirit which showed wherein they were of the same blood

Youve got a fast horsethe fastest I know of in this country After
you meet Bain hurry back home Ill have a saddlebag packed for you and
the horse ready

With that he turned on his heel and went into the house leaving Duane
to revolve in his mind his singular speech Buck wondered presently if
he shared his uncles opinion of the result of a meeting between himself
and Bain His thoughts were vague But on the instant of final decision
when he had settled with himself that he would meet Bain such a storm
of passion assailed him that he felt as if he was being shaken with
ague Yet it was all internal inside his breast for his hand was like
a rock and for all he could see not a muscle about him quivered He
had no fear of Bain or of any other man but a vague fear of himself of
this strange force in him made him ponder and shake his head It was as
if he had not all to say in this matter There appeared to have been in
him a reluctance to let himself go and some voice some spirit from a
distance something he was not accountable for had compelled him
That hour of Duanes life was like years of actual living and in it he
became a thoughtful man

He went into the house and buckled on his belt and gun The gun was a
Colt45 sixshot and heavy with an ivory handle He had packed it
on and off for five years Before that it had been used by his father
There were a number of notches filed in the bulge of the ivory handle
This gun was the one his father had fired twice after being shot
through the heart and his hand had stiffened so tightly upon it in
the deathgrip that his fingers had to be pried open It had never been
drawn upon any man since it had come into Duanes possession But the
cold bright polish of the weapon showed how it had been used Duane
could draw it with inconceivable rapidity and at twenty feet he could
split a card pointing edgewise toward him

Duane wished to avoid meeting his mother Fortunately as he thought
she was away from home He went out and down the path toward the gate
The air was full of the fragrance of blossoms and the melody of birds
Outside in the road a neighbor woman stood talking to a countryman in a
wagon they spoke to him and he heard but did not reply Then he began
to stride down the road toward the town

Wellston was a small town but important in that unsettled part of the
great state because it was the tradingcenter of several hundred miles
of territory On the main street there were perhaps fifty buildings
some brick some frame mostly adobe and onethird of the lot and by
far the most prosperous were saloons From the road Duane turned into
this street It was a wide thoroughfare lined by hitchingrails and
saddled horses and vehicles of various kinds Duanes eye ranged down
the street taking in all at a glance particularly persons moving
leisurely up and down Not a cowboy was in sight Duane slackened his
stride and by the time he reached Sol Whites place which was the
first saloon he was walking slowly Several people spoke to him and
turned to look back after they had passed He paused at the door of
Whites saloon took a sharp survey of the interior then stepped
inside

The saloon was large and cool full of men and noise and smoke The
noise ceased upon his entrance and the silence ensuing presently broke
to the clink of Mexican silver dollars at a monte table Sol White who
was behind the bar straightened up when he saw Duane then without
speaking he bent over to rinse a glass All eyes except those of the
Mexican gamblers were turned upon Duane and these glances were keen
speculative questioning These men knew Bain was looking for trouble
they probably had heard his boasts But what did Duane intend to do
Several of the cowboys and ranchers present exchanged glances Duane had
been weighed by unerring Texas instinct by men who all packed guns The
boy was the son of his father Whereupon they greeted him and returned
to their drinks and cards Sol White stood with his big red hands out
upon the bar he was a tall rawboned Texan with a long mustache waxed
to sharp points

Howdy Buck was his greeting to Duane He spoke carelessly and
averted his dark gaze for an instant

Howdy Sol replied Duane slowly Say Sol I hear theres a gent in
town looking for me bad

Reckon there is Buck replied White He came in heah aboot an
hour ago Shore he was some riled an aroarin for gore Told me
confidential a certain party had given you a white silk scarf an he
was hellbent on wearin it home spotted red

Anybody with him queried Duane

Burt an Sam Outcalt an a little cowpuncher I never seen before
Theyall was coaxin trim to leave town But hes looked on the flowin
glass Buck an hes heah for keeps

Why doesnt Sheriff Oaks lock him up if hes that bad

Oaks went away with the rangers Theres been another raid at Fleshers
ranch The King Fisher gang likely An so the towns shore wide open

Duane stalked outdoors and faced down the street He walked the whole
length of the long block meeting many peoplefarmers ranchers
clerks merchants Mexicans cowboys and women It was a singular fact
that when he turned to retrace his steps the street was almost empty He
had not returned a hundred yards on his way when the street was wholly
deserted A few heads protruded from doors and around corners That main
street of Wellston saw some such situation every few days If it was an
instinct for Texans to fight it was also instinctive for them to sense
with remarkable quickness the signs of a coming gunplay Rumor could
not fly so swiftly In less than ten minutes everybody who had been on
the street or in the shops knew that Buck Duane had come forth to meet
his enemy

Duane walked on When he came to within fifty paces of a saloon he
swerved out into the middle of the street stood there for a moment
then went ahead and back to the sidewalk He passed on in this way the
length of the block Sol White was standing in the door of his saloon

Buck Im atippin you off he said quick and lowvoiced Cal
Bains over at Everalls If hes ahuntin you bad as he brags hell
show there

Duane crossed the street and started down Notwithstanding Whites
statement Duane was wary and slow at every door Nothing happened
and he traversed almost the whole length of the block without seeing a
person Everalls place was on the corner

Duane knew himself to be cold steady He was conscious of a strange
fury that made him want to leap ahead He seemed to long for this
encounter more than anything he had ever wanted But vivid as were his
sensations he felt as if in a dream

Before he reached Everalls he heard loud voices one of which was
raised high Then the short door swung outward as if impelled by a
vigorous hand A bowlegged cowboy wearing wooley chaps burst out upon
the sidewalk At sight of Duane he seemed to bound into the air and he
uttered a savage roar

Duane stopped in his tracks at the outer edge of the sidewalk perhaps a
dozen rods from Everalls door

If Bain was drunk he did not show it in his movement He swaggered
forward rapidly closing up the gap Red sweaty disheveled and
hatless his face distorted and expressive of the most malignant intent
he was a wild and sinister figure He had already killed a man and this
showed in his demeanor His hands were extended before him the right
hand a little lower than the left At every step he bellowed his rancor
in speech mostly curses Gradually he slowed his walk then halted A
good twentyfive paces separated the men

Wont nothin make you draw you he shouted fiercely

Im waitin on you Cal replied Duane

Bains right hand stiffenedmoved Duane threw his gun as a boy throws
a ball underhanda draw his father had taught him He pulled twice
his shots almost as one Bains big Colt boomed while it was pointed
downward and he was falling His bullet scattered dust and gravel at
Duanes feet He fell loosely without contortion

In a flash all was reality for Duane He went forward and held his gun
ready for the slightest movement on the part of Bain But Bain lay upon
his back and all that moved were his breast and his eyes How strangely
the red had left his faceand also the distortion The devil that had
showed in Bain was gone He was sober and conscious He tried to
speak but failed His eyes expressed something pitifully human They
changedrolledset blankly

Duane drew a deep breath and sheathed his gun He felt calm and cool
glad the fray was over One violent expression burst from him The
fool

When he looked up there were men around him

Plumb center said one

Another a cowboy who evidently had just left the gamingtable leaned
down and pulled open Bains shirt He had the ace of spades in his hand
He laid it on Bains breast and the black figure on the card covered
the two bulletholes just over Bains heart

Duane wheeled and hurried away He heard another man say

Reckon Cal got what he deserved Buck Duanes first gunplay Like
father like son



CHAPTER II

A thought kept repeating itself to Duane and it was that he might have
spared himself concern through his imagining how awful it would be to
kill a man He had no such feeling now He had rid the community of a
drunken bragging quarrelsome cowboy

When he came to the gate of his home and saw his uncle there with a
mettlesome horse saddled with canteen rope and bags all in place
a subtle shock pervaded his spirit It had slipped his mindthe
consequence of his act But sight of the horse and the look of his uncle
recalled the fact that he must now become a fugitive An unreasonable
anger took hold of him

The dd fool he exclaimed hotly Meeting Bain wasnt much Uncle
Jim He dusted my boots thats all And for that Ive got to go on the
dodge

Son you killed himthen asked the uncle huskily

Yes I stood over himwatched him die I did as I would have been done
by

I knew it Long ago I saw it comin But now we cant stop to cry over
spilt blood Youve got to leave town an this part of the country

Mother exclaimed Duane

Shes away from home You cant wait Ill break it to herwhat she
always feared

Suddenly Duane sat down and covered his face with his hands

My God Uncle what have I done His broad shoulders shook

Listen son an remember what I say replied the elder man
earnestly Dont ever forget Youre not to blame Im glad to see
you take it this way because maybe youll never grow hard an callous
Youre not to blame This is Texas Youre your fathers son These are
wild times The law as the rangers are laying it down now cant change
life all in a minute Even your mother whos a good true woman has
had her share in making you what you are this moment For she was one of
the pioneersthe fightin pioneers of this state Those years of wild
times before you was born developed in her instinct to fight to save
her life her children an that instinct has cropped out in you It
will be many years before it dies out of the boys born in Texas

Im a murderer said Duane shuddering

No son youre not An you never will be But youve got to be an
outlaw till time makes it safe for you to come home

An outlaw

I said it If we had money an influence wed risk a trial But weve
neither An I reckon the scaffold or jail is no place for Buckley
Duane Strike for the wild country an wherever you go an whatever
you dobe a man Live honestly if thats possible If it isnt be as
honest as you can If you have to herd with outlaws try not to become
bad There are outlaws who re not all badmany who have been driven to
the river by such a deal as this you had When you get among these men
avoid brawls Dont drink dont gamble I neednt tell you what to do
if it comes to gunplay as likely it will You cant come home When
this thing is lived down if that time ever comes Ill get word into
the unsettled country Itll reach you some day Thats all Remember
be a man Goodby

Duane with blurred sight and contracting throat gripped his uncles
hand and bade him a wordless farewell Then he leaped astride the black
and rode out of town

As swiftly as was consistent with a care for his steed Duane put a
distance of fifteen or eighteen miles behind him With that he slowed
up and the matter of riding did not require all his faculties He
passed several ranches and was seen by men This did not suit him and
he took an old trail across country It was a flat region with a poor
growth of mesquite and pricklypear cactus Occasionally he caught
a glimpse of low hills in the distance He had hunted often in that
section and knew where to find grass and water When he reached
this higher ground he did not however halt at the first favorable
campingspot but went on and on Once he came out upon the brow of a
hill and saw a considerable stretch of country beneath him It had the
gray sameness characterizing all that he had traversed He seemed to
want to see wide spacesto get a glimpse of the great wilderness lying
somewhere beyond to the southwest It was sunset when he decided to camp
at a likely spot he came across He led the horse to water and then
began searching through the shallow valley for a suitable place to camp
He passed by old campsites that he well remembered These however did
not strike his fancy this time and the significance of the change in
him did not occur at the moment At last he found a secluded spot under
cover of thick mesquites and oaks at a goodly distance from the old
trail He took saddle and pack off the horse He looked among his
effects for a hobble and finding that his uncle had failed to put one
in he suddenly remembered that he seldom used a hobble and never on
this horse He cut a few feet off the end of his lasso and used that
The horse unused to such hampering of his free movements had to be
driven out upon the grass

Duane made a small fire prepared and ate his supper This done ending
the work of that day he sat down and filled his pipe Twilight had
waned into dusk A few wan stars had just begun to show and brighten
Above the low continuous hum of insects sounded the evening carol of
robins Presently the birds ceased their singing and then the quiet
was more noticeable When night set in and the place seemed all the more
isolated and lonely for that Duane had a sense of relief

It dawned upon him all at once that he was nervous watchful sleepless
The fact caused him surprise and he began to think back to take note
of his late actions and their motives The change one day had wrought
amazed him He who had always been free easy happy especially when
out alone in the open had become in a few short hours bound serious
preoccupied The silence that had once been sweet now meant nothing
to him except a medium whereby he might the better hear the sounds
of pursuit The loneliness the night the wild that had always been
beautiful to him now only conveyed a sense of safety for the present
He watched he listened he thought He felt tired yet had no
inclination to rest He intended to be off by dawn heading toward the
southwest Had he a destination It was vague as his knowledge of that
great waste of mesquite and rock bordering the Rio Grande Somewhere out
there was a refuge For he was a fugitive from justice an outlaw

This being an outlaw then meant eternal vigilance No home no rest no
sleep no content no life worth the living He must be a lone wolf
or he must herd among men obnoxious to him If he worked for an honest
living he still must hide his identity and take risks of detection If
he did not work on some distant outlying ranch how was he to live The
idea of stealing was repugnant to him The future seemed gray and somber
enough And he was twentythree years old

Why had this hard life been imposed upon him

The bitter question seemed to start a strange iciness that stole
along his veins What was wrong with him He stirred the few sticks of
mesquite into a last flickering blaze He was cold and for some reason
he wanted some light The black circle of darkness weighed down upon
him closed in around him Suddenly he sat bolt upright and then froze
in that position He had heard a step It was behind himnoon the
side Some one was there He forced his hand down to his gun and the
touch of cold steel was another icy shock Then he waited But all
was silentsilent as only a wilderness arroyo can be with its low
murmuring of wind in the mesquite Had he heard a step He began to
breathe again

But what was the matter with the light of his campfire It had taken
on a strange green luster and seemed to be waving off into the outer
shadows Duane heard no step saw no movement nevertheless there was
another present at that campfire vigil Duane saw him He lay there in
the middle of the green brightness prostrate motionless dying Cal
Bain His features were wonderfully distinct clearer than any cameo
more sharply outlined than those of any picture It was a hard face
softening at the threshold of eternity The red tan of sun the coarse
signs of drunkenness the ferocity and hate so characteristic of Bain
were no longer there This face represented a different Bain showed all
that was human in him fading fading as swiftly as it blanched white
The lips wanted to speak but had not the power The eyes held an agony
of thought They revealed what might have been possible for this man
if he livedthat he saw his mistake too late Then they rolled set
blankly and closed in death

That haunting visitation left Duane sitting there in a cold sweat a
remorse gnawing at his vitals realizing the curse that was on him
He divined that never would he be able to keep off that phantom He
remembered how his father had been eternally pursued by the furies of
accusing guilt how he had never been able to forget in work or in sleep
those men he had killed

The hour was late when Duanes mind let him sleep and then dreams
troubled him In the morning he bestirred himself so early that in the
gray gloom he had difficulty in finding his horse Day had just broken
when he struck the old trail again

He rode hard all morning and halted in a shady spot to rest and graze
his horse In the afternoon he took to the trail at an easy trot The
country grew wilder Bald rugged mountains broke the level of the
monotonous horizon About three in the afternoon he came to a little
river which marked the boundary line of his hunting territory

The decision he made to travel upstream for a while was owing to two
facts the river was high with quicksand bars on each side and he felt
reluctant to cross into that region where his presence alone meant that
he was a marked man The bottomlands through which the river wound to
the southwest were more inviting than the barrens he had traversed The
rest or that day he rode leisurely upstream At sunset he penetrated
the brakes of willow and cottonwood to spend the night It seemed to
him that in this lonely cover he would feel easy and content But he
did not Every feeling every imagining he had experienced the previous
night returned somewhat more vividly and accentuated by newer ones of
the same intensity and color

In this kind of travel and camping he spent three more days during
which he crossed a number of trails and one road where cattlestolen
cattle probablyhad recently passed Thus time exhausted his supply
of food except salt pepper coffee and sugar of which he had a
quantity There were deer in the brakes but as he could not get close
enough to kill them with a revolver he had to satisfy himself with a
rabbit He knew he might as well content himself with the hard fare that
assuredly would be his lot

Somewhere up this river there was a village called Huntsville It
was distant about a hundred miles from Wellston and had a reputation
throughout southwestern Texas He had never been there The fact was
this reputation was such that honest travelers gave the town a wide
berth Duane had considerable money for him in his possession and he
concluded to visit Huntsville if he could find it and buy a stock of
provisions

The following day toward evening he happened upon a road which
he believed might lead to the village There were a good many fresh
horsetracks in the sand and these made him thoughtful Nevertheless
he followed the road proceeding cautiously He had not gone very far
when the sound of rapid hoofbeats caught his ears They came from his
rear In the darkening twilight he could not see any great distance back
along the road Voices however warned him that these riders whoever
they were had approached closer than he liked To go farther down the
road was not to be thought of so he turned a little way in among the
mesquites and halted hoping to escape being seen or heard As he was
now a fugitive it seemed every man was his enemy and pursuer

The horsemen were fast approaching Presently they were abreast of
Duanes position so near that he could hear the creak of saddles the
clink of spurs

Shore he crossed the river below said one man

I reckon youre right Bill Hes slipped us replied another

Rangers or a posse of ranchers in pursuit of a fugitive The knowledge
gave Duane a strange thrill Certainly they could not have been hunting
him But the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what
it would have been had he been this particular hunted man He held
his breath he clenched his teeth he pressed a quieting hand upon his
horse Suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted They
were whispering He could just make out a dark group closely massed
What had made them halt so suspiciously

Youre wrong Bill said a man in a low but distinct voice

The idee of hearin a hoss heave Youre wussn a ranger And youre
hellbent on killin that rustler Now I say lets go home and eat

Wal Ill just take a look at the sand replied the man called Bill

Duane heard the clink of spurs on steel stirrup and the thud of boots on
the ground There followed a short silence which was broken by a sharply
breathed exclamation

Duane waited for no more They had found his trail He spurred his horse
straight into the brush At the second crashing bound there came yells
from the road and then shots Duane heard the hiss of a bullet close
by his ear and as it struck a branch it made a peculiar singing sound
These shots and the proximity of that lead missile roused in Duane a
quick hot resentment which mounted into a passion almost ungovernable
He must escape yet it seemed that he did not care whether he did or
not Something grim kept urging him to halt and return the fire of these
men After running a couple of hundred yards he raised himself from over
the pommel where he had bent to avoid the stinging branches and tried
to guide his horse In the dark shadows under mesquites and cottonwoods
he was hard put to it to find open passage however he succeeded so
well and made such little noise that gradually he drew away from his
pursuers The sound of their horses crashing through the thickets died
away Duane reined in and listened He had distanced them Probably they
would go into camp till daylight then follow his tracks He started on
again walking his horse and peered sharply at the ground so that he
might take advantage of the first trail he crossed It seemed a long
while until he came upon one He followed it until a late hour when
striking the willow brakes again and hence the neighborhood of the
river he picketed his horse and lay down to rest But he did not sleep
His mind bitterly revolved the fate that had come upon him He made
efforts to think of other things but in vain

Every moment he expected the chill the sense of loneliness that yet
was ominous of a strange visitation the peculiarly imagined lights and
shades of the nightthese things that presaged the coming of Cal Bain
Doggedly Duane fought against the insidious phantom He kept telling
himself that it was just imagination that it would wear off in time
Still in his heart he did not believe what he hoped But he would not
give up he would not accept the ghost of his victim as a reality

Gray dawn found him in the saddle again headed for the river Half an
hour of riding brought him to the dense chaparral and willow thickets
These he threaded to come at length to the ford It was a gravel bottom
and therefore an easy crossing Once upon the opposite shore he
reined in his horse and looked darkly back This action marked his
acknowledgment of his situation he had voluntarily sought the refuge
of the outlaws he was beyond the pale A bitter and passionate curse
passed his lips as he spurred his horse into the brakes on that alien
shore

He rode perhaps twenty miles not sparing his horse nor caring whether
or not he left a plain trail

Let them hunt me he muttered

When the heat of the day began to be oppressive and hunger and thirst
made themselves manifest Duane began to look about him for a place to
halt for the noonhours The trail led into a road which was hard packed
and smooth from the tracks of cattle He doubted not that he had come
across one of the roads used by border raiders He headed into it and
had scarcely traveled a mile when turning a curve he came pointblank
upon a single horseman riding toward him Both riders wheeled their
mounts sharply and were ready to run and shoot back Not more than a
hundred paces separated them They stood then for a moment watching each
other

Mawnin stranger called the man dropping his hand from his hip

Howdy replied Duane shortly

They rode toward each other closing half the gap then they halted
again

I seen you aint no ranger called the rider an shore I aint
none

He laughed loudly as if he had made a joke

Howd you know I wasnt a ranger asked Duane curiously Somehow
he had instantly divined that his horseman was no officer or even a
rancher trailing stolen stock

Wal said the fellow starting his horse forward at a walk a
rangerd never git ready to run the other way from one man

He laughed again He was small and wiry slouchy of attire and armed to
the teeth and he bestrode a fine bay horse He had quick dancing brown
eyes at once frank and bold and a coarse bronzed face Evidently he
was a goodnatured ruffian

Duane acknowledged the truth of the assertion and turned over in his
mind how shrewdly the fellow had guessed him to be a hunted man

My names Luke Stevens an I hail from the river Whore you said
this stranger

Duane was silent

I reckon youre Buck Duane went on Stevens I heerd you was a damn
bad man with a gun

This time Duane laughed not at the doubtful compliment but at the
idea that the first outlaw he met should know him Here was proof of how
swiftly facts about gunplay traveled on the Texas border

Wal Buck said Stevens in a friendly manner I aint presumin on
your time or company I see youre headin fer the river But will you
stop long enough to stake a feller to a bite of grub

Im out of grub and pretty hungry myself admitted Duane

Been pushin your hoss I see Wal I reckon youd better stock up
before you hit thet stretch of country

He made a wide sweep of his right arm indicating the southwest and
there was that in his action which seemed significant of a vast and
barren region

Stock up queried Duane thoughtfully

Shore A feller has jest got to eat I can rustle along without whisky
but not without grub Thets what makes it so embarrassin travelin
these parts dodgin your shadow Now Im on my way to Mercer Its
a little twobit town up the river a ways Im goin to pack out some
grub

Stevenss tone was inviting Evidently he would welcome Duanes
companionship but he did not openly say so Duane kept silence
however and then Stevens went on

Stranger in this here country twos a crowd Its safer I never was
much on this lonewolf dodgin though Ive done it of necessity It
takes a damn good man to travel alone any length of time Why Ive been
thet sick I was jest achin fer some ranger to come along an plug me
Give me a pardner any day Now mebbe youre not thet kind of a
feller an Im shore not presumin to ask But I just declares myself
sufficient

You mean youd like me to go with you asked Duane

Stevens grinned Wal I should smile Id be particular proud to be
braced with a man of your reputation

See here my good fellow thats all nonsense declared Duane in some
haste

Shore I think modesty becomin to a youngster replied Stevens I
hate a brag An Ive no use fer these fourflush cowboys thet re
always lookin fer trouble an talkin gunplay Buck I dont know much
about you But every man whos lived along the Texas border remembers a
lot about your Dad It was expected of you I reckon an much of your
rep was established before you thronged your gun I jest heerd thet you
was lightnin on the draw an when you cut loose with a gun why the
figger on the ace of spades would cover your cluster of bulletholes
Thets the word thets gone down the border Its the kind of reputation
most sure to fly far an swift ahead of a man in this country An the
safest too Ill gamble on thet Its the land of the draw I see now
youre only a boy though youre shore a strappin husky one Now
Buck Im not a spring chicken an Ive been long on the dodge Mebbe
a little of my society wont hurt you none Youll need to learn the
country

There was something sincere and likable about this outlaw

I dare say youre right replied Duane quietly And Ill go to
Mercer with you

Next moment he was riding down the road with Stevens Duane had never
been much of a talker and now he found speech difficult But his
companion did not seem to mind that He was a jocose voluble fellow
probably glad now to hear the sound of his own voice Duane listened
and sometimes he thought with a pang of the distinction of name and
heritage of blood his father had left to him



CHAPTER III

Late that day a couple of hours before sunset Duane and Stevens
having rested their horses in the shade of some mesquites near the town
of Mercer saddled up and prepared to move

Buck as were lookin fer grub an not trouble I reckon youd better
hang up out here Stevens was saying as he mounted You see towns
an sheriffs an rangers are always lookin fer new fellers gone bad
They sort of forget most of the old boys except those as are plumb
bad Now nobody in Mercer will take notice of me Reckon theres been
a thousand men run into the river country to become outlaws since yours
truly You jest wait here an be ready to ride hard Mebbe my besettin
sin will go operatin in spite of my good intentions In which case
therell be

His pause was significant He grinned and his brown eyes danced with a
kind of wild humor

Stevens have you got any money asked Duane

Money exclaimed Luke blankly Say I havent owned a twobit piece
sincewal fer some time

Ill furnish money for grub returned Duane And for whisky too
providing you hurry back herewithout making trouble

Shore youre a downright good pard declared Stevens in admiration
as he took the money I give my word Buck an Im here to say I never
broke it yet Lay low an look fer me back quick

With that he spurred his horse and rode out of the mesquites toward the
town At that distance about a quarter of a mile Mercer appeared to be
a cluster of low adobe houses set in a grove of cottonwoods Pastures
of alfalfa were dotted by horses and cattle Duane saw a sheepherder
driving in a meager flock

Presently Stevens rode out of sight into the town Duane waited hoping
the outlaw would make good his word Probably not a quarter of an hour
had elapsed when Duane heard the clear reports of a Winchester rifle
the clatter of rapid hoofbeats and yells unmistakably the kind to mean
danger for a man like Stevens Duane mounted and rode to the edge of the
mesquites

He saw a cloud of dust down the road and a bay horse running fast
Stevens apparently had not been wounded by any of the shots for he had
a steady seat in his saddle and his riding even at that moment struck
Duane as admirable He carried a large pack over the pommel and he kept
looking back The shots had ceased but the yells increased Duane saw
several men running and waving their arms Then he spurred his horse and
got into a swift stride so Stevens would not pass him Presently the
outlaw caught up with him Stevens was grinning but there was now no
fun in the dancing eyes It was a devil that danced in them His face
seemed a shade paler

Was jest comin out of the store yelled Stevens Run plumb into a
rancherwho knowed me He opened up with a rifle Think theyll chase
us

They covered several miles before there were any signs of pursuit and
when horsemen did move into sight out of the cottonwoods Duane and his
companion steadily drew farther away

No hosses in thet bunch to worry us called out Stevens

Duane had the same conviction and he did not look back again He rode
somewhat to the fore and was constantly aware of the rapid thudding of
hoofs behind as Stevens kept close to him At sunset they reached the
willow brakes and the river Duanes horse was winded and lashed with
sweat and lather It was not until the crossing had been accomplished
that Duane halted to rest his animal Stevens was riding up the low
sandy bank He reeled in the saddle With an exclamation of surprise
Duane leaped off and ran to the outlaws side

Stevens was pale and his face bore beads of sweat The whole front of
his shirt was soaked with blood

Youre shot cried Duane

Wal who n hell said I wasnt Would you mind givin me a lifton
this here pack

Duane lifted the heavy pack down and then helped Stevens to dismount
The outlaw had a bloody foam on his lips and he was spitting blood

Oh why didnt you say so cried Duane I never thought You seemed
all right

Wal Luke Stevens may be as gabby as an old woman but sometimes he
doesnt say anythin It wouldnt have done no good

Duane bade him sit down removed his shirt and washed the blood from
his breast and back Stevens had been shot in the breast fairly low
down and the bullet had gone clear through him His ride holding
himself and that heavy pack in the saddle had been a feat little short
of marvelous Duane did not see how it had been possible and he felt no
hope for the outlaw But he plugged the wounds and bound them tightly

Fellers name was Brown Stevens said Me an him fell out over a
hoss I stole from him over in Huntsville We had a shootinscrape then
Wal as I was straddlin my hoss back there in Mercer I seen this Brown
an seen him before he seen me Could have killed him too But I wasnt
breakin my word to you I kind of hoped he wouldnt spot me But he
didan fust shot he got me here What do you think of this hole

Its pretty bad replied Duane and he could not look the cheerful
outlaw in the eyes

I reckon it is Wal Ive had some bad wounds I lived over Guess mebbe
I can stand this one Now Buck get me some place in the brakes leave
me some grub an water at my hand an then you clear out

Leave you here alone asked Duane sharply

Shore You see I cant keep up with you Brown an his friends will
foller us across the river a ways Youve got to think of number one in
this game

What would you do in my case asked Duane curiously

Wal I reckon Id clear out an save my hide replied Stevens

Duane felt inclined to doubt the outlaws assertion For his own part he
decided his conduct without further speech First he watered the horses
filled canteens and water bag and then tied the pack upon his own
horse That done he lifted Stevens upon his horse and holding him in
the saddle turned into the brakes being careful to pick out hard or
grassy ground that left little signs of tracks Just about dark he ran
across a trail that Stevens said was a good one to take into the wild
country

Reckon wed better keep right on in the darktill I drop concluded
Stevens with a laugh

All that night Duane gloomy and thoughtful attentive to the wounded
outlaw walked the trail and never halted till daybreak He was tired
then and very hungry Stevens seemed in bad shape although he was still
spirited and cheerful Duane made camp The outlaw refused food but
asked for both whisky and water Then he stretched out

Buck will you take off my boots he asked with a faint smile on his
pallid face

Duane removed them wondering if the outlaw had the thought that he did
not want to die with his boots on Stevens seemed to read his mind

Buck my old daddy used to say thet I was born to be hanged But I
wasntan dyin with your boots on is the next wust way to croak

Youve a chance toto get over this said Duane

Shore But I want to be correct about the bootsan say pard if I do
go over jest you remember thet I was appreciatin of your kindness

Then he closed his eyes and seemed to sleep

Duane could not find water for the horses but there was an abundance
of dewwet grass upon which he hobbled them After that was done he
prepared himself a muchneeded meal The sun was getting warm when he
lay down to sleep and when he awoke it was sinking in the west Stevens
was still alive for he breathed heavily The horses were in sight All
was quiet except the hum of insects in the brush Duane listened awhile
then rose and went for the horses

When he returned with them he found Stevens awake brighteyed cheerful
as usual and apparently stronger

Wal Buck Im still with you an good fer another nights ride he
said Guess about all I need now is a big pull on thet bottle Help
me will you There thet was bully I aint swallowin my blood this
evenin Mebbe Ive bled all there was in me

While Duane got a hurried meal for himself packed up the little outfit
and saddled the horses Stevens kept on talking He seemed to be in a
hurry to tell Duane all about the country Another night ride would put
them beyond fear of pursuit within striking distance of the Rio Grande
and the hidingplaces of the outlaws

When it came time for mounting the horses Stevens said Reckon you
can pull on my boots once more In spite of the laugh accompanying the
words Duane detected a subtle change in the outlaws spirit

On this night travel was facilitated by the fact that the trail was
broad enough for two horses abreast enabling Duane to ride while
upholding Stevens in the saddle

The difficulty most persistent was in keeping the horses in a walk They
were used to a trot and that kind of gait would not do for Stevens
The red died out of the west a pale afterglow prevailed for a while
darkness set in then the broad expanse of blue darkened and the stars
brightened After a while Stevens ceased talking and drooped in his
saddle Duane kept the horses going however and the slow hours wore
away Duane thought the quiet night would never break to dawn that
there was no end to the melancholy brooding plain But at length a
grayness blotted out the stars and mantled the level of mesquite and
cactus

Dawn caught the fugitives at a green campingsite on the bank of a rocky
little stream Stevens fell a dead weight into Duanes arms and one
look at the haggard face showed Duane that the outlaw had taken his last
ride He knew it too Yet that cheerfulness prevailed

Buck my feet are orful tired packin them heavy boots he said and
seemed immensely relieved when Duane had removed them

This matter of the outlaws boots was strange Duane thought He made
Stevens as comfortable as possible then attended to his own needs And
the outlaw took up the thread of his conversation where he had left off
the night before

This trail splits up a ways from here an every branch of it leads
to a hole where youll find mena few mebbe like yourselfsome like
mean gangs of nogood hossthieves rustlers an such Its easy
livin Buck I reckon though that youll not find it easy Youll
never mix in Youll be a lone wolf I seen that right off Wal if
a man can stand the loneliness an if hes quick on the draw mebbe
lonewolfin it is the best Shore I dont know But these fellers in
here will be suspicious of a man who goes it alone If they get a chance
theyll kill you

Stevens asked for water several times He had forgotten or he did not
want the whisky His voice grew perceptibly weaker

Be quiet said Duane Talking uses up your strength

Aw Ill talk tillIm done he replied doggedly See here pard
you can gamble on what Im tellin you An itll be useful From this
camp wellyoull meet men right along An none of them will be honest
men All the same some are bettern others Ive lived along the river
fer twelve years Theres three big gangs of outlaws King Fisheryou
know him I reckon fer hes half the time livin among respectable
folks King is a pretty good feller Itll do to tie up with him ant his
gang Now theres Cheseldine who hangs out in the Rim Rock way up
the river Hes an outlaw chief I never seen him though I stayed once
right in his camp Late years hes got rich an keeps back pretty well
hid But BlandI knowed Bland fer years An I havent any use fer him
Bland has the biggest gang You aint likely to miss strikin his place
sometime or other Hes got a regular town I might say Shore theres
some gamblin an gunfightin goin on at Blands camp all the time
Bland has killed some twenty men an thets not countin greasers

Here Stevens took another drink and then rested for a while

You aint likely to get on with Bland he resumed presently Youre
too strappin big an goodlookin to please the chief Fer hes got
women in his camp Then hed be jealous of your possibilities with a
gun Shore I reckon hed be careful though Blands no fool an he
loves his hide I reckon any of the other gangs would be better fer you
when you aint goin it alone

Apparently that exhausted the fund of information and advice Stevens had
been eager to impart He lapsed into silence and lay with closed eyes
Meanwhile the sun rose warm the breeze waved the mesquites the birds
came down to splash in the shallow stream Duane dozed in a comfortable
seat By and by something roused him Stevens was once more talking but
with a changed tone

Fellers namewas Brown he rambled We fell outover a hoss I
stole from himin Huntsville He stole it fuss Browns one of them
sneaksafraid of the openhe steals an pretends to be honest Say
Buck mebbe youll meet Brown some dayYou an me are pards now

Ill remember if I ever meet him said Duane

That seemed to satisfy the outlaw Presently he tried to lift his
head but had not the strength A strange shade was creeping across the
bronzed rough face

My feet are pretty heavy Shore you got my boots off

Duane held them up but was not certain that Stevens could see them
The outlaw closed his eyes again and muttered incoherently Then he fell
asleep Duane believed that sleep was final The day passed with Duane
watching and waiting Toward sundown Stevens awoke and his eyes seemed
clearer Duane went to get some fresh water thinking his comrade would
surely want some When he returned Stevens made no sign that he wanted
anything There was something bright about him and suddenly Duane
realized what it meant

Pard youstuckto me the outlaw whispered

Duane caught a hint of gladness in the voice he traced a faint surprise
in the haggard face Stevens seemed like a little child

To Duane the moment was sad elemental big with a burden of mystery he
could not understand

Duane buried him in a shallow arroyo and heaped up a pile of stones
to mark the grave That done he saddled his comrades horse hung the
weapons over the pommel and mounting his own steed he rode down the
trail in the gathering twilight



CHAPTER IV

Two days later about the middle of the forenoon Duane dragged the
two horses up the last ascent of an exceedingly rough trail and found
himself on top of the Rim Rock with a beautiful green valley at his
feet the yellow sluggish Rio Grande shining in the sun and the great
wild mountainous barren of Mexico stretching to the south

Duane had not fallen in with any travelers He had taken the
likeliestlooking trail he had come across Where it had led him he had
not the slightest idea except that here was the river and probably the
inclosed valley was the retreat of some famous outlaw

No wonder outlaws were safe in that wild refuge Duane had spent the
last two days climbing the roughest and most difficult trail he had ever
seen From the looks of the descent he imagined the worst part of his
travel was yet to come Not improbably it was two thousand feet down to
the river The wedgeshaped valley green with alfalfa and cottonwood
and nestling down amid the bare walls of yellow rock was a delight and
a relief to his tired eyes Eager to get down to a level and to find a
place to rest Duane began the descent

The trail proved to be the kind that could not be descended slowly He
kept dodging rocks which his horses loosed behind him And in a short
time he reached the valley entering at the apex of the wedge A stream
of clear water tumbled out of the rocks here and most of it ran into
irrigationditches His horses drank thirstily And he drank with that
fullness and gratefulness common to the desert traveler finding sweet
water Then he mounted and rode down the valley wondering what would be
his reception

The valley was much larger than it had appeared from the high elevation
Well watered green with grass and tree and farmed evidently by good
hands it gave Duane a considerable surprise Horses and cattle were
everywhere Every clump of cottonwoods surrounded a small adobe house
Duane saw Mexicans working in the fields and horsemen going to and
fro Presently he passed a house bigger than the others with a porch
attached A woman young and pretty he thought watched him from a door
No one else appeared to notice him

Presently the trail widened into a road and that into a kind of square
lined by a number of adobe and log buildings of rudest structure
Within sight were horses dogs a couple of steers Mexican women with
children and white men all of whom appeared to be doing nothing His
advent created no interest until he rode up to the white men who were
lolling in the shade of a house This place evidently was a store and
saloon and from the inside came a lazy hum of voices

As Duane reined to a halt one of the loungers in the shade rose with a
loud exclamation

Bust me if thet aint Lukes hoss

The others accorded their interest if not assent by rising to advance
toward Duane

How about it Euchre Aint thet Lukes bay queried the first man

Plain as your nose replied the fellow called Euchre

There aint no doubt about thet then laughed another fer Bosomers
nose is shore plain on the landscape

These men lined up before Duane and as he coolly regarded them he
thought they could have been recognized anywhere as desperadoes The
man called Bosomer who had stepped forward had a forbidding face which
showed yellow eyes an enormous nose and a skin the color of dust with
a thatch of sandy hair

Stranger who are you an where in the hell did you git thet bay hoss
he demanded His yellow eyes took in Stevenss horse then the weapons
hung on the saddle and finally turned their glinting hard light upward
to Duane

Duane did not like the tone in which he had been addressed and he
remained silent At least half his mind seemed busy with curious
interest in regard to something that leaped inside him and made his
breast feel tight He recognized it as that strange emotion which had
shot through him often of late and which had decided him to go out to
the meeting with Bain Only now it was different more powerful

Stranger who are you asked another man somewhat more civilly

My names Duane replied Duane curtly

An howd you come by the hoss

Duane answered briefly and his words were followed by a short silence
during which the men looked at him Bosomer began to twist the ends of
his beard

Reckon hes dead all right or nobodyd hev his hoss an guns
presently said Euchre

Mister Duane began Bosomer in low stinging tones I happen to be
Luke Stevenss sidepardner

Duane looked him over from dusty wornout boots to his slouchy
sombrero That look seemed to inflame Bosomer

An I want the hoss an them guns he shouted

You or anybody else can have them for all I care I just fetched them
in But the pack is mine replied Duane And say I befriended your
pard If you cant use a civil tongue youd better cinch it

Civil Haw haw rejoined the outlaw I dont know you How do we
know you didnt plug Stevens an stole his hoss an jest happened to
stumble down here

Youll have to take my word thats all replied Duane sharply

I aint takin your word Savvy thet An I was Lukes pard

With that Bosomer wheeled and pushing his companions aside he stamped
into the saloon where his voice broke out in a roar

Duane dismounted and threw his bridle

Stranger Bosomer is shore hotheaded said the man Euchre He did not
appear unfriendly nor were the others hostile

At this juncture several more outlaws crowded out of the door and
the one in the lead was a tall man of stalwart physique His manner
proclaimed him a leader He had a long face a flaming red beard and
clear cold blue eyes that fixed in close scrutiny upon Duane He was
not a Texan in truth Duane did not recognize one of these outlaws as
native to his state

Im Bland said the tall man authoritatively Whore you and whatre
you doing here

Duane looked at Bland as he had at the others This outlaw chief
appeared to be reasonable if he was not courteous Duane told his story
again this time a little more in detail

I believe you replied Bland at once Think I know when a fellow is
lying

I reckon youre on the right trail put in Euchre Thet about Luke
wantin his boots took offthet satisfies me Luke hed a mortal dread
of dyin with his boots on

At this sally the chief and his men laughed

You said DuaneBuck Duane queried Bland Are you a son of that
Duane who was a gunfighter some years back

Yes replied Duane

Never met him and glad I didnt said Bland with a grim humor So
you got in trouble and had to go on the dodge What kind of trouble

Had a fight

Fight Do you mean gunplay questioned Bland He seemed eager
curious speculative

Yes It ended in gunplay Im sorry to say answered Duane

Guess I neednt ask the son of Duane if he killed his man went on
Bland ironically Well Im sorry you bucked against trouble in my
camp But as it is I guess youd be wise to make yourself scarce

Do you mean Im politely told to move on asked Duane quietly

Not exactly that said Bland as if irritated If this isnt a free
place there isnt one on earth Every man is equal here Do you want to
join my band

No I dont

Well even if you did I imagine that wouldnt stop Bosomer Hes an
ugly fellow Hes one of the few gunmen Ive met who wants to kill
somebody all the time Most men like that are fourflushes But Bosomer
is all one color and thats red Merely for your own sake I advise you
to hit the trail

Thanks But if thats all Ill stay returned Duane Even as he spoke
he felt that he did not know himself

Bosomer appeared at the door pushing men who tried to detain him and
as he jumped clear of a last reaching hand he uttered a snarl like an
angry dog Manifestly the short while he had spent inside the saloon had
been devoted to drinking and talking himself into a frenzy Bland and
the other outlaws quickly moved aside letting Duane stand alone When
Bosomer saw Duane standing motionless and watchful a strange change
passed quickly in him He halted in his tracks and as he did that the
men who had followed him out piled over one another in their hurry to
get to one side

Duane saw all the swift action felt intuitively the meaning of it and
in Bosomers sudden change of front The outlaw was keen and he had
expected a shrinking or at least a frightened antagonist Duane knew he
was neither He felt like iron and yet thrill after thrill ran through
him It was almost as if this situation had been one long familiar to
him Somehow he understood this yelloweyed Bosomer The outlaw had
come out to kill him And now though somewhat checked by the stand of
a stranger he still meant to kill Like so many desperadoes of his
ilk he was victim of a passion to kill for the sake of killing Duane
divined that no sudden animosity was driving Bosomer It was just his
chance In that moment murder would have been joy to him Very likely
he had forgotten his pretext for a quarrel Very probably his faculties
were absorbed in conjecture as to Duanes possibilities

But he did not speak a word He remained motionless for a long moment
his eyes pale and steady his right hand like a claw

That instant gave Duane a power to read in his enemys eyes the thought
that preceded action But Duane did not want to kill another man
Still he would have to fight and he decided to cripple Bosomer When
Bosomers hand moved Duanes gun was spouting fire Two shots onlyboth
from Duanes gunand the outlaw fell with his right arm shattered
Bosomer cursed harshly and floundered in the dust trying to reach the
gun with his left hand His comrades however seeing that Duane would
not kill unless forced closed in upon Bosomer and prevented any further
madness on his part



CHAPTER V

Of the outlaws present Euchre appeared to be the one most inclined to
lend friendliness to curiosity and he led Duane and the horses away
to a small adobe shack He tied the horses in an open shed and removed
their saddles Then gathering up Stevenss weapons he invited his
visitor to enter the house

It had two roomswindows without coveringsbare floors One room
contained blankets weapons saddles and bridles the other a stone
fireplace rude table and bench two bunks a box cupboard and various
blackened utensils

Make yourself to home as long as you want to stay said Euchre I
aint rich in this worlds goods but I own whats here an youre
welcome

Thanks Ill stay awhile and rest Im pretty well played out replied
Duane

Euchre gave him a keen glance

Go ahead an rest Ill take your horses to grass Euchre left Duane
alone in the house Duane relaxed then and mechanically he wiped the
sweat from his face He was laboring under some kind of a spell or shock
which did not pass off quickly When it had worn away he took off his
coat and belt and made himself comfortable on the blankets And he had a
thought that if he rested or slept what difference would it make on the
morrow No rest no sleep could change the gray outlook of the future
He felt glad when Euchre came bustling in and for the first time he
took notice of the outlaw

Euchre was old in years What little hair he had was gray his face
cleanshaven and full of wrinkles his eyes were half shut from long
gazing through the sun and dust He stooped But his thin frame denoted
strength and endurance still unimpaired

Hey a drink or a smoke he asked

Duane shook his head He had not been unfamiliar with whisky and he
had used tobacco moderately since he was sixteen But now strangely he
felt a disgust at the idea of stimulants He did not understand clearly
what he felt There was that vague idea of something wild in his blood
something that made him fear himself

Euchre wagged his old head sympathetically Reckon you feel a little
sick When it comes to shootin I run Whats your age

Im twentythree replied Duane

Euchre showed surprise Youre only a boy I thought you thirty
anyways Buck I heard what you told Bland an puttin thet with my
own figgerin I reckon youre no criminal yet Throwin a gun in
selfdefensethet aint no crime

Duane finding relief in talking told more about himself

Huh replied the old man Ive been on this river fer years an Ive
seen hundreds of boys come in on the dodge Most of them though was no
good An thet kind dont last long This river country has been an is
the refuge fer criminals from all over the states Ive bunked with
bank cashiers forgers plain thieves an outanout murderers all
of which had no bizness on the Texas border Fellers like Bland are
exceptions Hes no Texanyou seen thet The gang he rules here come
from all over an theyre tough cusses you can bet on thet They live
fat an easy If it wasnt fer the fightin among themselves theyd
shore grow populous The Rim Rock is no place for a peaceable decent
feller I heard you tell Bland you wouldnt join his gang Thetll not
make him take a likin to you Have you any money

Not much replied Duane

Could you live by gamblin Are you any good at cards

No

You wouldnt steal hosses or rustle cattle

No

When your moneys gone hown hell will you live There aint any work
a decent feller could do You cant herd with greasers Why Blands men
would shoot at you in the fields Whatll you do son

God knows replied Duane hopelessly Ill make my money last as long
as possiblethen starve

Wal Im pretty pore but youll never starve while I got anythin

Here it struck Duane againthat something human and kind and eager
which he had seen in Stevens Duanes estimate of outlaws had lacked
this quality He had not accorded them any virtues To him as to the
outside world they had been merely vicious men without one redeeming
feature

Im much obliged to you Euchre replied Duane But of course I wont
live with any one unless I can pay my share

Have it any way you like my son said Euchre goodhumoredly You
make a fire an Ill set about gettin grub Im a sourdough Buck
Thet man doesnt live who can beat my bread

How do you ever pack supplies in here asked Duane thinking of the
almost inaccessible nature of the valley

Some comes across from Mexico an the rest down the river Thet river
trip is a bird Its moren five hundred miles to any supply point
Bland has mozos greaser boatmen Sometimes too he gets supplies in
from downriver You see Bland sells thousands of cattle in Cuba An
all this stock has to go down by boat to meet the ships

Where on earth are the cattle driven down to the river asked Duane

Thets not my secret replied Euchre shortly Fact is I dont know
Ive rustled cattle for Bland but he never sent me through the Rim Rock
with them

Duane experienced a sort of pleasure in the realization that interest
had been stirred in him He was curious about Bland and his gang and
glad to have something to think about For every once in a while he had
a sensation that was almost like a pang He wanted to forget In the
next hour he did forget and enjoyed helping in the preparation and
eating of the meal Euchre after washing and hanging up the several
utensils put on his hat and turned to go out

Come along or stay here as you want he said to Duane

Ill stay rejoined Duane slowly

The old outlaw left the room and trudged away whistling cheerfully

Duane looked around him for a book or paper anything to read but
all the printed matter he could find consisted of a few words on
cartridgeboxes and an advertisement on the back of a tobaccopouch
There seemed to be nothing for him to do He had rested he did not want
to lie down any more He began to walk to and fro from one end of the
room to the other And as he walked he fell into the lately acquired
habit of brooding over his misfortune

Suddenly he straightened up with a jerk Unconsciously he had drawn his
gun Standing there with the bright cold weapon in his hand he looked
at it in consternation How had he come to draw it With difficulty
he traced his thoughts backward but could not find any that was
accountable for his act He discovered however that he had a
remarkable tendency to drop his hand to his gun That might have come
from the habit long practice in drawing had given him Likewise it
might have come from a subtle sense scarcely thought of at all of the
late close and inevitable relation between that weapon and himself He
was amazed to find that bitter as he had grown at fate the desire to
live burned strong in him If he had been as unfortunately situated but
with the difference that no man wanted to put him in jail or take his
life he felt that this burning passion to be free to save himself
might not have been so powerful Life certainly held no bright prospects
for him Already he had begun to despair of ever getting back to his
home But to give up like a whitehearted coward to let himself be
handcuffed and jailed to run from a drunken bragging cowboy or be
shot in cold blood by some border brute who merely wanted to add another
notch to his gunthese things were impossible for Duane because there
was in him the temper to fight In that hour he yielded only to fate and
the spirit inborn in him Hereafter this gun must be a living part
of him Right then and there he returned to a practice he had long
discontinuedthe draw It was now a stern bitter deadly business with
him He did not need to fire the gun for accuracy was a gift and had
become assured Swiftness on the draw however could be improved and
he set himself to acquire the limit of speed possible to any man He
stood still in his tracks he paced the room he sat down lay down
put himself in awkward positions and from every position he practiced
throwing his gunpracticed it till he was hot and tired and his arm
ached and his hand burned That practice he determined to keep up every
day It was one thing at least that would help pass the weary hours

Later he went outdoors to the cooler shade of the cottonwoods From
this point he could see a good deal of the valley Under different
circumstances Duane felt that he would have enjoyed such a beautiful
spot Euchres shack sat against the first rise of the slope of the
wall and Duane by climbing a few rods got a view of the whole valley
Assuredly it was an outlaw settle meet He saw a good many Mexicans
who of course were hand and glove with Bland Also he saw enormous
flatboats crude of structure moored along the banks of the river The
Rio Grande rolled away between high bluffs A cable sagging deep in
the middle was stretched over the wide yellow stream and an old scow
evidently used as a ferry lay anchored on the far shore

The valley was an ideal retreat for an outlaw band operating on a big
scale Pursuit scarcely need be feared over the broken trails of the Rim
Rock And the open end of the valley could be defended against almost
any number of men coming down the river Access to Mexico was easy and
quick What puzzled Duane was how Bland got cattle down to the river
and he wondered if the rustler really did get rid of his stolen stock by
use of boats

Duane must have idled considerable time up on the hill for when he
returned to the shack Euchre was busily engaged around the campfire

Wal glad to see you aint so pale about the gills as you was he
said by way of greeting Pitch in an well soon have grub ready
Theres shore one consolin fact round this here camp

Whats that asked Duane

Plenty of good juicy beef to eat An it doesnt cost a short bit

But it costs hard rides and trouble bad conscience and life too
doesnt it

I aint shore about the bad conscience Mine never bothered me none
An as for life why thets cheap in Texas

Who is Bland asked Duane quickly changing the subject What do you
know about him

We dont know who he is or where he hails from replied Euchre
Thets always been somethin to interest the gang He must have been
a young man when he struck Texas Now hes middleaged I remember how
years ago he was softspoken an not rough in talk or act like he is
now Bland aint likely his right name He knows a lot He can doctor
you an hes shore a knowin feller with tools Hes the kind thet
rules men Outlaws are always ridin in here to join his gang an if
it hadnt been fer the gamblin an gunplay hed have a thousand men
around him

How many in his gang now

I reckon theres short of a hundred now The number varies Then Bland
has several small camps up an down the river Also he has men back on
the cattleranges

How does he control such a big force asked Duane Especially when
his bands composed of bad men Luke Stevens said he had no use for
Bland And I heard once somewhere that Bland was a devil

Thets it He is a devil Hes as hard as flint violent in temper
never made any friends except his righthand men Dave Rugg an Chess
Alloway Blandll shoot at a wink Hes killed a lot of fellers an
some fer nothin The reason thet outlaws gather round him an stick is
because hes a safe refuge an then hes well heeled Bland is rich
They say he has a hundred thousand pesos hid somewhere an lots of
gold But hes free with money He gambles when hes not off with a
shipment of cattle He throws money around An the fact is theres
always plenty of money where he is Thets what holds the gang Dirty
bloody money

Its a wonder he hasnt been killed All these years on the border
exclaimed Duane

Wal replied Euchre dryly hes been quicker on the draw than the
other fellers who hankered to kill him thets all

Euchres reply rather chilled Duanes interest for the moment Such
remarks always made his mind revolve round facts pertaining to himself

Speakin of this here swift wrist game went on Euchre theres been
considerable talk in camp about your throwin of a gun You know Buck
thet among us fellersus hunted menthere aint anythin calculated
to rouse respect like a slick hand with a gun I heard Bland say this
afternoonan he said it seriouslike an speculativethet hed
never seen your equal He was watchin of you close he said an just
couldnt follow your hand when you drawed All the fellers who seen you
meet Bosomer had somethin to say Bo was about as handy with a gun as
any man in this camp barrin Chess Alloway an mebbe Bland himself
Chess is the captain with a Coltor he was An he shore didnt like
the references made about your speed Bland was honest in acknowledgin
it but he didnt like it neither Some of the fellers allowed your
draw might have been just accident But most of them figgered different
An they all shut up when Bland told who an what your Dad was Pears
to me I once seen your Dad in a gunscrape over at Santone years ago
Wal I put my oar in today among the fellers an I says What ails
you locoed gents Did young Duane budge an inch when Bo came roarin
out blood in his eye Wasnt he cool an quiet steady of lips an
werent his eyes readin Bos mind An thet lightnin drawcant
youall see thets a family gift

Euchres narrow eyes twinkled and he gave the dough he was rolling a
slap with his flourwhitened hand Manifestly he had proclaimed himself
a champion and partner of Duanes with all the pride an old man could
feel in a young one whom he admired

Wal he resumed presently thets your introduction to the border
Buck An your card was a high trump Youll be let severely alone by
real gunfighters an men like Bland Alloway Rugg an the bosses of
the other gangs After all these real men are men you know an onless
you cross them theyre no more likely to interfere with you than you
are with them But theres a sight of fellers like Bosomer in the river
country Theyll all want your game An every town you ride into will
scare up some cowpuncher full of booze or a longhaired fourflush
gunman or a sheriffan these men will be playin to the crowd an
yellin for your blood Thets the Texas of it Youll have to hide fer
ever in the brakes or youll have to KILL such men Buck I reckon this
aint cheerful news to a decent chap like you Im only tellin you
because Ive taken a likin to you an I seen right off thet you aint
borderwise Lets eat now an afterward well go out so the gang can
see youre not hidin

When Duane went out with Euchre the sun was setting behind a blue range
of mountains across the river in Mexico The valley appeared to open to
the southwest It was a tranquil beautiful scene Somewhere in a house
near at hand a woman was singing And in the road Duane saw a little
Mexican boy driving home some cows one of which wore a bell The
sweet happy voice of a woman and a whistling barefoot boythese seemed
utterly out of place here

Euchre presently led to the square and the row of rough houses Duane
remembered He almost stepped on a wide imprint in the dust where
Bosomer had confronted him And a sudden fury beset him that he should
be affected strangely by the sight of it

Lets have a look in here said Euchre

Duane had to bend his head to enter the door He found himself in a very
large room inclosed by adobe walls and roofed with brush It was full of
rude benches tables seats At one corner a number of kegs and barrels
lay side by side in a rack A Mexican boy was lighting lamps hung on
posts that sustained the log rafters of the roof

The only feller whos goin to put a close eye on you is Benson
said Euchre He runs the place an sells drinks The gang calls him
Jackrabbit Benson because hes always got his eye peeled an his ear
cocked Dont notice him if he looks you over Buck Benson is scared to
death of every newcomer who rustles into Blands camp An the reason
I take it is because hes done somebody dirt Hes hidin Not from
a sheriff or ranger Men who hide from them dont act like Jackrabbit
Benson Hes hidin from some guy whos huntin him to kill him Wal
Im always expectin to see some feller ride in here an throw a gun on
Benson Cant say Id be grieved

Duane casually glanced in the direction indicated and he saw a spare
gaunt man with a face strikingly white beside the red and bronze and
dark skins of the men around him It was a cadaverous face The black
mustache hung down a heavy lock of black hair dropped down over the
brow deepset hollow staring eyes looked out piercingly The man had
a restless alert nervous manner He put his hands on the board that
served as a bar and stared at Duane But when he met Duanes glance he
turned hurriedly to go on serving out liquor

What have you got against him inquired Duane as he sat down beside
Euchre He asked more for something to say than from real interest What
did he care about a mean haunted cravenfaced criminal

Wal mebbe Im crossgrained replied Euchre apologetically Shore
an outlaw an rustler such as me cant be touchy But I never stole
nothin but cattle from some rancher who never missed em anyway Thet
sneak Bensonhe was the means of puttin a little girl in Blands way

Girl queried Duane now with real attention

Shore Blands great on women Ill tell you about this girl when we
get out of here Some of the gang are goin to be sociable an I cant
talk about the chief

During the ensuing halfhour a number of outlaws passed by Duane and
Euchre halted for a greeting or sat down for a moment They were all
gruff loudvoiced merry and goodnatured Duane replied civilly
and agreeably when he was personally addressed but he refused all
invitations to drink and gamble Evidently he had been accepted in a
way as one of their clan No one made any hint of an allusion to his
affair with Bosomer Duane saw readily that Euchre was well liked One
outlaw borrowed money from him another asked for tobacco

By the time it was dark the big room was full of outlaws and Mexicans
most of whom were engaged at monte These gamblers especially the
Mexicans were intense and quiet The noise in the place came from the
drinkers the loungers Duane had seen gamblingresortssome of the
famous ones in San Antonio and El Paso a few in border towns where
license went unchecked But this place of Jackrabbit Bensons impressed
him as one where guns and knives were accessories to the game To his
perhaps rather distinguishing eye the most prominent thing about the
gamesters appeared to be their weapons On several of the tables were
piles of silverMexican pesosas large and high as the crown of his
hat There were also piles of gold and silver in United States coin
Duane needed no experienced eyes to see that betting was heavy and that
heavy sums exchanged hands The Mexicans showed a sterner obsession an
intenser passion Some of the Americans staked freely nonchalantly
as befitted men to whom money was nothing These latter were manifestly
winning for there were brother outlaws there who wagered coin with
grudging sullen greedy eyes Boisterous talk and laughter among the
drinking men drowned except at intervals the low brief talk of the
gamblers The clink of coin sounded incessantly sometimes just low
steady musical rings and again when a pile was tumbled quickly there
was a silvery crash Here an outlaw pounded on a table with the butt of
his gun there another noisily palmed a roll of dollars while he studied
his opponents face The noises however in Bensons den did not
contribute to any extent to the sinister aspect of the place That
seemed to come from the grim and reckless faces from the bent intent
heads from the dark lights and shades There were bright lights
but these served only to make the shadows And in the shadows lurked
unrestrained lust of gain a spirit ruthless and reckless a something
at once suggesting lawlessness theft murder and hell

Blands not here tonight Euchre was saying He left today on one of
his trips takin Alloway an some others But his other man Rugg hes
here See him standin with them three fellers all close to Benson
Ruggs the little bowlegged man with the half of his face shot off
Hes oneeyed But he can shore see out of the one hes got An darn
me theres Hardin You know him Hes got an outlaw gang as big as
Blands Hardin is standin next to Benson See how quiet an unassumin
he looks Yes thets Hardin He comes here once in a while to see
Bland Theyre friends whichs shore strange Do you see thet greaser
therethe one with gold an lace on his sombrero Thets Manuel a
Mexican bandit Hes a great gambler Comes here often to drop his coin
Next to him is Bill Marrthe feller with the bandana round his head
Bill rode in the other day with some fresh bulletholes Hes been shot
moren any feller I ever heard of Hes full of lead Funny because
Bills no troublehunter an like me hed rather run than shoot But
hes the best rustler Blands gota grand rider an a wonder with
cattle An see the towheaded youngster Thets Kid Fuller the kid of
Blands gang Fuller has hit the pace hard an he wont last the year
out on the border He killed his sweethearts father got run out of
Staceytown took to stealin hosses An next hes here with Bland
Another boy gone wrong an now shore a hard nut

Euchre went on calling Duanes attention to other men just as he
happened to glance over them Any one of them would have been a marked
man in a respectable crowd Here each took his place with more or less
distinction according to the record of his past wild prowess and his
present possibilities Duane realizing that he was tolerated there
received in careless friendly spirit by this terrible class of outcasts
experienced a feeling of revulsion that amounted almost to horror
Was his being there not an ugly dream What had he in common with such
ruffians Then in a flash of memory came the painful proofhe was a
criminal in sight of Texas law he too was an outcast

For the moment Duane was wrapped up in painful reflections but Euchres
heavy hand clapping with a warning hold on his arm brought him back to
outside things

The hum of voices the clink of coin the loud laughter had ceased
There was a silence that manifestly had followed some unusual word or
action sufficient to still the room It was broken by a harsh curse and
the scrape of a bench on the floor Some man had risen

You stacked the cards you

Say that twice another voice replied so different in its cool
ominous tone from the other

Ill say it twice returned the first gamester in hot haste Ill
say it three times Ill whistle it Are you deaf You lightfingered
gent You stacked the cards

Silence ensued deeper than before pregnant with meaning For all that
Duane saw not an outlaw moved for a full moment Then suddenly the room
was full of disorder as men rose and ran and dived everywhere

Run or duck yelled Euchre close to Duanes ear With that he dashed
for the door Duane leaped after him They ran into a jostling mob
Heavy gunshots and hoarse yells hurried the crowd Duane was with
pellmell out into the darkness There they all halted and several
peeped in at the door

Who was the Kid callin asked one outlaw

Bud Marsh replied another

I reckon them fust shots was Buds Adios Kid It was comin to him
went on yet another

How many shots

Three or four I counted

Three heavy an one light Thet light one was the Kids38 Listen
Theres the Kid hollerin now He aint cashed anyway

At this juncture most of the outlaws began to file back into the room
Duane thought he had seen and heard enough in Bensons den for one night
and he started slowly down the walk Presently Euchre caught up with
him

Nobody hurt much whichs shore some strange he said The Kidyoung
Fuller thet I was tellin you abouthe was drinkin an losin Lost
his nut too callin Bud Marsh thet way Buds as straight at cards as
any of em Somebody grabbed Bud who shot into the roof An Fullers
arm was knocked up He only hit a greaser



CHAPTER VI

Next morning Duane found that a moody and despondent spell had fastened
on him Wishing to be alone he went out and walked a trail leading
round the river bluff He thought and thought After a while he made out
that the trouble with him probably was that he could not resign himself
to his fate He abhorred the possibility chance seemed to hold in store
for him He could not believe there was no hope But what to do appeared
beyond his power to tell

Duane had intelligence and keenness enough to see his perilthe
danger threatening his character as a man just as much as that which
threatened his life He cared vastly more he discovered for what he
considered honor and integrity than he did for life He saw that it was
bad for him to be alone But it appeared lonely months and perhaps
years inevitably must be his Another thing puzzled him In the bright
light of day he could not recall the state of mind that was his at
twilight or dusk or in the dark night By day these visitations became
to him what they really werephantoms of his conscience He could
dismiss the thought of them then He could scarcely remember or believe
that this strange feat of fancy or imagination had troubled him pained
him made him sleepless and sick

That morning Duane spent an unhappy hour wrestling decision out of the
unstable condition of his mind But at length he determined to create
interest in all that he came across and so forget himself as much as
possible He had an opportunity now to see just what the outlaws
life really was He meant to force himself to be curious sympathetic
clearsighted And he would stay there in the valley until its
possibilities had been exhausted or until circumstances sent him out
upon his uncertain way

When he returned to the shack Euchre was cooking dinner

Say Buck Ive news for you he said and his tone conveyed either
pride in his possession of such news or pride in Duane Feller named
Bradley rode in this mornin Hes heard some about you Told about the
ace of spades they put over the bullet holes in thet cowpuncher Bain
you plugged Then there was a rancher shot at a waterhole twenty miles
south of Wellston Reckon you didnt do it

No I certainly did not replied Duane

Wal you get the blame It aint nothin for a feller to be saddled
with gunplays he never made An Buck if you ever get famous as
seems likely youll be blamed for many a crime The borderll make an
outlaw an murderer out of you Wal thets enough of thet Ive more
news Youre goin to be popular

Popular What do you mean

I met Blands wife this mornin She seen you the other day when you
rode in She shore wants to meet you an so do some of the other women
in camp They always want to meet the new fellers whove just come
in Its lonesome for women here an they like to hear news from the
towns

Well Euchre I dont want to be impolite but Id rather not meet any
women rejoined Duane

I was afraid you wouldnt Dont blame you much Women are hell I was
hopin though you might talk a little to thet poor lonesome kid

What kid inquired Duane in surprise

Didnt I tell you about Jenniethe girl Blands holdin herethe one
Jackrabbit Benson had a hand in stealin

You mentioned a girl Thats all Tell me now replied Duane
abruptly

Wal I got it this way Mebbe its straight an mebbe it aint Some
years ago Benson made a trip over the river to buy mescal an other
drinks Hell sneak over there once in a while An as I get it he run
across a gang of greasers with some gringo prisoners I dont know but
I reckon there was some barterin perhaps murderin Anyway Benson
fetched the girl back She was more dead than alive But it turned out
she was only starved an scared half to death She hadnt been harmed
I reckon she was then about fourteen years old Bensons idee he said
was to use her in his den sellin drinks an the like But I never
went much on Jackrabbits word Bland seen the kid right off and took
herbought her from Benson You can gamble Bland didnt do thet from
notions of chivalry I aint gainsayin however but thet Jennie was
better off with Kate Bland Shes been hard on Jennie but shes kept
Bland an the other men from treatin the kid shameful Late Jennie has
growed into an allfired pretty girl an Kate is powerful jealous of
her I can see hell brewin over there in Blands cabin Thets why
I wish youd come over with me Blands hardly ever home His wifes
invited you Shore if she gets sweet on you as she has onWal thet
d complicate matters But youd get to see Jennie an mebbe you could
help her Mind I aint hintin nothin Im just wantin to put her
in your way Youre a man an can think fer yourself I had a baby girl
once an if shed lived she be as big as Jennie now an by Gawd I
wouldnt want her here in Blands camp

Ill go Euchre Take me over replied Duane He felt Euchres eyes
upon him The old outlaw however had no more to say

In the afternoon Euchre set off with Duane and soon they reached
Blands cabin Duane remembered it as the one where he had seen the
pretty woman watching him ride by He could not recall what she looked
like The cabin was the same as the other adobe structures in the
valley but it was larger and pleasantly located rather high up in a
grove of cottonwoods In the windows and upon the porch were evidences
of a womans hand Through the open door Duane caught a glimpse of
bright Mexican blankets and rugs

Euchre knocked upon the side of the door

Is that you Euchre asked a girls voice low hesitatingly The tone
of it rather deep and with a note of fear struck Duane He wondered
what she would be like

Yes its me Jennie Wheres Mrs Bland answered Euchre

She went over to Degers Theres somebody sick replied the girl

Euchre turned and whispered something about luck The snap of the
outlaws eyes was added significance to Duane

Jennie come out or let us come in Heres the young man I was tellin
you about Euchre said

Oh I cant I look soso

Never mind how you look interrupted the outlaw in a whisper It
aint no time to care fer thet Heres young Duane Jennie hes no
rustler no thief Hes different Come out Jennie an mebbe hell

Euchre did not complete his sentence He had spoken low with his glance
shifting from side to side

But what he said was sufficient to bring the girl quickly She appeared
in the doorway with downcast eyes and a stain of red in her white cheek
She had a pretty sad face and bright hair

Dont be bashful Jennie said Euchre You an Duane have a chance to
talk a little Now Ill go fetch Mrs Bland but I wont be hurryin

With that Euchre went away through the cottonwoods

Im glad to meet you MissMiss Jennie said Duane Euchre didnt
mention your last name He asked me to come over to

Duanes attempt at pleasantry halted short when Jennie lifted her lashes
to look at him Some kind of a shock went through Duane Her gray eyes
were beautiful but it had not been beauty that cut short his speech He
seemed to see a tragic struggle between hope and doubt that shone in her
piercing gaze She kept looking and Duane could not break the silence
It was no ordinary moment

What did you come here for she asked at last

To see you replied Duane glad to speak

Why

WellEuchre thoughthe wanted me to talk to you cheer you up a bit
replied Duane somewhat lamely The earnest eyes embarrassed him

Euchres good Hes the only person in this awful place whos been good
to me But hes afraid of Bland He said you were different Who are
you

Duane told her

Youre not a robber or rustler or murderer or some bad man come here to
hide

No Im not replied Duane trying to smile

Then why are you here

Im on the dodge You know what that means I got in a shootingscrape
at home and had to run off When it blows over I hope to go back

But you cant be honest here

Yes I can

Oh I know what these outlaws are Yes youre different She kept the
strained gaze upon him but hope was kindling and the hard lines of her
youthful face were softening

Something sweet and warm stirred deep in Duane as he realized the
unfortunate girl was experiencing a birth of trust in him

O God Maybe youre the man to save meto take me away before its too
late

Duanes spirit leaped

Maybe I am he replied instantly

She seemed to check a blind impulse to run into his arms Her cheek
flamed her lips quivered her bosom swelled under her ragged dress
Then the glow began to fade doubt once more assailed her

It cant be Youre onlyafter me too like Blandlike all of them

Duanes long arms went out and his hands clasped her shoulders He shook
her

Look at mestraight in the eye There are decent men Havent you a
fathera brother

Theyre deadkilled by raiders We lived in Dimmit County I was
carried away Jennie replied hurriedly She put up an appealing hand
to him Forgive me I believeI know youre good It was onlyI live
so much in fearIm half crazyIve almost forgotten what good men are
like Mister Duane youll help me

Yes Jennie I will Tell me how What must I do Have you any plan

Oh no But take me away

Ill try said Duane simply That wont be easy though I must
have time to think You must help me There are many things to consider
Horses food trails and then the best time to make the attempt Are
you watchedkept prisoner

No I could have run off lots of times But I was afraid Id only have
fallen into worse hands Euchre has told me that Mrs Bland beats me
half starves me but she has kept me from her husband and these other
dogs Shes been as good as that and Im grateful She hasnt done it
for love of me though She always hated me And lately shes growing
jealous There was a man came here by the name of Spenceso he called
himself He tried to be kind to me But she wouldnt let him She was
in love with him Shes a bad woman Bland finally shot Spence and
that ended that Shes been jealous ever since I hear her fighting with
Bland about me She swears shell kill me before he gets me And Bland
laughs in her face Then Ive heard Chess Alloway try to persuade Bland
to give me to him But Bland doesnt laugh then Just lately before
Bland went away things almost came to a head I couldnt sleep I wished
Mrs Bland would kill me Ill certainly kill myself if they ruin me
Duane you must be quick if youd save me

I realize that replied he thoughtfully I think my difficulty will
be to fool Mrs Bland If she suspected me shed have the whole gang of
outlaws on me at once

She would that Youve got to be carefuland quick

What kind of woman is she inquired Duane

Shesshes brazen Ive heard her with her lovers They get drunk
sometimes when Blands away Shes got a terrible temper Shes vain
She likes flattery Oh you could fool her easy enough if youd lower
yourself toto

To make love to her interrupted Duane

Jennie bravely turned shamed eyes to meet his

My girl Id do worse than that to get you away from here he said
bluntly

ButDuane she faltered and again she put out the appealing hand
Bland will kill you

Duane made no reply to this He was trying to still a rising strange
tumult in his breast The old emotionthe rush of an instinct to kill
He turned cold all over

Chess Alloway will kill you if Bland doesnt went on Jennie with her
tragic eyes on Duanes

Maybe he will replied Duane It was difficult for him to force a
smile But he achieved one

Oh better take me off at once she said Save me without risking so
muchwithout making love to Mrs Bland

Surely if I can There I see Euchre coming with a woman

Thats her Oh she mustnt see me with you

Waita moment whispered Duane as Jennie slipped indoors Weve
settled it Dont forget Ill find some way to get word to you perhaps
through Euchre Meanwhile keep up your courage Remember Ill save you
somehow Well try strategy first Whatever you see or hear me do dont
think less of me

Jennie checked him with a gesture and a wonderful gray flash of eyes

Ill bless you with every drop of blood in my heart she whispered
passionately

It was only as she turned away into the room that Duane saw she was lame
and that she wore Mexican sandals over bare feet

He sat down upon a bench on the porch and directed his attention to the
approaching couple The trees of the grove were thick enough for him to
make reasonably sure that Mrs Bland had not seen him talking to Jennie
When the outlaws wife drew near Duane saw that she was a tall
strong fullbodied woman rather goodlooking with a fullblown bold
attractiveness Duane was more concerned with her expression than with
her good looks and as she appeared unsuspicious he felt relieved The
situation then took on a singular zest

Euchre came up on the porch and awkwardly introduced Duane to Mrs
Bland She was young probably not over twentyfive and not quite so
prepossessing at close range Her eyes were large rather prominent and
brown in color Her mouth too was large with the lips full and she
had white teeth

Duane took her proffered hand and remarked frankly that he was glad to
meet her

Mrs Bland appeared pleased and her laugh which followed was loud and
rather musical

Mr DuaneBuck Duane Euchre said didnt he she asked

Buckley corrected Duane The nicknames not of my choosing

Im certainly glad to meet you Buckley Duane she said as she took
the seat Duane offered her Sorry to have been out Kid Fullers lying
over at Degers You know he was shot last night Hes got fever today
When Blands away I have to nurse all these shotup boys and it
sure takes my time Have you been waiting here alone Didnt see that
slattern girl of mine

She gave him a sharp glance The woman had an extraordinary play of
feature Duane thought and unless she was smiling was not pretty at
all

Ive been alone replied Duane Havent seen anybody but a
sicklooking girl with a bucket And she ran when she saw me

That was Jen said Mrs Bland Shes the kid we keep here and she
sure hardly pays her keep Did Euchre tell you about her

Now that I think of it he did say something or other

What did he tell you about me bluntly asked Mrs Bland

Wal Kate replied Euchre speaking for himself you neednt worry
none for I told Buck nothin but compliments

Evidently the outlaws wife liked Euchre for her keen glance rested
with amusement upon him

As for Jen Ill tell you her story some day went on the woman Its
a common enough story along this river Euchre here is a tenderhearted
old fool and Jen has taken him in

Wal seein as youve got me figgered correct replied Euchre dryly
Ill go in an talk to Jennie if I may

Certainly Go ahead Jen calls you her best friend said Mrs Bland
amiably Youre always fetching some Mexican stuff and thats why I
guess

When Euchre had shuffled into the house Mrs Bland turned to Duane with
curiosity and interest in her gaze

Bland told me about you

What did he say queried Duane in pretended alarm

Oh you neednt think hes done you dirt Blands not that kind of a
man He said Kate theres a young fellow in camprode in here on the
dodge Hes no criminal and he refused to join my band Wish he would
Slickest hand with a gun Ive seen for many a day Id like to see him
and Chess meet out there in the road Then Bland went on to tell how
you and Bosomer came together

What did you say inquired Duane as she paused

Me Why I asked him what you looked like she replied gayly

Well went on Duane

Magnificent chap Bland said Bigger than any man in the valley Just a
great blueeyed sunburned boy

Humph exclaimed Duane Im sorry he led you to expect somebody worth
seeing

But Im not disappointed she returned archly Duane are you going
to stay long here in camp

Yes till I run out of money and have to move Why

Mrs Blands face underwent one of the singular changes The smiles and
flushes and glances all that had been coquettish about her had lent
her a certain attractiveness almost beauty and youth But with some
powerful emotion she changed and instantly became a woman of discontent
Duane imagined of deep violent nature

Ill tell you Duane she said earnestly Im sure glad if you mean
to bide here awhile Im a miserable woman Duane Im an outlaws wife
and I hate him and the life I have to lead I come of a good family in
Brownsville I never knew Bland was an outlaw till long after he married
me We were separated at times and I imagined he was away on business
But the truth came out Bland shot my own cousin who told me My family
cast me off and I had to flee with Bland I was only eighteen then
Ive lived here since I never see a decent woman or man I never hear
anything about my old home or folks or friends Im buried hereburied
alive with a lot of thieves and murderers Can you blame me for being
glad to see a young fellowa gentlemanlike the boys I used to go
with I tell you it makes me feel fullI want to cry Im sick for
somebody to talk to I have no children thank God If I had Id not
stay here Im sick of this hole Im lonely

There appeared to be no doubt about the truth of all this Genuine
emotion checked then halted the hurried speech She broke down and
cried It seemed strange to Duane that an outlaws wifeand a woman
who fitted her consort and the wild nature of their surroundingsshould
have weakness enough to weep Duane believed and pitied her

Im sorry for you he said

Dont be SORRY for me she said That only makes me see thethe
difference between you and me And dont pay any attention to what these
outlaws say about me Theyre ignorant They couldnt understand me
Youll hear that Bland killed men who ran after me But thats a lie
Bland like all the other outlaws along this river is always looking
for somebody to kill He SWEARS not but I dont believe him He
explains that gunplay gravitates to men who are the real thingthat it
is provoked by the fourflushes the bad men I dont know All I know
is that somebody is being killed every other day He hated Spence before
Spence ever saw me

Would Bland object if I called on you occasionally inquired Duane

No he wouldnt He likes me to have friends Ask him yourself when he
comes back The trouble has been that two or three of his men fell in
love with me and when half drunk got to fighting Youre not going to
do that

Im not going to get half drunk thats certain replied Duane

He was surprised to see her eyes dilate then glow with fire Before
she could reply Euchre returned to the porch and that put an end to the
conversation

Duane was content to let the matter rest there and had little more to
say Euchre and Mrs Bland talked and joked while Duane listened
He tried to form some estimate of her character Manifestly she had
suffered a wrong if not worse at Blands hands She was bitter
morbid overemotional If she was a liar which seemed likely enough
she was a frank one and believed herself She had no cunning The thing
which struck Duane so forcibly was that she thirsted for respect
In that better than in her weakness of vanity he thought he had
discovered a trait through which he could manage her

Once while he was revolving these thoughts he happened to glance into
the house and deep in the shadow of a corner he caught a pale gleam
of Jennies face with great staring eyes on him She had been watching
him listening to what he said He saw from her expression that she had
realized what had been so hard for her to believe Watching his chance
he flashed a look at her and then it seemed to him the change in her
face was wonderful

Later after he had left Mrs Bland with a meaning Adiosmanana and
was walking along beside the old outlaw he found himself thinking of
the girl instead of the woman and of how he had seen her face blaze
with hope and gratitude



CHAPTER VII

That night Duane was not troubled by ghosts haunting his waking and
sleeping hours He awoke feeling bright and eager and grateful to
Euchre for having put something worth while into his mind During
breakfast however he was unusually thoughtful working over the idea
of how much or how little he would confide in the outlaw He was aware
of Euchres scrutiny

Wal began the old man at last howd you make out with the kid

Kid inquired Duane tentatively

Jennie I mean Whatd you An she talk about

We had a little chat You know you wanted me to cheer her up

Euchre sat with coffeecup poised and narrow eyes studying Duane

Reckon you cheered her all right What Im afeared of is mebbe you
done the job too well

How so

Wal when I went in to Jen last night I thought she was half crazy
She was burstin with excitement an the look in her eyes hurt me She
wouldnt tell me a darn word you said But she hung onto my hands
an showed every way without speakin how she wanted to thank me fer
bringin you over Buck it was plain to me thet youd either gone the
limit or else youd been kinder prodigal of cheer an hope Id hate to
think youd led Jennie to hope moren ever would come true

Euchre paused and as there seemed no reply forthcoming he went on

Buck Ive seen some outlaws whose word was good Mine is You can
trust me I trusted you didnt I takin you over there an puttin you
wise to my tryin to help thet poor kid

Thus enjoined by Euchre Duane began to tell the conversations with
Jennie and Mrs Bland word for word Long before he had reached an end
Euchre set down the coffeecup and began to stare and at the conclusion
of the story his face lost some of its red color and beads of sweat
stood out thickly on his brow

Wal if thet doesnt floor me he ejaculated blinking at Duane
Young man I figgered you was some swift an sure to make your mark on
this river but I reckon I missed your real caliber So thets what
it means to be a man I guess Id forgot Wal Im old an even if my
heart was in the right place I never was built fer big stunts Do you
know what itll take to do all you promised Jen

I havent any idea replied Duane gravely

Youll have to pull the wool over Kate Blands eyes ant even if she
falls in love with you whichs shore likely thet wont be easy
An shed kill you in a minnit Buck if she ever got wise You aint
mistaken her none are you

Not me Euchre Shes a woman Id fear her more than any man

Wal youll have to kill Bland an Chess Alloway an Rugg an mebbe
some others before you can ride off into the hills with thet girl

Why Cant we plan to be nice to Mrs Bland and then at an opportune
time sneak off without any gunplay

Dont see how on earth returned Euchre earnestly When Blands
away he leaves all kinds of spies an scouts watchin the valley trails
Theyve all got rifles You couldnt git by them But when the boss is
home theres a difference Only of course him an Chess keep their
eyes peeled They both stay to home pretty much except when theyre
playin monte or poker over at Bensons So I say the best bet is to
pick out a good time in the afternoon drift over carelesslike with a
couple of hosses choke Mrs Bland or knock her on the head take Jennie
with you an make a rush to git out of the valley If you had luck you
might pull thet stunt without throwin a gun But I reckon the best
figgerin would include dodgin some lead an leavin at least Bland or
Alloway dead behind you Im figgerin of course thet when they come
home an find out youre visitin Kate frequent theyll jest naturally
look fer results Chess dont like you fer no reason except youre
swift on the drawmebbe swifter n him Thets the hell of this
gunplay business No one can ever tell whos the swifter of two gunmen
till they meet Thet fact holds a fascination mebbe youll learn some
day Bland would treat you civil onless there was reason not to an
then I dont believe hed invite himself to a meetin with you Hed set
Chess or Rugg to put you out of the way Still Blands no coward an if
you came across him at a bad moment youd have to be quicker n you was
with Bosomer

All right Ill meet what comes said Duane quickly The great point
is to have horses ready and pick the right moment then rush the trick
through

Thets the ONLY chance fer success An you cant do it alone

Ill have to I wouldnt ask you to help me Leave you behind

Wal Ill take my chances replied Euchre gruffly Im goin to help
Jennie you can gamble your last peso on thet Theres only four men in
this camp who would shoot meBland an his righthand pards an thet
rabbitfaced Benson If you happened to put out Bland and Chess Id
stand a good show with the other two Anyway Im old an tiredwhats
the difference if I do git plugged I can risk as much as you Buck
even if I am afraid of gunplay You said correct Hosses ready the
right minnit then rush the trick Thet much s settled Now lets
figger all the little details

They talked and planned though in truth it was Euchre who planned
Duane who listened and agreed While awaiting the return of Bland and
his lieutenants it would be well for Duane to grow friendly with the
other outlaws to sit in a few games of monte or show a willingness
to spend a little money The two schemers were to call upon Mrs Bland
every dayEuchre to carry messages of cheer and warning to Jennie
Duane to blind the elder woman at any cost These preliminaries decided
upon they proceeded to put them into action

No hard task was it to win the friendship of the most of those
goodnatured outlaws They were used to men of a better order than
theirs coming to the hidden camps and sooner or later sinking to their
lower level Besides with them everything was easy come easy go That
was why life itself went on so carelessly and usually ended so cheaply
There were men among them however that made Duane feel that terrible
inexplicable wrath rise in his breast He could not bear to be near
them He could not trust himself He felt that any instant a word
a deed something might call too deeply to that instinct he could no
longer control Jackrabbit Benson was one of these men Because of
him and other outlaws of his ilk Duane could scarcely ever forget
the reality of things This was a hidden valley a robbers den a
rendezvous for murderers a wild place stained red by deeds of wild men
And because of that there was always a charged atmosphere The merriest
idlest most careless moment might in the flash of an eye end in
ruthless and tragic action In an assemblage of desperate characters it
could not be otherwise The terrible thing that Duane sensed was this
The valley was beautiful sunny fragrant a place to dream in the
mountaintops were always blue or gold rimmed the yellow river slid
slowly and majestically by the birds sang in the cottonwoods the
horses grazed and pranced children played and women longed for love
freedom happiness the outlaws rode in and out free with money and
speech they lived comfortably in their adobe homes smoked gambled
talked laughed whiled away the idle hoursand all the time life there
was wrong and the simplest moment might be precipitated by that evil
into the most awful of contrasts Duane felt rather than saw a dark
brooding shadow over the valley

Then without any solicitation or encouragement from Duane the Bland
woman fell passionately in love with him His conscience was never
troubled about the beginning of that affair She launched herself It
took no great perspicuity on his part to see that And the thing which
evidently held her in check was the newness the strangeness and for
the moment the allsatisfying fact of his respect for her Duane exerted
himself to please to amuse to interest to fascinate her and always
with deference That was his strong point and it had made his part
easy so far He believed he could carry the whole scheme through without
involving himself any deeper

He was playing at a game of loveplaying with life and deaths Sometimes
he trembled not that he feared Bland or Alloway or any other man but
at the deeps of life he had come to see into He was carried out of his
old mood Not once since this daring motive had stirred him had he
been haunted by the phantom of Bain beside his bed Rather had he been
haunted by Jennies sad face her wistful smile her eyes He never was
able to speak a word to her What little communication he had with her
was through Euchre who carried short messages But he caught glimpses
of her every time he went to the Bland house She contrived somehow to
pass door or window to give him a look when chance afforded And Duane
discovered with surprise that these moments were more thrilling to
him than any with Mrs Bland Often Duane knew Jennie was sitting just
inside the window and then he felt inspired in his talk and it was
all made for her So at least she came to know him while as yet she was
almost a stranger Jennie had been instructed by Euchre to listen to
understand that this was Duanes only chance to help keep her mind from
constant worry to gather the import of every word which had a double
meaning

Euchre said that the girl had begun to wither under the strain to burn
up with intense hope which had flamed within her But all the difference
Duane could see was a paler face and darker more wonderful eyes The
eyes seemed to be entreating him to hurry that time was flying that
soon it might be too late Then there was another meaning in them a
light a strange fire wholly inexplicable to Duane It was only a flash
gone in an instant But he remembered it because he had never seen it in
any other womans eyes And all through those waiting days he knew that
Jennies face and especially the warm fleeting glance she gave him
was responsible for a subtle and gradual change in him This change
he fancied was only that through remembrance of her he got rid of his
pale sickening ghosts

One day a careless Mexican threw a lighted cigarette up into the brush
matting that served as a ceiling for Bensons den and there was a fire
which left little more than the adobe walls standing The result was
that while repairs were being made there was no gambling and drinking
Time hung very heavily on the hands of some twoscore outlaws Days
passed by without a brawl and Blands valley saw more successive hours
of peace than ever before Duane however found the hours anything but
empty He spent more time at Mrs Blands he walked miles on all the
trails leading out of the valley he had a care for the condition of his
two horses

Upon his return from the latest of these tramps Euchre suggested that
they go down to the river to the boatlanding

Ferry couldnt run ashore this mornin said Euchre River gettin
low an sandbars makin it hard fer hosses Theres a greaser
freightwagon stuck in the mud I reckon we might hear news from the
freighters Blands supposed to be in Mexico

Nearly all the outlaws in camp were assembled on the riverbank lolling
in the shade of the cottonwoods The heat was oppressive Not an
outlaw offered to help the freighters who were trying to dig a heavily
freighted wagon out of the quicksand Few outlaws would work for
themselves let alone for the despised Mexicans

Duane and Euchre joined the lazy group and sat down with them Euchre
lighted a black pipe and drawing his hat over his eyes lay back in
comfort after the manner of the majority of the outlaws But Duane
was alert observing thoughtful He never missed anything It was
his belief that any moment an idle word might be of benefit to him
Moreover these rough men were always interesting

Blands been chased across the river said one

New hes deliverin cattle to thet Cuban ship replied another

Big deal on hey

Some big Rugg says the boss hed an order fer fifteen thousand

Say that orderll take a year to fill

New Hardin is in cahoots with Bland Between em theyll fill orders
bigger n thet

Wondered what Hardin was rustlin in here fer

Duane could not possibly attend to all the conversation among the
outlaws He endeavored to get the drift of talk nearest to him

Kid Fullers goin to cash said a sandywhiskered little outlaw

So Jim was tellin me Bloodpoison aint it Thet hole wasnt bad
But he took the fever rejoined a comrade

Deger says the Kid might pull through if he hed nursin

Wal Kate Bland aint nursin any shotup boys these days She hasnt
got time

A laugh followed this sally then came a penetrating silence Some of
the outlaws glanced goodnaturedly at Duane They bore him no ill will
Manifestly they were aware of Mrs Blands infatuation

Pete pears to me youve said thet before

Shore Wal its happened before

This remark drew louder laughter and more significant glances at Duane
He did not choose to ignore them any longer

Boys poke all the fun you like at me but dont mention any ladys
name again My hand is nervous and itchy these days

He smiled as he spoke and his speech was drawled but the good humor in
no wise weakened it Then his latter remark was significant to a class
of men who from inclination and necessity practiced at gundrawing until
they wore callous and sore places on their thumbs and inculcated in
the very deeps of their nervous organization a habit that made even the
simplest and most innocent motion of the hand end at or near the hip
There was something remarkable about a gunfighters hand It never
seemed to be gloved never to be injured never out of sight or in an
awkward position

There were grizzled outlaws in that group some of whom had many notches
on their gunhandles and they with their comrades accorded Duane
silence that carried conviction of the regard in which he was held

Duane could not recall any other instance where he had let fall a
familiar speech to these men and certainly he had never before hinted
of his possibilities He saw instantly that he could not have done
better

Orful hot aint it remarked Bill Black presently Bill could not
keep quiet for long He was a typical Texas desperado had never been
anything else He was stoopshouldered and bowlegged from much riding
a wiry little man all muscle with a square head a hard face partly
black from scrubby beard and red from sun and a bright roving cruel
eye His shirt was open at the neck showing a grizzled breast

Is there any guy in this heah outfit sport enough to go swimmin he
asked

My Gawd Bill you aint agoin to wash exclaimed a comrade

This raised a laugh in which Black joined But no one seemed eager to
join him in a bath

Laziest outfit I ever rustled with went on Bill discontentedly
Nuthin to do Say if nobody wants to swim maybe some of youll
gamble

He produced a dirty pack of cards and waved them at the motionless
crowd

Bill youre too good at cards replied a lanky outlaw

Now Jasper you say thet powerful sweet an you look sweet er I
might take it to heart replied Black with a sudden change of tone

Here it was againthat upflashing passion What Jasper saw fit to reply
would mollify the outlaw or it would not There was an even balance

No offense Bill said Jasper placidly without moving

Bill grunted and forgot Jasper But he seemed restless and dissatisfied
Duane knew him to be an inveterate gambler And as Bensons place was
out of runningorder Black was like a fish on dry land

Wal if youall are afraid of the cairds what will you bet on he
asked in disgust

Bill Ill play you a game of mumbly peg fer two bits replied one

Black eagerly accepted Betting to him was a serious matter The game
obsessed him not the stakes He entered into the mumbly peg contest
with a thoughtful mien and a corded brow He won Other comrades tried
their luck with him and lost Finally when Bill had exhausted their
supply of twobit pieces or their desire for that particular game he
offered to bet on anything

See thet turtledove there he said pointing Ill bet hell scare
at one stone or he wont Five pesos hell fly or he wont fly when some
one chucks a stone Wholl take me up

That appeared to be more than the gambling spirit of several outlaws
could withstand

Take thet Easy money said one

Whos goin to chuck the stone asked another

Anybody replied Bill

Wal Ill bet you I can scare him with one stone said the first
outlaw

Were in on thet Jim to fire the darnick chimed in the others

The money was put up the stone thrown The turtledove took flight to
the great joy of all the outlaws except Bill

Ill bet youall hell come back to thet tree inside of five minnits
he offered imperturbably

Hereupon the outlaws did not show any laziness in their alacrity to
cover Bills money as it lay on the grass Somebody had a watch and
they all sat down dividing attention between the timepiece and the
tree The minutes dragged by to the accompaniment of various jocular
remarks anent a fool and his money When four and threequarter minutes
had passed a turtledove alighted in the cottonwood Then ensued an
impressive silence while Bill calmly pocketed the fifty dollars

But it hadnt the same dove exclaimed one outlaw excitedly This
nis smaller dustier not so purple

Bill eyed the speaker loftily

Wal youll have to ketch the other one to prove thet Sabe pard Now
Ill bet any gent heah the fifty I won thet I can scare thet dove with
one stone

No one offered to take his wager

Wal then Ill bet any of you even money thet you CANT scare him with
one stone

Not proof against this chance the outlaws made up a purse in no wise
disconcerted by Bills contemptuous allusions to their banding together
The stone was thrown The dove did not fly Thereafter in regard to
that bird Bill was unable to coax or scorn his comrades into any kind
of wager

He tried them with a multiplicity of offers and in vain Then he
appeared at a loss for some unusual and seductive wager Presently a
little ragged Mexican boy came along the river trail a particularly
starved and poorlooking little fellow Bill called to him and gave him
a handful of silver coins Speechless dazed he went his way hugging
the money

Ill bet he drops some before he gits to the road declared Bill
Ill bet he runs Hurry you fourflush gamblers

Bill failed to interest any of his companions and forthwith became
sullen and silent Strangely his good humor departed in spite of the
fact that he had won considerable

Duane watching the disgruntled outlaw marveled at him and wondered
what was in his mind These men were more variable than children as
unstable as water as dangerous as dynamite

Bill Ill bet you ten you cant spill whatevers in the bucket thet
peons packin said the outlaw called Jim

Blacks head came up with the action of a hawk about to swoop

Duane glanced from Black to the road where he saw a crippled peon
carrying a tin bucket toward the river This peon was a halfwitted
Indian who lived in a shack and did odd jobs for the Mexicans Duane had
met him often

Jim Ill take you up replied Black

Something perhaps a harshness in his voice caused Duane to whirl He
caught a leaping gleam in the outlaws eye

Aw Bill thets too fur a shot said Jasper as Black rested an elbow
on his knee and sighted over the long heavy Colt The distance to the
peon was about fifty paces too far for even the most expert shot to hit
a moving object so small as a bucket

Duane marvelously keen in the alignment of sights was positive that
Black held too high Another look at the hard face now tense and dark
with blood confirmed Duanes suspicion that the outlaw was not aiming
at the bucket at all Duane leaped and struck the leveled gun out of his
hand Another outlaw picked it up

Black fell back astounded Deprived of his weapon he did not seem the
same man or else he was cowed by Duanes significant and formidable
front Sullenly he turned away without even asking for his gun



CHAPTER VIII

What a contrast Duane thought the evening of that day presented to the
state of his soul

The sunset lingered in golden glory over the distant Mexican mountains
twilight came slowly a faint breeze blew from the river cool and sweet
the late cooing of a dove and the tinkle of a cowbell were the only
sounds a serene and tranquil peace lay over the valley

Inside Duanes body there was strife This third facing of a desperate
man had thrown him off his balance It had not been fatal but it
threatened so much The better side of his nature seemed to urge him
to die rather than to go on fighting or opposing ignorant unfortunate
savage men But the perversity of him was so great that it dwarfed
reason conscience He could not resist it He felt something dying in
him He suffered Hope seemed far away Despair had seized upon him and
was driving him into a reckless mood when he thought of Jennie

He had forgotten her He had forgotten that he had promised to save her
He had forgotten that he meant to snuff out as many lives as might stand
between her and freedom The very remembrance sheered off his morbid
introspection She made a difference How strange for him to realize
that He felt grateful to her He had been forced into outlawry she had
been stolen from her people and carried into captivity They had met in
the river fastness he to instil hope into her despairing life she to
be the means perhaps of keeping him from sinking to the level of her
captors He became conscious of a strong and beating desire to see her
talk with her

These thoughts had run through his mind while on his way to Mrs Blands
house He had let Euchre go on ahead because he wanted more time
to compose himself Darkness had about set in when he reached his
destination There was no light in the house Mrs Bland was waiting for
him on the porch

She embraced him and the sudden violent unfamiliar contact sent such
a shock through him that he all but forgot the deep game he was playing
She however in her agitation did not notice his shrinking From her
embrace and the tender incoherent words that flowed with it he gathered
that Euchre had acquainted her of his action with Black

He might have killed you she whispered more clearly and if Duane
had ever heard love in a voice he heard it then It softened him After
all she was a woman weak fated through her nature unfortunate in
her experience of life doomed to unhappiness and tragedy He met her
advance so far that he returned the embrace and kissed her Emotion such
as she showed would have made any woman sweet and she had a certain
charm It was easy even pleasant to kiss her but Duane resolved that
whatever her abandonment might become he would not go further than the
lie she made him act

Buck you love me she whispered

Yesyes he burst out eager to get it over and even as he spoke
he caught the pale gleam of Jennies face through the window He felt
a shame he was glad she could not see Did she remember that she had
promised not to misunderstand any action of his What did she think of
him seeing him out there in the dusk with this bold woman in his
arms Somehow that dim sight of Jennies pale face the big dark eyes
thrilled him inspired him to his hard task of the present

Listen dear he said to the woman and he meant his words for the
girl Im going to take you away from this outlaw den if I have to kill
Bland Alloway Rugganybody who stands in my path You were dragged
here You are goodI know it Theres happiness for you somewherea
home among good people who will care for you Just wait till

His voice trailed off and failed from excess of emotion Kate Bland
closed her eyes and leaned her head on his breast Duane felt her heart
beat against his and conscience smote him a keen blow If she loved
him so much But memory and understanding of her character hardened him
again and he gave her such commiseration as was due her sex and no
more

Boy thats good of you she whispered but its too late Im done
for I cant leave Bland All I ask is that you love me a little and
stop your gunthrowing

The moon had risen over the eastern bulge of dark mountain and now the
valley was flooded with mellow light and shadows of cottonwoods wavered
against the silver

Suddenly the clipclop clipclop of hoofs caused Duane to raise his
head and listen Horses were coming down the road from the head of
the valley The hour was unusual for riders to come in Presently the
narrow moonlit lane was crossed at its far end by black moving objects
Two horses Duane discerned

Its Bland whispered the woman grasping Duane with shaking hands
You must run No hed see you That d be worse Its Bland I know
his horses trot

But you said he wouldnt mind my calling here protested Duane
Euchres with me Itll be all right

Maybe so she replied with visible effort at selfcontrol Manifestly
she had a great fear of Bland If I could only think

Then she dragged Duane to the door pushed him in

Euchre come out with me Duane you stay with the girl Ill tell
Bland youre in love with her Jen if you give us away Ill wring your
neck

The swift action and fierce whisper told Duane that Mrs Bland was
herself again Duane stepped close to Jennie who stood near the window
Neither spoke but her hands were outstretched to meet his own They
were small trembling hands cold as ice He held them close trying to
convey what he feltthat he would protect her She leaned against him
and they looked out of the window Duane felt calm and sure of himself
His most pronounced feeling besides that for the frightened girl was a
curiosity as to how Mrs Bland would rise to the occasion He saw the
riders dismount down the lane and wearily come forward A boy led away
the horses Euchre the old fox was talking loud and with remarkable
ease considering what he claimed was his natural cowardice

that was way back in the sixties about the time of the war he
was saying Rustlin cattle wasnt nuthin then to what it is now An
times is rougher these days This gunthrowin has come to be a disease
Men have an itch for the draw same as they used to have fer poker The
only real gambler outside of greasers we ever had here was Bill an I
presume Bill is burnin now

The approaching outlaws hearing voices halted a rod or so from the
porch Then Mrs Bland uttered an exclamation ostensibly meant to
express surprise and hurried out to meet them She greeted her husband
warmly and gave welcome to the other man Duane could not see well
enough in the shadow to recognize Blands companion but he believed it
was Alloway

Dogtired we are and starved said Bland heavily Whos here with
you

Thats Euchre on the porch Duane is inside at the window with Jen
replied Mrs Bland

Duane he exclaimed Then he whispered lowsomething Duane could not
catch

Why I asked him to come said the chiefs wife She spoke easily and
naturally and made no change in tone Jen has been ailing She gets
thinner and whiter every day Duane came here one day with Euchre saw
Jen and went loony over her pretty face same as all you men So I let
him come

Bland cursed low and deep under his breath The other man made a violent
action of some kind and apparently was quieted by a restraining hand

Kate you let Duane make love to Jennie queried Bland incredulously

Yes I did replied the wife stubbornly Why not Jens in love with
him If he takes her away and marries her she can be a decent woman

Bland kept silent a moment then his laugh pealed out loud and harsh

Chess did you get that Well by God what do you think of my wife

Shes lyin or shes crazy replied Alloway and his voice carried an
unpleasant ring

Mrs Bland promptly and indignantly told her husbands lieutenant to
keep his mouth shut

Ho ho ho rolled out Blands laugh

Then he led the way to the porch his spurs clinking the weapons he was
carrying rattling and he flopped down on a bench

How are you boss asked Euchre

Hello old man Im well but all in

Alloway slowly walked on to the porch and leaned against the rail
He answered Euchres greeting with a nod Then he stood there a dark
silent figure

Mrs Blands full voice in eager questioning had a tendency to ease
the situation Bland replied briefly to her reporting a remarkably
successful trip

Duane thought it time to show himself He had a feeling that Bland and
Alloway would let him go for the moment They were plainly nonplussed
and Alloway seemed sullen brooding Jennie whispered Duane that
was clever of Mrs Bland Well keep up the deception Any day now be
ready

She pressed close to him and a barely audible Hurry came breathing
into his ear

Good night Jennie he said aloud Hope you feel better tomorrow

Then he stepped out into the moonlight and spoke Bland returned the
greeting and though he was not amiable he did not show resentment

Met Jasper as I rode in said Bland presently He told me you made
Bill Black mad and theres liable to be a fight What did you go off
the handle about

Duane explained the incident Im sorry I happened to be there he
went on It wasnt my business

Scurvy trick that d been muttered Bland You did right All the
same Duane I want you to stop quarreling with my men If you were one
of usthatd be different I cant keep my men from fighting But
Im not called on to let an outsider hang around my camp and plug my
rustlers

I guess Ill have to be hitting the trail for somewhere said Duane

Why not join my band Youve got a bad start already Duane and if I
know this border youll never be a respectable citizen again Youre
a born killer I know every bad man on this frontier More than one of
them have told me that something exploded in their brain and when sense
came back there lay another dead man Its not so with me Ive done a
little shooting too but I never wanted to kill another man just to
rid myself of the last one My dead men dont sit on my chest at night
Thats the gunfighters trouble Hes crazy He has to kill a new
manhes driven to it to forget the last one

But Im no gunfighter protested Duane Circumstances made me

No doubt interrupted Bland with a laugh Circumstances made me a
rustler You dont know yourself Youre young youve got a temper
your father was one of the most dangerous men Texas ever had I dont
see any other career for you Instead of going it alonea lone wolf
as the Texans saywhy not make friends with other outlaws Youll live
longer

Euchre squirmed in his seat

Boss Ive been givin the boy egzactly thet same line of talk Thets
why I took him in to bunk with me If he makes pards among us there
wont be any more trouble An hed be a grand feller fer the gang Ive
seen Wild Bill Hickok throw a gun an Billy the Kid an Hardin an
Chess hereall the fastest men on the border An with apologies to
present company Im here to say Duane has them all skinned His draw is
different You cant see how he does it

Euchres admiring praise served to create an effective little silence
Alloway shifted uneasily on his feet his spurs jangling faintly and
did not lift his head Bland seemed thoughtful

Thats about the only qualification I have to make me eligible for your
band said Duane easily

Its good enough replied Bland shortly Will you consider the
idea

Ill think it over Good night

He left the group followed by Euchre When they reached the end of the
lane and before they had exchanged a word Bland called Euchre back
Duane proceeded slowly along the moonlit road to the cabin and sat down
under the cottonwoods to wait for Euchre The night was intense and
quiet a low hum of insects giving the effect of a congestion of life
The beauty of the soaring moon the ebony canons of shadow under the
mountain the melancholy serenity of the perfect night made Duane
shudder in the realization of how far aloof he now was from enjoyment of
these things Never again so long as he lived could he be natural His
mind was clouded His eye and ear henceforth must register impressions
of nature but the joy of them had fled

Still as he sat there with a foreboding of more and darker work ahead
of him there was yet a strange sweetness left to him and it lay in
thought of Jennie The pressure of her cold little hands lingered in
his He did not think of her as a woman and he did not analyze his
feelings He just had vague dreamy thoughts and imaginations that were
interspersed in the constant and stern revolving of plans to save her

A shuffling step roused him Euchres dark figure came crossing the
moonlit grass under the cottonwoods The moment the outlaw reached
him Duane saw that he was laboring under great excitement It scarcely
affected Duane He seemed to be acquiring patience calmness strength

Bland kept you pretty long he said

Wait till I git my breath replied Euchre He sat silent a little
while fanning himself with a sombrero though the night was cool and
then he went into the cabin to return presently with a lighted pipe

Fine night he said and his tone further acquainted Duane with
Euchres quaint humor Fine night for loveaffairs by gum

Id noticed that rejoined Duane dryly

Wal Im a son of a gun if I didnt stand an watch Bland choke his
wife till her tongue stuck out an she got black in the face

No ejaculated Duane

Hope to die if I didnt Buck listen to this here yarn When I got
back to the porch I seen Bland was wakin up Hed been too fagged out
to figger much Alloway an Kate had gone in the house where they lit
up the lamps I heard Kates high voice but Alloway never chirped Hes
not the talkin kind an hes damn dangerous when hes thet way Bland
asked me some questions right from the shoulder I was ready for them
an I swore the moon was green cheese He was satisfied Bland always
trusted me an liked me too I reckon I hated to lie black thet
way But hes a hard man with bad intentions toward Jennie an Id
doublecross him any day

Then we went into the house Jennie had gone to her little room
an Bland called her to come out She said she was undressin An he
ordered her to put her clothes back on Then Buck his next move was
some surprisin He deliberately thronged a gun on Kate Yes sir he
pointed his big blue Colt right at her an he says

Ive a mind to blow out your brains

Go ahead says Kate cool as could be

You lied to me he roars

Kate laughed in his face Bland slammed the gun down an made a grab
fer her She fought him but wasnt a match fer him an he got her by
the throat He choked her till I thought she was strangled Alloway made
him stop She flopped down on the bed an gasped fer a while When she
come to them hardshelled cusses went after her trying to make her give
herself away I think Bland was jealous He suspected shed got thick
with you an was foolin him I reckon thets a sore feelin fer a man
to haveto guess pretty nice but not to BE sure Bland gave it up
after a while An then he cussed an raved at her One sayin of his is
worth pinnin in your sombrero It aint nuthin to kill a man I dont
need much fer thet But I want to KNOW you hussy

Then he went in an dragged poor Jen out Shed had time to dress He
was so mad he hurt her sore leg You know Jen got thet injury fightin
off one of them devils in the dark An when I seen Bland twist
herhurt herI had a queer hot feelin deep down in me an fer the
only time in my life I wished I was a gunfighter

Wal Jen amazed me She was whitern a sheet an her eyes were big and
stary but she had nerve Fust time I ever seen her show any

Jennie he said my wife said Duane came here to see you I believe
shes lyin I think shes been carryin on with him an I want to
KNOW If shes been an you tell me the truth Ill let you go Ill send
you out to Huntsville where you can communicate with your friends Ill
give you money

Thet must hev been a hell of a minnit fer Kate Bland If evet I seen
death in a mans eye I seen it in Blands He loves her Thets the
strange part of it

Has Duane been comin here to see my wife Bland asked fiercelike

No said Jennie

Hes been after you

Yes

He has fallen in love with you Kate said thet

IIm notI dont knowhe hasnt told me

But youre in love with him

Yes she said an Buck if you only could have seen her She
thronged up her head an her eyes were full of fire Bland seemed dazed
at sight of her An Alloway why thet little skunk of an outlaw cried
right out He was hit plumb center Hes in love with Jen An the look
of her then was enough to make any feller quit He jest slunk out of the
room I told you mebbe thet hed been tryin to git Bland to marry Jen
to him So even a tough like Alloway can love a woman

Bland stamped up an down the room He sure was dyin hard

Jennie he said once more turnin to her You swear in fear of your
life thet youre tellin truth Kates not in love with Duane Shes let
him come to see you Theres been nuthin between them

No I swear answered Jennie an Bland sat down like a man licked

Go to bed you whitefaced Bland choked on some word or othera
bad one I reckonan he positively shook in his chair

Jennie went then an Kate began to have hysterics An your Uncle
Euchre ducked his nut out of the door an come home

Duane did not have a word to say at the end of Euchres long harangue
He experienced relief As a matter of fact he had expected a good deal
worse He thrilled at the thought of Jennie perjuring herself to save
that abandoned woman What mysteries these feminine creatures were

Wal theres where our little deal stands now resumed Euchre
meditatively You know Buck as well as me thet if youd been some
feller who hadnt shown he was a wonder with a gun youd now be full of
lead If youd happen to kill Bland an Alloway I reckon youd be as
safe on this here border as you would in Santone Such is gun fame in
this land of the draw



CHAPTER IX

Both men were awake early silent with the premonition of trouble ahead
thoughtful of the fact that the time for the longplanned action was at
hand It was remarkable that a man as loquacious as Euchre could hold
his tongue so long and this was significant of the deadly nature of
the intended deed During breakfast he said a few words customary in the
service of food At the conclusion of the meal he seemed to come to an
end of deliberation

Buck the sooner the better now he declared with a glint in his eye
The more time we use up now the less surprised Blandll be

Im ready when you are replied Duane quietly and he rose from the
table

Wal saddle up then went on Euchre gruffly Tie on them two packs
I made one fer each saddle You cant tellmebbe either hoss will be
carryin double Its good theyre both big strong hosses Guess thet
wasnt a wise move of your Uncle Euchresbringin in your hosses an
havin them ready

Euchre I hope youre not going to get in bad here Im afraid you are
Let me do the rest now said Duane

The old outlaw eyed him sarcastically

Thet d be turrible now wouldnt it If you want to know why Im in
bad already I didnt tell you thet Alloway called me last night Hes
gettin wise pretty quick

Euchre youre going with me queried Duane suddenly divining the
truth

Wal I reckon Either to hell or safe over the mountain I wisht I was
a gunfighter I hate to leave here without takin a peg at Jackrabbit
Benson Now Buck you do some hard figgerin while I go nosin round
Its pretty early which s all the better

Euchre put on his sombrero and as he went out Duane saw that he wore
a gunandcartridge belt It was the first time Duane had ever seen the
outlaw armed

Duane packed his few belongings into his saddlebags and then carried
the saddles out to the corral An abundance of alfalfa in the corral
showed that the horses had fared well They had gotten almost fat during
his stay in the valley He watered them put on the saddles loosely
cinched and then the bridles His next move was to fill the two canvas
waterbottles That done he returned to the cabin to wait

At the moment he felt no excitement or agitation of any kind There was
no more thinking and planning to do The hour had arrived and he was
ready He understood perfectly the desperate chances he must take
His thoughts became confined to Euchre and the surprising loyalty and
goodness in the hardened old outlaw Time passed slowly Duane kept
glancing at his watch He hoped to start the thing and get away before
the outlaws were out of their beds Finally he heard the shuffle of
Euchres boots on the hard path The sound was quicker than usual

When Euchre came around the corner of the cabin Duane was not so
astounded as he was concerned to see the outlaw white and shaking Sweat
dripped from him He had a wild look

Luck ourssofur Buck he panted

You dont look it replied Duane

Im turrible sick Jest killed a man Fust one I ever killed

Who asked Duane startled

Jackrabbit Benson An sick as I am Im gloryin in it I went nosin
round up the road Saw Alloway goin into Degers Hes thick with the
Degers Reckon hes askin questions Anyway I was sure glad to see him
away from Blands An he didnt see me When I dropped into Bensons
there wasnt nobody there but Jackrabbit an some greasers he was
startin to work Benson never had no use fer me An he up an said he
wouldnt give a twobit piece fer my life I asked him why

Youre doublecrossin the boss an Chess he said

Jack what d you give fer your own life I asked him

He straightened up surprised an meanlookin An I let him have it
plumb center He wilted an the greasers run I reckon Ill never sleep
again But I had to do it

Duane asked if the shot had attracted any attention outside

I didnt see anybody but the greasers an I sure looked sharp Comin
back I cut across through the cottonwoods past Blands cabin I meant to
keep out of sight but somehow I had an idee I might find out if Bland
was awake yet Sure enough I run plumb into Beppo the boy who tends
Blands hosses Beppo likes me An when I inquired of his boss he said
Bland had been up all night fightin with the Senora An Buck heres
how I figger Bland couldnt let up last night He was sore an he went
after Kate again tryin to wear her down Jest as likely he might have
went after Jennie with wuss intentions Anyway he an Kate must have
had it hot an heavy Were pretty lucky

It seems so Well Im going said Duane tersely

Lucky I should smiler Blands been up all night after a most draggin
ride home Hell be fagged out this mornin sleepy sore an he wont
be expectin hell before breakfast Now you walk over to his house
Meet him how you like Thets your game But Im suggestin if he comes
out an you want to parley you can jest say youd thought over his
proposition an was ready to join his band or you aint Youll have
to kill him an it d save time to go fer your gun on sight Might be
wise too fer its likely hell do thet same

How about the horses

Ill fetch them an come along about two minnits behind you Pears to
me you ought to have the job done an Jennie outside by the time I git
there Once on them hosses we can ride out of camp before Alloway or
anybody else gits into action Jennie aint much heavier than a rabbit
Thet big black will carry you both

All right But once more let me persuade you to staynot to mix any
more in this said Duane earnestly

Nope Im goin You heard what Benson told me Alloway wouldnt give
me the benefit of any doubts Buck a last wordlook out fer thet Bland
woman

Duane merely nodded and then saying that the horses were ready he
strode away through the grove Accounting for the short cut across grove
and field it was about five minutes walk up to Blands house To
Duane it seemed long in time and distance and he had difficulty in
restraining his pace As he walked there came a gradual and subtle
change in his feelings Again he was going out to meet a man in
conflict He could have avoided this meeting But despite the fact of
his courting the encounter he had not as yet felt that hot inexplicable
rush of blood The motive of this deadly action was not personal and
somehow that made a difference

No outlaws were in sight He saw several Mexican herders with cattle
Blue columns of smoke curled up over some of the cabins The fragrant
smell of it reminded Duane of his home and cutting wood for the stove
He noted a cloud of creamy mist rising above the river dissolving in
the sunlight

Then he entered Blands lane

While yet some distance from the cabin he heard loud angry voices of
man and woman Bland and Kate still quarreling He took a quick survey
of the surroundings There was now not even a Mexican in sight Then
he hurried a little Halfway down the lane he turned his head to peer
through the cottonwoods This time he saw Euchre coming with the horses
There was no indication that the old outlaw might lose his nerve at the
end Duane had feared this

Duane now changed his walk to a leisurely saunter He reached the porch
and then distinguished what was said inside the cabin

If you do Bland by Heaven Ill fix you and her That was panted out
in Kate Blands full voice

Let me looser Im going in there I tell you replied Bland hoarsely

What for

I want to make a little love to her Ha ha Itll be fun to have the
laugh on her new lover

You lie cried Kate Bland

Im not saying what Ill do to her AFTERWARD His voice grew hoarser
with passion Let me go now

No no I wont let you go Youll choke thethe truth out of
heryoull kill her

The TRUTH hissed Bland

Yes I lied Jen lied But she lied to save me You needntmurder
herfor that

Bland cursed horribly Then followed a wrestling sound of bodies in
violent straining contactthe scrape of feetthe jangle of spursa
crash of sliding table or chair and then the cry of a woman in pain

Duane stepped into the open door inside the room Kate Bland lay half
across a table where she had been flung and she was trying to get to
her feet Blands back was turned He had opened the door into Jennies
room and had one foot across the threshold Duane caught the girls low
shuddering cry Then he called out loud and clear

With catlike swiftness Bland wheeled then froze on the threshold
His sight quick as his action caught Duanes menacing unmistakable
position

Blands big frame filled the door He was in a bad place to reach for
his gun But he would not have time for a step Duane read in his eyes
the desperate calculation of chances For a fleeting instant Bland
shifted his glance to his wife Then his whole body seemed to vibrate
with the swing of his arm

Duane shot him He fell forward his gun exploding as it hit into the
floor and dropped loose from stretching fingers Duane stood over him
stooped to turn him on his back Bland looked up with clouded gaze then
gasped his last

Duane youve killed him cried Kate Bland huskily I knew youd
have to

She staggered against the wall her eyes dilating her strong hands
clenching her face slowly whitening She appeared shocked half
stunned but showed no grief

Jennie called Duane sharply

OhDuane came a halting reply

Yes Come out Hurry

She came out with uneven steps seeing only him and she stumbled over
Blands body Duane caught her arm swung her behind him He feared
the woman when she realized how she had been duped His action was
protective and his movement toward the door equally as significant

Duane cried Mrs Bland

It was no time for talk Duane edged on keeping Jennie behind him At
that moment there was a pounding of ironshod hoofs out in the lane
Kate Bland bounded to the door When she turned back her amazement was
changing to realization

Where re you taking Jen she cried her voice like a mans Get out
of my way replied Duane His look perhaps without speech was enough
for her In an instant she was transformed into a fury

You hound All the time you were fooling me You made love to me You
let me believeyou swore you loved me Now I see what was queer about
you All for that girl But you cant have her Youll never leave here
alive Give me that girl Let meget at her Shell never win any more
men in this camp

She was a powerful woman and it took all Duanes strength to ward off
her onslaughts She clawed at Jennie over his upheld arm Every second
her fury increased

HELP HELP HELP she shrieked in a voice that must have penetrated
to the remotest cabin in the valley

Let go Let go cried Duane low and sharp He still held his gun in
his right hand and it began to be hard for him to ward the woman off
His coolness had gone with her shriek for help Let go he repeated
and he shoved her fiercely

Suddenly she snatched a rifle off the wall and backed away her strong
hands fumbling at the lever As she jerked it down throwing a shell
into the chamber and cocking the weapon Duane leaped upon her He
struck up the rifle as it went off the powder burning his face

Jennie run out Get on a horse he said

Jennie flashed out of the door

With an iron grasp Duane held to the riflebarrel He had grasped it
with his left hand and he gave such a pull that he swung the crazed
woman off the floor But he could not loose her grip She was as strong
as he

Kate Let go

He tried to intimidate her She did not see his gun thrust in her face
or reason had given way to such an extent to passion that she did not
care She cursed Her husband had used the same curses and from her
lips they seemed strange unsexed more deadly Like a tigress she
fought him her face no longer resembled a womans The evil of that
outlaw life the wildness and rage the meaning to kill was even in
such a moment terribly impressed upon Duane

He heard a cry from outsidea mans cry hoarse and alarming

It made him think of loss of time This demon of a woman might yet block
his plan

Let go he whispered and felt his lips stiff In the grimness of that
instant he relaxed his hold on the riflebarrel

With sudden redoubled irresistible strength she wrenched the rifle
down and discharged it Duane felt a blowa shocka burning agony
tearing through his breast Then in a frenzy he jerked so powerfully
upon the rifle that he threw the woman against the wall She fell and
seemed stunned

Duane leaped back whirled flew out of the door to the porch The sharp
cracking of a gun halted him He saw Jennie holding to the bridle of his
bay horse Euchre was astride the other and he had a Colt leveled
and he was firing down the lane Then came a single shot heavier and
Euchres ceased He fell from the horse

A swift glance back showed to Duane a man coming down the lane Chess
Alloway His gun was smoking He broke into a run Then in an instant he
saw Duane and tried to check his pace as he swung up his arm But that
slight pause was fatal Duane shot and Alloway was falling when his gun
went off His bullet whistled close to Duane and thudded into the cabin

Duane bounded down to the horses Jennie was trying to hold the plunging
bay Euchre lay flat on his back dead a bullethole in his shirt his
face set hard and his hands twisted round gun and bridle

Jennie youve nerve all right cried Duane as he dragged down
the horse she was holding Up with you now There Never mindlong
stirrups Hang on somehow

He caught his bridle out of Euchres clutching grip and leaped astride
The frightened horses jumped into a run and thundered down the lane into
the road Duane saw men running from cabins He heard shouts But
there were no shots fired Jennie seemed able to stay on her horse but
without stirrups she was thrown about so much that Duane rode closer and
reached out to grasp her arm

Thus they rode through the valley to the trail that led up over the
steep and broken Rim Rock As they began to climb Duane looked back No
pursuers were in sight

Jennie were going to get away he cried exultation for her in his
voice

She was gazing horrorstricken at his breast as in turning to look back
he faced her

Oh Duane your shirts all bloody she faltered pointing with
trembling fingers

With her words Duane became aware of two thingsthe hand he
instinctively placed to his breast still held his gun and he had
sustained a terrible wound

Duane had been shot through the breast far enough down to give him grave
apprehension of his life The cleancut hole made by the bullet bled
freely both at its entrance and where it had come out but with no signs
of hemorrhage He did not bleed at the mouth however he began to cough
up a reddishtinged foam

As they rode on Jennie with pale face and mute lips looked at him

Im badly hurt Jennie he said but I guess Ill stick it out

The womandid she shoot you

Yes She was a devil Euchre told me to look out for her I wasnt
quick enough

You didnt have toto shivered the girl

No no he replied

They did not stop climbing while Duane tore a scarf and made compresses
which he bound tightly over his wounds The fresh horses made fast
time up the rough trail From open places Duane looked down When they
surmounted the steep ascent and stood on top of the Rim Rock with
no signs of pursuit down in the valley and with the wild broken
fastnesses before them Duane turned to the girl and assured her that
they now had every chance of escape

Butyourwound she faltered with dark troubled eyes I seethe
blooddripping from your back

Jennie Ill take a lot of killing he said

Then he became silent and attended to the uneven trail He was aware
presently that he had not come into Blands camp by this route But
that did not matter any trail leading out beyond the Rim Rock was safe
enough What he wanted was to get far away into some wild retreat where
he could hide till he recovered from his wound He seemed to feel a fire
inside his breast and his throat burned so that it was necessary for
him to take a swallow of water every little while He began to suffer
considerable pain which increased as the hours went by and then gave
way to a numbness From that time on he had need of his great strength
and endurance Gradually he lost his steadiness and his keen sight and
he realized that if he were to meet foes or if pursuing outlaws should
come up with him he could make only a poor stand So he turned off on a
trail that appeared seldom traveled

Soon after this move he became conscious of a further thickening of his
senses He felt able to hold on to his saddle for a while longer but he
was failing Then he thought he ought to advise Jennie so in case she
was left alone she would have some idea of what to do

Jennie Ill give out soon he said NoI dont meanwhat you think
But Ill drop soon My strengths going If I dieyou ride back to
the main trail Hide and rest by day Ride at night That trail goes
to water I believe you could get across the Nueces where some rancher
will take you in

Duane could not get the meaning of her incoherent reply He rode on
and soon he could not see the trail or hear his horse He did not
know whether they traveled a mile or many times that far But he was
conscious when the horse stopped and had a vague sense of falling and
feeling Jennies arms before all became dark to him

When consciousness returned he found himself lying in a little hut of
mesquite branches It was well built and evidently some years old There
were two doors or openings one in front and the other at the back
Duane imagined it had been built by a fugitiveone who meant to keep an
eye both ways and not to be surprised Duane felt weak and had no desire
to move Where was he anyway A strange intangible sense of time
distance of something far behind weighed upon him Sight of the two
packs Euchre had made brought his thought to Jennie What had become of
her There was evidence of her work in a smoldering fire and a little
blackened coffeepot Probably she was outside looking after the horses
or getting water He thought he heard a step and listened but he felt
tired and presently his eyes closed and he fell into a doze

Awakening from this he saw Jennie sitting beside him In some way
she seemed to have changed When he spoke she gave a start and turned
eagerly to him

Duane she cried

Hello Howre you Jennie and how am I he said finding it a little
difficult to talk

Oh Im all right she replied And youve come toyour wounds
healed but youve been sick Fever I guess I did all I could

Duane saw now that the difference in her was a whiteness and tightness
of skin a hollowness of eye a look of strain

Fever How long have we been here he asked

She took some pebbles from the crown of his sombrero and counted them

Nine Nine days she answered

Nine days he exclaimed incredulously But another look at her
assured him that she meant what she said Ive been sick all the time
You nursed me

Yes

Blands men didnt come along here

No

Where are the horses

I keep them grazing down in a gorge back of here Theres good grass
and water

Have you slept any

A little Lately I couldnt keep awake

Good Lord I should think not Youve had a time of it sitting here day
and night nursing me watching for the outlaws Come tell me all about
it

Theres nothing much to tell

I want to know anyway just what you didhow you felt

I cant remember very well she replied simply We must have ridden
forty miles that day we got away You bled all the time Toward evening
you lay on your horses neck When we came to this place you fell out of
the saddle I dragged you in here and stopped your bleeding I thought
youd die that night But in the morning I had a little hope I had
forgotten the horses But luckily they didnt stray far I caught them
and kept them down in the gorge When your wounds closed and you began
to breathe stronger I thought youd get well quick It was fever that
put you back You raved a lot and that worried me because I couldnt
stop you Anybody trailing us could have heard you a good ways I dont
know whether I was scared most then or when you were quiet and it was
so dark and lonely and still all around Every day I put a stone in your
hat

Jennie you saved my life said Duane

I dont know Maybe I did all I knew how to do she replied You
saved minemore than my life

Their eyes met in a long gaze and then their hands in a close clasp

Jennie were going to get away he said with gladness Ill be well
in a few days You dont know how strong I am Well hide by day and
travel by night I can get you across the river

And then she asked

Well find some honest rancher

And then she persisted

Why he began slowly thats as far as my thoughts ever got It
was pretty hard I tell you to assure myself of so much It means your
safety Youll tell your story Youll be sent to some village or town
and taken care of until a relative or friend is notified

And you she inquired in a strange voice

Duane kept silence

What will you do she went on

Jennie Ill go back to the brakes I darent show my face among
respectable people Im an outlaw

Youre no criminal she declared with deep passion

Jennie on this border the little difference between an out law and a
criminal doesnt count for much

You wont go back among those terrible men You with your gentleness
and sweetnessall thats good about you Oh Duane dontdont go

I cant go back to the outlaws at least not Blands band No Ill go
alone Ill lonewolf it as they say on the border What else can I do
Jennie

Oh I dont know Couldnt you hide Couldnt you slip out of Texasgo
far away

I could never get out of Texas without being arrested I could hide
but a man must live Never mind about me Jennie

In three days Duane was able with great difficulty to mount his horse
During daylight by short relays he and Jennie rode back to the main
trail where they hid again till he had rested Then in the dark they
rode out of the canons and gullies of the Rim Rock and early in the
morning halted at the first water to camp

From that point they traveled after nightfall and went into hiding
during the day Once across the Nueces River Duane was assured of
safety for her and great danger for himself They had crossed into
a country he did not know Somewhere east of the river there were
scattered ranches But he was as liable to find the rancher in touch
with the outlaws as he was likely to find him honest Duane hoped his
good fortune would not desert him in this last service to Jennie Next
to the worry of that was realization of his condition He had gotten
up too soon he had ridden too far and hard and now he felt that any
moment he might fall from his saddle At last far ahead over a barren
mesquitedotted stretch of dusty ground he espied a patch of green and
a little flat red ranchhouse He headed his horse for it and turned a
face he tried to make cheerful for Jennies sake She seemed both happy
and sorry

When near at hand he saw that the rancher was a thrifty farmer And
thrift spoke for honesty There were fields of alfalfa fruittrees
corrals windmill pumps irrigationditches all surrounding a neat
little adobe house Some children were playing in the yard The way
they ran at sight of Duane hinted of both the loneliness and the fear
of their isolated lives Duane saw a woman come to the door then a man
The latter looked keenly then stepped outside He was a sandyhaired
freckled Texan

Howdy stranger he called as Duane halted Get down you an your
woman Say now air you sick or shot or what Let me

Duane reeling in his saddle bent searching eyes upon the rancher He
thought he saw good will kindness honesty He risked all on that one
sharp glance Then he almost plunged from the saddle

The rancher caught him helped him to a bench

Martha come out here he called This mans sick No hes shot or
I dont know bloodstains

Jennie had slipped off her horse and to Duanes side Duane appeared
about to faint

Air you his wife asked the rancher

No Im only a girl he saved from outlaws Oh hes so paler Duane
Duane

Buck Duane exclaimed the rancher excitedly The man who killed
Bland an Alloway Say I owe him a good turn an Ill pay it young
woman

The ranchers wife came out and with a manner at once kind and
practical essayed to make Duane drink from a flask He was not so far
gone that he could not recognize its contents which he refused and
weakly asked for water When that was given him he found his voice

Yes Im Duane Ive only overdone myselfjust all in The wounds I
got at Blands are healing Will you take this girl inhide her awhile
till the excitements over among the outlaws

I shore will replied the Texan

Thanks Ill remember youIll square it

What re you goin to do

Ill rest a bitthen go back to the brakes

Young man you aint in any shape to travel See hereany rustlers on
your trail

I think we gave Blands gang the slip

Good Ill tell you what Ill take you in along with the girl an
hide both of you till you get well Itll be safe My nearest neighbor
is five miles off We dont have much company

You risk a great deal Both outlaws and rangers are hunting me said
Duane

Never seen a ranger yet in these parts An have always got along with
outlaws mebbe exceptin Bland I tell you I owe you a good turn

My horses might betray you added Duane

Ill hide them in a place where theres water an grass Nobody goes to
it Come now let me help you indoors

Duanes last fading sensations of that hard day were the strange feel of
a bed a relief at the removal of his heavy boots and of Jennies soft
cool hands on his hot face

He lay ill for three weeks before he began to mend and it was another
week then before he could walk out a little in the dusk of the evenings
After that his strength returned rapidly And it was only at the end
of this long siege that he recovered his spirits During most of his
illness he had been silent moody

Jennie Ill be riding off soon he said one evening I cant impose
on this good man Andrews much longer Ill never forget his kindness
His wife tooshes been so good to us Yes Jennie you and I will
have to say goodby very soon

Dont hurry away she replied

Lately Jennie had appeared strange to him She had changed from the
girl he used to see at Mrs Blands house He took her reluctance to say
goodby as another indication of her regret that he must go back to the
brakes Yet somehow it made him observe her more closely She wore a
plain white dress made from material Mrs Andrews had given her Sleep
and good food had improved her If she had been pretty out there in the
outlaw den now she was more than that But she had the same paleness
the same strained look the same dark eyes full of haunting shadows
After Duanes realization of the change in her he watched her more with
a growing certainty that he would be sorry not to see her again

Its likely we wont ever see each other again he said Thats
strange to think of Weve been through some hard days and I seem to
have known you a long time

Jennie appeared shy almost sad so Duane changed the subject to
something less personal

Andrews returned one evening from a several days trip to Huntsville

Duane everybodys talkie about how you cleaned up the Bland outfit
he said important and full of news Its some exaggerated accordin
to what you told me but youve shore made friends on this side of the
Nueces I reckon there aint a town where you wouldnt find people to
welcome you Huntsville you know is some divided in its ideas Half
the people are crooked Likely enough all them who was so loud in
praise of you are the crookedest For instance I met King Fisher the
boss outlaw of these parts Well King thinks hes a decent citizen
He was tellin me what a grand job yours was for the border an honest
cattlemen Now that Bland and Alloway are done for King Fisher will
find rustlin easier Theres talk of Hardin movie his camp over to
Blands But I dont know how true it is I reckon there aint much
to it In the past when a big outlaw chief went under his band almost
always broke up an scattered Theres no one left who could run thet
outfit

Did you hear of any outlaws hunting me asked Duane

Nobody from Blands outfit is huntin you thets shore replied
Andrews Fisher said there never was a hoss straddled to go on your
trail Nobody had any use for Bland Anyhow his men would be afraid to
trail you An you could go right in to Huntsville where youd be some
popular Reckon youd be safe too except when some of them fool saloon
loafers or bad cowpunchers would try to shoot you for the glory in it
Them kind of men will bob up everywhere you go Duane

Ill be able to ride and take care of myself in a day or two went on
Duane Then Ill goId like to talk to you about Jennie

Shes welcome to a home here with us

Thank you Andrews Youre a kind man But I want Jennie to get farther
away from the Rio Grande Shed never be safe here Besides she may be
able to find relatives She has some though she doesnt know where they
are

All right Duane Whatever you think best I reckon now youd better
take her to some town Go north an strike for Shelbyville or Crockett
Thems both good towns Ill tell Jennie the names of men wholl help
her You neednt ride into town at all

Which place is nearer and how far is it

Shelbyville I reckon about two days ride Poor stock country so you
aint liable to meet rustlers All the same better hit the trail at
night an go careful

At sunset two days later Duane and Jennie mounted their horses and said
goodby to the rancher and his wife Andrews would not listen to Duanes
thanks

I tell you Im beholden to you yet he declared

Well what can I do for you asked Duane I may come along here again
some day

Get down an come in then or youre no friend of mine I reckon there
aint nothin I can think ofI just happen to remember Here he led
Duane out of earshot of the women and went on in a whisper Buck I
used to be welltodo Got skinned by a man named BrownRodney Brown
He lives in Huntsville an hes my enemy I never was much on fightin
or Id fixed him Brown ruined mestole all I had Hes a hoss an
cattle thief an he has pull enough at home to protect him I reckon I
neednt say any more

Is this Brown a man who shot an outlaw named Stevens queried Duane
curiously

Shore hes the same I heard thet story Brown swears he plugged
Stevens through the middle But the outlaw rode off an nobody ever
knew for shore

Luke Stevens died of that shot I buried him said Duane

Andrews made no further comment and the two men returned to the women

The main road for about three miles then where it forks take the
lefthand road and keep on straight That what you said Andrews

Shore An good luck to you both

Duane and Jennie trotted away into the gathering twilight At the moment
an insistent thought bothered Duane Both Luke Stevens and the rancher
Andrews had hinted to Duane to kill a man named Brown Duane wished
with all his heart that they had not mentioned it let alone taken for
granted the execution of the deed What a bloody place Texas was Men
who robbed and men who were robbed both wanted murder It was in the
spirit of the country Duane certainly meant to avoid ever meeting this
Rodney Brown And that very determination showed Duane how dangerous
he really wasto men and to himself Sometimes he had a feeling of how
little stood between his sane and better self and a self utterly wild
and terrible He reasoned that only intelligence could save himonly a
thoughtful understanding of his danger and a hold upon some ideal

Then he fell into low conversation with Jennie holding out hopeful
views of her future and presently darkness set in The sky was overcast
with heavy clouds there was no air moving the heat and oppression
threatened storm By and by Duane could not see a rod in front of him
though his horse had no difficulty in keeping to the road Duane was
bothered by the blackness of the night Traveling fast was impossible
and any moment he might miss the road that led off to the left So
he was compelled to give all his attention to peering into the thick
shadows ahead As good luck would have it he came to higher ground
where there was less mesquite and therefore not such impenetrable
darkness and at this point he came to where the road split

Once headed in the right direction he felt easier in mind To his
annoyance however a fine misty rain set in Jennie was not well
dressed for wet weather and for that matter neither was he His coat
which in that dry warm climate he seldom needed was tied behind his
saddle and he put it on Jennie

They traveled on The rain fell steadily if anything growing thicker
Duane grew uncomfortably wet and chilly Jennie however fared somewhat
better by reason of the heavy coat The night passed quickly despite the
discomfort and soon a gray dismal rainy dawn greeted the travelers

Jennie insisted that he find some shelter where a fire could be built to
dry his clothes He was not in a fit condition to risk catching cold
In fact Duanes teeth were chattering To find a shelter in that barren
waste seemed a futile task Quite unexpectedly however they happened
upon a deserted adobe cabin situated a little off the road Not only did
it prove to have a dry interior but also there was firewood Water
was available in pools everywhere however there was no grass for the
horses

A good fire and hot food and drink changed the aspect of their condition
as far as comfort went And Jennie lay down to sleep For Duane
however there must be vigilance This cabin was no hidingplace The
rain fell harder all the time and the wind changed to the north Its
a norther all right muttered Duane Two or three days And he felt
that his extraordinary luck had not held out Still one point favored
him and it was that travelers were not likely to come along during the
storm Jennie slept while Duane watched The saving of this girl meant
more to him than any task he had ever assumed First it had been partly
from a human feeling to succor an unfortunate woman and partly a motive
to establish clearly to himself that he was no outlaw Lately however
had come a different sense a strange one with something personal and
warm and protective in it

As he looked down upon her a slight slender girl with bedraggled dress
and disheveled hair her face pale and quiet a little stern in sleep
and her long dark lashes lying on her cheek he seemed to see her
fragility her prettiness her femininity as never before But for him
she might at that very moment have been a broken ruined girl lying
back in that cabin of the Blands The fact gave him a feeling of his
importance in this shifting of her destiny She was unharmed still
young she would forget and be happy she would live to be a good
wife and mother Somehow the thought swelled his heart His act
deathdealing as it had been was a noble one and helped him to hold
on to his drifting hopes Hardly once since Jennie had entered into his
thought had those ghosts returned to torment him

Tomorrow she would be gone among good kind people with a possibility
of finding her relatives He thanked God for that nevertheless he felt
a pang

She slept more than half the day Duane kept guard always alert
whether he was sitting standing or walking The rain pattered steadily
on the roof and sometimes came in gusty flurries through the door
The horses were outside in a shed that afforded poor shelter and they
stamped restlessly Duane kept them saddled and bridled

About the middle of the afternoon Jennie awoke They cooked a meal
and afterward sat beside the little fire She had never been in his
observation of her anything but a tragic figure an unhappy girl the
farthest removed from serenity and poise That characteristic capacity
for agitation struck him as stronger in her this day He attributed it
however to the long strain the suspense nearing an end Yet sometimes
when her eyes were on him she did not seem to be thinking of her
freedom of her future

This time tomorrow youll be in Shelbyville he said

Where will you be she asked quickly

Me Oh Ill be making tracks for some lonesome place he replied

The girl shuddered

Ive been brought up in Texas I remember what a hard lot the men of my
family had But poor as they were they had a roof over their heads
a hearth with a fire a warm bedsomebody to love them And you
Duaneoh my God What must your life be You must ride and hide and
watch eternally No decent food no pillow no friendly word no clean
clothes no womans hand Horses guns trails rocks holesthese must
be the important things in your life You must go on riding hiding
killing until you meet

She ended with a sob and dropped her head on her knees Duane was
amazed deeply touched

My girl thank you for that thought of me he said with a tremor in
his voice You dont know how much that means to me

She raised her face and it was tearstained eloquent beautiful

Ive heard tellthe best of men go to the bad out there You wont
Promise me you wont I neverknew any manlike you IIwe may
never see each other againafter today Ill never forget you Ill
pray for you and Ill never give up trying toto do something Dont
despair Its never too late It was my hope that kept me aliveout
there at Blandsbefore you came I was only a poor weak girl But if
I could hopeso can you Stay away from men Be a lone wolf Fight for
your life Stick out your exileand maybesome day

Then she lost her voice Duane clasped her hand and with feeling as deep
as hers promised to remember her words In her despair for him she had
spoken wisdompointed out the only course

Duanes vigilance momentarily broken by emotion had no sooner
reasserted itself than he discovered the bay horse the one Jennie rode
had broken his halter and gone off The soft wet earth had deadened the
sound of his hoofs His tracks were plain in the mud There were clumps
of mesquite in sight among which the horse might have strayed It
turned out however that he had not done so

Duane did not want to leave Jennie alone in the cabin so near the road
So he put her up on his horse and bade her follow The rain had ceased
for the time being though evidently the storm was not yet over The
tracks led up a wash to a wide flat where mesquite prickly pear and
thornbush grew so thickly that Jennie could not ride into it Duane was
thoroughly concerned He must have her horse Time was flying It would
soon be night He could not expect her to scramble quickly through that
brake on foot Therefore he decided to risk leaving her at the edge of
the thicket and go in alone

As he went in a sound startled him Was it the breaking of a branch
he had stepped on or thrust aside He heard the impatient pound of
his horses hoofs Then all was quiet Still he listened not wholly
satisfied He was never satisfied in regard to safety he knew too well
that there never could be safety for him in this country

The bay horse had threaded the aisles of the thicket Duane wondered
what had drawn him there Certainly it had not been grass for there was
none Presently he heard the horse tramping along and then he ran The
mud was deep and the sharp thorns made going difficult He came up
with the horse and at the same moment crossed a multitude of fresh
horsetracks

He bent lower to examine them and was alarmed to find that they had
been made very recently even since it had ceased raining They were
tracks of wellshod horses Duane straightened up with a cautious glance
all around His instant decision was to hurry back to Jennie But he
had come a goodly way through the thicket and it was impossible to rush
back Once or twice he imagined he heard crashings in the brush but
did not halt to make sure Certain he was now that some kind of danger
threatened

Suddenly there came an unmistakable thump of horses hoofs off somewhere
to the fore Then a scream rent the air It ended abruptly Duane leaped
forward tore his way through the thorny brake He heard Jennie cry
againan appealing call quickly hushed It seemed more to his right
and he plunged that way He burst into a glade where a smoldering fire
and ground covered with footprints and tracks showed that campers had
lately been Rushing across this he broke his passage out to the open
But he was too late His horse had disappeared Jennie was gone There
were no riders in sight There was no sound There was a heavy trail of
horses going north Jennie had been carried offprobably by outlaws
Duane realized that pursuit was out of the questionthat Jennie was
lost



CHAPTER X

A hundred miles from the haunts most familiar with Duanes deeds far
up where the Nueces ran a trickling clear stream between yellow cliffs
stood a small deserted shack of covered mesquite poles It had been made
long ago but was well preserved A door faced the overgrown trail
and another faced down into a gorge of dense thickets On the border
fugitives from law and men who hid in fear of some one they had wronged
never lived in houses with only one door

It was a wild spot lonely not fit for human habitation except for the
outcast He perhaps might have found it hard to leave for most of the
other wild nooks in that barren country Down in the gorge there
was neverfailing sweet water grass all the year round cool shady
retreats deer rabbits turkeys fruit and miles and miles of
narrowtwisting deep canon full of broken rocks and impenetrable
thickets The scream of the panther was heard there the squall of the
wildcat the cough of the jaguar Innumerable bees buzzed in the spring
blossoms and it seemed scattered honey to the winds All day there
was continuous song of birds that of the mockingbird loud and sweet
and mocking above the rest

On clear daysand rare indeed were cloudy dayswith the subsiding
of the wind at sunset a hush seemed to fall around the little hut
Fardistant dimblue mountains stood goldrimmed gradually to fade with
the shading of light

At this quiet hour a man climbed up out of the gorge and sat in the
westward door of the hut This lonely watcher of the west and listener
to the silence was Duane And this hut was the one where three years
before Jennie had nursed him back to life

The killing of a man named Sellers and the combination of circumstances
that had made the tragedy a memorable regret had marked if not a
change at least a cessation in Duanes activities He had trailed
Sellers to kill him for the supposed abducting of Jennie He had trailed
him long after he had learned Sellers traveled alone Duane wanted
absolute assurance of Jennies death Vague rumors a few words here and
there unauthenticated stories were all Duane had gathered in years to
substantiate his beliefthat Jennie died shortly after the beginning of
her second captivity But Duane did not know surely Sellers might have
told him Duane expected if not to force it from him at the end to
read it in his eyes But the bullet went too unerringly it locked his
lips and fixed his eyes

After that meeting Duane lay long at the ranchhouse of a friend and
when he recovered from the wound Sellers had given him he started with
two horses and a pack for the lonely gorge on the Nueces There he
had been hidden for months a prey to remorse a dreamer a victim of
phantoms

It took work for him to find subsistence in that rocky fastness And
work action helped to pass the hours But he could not work all the
time even if he had found it to do Then in his idle moments and at
night his task was to live with the hell in his mind

The sunset and the twilight hour made all the rest bearable The little
hut on the rim of the gorge seemed to hold Jennies presence It was not
as if he felt her spirit If it had been he would have been sure of her
death He hoped Jennie had not survived her second misfortune and that
intense hope had burned into belief if not surety Upon his return to
that locality on the occasion of his first visit to the hut he had
found things just as they had left them and a poor faded piece of
ribbon Jennie had used to tie around her bright hair No wandering
outlaw or traveler had happened upon the lonely spot which further
endeared it to Duane

A strange feature of this memory of Jennie was the freshness of itthe
failure of years toil strife deathdealing to dim itto deaden
the thought of what might have been He had a marvelous gift of
visualization He could shut his eyes and see Jennie before him just as
clearly as if she had stood there in the flesh For hours he did that
dreaming dreaming of life he had never tasted and now never would
taste He saw Jennies slender graceful figure the old brown ragged
dress in which he had seen her first at Blands her little feet in
Mexican sandals her fine hands coarsened by work her round arms and
swelling throat and her pale sad beautiful face with its staring dark
eyes He remembered every look she had given him every word she had
spoken to him every time she had touched him He thought of her beauty
and sweetness of the few things which had come to mean to him that
she must have loved him and he trained himself to think of these in
preference to her life at Blands the escape with him and then her
recapture because such memories led to bitter fruitless pain He had
to fight suffering because it was eating out his heart

Sitting there eyes wide open he dreamed of the old homestead and his
whitehaired mother He saw the old home life sweetened and filled by
dear new faces and added joys go on before his eyes with him a part of
it

Then in the inevitable reaction in the reflux of bitter reality he
would send out a voiceless cry no less poignant because it was silent
Poor fool No I shall never see mother againnever go homenever
have a home I am Duane the Lone Wolf Oh God I wish it were over
These dreams torture me What have I to do with a mother a home a
wife No brighthaired boy no darkeyed girl will ever love me I am
an outlaw an outcast dead to the good and decent world I am
alonealone Better be a callous brute or better dead I shall go mad
thinking Man what is left to you A hidingplace like a wolfslonely
silent days lonely nights with phantoms Or the trail and the road with
their bloody tracks and then the hard ride the sleepless hungry ride
to some hole in rocks or brakes What hellish thing drives me Why cant
I end it all What is left Only that damned unquenchable spirit of the
gunfighter to liveto hang on to miserable lifeto have no fear of
death yet to cling like a leachto die as gunfighters seldom die
with boots off Bain you were first and youre long avenged Id
change with you And Sellers you were last and youre avenged And you
othersyoure avenged Lie quiet in your graves and give me peace

But they did not lie quiet in their graves and give him peace

A group of specters trooped out of the shadows of dusk and gathering
round him escorted him to his bed

When Duane had been riding the trails passionbent to escape pursuers
or passionbent in his search the constant action and toil and
exhaustion made him sleep But when in hiding as time passed gradually
he required less rest and sleep and his mind became more active Little
by little his phantoms gained hold on him and at length but for the
saving power of his dreams they would have claimed him utterly

How many times he had said to himself I am an intelligent man Im
not crazy Im in full possession of my faculties All this is
fancyimaginationconscience Ive no work no duty no ideal no
hopeand my mind is obsessed thronged with images And these images
naturally are of the men with whom I have dealt I cant forget them
They come back to me hour after hour and when my tortured mind grows
weak then maybe Im not just right till the mood wears out and lets me
sleep

So he reasoned as he lay down in his comfortable camp The night was
starbright above the canonwalls darkly shadowing down between them
The insects hummed and chirped and thrummed a continuous thick song low
and monotonous Slowrunning water splashed softly over stones in the
streambed From far down the canon came the mournful hoot of an owl
The moment he lay down thereby giving up action for the day all these
things weighed upon him like a great heavy mantle of loneliness In
truth they did not constitute loneliness

And he could no more have dispelled thought than he could have reached
out to touch a cold bright star

He wondered how many outcasts like him lay under this starstudded
velvety sky across the fifteen hundred miles of wild country between
El Paso and the mouth of the river A vast wild territorya refuge for
outlaws Somewhere he had heard or read that the Texas Rangers kept a
book with names and records of outlawsthree thousand known outlaws
Yet these could scarcely be half of that unfortunate horde which had
been recruited from all over the states Duane had traveled from camp to
camp den to den hidingplace to hidingplace and he knew these men
Most of them were hopeless criminals some were avengers a few were
wronged wanderers and among them occasionally was a man human in his
way honest as he could be not yet lost to good

But all of them were akin in one sensetheir outlawry and that starry
night they lay with their dark faces up some in packs like wolves
others alone like the gray wolf who knew no mate It did not make much
difference in Duanes thought of them that the majority were steeped in
crime and brutality more often than not stupid from rum incapable of a
fine feeling just lost wild dogs

Duane doubted that there was a man among them who did not realize his
moral wreck and ruin He had met poor half witted wretches who knew it
He believed he could enter into their minds and feel the truth of
all their livesthe hardened outlaw coarse ignorant bestial who
murdered as Bill Black had murdered who stole for the sake of stealing
who craved money to gamble and drink defiantly ready for death and
like that terrible outlaw Helm who cried out on the scaffold Let her
rip

The wild youngsters seeking notoriety and reckless adventure the
cowboys with a notch on their guns with boastful pride in the knowledge
that they were marked by rangers the crooked men from the North
defaulters forgers murderers all palefaced flatchested men not fit
for that wilderness and not surviving the dishonest cattlemen hand
and glove with outlaws driven from their homes the old grizzled
bowlegged genuine rustlersall these Duane had come in contact with
had watched and known and as he felt with them he seemed to see that as
their lives were bad sooner or later to end dismally or tragically so
they must pay some kind of earthly penaltyif not of conscience then
of fear if not of fear then of that most terrible of all things to
restless active menpain the pang of flesh and bone

Duane knew for he had seen them pay Best of all moreover he knew the
internal life of the gunfighter of that select but by no means small
class of which he was representative The world that judged him and his
kind judged him as a machine a killingmachine with only mind enough
to hunt to meet to slay another man It had taken three endless years
for Duane to understand his own father Duane knew beyond all doubt that
the gunfighters like Bland like Alloway like Sellers men who were
evil and had no remorse no spiritual accusing Nemesis had something
far more torturing to mind more haunting more murderous of rest and
sleep and peace and that something was abnormal fear of death Duane
knew this for he had shot these men he had seen the quick dark shadow
in eyes the presentiment that the will could not control and then the
horrible certainty These men must have been in agony at every meeting
with a possible or certain foemore agony than the hot rend of a
bullet They were haunted too haunted by this fear by every victim
calling from the grave that nothing was so inevitable as death which
lurked behind every corner hid in every shadow lay deep in the dark
tube of every gun These men could not have a friend they could not
love or trust a woman They knew their one chance of holding on to life
lay in their own distrust watchfulness dexterity and that hope by
the very nature of their lives could not be lasting They had doomed
themselves What then could possibly have dwelt in the depths of
their minds as they went to their beds on a starry night like this with
mystery in silence and shadow with time passing surely and the dark
future and its secret approaching every hourwhat then but hell

The hell in Duanes mind was not fear of man or fear of death He would
have been glad to lay down the burden of life providing death came
naturally Many times he had prayed for it But that overdeveloped
superhuman spirit of defense in him precluded suicide or the inviting of
an enemys bullet Sometimes he had a vague scarcely analyzed idea that
this spirit was what had made the Southwest habitable for the white man

Every one of his victims singly and collectively returned to him for
ever it seemed in cold passionless accusing domination of these
haunted hours They did not accuse him of dishonor or cowardice or
brutality or murder they only accused him of Death It was as if they
knew more than when they were alive had learned that life was a divine
mysterious gift not to be taken They thronged about him with their
voiceless clamoring drifted around him with their fading eyes



CHAPTER XI

After nearly six months in the Nueces gorge the loneliness and inaction
of his life drove Duane out upon the trails seeking anything rather than
to hide longer alone a prey to the scourge of his thoughts The moment
he rode into sight of men a remarkable transformation occurred in him A
strange warmth stirred in hima longing to see the faces of people
to hear their voicesa pleasurable emotion sad and strange But it was
only a precursor of his old bitter sleepless and eternal vigilance
When he hid alone in the brakes he was safe from all except his deeper
better self when he escaped from this into the haunts of men his force
and will went to the preservation of his life

Mercer was the first village he rode into He had many friends there
Mercer claimed to owe Duane a debt On the outskirts of the village
there was a grave overgrown by brush so that the rudelettered post
which marked it was scarcely visible to Duane as he rode by He had
never read the inscription But he thought now of Hardin no other than
the erstwhile ally of Bland For many years Hardin had harassed the
stockmen and ranchers in and around Mercer On an evil day for him he
or his outlaws had beaten and robbed a man who once succored Duane
when sore in need Duane met Hardin in the little plaza of the village
called him every name known to border men taunted him to draw and
killed him in the act

Duane went to the house of one Jones a Texan who had known his father
and there he was warmly received The feel of an honest hand the voice
of a friend the prattle of children who were not afraid of him or his
gun good wholesome food and change of clothesthese things for the
time being made a changed man of Duane To be sure he did not often
speak The price of his head and the weight of his burden made him
silent But eagerly he drank in all the news that was told him In
the years of his absence from home he had never heard a word about his
mother or uncle Those who were his real friends on the border would
have been the last to make inquiries to write or receive letters that
might give a clue to Duanes whereabouts

Duane remained all day with this hospitable Jones and as twilight
fell was loath to go and yielded to a pressing invitation to remain
overnight It was seldom indeed that Duane slept under a roof Early
in the evening while Duane sat on the porch with two awed and
heroworshiping sons of the house Jones returned from a quick visit
down to the postoffice Summarily he sent the boys off He labored
under intense excitement

Duane theres rangers in town he whispered Its all over town
too that youre here You rode in long after sunup Lots of people saw
you I dont believe theres a man or boy that d squeal on you But the
women might They gossip and these rangers are handsome fellowsdevils
with the women

What company of rangers asked Duane quickly

Company A under Captain MacNelly that new ranger He made a big name
in the war And since hes been in the ranger service hes done wonders
Hes cleaned up some bad places south and hes working north

MacNelly Ive heard of him Describe him to me

Slightbuilt chap but wiry and tough Clean face black mustache and
hair Sharp black eyes Hes got a look of authority MacNellys a fine
man Duane Belongs to a good Southern family Id hate to have him look
you up

Duane did not speak

MacNellys got nerve and his rangers are all experienced men If they
find out youre here theyll come after you MacNellys no gunfighter
but he wouldnt hesitate to do his duty even if he faced sure death
Which he would in this case Duane you mustnt meet Captain MacNelly
Your record is clean if it is terrible You never met a ranger or any
officer except a rotten sheriff now and then like Rod Brown

Still Duane kept silence He was not thinking of danger but of the fact
of how fleeting must be his stay among friends

Ive already fixed up a pack of grub went on Jones Ill slip out to
saddle your horse You watch here

He had scarcely uttered the last word when soft swift footsteps sounded
on the hard path A man turned in at the gate The light was dim yet
clean enough to disclose an unusually tall figure When it appeared
nearer he was seen to be walking with both arms raised hands high He
slowed his stride

Does Burt Jones live here he asked in a low hurried voice

I reckon Im Burt What can I do for you replied Jones

The stranger peered around stealthily came closer still with his hands
up

It is known that Buck Duane is here Captain MacNellys camping on the
river just out of town He sends word to Duane to come out there after
dark

The stranger wheeled and departed as swiftly and strangely as he had
come

Bust me Duane whatever do you make of that exclaimed Jones

A new one on me replied Duane thoughtfully

First fool thing I ever heard of MacNelly doing Cant make head nor
tails of it Id have said offhand that MacNelly wouldnt doublecross
anybody He struck me as a square man sand all through But hell he
must mean treachery I cant see anything else in that deal

Maybe the Captain wants to give me a fair chance to surrender without
bloodshed observed Duane Pretty decent of him if he meant that

He INVITES YOU out to his camp AFTER DARK Something strange about
this Duane But MacNellys a new man out here He does some queer
things Perhaps hes getting a swelled head Well whatever his
intentions his presence around Mercer is enough for us Duane you
hit the road and put some miles between you the amiable Captain before
daylight Tomorrow Ill go out there and ask him what in the devil he
meant

That messenger he senthe was a ranger said Duane

Sure he was and a nervy one It must have taken sand to come bracing
you that way Duane the fellow didnt pack a gun Ill swear to that
Pretty odd this trick But you cant trust it Hit the road Duane

A little later a black horse with muffled hoofs bearing a tall dark
rider who peered keenly into every shadow trotted down a pasture lane
back of Joness house turned into the road and then breaking into
swifter gait rapidly left Mercer behind

Fifteen or twenty miles out Duane drew rein in a forest of mesquite
dismounted and searched about for a glade with a little grass Here he
staked his horse on a long lariat and using his saddle for a pillow
his saddleblanket for covering he went to sleep

Next morning he was off again working south During the next few days
he paid brief visits to several villages that lay in his path And in
each some one particular friend had a piece of news to impart that made
Duane profoundly thoughtful A ranger had made a quiet unobtrusive call
upon these friends and left this message Tell Buck Duane to ride into
Captain MacNellys camp some time after night

Duane concluded and his friends all agreed with him that the new
rangers main purpose in the Nueces country was to capture or kill Buck
Duane and that this message was simply an original and striking ruse
the daring of which might appeal to certain outlaws

But it did not appeal to Duane His curiosity was aroused it did not
however tempt him to any foolhardy act He turned southwest and rode a
hundred miles until he again reached the sparsely settled country Here
he heard no more of rangers It was a barren region he had never but
once ridden through and that ride had cost him dear He had been
compelled to shoot his way out Outlaws were not in accord with the
few ranchers and their cowboys who ranged there He learned that both
outlaws and Mexican raiders had long been at bitter enmity with these
ranchers Being unfamiliar with roads and trails Duane had pushed on
into the heart of this district when all the time he really believed he
was traveling around it A rifleshot from a ranchhouse a deliberate
attempt to kill him because he was an unknown rider in those parts
discovered to Duane his mistake and a hard ride to get away persuaded
him to return to his old methods of hiding by day and traveling by
night

He got into rough country rode for three days without covering much
ground but believed that he was getting on safer territory Twice he
came to a wide bottomland green with willow and cottonwood and thick as
chaparral somewhere through the middle of which ran a river he decided
must be the lower Nueces

One evening as he stole out from a covert where he had camped he saw
the lights of a village He tried to pass it on the left but was unable
to because the brakes of this bottomland extended in almost to the
outskirts of the village and he had to retrace his steps and go round
to the right Wire fences and horses in pasture made this a task so it
was well after midnight before he accomplished it He made ten miles or
more then by daylight and after that proceeded cautiously along a road
which appeared to be well worn from travel He passed several thickets
where he would have halted to hide during the day but for the fact that
he had to find water

He was a long while in coming to it and then there was no thicket or
clump of mesquite near the waterhole that would afford him covert So he
kept on

The country before him was ridgy and began to show cottonwoods here and
there in the hollows and yucca and mesquite on the higher ground As he
mounted a ridge he noted that the road made a sharp turn and he could
not see what was beyond it He slowed up and was making the turn which
was downhill between high banks of yellow clay when his mettlesome
horse heard something to frighten him or shied at something and bolted

The few bounds he took before Duanes iron arm checked him were enough
to reach the curve One flashing glance showed Duane the open once more
a little valley below with a wide shallow rocky stream a clump of
cottonwoods beyond a somber group of men facing him and two dark
limp strangely grotesque figures hanging from branches

The sight was common enough in southwest Texas but Duane had never
before found himself so unpleasantly close

A hoarse voice pealed out By hell theres another one

Stranger ride down an account fer yourself yelled another

Hands up

Thets right Jack dont take no chances Plug him

These remarks were so swiftly uttered as almost to be continuous Duane
was wheeling his horse when a rifle cracked The bullet struck his left
forearm and he thought broke it for he dropped the rein The frightened
horse leaped Another bullet whistled past Duane Then the bend in the
road saved him probably from certain death Like the wind his fleet
steed wend down the long hill

Duane was in no hurry to look back He knew what to expect His chief
concern of the moment was for his injured arm He found that the bones
were still intact but the wound having been made by a soft bullet was
an exceedingly bad one Blood poured from it Giving the horse his head
Duane wound his scarf tightly round the holes and with teeth and hand
tied it tightly That done he looked back over his shoulder

Riders were making the dust fly on the hillside road There were more
coming round the cut where the road curved The leader was perhaps a
quarter of a mile back and the others strung out behind him Duane
needed only one glance to tell him that they were fast and hardriding
cowboys in a land where all riders were good They would not have owned
any but strong swift horses Moreover it was a district where ranchers
had suffered beyond all endurance the greed and brutality of outlaws
Duane had simply been so unfortunate as to run right into a lynching
party at a time of all times when any stranger would be in danger and
any outlaw put to his limit to escape with his life

Duane did not look back again till he had crossed the ridgy piece
of ground and had gotten to the level road He had gained upon his
pursuers When he ascertained this he tried to save his horse to check
a little that killing gait This horse was a magnificent animal big
strong fast but his endurance had never been put to a grueling test
And that worried Duane His life had made it impossible to keep one
horse very long at a time and this one was an unknown quantity

Duane had only one planthe only plan possible in this caseand that
was to make the riverbottoms where he might elude his pursuers in the
willow brakes Fifteen miles or so would bring him to the river and
this was not a hopeless distance for any good horse if not too closely
pressed Duane concluded presently that the cowboys behind were losing a
little in the chase because they were not extending their horses It was
decidedly unusual for such riders to save their mounts Duane pondered
over this looking backward several times to see if their horses were
stretched out They were not and the fact was disturbing Only one
reason presented itself to Duanes conjecturing and it was that with
him headed straight on that road his pursuers were satisfied not to
force the running He began to hope and look for a trail or a road
turning off to right or left There was none A rough mesquitedotted
and yuccaspired country extended away on either side Duane believed
that he would be compelled to take to this hard going One thing was
certainhe had to go round the village The river however was on the
outskirts of the village and once in the willows he would be safe

Dustclouds far ahead caused his alarm to grow He watched with his eyes
strained he hoped to see a wagon a few stray cattle But no he soon
descried several horsemen Shots and yells behind him attested to the
fact that his pursuers likewise had seen these newcomers on the scene
More than a mile separated these two parties yet that distance did not
keep them from soon understanding each other Duane waited only to see
this new factor show signs of sudden quick action and then with a
muttered curse he spurred his horse off the road into the brush

He chose the right side because the river lay nearer that way There
were patches of open sandy ground between clumps of cactus and mesquite
and he found that despite a zigzag course he made better time It was
impossible for him to locate his pursuers They would come together he
decided and take to his tracks

What then was his surprise and dismay to run out of a thicket right
into a low ridge of rough broken rock impossible to get a horse over
He wheeled to the left along its base The sandy ground gave place to
a harder soil where his horse did not labor so Here the growths of
mesquite and cactus became scanter affording better travel but poor
cover He kept sharp eyes ahead and as he had expected soon saw
moving dustclouds and the dark figures of horses They were half a mile
away and swinging obliquely across the flat which fact proved that
they had entertained a fair idea of the country and the fugitives
difficulty

Without an instants hesitation Duane put his horse to his best efforts
straight ahead He had to pass those men When this was seemingly made
impossible by a deep wash from which he had to turn Duane began to feel
cold and sick Was this the end Always there had to be an end to an
outlaws career He wanted then to ride straight at these pursuers But
reason outweighed instinct He was fleeing for his life nevertheless
the strongest instinct at the time was his desire to fight

He knew when these three horsemen saw him and a moment afterward he
lost sight of them as he got into the mesquite again He meant now
to try to reach the road and pushed his mount severely though still
saving him for a final burst Rocks thickets bunches of cactus
washesall operated against his following a straight line Almost he
lost his bearings and finally would have ridden toward his enemies
had not good fortune favored him in the matter of an open burnedover
stretch of ground

Here he saw both groups of pursuers one on each side and almost within
gunshot Their sharp yells as much as his cruel spurs drove his horse
into that pace which now meant life or death for him And never had
Duane bestrode a gamer swifter stancher beast He seemed about to
accomplish the impossible In the dragging sand he was far superior to
any horse in pursuit and on this sandy open stretch he gained enough
to spare a little in the brush beyond Heated now and thoroughly
terrorized he kept the pace through thickets that almost tore Duane
from his saddle Something weighty and grim eased off Duane He was
going to get out in front The horse had speed fire stamina

Duane dashed out into another open place dotted by few trees and here
right in his path within pistolrange stood horsemen waiting They
yelled they spurred toward him but did not fire at him He turned his
horsefaced to the right Only one thing kept him from standing his
ground to fight it out He remembered those dangling limp figures
hanging from the cottonwoods These ranchers would rather hang an outlaw
than do anything They might draw all his fire and then capture him His
horror of hanging was so great as to be all out of proportion compared
to his gunfighters instinct of selfpreservation

A race began then a dusty crashing drive through gray mesquite Duane
could scarcely see he was so blinded by stinging branches across his
eyes The hollow wind roared in his ears He lost his sense of the
nearness of his pursuers But they must have been close Did they
shoot at him He imagined he heard shots But that might have been
the cracking of dead snags His left arm hung limp almost useless he
handled the rein with his right and most of the time he hung low over
the pommel The gray walls flashing by him the whip of twigs the rush
of wind the heavy rapid pound of hoofs the violent motion of his
horsethese vied in sensation with the smart of sweat in his eyes the
rack of his wound the cold sick cramp in his stomach With these also
was dull raging fury He had to run when he wanted to fight It took
all his mind to force back that bitter hate of himself of his pursuers
of this race for his useless life

Suddenly he burst out of a line of mesquite into the road A long
stretch of lonely road How fiercely with hot strange joy he wheeled
his horse upon it Then he was sweeping along sure now that he was out
in front His horse still had strength and speed but showed signs of
breaking Presently Duane looked back Pursuershe could not count how
manywere loping along in his rear He paid no more attention to them
and with teeth set he faced ahead grimmer now in his determination to
foil them

He passed a few scattered ranchhouses where horses whistled from
corrals and men curiously watched him fly past He saw one rancher
running and he felt intuitively that this fellow was going to join in
the chase Duanes steed pounded on not noticeably slower but with a
lack of former smoothness with a strained convulsive jerking stride
which showed he was almost done

Sight of the village ahead surprised Duane He had reached it sooner
than he expected Then he made a discoveryhe had entered the zone of
wire fences As he dared not turn back now he kept on intending to
ride through the village Looking backward he saw that his pursuers
were half a mile distant too far to alarm any villagers in time to
intercept him in his flight As he rode by the first houses his horse
broke and began to labor Duane did not believe he would last long
enough to go through the village

Saddled horses in front of a store gave Duane an idea not by any means
new and one he had carried out successfully before As he pulled in
his heaving mount and leaped off a couple of ranchers came out of the
place and one of them stepped to a cleanlimbed fiery bay He was
about to get into his saddle when he saw Duane and then he halted a
foot in the stirrup

Duane strode forward grasped the bridle of this mans horse

Mines donebut not killed he panted Trade with me

Wal stranger Im shore always ready to trade drawled the man But
aint you a little swift

Duane glanced back up the road His pursuers were entering the village

Im DuaneBuck Duane he cried menacingly Will you trade Hurry

The rancher turning white dropped his foot from the stirrup and fell
back

I reckon Ill trade he said

Bounding up Duane dug spurs into the bays flanks The horse snorted
in fright plunged into a run He was fresh swift half wild Duane
flashed by the remaining houses on the street out into the open But the
road ended at that village or else led out from some other quarter for
he had ridden straight into the fields and from them into rough desert
When he reached the cover of mesquite once more he looked back to find
six horsemen within rifleshot of him and more coming behind them

His new horse had not had time to get warm before Duane reached a high
sandy bluff below which lay the willow brakes As far as he could see
extended an immense flat strip of redtinged willow How welcome it was
to his eye He felt like a hunted wolf that weary and lame had reached
his hole in the rocks Zigzagging down the soft slope he put the bay to
the dense wall of leaf and branch But the horse balked

There was little time to lose Dismounting he dragged the stubborn
beast into the thicket This was harder and slower work than Duane cared
to risk If he had not been rushed he might have had better success So
he had to abandon the horsea circumstance that only such sore straits
could have driven him to Then he went slipping swiftly through the
narrow aisles

He had not gotten under cover any too soon For he heard his pursuers
piling over the bluff loudvoiced confident brutal They crashed into
the willows

Hi Sid Heahs your hoss called one evidently to the man Duane had
forced into a trade

Say if you locoed gentsll hold up a little Ill tell you somethin
replied a voice from the bluff

Come on Sid We got him corralled said the first speaker

Wal mebbe an if you hev its liable to be damn hot THET FELLER WAS
BUCK DUANE

Absolute silence followed that statement Presently it was broken by a
rattling of loose gravel and then low voices

He cant git across the river I tell you came to Duanes ears Hes
corralled in the brake I know thet hole

Then Duane gliding silently and swiftly through the willows heard no
more from his pursuers He headed straight for the river Threading a
passage through a willow brake was an old task for him Many days and
nights had gone to the acquiring of a skill that might have been envied
by an Indian

The Rio Grande and its tributaries for the most of their length in Texas
ran between wide low flat lands covered by a dense growth of willow
Cottonwood mesquite prickly pear and other growths mingled with the
willow and altogether they made a matted tangled copse a thicket that
an inexperienced man would have considered impenetrable From above
these wild brakes looked green and red from the inside they were gray
and yellowa striped wall Trails and glades were scarce There were
a few deerrunways and sometimes little paths made by peccariesthe
jabali or wild pigs of Mexico The ground was clay and unusually dry
sometimes baked so hard that it left no imprint of a track Where a
growth of cottonwood had held back the encroachment of the willows there
usually was thick grass and underbrush The willows were short slender
poles with stems so close together that they almost touched and with
the leafy foliage forming a thick covering The depths of this brake
Duane had penetrated was a silent dreamy strange place In the middle
of the day the light was weird and dim When a breeze fluttered the
foliage then slender shafts and spears of sunshine pierced the green
mantle and danced like gold on the ground

Duane had always felt the strangeness of this kind of place and
likewise he had felt a protecting harboring something which always
seemed to him to be the sympathy of the brake for a hunted creature Any
unwounded creature strong and resourceful was safe when he had glided
under the low rustling green roof of this wild covert It was not hard
to conceal tracks the springy soil gave forth no sound and men could
hunt each other for weeks pass within a few yards of each other and
never know it The problem of sustaining life was difficult but then
hunted men and animals survived on very little

Duane wanted to cross the river if that was possible and keeping
in the brake work his way upstream till he had reached country more
hospitable Remembering what the man had said in regard to the river
Duane had his doubts about crossing But he would take any chance to put
the river between him and his hunters He pushed on His left arm had to
be favored as he could scarcely move it Using his right to spread the
willows he slipped sideways between them and made fast time There
were narrow aisles and washes and holes low down and paths brushed by
animals all of which he took advantage of running walking crawling
stooping any way to get along To keep in a straight line was not
easyhe did it by marking some bright sunlit stem or tree ahead and
when he reached it looked straight on to mark another His progress
necessarily grew slower for as he advanced the brake became wilder
denser darker Mosquitoes began to whine about his head He kept on
without pause Deepening shadows under the willows told him that the
afternoon was far advanced He began to fear he had wandered in a wrong
direction Finally a strip of light ahead relieved his anxiety and
after a toilsome penetration of still denser brush he broke through to
the bank of the river

He faced a wide shallow muddy stream with brakes on the opposite bank
extending like a green and yellow wall Duane perceived at a glance the
futility of his trying to cross at this point Everywhere the sluggish
water raved quicksand bars In fact the bed of the river was all
quicksand and very likely there was not a foot of water anywhere He
could not swim he could not crawl he could not push a log across Any
solid thing touching that smooth yellow sand would be grasped and sucked
down To prove this he seized a long pole and reaching down from the
high bank thrust it into the stream Right there near shore there
apparently was no bottom to the treacherous quicksand He abandoned any
hope of crossing the river Probably for miles up and down it would be
just the same as here Before leaving the bank he tied his hat upon the
pole and lifted enough water to quench his thirst Then he worked his
way back to where thinner growth made advancement easier and kept on
upstream till the shadows were so deep he could not see Feeling around
for a place big enough to stretch out on he lay down For the time
being he was as safe there as he would have been beyond in the Rim Rock
He was tired though not exhausted and in spite of the throbbing pain
in his arm he dropped at once into sleep



CHAPTER XII

Some time during the night Duane awoke A stillness seemingly so thick
and heavy as to have substance blanketed the black willow brake He
could not see a star or a branch or treetrunk or even his hand before
his eyes He lay there waiting listening sure that he had been
awakened by an unusual sound Ordinary noises of the night in the
wilderness never disturbed his rest His faculties like those of
old fugitives and hunted creatures had become trained to a marvelous
keenness A long low breath of slow wind moaned through the willows
passed away some stealthy softfooted beast trotted by him in the
darkness there was a rustling among dry leaves a fox barked lonesomely
in the distance But none of these sounds had broken his slumber

Suddenly piercing the stillness came a bay of a bloodhound Quickly
Duane sat up chilled to his marrow The action made him aware of
his crippled arm Then came other bays lower more distant Silence
enfolded him again all the more oppressive and menacing in his
suspense Bloodhounds had been put on his trail and the leader was not
far away All his life Duane had been familiar with bloodhounds and he
knew that if the pack surrounded him in this impenetrable darkness he
would be held at bay or dragged down as wolves dragged a stag Rising to
his feet prepared to flee as best he could he waited to be sure of the
direction he should take

The leader of the hounds broke into cry again a deep fulltoned
ringing bay strange ominous terribly significant in its power It
caused a cold sweat to ooze out all over Duanes body He turned from
it and with his uninjured arm outstretched to feel for the willows
he groped his way along As it was impossible to pick out the narrow
passages he had to slip and squeeze and plunge between the yielding
stems He made such a crashing that he no longer heard the baying of
the hounds He had no hope to elude them He meant to climb the first
cottonwood that he stumbled upon in his blind flight But it appeared
he never was going to be lucky enough to run against one Often he fell
sometimes flat at others upheld by the willows What made the work
so hard was the fact that he had only one arm to open a clump of
closegrowing stems and his feet would catch or tangle in the narrow
crotches holding him fast He had to struggle desperately It was as if
the willows were clutching hands his enemies fiendishly impeding his
progress He tore his clothes on sharp branches and his flesh suffered
many a prick But in a terrible earnestness he kept on until he brought
up hard against a cottonwood tree

There he leaned and rested He found himself as nearly exhausted as he
had ever been wet with sweat his hands torn and burning his breast
laboring his legs stinging from innumerable bruises While he leaned
there to catch his breath he listened for the pursuing hounds For a
long time there was no sound from them This however did not deceive
him into any hopefulness There were bloodhounds that bayed often on a
trail and others that ran mostly silent The former were more valuable
to their owner and the latter more dangerous to the fugitive Presently
Duanes ears were filled by a chorus of short ringing yelps The pack
had found where he had slept and now the trail was hot Satisfied that
they would soon overtake him Duane set about climbing the cottonwood
which in his condition was difficult of ascent

It happened to be a fairly large tree with a fork about fifteen feet up
and branches thereafter in succession Duane climbed until he got above
the enshrouding belt of blackness A pale gray mist hung above the
brake and through it shone a line of dim lights Duane decided these
were bonfires made along the bluff to render his escape more difficult
on that side Away round in the direction he thought was north he
imagined he saw more fires but as the mist was thick he could not be
sure While he sat there pondering the matter listening for the hounds
the mist and the gloom on one side lightened and this side he concluded
was east and meant that dawn was near Satisfying himself on this score
he descended to the first branch of the tree

His situation now though still critical did not appear to be so
hopeless as it had been The hounds would soon close in on him and
he would kill them or drive them away It was beyond the bounds of
possibility that any men could have followed running hounds through that
brake in the night The thing that worried Duane was the fact of the
bonfires He had gathered from the words of one of his pursuers that the
brake was a kind of trap and he began to believe there was only one way
out of it and that was along the bank where he had entered and where
obviously all night long his pursuers had kept fires burning Further
conjecture on this point however was interrupted by a crashing in the
willows and the rapid patter of feet

Underneath Duane lay a gray foggy obscurity He could not see the
ground nor any object but the black trunk of the tree Sight would
not be needed to tell him when the pack arrived With a pattering rush
through the willows the hounds reached the tree and then high above
crash of brush and thud of heavy paws rose a hideous clamor Duanes
pursuers far off to the south would hear that and know what it meant
And at daybreak perhaps before they would take a short cut across the
brake guided by the baying of hounds that had treed their quarry

It wanted only a few moments however till Duane could distinguish the
vague forms of the hounds in the gray shadow below Still he waited He
had no shots to spare And he knew how to treat bloodhounds Gradually
the obscurity lightened and at length Duane had good enough sight of
the hounds for his purpose His first shot killed the huge brute leader
of the pack Then with unerring shots he crippled several others That
stopped the baying Piercing howls arose The pack took fright and fled
its course easily marked by the howls of the crippled members Duane
reloaded his gun and making certain all the hounds had gone he
descended to the ground and set off at a rapid pace to the northward

The mist had dissolved under a rising sun when Duane made his first
halt some miles north of the scene where he had waited for the hounds A
barrier to further progress in shape of a precipitous rocky bluff rose
sheer from the willow brake He skirted the base of the cliff where
walking was comparatively easy around in the direction of the river He
reached the end finally to see there was absolutely no chance to escape
from the brake at that corner It took extreme labor attended by some
hazard and considerable pain to his arm to get down where he could fill
his sombrero with water After quenching his thirst he had a look at his
wound It was caked over with blood and dirt When washed off the arm
was seen to be inflamed and swollen around the bullethole He bathed
it experiencing a soothing relief in the cool water Then he bandaged
it as best he could and arranged a sling round his neck This mitigated
the pain of the injured member and held it in a quiet and restful
position where it had a chance to begin mending

As Duane turned away from the river he felt refreshed His great
strength and endurance had always made fatigue something almost unknown
to him However tramping on foot day and night was as unusual to him as
to any other riders of the Southwest and it had begun to tell on him
Retracing his steps he reached the point where he had abruptly come
upon the bluff and here he determined to follow along its base in the
other direction until he found a way out or discovered the futility of
such effort

Duane covered ground rapidly From time to time he paused to listen But
he was always listening and his eyes were ever roving This alertness
had become second nature with him so that except in extreme cases
of caution he performed it while he pondered his gloomy and fateful
situation Such habit of alertness and thought made time fly swiftly

By noon he had rounded the wide curve of the brake and was facing
south The bluff had petered out from a high mountainous wall to a
low abutment of rock but it still held to its steep rough nature and
afforded no crack or slope where quick ascent could have been possible
He pushed on growing warier as he approached the dangerzone finding
that as he neared the river on this side it was imperative to go deeper
into the willows In the afternoon he reached a point where he could see
men pacing to and fro on the bluff This assured him that whatever place
was guarded was one by which he might escape He headed toward these men
and approached to within a hundred paces of the bluff where they were
There were several men and several boys all armed and after the manner
of Texans taking their task leisurely Farther down Duane made out
black dots on the horizon of the bluffline and these he concluded were
more guards stationed at another outlet Probably all the available men
in the district were on duty Texans took a grim pleasure in such work
Duane remembered that upon several occasions he had served such duty
himself

Duane peered through the branches and studied the lay of the land For
several hundred yards the bluff could be climbed He took stock of those
careless guards They had rifles and that made vain any attempt to pass
them in daylight He believed an attempt by night might be successful
and he was swiftly coming to a determination to hide there till dark and
then try it when the sudden yelping of a dog betrayed him to the guards
on the bluff

The dog had likely been placed there to give an alarm and he was
lustily true to his trust Duane saw the men run together and begin to
talk excitedly and peer into the brake which was a signal for him to
slip away under the willows He made no noise and he assured himself he
must be invisible Nevertheless he heard shouts then the cracking of
rifles and bullets began to zip and swish through the leafy covert The
day was hot and windless and Duane concluded that whenever he touched
a willow stem even ever so slightly it vibrated to the top and sent
a quiver among the leaves Through this the guards had located his
position Once a bullet hissed by him another thudded into the ground
before him This shooting loosed a rage in Duane He had to fly from
these men and he hated them and himself because of it Always in
the fury of such moments he wanted to give back shot for shot But
he slipped on through the willows and at length the rifles ceased to
crack

He sheered to the left again in line with the rocky barrier and kept
on wondering what the next mile would bring

It brought worse for he was seen by sharpeyed scouts and a hot
fusillade drove him to run for his life luckily to escape with no more
than a bulletcreased shoulder

Later that day still undaunted he sheered again toward the trapwall
and found that the nearer he approached to the place where he had
come down into the brake the greater his danger To attempt to run the
blockade of that trail by day would be fatal He waited for night and
after the brightness of the fires had somewhat lessened he assayed to
creep out of the brake He succeeded in reaching the foot of the bluff
here only a bank and had begun to crawl stealthily up under cover of
a shadow when a hound again betrayed his position Retreating to the
willows was as perilous a task as had ever confronted Duane and when he
had accomplished it right under what seemed a hundred blazing rifles
he felt that he had indeed been favored by Providence This time men
followed him a goodly ways into the brake and the ripping of lead
through the willows sounded on all sides of him

When the noise of pursuit ceased Duane sat down in the darkness his
mind clamped between two thingswhether to try again to escape or
wait for possible opportunity He seemed incapable of decision His
intelligence told him that every hour lessened his chances for escape
He had little enough chance in any case and that was what made another
attempt so desperately hard Still it was not love of life that bound
him There would come an hour sooner or later when he would wrench
decision out of this chaos of emotion and thought But that time was not
yet He had remained quiet long enough to cool off and recover from his
run he found that he was tired He stretched out to rest But the swarms
of vicious mosquitoes prevented sleep This corner of the brake was low
and near the river a breedingground for the bloodsuckers They sang
and hummed and whined around him in an everincreasing horde He covered
his head and hands with his coat and lay there patiently That was a
long and wretched night Morning found him still strong physically but
in a dreadful state of mind

First he hurried for the river He could withstand the pangs of hunger
but it was imperative to quench thirst His wound made him feverish
and therefore more than usually hot and thirsty Again he was refreshed
That morning he was hard put to it to hold himself back from attempting
to cross the river If he could find a light log it was within the
bounds of possibility that he might ford the shallow water and bars of
quicksand But not yet Wearily doggedly he faced about toward the
bluff

All that day and all that night all the next day and all the next
night he stole like a hunted savage from river to bluff and every hour
forced upon him the bitter certainty that he was trapped

Duane lost track of days of events He had come to an evil pass
There arrived an hour when closely pressed by pursuers at the extreme
southern corner of the brake he took to a dense thicket of willows
driven to what he believed was his last stand

If only these human bloodhounds would swiftly close in on him Let him
fight to the last bitter gasp and have it over But these hunters eager
as they were to get him had care of their own skins They took few
risks They had him cornered

It was the middle of the day hot dusty oppressive threatening storm
Like a snake Duane crawled into a little space in the darkest part of
the thicket and lay still Men had cut him off from the bluff from the
river seemingly from all sides But he heard voices only from in front
and toward his left Even if his passage to the river had not been
blocked it might just as well have been

Come on fellersdown hyar called one man from the bluff

Got him corralled at last shouted another

Reckon ye neednt be too shore We thought thet moren once taunted
another

I seen him I tell you

Aw thet was a deer

But Bill found fresh tracks an blood on the willows

If hes winged we neednt hurry

Hold on thar you boys came a shout in authoritative tones from
farther up the bluff Go slow Youall air gittin foolish at the end
of a long chase

Thets right Colonel Hold em back Theres nothin shorer than
somebodyll be stoppin lead pretty quick Hell be huntin us soon

Lets surround this corner an starve him out

Fire the brake

How clearly all this talk pierced Duanes ears In it he seemed to hear
his doom This then was the end he had always expected which had been
close to him before yet never like now

By God whispered Duane the thing for me to do nowis go outmeet
them

That was prompted by the fighting the killing instinct in him In that
moment it had almost superhuman power If he must die that was the way
for him to die What else could be expected of Buck Duane He got to his
knees and drew his gun With his swollen and almost useless hand he held
what spare ammunition he had left He ought to creep out noiselessly to
the edge of the willows suddenly face his pursuers then while there
was a beat left in his heart kill kill kill These men all had
rifles The fight would be short But the marksmen did not live on earth
who could make such a fight go wholly against him Confronting them
suddenly he could kill a man for every shot in his gun

Thus Duane reasoned So he hoped to accept his fateto meet this end
But when he tried to step forward something checked him He forced
himself yet he could not go The obstruction that opposed his will was
as insurmountable as it had been physically impossible for him to climb
the bluff

Slowly he fell back crouched low and then lay flat The grim and
ghastly dignity that had been his a moment before fell away from him He
lay there stripped of his last shred of selfrespect He wondered was
he afraid had he the last of the Duaneshad he come to feel fear No
Never in all his wild life had he so longed to go out and meet men face
to face It was not fear that held him back He hated this hiding
this eternal vigilance this hopeless life The damnable paradox of the
situation was that if he went out to meet these men there was absolutely
no doubt of his doom If he clung to his covert there was a chance a
merest chance for his life These pursuers dogged and unflagging as
they had been were mortally afraid of him It was his fame that made
them cowards Duanes keenness told him that at the very darkest and
most perilous moment there was still a chance for him And the blood in
him the temper of his father the years of his outlawry the pride of
his unsought and hated career the nameless inexplicable something in
him made him accept that slim chance

Waiting then became a physical and mental agony He lay under the
burning sun parched by thirst laboring to breathe sweating and
bleeding His uncaredfor wound was like a redhot prong in his
flesh Blotched and swollen from the neverending attack of flies and
mosquitoes his face seemed twice its natural size and it ached and
stung

On one side then was this physical torture on the other the old hell
terribly augmented at this crisis in his mind It seemed that thought
and imagination had never been so swift If death found him presently
how would it come Would he get decent burial or be left for the
peccaries and the coyotes Would his people ever know where he had
fallen How wretched how miserable his state It was cowardly it was
monstrous for him to cling longer to this doomed life Then the hate in
his heart the hellish hate of these men on his trailthat was like a
scourge He felt no longer human He had degenerated into an animal that
could think His heart pounded his pulse beat his breast heaved
and this internal strife seemed to thunder into his ears He was now
enacting the tragedy of all crippled starved hunted wolves at bay in
their dens Only his tragedy was infinitely more terrible because he
had mind enough to see his plight his resemblance to a lonely wolf
bloodyfanged dripping snarling fireeyed in a last instinctive
defiance

Mounted upon the horror of Duanes thought was a watching listening
intensity so supreme that it registered impressions which were creations
of his imagination He heard stealthy steps that were not there he saw
shadowy moving figures that were only leaves A hundred times when he
was about to pull trigger he discovered his error Yet voices came from
a distance and steps and crackings in the willows and other sounds
real enough But Duane could not distinguish the real from the false
There were times when the wind which had arisen sent a hot pattering
breath down the willow aisles and Duane heard it as an approaching
army

This straining of Duanes faculties brought on a reaction which in
itself was a respite He saw the sun darkened by thick slow spreading
clouds A storm appeared to be coming How slowly it moved The air
was like steam If there broke one of those dark violent storms common
though rare to the country Duane believed he might slip away in the
fury of wind and rain Hope that seemed unquenchable in him resurged
again He hailed it with a bitterness that was sickening

Then at a rustling step he froze into the old strained attention He
heard a slow patter of soft feet A tawny shape crossed a little opening
in the thicket It was that of a dog The moment while that beast came
into full view was an age The dog was not a bloodhound and if he had
a trail or a scent he seemed to be at fault on it Duane waited for the
inevitable discovery Any kind of a huntingdog could have found him
in that thicket Voices from outside could be heard urging on the dog
Rover they called him Duane sat up at the moment the dog entered the
little shaded covert Duane expected a yelping a baying or at least
a bark that would tell of his hidingplace A strange relief swiftly
swayed over Duane The end was near now He had no further choice Let
them comea quick fierce exchange of shotsand then this torture past
He waited for the dog to give the alarm

But the dog looked at him and trotted by into the thicket without a
yelp Duane could not believe the evidence of his senses He thought he
had suddenly gone deaf He saw the dog disappear heard him running to
and fro among the willows getting farther and farther away till all
sound from him ceased

Thars Rover called a voice from the bluffside Hes been through
thet black patch

Nary a rabbit in there replied another

Bah Thet pups no good scornfully growled another man Put a hound
at thet clump of willows

Fires the game Burn the brake before the rain comes

The voices droned off as their owners evidently walked up the ridge

Then upon Duane fell the crushing burden of the old waiting watching
listening spell After all it was not to end just now His chance still
persistedlooked a little brighterled him on perhaps to forlorn
hope

All at once twilight settled quickly down upon the willow brake or else
Duane noted it suddenly He imagined it to be caused by the approaching
storm But there was little movement of air or cloud and thunder still
muttered and rumbled at a distance The fact was the sun had set and at
this time of overcast sky night was at hand

Duane realized it with the awakening of all his old force He would yet
elude his pursuers That was the moment when he seized the significance
of all these fortunate circumstances which had aided him Without haste
and without sound he began to crawl in the direction of the river It
was not far and he reached the bank before darkness set in There were
men up on the bluff carrying wood to build a bonfire For a moment he
half yielded to a temptation to try to slip along the rivershore close
in under the willows But when he raised himself to peer out he saw that
an attempt of this kind would be liable to failure At the same moment
he saw a roughhewn plank lying beneath him lodged against some
willows The end of the plank extended in almost to a point beneath him
Quick as a flash he saw where a desperate chance invited him Then he
tied his gun in an oilskin bag and put it in his pocket

The bank was steep and crumbly He must not break off any earth to
splash into the water There was a willow growing back some few feet
from the edge of the bank Cautiously he pulled it down bent it over
the water so that when he released it there would be no springing back
Then he trusted his weight to it with his feet sliding carefully
down the bank He went into the water almost up to his knees felt
the quicksand grip his feet then leaning forward till he reached the
plank he pulled it toward him and lay upon it

Without a sound one end went slowly under water and the farther end
appeared lightly braced against the overhanging willows Very carefully
then Duane began to extricate his right foot from the sucking sand
It seemed as if his foot was incased in solid rock But there was a
movement upward and he pulled with all the power he dared use It
came slowly and at length was free The left one he released with less
difficulty The next few moments he put all his attention on the plank
to ascertain if his weight would sink it into the sand The far end
slipped off the willows with a little splash and gradually settled
to rest upon the bottom But it sank no farther and Duanes greatest
concern was relieved However as it was manifestly impossible for him
to keep his head up for long he carefully crawled out upon the plank
until he could rest an arm and shoulder upon the willows

When he looked up it was to find the night strangely luminous with
fires There was a bonfire on the extreme end of the bluff another
a hundred paces beyond A great flare extended over the brake in that
direction Duane heard a roaring on the wind and he knew his pursuers
had fired the willows He did not believe that would help them much
The brake was dry enough but too green to burn readily And as for the
bonfires he discovered that the men probably having run out of wood
were keeping up the light with oil and stuff from the village A dozen
men kept watch on the bluff scarcely fifty paces from where Duane lay
concealed by the willows They talked cracked jokes sang songs and
manifestly considered this outlawhunting a great lark As long as the
bright light lasted Duane dared not move He had the patience and the
endurance to wait for the breaking of the storm and if that did not
come then the early hour before dawn when the gray fog and gloom were
over the river

Escape was now in his grasp He felt it And with that in his mind he
waited strong as steel in his conviction capable of withstanding any
strain endurable by the human frame

The wind blew in puffs grew wilder and roared through the willows
carrying bright sparks upward Thunder rolled down over the river and
lightning began to flash Then the rain fell in heavy sheets but
not steadily The flashes of lightning and the broad flares played so
incessantly that Duane could not trust himself out on the open river
Certainly the storm rather increased the watchfulness of the men on
the bluff He knew how to wait and he waited grimly standing pain and
cramp and chill The storm wore away as desultorily as it had come
and the long night set in There were times when Duane thought he was
paralyzed others when he grew sick giddy weak from the strained
posture The first paling of the stars quickened him with a kind of wild
joy He watched them grow paler dimmer disappear one by one A shadow
hovered down rested upon the river and gradually thickened The
bonfire on the bluff showed as through a foggy veil The watchers were
mere groping dark figures

Duane aware of how cramped he had become from long inaction began
to move his legs and uninjured arm and body and at length overcame a
paralyzing stiffness Then digging his hand in the sand and holding the
plank with his knees he edged it out into the river Inch by inch he
advanced until clear of the willows Looking upward he saw the shadowy
figures of the men on the bluff He realized they ought to see him
feared that they would But he kept on cautiously noiselessly with a
heartnumbing slowness From time to time his elbow made a little gurgle
and splash in the water Try as he might he could not prevent this It
got to be like the hollow roar of a rapid filling his ears with mocking
sound There was a perceptible current out in the river and it hindered
straight advancement Inch by inch he crept on expecting to hear
the bang of rifles the spattering of bullets He tried not to look
backward but failed The fire appeared a little dimmer the moving
shadows a little darker

Once the plank stuck in the sand and felt as if it were settling
Bringing feet to aid his hand he shoved it over the treacherous place
This way he made faster progress The obscurity of the river seemed to
be enveloping him When he looked back again the figures of the men were
coalescing with the surrounding gloom the fires were streaky blurred
patches of light But the sky above was brighter Dawn was not far off

To the west all was dark With infinite care and implacable spirit
and waning strength Duane shoved the plank along and when at last he
discerned the black border of bank it came in time he thought to save
him He crawled out rested till the gray dawn broke and then headed
north through the willows



CHAPTER XIII

How long Duane was traveling out of that region he never knew But he
reached familiar country and found a rancher who had before befriended
him Here his arm was attended to he had food and sleep and in a
couple of weeks he was himself again

When the time came for Duane to ride away on his endless trail his
friend reluctantly imparted the information that some thirty miles
south near the village of Shirley there was posted at a certain
crossroad a reward for Buck Duane dead or alive Duane had heard of
such notices but he had never seen one His friends reluctance and
refusal to state for what particular deed this reward was offered roused
Duanes curiosity He had never been any closer to Shirley than this
ranchers home Doubtless some postoffice burglary some gunshooting
scrape had been attributed to him And he had been accused of worse
deeds Abruptly Duane decided to ride over there and find out who wanted
him dead or alive and why

As he started south on the road he reflected that this was the first
time he had ever deliberately hunted trouble Introspection awarded him
this knowledge during that last terrible flight on the lower Nueces
and while he lay abed recuperating he had changed A fixed immutable
hopeless bitterness abided with him He had reached the end of his rope
All the power of his mind and soul were unavailable to turn him back
from his fate

That fate was to become an outlaw in every sense of the term to be
what he was credited with beingthat is to say to embrace evil He
had never committed a crime He wondered now was crime close to him He
reasoned finally that the desperation of crime had been forced upon
him if not its motive and that if driven there was no limit to his
possibilities He understood now many of the hitherto inexplicable
actions of certain noted outlawswhy they had returned to the scene
of the crime that had outlawed them why they took such strangely fatal
chances why life was no more to them than a breath of wind why they
rode straight into the jaws of death to confront wronged men or
hunting rangers vigilantes to laugh in their very faces It was such
bitterness as this that drove these men

Toward afternoon from the top of a long hill Duane saw the green
fields and trees and shining roofs of a town he considered must be
Shirley And at the bottom of the hill he came upon an intersecting
road There was a placard nailed on the crossroad signpost Duane drew
rein near it and leaned close to read the faded print 1000 REWARD FOR
BUCK DUANE DEAD OR ALIVE Peering closer to read the finer more faded
print Duane learned that he was wanted for the murder of Mrs Jeff
Aiken at her ranch near Shirley The month September was named but the
date was illegible The reward was offered by the womans husband whose
name appeared with that of a sheriffs at the bottom of the placard

Duane read the thing twice When he straightened he was sick with the
horror of his fate wild with passion at those misguided fools who could
believe that he had harmed a woman Then he remembered Kate Bland and
as always when she returned to him he quaked inwardly Years before
word had gone abroad that he had killed her and so it was easy for
men wanting to fix a crime to name him Perhaps it had been done often
Probably he bore on his shoulders a burden of numberless crimes

A dark passionate fury possessed him It shook him like a storm
shakes the oak When it passed leaving him cold with clouded brow and
piercing eye his mind was set Spurring his horse he rode straight
toward the village

Shirley appeared to be a large pretentious country town A branch of
some railroad terminated there The main street was wide bordered by
trees and commodious houses and many of the stores were of brick
A large plaza shaded by giant cottonwood trees occupied a central
location

Duane pulled his running horse and halted him plunging and snorting
before a group of idle men who lounged on benches in the shade of a
spreading cottonwood How many times had Duane seen just that kind of
lazy shirtsleeved Texas group Not often however had he seen such
placid lolling goodnatured men change their expression their
attitude so swiftly His advent apparently was momentous They evidently
took him for an unusual visitor So far as Duane could tell not one of
them recognized him had a hint of his identity

He slid off his horse and threw the bridle

Im Buck Duane he said I saw that placardout there on a
signpost Its a damn lie Somebody find this man Jeff Aiken I want to
see him

His announcement was taken in absolute silence That was the only effect
he noted for he avoided looking at these villagers The reason was
simple enough Duane felt himself overcome with emotion There were
tears in his eyes He sat down on a bench put his elbows on his knees
and his hands to his face For once he had absolutely no concern for his
fate This ignominy was the last straw

Presently however he became aware of some kind of commotion among
these villagers He heard whisperings low hoarse voices then the
shuffle of rapid feet moving away All at once a violent hand jerked
his gun from its holster When Duane rose a gaunt man livid of face
shaking like a leaf confronted him with his own gun

Hands up thar you Buck Duane he roared waving the gun

That appeared to be the cue for pandemonium to break loose Duane opened
his lips to speak but if he had yelled at the top of his lungs he could
not have made himself heard In weary disgust he looked at the gaunt
man and then at the others who were working themselves into a frenzy
He made no move however to hold up his hands The villagers surrounded
him emboldened by finding him now unarmed Then several men lay hold of
his arms and pinioned them behind his back Resistance was useless even
if Duane had had the spirit Some one of them fetched his halter from
his saddle and with this they bound him helpless

People were running now from the street the stores the houses Old
men cowboys clerks boys ranchers came on the trot The crowd grew
The increasing clamor began to attract women as well as men A group of
girls ran up then hung back in fright and pity

The presence of cowboys made a difference They split up the crowd got
to Duane and lay hold of him with rough businesslike hands One of
them lifted his fists and roared at the frenzied mob to fall back to
stop the racket He beat them back into a circle but it was some little
time before the hubbub quieted down so a voice could be heard

Shut up will youall he was yelling Give us a chance to hear
somethin Easy nowsoho There aint nobody goin to be hurt Thets
right everybody quiet now Lets see whats come off

This cowboy evidently one of authority or at least one of strong
personality turned to the gaunt man who still waved Duanes gun

Abe put the gun down he said It might go off Here give it to me
Now whats wrong Whos this roped gent an whats he done

The gaunt fellow who appeared now about to collapse lifted a shaking
hand and pointed

Thet thar fellerhes Buck Duane he panted

An angry murmur ran through the surrounding crowd

The rope The rope Throw it over a branch String him up cried an
excited villager

Buck Duane Buck Duane

Hang him

The cowboy silenced these cries

Abe how do you know this fellow is Buck Duane he asked sharply

Whyhe said so replied the man called Abe

What came the exclamation incredulously

Its a tarnal fact panted Abe waving his hands importantly He was
an old man and appeared to be carried away with the significance of his
deed He like to rid his hoss right over usall Then he jumped off
says he was Buck Duane an he wanted to see Jeff Aiken bad

This speech caused a second commotion as noisy though not so enduring
as the first When the cowboy assisted by a couple of his mates had
restored order again some one had slipped the nooseend of Duanes rope
over his head

Up with him screeched a wildeyed youth

The mob surged closer was shoved back by the cowboys

Abe if you aint drunk or crazy tell thet over ordered Abes
interlocutor

With some show of resentment and more of dignity Abe reiterated his
former statement

If hes Buck Duane hown hell did you get hold of his gun bluntly
queried the cowboy

Whyhe set down tharan he kind of hid his face on his hand An I
grabbed his gun an got the drop on him

What the cowboy thought of this was expressed in a laugh His mates
likewise grinned broadly Then the leader turned to Duane

Stranger I reckon youd better speak up for yourself he said

That stilled the crowd as no command had done

Im Buck Duane all right said Duane quietly It was this way

The big cowboy seemed to vibrate with a shock All the ruddy warmth left
his face his jaw began to bulge the corded veins in his neck stood out
in knots In an instant he had a hard stern strange look He shot out
a powerful hand that fastened in the front of Duanes blouse

Somethin queer here But if youre Duane youre sure in bad Any fool
ought to know that You mean it then

Yes

Rode in to shoot up the town eh Same old stunt of you gunfighters
Meant to kill the man who offered a reward Wanted to see Jeff Aiken
bad huh

No replied Duane Your citizen here misrepresented things He seems
a little off his head

Reckon he is Somebody is thats sure You claim Buck Duane then an
all his doings

Im Duane yes But I wont stand for the blame of things I never did
Thats why Im here I saw that placard out there offering the reward
Until now I never was within half a days ride of this town Im blamed
for what I never did I rode in here told who I was asked somebody to
send for Jeff Aiken

An then you set down an let this old guy throw your own gun on you
queried the cowboy in amazement

I guess thats it replied Duane

Well its powerful strange if youre really Buck Duane

A man elbowed his way into the circle

Its Duane I recognize him I seen him in moren one place he said
Sibert you can rely on what I tell you I dont know if hes locoed or
what But I do know hes the genuine Buck Duane Any one whod ever seen
him onct would never forget him

What do you want to see Aiken for asked the cowboy Sibert

I want to face him and tell him I never harmed his wife

Why

Because Im innocent thats all

Suppose we send for Aiken an he hears you an doesnt believe you
what then

If he wont believe mewhy then my cases so badId be better off
dead

A momentary silence was broken by Sibert

If this isnt a queer deal Boys reckon wed better send for Jeff

Somebody went fer him Hell be comin soon replied a man

Duane stood a head taller than that circle of curious faces He gazed
out above and beyond them It was in this way that he chanced to see a
number of women on the outskirts of the crowd Some were old with
hard faces like the men Some were young and comely and most of these
seemed agitated by excitement or distress They cast fearful pitying
glances upon Duane as he stood there with that noose round his neck
Women were more human than men Duane thought He met eyes that dilated
seemed fascinated at his gaze but were not averted It was the old
women who were voluble loud in expression of their feelings

Near the trunk of the cottonwood stood a slender woman in white Duanes
wandering glance rested upon her Her eyes were riveted upon him A
softhearted woman probably who did not want to see him hanged

Thar comes Jeff Aiken now called a man loudly

The crowd shifted and trampled in eagerness

Duane saw two men coming fast one of whom in the lead was of stalwart
build He had a gun in his hand and his manner was that of fierce
energy

The cowboy Sibert thrust open the jostling circle of men

Hold on Jeff he called and he blocked the man with the gun He
spoke so low Duane could not hear what he said and his form hid Aikens
face At that juncture the crowd spread out closed in and Aiken
and Sibert were caught in the circle There was a pushing forward a
pressing of many bodies hoarse cries and flinging handsagain the
insane tumult was about to break outthe demand for an outlaws blood
the call for a wild justice executed a thousand times before on Texass
bloody soil

Sibert bellowed at the dark encroaching mass The cowboys with him beat
and cuffed in vain

Jeff will you listen broke in Sibert hurriedly his hand on the
other mans arm

Aiken nodded coolly Duane who had seen many men in perfect control of
themselves under circumstances like these recognized the spirit that
dominated Aiken He was white cold passionless There were lines of
bitter grief deep round his lips If Duane ever felt the meaning of
death he felt it then

Sure this s your game Aiken said Sibert But hear me a minute
Reckon theres no doubt about this man bein Buck Duane He seen the
placard out at the crossroads He rides in to Shirley He says hes
Buck Duane an hes lookin for Jeff Aiken Thats all clear enough
You know how these gunfighters go lookin for trouble But heres
what stumps me Duane sits down there on the bench and lets old Abe
Strickland grab his gun ant get the drop on him Moren that he gives
me some strange talk about how if he couldnt make you believe hes
innocent hed better be dead You see for yourself Duane aint drunk or
crazy or locoed He doesnt strike me as a man who rode in here huntin
blood So I reckon youd better hold on till you hear what he has to
say

Then for the first time the drawnfaced hungryeyed giant turned his
gaze upon Duane He had intelligence which was not yet subservient to
passion Moreover he seemed the kind of man Duane would care to have
judge him in a critical moment like this

Listen said Duane gravely with his eyes steady on Aikens Im
Buck Duane I never lied to any man in my life I was forced into
outlawry Ive never had a chance to leave the country Ive killed
men to save my own life I never intentionally harmed any woman I rode
thirty miles todaydeliberately to see what this reward was who made
it what for When I read the placard I went sick to the bottom of
my soul So I rode in here to find youto tell you this I never saw
Shirley before today It was impossible for me to havekilled your
wife Last September I was two hundred miles north of here on the upper
Nueces I can prove that Men who know me will tell you I couldnt
murder a woman I havent any idea why such a deed should be laid at my
hands Its just that wild border gossip I have no idea what reasons
you have for holding me responsible I only knowyoure wrong Youve
been deceived And see here Aiken You understand Im a miserable man
Im about broken I guess I dont care any more for life for anything
If you cant look me in the eyes man to man and believe what I
saywhy by God you can kill me

Aiken heaved a great breath

Buck Duane whether Im impressed or not by what you say neednt
matter Youve had accusers justly or unjustly as will soon appear
The thing is we can prove you innocent or guilty My girl Lucy saw my
wifes assailant

He motioned for the crowd of men to open up

Somebodyyou Sibertgo for Lucy Thatll settle this thing

Duane heard as a man in an ugly dream The faces around him the hum of
voices all seemed far off His life hung by the merest thread Yet he
did not think of that so much as of the brand of a womanmurderer which
might be soon sealed upon him by a frightened imaginative child

The crowd trooped apart and closed again Duane caught a blurred image
of a slight girl clinging to Siberts hand He could not see distinctly
Aiken lifted the child whispered soothingly to her not to be afraid
Then he fetched her closer to Duane

Lucy tell me Did you ever see this man before asked Aiken huskily
and low Is he the onewho came in the house that daystruck you
downand dragged mama

Aikens voice failed

A lightning flash seemed to clear Duanes blurred sight He saw a pale
sad face and violet eyes fixed in gloom and horror upon his No terrible
moment in Duanes life ever equaled this one of silenceof suspense

Its aint him cried the child

Then Sibert was flinging the noose off Duanes neck and unwinding the
bonds round his arms The spellbound crowd awoke to hoarse exclamations

See there my locoed gents how easy youd hang the wrong man burst
out the cowboy as he made the ropeend hiss Youall are a lot of wise
rangers Haw haw

He freed Duane and thrust the bonehandled gun back in Duanes holster

You Abe there Reckon you pulled a stunt But dont try the like
again And men Ill gamble theres a hell of a lot of bad work Buck
Duanes named forwhich all he never done Clear away there Wheres
his hoss Duane the roads open out of Shirley

Sibert swept the gaping watchers aside and pressed Duane toward the
horse which another cowboy held Mechanically Duane mounted felt a
lift as he went up Then the cowboys hard face softened in a smile

I reckon it aint uncivil of me to sayhit that road quick he said
frankly

He led the horse out of the crowd Aiken joined him and between them
they escorted Duane across the plaza The crowd appeared irresistibly
drawn to follow

Aiken paused with his big hand on Duanes knee In it unconsciously
probably he still held the gun

Duane a word with you he said I believe youre not so black as
youve been painted I wish there was time to say more Tell me this
anyway Do you know the Ranger Captain MacNelly

I do not replied Duane in surprise

I met him only a week ago over in Fairfield went on Aiken hurriedly
He declared you never killed my wife I didnt believe himargued with
him We almost had hard words over it NowIm sorry The last thing he
said was If you ever see Duane dont kill him Send him into my camp
after dark He meant something strange WhatI cant say But he was
right and I was wrong If Lucy had batted an eye Id have killed you
Still I wouldnt advise you to hunt up MacNellys camp Hes clever
Maybe he believes theres no treachery in his new ideas of ranger
tactics I tell you for all its worth Goodby May God help you
further as he did this day

Duane said goodby and touched the horse with his spurs

So long Buck called Sibert with that frank smile breaking warm over
his brown face and he held his sombrero high



CHAPTER XIV

When Duane reached the crossing of the roads the name Fairfield on the
signpost seemed to be the thing that tipped the oscillating balance of
decision in favor of that direction

He answered here to unfathomable impulse If he had been driven to hunt
up Jeff Aiken now he was called to find this unknown ranger captain
In Duanes state of mind clear reasoning common sense or keenness were
out of the question He went because he felt he was compelled

Dusk had fallen when he rode into a town which inquiry discovered to be
Fairfield Captain MacNellys camp was stationed just out of the village
limits on the other side

No one except the boy Duane questioned appeared to notice his arrival
Like Shirley the town of Fairfield was large and prosperous compared
to the innumerable hamlets dotting the vast extent of southwestern
Texas As Duane rode through being careful to get off the main street
he heard the tolling of a churchbell that was a melancholy reminder of
his old home

There did not appear to be any camp on the outskirts of the town But as
Duane sat his horse peering around and undecided what further move to
make he caught the glint of flickering lights through the darkness
Heading toward them he rode perhaps a quarter of a mile to come upon a
grove of mesquite The brightness of several fires made the surrounding
darkness all the blacker Duane saw the moving forms of men and heard
horses He advanced naturally expecting any moment to be halted

Who goes there came the sharp call out of the gloom

Duane pulled his horse The gloom was impenetrable

One manalone replied Duane

A stranger

Yes

What do you want

Im trying to find the ranger camp

Youve struck it Whats your errand

I want to see Captain MacNelly

Get down and advance Slow Dont move your hands Its dark but I can
see

Duane dismounted and leading his horse slowly advanced a few paces
He saw a dully bright objecta gunbefore he discovered the man who
held it A few more steps showed a dark figure blocking the trail Here
Duane halted

Come closer stranger Lets have a look at you the guard ordered
curtly

Duane advanced again until he stood before the man Here the rays of
light from the fires flickered upon Duanes face

Reckon youre a stranger all right Whats your name and your business
with the Captain

Duane hesitated pondering what best to say

Tell Captain MacNelly Im the man hes been asking to ride into his
campafter dark finally said Duane

The ranger bent forward to peer hard at this night visitor His manner
had been alert and now it became tense

Come here one of you men quick he called without turning in the
least toward the campfire

Hello Whats up Pickens came the swift reply It was followed by a
rapid thud of boots on soft ground A dark form crossed the gleams from
the firelight Then a ranger loomed up to reach the side of the guard
Duane heard whispering the purport of which he could not catch The
second ranger swore under his breath Then he turned away and started
back

Here ranger before you go understand this My visit is
peacefulfriendly if youll let it be Mind I was asked to come
hereafter dark

Duanes clear penetrating voice carried far The listening rangers at
the campfire heard what he said

Ho Pickens Tell that fellow to wait replied an authoritative voice
Then a slim figure detached itself from the dark moving group at the
campfire and hurried out

Better be foxy Cap shouted a ranger in warning

Shut upall of you was the reply

This officer obviously Captain MacNelly soon joined the two rangers
who were confronting Duane He had no fear He strode straight up to
Duane

Im MacNelly he said If youre my man dont mention your
nameyet

All this seemed so strange to Duane in keeping with much that had
happened lately

I met Jeff Aiken today said Duane He sent me

Youve met Aiken exclaimed MacNelly sharp eager low By all
thats bully Then he appeared to catch himself to grow restrained

Men fall back leave us alone a moment

The rangers slowly withdrew

Buck Duane Its you he whispered eagerly

Yes

If I give my word youll not be arrestedyoull be treated
fairlywill you come into camp and consult with me

Certainly

Duane Im sure glad to meet you went on MacNelly and he extended
his hand

Amazed and touched scarcely realizing this actuality Duane gave his
hand and felt no unmistakable grip of warmth

It doesnt seem natural Captain MacNelly but I believe Im glad to
meet you said Duane soberly

You will be Now well go back to camp Keep your identity mum for the
present

He led Duane in the direction of the campfire

Pickers go back on duty he ordered and Beeson you look after
this horse

When Duane got beyond the line of mesquite which had hid a good view of
the campsite he saw a group of perhaps fifteen rangers sitting around
the fires near a long low shed where horses were feeding and a small
adobe house at one side

Weve just had grub but Ill see you get some Then well talk said
MacNelly Ive taken up temporary quarters here Have a rustler job on
hand Now when youve eaten come right into the house

Duane was hungry but he hurried through the ample supper that was set
before him urged on by curiosity and astonishment The only way
he could account for his presence there in a rangers camp was that
MacNelly hoped to get useful information out of him Still that would
hardly have made this captain so eager There was a mystery here and
Duane could scarcely wait for it to be solved While eating he had
bent keen eyes around him After a first quiet scrutiny the rangers
apparently paid no more attention to him They were all veterans in
serviceDuane saw thatand rugged powerful men of iron constitution
Despite the occasional joke and sally of the more youthful members and
a general conversation of campfire nature Duane was not deceived about
the fact that his advent had been an unusual and striking one which had
caused an undercurrent of conjecture and even consternation among them
These rangers were too well trained to appear openly curious about their
captains guest If they had not deliberately attempted to be oblivious
of his presence Duane would have concluded they thought him an ordinary
visitor somehow of use to MacNelly As it was Duane felt a suspense
that must have been due to a hint of his identity

He was not long in presenting himself at the door of the house

Come in and have a chair said MacNelly motioning for the one other
occupant of the room to rise Leave us Russell and close the door
Ill be through these reports right off

MacNelly sat at a table upon which was a lamp and various papers Seen
in the light he was a finelooking soldierly man of about forty years
darkhaired and darkeyed with a bronzed face shrewd stern strong
yet not wanting in kindliness He scanned hastily over some papers
fussed with them and finally put them in envelopes Without looking up
he pushed a cigarcase toward Duane and upon Duanes refusal to
smoke he took a cigar rose to light it at the lampchimney and then
settling back in his chair he faced Duane making a vain attempt to
hide what must have been the fulfilment of a longnourished curiosity

Duane Ive been hoping for this for two years he began

Duane smiled a littlea smile that felt strange on his face He had
never been much of a talker And speech here seemed more than ordinarily
difficult

MacNelly must have felt that

He looked long and earnestly at Duane and his quick nervous manner
changed to grave thoughtfulness

Ive lots to say but where to begin he mused Duane youve had
a hard life since you went on the dodge I never met you before dont
know what you looked like as a boy But I can see whatwell even
ranger life isnt all roses

He rolled his cigar between his lips and puffed clouds of smoke

Ever hear from home since you left Wellston he asked abruptly

No

Never a word

Not one replied Duane sadly

Thats tough Im glad to be able to tell you that up to just lately
your mother sister uncleall your folks I believewere well Ive
kept posted But havent heard lately

Duane averted his face a moment hesitated till the swelling left his
throat and then said Its worth what I went through today to hear
that

I can imagine how you feel about it When I was in the warbut lets
get down to the business of this meeting

He pulled his chair close to Duanes

Youve had word more than once in the last two years that I wanted to
see you

Three times I remember replied Duane

Why didnt you hunt me up

I supposed you imagined me one of those gunfighters who couldnt take
a dare and expected me to ride up to your camp and be arrested

That was natural I suppose went on MacNelly You didnt know me
otherwise you would have come Ive been a long time getting to you
But the nature of my job as far as youre concerned made me cautious
Duane youre aware of the hard name you bear all over the Southwest

Once in a while Im jarred into realizing replied Duane

Its the hardest barring Murrell and Cheseldine on the Texas border
But theres this difference Murrell in his day was known to deserve his
infamous name Cheseldine in his day also But Ive found hundreds
of men in southwest Texas whore your friends who swear you never
committed a crime The farther south I get the clearer this becomes
What I want to know is the truth Have you ever done anything criminal
Tell me the truth Duane It wont make any difference in my plan
And when I say crime I mean what I would call crime or any reasonable
Texan

That way my hands are clean replied Duane

You never held up a man robbed a store for grub stole a horse when
you needed him badnever anything like that

Somehow I always kept out of that just when pressed the hardest

Duane Im damn glad MacNelly exclaimed gripping Duanes hand Glad
for you mothers sakel But all the same in spite of this you are a
Texas outlaw accountable to the state Youre perfectly aware that under
existing circumstances if you fell into the hands of the law youd
probably hang at least go to jail for a long term

Thats what kept me on the dodge all these years replied Duane

Certainly MacNelly removed his cigar His eyes narrowed and
glittered The muscles along his brown cheeks set hard and tense He
leaned closer to Duane laid sinewy pressing fingers upon Duanes knee

Listen to this he whispered hoarsely If I place a pardon in your
handmake you a free honest citizen once more clear your name of
infamy make your mother your sister proud of youwill you swear
yourself to a service ANY service I demand of you

Duane sat stock still stunned

Slowly more persuasively with show of earnest agitation Captain
MacNelly reiterated his startling query

My God burst from Duane Whats this MacNelly you CANT be in
earnest

Never more so in my life Ive a deep game Im playing it square What
do you say

He rose to his feet Duane as if impelled rose with him Ranger and
outlaw then locked eyes that searched each others souls In MacNellys
Duane read truth strong fiery purpose hope even gladness and a
fugitive mounting assurance of victory

Twice Duane endeavored to speak failed of all save a hoarse incoherent
sound until forcing back a flood of speech he found a voice

Any service Every service MacNelly I give my word said Duane

A light played over MacNellys face warming out all the grim darkness
He held out his hand Duane met it with his in a clasp that men
unconsciously give in moments of stress

When they unclasped and Duane stepped back to drop into a chair MacNelly
fumbled for another cigarhe had bitten the other into shredsand
lighting it as before he turned to his visitor now calm and cool He
had the look of a man who had justly won something at considerable
cost His next move was to take a long leather case from his pocket and
extract from it several folded papers

Heres your pardon from the Governor he said quietly Youll see
when you look it over that its conditional When you sign this paper I
have here the condition will be met

He smoothed out the paper handed Duane a pen ran his forefinger along
a dotted line

Duanes hand was shaky Years had passed since he had held a pen It
was with difficulty that he achieved his signature Buckley Duanehow
strange the name looked

Right here ends the career of Buck Duane outlaw and gunfighter said
MacNelly and seating himself he took the pen from Duanes fingers and
wrote several lines in several places upon the paper Then with a smile
he handed it to Duane

That makes you a member of Company A Texas Rangers

So thats it burst out Duane a light breaking in upon his
bewilderment You want me for ranger service

Sure Thats it replied the Captain dryly Now to hear what that
service is to be Ive been a busy man since I took this job and as
you may have heard Ive done a few things I dont mind telling you
that political influence put me in here and that up Austin way theres a
good deal of friction in the Department of State in regard to whether or
not the ranger service is any goodwhether it should be discontinued or
not Im on the party side whos defending the ranger service I contend
that its made Texas habitable Well its been up to me to produce
results So far I have been successful My great ambition is to break
up the outlaw gangs along the river I have never ventured in there
yet because Ive been waiting to get the lieutenant I needed You of
course are the man I had in mind Its my idea to start way up the Rio
Grande and begin with Cheseldine Hes the strongest the worst outlaw
of the times Hes more than rustler Its Cheseldine and his gang
who are operating on the banks Theyre doing bankrobbing Thats my
private opinion but its not been backed up by any evidence Cheseldine
doesnt leave evidences Hes intelligent cunning No one seems to have
seen himto know what he looks like I assume of course that you are
a stranger to the country he dominates Its five hundred miles west of
your ground Theres a little town over there called Fairdale Its the
nest of a rustler gang They rustle and murder at will Nobody knows who
the leader is I want you to find out Well whatever way you decide is
best you will proceed to act upon You are your own boss You know such
men and how they can be approached You will take all the time needed
if its months It will be necessary for you to communicate with me and
that will be a difficult matter For Cheseldine dominates several whole
counties You must find some way to let me know when I and my rangers
are needed The plan is to break up Cheseldines gang Its the toughest
job on the border Arresting him alone isnt to be heard of He couldnt
be brought out Killing him isnt much better for his select men the
ones he operates with are as dangerous to the community as he is We
want to kill or jail this choice selection of robbers and break up the
rest of the gang To find them to get among them somehow to learn
their movements to lay your trap for us rangers to springthat Duane
is your service to me and God knows its a great one

I have accepted it replied Duane

Your work will be secret You are now a ranger in my service But no
one except the few I choose to tell will know of it until we pull off
the job You will simply be Buck Duane till it suits our purpose to
acquaint Texas with the fact that youre a ranger Youll see theres
no date on that paper No one will ever know just when you entered the
service Perhaps we can make it appear that all or most of your outlawry
has really been good service to the state At that Ill believe itll
turn out so

MacNelly paused a moment in his rapid talk chewed his cigar drew his
brows together in a dark frown and went on No man on the border knows
so well as you the deadly nature of this service Its a thousand to one
that youll be killed Id say there was no chance at all for any other
man beside you Your reputation will go far among the outlaws Maybe
that and your nerve and your gunplay will pull you through Im hoping
so But its a long long chance against your ever coming back

Thats not the point said Duane But in case I get killed out
therewhat

Leave that to me interrupted Captain MacNelly Your folks will know
at once of your pardon and your ranger duty If you lose your life out
there Ill see your name clearedthe service you render known You can
rest assured of that

I am satisfied replied Duane Thats so much more than Ive dared to
hope

Well its settled then Ill give you money for expenses Youll
start as soon as you likethe sooner the better I hope to think of
other suggestions especially about communicating with me

Long after the lights were out and the low hum of voices had ceased
round the campfire Duane lay wide awake eyes staring into the
blackness marveling over the strange events of the day He was humble
grateful to the depths of his soul A huge and crushing burden had been
lifted from his heart He welcomed this hazardous service to the man who
had saved him Thought of his mother and sister and Uncle Jim of his
home of old friends came rushing over him the first time in years that
he had happiness in the memory The disgrace he had put upon them would
now be removed and in the light of that his wasted life of the past
and its probable tragic end in future service as atonement changed their
aspects And as he lay there with the approach of sleep finally dimming
the vividness of his thought so full of mystery shadowy faces floated
in the blackness around him haunting him as he had always been haunted

It was broad daylight when he awakened MacNelly was calling him to
breakfast Outside sounded voices of men crackling of fires snorting
and stamping of horses the barking of dogs Duane rolled out of his
blankets and made good use of the soap and towel and razor and brush
near by on a benchthings of rare luxury to an outlaw on the ride The
face he saw in the mirror was as strange as the past he had tried so
hard to recall Then he stepped to the door and went out

The rangers were eating in a circle round a tarpaulin spread upon the
ground

Fellows said MacNelly shake hands with Buck Duane Hes on secret
ranger service for me Service thatll likely make you all hump soon
Mind you keep mum about it

The rangers surprised Duane with a roaring greeting the warmth of which
he soon divined was divided between pride of his acquisition to their
ranks and eagerness to meet that violent service of which their captain
hinted They were jolly wild fellows with just enough gravity in
their welcome to show Duane their respect and appreciation while not
forgetting his lonewolf record When he had seated himself in that
circle now one of them a feeling subtle and uplifting pervaded him

After the meal Captain MacNelly drew Duane aside

Heres the money Make it go as far as you can Better strike straight
for El Paso snook around there and hear things Then go to Valentine
Thats near the river and within fifty miles or so of the edge of the
Rim Rock Somewhere up there Cheseldine holds fort Somewhere to the
north is the town Fairdale But he doesnt hide all the time in the
rocks Only after some daring raid or holdup Cheseldines got border
towns on his staff or scared of him and these places we want to know
about especially Fairdale Write me care of the adjutant at Austin
I dont have to warn you to be careful where you mail letters Ride a
hundred two hundred miles if necessary or go clear to El Paso

MacNelly stopped with an air of finality and then Duane slowly rose

Ill start at once he said extending his hand to the Captain I
wishId like to thank you

Hell man Dont thank me replied MacNelly crushing the proffered
hand Ive sent a lot of good men to their deaths and maybe youre
another But as Ive said youve one chance in a thousand And by
Heaven Id hate to be Cheseldine or any other man you were trailing
No not goodbyAdios Duane May we meet again




BOOK II THE RANGER



CHAPTER XV

West of the Pecos River Texas extended a vast wild region barren in the
north where the Llano Estacado spread its shifting sands fertile in
the south along the Rio Grande A railroad marked an undeviating course
across five hundred miles of this country and the only villages and
towns lay on or near this line of steel Unsettled as was this western
Texas and despite the acknowledged dominance of the outlaw bands the
pioneers pushed steadily into it First had come the lone rancher then
his neighbors in near and far valleys then the hamlets at last the
railroad and the towns And still the pioneers came spreading
deeper into the valleys farther and wider over the plains It was
mesquitedotted cactuscovered desert but rich soil upon which water
acted like magic There was little grass to an acre but there were
millions of acres The climate was wonderful Cattle flourished and
ranchers prospered

The Rio Grande flowed almost due south along the western boundary for a
thousand miles and then weary of its course turned abruptly north
to make what was called the Big Bend The railroad running west cut
across this bend and all that country bounded on the north by the
railroad and on the south by the river was as wild as the Staked Plains
It contained not one settlement Across the face of this Big Bend as
if to isolate it stretched the Ord mountain range of which Mount
Ord Cathedral Mount and Elephant Mount raised bleak peaks above their
fellows In the valleys of the foothills and out across the plains were
ranches and farther north villages and the towns of Alpine and Marfa

Like other parts of the great Lone Star State this section of Texas
was a world in itselfa world where the riches of the rancher were
ever enriching the outlaw The village closest to the gateway of this
outlawinfested region was a little place called Ord named after the
dark peak that loomed some miles to the south It had been settled
originally by Mexicansthere were still the ruins of adobe
missionsbut with the advent of the rustler and outlaw many inhabitants
were shot or driven away so that at the height of Ords prosperity and
evil sway there were but few Mexicans living there and these had their
choice between holding handandglove with the outlaws or furnishing
target practice for that wild element

Toward the close of a day in September a stranger rode into Ord and in
a community where all men were remarkable for one reason or another
he excited interest His horse perhaps received the first and
most engaging attentionhorses in that region being apparently more
important than men This particular horse did not attract with beauty
At first glance he seemed ugly But he was a giant black as coal rough
despite the care manifestly bestowed upon him long of body ponderous
of limb huge in every way A bystander remarked that he had a grand
head True if only his head had been seen he would have been a
beautiful horse Like men horses show what they are in the shape the
size the line the character of the head This one denoted fire speed
blood loyalty and his eyes were as soft and dark as a womans His
face was solid black except in the middle of his forehead where there
was a round spot of white

Say mister mind tellin me his name asked a ragged urchin with born
love of a horse in his eyes

Bullet replied the rider

Thet theres fer the white mark aint it whispered the youngster to
another Say aint he a whopper Biggest hoss I ever seen

Bullet carried a huge black silverornamented saddle of Mexican make a
lariat and canteen and a small pack rolled into a tarpaulin

This rider apparently put all care of appearances upon his horse His
apparel was the ordinary jeans of the cowboy without vanity and it
was torn and travelstained His boots showed evidence of an intimate
acquaintance with cactus Like his horse this man was a giant in
stature but rangier not so heavily built Otherwise the only striking
thing about him was his somber face with its piercing eyes and hair
white over the temples He packed two guns both low downbut that was
too common a thing to attract notice in the Big Bend A close observer
however would have noted a singular factthis riders right hand was
more bronzed more weatherbeaten than his left He never wore a glove
on that right hand

He had dismounted before a ramshackle structure that bore upon its wide
highboarded front the sign Hotel There were horsemen coming and
going down the wide street between its rows of old stores saloons
and houses Ord certainly did not look enterprising Americans had
manifestly assimilated much of the leisure of the Mexicans The hotel
had a wide platform in front and this did duty as porch and sidewalk
Upon it and leaning against a hitchingrail were men of varying ages
most of them slovenly in old jeans and slouched sombreros Some were
booted belted and spurred No man there wore a coat but all wore
vests The guns in that group would have outnumbered the men

It was a crowd seemingly too lazy to be curious Good nature did not
appear to be wanting but it was not the frank and boisterous kind
natural to the cowboy or rancher in town for a day These men were
idlers what else perhaps was easy to conjecture Certainly to this
arriving stranger who flashed a keen eye over them they wore an
atmosphere never associated with work

Presently a tall man with a drooping sandy mustache leisurely
detached himself from the crowd

Howdy stranger he said

The stranger had bent over to loosen the cinches he straightened up and
nodded Then Im thirsty

That brought a broad smile to faces It was characteristic greeting
One and all trooped after the stranger into the hotel It was a dark
illsmelling barn of a place with a bar as high as a short mans head
A bartender with a scarred face was serving drinks

Line up gents said the stranger

They piled over one another to get to the bar with coarse jests and
oaths and laughter None of them noted that the stranger did not appear
so thirsty as he had claimed to be In fact though he went through the
motions he did not drink at all

My names Jim Fletcher said the tall man with the drooping sandy
mustache He spoke laconically nevertheless there was a tone that
showed he expected to be known Something went with that name The
stranger did not appear to be impressed

My name might be Blazes but it aint he replied What do you call
this burg

Stranger this heah metropoles bears the handle Ord Is thet new to
you

He leaned back against the bar and now his little yellow eyes clear as
crystal flawless as a hawks fixed on the stranger Other men crowded
close forming a circle curious ready to be friendly or otherwise
according to how the tall interrogator marked the newcomer

Sure Ords a little strange to me Off the railroad some aint it
Funny trails hereabouts

How fur was you goin

I reckon I was goin as far as I could replied the stranger with a
hard laugh

His reply had subtle reaction on that listening circle Some of the
men exchanged glances Fletcher stroked his drooping mustache seemed
thoughtful but lost something of that piercing scrutiny

Wal Ords the jumpinoff place he said presently Sure youve
heerd of the Big Bend country

I sure have an was makin tracks fer it replied the stranger

Fletcher turned toward a man in the outer edge of the group Knell
come in heah

This individual elbowed his way in and was seen to be scarcely more than
a boy almost pale beside those bronzed men with a long expressionless
face thin and sharp

Knell this heahs Fletcher wheeled to the stranger Whatd you
call yourself

Id hate to mention what Ive been callin myself lately

This sally fetched another laugh The stranger appeared cool careless
indifferent Perhaps he knew as the others present knew that this show
of Fletchers this pretense of introduction was merely talk while he
was looked over

Knell stepped up and it was easy to see from the way Fletcher
relinquished his part in the situation that a man greater than he had
appeared upon the scene

Any business here he queried curtly When he spoke his
expressionless face was in strange contrast with the ring the quality
the cruelty of his voice This voice betrayed an absence of humor of
friendliness of heart

Nope replied the stranger

Know anybody hereabouts

Nary one

Jest ridin through

Yep

Slopin fer back country eh

There came a pause The stranger appeared to grow a little resentful and
drew himself up disdainfully

Wal considerin youall seem so damn friendly an oncurious down
here in this Big Bend country I dont mind sayin yesI am in on the
dodge he replied with deliberate sarcasm

From west of Ordout El Paso way mebbe

Sure

Ahuh Thet so Knells words cut the air stilled the room Youre
from way down the river Thets what they say down thereon the
dodge Stranger youre a liar

With swift clink of spur and thump of boot the crowd split leaving
Knell and the stranger in the center

Wild breed of that ilk never made a mistake in judging a mans nerve
Knell had cut out with the trenchant call and stood ready The stranger
suddenly lost his every semblance to the rough and easy character before
manifest in him He became bronze That situation seemed familiar
to him His eyes held a singular piercing light that danced like a
compassneedle

Sure I lied he said so I aint takin offense at the way you called
me Im lookin to make friends not enemies You dont strike me as one
of them fourflushes achin to kill somebody But if you arego ahead
an open the ball You see I never throw a gun on them fellers till
they go fer theirs

Knell coolly eyed his antagonist his strange face not changing in the
least Yet somehow it was evident in his look that here was metal which
rang differently from what he had expected Invited to start a fight
or withdraw as he chose Knell proved himself big in the manner
characteristic of only the genuine gunman

Stranger I pass he said and turning to the bar he ordered liquor

The tension relaxed the silence broke the men filled up the gap the
incident seemed closed Jim Fletcher attached himself to the stranger
and now both respect and friendliness tempered his asperity

Wal fer want of a better handle Ill call you Dodge he said

Dodges as good as any Gents line up againan if you cant be
friendly be careful

Such was Buck Duanes debut in the little outlaw hamlet of Ord

Duane had been three months out of the Nueces country At El Paso
he bought the finest horse he could find and armed and otherwise
outfitted to suit him he had taken to unknown trails Leisurely he rode
from town to town village to village ranch to ranch fitting his talk
and his occupation to the impression he wanted to make upon different
people whom he met He was in turn a cowboy a rancher a cattleman
a stockbuyer a boomer a landhunter and long before he reached the
wild and inhospitable Ord he had acted the part of an outlaw drifting
into new territory He passed on leisurely because he wanted to learn
the lay of the country the location of villages and ranches the work
habit gossip pleasures and fears of the people with whom he came
in contact The one subject most impelling to himoutlawshe never
mentioned but by talking all around it sifting the old ranch and
cattle story he acquired a knowledge calculated to aid his plot In
this game time was of no moment if necessary he would take years to
accomplish his task The stupendous and perilous nature of it showed
in the slow wary preparation When he heard Fletchers name and faced
Knell he knew he had reached the place he sought Ord was a hamlet on
the fringe of the grazing country of doubtful honesty from which
surely winding trails led down into that free and neverdisturbed
paradise of outlawsthe Big Bend

Duane made himself agreeable yet not too much so to Fletcher and
several other men disposed to talk and drink and eat and then after
having a care for his horse he rode out of town a couple of miles to
a grove he had marked and there well hidden he prepared to spend the
night This proceeding served a double purposehe was safer and the
habit would look well in the eyes of outlaws who would be more inclined
to see in him the lonewolf fugitive

Long since Duane had fought out a battle with himself won a hardearned
victory His outer life the action was much the same as it had been
but the inner life had tremendously changed He could never become a
happy man he could never shake utterly those haunting phantoms that had
once been his despair and madness but he had assumed a task impossible
for any man save one like him he had felt the meaning of it grow
strangely and wonderfully and through that flourished up consciousness
of how passionately he now clung to this thing which would blot out his
former infamy The iron fetters no more threatened his hands the iron
door no more haunted his dreams He never forgot that he was free
Strangely too along with this feeling of new manhood there gathered
the force of imperious desire to run these chief outlaws to their dooms
He never called them outlawsbut rustlers thieves robbers murderers
criminals He sensed the growth of a relentless driving passion and
sometimes he feared that more than the newly acquired zeal and pride in
this ranger service it was the old terrible inherited killing instinct
lifting its hydrahead in new guise But of that he could not be sure
He dreaded the thought He could only wait

Another aspect of the change in Duane neither passionate nor driving
yet not improbably even more potent of new significance to life was
the imperceptible return of an old love of nature dead during his outlaw
days

For years a horse had been only a machine of locomotion to carry him
from place to place to beat and spur and goad mercilessly in flight
now this giant black with his splendid head was a companion a friend
a brother a loved thing guarded jealously fed and trained and ridden
with an intense appreciation of his great speed and endurance For years
the daytime with its birth of sunrise on through long hours to the
ruddy close had been used for sleep or rest in some rocky hole or
willow brake or deserted hut had been hated because it augmented danger
of pursuit because it drove the fugitive to lonely wretched hiding
now the dawn was a greeting a promise of another day to ride to plan
to remember and sun wind cloud rain skyall were joys to him
somehow speaking his freedom For years the night had been a black
space during which he had to ride unseen along the endless trails to
peer with cateyes through gloom for the moving shape that ever pursued
him now the twilight and the dusk and the shadows of grove and canon
darkened into night with its train of stars and brought him calm
reflection of the days happenings of the morrows possibilities
perhaps a sad brief procession of the old phantoms then sleep For
years canons and valleys and mountains had been looked at as retreats
that might be dark and wild enough to hide even an outlaw now he saw
these features of the great desert with something of the eyes of the boy
who had once burned for adventure and life among them

This night a wonderful afterglow lingered long in the west and against
the goldenred of clear sky the bold black head of Mount Ord reared
itself aloft beautiful but aloof sinister yet calling Small wonder
that Duane gazed in fascination upon the peak Somewhere deep in
its corrugated sides or lost in a rugged canon was hidden the secret
stronghold of the master outlaw Cheseldine All down along the ride from
El Paso Duane had heard of Cheseldine of his band his fearful deeds
his cunning his widely separated raids of his flitting here and there
like a Jackolantern but never a word of his den never a word of his
appearance

Next morning Duane did not return to Ord He struck off to the north
riding down a rough slowdescending road that appeared to have been
used occasionally for cattledriving As he had ridden in from the west
this northern direction led him into totally unfamiliar country While
he passed on however he exercised such keen observation that in the
future he would know whatever might be of service to him if he chanced
that way again

The rough wild brushcovered slope down from the foothills gradually
leveled out into plain a magnificent grazing country upon which till
noon of that day Duane did not see a herd of cattle or a ranch About
that time he made out smoke from the railroad and after a couple of
hours riding he entered a town which inquiry discovered to be Bradford
It was the largest town he had visited since Marfa and he calculated
must have a thousand or fifteen hundred inhabitants not including
Mexicans He decided this would be a good place for him to hold up for
a while being the nearest town to Ord only forty miles away So he
hitched his horse in front of a store and leisurely set about studying
Bradford

It was after dark however that Duane verified his suspicions
concerning Bradford The town was awake after dark and there was one
long row of saloons dancehalls gamblingresorts in full blast Duane
visited them all and was surprised to see wildness and license equal to
that of the old river camp of Blands in its palmiest days Here it was
forced upon him that the farther west one traveled along the river
the sparser the respectable settlements the more numerous the hard
characters and in consequence the greater the element of lawlessness
Duane returned to his lodginghouse with the conviction that MacNellys
task of cleaning up the Big Bend country was a stupendous one Yet he
reflected a company of intrepid and quickshooting rangers could have
soon cleaned up this Bradford

The innkeeper had one other guest that night a long blackcoated and
widesombreroed Texan who reminded Duane of his grandfather This man
had penetrating eyes a courtly manner and an unmistakable leaning
toward companionship and mintjuleps The gentleman introduced himself
as Colonel Webb of Marfa and took it as a matter of course that Duane
made no comment about himself

Sir its all one to me he said blandly waving his hand I have
traveled Texas is free and this frontier is one where its healthier
and just as friendly for a man to have no curiosity about his companion
You might be Cheseldine of the Big Bend or you might be Judge Little
of El Pasoits all one to me I enjoy drinking with you anyway

Duane thanked him conscious of a reserve and dignity that he could not
have felt or pretended three months before And then as always he was
a good listener Colonel Webb told among other things that he had come
out to the Big Bend to look over the affairs of a deceased brother who
had been a rancher and a sheriff of one of the towns Fairdale by name

Found no affairs no ranch not even his grave said Colonel Webb
And I tell you sir if hells any tougher than this Fairdale I dont
want to expiate my sins there

Fairdale I imagine sheriffs have a hard row to hoe out here
replied Duane trying not to appear curious

The Colonel swore lustily

My brother was the only honest sheriff Fairdale ever had It was
wonderful how long he lasted But he had nerve he could throw a gun
and he was on the square Then he was wise enough to confine his work
to offenders of his own town and neighborhood He let the riding outlaws
alone else he wouldnt have lasted at all What this frontier needs
sir is about six companies of Texas Rangers

Duane was aware of the Colonels close scrutiny

Do you know anything about the service he asked

I used to Ten years ago when I lived in San Antonio A fine body of
men sir and the salvation of Texas

Governor Stone doesnt entertain that opinion said Duane

Here Colonel Webb exploded Manifestly the governor was not his choice
for a chief executive of the great state He talked politics for a
while and of the vast territory west of the Pecos that seemed never to
get a benefit from Austin He talked enough for Duane to realize that
here was just the kind of intelligent wellinformed honest citizen
that he had been trying to meet He exerted himself thereafter to
be agreeable and interesting and he saw presently that here was an
opportunity to make a valuable acquaintance if not a friend

Im a stranger in these parts said Duane finally What is this
outlaw situation you speak of

Its damnable sir and unbelievable Not rustling any more but just
wholesale herdstealing in which some big cattlemen supposed to be
honest are equally guilty with the outlaws On this border you know
the rustler has always been able to steal cattle in any numbers But to
get rid of big bunchesthats the hard job The gang operating between
here and Valentine evidently have not this trouble Nobody knows where
the stolen stock goes But Im not alone in my opinion that most of
it goes to several big stockmen They ship to San Antonio Austin New
Orleans also to El Paso If you travel the stockroad between here and
Marfa and Valentine youll see dead cattle all along the line and stray
cattle out in the scrub The herds have been driven fast and far and
stragglers are not rounded up

Wholesale business eh remarked Duane Who are theseerbig
stockbuyers

Colonel Webb seemed a little startled at the abrupt query He bent his
penetrating gaze upon Duane and thoughtfully stroked his pointed beard

Names of course Ill not mention Opinions are one thing direct
accusation another This is not a healthy country for the informer

When it came to the outlaws themselves Colonel Webb was disposed to talk
freely Duane could not judge whether the Colonel had a hobby of that
subject or the outlaws were so striking in personality and deed that
any man would know all about them The great name along the river was
Cheseldine but it seemed to be a name detached from an individual No
person of veracity known to Colonel Webb had ever seen Cheseldine
and those who claimed that doubtful honor varied so diversely in
descriptions of the chief that they confused the reality and lent to
the outlaw only further mystery Strange to say of an outlaw leader as
there was no one who could identify him so there was no one who could
prove he had actually killed a man Blood flowed like water over the
Big Bend country and it was Cheseldine who spilled it Yet the fact
remained there were no eyewitnesses to connect any individual called
Cheseldine with these deeds of violence But in striking contrast to
this mystery was the person character and coldblooded action of
Poggin and Knell the chiefs lieutenants They were familiar figures in
all the towns within two hundred miles of Bradford Knell had a record
but as gunman with an incredible list of victims Poggin was supreme
If Poggin had a friend no one ever heard of him There were a hundred
stories of his nerve his wonderful speed with a gun his passion for
gambling his love of a horsehis cold implacable inhuman wiping out
of his path any man that crossed it

Cheseldine is a name a terrible name said Colonel Webb Sometimes
I wonder if hes not only a name In that case where does the brains of
this gang come from No there must be a master craftsman behind this
border pillage a master capable of handling those terrors Poggin and
Knell Of all the thousands of outlaws developed by western Texas in the
last twenty years these three are the greatest In southern Texas down
between the Pecos and the Nueces there have been and are still many
bad men But I doubt if any outlaw there possibly excepting Buck Duane
ever equaled Poggin Youve heard of this Duane

Yes a little replied Duane quietly Im from southern Texas Buck
Duane then is known out here

Why man where isnt his name known returned Colonel Webb Ive
kept track of his record as I have all the others Of course Duane
being a lone outlaw is somewhat of a mystery also but not like
Cheseldine Out here there have drifted many stories of Duane horrible
some of them But despite them a sort of romance clings to that Nueces
outlaw Hes killed three great outlaw leaders I believeBland
Hardin and the other I forgot Hardin was known in the Big Bend had
friends there Bland had a hard name at Del Rio

Then this man Duane enjoys rather an unusual repute west of the Pecos
inquired Duane

Hes considered more of an enemy to his kind than to honest men
I understand Duane had many friends that whole counties swear by
himsecretly of course for hes a hunted outlaw with rewards on his
head His fame in this country appears to hang on his matchless gunplay
and his enmity toward outlaw chiefs Ive heard many a rancher say I
wish to God that Buck Duane would drift out here Id give a hundred
pesos to see him and Poggin meet Its a singular thing stranger how
jealous these great outlaws are of each other

Yes indeed all about them is singular replied Duane Has
Cheseldines gang been busy lately

No This section has been free of rustling for months though theres
unexplained movements of stock Probably all the stock thats being
shipped now was rustled long ago Cheseldine works over a wide section
too wide for news to travel inside of weeks Then sometimes hes not
heard of at all for a spell These lulls are pretty surely indicative of
a big storm sooner or later And Cheseldines deals as they grow fewer
and farther between certainly get bigger more daring There are some
people who think Cheseldine had nothing to do with the bankrobberies
and trainholdups during the last few years in this country But thats
poor reasoning The jobs have been too well done too surely covered to
be the work of greasers or ordinary outlaws

Whats your view of the outlook Hows all this going to wind up Will
the outlaw ever be driven out asked Duane

Never There will always be outlaws along the Rio Grande All the
armies in the world couldnt comb the wild brakes of that fifteen
hundred miles of river But the sway of the outlaw such as is enjoyed
by these great leaders will sooner or later be past The criminal
element flock to the Southwest But not so thick and fast as the
pioneers Besides the outlaws kill themselves and the ranchers are
slowly rising in wrath if not in action That will come soon If they
only had a leader to start the fight But that will come Theres talk
of Vigilantes the same hat were organized in California and are now in
force in Idaho So far its only talk But the time will come And the
days of Cheseldine and Poggin are numbered

Duane went to bed that night exceedingly thoughtful The long trail was
growing hot This voluble colonel had given him new ideas It came
to Duane in surprise that he was famous along the upper Rio Grande
Assuredly he would not long be able to conceal his identity He had
no doubt that he would soon meet the chiefs of this clever and bold
rustling gang He could not decide whether he would be safer unknown or
known In the latter case his one chance lay in the fatality connected
with his name in his power to look it and act it Duane had never
dreamed of any sleuthhound tendency in his nature but now he felt
something like one Above all others his mind fixed on PogginPoggin
the brute the executor of Cheseldines will but mostly upon Poggin the
gunman This in itself was a warning to Duane He felt terrible forces
at work within him There was the stern and indomitable resolve to
make MacNellys boast good to the governor of the stateto break up
Cheseldines gang Yet this was not in Duanes mind before a strange
grim and deadly instinctwhich he had to drive away for fear he would
find in it a passion to kill Poggin not for the state nor for his word
to MacNelly but for himself Had his fathers blood and the hard years
made Duane the kind of man who instinctively wanted to meet Poggin He
was sworn to MacNellys service and he fought himself to keep that and
that only in his mind

Duane ascertained that Fairdale was situated two days ride from
Bradford toward the north There was a stage which made the journey
twice a week

Next morning Duane mounted his horse and headed for Fairdale He rode
leisurely as he wanted to learn all he could about the country
There were few ranches The farther he traveled the better grazing he
encountered and strange to note the fewer herds of cattle

It was just sunset when he made out a cluster of adobe houses that
marked the halfway point between Bradford and Fairdale Here Duane had
learned was stationed a comfortable inn for wayfarers

When he drew up before the inn the landlord and his family and a number
of loungers greeted him laconically

Beat the stage in hey remarked one

There she comes now said another Joel shore is drivin tonight

Far down the road Duane saw a cloud of dust and horses and a lumbering
coach When he had looked after the needs of his horse he returned to
the group before the inn They awaited the stage with that
interest common to isolated people Presently it rolled up a large
mudbespattered and dusty vehicle littered with baggage on top and
tied on behind A number of passengers alighted three of whom excited
Duanes interest One was a tall dark strikinglooking man and the
other two were ladies wearing long gray ulsters and veils Duane heard
the proprietor of the inn address the man as Colonel Longstreth and as
the party entered the inn Duanes quick ears caught a few words which
acquainted him with the fact that Longstreth was the Mayor of Fairdale

Duane passed inside himself to learn that supper would soon be ready
At table he found himself opposite the three who had attracted his
attention

Ruth I envy the lucky cowboys Longstreth was saying

Ruth was a curlyheaded girl with gray or hazel eyes

Im crazy to ride bronchos she said

Duane gathered she was on a visit to western Texas The other girls
deep voice sweet like a bell made Duane regard her closer She had
beauty as he had never seen it in another woman She was slender but
the development of her figure gave Duane the impression she was twenty
years old or more She had the most exquisite hands Duane had ever seen
She did not resemble the Colonel who was evidently her father She
looked tired quiet even melancholy A finely chiseled oval face
clear olivetinted skin long eyes set wide apart and black as coal
beautiful to look into a slender straight nose that had something
nervous and delicate about it which made Duane think of a thoroughbred
and a mouth by no means small but perfectly curved and hair like
jetall these features proclaimed her beauty to Duane Duane believed
her a descendant of one of the old French families of eastern Texas He
was sure of it when she looked at him drawn by his rather persistent
gaze There were pride fire and passion in her eyes Duane felt
himself blushing in confusion His stare at her had been rude perhaps
but unconscious How many years had passed since he had seen a girl like
her Thereafter he kept his eyes upon his plate yet he seemed to be
aware that he had aroused the interest of both girls

After supper the guests assembled in a big sittingroom where an open
fire place with blazing mesquite sticks gave out warmth and cheery glow
Duane took a seat by a table in the corner and finding a paper
began to read Presently when he glanced up he saw two darkfaced
men strangers who had not appeared before and were peering in from a
doorway When they saw Duane had observed them they stepped back out of
sight

It flashed over Duane that the strangers acted suspiciously In Texas
in the seventies it was always bad policy to let strangers go unheeded
Duane pondered a moment Then he went out to look over these two men
The doorway opened into a patio and across that was a little dingy
dimlighted barroom Here Duane found the innkeeper dispensing drinks
to the two strangers They glanced up when he entered and one of them
whispered He imagined he had seen one of them before In Texas where
outdoor men were so rough bronzed bold and sometimes grim of aspect
it was no easy task to pick out the crooked ones But Duanes years on
the border had augmented a natural instinct or gift to read character
or at least to sense the evil in men and he knew at once that these
strangers were dishonest

Hey somethin one of them asked leering Both looked Duane up and
down

No thanks I dont drink Duane replied and returned their scrutiny
with interest Hows tricks in the Big Bend

Both men stared It had taken only a close glance for Duane to recognize
a type of ruffian most frequently met along the river These strangers
had that stamp and their surprise proved he was right Here the
innkeeper showed signs of uneasiness and seconded the surprise of his
customers No more was said at the instant and the two rather hurriedly
went out

Say boss do you know those fellows Duane asked the innkeeper

Nope

Which way did they come

Now I think of it them fellers rid in from both corners today he
replied and he put both hands on the bar and looked at Duane They
nooned heah comin from Bradford they said an trailed in after the
stage

When Duane returned to the sittingroom Colonel Longstreth was absent
also several of the other passengers Miss Ruth sat in the chair he had
vacated and across the table from her sat Miss Longstreth Duane went
directly to them

Excuse me said Duane addressing them I want to tell you there are
a couple of roughlooking men here Ive just seen them They mean
evil Tell your father to be careful Lock your doorsbar your windows
tonight

Oh cried Ruth very low Ray do you hear

Thank you well be careful said Miss Longstreth gracefully The
rich color had faded in her cheek I saw those men watching you
from that door They had such bright black eyes Is there really
dangerhere

I think so was Duanes reply

Soft swift steps behind him preceded a harsh voice Hands up

No man quicker than Duane to recognize the intent in those words His
hands shot up Miss Ruth uttered a little frightened cry and sank into
her chair Miss Longstreth turned white her eyes dilated Both girls
were staring at some one behind Duane

Turn around ordered the harsh voice

The big dark stranger the bearded one who had whispered to his comrade
in the barroom and asked Duane to drink had him covered with a cocked
gun He strode forward his eyes gleaming pressed the gun against him
and with his other hand dove into his inside coat pocket and tore out
his roll of bills Then he reached low at Duanes hip felt his gun and
took it Then he slapped the other hip evidently in search of another
weapon That done he backed away wearing an expression of fiendish
satisfaction that made Duane think he was only a common thief a novice
at this kind of game

His comrade stood in the door with a gun leveled at two other men who
stood there frightened speechless

Git a move on Bill called this fellow and he took a hasty glance
backward A stamp of hoofs came from outside Of course the robbers had
horses waiting The one called Bill strode across the room and with
brutal careless haste began to prod the two men with his weapon and to
search them The robber in the doorway called Rustle and disappeared

Duane wondered where the innkeeper was and Colonel Longstreth and the
other two passengers The bearded robber quickly got through with his
searching and from his growls Duane gathered he had not been well
remunerated Then he wheeled once more Duane had not moved a muscle
stood perfectly calm with his arms high The robber strode back with his
bloodshot eyes fastened upon the girls Miss Longstreth never flinched
but the little girl appeared about to faint

Dont yap there he said low and hard He thrust the gun close to
Ruth Then Duane knew for sure that he was no knight of the road but a
plain cutthroat robber Danger always made Duane exult in a kind of cold
glow But now something hot worked within him He had a little gun in
his pocket The robber had missed it And he began to calculate chances

Any money jewelry diamonds ordered the ruffian fiercely

Miss Ruth collapsed Then he made at Miss Longstreth She stood with
her hands at her breast Evidently the robber took this position to
mean that she had valuables concealed there But Duane fancied she had
instinctively pressed her hands against a throbbing heart

Come out with it he said harshly reaching for her

Dont dare touch me she cried her eyes ablaze She did not move She
had nerve

It made Duane thrill He saw he was going to get a chance Waiting had
been a science with him But here it was hard Miss Ruth had fainted
and that was well Miss Longstreth had fight in her which fact helped
Duane yet made injury possible to her She eluded two lunges the man
made at her Then his rough hand caught her waist and with one pull
ripped it asunder exposing her beautiful shoulder white as snow

She cried out The prospect of being robbed or even killed had not
shaken Miss Longstreths nerve as had this brutal tearing off of half
her waist

The ruffian was only turned partially away from Duane For himself
he could have waited no longer But for her That gun was still held
dangerously upward close to her Duane watched only that Then a bellow
made him jerk his head Colonel Longstreth stood in the doorway in a
magnificent rage He had no weapon Strange how he showed no fear He
bellowed something again

Duanes shifting glance caught the robbers sudden movement It was
a kind of start He seemed stricken Duane expected him to shoot
Longstreth Instead the hand that clutched Miss Longstreths torn waist
loosened its hold The other hand with its cocked weapon slowly dropped
till it pointed to the floor That was Duanes chance

Swift as a flash he drew his gun and fired Thud went his bullet and
he could not tell on the instant whether it hit the robber or went into
the ceiling Then the robbers gun boomed harmlessly He fell with blood
spurting over his face Duane realized he had hit him but the small
bullet had glanced

Miss Longstreth reeled and might have fallen had Duane not supported
her It was only a few steps to a couch to which he half led half
carried her Then he rushed out of the room across the patio through
the bar to the yard Nevertheless he was cautious In the gloom stood a
saddled horse probably the one belonging to the fellow he had shot
His comrade had escaped Returning to the sittingroom Duane found a
condition approaching pandemonium

The innkeeper rushed in pitchfork in hands Evidently he had been out
at the barn He was now shouting to find out what had happened Joel
the stagedriver was trying to quiet the men who had been robbed The
woman wife of one of the men had come in and she had hysterics The
girls were still and white The robber Bill lay where he had fallen and
Duane guessed he had made a fair shot after all And lastly the thing
that struck Duane most of all was Longstreths rage He never saw such
passion Like a caged lion Longstreth stalked and roared There came a
quieter moment in which the innkeeper shrilly protested

Man whatre you ravin aboot Nobodys hurt an thets lucky I swear
to God I hadnt nothin to do with them fellers

I ought to kill you anyhow replied Longstreth And his voice now
astounded Duane it was so full of power

Upon examination Duane found that his bullet had furrowed the robbers
temple torn a great piece out of his scalp and as Duane had guessed
had glanced He was not seriously injured and already showed signs of
returning consciousness

Drag him out of here ordered Longstreth and he turned to his
daughter

Before the innkeeper reached the robber Duane had secured the money and
gun taken from him and presently recovered the property of the other
men Joel helped the innkeeper carry the injured man somewhere outside

Miss Longstreth was sitting white but composed upon the couch where lay
Miss Ruth who evidently had been carried there by the Colonel Duane
did not think she had wholly lost consciousness and now she lay very
still with eyes dark and shadowy her face pallid and wet The Colonel
now that he finally remembered his womenfolk seemed to be gentle and
kind He talked soothingly to Miss Ruth made light of the adventure
said she must learn to have nerve out here where things happened

Can I be of any service asked Duane solicitously

Thanks I guess theres nothing you can do Talk to these frightened
girls while I go see whats to be done with that thickskulled robber
he replied and telling the girls that there was no more danger he
went out

Miss Longstreth sat with one hand holding her torn waist in place the
other she extended to Duane He took it awkwardly and he felt a strange
thrill

You saved my life she said in grave sweet seriousness

No no Duane exclaimed He might have struck you hurt you but no
more

I saw murder in his eyes He thought I had jewels under my dress I
couldnt bear his touch The beast Id have fought Surely my life was
in peril

Did you kill him asked Miss Ruth who lay listening

Oh no Hes not badly hurt

Im very glad hes alive said Miss Longstreth shuddering

My intention was bad enough Duane went on It was a ticklish place
for me You see he was half drunk and I was afraid his gun might go
off Fool careless he was

Yet you say you didnt save me Miss Longstreth returned quickly

Well let it go at that Duane responded I saved you something

Tell me all about it asked Miss Ruth who was fast recovering

Rather embarrassed Duane briefly told the incident from his point of
view

Then you stood there all the time with your hands up thinking of
nothingwatching for nothing except a little moment when you might draw
your gun asked Miss Ruth

I guess thats about it he replied

Cousin said Miss Longstreth thoughtfully it was fortunate for us
that this gentleman happened to be here Papa scoutslaughs at danger
He seemed to think there was no danger Yet he raved after it came

Go with us all the way to Fairdaleplease asked Miss Ruth sweetly
offering her hand I am Ruth Herbert And this is my cousin Ray
Longstreth

Im traveling that way replied Duane in great confusion He did not
know how to meet the situation

Colonel Longstreth returned then and after bidding Duane a good night
which seemed rather curt by contrast to the graciousness of the girls
he led them away

Before going to bed Duane went outside to take a look at the injured
robber and perhaps to ask him a few questions To Duanes surprise he
was gone and so was his horse The innkeeper was dumfounded He said
that he left the fellow on the floor in the barroom

Had he come to inquired Duane

Sure He asked for whisky

Did he say anything else

Not to me I heard him talkin to the father of them girls

You mean Colonel Longstreth

I reckon He sure was some riled wasnt he Jest as if I was to blame
fer that twobit of a holdup

What did you make of the old gents rage asked Duane watching the
innkeeper He scratched his head dubiously He was sincere and Duane
believed in his honesty

Wal Im doggoned if I know what to make of it But I reckon hes
either crazy or got more nerve than most Texans

More nerve maybe Duane replied Show me a bed now innkeeper

Once in bed in the dark Duane composed himself to think over the
several events of the evening He called up the details of the holdup
and carefully revolved them in mind The Colonels wrath under
circumstances where almost any Texan would have been cool nonplussed
Duane and he put it down to a choleric temperament He pondered long on
the action of the robber when Longstreths bellow of rage burst in
upon him This ruffian as bold and mean a type as Duane had ever
encountered had from some cause or other been startled From whatever
point Duane viewed the mans strange indecision he could come to
only one conclusionhis start his check his fear had been that of
recognition Duane compared this effect with the suddenly acquired sense
he had gotten of Colonel Longstreths powerful personality Why had that
desperate robber lowered his gun and stood paralyzed at sight and sound
of the Mayor of Fairdale This was not answerable There might have been
a number of reasons all to Colonel Longstreths credit but Duane
could not understand Longstreth had not appeared to see danger for his
daughter even though she had been roughly handled and had advanced in
front of a cocked gun Duane probed deep into this singular fact and he
brought to bear on the thing all his knowledge and experience of
violent Texas life And he found that the instant Colonel Longstreth
had appeared on the scene there was no further danger threatening his
daughter Why That likewise Duane could not answer Then his rage
Duane concluded had been solely at the idea of HIS daughter being
assaulted by a robber This deduction was indeed a thoughtdisturber
but Duane put it aside to crystallize and for more careful
consideration

Next morning Duane found that the little town was called Sanderson It
was larger than he had at first supposed He walked up the main street
and back again Just as he arrived some horsemen rode up to the inn and
dismounted And at this juncture the Longstreth party came out Duane
heard Colonel Longstreth utter an exclamation Then he saw him shake
hands with a tall man Longstreth looked surprised and angry and he
spoke with force but Duane could not hear what it was he said The
fellow laughed yet somehow he struck Duane as sullen until suddenly
he espied Miss Longstreth Then his face changed and he removed his
sombrero Duane went closer

Floyd did you come with the teams asked Longstreth sharply

Not me I rode a horse good and hard was the reply

Humph Ill have a word to say to you later Then Longstreth turned to
his daughter Ray heres the cousin Ive told you about You used to
play with him ten years agoFloyd Lawson Floyd my daughterand my
niece Ruth Herbert

Duane always scrutinized every one he met and now with a dangerous game
to play with a consciousness of Longstreths unusual and significant
personality he bent a keen and searching glance upon this Floyd Lawson

He was under thirty yet gray at his templesdark smoothshaven with
lines left by wildness dissipation shadows under dark eyes a mouth
strong and bitter and a square china reckless careless handsome
sinister face strangely losing the hardness when he smiled The grace
of a gentleman clung round him seemed like an echo in his mellow voice
Duane doubted not that he like many a young man had drifted out to
the frontier where rough and wild life had wrought sternly but had not
quite effaced the mark of good family

Colonel Longstreth apparently did not share the pleasure of his daughter
and his niece in the advent of this cousin Something hinged on this
meeting Duane grew intensely curious but as the stage appeared ready
for the journey he had no further opportunity to gratify it



CHAPTER XVI

Duane followed the stage through the town out into the open on to a
wide hardpacked road showing years of travel It headed northwest To
the left rose a range of low bleak mountains he had noted yesterday
and to the right sloped the mesquitepatched sweep of ridge and flat
The driver pushed his team to a fast trot which gait surely covered
ground rapidly

The stage made three stops in the forenoon one at a place where the
horses could be watered the second at a chuckwagon belonging to
cowboys who were riding after stock and the third at a small cluster
of adobe and stone houses constituting a hamlet the driver called
Longstreth named after the Colonel From that point on to Fairdale
there were only a few ranches each one controlling great acreage

Early in the afternoon from a ridgetop Duane sighted Fairdale a green
patch in the mass of gray For the barrens of Texas it was indeed a fair
sight But he was more concerned with its remoteness from civilization
than its beauty At that time in the early seventies when the vast
western third of Texas was a wilderness the pioneer had done wonders to
settle there and establish places like Fairdale

It needed only a glance for Duane to pick out Colonel Longstreths
ranch The house was situated on the only elevation around Fairdale and
it was not high nor more than a few minutes walk from the edge of the
town It was a low flatroofed structure made of red adobe bricks and
covered what appeared to be fully an acre of ground All was green about
it except where the fenced corrals and numerous barns or sheds showed
gray and red

Duane soon reached the shady outskirts of Fairdale and entered the
town with mingled feelings of curiosity eagerness and expectation The
street he rode down was a main one and on both sides of the street was
a solid row of saloons resorts hotels Saddled horses stood hitched
all along the sidewalk in two long lines with a buckboard and team here
and there breaking the continuity This block was busy and noisy

From all outside appearances Fairdale was no different from other
frontier towns and Duanes expectations were scarcely realized As the
afternoon was waning he halted at a little inn A boy took charge of his
horse Duane questioned the lad about Fairdale and gradually drew to the
subject most in mind

Colonel Longstreth has a big outfit eh

Reckon he has replied the lad Doan know how many cowboys Theyre
always comin and goin I aint acquainted with half of them

Much movement of stock these days

Stocks always movin he replied with a queer look

Rustlers

But he did not follow up that look with the affirmative Duane expected

Lively place I hearFairdale is

Aint so lively as Sanderson but its bigger

Yes I heard it was Fellow down there was talking about two cowboys
who were arrested

Sure I heered all about that Joe Bean an Brick Higginsthey belong
heah but they aint heah much Longstreths boys

Duane did not want to appear overinquisitive so he turned the talk
into other channels

After getting supper Duane strolled up and down the main street When
darkness set in he went into a hotel bought cigars sat around and
watched Then he passed out and went into the next place This was of
rough crude exterior but the inside was comparatively pretentious and
ablaze with lights It was full of men coming and goinga dustybooted
crowd that smelled of horses and smoke Duane sat down for a while with
wide eyes and open ears Then he hunted up the bar where most of the
guests had been or were going He found a great square room lighted by
six huge lamps a bar at one side and all the floorspace taken up
by tables and chairs This was the only gambling place of any size in
southern Texas in which he had noted the absence of Mexicans There was
some cardplaying going on at this moment Duane stayed in there for
a while and knew that strangers were too common in Fairdale to be
conspicuous Then he returned to the inn where he had engaged a room

Duane sat down on the steps of the dingy little restaurant Two men were
conversing inside and they had not noticed Duane

Laramie whats the strangers name asked one

He didnt say replied the other

Sure was a strappin big man Struck me a little odd he did No
cattleman him Howd you size him

Well like one of them cool easy quiet Texans whos been lookin for
a man for yearsto kill him when he found him

Right you are Laramie and between you an me I hope hes lookin
for Long

Ssh interrupted Laramie You must be half drunk to go talkie
that way

Thereafter they conversed in too low a tone for Duane to hear and
presently Laramies visitor left Duane went inside and making himself
agreeable began to ask casual questions about Fairdale Laramie was not
communicative

Duane went to his room in a thoughtful frame of mind Had Laramies
visitor meant he hoped some one had come to kill Longstreth Duane
inferred just that from the interrupted remark There was something
wrong about the Mayor of Fairdale Duane felt it And he felt also if
there was a crooked and dangerous man it was this Floyd Lawson The
innkeeper Laramie would be worth cultivating And last in Duanes
thoughts that night was Miss Longstreth He could not help thinking of
herhow strangely the meeting with her had affected him It made him
remember that longpast time when girls had been a part of his life
What a sad and dark and endless void lay between that past and the
present He had no right even to dream of a beautiful woman like Ray
Longstreth That conviction however did not dispel her indeed
it seemed perversely to make her grow more fascinating Duane grew
conscious of a strange unaccountable hunger a something that was like
a pang in his breast

Next day he lounged about the inn He did not make any overtures to
the taciturn proprietor Duane had no need of hurry now He contented
himself with watching and listening And at the close of that day he
decided Fairdale was what MacNelly had claimed it to be and that he was
on the track of an unusual adventure The following day he spent in much
the same way though on one occasion he told Laramie he was looking for
a man The innkeeper grew a little less furtive and reticent after that
He would answer casual queries and it did not take Duane long to learn
that Laramie had seen better daysthat he was now broken bitter and
hard Some one had wronged him

Several days passed Duane did not succeed in getting any closer to
Laramie but he found the idlers on the corners and in front of the
stores unsuspicious and willing to talk It did not take him long to
find out that Fairdale stood parallel with Huntsville for gambling
drinking and fighting The street was always lined with dusty saddled
horses the town full of strangers Money appeared more abundant than in
any place Duane had ever visited and it was spent with the abandon
that spoke forcibly of easy and crooked acquirement Duane decided
that Sanderson Bradford and Ord were but notorious outposts to this
Fairdale which was a secret center of rustlers and outlaws And what
struck Duane strangest of all was the fact that Longstreth was mayor
here and held court daily Duane knew intuitively before a chance
remark gave him proof that this court was a sham a farce And he
wondered if it were not a blind This wonder of his was equivalent to
suspicion of Colonel Longstreth and Duane reproached himself Then
he realized that the reproach was because of the daughter Inquiry had
brought him the fact that Ray Longstreth had just come to live with her
father Longstreth had originally been a planter in Louisiana where his
family had remained after his advent in the West He was a rich rancher
he owned half of Fairdale he was a cattlebuyer on a large scale Floyd
Lawson was his lieutenant and associate in deals

On the afternoon of the fifth day of Duanes stay in Fairdale he
returned to the inn from his usual stroll and upon entering was amazed
to have a roughlooking young fellow rush by him out of the door Inside
Laramie was lying on the floor with a bloody bruise on his face He did
not appear to be dangerously hurt

Bo Snecker He hit me and went after the cashdrawer said Laramie
laboring to his feet

Are you hurt much queried Duane

I guess not But Bo neednt to have soaked me Ive been robbed before
without that

Well Ill take a look after Bo replied Duane

He went out and glanced down the street toward the center of the town
He did not see any one he could take for the innkeepers assailant Then
he looked up the street and he saw the young fellow about a block away
hurrying along and gazing back

Duane yelled for him to stop and started to go after him Snecker broke
into a run Then Duane set out to overhaul him There were two motives
in Duanes actionone of anger and the other a desire to make a friend
of this man Laramie whom Duane believed could tell him much

Duane was light on his feet and he had a giant stride He gained
rapidly upon Snecker who turning this way and that could not get
out of sight Then he took to the open country and ran straight for
the green hill where Longstreths house stood Duane had almost caught
Snecker when he reached the shrubbery and trees and there eluded him
But Duane kept him in sight in the shade on the paths and up the
road into the courtyard and he saw Snecker go straight for Longstreths
house

Duane was not to be turned back by that singular as it was He did not
stop to consider It seemed enough to know that fate had directed him to
the path of this rancher Longstreth Duane entered the first open door
on that side of the court It opened into a corridor which led into a
plaza It had wide smooth stone porches and flowers and shrubbery in
the center Duane hurried through to burst into the presence of Miss
Longstreth and a number of young people Evidently she was giving a
little party

Lawson stood leaning against one of the pillars that supported the
porch roof at sight of Duane his face changed remarkably expressing
amazement consternation then fear

In the quick ensuing silence Miss Longstreth rose white as her dress
The young women present stared in astonishment if they were not equally
perturbed There were cowboys present who suddenly grew intent and
still By these things Duane gathered that his appearance must
be disconcerting He was panting He wore no hat or coat His big
gunsheath showed plainly at his hip

Sight of Miss Longstreth had an unaccountable effect upon Duane He was
plunged into confusion For the moment he saw no one but her

Miss LongstrethI cameto searchyour house panted Duane

He hardly knew what he was saying yet the instant he spoke he realized
that that should have been the last thing for him to say He had
blundered But he was not used to women and this darkeyed girl made
him thrill and his heart beat thickly and his wits go scattering

Search my house exclaimed Miss Longstreth and red succeeded the
white in her cheeks She appeared astonished and angry What for Why
how dare you This is unwarrantable

A manBo Sneckerassaulted and robbed Jim Laramie replied Duane
hurriedly I chased Snecker heresaw him run into the house

Here Oh sir you must be mistaken We have seen no one In the
absence of my father Im mistress here Ill not permit you to search

Lawson appeared to come out of his astonishment He stepped forward

Ray dont be bothered now he said to his cousin This fellows
making a bluff Ill settle him See here Mister you clear out

I want Snecker Hes here and Im going to get him replied Duane
quietly

Bah Thats all a bluff sneered Lawson Im on to your game You
just wanted an excuse to break in hereto see my cousin again When you
saw the company you invented that excuse Now be off or itll be the
worse for you

Duane felt his face burn with a tide of hot blood Almost he felt that
he was guilty of such motive Had he not been unable to put this Ray
Longstreth out of his mind There seemed to be scorn in her eyes now
And somehow that checked his embarrassment

Miss Longstreth will you let me search the house he asked

No

ThenI regret to sayIll do so without your permission

Youll not dare she flashed She stood erect her bosom swelling

Pardon me yes I will

Who are you she demanded suddenly

Im a Texas Ranger replied Duane

A TEXAS RANGER she echoed

Floyd Lawsons dark face turned pale

Miss Longstreth I dont need warrants to search houses said Duane
Im sorry to annoy you Id prefer to have your permission A ruffian
has taken refuge herein your fathers house Hes hidden somewhere
May I look for him

If you are indeed a ranger

Duane produced his papers Miss Longstreth haughtily refused to look at
them

Miss Longstreth Ive come to make Fairdale a safer cleaner better
place for women and children I dont wonder at your resentment But to
doubt meinsult me Some day you may be sorry

Floyd Lawson made a violent motion with his hands

All stuff Cousin go on with your party Ill take a couple of cowboys
and go with thisthis Texas Ranger

Thanks said Duane coolly as he eyed Lawson Perhaps youll be able
to find Snecker quicker than I could

What do you mean demanded Lawson and now he grew livid Evidently he
was a man of fierce quick passions

Dont quarrel said Miss Longstreth Floyd you go with him Please
hurry Ill be nervous tillthe mans found or youre sure theres not
one

They started with several cowboys to search the house They went through
the rooms searching calling out peering into dark places It struck
Duane more than forcibly that Lawson did all the calling He was
hurried too tried to keep in the lead Duane wondered if he knew his
voice would be recognized by the hiding man Be that as it might it was
Duane who peered into a dark corner and then with a gun leveled said
Come out

He came forth into the flarea tall slim darkfaced youth wearing
sombrero blouse and trousers Duane collared him before any of the
others could move and held the gun close enough to make him shrink But
he did not impress Duane as being frightened just then nevertheless he
had a clammy face the pallid look of a man who had just gotten over a
shock He peered into Duanes face then into that of the cowboy next to
him then into Lawsons and if ever in Duanes life he beheld relief
it was then That was all Duane needed to know but he meant to find out
more if he could

Whore you asked Duane quietly

Bo Snecker he said

Whatd you hide here for

He appeared to grow sullen

Reckoned Id be as safe in Longstreths as anywheres

Ranger whatll you do with him Lawson queried as if uncertain now
the capture was made

Ill see to that replied Duane and he pushed Snecker in front of him
out into the court

Duane had suddenly conceived the idea of taking Snecker before Mayor
Longstreth in the court

When Duane arrived at the hall where court was held there were other men
there a dozen or more and all seemed excited evidently news of Duane
had preceded him Longstreth sat at a table up on a platform Near
him sat a thickset grizzled man with deep eyes and this was Hanford
Owens county judge To the right stood a tall angular yellowfaced
fellow with a drooping sandy mustache Conspicuous on his vest was a
huge silver shield This was Gorsech one of Longstreths sheriffs
There were four other men whom Duane knew by sight several whose faces
were familiar and half a dozen strangers all dusty horsemen

Longstreth pounded hard on the table to be heard Mayor or not he was
unable at once to quell the excitement Gradually however it subsided
and from the last few utterances before quiet was restored Duane
gathered that he had intruded upon some kind of a meeting in the hall

Whatd you break in here for demanded Longstreth

Isnt this the court Arent you the Mayor of Fairdale interrogated
Duane His voice was clear and loud almost piercing

Yes replied Longstreth Like flint he seemed yet Duane felt his
intense interest

Ive arrested a criminal said Duane

Arrested a criminal ejaculated Longstreth You Whore you

Im a ranger replied Duane

A significant silence ensued

I charge Snecker with assault on Laramie and attempted robberyif not
murder Hes had a shady past here as this court will know if it keeps
a record

Whats this I hear about you Bo Get up and speak for yourself said
Longstreth gruffly

Snecker got up not without a furtive glance at Duane and he had
shuffled forward a few steps toward the Mayor He had an evil front but
not the boldness even of a rustler

It aint so Longstreth he began loudly I went in Laramies place
fer grub Some feller I never seen before come in from the hall an hit
Laramie an wrestled him on the floor I went out Then this big ranger
chased me an fetched me here I didnt do nothin This rangers
hankerin to arrest somebody Thets my hunch Longstreth

Longstreth said something in an undertone to Judge Owens and that
worthy nodded his great bushy head

Bo youre discharged said Longstreth bluntly Now the rest of you
clear out of here

He absolutely ignored the ranger That was his rebuff to Duanehis slap
in the face to an interfering ranger service If Longstreth was crooked
he certainly had magnificent nerve Duane almost decided he was above
suspicion But his nonchalance his air of finality his authoritative
assurancethese to Duanes keen and practiced eyes were in significant
contrast to a certain tenseness of line about his mouth and a slow
paling of his olive skin In that momentary lull Duanes scrutiny of
Longstreth gathered an impression of the mans intense curiosity

Then the prisoner Snecker with a cough that broke the spell of
silence shuffled a couple of steps toward the door

Hold on called Duane The call halted Snecker as if it had been a
bullet

Longstreth I saw Snecker attack Laramie said Duane his voice still
ringing What has the court to say to that

The court has this to say West of the Pecos well not aid any ranger
service We dont want you out here Fairdale doesnt need you

Thats a lie Longstreth retorted Duane Ive letters from Fairdale
citizens all begging for ranger service

Longstreth turned white The veins corded at his temples He appeared
about to burst into rage He was at a loss for quick reply

Floyd Lawson rushed in and up to the table The blood showed black and
thick in his face his utterance was incoherent his uncontrollable
outbreak of temper seemed out of all proportion to any cause he should
reasonably have had for anger Longstreth shoved him back with a curse
and a warning glare

Wheres your warrant to arrest Snecker shouted Longstreth

I dont need warrants to make arrests Longstreth youre ignorant of
the power of Texas Rangers

Youll come none of your damned ranger stunts out here Ill block
you

That passionate reply of Longstreths was the signal Duane had
been waiting for He had helped on the crisis He wanted to force
Longstreths hand and show the town his stand

Duane backed clear of everybody

Men I call on you all cried Duane piercingly I call on you to
witness the arrest of a criminal prevented by Longstreth Mayor of
Fairdale It will be recorded in the report to the AdjutantGeneral at
Austin Longstreth youll never prevent another arrest

Longstreth sat white with working jaw

Longstreth youve shown your hand said Duane in a voice that
carried far and held those who heard Any honest citizen of Fairdale
can now see whats plainyours is a damn poor hand Youre going to
hear me call a spade a spade In the two years youve been Mayor
youve never arrested one rustler Strange when Fairdales a nest for
rustlers Youve never sent a prisoner to Del Rio let alone to
Austin You have no jail There have been nine murders during your
officeinnumerable streetfights and holdups Not one arrest But you
have ordered arrests for trivial offenses and have punished these out
of all proportion There have been lawsuits in your courtsuits over
waterrights cattle deals property lines Strange how in these
lawsuits you or Lawson or other men close to you were always involved
Strange how it seems the law was stretched to favor your interest

Duane paused in his cold ringing speech In the silence both outside
and inside the hall could be heard the deep breathing of agitated men
Longstreth was indeed a study Yet did he betray anything but rage at
this interloper

Longstreth heres plain talk for you and Fairdale went on Duane I
dont accuse you and your court of dishonesty I say STRANGE Law here
has been a farce The motive behind all this laxity isnt plain to
meyet But I call your hand



CHAPTER XVII

Duane left the hall elbowed his way through the crowd and went down
the street He was certain that on the faces of some men he had seen
illconcealed wonder and satisfaction He had struck some kind of a hot
trait and he meant to see where it led It was by no means unlikely
that Cheseldine might be at the other end Duane controlled a mounting
eagerness But ever and anon it was shot through with a remembrance of
Ray Longstreth He suspected her father of being not what he pretended
He might very probably would bring sorrow and shame to this young
woman The thought made him smart with pain She began to haunt him
and then he was thinking more of her beauty and sweetness than of the
disgrace he might bring upon her Some strange emotion long locked
inside Duanes heart knocked to be heard to be let out He was
troubled

Upon returning to the inn he found Laramie there apparently none the
worse for his injury

How are you Laramie he asked

Reckon Im feelin as well as could be expected replied Laramie His
head was circled by a bandage that did not conceal the lump where he had
been struck He looked pale but was bright enough

That was a good crack Snecker gave you remarked Duane

I aint accusin Bo remonstrated Laramie with eyes that made Duane
thoughtful

Well I accuse him I caught himtook him to Longstreths court But
they let him go

Laramie appeared to be agitated by this intimation of friendship

See here Laramie went on Duane in some parts of Texas its policy
to be closemouthed Policy and healthpreserving Between ourselves I
want you to know I lean on your side of the fence

Laramie gave a quick start Presently Duane turned and frankly met his
gaze He had startled Laramie out of his habitual set taciturnity but
even as he looked the light that might have been amaze and joy faded out
of his face leaving it the same old mask Still Duane had seen enough
Like a bloodhound he had a scent

Talking about work Laramie whod you say Snecker worked for

I didnt say

Well say so now cant you Laramie youre powerful peevish today
Its that bump on your head Who does Snecker work for

When he works at all which sure aint often he rides for Longstreth

Humph Seems to me that Longstreths the whole circus round Fairdale
I was some sore the other day to find I was losing good money at
Longstreths faro game Sure if Id won I wouldnt have been soreha
ha But I was surprised to hear some one say Longstreth owned the Hope
So joint

He owns considerable property hereabouts replied Laramie
constrainedly

Humph again Laramie like every other fellow I meet in this town
youre afraid to open your trap about Longstreth Get me straight
Laramie I dont care a damn for Colonel Mayor Longstreth And for cause
Id throw a gun on him just as quick as on any rustler in Pecos

Talks cheap replied Laramie making light of his bluster but the
red was deeper in his face

Sure I know that Duane said And usually I dont talk Then its
not well known that Longstreth owns the Hope So

Reckon its known in Pecos all right But Longstreths name isnt
connected with the Hope So Blandy runs the place

That Blandy His faro games crooked or Im a locoed bronch Not that
we dont have lots of crooked farodealers A fellow can stand for them
But Blandys mean backhanded never looks you in the eyes That Hope
So place ought to be run by a good fellow like you Laramie

Thanks replied he and Duane imagined his voice a little husky
Didnt you hear I used to run it

No Did you Duane said quickly

I reckon I built the place made additions twice owned it for eleven
years

Well Ill be doggoned It was indeed Duanes turn to be surprised
and with the surprise came a glimmering Im sorry youre not there
now Did you sell out

No Just lost the place

Laramie was bursting for relief nowto talk to tell Sympathy had made
him soft

It was two years agotwo years last March he went on I was in a big
cattle deal with Longstreth We got the stockan my share eighteen
hundred head was rustled off I owed Longstreth He pressed me It come
to a lawsuitan Iwas ruined

It hurt Duane to look at Laramie He was white and tears rolled down
his cheeks Duane saw the bitterness the defeat the agony of the
man He had failed to meet his obligations nevertheless he had been
swindled All that he suppressed all that would have been passion had
the mans spirit not been broken lay bare for Duane to see He had now
the secret of his bitterness But the reason he did not openly accuse
Longstreth the secret of his reticence and fearthese Duane thought
best to try to learn at some later time

Hard luck It certainly was tough Duane said But youre a good
loser And the wheel turns Now Laramie heres what I need your
advice Ive got a little money But before I lose it I want to invest
some Buy some stock or buy an interest in some ranchers herd What I
want you to steer me on is a good square rancher Or maybe a couple of
ranchers if there happen to be two honest ones Ha ha No deals with
ranchers who ride in the dark with rustlers Ive a hunch Fairdale is
full of them Now Laramie youve been here for years Sure you must
know a couple of men above suspicion

Thank God I do he replied feelingly Frank Morton an Si Zimmer my
friends an neighbors all my prosperous days an friends still You
can gamble on Frank and Si But if you want advice from medont invest
money in stock now

Why

Because any new feller buyin stock these days will be rustled quicker
n he can say Jack Robinson The pioneers the new cattlementhese
are easy pickin for the rustlers Lord knows all the ranchers are easy
enough pickin But the new fellers have to learn the ropes They dont
know anythin or anybody An the old ranchers are wise an sore Theyd
fight if they

What Duane put in as he paused If they knew who was rustling the
stock

Nope

If they had the nerve

Not thet so much

What then Whatd make them fight

A leader

Howdy thar Jim boomed a big voice

A man of great bulk with a ruddy merry face entered the room

Hello Morton replied Laramie Id introduce you to my guest here
but I dont know his name

Haw Haw Thets all right Few men out hyar go by their right names

Say Morton put in Duane Laramie gave me a hunch youd be a good
man to tie to Now Ive a little money and before I lose it Id like to
invest it in stock

Morton smiled broadly

Im on the square Duane said bluntly If you fellows never size up
your neighbors any better than you have sized mewell you wont get
any richer

It was enjoyment for Duane to make his remarks to these men pregnant
with meaning Morton showed his pleasure his interest but his faith
held aloof

Ive got some money Will you let me in on some kind of deal Will you
start me up as a stockman with a little herd all my own

Wal stranger to come out flatfooted youd be foolish to buy cattle
now I dont want to take your money an see you lose out Better go
back across the Pecos where the rustlers aint so strong I havent had
moren twentyfive hundred herd of stock for ten years The rustlers let
me hang on to a breedin herd Kind of them aint it

Sort of kind All I hear is rustlers Morton replied Duane with
impatience You see I havent ever lived long in a rustlerrun county
Who heads the gang anyway

Morton looked at Duane with a curiously amused smile then snapped his
big jaw as if to shut in impulsive words

Look here Morton It stands to reason no matter how strong these
rustlers are how hidden their work however involved with supposedly
honest menthey CANT last

They come with the pioneers an theyll last till thars a single
steer left he declared

Well if you take that view of circumstances I just figure you as one
of the rustlers

Morton looked as if he were about to brain Duane with the butt of his
whip His anger flashed by then evidently as unworthy of him and
something striking him as funny he boomed out a laugh

Its not so funny Duane went on If youre going to pretend a yellow
streak what else will I think

Pretend he repeated

Sure I know men of nerve And here theyre not any different from
those in other places I say if you show anything like a lack of sand
its all bluff By nature youve got nerve There are a lot of men
around Fairdale whore afraid of their shadowsafraid to be out after
darkafraid to open their mouths But youre not one So I say if you
claim these rustlers will last youre pretending lack of nerve just to
help the popular idea along For they CANT last What you need out here
is some new blood Savvy what I mean

Wal I reckon I do he replied looking as if a storm had blown over
him Stranger Ill look you up the next time I come to town

Then he went out

Laramie had eyes like flint striking fire

He breathed a deep breath and looked around the room before his gaze
fixed again on Duane

Wal he replied speaking low Youve picked the right men Now who
in the hell are you

Reaching into the inside pocket of his buckskin vest Duane turned the
lining out A starshaped bright silver object flashed as he shoved it
pocket and all under Jims hard eyes

RANGER he whispered cracking the table with his fist You sure rung
true to me

Laramie do you know whos boss of this secret gang of rustlers
hereabouts asked Duane bluntly It was characteristic of him to
come sharp to the point His voicesomething deep easy cool about
himseemed to steady Laramie

No replied Laramie

Does anybody know went on Duane

Wal I reckon theres not one honest native who KNOWS

But you have your suspicions

We have

Give me your idea about this crowd that hangs round the saloonsthe
regulars

Jest a bad lot replied Laramie with the quick assurance of
knowledge Most of them have been here years Others have drifted in
Some of them work odd times They rustle a few steers steal rob
anythin for a little money to drink an gamble Jest a bad lot

Have you any idea whether Cheseldine and his gang are associated with
this gang here

Lord knows Ive always suspected them the same gang None of us ever
seen Cheseldinean thets strange when Knell Poggin Panhandle
Smith Blossom Kane and Fletcher they all ride here often No Poggin
doesnt come often But the others do For thet matter theyre around
all over west of the Pecos

Now Im puzzled over this said Duane Why do menapparently honest
menseem to be so closemouthed here Is that a fact or only my
impression

Its a sure fact replied Laramie darkly Men have lost cattle an
property in Fairdalelost them honestly or otherwise as hasnt been
proved An in some cases when they talkedhinted a littlethey was
found dead Apparently held up an robbed But dead Dead men dont talk
Thets why were close mouthed

Duane felt a dark somber sternness Rustling cattle was not
intolerable Western Texas had gone on prospering growing in spite of
the hordes of rustlers ranging its vast stretches but a cold secret
murderous hold on a little struggling community was something too
strange too terrible for men to stand long

The ranger was about to speak again when the clatter of hoofs
interrupted him Horses halted out in front and one rider got down
Floyd Lawson entered He called for tobacco

If his visit surprised Laramie he did not show any evidence But Lawson
showed rage as he saw the ranger and then a dark glint flitted from
the eyes that shifted from Duane to Laramie and back again Duane leaned
easily against the counter

Say that was a bad break of yours Lawson said If you come fooling
round the ranch again therell be hell

It seemed strange that a man who had lived west of the Pecos for ten
years could not see in Duane something which forbade that kind of talk
It certainly was not nerve Lawson showed men of courage were seldom
intolerant With the matchless nerve that characterized the great gunmen
of the day there was a cool unobtrusive manner a speech brief almost
gentle certainly courteous Lawson was a hotheaded Louisianian of
French extraction a man evidently who had never been crossed in
anything and who was strong brutal passionate which qualities in the
face of a situation like this made him simply a fool

Im saying again you used your ranger bluff just to get near Ray
Longstreth Lawson sneered Mind you if you come up there again
therell be hell

Youre right But not the kind you think Duane retorted his voice
sharp and cold

Ray Longstreth wouldnt stoop to know a dirty bloodtracker like you
said Lawson hotly He did not seem to have a deliberate intention
to rouse Duane the man was simply rancorous jealous Ill call
you right You cheap bluffer You fourflush You damned interfering
conceited ranger

Lawson Ill not take offense because you seem to be championing your
beautiful cousin replied Duane in slow speech But let me return
your compliment Youre a fine Southerner Why youre only a cheap
fourflushdamned bullheaded RUSTLER

Duane hissed the last word Then for him there was the truth in Lawsons
working passionblackened face

Lawson jerked moved meant to draw But how slow Duane lunged forward
His long arm swept up And Lawson staggered backward knocking table and
chairs to fall hard in a halfsitting posture against the wall

Dont draw warned Duane

Lawson git away from your gun yelled Laramie

But Lawson was crazed with fury He tugged at his hip his face corded
with purple welts malignant murderous Duane kicked the gun out of his
hand Lawson got up raging and rushed out

Laramie lifted his shaking hands

Whatd you wing him for he wailed He was drawin on you Kickin
men like him wont do out here

That bullheaded fool will roar and butt himself with all his gang
right into our hands Hes just the man Ive needed to meet Besides
shooting him would have been murder

Murder exclaimed Laramie

Yes for me replied Duane

That may be truewhoever you arebut if Lawsons the man you think he
is hell begin thet secret underground bizness Why Lawson wont sleep
of nights now He an Longstreth have always been after me

Laramie what are your eyes for demanded Duane Watch out And now
here See your friend Morton Tell him this game grows hot Together you
approach four or five men you know well and can absolutely trust I may
need your help

Then Duane went from place to place corner to corner bar to bar
watching listening recording The excitement had preceded him and
speculation was rife He thought best to keep out of it After dark he
stole up to Longstreths ranch The evening was warm the doors were
open and in the twilight the only lamps that had been lit were in
Longstreths big sittingroom at the far end of the house When a
buckboard drove up and Longstreth and Lawson alighted Duane was well
hidden in the bushes so well screened that he could get but a fleeting
glimpse of Longstreth as he went in For all Duane could see he
appeared to be a calm and quiet man intense beneath the surface with
an air of dignity under insult Duanes chance to observe Lawson was
lost They went into the house without speaking and closed the door

At the other end of the porch close under a window was an offset
between step and wall and there in the shadow Duane hid So Duane
waited there in the darkness with patience born of many hours of hiding

Presently a lamp was lit and Duane heard the swish of skirts

Somethings happened surely Ruth he heard Miss Longstreth say
anxiously Papa just met me in the hall and didnt speak He seemed
pale worried

Cousin Floyd looked like a thundercloud said Ruth For once he
didnt try to kiss me Somethings happened Well Ray this had been a
bad day

Oh dear Ruth what can we do These are wild men Floyd makes life
miserable for me And he teases you unmer

I dont call it teasing Floyd wants to spoon declared Ruth
emphatically Hed run after any woman

A fine compliment to me Cousin Ruth laughed Ray

I dont care replied Ruth stubbornly its so Hes mushy And when
hes been drinking and tries to kiss meI hate him

There were steps on the hall floor

Hello girls sounded out Lawsons voice minus its usual gaiety

Floyd whats the matter asked Ray presently I never saw papa as
he is tonight nor you soso worried Tell me what has happened

Well Ray we had a jar today replied Lawson with a blunt
expressive laugh

Jar echoed both the girls curiously

We had to submit to a damnable outrage added Lawson passionately
as if the sound of his voice augmented his feeling Listen girls Ill
tell youall about it He coughed cleared his throat in a way that
betrayed he had been drinking

Duane sunk deeper into the shadow of his covert and stiffening his
muscles for a protected spell of rigidity prepared to listen with all
acuteness and intensity Just one word from this Lawson inadvertently
uttered in a moment of passion might be the word Duane needed for his
clue

It happened at the town hall began Lawson rapidly Your father and
Judge Owens and I were there in consultation with three ranchers from
out of town Then that damned ranger stalked in dragging Snecker the
fellow who hid here in the house He had arrested Snecker for alleged
assault on a restaurantkeeper named Laramie Snecker being obviously
innocent he was discharged Then this ranger began shouting his
insults Law was a farce in Fairdale The court was a farce There
was no law Your fathers office as mayor should be impeached He
made arrests only for petty offenses He was afraid of the rustlers
highwaymen murderers He was afraid orhe just let them alone He used
his office to cheat ranchers and cattlemen in lawsuits All this the
ranger yelled for every one to hear A damnable outrage Your father
Ray insulted in his own court by a rowdy ranger

Oh cried Ray Longstreth in mingled distress and anger

The ranger service wants to rule western Texas went on Lawson These
rangers are all a low set many of them worse than the outlaws they
hunt Some of them were outlaws and gunfighters before they became
rangers This is one of the worst of the lot Hes keen intelligent
smooth and that makes him more to be feared For he is to be feared He
wanted to kill He would kill If your father had made the least move he
would have shot him Hes a coldnerved devilthe born gunman My God
any instant I expected to see your father fall dead at my feet

Oh Floyd The unspeakable ruffian cried Ray Longstreth
passionately

You see Ray this fellow like all rangers seeks notoriety He made
that play with Snecker just for a chance to rant against your father He
tried to inflame all Fairdale against him That about the lawsuits was
the worst Damn him Hell make us enemies

What do you care for the insinuations of such a man said Ray
Longstreth her voice now deep and rich with feeling After a moments
thought no one will be influenced by them Do not worry Floyd Tell
papa not to worry Surely after all these years he cant be injured in
reputation byby an adventurer

Yes he can be injured replied Floyd quickly The frontier is a
queer place There are many bitter men heremen who have failed at
ranching And your father has been wonderfully successful The ranger
has dropped poison and itll spread



CHAPTER XVIII

Strangers rode into Fairdale and other hardlooking customers new
to Duane if not to Fairdale helped to create a charged and waiting
atmosphere The saloons did unusual business and were never closed
Respectable citizens of the town were awakened in the early dawn by
rowdies carousing in the streets

Duane kept pretty close under cover during the day He did not entertain
the opinion that the first time he walked downstreet he would be a
target for guns Things seldom happened that way and when they did
happen so it was more accident than design But at night he was not
idle He met Laramie Morton Zimmer and others of like character a
secret club had been formed and all the members were ready for action
Duane spent hours at night watching the house where Floyd Lawson stayed
when he was not up at Longstreths At night he was visited or at least
the house was by strange men who were swift stealthy mysteriousall
that kindly disposed friends or neighbors would not have been Duane had
not been able to recognize any of these night visitors and he did
not think the time was ripe for a bold holdingup of one of them
Nevertheless he was sure such an event would discover Lawson or some
one in that house to be in touch with crooked men

Laramie was right Not twentyfour hours after his last talk with Duane
in which he advised quick action he was found behind the little bar of
his restaurant with a bullethole in his breast dead No one could be
found who had heard a shot It had been deliberate murder for upon the
bar had been left a piece of paper rudely scrawled with a pencil All
friends of rangers look for the same

This roused Duane His first move however was to bury Laramie None
of Laramies neighbors evinced any interest in the dead man or the
unfortunate family he had left Duane saw that these neighbors were held
in check by fear Mrs Laramie was ill the shock of her husbands
death was hard on her and she had been left almost destitute with five
children Duane rented a small adobe house on the outskirts of town and
moved the family into it Then he played the part of provider and nurse
and friend

After several days Duane went boldly into town and showed that he meant
business It was his opinion that there were men in Fairdale secretly
glad of a rangers presence What he intended to do was food for great
speculation A company of militia could not have had the effect upon the
wild element of Fairdale that Duanes presence had It got out that he
was a gunman lightning swift on the draw It was death to face him He
had killed thirty menwildest rumor of allit was actually said of him
he had the gunskill of Buck Duane or of Poggin

At first there had not only been great conjecture among the vicious
element but also a very decided checking of all kinds of action
calculated to be conspicuous to a keeneyed ranger At the tables at
the bars and loungingplaces Duane heard the remarks Whos thet ranger
after Whatll he do fust off Is he waitin fer somebody Whos goin
to draw on him fustan go to hell Jest about how soon will he be
found somewheres full of lead

When it came out somewhere that Duane was openly cultivating the honest
stayathome citizens to array them in time against the other element
then Fairdale showed its wolfteeth Several times Duane was shot at
in the dark and once slightly injured Rumor had it that Poggin the
gunman was coming to meet him But the lawless element did not rise up
in a mass to slay Duane on sight It was not so much that the enemies
of the law awaited his next move but just a slowness peculiar to
the frontier The ranger was in their midst He was interesting if
formidable He would have been welcomed at cardtables at the bars to
play and drink with the men who knew they were under suspicion There
was a rude kind of good humor even in their open hostility

Besides one ranger or a company of rangers could not have held the
undivided attention of these men from their games and drinks and
quarrels except by some decided move Excitement greed appetite were
rife in them Duane marked however a striking exception to the usual
run of strangers he had been in the habit of seeing Snecker had gone
or was under cover Again Duane caught a vague rumor of the coming of
Poggin yet he never seemed to arrive Moreover the goingson among the
habitues of the resorts and the cowboys who came in to drink and gamble
were unusually mild in comparison with former conduct This lull
however did not deceive Duane It could not last The wonder was that
it had lasted so long

Duane went often to see Mrs Laramie and her children One afternoon
while he was there he saw Miss Longstreth and Ruth ride up to the
door They carried a basket Evidently they had heard of Mrs Laramies
trouble Duane felt strangely glad but he went into an adjoining room
rather than meet them

Mrs Laramie Ive come to see you said Miss Longstreth cheerfully

The little room was not very light there being only one window and
the doors but Duane could see plainly enough Mrs Laramie lay
hollowchecked and haggard on a bed Once she had evidently been a
woman of some comeliness The ravages of trouble and grief were there to
read in her worn face it had not however any of the hard and bitter
lines that had characterized her husbands

Duane wondered considering that Longstreth had ruined Laramie how Mrs
Laramie was going to regard the daughter of an enemy

So youre Granger Longstreths girl queried the woman with her
bright black eyes fixed on her visitor

Yes replied Miss Longstreth simply This is my cousin Ruth
Herbert Weve come to nurse you take care of the children help you in
any way youll let us

There was a long silence

Well you look a little like Longstreth finally said Mrs Laramie
but youre not at ALL like him You must take after your mother Miss
Longstreth I dont know if I canif I ought accept anything from you
Your father ruined my husband

Yes I know replied the girl sadly Thats all the more reason you
should let me help you Pray dont refuse It willmean so much to me

If this poor stricken woman had any resentment it speedily melted in
the warmth and sweetness of Miss Longstreths manner Duanes idea
was that the impression of Ray Longstreths beauty was always swiftly
succeeded by that of her generosity and nobility At any rate she had
started well with Mrs Laramie and no sooner had she begun to talk to
the children than both they and the mother were won The opening of that
big basket was an event Poor starved little beggars Duanes feelings
seemed too easily roused Hard indeed would it have gone with Jim
Laramies slayer if he could have laid eyes on him then However Miss
Longstreth and Ruth after the nature of tender and practical girls did
not appear to take the sad situation to heart The havoc was wrought in
that household

The needs now were cheerfulness kindness help actionand these the
girls furnished with a spirit that did Duane good

Mrs Laramie who dressed this baby presently asked Miss Longstreth
Duane peeped in to see a dilapidated youngster on her knee That sight
if any other was needed completed his full and splendid estimate of Ray
Longstreth and wrought strangely upon his heart

The ranger replied Mrs Laramie

The ranger exclaimed Miss Longstreth

Yes hes taken care of us all sincesince Mrs Laramie choked

Oh So youve had no help but his replied Miss Longstreth hastily
No women Too bad Ill send some one Mrs Laramie and Ill come
myself

Itll be good of you went on the older woman You see Jim had
few friendsthat is right in town And theyve been afraid to help
usafraid theyd get what poor Jim

Thats awful burst out Miss Longstreth passionately A brave lot of
friends Mrs Laramie dont you worry any more Well take care of you
Here Ruth help me Whatever is the matter with babys dress

Manifestly Miss Longstreth had some difficulty in subduing her emotion

Why its on hind side before declared Ruth I guess Mr Ranger
hasnt dressed many babies

He did the best he could said Mrs Laramie Lord only knows what
would have become of us

Then he isis something more than a ranger queried Miss Longstreth
with a little break in her voice

Hes more than I can tell replied Mrs Laramie He buried Jim He
paid our debts He fetched us here He bought food for us He cooked for
us and fed us He washed and dressed the baby He sat with me the first
two nights after Jims death when I thought Id die myself Hes so
kind so gentle so patient He has kept me up just by being near
Sometimes Id wake from a doze an seeing him there Id know how
false were all these tales Jim heard about him and believed at first
Why he plays with the children justjust like any good man might When
he has the baby up I just cant believe hes a bloody gunman as they
say Hes good but he isnt happy He has such sad eyes He looks far
off sometimes when the children climb round him They love him His life
is sad Nobody need tell mehe sees the good in things Once he said
somebody had to be a ranger Well I say Thank God for a ranger like
him

Duane did not want to hear more so he walked into the room

It was thoughtful of you Duane said Womankind are needed here I
could do so little Mrs Laramie you look better already Im glad
And heres baby all clean and white Baby what a time I had trying to
puzzle out the way your clothes went on Well Mrs Laramie didnt I
tell youfriends would come So will the brighter side

Yes Ive more faith than I had replied Mrs Laramie Granger
Longstreths daughter has come to me There for a while after Jims
death I thought Id sink We have nothing How could I ever take care of
my little ones But Im gaining courage to

Mrs Laramie do not distress yourself any more said Miss Longstreth
I shall see you are well cared for I promise you

Miss Longstreth thats fine exclaimed Duane Its what Id
haveexpected of you

It must have been sweet praise to her for the whiteness of her face
burned out in a beautiful blush

And its good of you too Miss Herbert to come added Duane Let me
thank you both Im glad I have you girls as allies in part of my lonely
task here More than glad for the sake of this good woman and the little
ones But both of you be careful about coming here alone Theres
risk And now Ill be going Goodby Mrs Laramie Ill drop in again
tonight Goodby

Mr Ranger wait called Miss Longstreth as he went out She was
white and wonderful She stepped out of the door close to him

I have wronged you she said impulsively

Miss Longstreth How can you say that he returned

I believed what my father and Floyd Lawson said about you Now I seeI
wronged you

You make me very glad But Miss Longstreth please dont speak of
wronging me I have been aa gunman I am a rangerand much said of me
is true My duty is hard on otherssometimes on those who are innocent
alas But God knows that duty is hard too on me

I did wrong you If you entered my home again I would think it an
honor I

Pleaseplease dont Miss Longstreth interrupted Duane

But sir my conscience flays me she went on There was no other
sound like her voice Will you take my hand Will you forgive me

She gave it royally while the other was there pressing at her breast
Duane took the proffered hand He did not know what else to do

Then it seemed to dawn upon him that there was more behind this white
sweet noble intensity of her than just the making amends for a fancied
or real wrong Duane thought the man did not live on earth who could
have resisted her then

I honor you for your goodness to this unfortunate woman she said and
now her speech came swiftly When she was all alone and helpless you
were her friend It was the deed of a man But Mrs Laramie isnt the
only unfortunate woman in the world I too am unfortunate Ah how
I may soon need a friend Will you be my friend Im so alone Im
terribly worried I fearI fearOh surely Ill need a friend
soonsoon Oh Im afraid of what youll find out sooner or later I
want to help you Let us save life if not honor Must I stand aloneall
alone Will youwill you be Her voice failed

It seemed to Duane that she must have discovered what he had begun to
suspectthat her father and Lawson were not the honest ranchers they
pretended to be Perhaps she knew more Her appeal to Duane shook him
deeply He wanted to help her more than he had ever wanted anything And
with the meaning of the tumultuous sweetness she stirred in him there
came realization of a dangerous situation

I must be true to my duty he said hoarsely

If you knew me youd know I could never ask you to be false to it

Well thenIll do anything for you

Oh thank you Im ashamed that I believed my cousin Floyd He liedhe
lied Im all in the dark strangely distressed My father wants me to
go back home Floyd is trying to keep me here Theyve quarreled Oh I
know something dreadful will happen I know Ill need you ififWill
you help me

Yes replied Duane and his look brought the blood to her face



CHAPTER XIX

After supper Duane stole out for his usual evenings spying The night
was dark without starlight and a stiff wind rustled the leaves Duane
bent his steps toward the Longstreths ranchhouse He had so much to
think about that he never knew where the time went This night when he
reached the edge of the shrubbery he heard Lawsons wellknown footsteps
and saw Longstreths door open flashing a broad bar of light in the
darkness Lawson crossed the threshold the door closed and all was
dark again outside Not a ray of light escaped from the window

Little doubt there was that his talk with Longstreth would be
interesting to Duane He tiptoed to the door and listened but could
hear only a murmur of voices Besides that position was too risky He
went round the corner of the house

This side of the big adobe house was of much older construction than
the back and larger part There was a narrow passage between the houses
leading from the outside through to the patio

This passage now afforded Duane an opportunity and he decided to
avail himself of it in spite of the very great danger Crawling on very
stealthily he got under the shrubbery to the entrance of the passage
In the blackness a faint streak of light showed the location of a crack
in the wall He had to slip in sidewise It was a tight squeeze but he
entered without the slightest noise As he progressed the passage grew
a very little wider in that direction and that fact gave rise to the
thought that in case of a necessary and hurried exit he would do best by
working toward the patio It seemed a good deal of time was consumed in
reaching a vantagepoint When he did get there the crack he had marked
was a foot over his head There was nothing to do but find toeholes in
the crumbling walls and by bracing knees on one side back against the
other hold himself up Once with his eye there he did not care what risk
he ran Longstreth appeared disturbed he sat stroking his mustache his
brow was clouded Lawsons face seemed darker more sullen yet lighted
by some indomitable resolve

Well settle both deals tonight Lawson was saying Thats what I
came for

But suppose I dont choose to talk here protested Longstreth
impatiently I never before made my house a place to

Weve waited long enough This places as good as any Youve lost your
nerve since that ranger hit the town First now will you give Ray to
me

Floyd you talk like a spoiled boy Give Ray to you Why shes a
woman and Im finding out that shes got a mind of her own I told you
I was willing for her to marry you I tried to persuade her But Ray
hasnt any use for you now She liked you at first But now she doesnt
So what can I do

You can make her marry me replied Lawson

Make that girl do what she doesnt want to It couldnt be done even if
I tried And I dont believe Ill try I havent the highest opinion
of you as a prospective soninlaw Floyd But if Ray loved you I would
consent Wed all go away together before this damned miserable business
is out Then shed never know And maybe you might be more like you used
to be before the West ruined you But as matters stand you fight your
own game with her And Ill tell you now youll lose

Whatd you want to let her come out here for demanded Lawson hotly
It was a dead mistake Ive lost my head over her Ill have her or
die Dont you think if she was my wife Id soon pull myself together
Since she came weve none of us been right And the gang has put up a
holler No Longstreth weve got to settle things tonight

Well we can settle what Rays concerned in right now replied
Longstreth rising Come on well ask her See where you stand

They went out leaving the door open Duane dropped down to rest himself
and to wait He would have liked to hear Miss Longstreths answer But
he could guess what it would be Lawson appeared to be all Duane had
thought him and he believed he was going to find out presently that he
was worse

The men seemed to be absent a good while though that feeling might have
been occasioned by Duanes thrilling interest and anxiety Finally
he heard heavy steps Lawson came in alone He was leadenfaced
humiliated Then something abject in him gave place to rage He strode
the room he cursed Then Longstreth returned now appreciably calmer
Duane could not but decide that he felt relief at the evident rejection
of Lawsons proposal

Dont fuss about it Floyd he said You see I cant help it Were
pretty wild out here but I cant rope my daughter and give her to you
as I would an unruly steer

Longstreth I can MAKE her marry me declared Lawson thickly

How

You know the hold I got on youthe deal that made you boss of this
rustler gang

It isnt likely Id forget replied Longstreth grimly

I can go to Ray tell her that make her believe Id tell it
broadcasttell this rangerunless shed marry me

Lawson spoke breathlessly with haggard face and shadowed eyes He had
no shame He was simply in the grip of passion Longstreth gazed with
dark controlled fury at this relative In that look Duane saw a strong
unscrupulous man fallen into evil ways but still a man It betrayed
Lawson to be the wild and passionate weakling Duane seemed to see also
how during all the years of association this strong man had upheld
the weak one But that time had gone for ever both in intent on
Longstreths part and in possibility Lawson like the great majority
of evil and unrestrained men on the border had reached a point where
influence was futile Reason had degenerated He saw only himself

But Floyd Rays the one person on earth who must never know Im a
rustler a thief a redhanded ruler of the worst gang on the border
replied Longstreth impressively

Floyd bowed his head at that as if the significance had just occurred
to him But he was not long at a loss

Shes going to find it out sooner or later I tell you she knows now
theres something wrong out here Shes got eyes Mark what I say

Ray has changed I know But she hasnt any idea yet that her daddys
a boss rustler Rays concerned about what she calls my duty as mayor
Also I think shes not satisfied with my explanations in regard to
certain property

Lawson halted in his restless walk and leaned against the stone
mantelpiece He had his hands in his pockets He squared himself as if
this was his last stand He looked desperate but on the moment showed
an absence of his usual nervous excitement

Longstreth that may well be true he said No doubt all you say is
true But it doesnt help me I want the girl If I dont get herI
reckon well all go to hell

He might have meant anything probably meant the worst He certainly
had something more in mind Longstreth gave a slight start barely
perceptible like the switch of an awakening tiger He sat there head
down stroking his mustache Almost Duane saw his thought He had long
experience in reading men under stress of such emotion He had no means
to vindicate his judgment but his conviction was that Longstreth right
then and there decided that the thing to do was to kill Lawson
For Duanes part he wondered that Longstreth had not come to such a
conclusion before Not improbably the advent of his daughter had put
Longstreth in conflict with himself

Suddenly he threw off a somber cast of countenance and he began to
talk He talked swiftly persuasively yet Duane imagined he was talking
to smooth Lawsons passion for the moment Lawson no more caught the
fateful significance of a line crossed a limit reached a decree
decided than if he had not been present He was obsessed with himself
How Duane wondered had a man of his mind ever lived so long and gone
so far among the exacting conditions of the Southwest The answer was
perhaps that Longstreth had guided him upheld him protected him The
coming of Ray Longstreth had been the enteringwedge of dissension

Youre too impatient concluded Longstreth Youll ruin any chance
of happiness if you rush Ray She might be won If you told her who I am
shed hate you for ever She might marry you to save me but shed hate
you That isnt the way Wait Play for time Be different with her
Cut out your drinking She despises that Lets plan to sell out
herestock ranch propertyand leave the country Then youd have a
show with her

I told you weve got to stick growled Lawson The gang wont
stand for our going It cant be done unless you want to sacrifice
everything

You mean doublecross the men Go without their knowing Leave them
here to face whatever comes

I mean just that

Im bad enough but not that bad returned Longstreth If I cant
get the gang to let me off Ill stay and face the music All the same
Lawson did it ever strike you that most of the deals the last few years
have been YOURS

Yes If I hadnt rung them in there wouldnt have been any Youve had
cold feet and especially since this ranger has been here

Well call it cold feet if you like But I call it sense We reached
our limit long ago We began by rustling a few cattleat a time when
rustling was laughed at But as our greed grew so did our boldness Then
came the gang the regular trips the one thing and another till before
we knew itbefore I knew itwe had shady deals holdups and MURDERS
on our record Then we HAD to go on Too late to turn back

I reckon weve all said that None of the gang wants to quit They all
think and I think we cant be touched We may be blamed but nothing
can be proved Were too strong

Theres where youre dead wrong rejoined Longstreth emphatically
I imagined that once not long ago I was bullheaded Who would ever
connect Granger Longstreth with a rustler gang Ive changed my mind
Ive begun to think Ive reasoned out things Were crooked and we
cant last Its the nature of life even here for conditions to grow
better The wise deal for us would be to divide equally and leave the
country all of us

But you and I have all the stockall the gain protested Lawson

Ill split mine

I wontthat settles that added Lawson instantly

Longstreth spread wide his hands as if it was useless to try to convince
this man Talking had not increased his calmness and he now showed more
than impatience A dull glint gleamed deep in his eyes

Your stock and property will last a long timedo you lots of good when
this ranger

Bah hoarsely croaked Lawson The rangers name was a match applied to
powder Havent I told you hed be dead soonany timesame as Laramie
is

Yes you mentioned thethe supposition replied Longstreth
sarcastically I inquired too just how that very desired event was to
be brought about

The gang will lay him out

Bah retorted Longstreth in turn He laughed contemptuously

Floyd dont be a fool Youve been on the border for ten years Youve
packed a gun and youve used it Youve been with rustlers when they
killed their men Youve been present at many fights But you never in
all that time saw a man like this ranger You havent got sense enough
to see him right if you had a chance Neither have any of you The only
way to get rid of him is for the gang to draw on him all at once Then
hes going to drop some of them

Longstreth you say that like a man who wouldnt care much if he did
drop some of them declared Lawson and now he was sarcastic

To tell you the truth I wouldnt returned the other bluntly Im
pretty sick of this mess

Lawson cursed in amazement His emotions were all out of proportion to
his intelligence He was not at all quickwitted Duane had never seen a
vainer or more arrogant man

Longstreth I dont like your talk he said

If you dont like the way I talk you know what you can do replied
Longstreth quickly He stood up then cool and quiet with flash of
eyes and set of lips that told Duane he was dangerous

Well after all thats neither here nor there went on Lawson
unconsciously cowed by the other The thing is do I get the girl

Not by any means except her consent

Youll not make her marry me

No No replied Longstreth his voice still cold lowpitched

All right Then Ill make her

Evidently Longstreth understood the man before him so well that he
wasted no more words Duane knew what Lawson never dreamed of and that
was that Longstreth had a gun somewhere within reach and meant to use
it Then heavy footsteps sounded outside tramping upon the porch Duane
might have been mistaken but he believed those footsteps saved Lawsons
life

There they are said Lawson and he opened the door

Five masked men entered They all wore coats hiding any weapons A big
man with burly shoulders shook hands with Longstreth and the others
stood back

The atmosphere of that room had changed Lawson might have been a
nonentity for all he counted Longstreth was another mana stranger to
Duane If he had entertained a hope of freeing himself from this band
of getting away to a safer country he abandoned it at the very sight of
these men There was power here and he was bound

The big man spoke in low hoarse whispers and at this all the others
gathered around him close to the table There were evidently some signs
of membership not plain to Duane Then all the heads were bent over the
table Low voices spoke queried answered argued By straining his
ears Duane caught a word here and there They were planning and they
were brief Duane gathered they were to have a rendezvous at or near
Ord

Then the big man who evidently was the leader of the present
convention got up to depart He went as swiftly as he had come and was
followed by his comrades Longstreth prepared for a quiet smoke Lawson
seemed uncommunicative and unsociable He smoked fiercely and drank
continually All at once he straightened up as if listening

Whats that he called suddenly

Duanes strained ears were pervaded by a slight rustling sound

Must be a rat replied Longstreth

The rustle became a rattle

Sounds like a rattlesnake to me said Lawson

Longstreth got up from the table and peered round the room

Just at that instant Duane felt an almost inappreciable movement of the
adobe wall which supported him He could scarcely credit his senses But
the rattle inside Longstreths room was mingling with little dull thuds
of falling dirt The adobe wall merely dried mud was crumbling Duane
distinctly felt a tremor pass through it Then the blood gushed back to
his heart

What in the hell exclaimed Longstreth

I smell dust said Lawson sharply

That was the signal for Duane to drop down from his perch yet despite
his care he made a noise

Did you hear a step queried Longstreth

No one answered But a heavy piece of the adobe wall fell with a thud
Duane heard it crack felt it shake

Theres somebody between the walls thundered Longstreth

Then a section of the wall fell inward with a crash Duane began to
squeeze his body through the narrow passage toward the patio

Hear him yelled Lawson This side

No hes going that way yelled Longstreth

The tramp of heavy boots lent Duane the strength of desperation He
was not shirking a fight but to be cornered like a trapped coyote was
another matter He almost tore his clothes off in that passage The dust
nearly stifled him When he burst into the patio it was not a single
instant too soon But one deep gasp of breath revived him and he was up
gun in hand running for the outlet into the court Thumping footsteps
turned him back While there was a chance to get away he did not want to
fight He thought he heard someone running into the patio from the other
end He stole along and coming to a door without any idea of where it
might lead he softly pushed it open a little way and slipped in



CHAPTER XX

A low cry greeted Duane The room was light He saw Ray Longstreth
sitting on her bed in her dressinggown With a warning gesture to her
to be silent he turned to close the door It was a heavy door without
bolt or bar and when Duane had shut it he felt safe only for the
moment Then he gazed around the room There was one window with blind
closely drawn He listened and seemed to hear footsteps retreating
dying away

Then Duane turned to Miss Longstreth She had slipped off the bed half
to her knees and was holding out trembling hands She was as white as
the pillow on her bed She was terribly frightened Again with warning
hand commanding silence Duane stepped softly forward meaning to
reassure her

Oh she whispered wildly and Duane thought she was going to faint
When he got close and looked into her eyes he understood the strange
dark expression in them She was terrified because she believed he meant
to kill her or do worse probably worse Duane realized he must have
looked pretty hard and fierce bursting into her room with that big gun
in hand

The way she searched Duanes face with doubtful fearful eyes hurt him

Listen I didnt know this was your room I came here to get awayto
save my life I was pursued I was spying onon your father and
his men They heard me but did not see me They dont know who was
listening Theyre after me now

Her eyes changed from blank gulfs to dilating shadowing quickening
windows of thought

Then she stood up and faced Duane with the fire and intelligence of a
woman in her eyes

Tell me now You were spying on my father

Briefly Duane told her what had happened before he entered her room not
omitting a terse word as to the character of the men he had watched

My God So its that I knew something was terribly wrong herewith
himwith the placethe people And right off I hated Floyd Lawson Oh
itll kill me ififIts so much worse than I dreamed What shall I
do

The sound of soft steps somewhere near distracted Duanes attention
reminded him of her peril and now what counted more with him made
clear the probability of being discovered in her room

Ill have to get out of here whispered Duane

Wait she replied Didnt you say they were hunting for you

They sure are he returned grimly

Oh then you mustnt go They might shoot you before you got away
Stay If we hear them you can hide Ill turn out the light Ill meet
them at the door You can trust me Wait till all quiets down if we
have to wait till morning Then you can slip out

I oughtnt to stay I dont want toI wont Duane replied perplexed
and stubborn

But you must Its the only safe way They wont come here

Suppose they should Its an even chance Longstrethll search every
room and corner in this old house If they found me here I couldnt
start a fight You might be hurt Thenthe fact of my being here

Duane did not finish what he meant but instead made a step toward the
door White of face and dark of eye she took hold of him to detain him
She was as strong and supple as a panther But she need not have been
either resolute or strong for the clasp of her hand was enough to make
Duane weak

Up yet Ray came Longstreths clear voice too strained too eager to
be natural

No Im in bed reading Good night instantly replied Miss Longstreth
so calmly and naturally that Duane marveled at the difference between
man and woman Then she motioned for Duane to hide in the closet He
slipped in but the door would not close altogether

Are you alone went on Longstreths penetrating voice

Yes she replied Ruth went to bed

The door swung inward with a swift scrape and jar Longstreth half
entered haggard flamingeyed Behind him Duane saw Lawson and
indistinctly another man

Longstreth barred Lawson from entering which action showed control as
well as distrust He wanted to see into the room When he had glanced
around he went out and closed the door

Then what seemed a long interval ensued The house grew silent once
more Duane could not see Miss Longstreth but he heard her quick
breathing How long did she mean to let him stay hidden there Hard and
perilous as his life had been this was a new kind of adventure He
had divined the strange softness of his feeling as something due to the
magnetism of this beautiful woman It hardly seemed possible that he
who had been outside the pale for so many years could have fallen in
love Yet that must be the secret of his agitation

Presently he pushed open the closet door and stepped forth Miss
Longstreth had her head lowered upon her arms and appeared to be in
distress At his touch she raised a quivering face

I think I can go nowsafely he whispered

Go then if you must but you may stay till youre safe she replied

II couldnt thank you enough Its been hard on methis finding
outand you his daughter I feel strange I dont understand myself
well But I want you to knowif I were not an outlawa rangerId lay
my life at your feet

Oh You have seen soso little of me she faltered

All the same its true And that makes me feel more the trouble my
coming caused you

You will not fight my father

Not if I can help it Im trying to get out of his way

But you spied upon him

I am a ranger Miss Longstreth

And oh I am a rustlers daughter she cried Thats so much more
terrible than Id suspected It was tricky cattle deals I imagined he
was engaged in But only tonight I had strong suspicions aroused

How Tell me

I overheard Floyd say that men were coming tonight to arrange a
meeting for my father at a rendezvous near Ord Father did not want to
go Floyd taunted him with a name

What name queried Duane

It was Cheseldine

CHESELDINE My God Miss Longstreth why did you tell me that

What difference does that make

Your father and Cheseldine are one and the same whispered Duane
hoarsely

I gathered so much myself she replied miserably But Longstreth is
fathers real name

Duane felt so stunned he could not speak at once It was the girls part
in this tragedy that weakened him The instant she betrayed the secret
Duane realized perfectly that he did love her The emotion was like a
great flood

Miss Longstreth all this seems so unbelievable he whispered
Cheseldine is the rustler chief Ive come out here to get Hes only a
name Your father is the real man Ive sworn to get him Im bound by
more than law or oaths I cant break what binds me And I must disgrace
youwreck your lifer Why Miss Longstreth I believe II love
you Its all come in a rush Id die for you if I could How
fatalterriblethis is How things work out

She slipped to her knees with her hands on his

You wont kill him she implored If you care for meyou wont kill
him

No That I promise you

With a low moan she dropped her head upon the bed

Duane opened the door and stealthily stole out through the corridor to
the court

When Duane got out into the dark where his hot face cooled in the wind
his relief equaled his other feelings

The night was dark windy stormy yet there was no rain Duane hoped as
soon as he got clear of the ranch to lose something of the pain he felt
But long after he had tramped out into the open there was a lump in his
throat and an ache in his breast All his thought centered around Ray
Longstreth What a woman she had turned out to be He seemed to have
a vague hopeless hope that there might be there must be some way he
could save her



CHAPTER XXI

Before going to sleep that night Duane had decided to go to Ord and try
to find the rendezvous where Longstreth was to meet his men These men
Duane wanted even more than their leader If Longstreth or Cheseldine
was the brains of that gang Poggin was the executor It was Poggin who
needed to be found and stopped Poggin and his righthand men Duane
experienced a strange tigerish thrill It was thought of Poggin more
than thought of success for MacNellys plan Duane felt dubious over
this emotion

Next day he set out for Bradford He was glad to get away from Fairdale
for a while But the hours and the miles in no wise changed the new pain
in his heart The only way he could forget Miss Longstreth was to let
his mind dwell upon Poggin and even this was not always effective

He avoided Sanderson and at the end of the day and a half he arrived at
Bradford

The night of the day before he reached Bradford No 6 the mail and
express train going east was held up by trainrobbers the WellsFargo
messenger killed over his safe the mailclerk wounded the bags carried
away The engine of No 6 came into town minus even a tender and
engineer and fireman told conflicting stories A posse of railroad men
and citizens led by a sheriff Duane suspected was crooked was made up
before the engine steamed back to pick up the rest of the train Duane
had the sudden inspiration that he had been cudgeling his mind to
find and acting upon it he mounted his horse again and left Bradford
unobserved As he rode out into the night over a dark trail in the
direction of Ord he uttered a short grim sardonic laugh at the hope
that he might be taken for a trainrobber

He rode at an easy trot most of the night and when the black peak of
Ord Mountain loomed up against the stars he halted tied his horse and
slept until dawn He had brought a small pack and now he took his time
cooking breakfast When the sun was well up he saddled Bullet and
leaving the trail where his tracks showed plain in the ground he put
his horse to the rocks and brush He selected an exceedingly rough
roundabout and difficult course to Ord hid his tracks with the skill
of a longhunted fugitive and arrived there with his horse winded and
covered with lather It added considerable to his arrival that the man
Duane remembered as Fletcher and several others saw him come in the back
way through the lots and jump a fence into the road

Duane led Bullet up to the porch where Fletcher stood wiping his beard
He was hatless vestless and evidently had just enjoyed a morning
drink

Howdy Dodge said Fletcher laconically

Duane replied and the other man returned the greeting with interest

Jim my hoss s done up I want to hide him from any chance tourists as
might happen to ride up curiouslike

Haw haw haw

Duane gathered encouragement from that chorus of coarse laughter

Wal if them tourists aint too durned snooky the hossll be safe in
the dobe shack back of Bills here Feed thar too but youll hev to
rustle water

Duane led Bullet to the place indicated had care of his welfare and
left him there Upon returning to the tavern porch Duane saw the group
of men had been added to by others some of whom he had seen before
Without comment Duane walked along the edge of the road and wherever
one of the tracks of his horse showed he carefully obliterated it This
procedure was attentively watched by Fletcher and his companions

Wal Dodge remarked Fletcher as Duane returned thets safer n
prayin fer rain

Duanes reply was a remark as loquacious as Fletchers to the effect
that a long slow monotonous ride was conducive to thirst They all
joined him unmistakably friendly But Knell was not there and most
assuredly not Poggin Fletcher was no common outlaw but whatever his
ability it probably lay in execution of orders Apparently at that
time these men had nothing to do but drink and lounge around the tavern
Evidently they were poorly supplied with money though Duane observed
they could borrow a peso occasionally from the bartender Duane set
out to make himself agreeable and succeeded There was cardplaying
for small stakes idle jests of coarse nature much bantering among the
younger fellows and occasionally a mild quarrel All morning men came
and went until all told Duane calculated he had seen at least fifty
Toward the middle of the afternoon a young fellow burst into the saloon
and yelled one word

Posse

From the scramble to get outdoors Duane judged that word and the ensuing
action was rare in Ord

What the hell muttered Fletcher as he gazed down the road at a dark
compact bunch of horses and riders Fust time I ever seen thet in Ord
Were gettin popular like them camps out of Valentine Wish Phil was
here or Poggy Now all you gents keep quiet Ill do the talkin

The posse entered the town trotted up on dusty horses and halted in
a bunch before the tavern The party consisted of about twenty men
all heavily armed and evidently in charge of a cleancut leanlimbed
cowboy Duane experienced considerable satisfaction at the absence of
the sheriff who he had understood was to lead the posse Perhaps he was
out in another direction with a different force

Hello Jim Fletcher called the cowboy

Howdy replied Fletcher

At his short dry response and the way he strode leisurely out before
the posse Duane found himself modifying his contempt for Fletcher The
outlaw was different now

Fletcher weve tracked a man to all but three miles of this place
Tracks as plain as the nose on your face Found his camp Then he hit
into the brush an we lost the trail Didnt have no tracker with us
Think he went into the mountains But we took a chance an rid over the
rest of the way seein Ord was so close Anybody come in here late last
night or early this mornin

Nope replied Fletcher

His response was what Duane had expected from his manner and evidently
the cowboy took it as a matter of course He turned to the others of the
posse entering into a low consultation Evidently there was difference
of opinion if not real dissension in that posse

Didnt I tell ye this was a wildgoose chase comin way out here
protested an old hawkfaced rancher Them hoss tracks we follored aint
like any of them we seen at the watertank where the train was held up

Im not so sure of that replied the leader

Wal Guthrie Ive follored tracks all my life

But you couldnt keep to the trail this feller made in the brush

Gimme time an I could Thet takes time An heah you go hellbent
fer election But its a wrong lead out this way If youre right this
roadagent after he killed his pals would hev rid back right through
town An with them mailbags Supposin they was greasers Some
greasers has sense an when it comes to thievin theyre shore cute

But we sent got any reason to believe this robber who murdered the
greasers is a greaser himself I tell you it was a slick job done by no
ordinary sneak Didnt you hear the facts One greaser hopped the engine
an covered the engineer an fireman Another greaser kept flashin his
gun outside the train The big man who shoved back the cardoor an did
the killinhe was the real gent an dont you forget it

Some of the posse sided with the cowboy leader and some with the old
cattleman Finally the young leader disgustedly gathered up his bridle

Aw hell Thet sheriff shoved you off this trail Mebbe he hed reasons
Savvy thet If I hed a bunch of cowboys with meI tell you whatId
take a chance an clean up this hole

All the while Jim Fletcher stood quietly with his hands in his pockets

Guthrie Im shore treasurin up your friendly talk he said The
menace was in the tone not the content of his speech

You canan be damned to you Fletcher called Guthrie as the horses
started

Fletcher standing out alone before the others of his clan watched the
posse out of sight

Luck fer youall thet Poggy wasnt here he said as they disappeared
Then with a thoughtful mien he strode up on the porch and led Duane away
from the others into the barroom When he looked into Duanes face it
was somehow an entirely changed scrutiny

Dodge whered you hide the stuff I reckon I git in on this deal
seein I staved off Guthrie

Duane played his part Here was his a tiger after prey he seized it
First he coolly eyed the outlaw and then disclaimed any knowledge
whatever of the trainrobbery other than Fletcher had heard himself
Then at Fletchers persistence and admiration and increasing show of
friendliness he laughed occasionally and allowed himself to swell
with pride though still denying Next he feigned a lack of consistent
willpower and seemed to be wavering under Fletchers persuasion and
grew silent then surly Fletcher evidently sure of ultimate victory
desisted for the time being however in his solicitous regard and close
companionship for the rest of that day he betrayed the bent of his mind

Later when Duane started up announcing his intention to get his horse
and make for camp out in the brush Fletcher seemed grievously offended

Why dont you stay with me Ive got a comfortable dobe over here
Didnt I stick by you when Guthrie an his bunch come up Supposin I
hednt showed down a cold hand to him Youd be swingin somewheres now
I tell you Dodge it aint square

Ill square it I pay my debts replied Duane But I cant put up
here all night If I belonged to the gang it d be different

What gang asked Fletcher bluntly

Why Cheseldines

Fletchers beard nodded as his jaw dropped

Duane laughed I run into him the other day Knowed him on sight Sure
hes the kingpin rustler When he seen me an asked me what reason I
had for bein on earth or some such likewhy I up an told him

Fletcher appeared staggered

Who in allfired hell air you talkin about

Didnt I tell you once Cheseldine He calls himself Longstreth over
there

All of Fletchers face not covered by hair turned a dirty white
CheseldineLongstreth he whispered hoarsely Gord Almighty You
braced the Then a remarkable transformation came over the outlaw He
gulped he straightened his face he controlled his agitation But he
could not send the healthy brown back to his face Duane watching this
rude man marveled at the change in him the sudden checking movement
the proof of a wonderful fear and loyalty It all meant Cheseldine a
master of men

WHO AIR YOU queried Fletcher in a queer strained voice

You gave me a handle didnt you Dodge Thets as good as any Shore
it hits me hard Jim Ive been pretty lonely for years an Im gettin
in need of pals Think it over will you See you manana

The outlaw watched Duane go off after his horse watched him as he
returned to the tavern watched him ride out into the darknessall
without a word

Duane left the town threaded a quiet passage through cactus and
mesquite to a spot he had marked before and made ready for the night
His mind was so full that he found sleep aloof Luck at last was playing
his game He sensed the first slow heave of a mighty crisis The end
always haunting had to be sternly blotted from thought It was the
approach that needed all his mind

He passed the night there and late in the morning after watching trail
and road from a ridge he returned to Ord If Jim Fletcher tried to
disguise his surprise the effort was a failure Certainly he had not
expected to see Duane again Duane allowed himself a little freedom with
Fletcher an attitude hitherto lacking

That afternoon a horseman rode in from Bradford an outlaw evidently
well known and liked by his fellows and Duane beard him say before he
could possibly have been told the trainrobber was in Ord that the loss
of money in the holdup was slight Like a flash Duane saw the luck of
this report He pretended not to have heard

In the early twilight at an opportune moment he called Fletcher to him
and linking his arm within the outlaws he drew him off in a stroll to
a log bridge spanning a little gully Here after gazing around he took
out a roll of bills spread it out split it equally and without a word
handed one half to Fletcher With clumsy fingers Fletcher ran through
the roll

Five hundred he exclaimed Dodge thets damn handsome of you
considerin the job wasnt

Considerin nothin interrupted Duane Im makin no reference to
a job here or there You did me a good turn I split my pile If
thet doesnt make us pards good turns an money aint no use in this
country

Fletcher was won

The two men spent much time together Duane made up a short fictitious
history about himself that satisfied the outlaw only it drew forth a
laughing jest upon Duanes modesty For Fletcher did not hide his belief
that this new partner was a man of achievements Knell and Poggin and
then Cheseldine himself would be persuaded of this fact so Fletcher
boasted He had influence He would use it He thought he pulled a
stroke with Knell But nobody on earth not even the boss had any
influence on Poggin Poggin was concentrated ice part of the time all
the rest he was bursting hell But Poggin loved a horse He never loved
anything else He could be won with that black horse Bullet Cheseldine
was already won by Duanes monumental nerve otherwise he would have
killed Duane

Little by little the next few days Duane learned the points he longed
to know and how indelibly they etched themselves in his memory
Cheseldines hidingplace was on the far slope of Mount Ord in a deep
highwalled valley He always went there just before a contemplated job
where he met and planned with his lieutenants Then while they executed
he basked in the sunshine before one or another of the public places
he owned He was there in the Ord den now getting ready to plan the
biggest job yet It was a bankrobbery but where Fletcher had not as
yet been advised

Then when Duane had pumped the now amenable outlaw of all details
pertaining to the present he gathered data and facts and places covering
a period of ten years Fletcher had been with Cheseldine And herewith
was unfolded a history so dark in its bloody regime so incredible in
its brazen daring so appalling in its proof of the outlaws sweep and
grasp of the country from Pecos to Rio Grande that Duane was
stunned Compared to this Cheseldine of the Big Bend to this rancher
stockbuyer cattlespeculator propertyholder all the outlaws Duane
had ever known sank into insignificance The power of the man stunned
Duane the strange fidelity given him stunned Duane the intricate
inside working of his great system was equally stunning But when Duane
recovered from that the old terrible passion to kill consumed him
and it raged fiercely and it could not be checked If that redhanded
Poggin if that coldeyed deadfaced Knell had only been at Ord But
they were not and Duane with help of time got what he hoped was the
upper hand of himself



CHAPTER XXII

Again inaction and suspense dragged at Duanes spirit Like a leashed
hound with a keen scent in his face Duane wanted to leap forth when he
was bound He almost fretted Something called to him over the bold
wild brow of Mount Ord But while Fletcher stayed in Ord waiting for
Knell and Poggin or for orders Duane knew his game was again a waiting
one

But one day there were signs of the long quiet of Ord being broken A
messenger strange to Duane rode in on a secret mission that had to do
with Fletcher When he went away Fletcher became addicted to thoughtful
moods and lonely walks He seldom drank and this in itself was a
striking contrast to former behavior The messenger came again Whatever
communication he brought it had a remarkable effect upon the outlaw
Duane was present in the tavern when the fellow arrived saw the few
words whispered but did not hear them Fletcher turned white with anger
or fear perhaps both and he cursed like a madman The messenger
a lean darkfaced hardriding fellow reminding Duane of the cowboy
Guthrie left the tavern without even a drink and rode away off to the
west This west mystified and fascinated Duane as much as the south
beyond Mount Ord Where were Knell and Poggin Apparently they were not
at present with the leader on the mountain After the messenger left
Fletcher grew silent and surly He had presented a variety of moods to
Duanes observation and this latest one was provocative of thought
Fletcher was dangerous It became clear now that the other outlaws
of the camp feared him kept out of his way Duane let him alone yet
closely watched him

Perhaps an hour after the messenger had left not longer Fletcher
manifestly arrived at some decision and he called for his horse Then
he went to his shack and returned To Duane the outlaw looked in shape
both to ride and to fight He gave orders for the men in camp to keep
close until he returned Then he mounted

Come here Dodge he called

Duane went up and laid a hand on the pommel of the saddle Fletcher
walked his horse with Duane beside him till they reached the log
bridge when he halted

Dodge Im in bad with Knell he said An it pears Im the cause
of friction between Knell an Poggy Knell never had any use fer me but
Poggys been square if not friendly The boss has a big deal on an
here its been held up because of this scrap Hes waitin over there on
the mountain to give orders to Knell or Poggy an neither ones
showin up Ive got to stand in the breach an I aint enjoyin the
prospects

Whats the trouble about Jim asked Duane

Reckon its a little about you Dodge said Fletcher dryly Knell
hadnt any use fer you thet day He aint got no use fer a man onless he
can rule him Some of the boys here hev blabbed before I edged in with
my say an theres hell to pay Knell claims to know somethin about
you thatll make both the boss an Poggy sick when he springs it But
hes keepin quiet Hard man to figger thet Knell Reckon youd better
go back to Bradford fer a day or so then camp out near here till I come
back

Why

Wal because there aint any use fer you to git in bad too

The gang will ride over here any day If theyre friendly Ill light a
fire on the hill there say three nights from tonight If you dont see
it thet night you hit the trail Ill do what I can Jim Fletcher sticks
to his pals So long Dodge

Then he rode away

He left Duane in a quandary This news was black Things had been
working out so well Here was a setback At the moment Duane did not
know which way to turn but certainly he had no idea of going back to
Bradford Friction between the two great lieutenants of Cheseldine Open
hostility between one of them and another of the chiefs righthand
men Among outlaws that sort of thing was deadly serious Generally such
matters were settled with guns Duane gathered encouragement even from
disaster Perhaps the disintegration of Cheseldines great band had
already begun But what did Knell know Duane did not circle around
the idea with doubts and hopes if Knell knew anything it was that this
stranger in Ord this new partner of Fletchers was no less than Buck
Duane Well it was about time thought Duane that he made use of his
name if it were to help him at all That name had been MacNellys hope
He had anchored all his scheme to Duanes fame Duane was tempted to
ride off after Fletcher and stay with him This however would hardly
be fair to an outlaw who had been fair to him Duane concluded to await
developments and when the gang rode in to Ord probably from their
various hidingplaces he would be there ready to be denounced by Knell
Duane could not see any other culmination of this series of events than
a meeting between Knell and himself If that terminated fatally for
Knell there was all probability of Duanes being in no worse situation
than he was now If Poggin took up the quarrel Here Duane accused
himself againtried in vain to revolt from a judgment that he was only
reasoning out excuses to meet these outlaws

Meanwhile instead of waiting why not hunt up Cheseldine in his
mountain retreat The thought no sooner struck Duane than he was
hurrying for his horse

He left Ord ostensibly toward Bradford but once out of sight he
turned off the road circled through the brush and several miles south
of town he struck a narrow grassgrown trail that Fletcher had told him
led to Cheseldines camp The horse tracks along this trail were not
less than a week old and very likely much more It wound between
low brushcovered foothills through arroyos and gullies lined with
mesquite cottonwood and scruboak

In an hour Duane struck the slope of Mount Ord and as he climbed he
got a view of the rolling blackspotted country partly desert partly
fertile with long bright lines of dry streambeds winding away to grow
dim in the distance He got among broken rocks and cliffs and here the
open downwardrolling land disappeared and he was hard put to it to
find the trail He lost it repeatedly and made slow progress Finally
he climbed into a region of all rock benches rough here smooth there
with only an occasional scratch of iron horseshoe to guide him Many
times he had to go ahead and then work to right or left till he found
his way again It was slow work it took all day and night found him
halfway up the mountain He halted at a little sidecanon with grass
and water and here he made camp The night was clear and cool at that
height with a darkblue sky and a streak of stars blinking across With
this day of action behind him he felt better satisfied than he had been
for some time Here on this venture he was answering to a call that
had so often directed his movements perhaps his life and it was one
that logic or intelligence could take little stock of And on this
night lonely like the ones he used to spend in the Nueces gorge and
memorable of them because of a likeness to that old hidingplace he
felt the pressing return of old haunting thingsthe past so long ago
wild flights dead facesand the places of these were taken by one
quiveringly alive white tragic with its dark intent speaking
eyesRay Longstreths


That last memory he yielded to until he slept

In the morning satisfied that he had left still fewer tracks than
he had followed up this trail he led his horse up to the head of the
canon there a narrow crack in low cliffs and with branches of cedar
fenced him in Then he went back and took up the trail on foot

Without the horse he made better time and climbed through deep clefts
wide canons over ridges up shelving slopes along precipicesa long
hard climbtill he reached what he concluded was a divide Going down
was easier though the farther he followed this dim and winding trail
the wider the broken battlements of rock Above him he saw the black
fringe of pinon and pine and above that the bold peak bare yellow
like a desert butte Once through a wide gateway between great
escarpments he saw the lower country beyond the range and beyond this
vast and clear as it lay in his sight was the great river that made the
Big Bend He went down and down wondering how a horse could follow that
broken trail believing there must be another better one somewhere into
Cheseldines hidingplace

He rounded a jutting corner where view had been shut off and presently
came out upon the rim of a high wall Beneath like a green gulf seen
through blue haze lay an amphitheater walled in on the two sides he
could see It lay perhaps a thousand feet below him and plain as all
the other features of that wild environment there shone out a big red
stone or adobe cabin white water shining away between great borders
and horses and cattle dotting the levels It was a peaceful beautiful
scene Duane could not help grinding his teeth at the thought of
rustlers living there in quiet and ease

Duane worked halfway down to the level and well hidden in a niche
he settled himself to watch both trail and valley He made note of the
position of the sun and saw that if anything developed or if he decided
to descend any farther there was small likelihood of his getting back to
his camp before dark To try that after nightfall he imagined would be
vain effort

Then he bent his keen eyes downward The cabin appeared to be a crude
structure Though large in size it had of course been built by
outlaws

There was no garden no cultivated field no corral Excepting for the
rude pile of stones and logs plastered together with mud the valley was
as wild probably as on the day of discovery Duane seemed to have been
watching for a long time before he saw any sign of man and this one
apparently went to the stream for water and returned to the cabin

The sun went down behind the wall and shadows were born in the darker
places of the valley Duane began to want to get closer to that cabin
What had he taken this arduous climb for He held back however trying
to evolve further plans

While he was pondering the shadows quickly gathered and darkened If he
was to go back to camp he must set out at once Still he lingered And
suddenly his wideroving eye caught sight of two horsemen riding up the
valley The must have entered at a point below round the huge abutment
of rock beyond Duanes range of sight Their horses were tired and
stopped at the stream for a long drink

Duane left his perch took to the steep trail and descended as fast
as he could without making noise It did not take him long to reach the
valley floor It was almost level with deep grass and here and there
clumps of bushes Twilight was already thick down there Duane marked
the location of the trail and then began to slip like a shadow through
the grass and from bush to bush He saw a bright light before he
made out the dark outline of the cabin Then he heard voices a merry
whistle a coarse song and the clink of iron cookingutensils He
smelled fragrant woodsmoke He saw moving dark figures cross the light
Evidently there was a wide door or else the fire was out in the open

Duane swerved to the left out of direct line with the light and thus
was able to see better Then he advanced noiselessly but swiftly toward
the back of the house There were trees close to the wall He would make
no noise and he could scarcely be seenif only there was no watchdog
But all his outlaw days he had taken risks with only his useless life
at stake now with that changed he advanced stealthy and bold as an
Indian He reached the cover of the trees knew he was hidden in their
shadows for at few paces distance he had been able to see only their
tops From there he slipped up to the house and felt along the wall with
his hands

He came to a little window where light shone through He peeped in He
saw a room shrouded in shadows a lamp turned low a table chairs He
saw an open door with bright flare beyond but could not see the
fire Voices came indistinctly Without hesitation Duane stole farther
alongall the way to the end of the cabin Peeping round he saw only
the flare of light on bare ground Retracing his cautious steps he
paused at the crack again saw that no man was in the room and then
he went on round that end of the cabin Fortune favored him There
were bushes an old shed a woodpile all the cover he needed at that
corner He did not even need to crawl

Before he peered between the rough corner of wall and the bush growing
close to it Duane paused a moment This excitement was different from
that he had always felt when pursued It had no bitterness no pain no
dread There was as much danger here perhaps more yet it was not the
same Then he looked

He saw a bright fire a redfaced man bending over it whistling while
he handled a steaming pot Over him was a roofed shed built against
the wall with two open sides and two supporting posts Duanes second
glance not so blinded by the sudden bright light made out other men
three in the shadow two in the flare but with backs to him

Its a smoother trail by long odds but aint so short as this one
right over the mountain one outlaw was saying

Whats eatin you Panhandle ejaculated another Blossom an me rode
from Faraway Springs where Poggin is with some of the gang

Excuse me Phil Shore I didnt see you come in an Boldt never said
nothin

It took you a long time to get here but I guess thats just as well
spoke up a smooth suave voice with a ring in it

Longstreths voiceCheseldines voice

Here they wereCheseldine Phil Knell Blossom Kane Panhandle Smith
Boldthow well Duane remembered the namesall here the big men of
Cheseldines gang except the biggestPoggin Duane had holed them and
his sensations of the moment deadened sight and sound of what was before
him He sank down controlled himself silenced a mounting exultation
then from a lessstrained position he peered forth again

The outlaws were waiting for supper Their conversation might have been
that of cowboys in camp ranchers at a roundup Duane listened with
eager ears waiting for the business talk that he felt would come All
the time he watched with the eyes of a wolf upon its quarry Blossom
Kane was the leanlimbed messenger who had so angered Fletcher Boldt
was a giant in stature dark bearded silent Panhandle Smith was the
redfaced cook merry profane a short bowlegged man resembling many
rustlers Duane had known particularly Luke Stevens And Knell who sat
there tall slim like a boy in build like a boy in years with
his pale smooth expressionless face and his cold gray eyes And
Longstreth who leaned against the wall handsome with his dark face
and beard like an aristocrat resembled many a rich Louisiana planter
Duane had met The sixth man sat so much in the shadow that he could not
be plainly discerned and though addressed his name was not mentioned

Panhandle Smith carried pots and pans into the cabin and cheerfully
called out If you gents air hungry fer grub dont look fer me to feed
you with a spoon

The outlaws piled inside made a great bustle and clatter as they sat to
their meal Like hungry men they talked little

Duane waited there awhile then guardedly got up and crept round to
the other side of the cabin After he became used to the dark again
he ventured to steal along the wall to the window and peeped in The
outlaws were in the first room and could not be seen

Duane waited The moments dragged endlessly His heart pounded
Longstreth entered turned up the light and taking a box of cigars
from the table he carried it out

Here you fellows go outside and smoke he said Knell come on in
now Lets get it over

He returned sat down and lighted a cigar for himself He put his
booted feet on the table

Duane saw that the room was comfortably even luxuriously furnished
There must have been a good trail he thought else how could all that
stuff have been packed in there Most assuredly it could not have come
over the trail he had traveled Presently he heard the men go outside
and their voices became indistinct Then Knell came in and seated
himself without any of his chiefs ease He seemed preoccupied and as
always cold

Whats wrong Knell Why didnt you get here sooner queried
Longstreth

Poggin damn him Were on the outs again

What for

Aw he neednt have got sore Hes breakin a new hoss over at Faraway
an you know him where a hoss s concerned That kept him I reckon more
than anythin

What else Get it out of your system so we can go on to the new job

Well it begins back a ways I dont know how long agoweeksa
stranger rode into Ord an got down easylike as if he owned the place
He seemed familiar to me But I wasnt sure We looked him over an I
left tryin to place him in my mind

Whatd he look like

Rangy powerful man white hair over his temples still hard face
eyes like knives The way he packed his guns the way he walked an
stood an swung his right hand showed me what he was You cant fool me
on the gunsharp An he had a grand horse a big black

Ive met your man said Longstreth

No exclaimed Knell It was wonderful to hear surprise expressed by
this man that did not in the least show it in his strange physiognomy
Knell laughed a short grim hollow laugh Boss this here big gent
drifts into Ord again an makes up to Jim Fletcher Jim you know is
easy led He likes men An when a posse come along trailin a blind
lead huntin the wrong way for the man who held up No 6 why Jimhe
up an takes this stranger to be the fly roadagent an cottons to him
Got money out of him sure An thats what stumps me more Whats this
mans game I happen to know boss that he couldnt have held up No
6

How do you know demanded Longstreth

Because I did the job myself

A dark and stormy passion clouded the chiefs face

Damn you Knell Youre incorrigible Youre unreliable Another break
like that queers you with me Did you tell Poggin

Yes Thats one reason we fell out He raved I thought he was goin to
kill me

Why did you tackle such a risky job without help or plan

It offered thats all An it was easy But it was a mistake I got
the country an the railroad hollerin for nothin I just couldnt help
it You know what idleness means to one of us You know also that this
very life breeds fatality Its wrongthats why I was born of good
parents an I know whats right Were wrong an we cant beat the
end thats all An for my part I dont care a damn when that comes

Fine wise talk from you Knell said Longstreth scornfully Go on
with your story

As I said Jim cottons to the pretender an they get chummy Theyre
together all the time You can gamble Jim told all he knew an then
some A little liquor loosens his tongue Several of the boys rode over
from Ord an one of them went to Poggin an says Jim Fletcher has a new
man for the gang Poggin you know is always ready for any new man
He says if one doesnt turn out good he can be shut off easy He rather
liked the way this new part of Jims was boosted Jim an Poggin always
hit it up together So until I got on the deal Jims pard was already in
the gang without Poggin or you ever seein him Then I got to figurin
hard Just where had I ever seen that chap As it turned out I never
had seen him which accounts for my bein doubtful Id never forget
any man Id seen I dug up a lot of old papers from my kit an went over
them Letters pictures clippins an all that I guess I had a pretty
good notion what I was lookin for an who I wanted to make sure of At
last I found it An I knew my man But I didnt spring it on Poggin
Oh no I want to have some fun with him when the time comes Hell be
wilder than a trapped wolf I sent Blossom over to Ord to get word from
Jim an when he verified all this talk I sent Blossom again with a
message calculated to make Jim hump Poggin got sore said hed wait for
Jim an I could come over here to see you about the new job Hed meet
me in Ord

Knell had spoken hurriedly and low now and then with passion His pale
eyes glinted like fire in ice and now his voice fell to a whisper

Who do you think Fletchers new man is

Who demanded Longstreth

BUCK DUANE

Down came Longstreths boots with a crash then his body grew rigid

That Nueces outlaw That twoshot aceofspades gunthrower who killed
Bland Alloway

An Hardin Knell whispered this last name with more feeling than the
apparent circumstance demanded

Yes and Hardin the best one of the Rim Rock fellowsBuck Duane

Longstreth was so ghastly white now that his black mustache seemed
outlined against chalk He eyed his grim lieutenant They understood
each other without more words It was enough that Buck Duane was there
in the Big Bend Longstreth rose presently and reached for a flask from
which he drank then offered it to Knell He waved it aside

Knell began the chief slowly as he wiped his lips I gathered you
have some grudge against this Buck Duane

Yes

Well dont be a fool now and do what Poggin or almost any of you men
woulddont meet this Buck Duane Ive reason to believe hes a Texas
Ranger now

The hell you say exclaimed Knell

Yes Go to Ord and give Jim Fletcher a hunch Hell get Poggin and
theyll fix even Buck Duane

All right Ill do my best But if I run into Duane

Dont run into him Longstreths voice fairly rang with the force of
its passion and command He wiped his face drank again from the flask
sat down resumed his smoking and drawing a paper from his vest pocket
he began to study it

Well Im glad thats settled he said evidently referring to the
Duane matter Now for the new job This is October the eighteenth On
or before the twentyfifth there will be a shipment of gold reach the
Ranchers Bank of Val Verde After you return to Ord give Poggin these
orders Keep the gang quiet You Poggin Kane Fletcher Panhandle
Smith and Boldt to be in on the secret and the job Nobody else Youll
leave Ord on the twentythird ride across country by the trail till you
get within sight of Mercer Its a hundred miles from Bradford to Val
Verdeabout the same from Ord Time your travel to get you near Val
Verde on the morning of the twentysixth You wont have to more than
trot your horses At two oclock in the afternoon sharp ride into town
and up to the Ranchers Bank Val Verdes a pretty big town Never been
any holdups there Town feels safe Make it a clean fast daylight job
Thats all Have you got the details

Knell did not even ask for the dates again

Suppose Poggin or me might be detained he asked

Longstreth bent a dark glance upon his lieutenant

You never can tell whatll come off continued Knell Ill do my
best

The minute you see Poggin tell him A job on hand steadies him And I
say againlook to it that nothing happens Either you or Poggin carry
the job through But I want both of you in it Break for the hills and
when you get up in the rocks where you can hide your tracks head for
Mount Ord When alls quiet again Ill join you here Thats all Call
in the boys

Like a swift shadow and as noiseless Duane stole across the level toward
the dark wall of rock Every nerve was a strung wire For a little while
his mind was cluttered and clogged with whirling thoughts from which
like a flashing scroll unrolled the long baffling order of action The
game was now in his hands He must cross Mount Ord at night The feat
was improbable but it might be done He must ride into Bradford forty
miles from the foothills before eight oclock next morning He must
telegraph MacNelly to be in Val Verde on the twentyfifth He must ride
back to Ord to intercept Knell face him be denounced kill him and
while the iron was hot strike hard to win Poggins halfwon interest as
he had wholly won Fletchers Failing that last he must let the outlaws
alone to bide their time in Ord to be free to ride on to their new job
in Val Verde In the mean time he must plan to arrest Longstreth It
was a magnificent outline incredible alluring unfathomable in
its nameless certainty He felt like fate He seemed to be the iron
consequences falling upon these doomed outlaws

Under the wall the shadows were black only the tips of trees and crags
showing yet he went straight to the trail It was merely a grayness
between borders of black He climbed and never stopped It did not
seem steep His feet might have had eyes He surmounted the wall and
looking down into the ebony gulf pierced by one point of light he
lifted a menacing arm and shook it Then he strode on and did not falter
till he reached the huge shelving cliffs Here he lost the trail there
was none but he remembered the shapes the points the notches of rock
above Before he reached the ruins of splintered ramparts and jumbles of
broken walls the moon topped the eastern slope of the mountain and the
mystifying blackness he had dreaded changed to magic silver light
It seemed as light as day only soft mellow and the air held a
transparent sheen He ran up the bare ridges and down the smooth slopes
and like a goat jumped from rock to rock In this light he knew his
way and lost no time looking for a trail He crossed the divide and then
had all downhill before him Swiftly he descended almost always sure of
his memory of the landmarks He did not remember having studied them in
the ascent yet here they were even in changed light familiar to his
sight What he had once seen was pictured on his mind And true as
a deer striking for home he reached the canon where he had left his
horse

Bullet was quickly and easily found Duane threw on the saddle and pack
cinched them tight and resumed his descent The worst was now to come
Bare downward steps in rock sliding weathered slopes narrow black
gullies a thousand openings in a maze of broken stonethese Duane had
to descend in fast time leading a giant of a horse Bullet cracked the
loose fragments sent them rolling slid on the scaly slopes plunged
down the steps followed like a faithful dog at Duanes heels

Hours passed as moments Duane was equal to his great opportunity But
he could not quell that self in him which reached back over the lapse
of lonely searing years and found the boy in him He who had been worse
than dead was now grasping at the skirts of lifewhich meant victory
honor happiness Duane knew he was not just right in part of his mind
Small wonder that he was not insane he thought He tramped on downward
his marvelous faculty for covering rough ground and holding to the true
course never before even in flight so keen and acute Yet all the time
a spirit was keeping step with him Thought of Ray Longstreth as he had
left her made him weak But now with the game clear to its end with
the trap to spring with success strangely haunting him Duane could not
dispel memory of her He saw her white face with its sweet sad lips and
the dark eyes so tender and tragic And time and distance and risk and
toil were nothing

The moon sloped to the west Shadows of trees and crags now crossed to
the other side of him The stars dimmed Then he was out of the rocks
with the dim trail pale at his feet Mounting Bullet he made short work
of the long slope and the foothills and the rolling land leading down
to Ord The little outlaw camp with its shacks and cabins and row of
houses lay silent and dark under the paling moon Duane passed by on
the lower trail headed into the road and put Bullet to a gallop He
watched the dying moon the waning stars and the east He had time
to spare so he saved the horse Knell would be leaving the rendezvous
about the time Duane turned back toward Ord Between noon and sunset
they would meet

The night wore on The moon sank behind low mountains in the west
The stars brightened for a while then faded Gray gloom enveloped the
world thickened lay like smoke over the road Then shade by shade it
lightened until through the transparent obscurity shone a dim light

Duane reached Bradford before dawn He dismounted some distance from the
tracks tied his horse and then crossed over to the station He heard
the clicking of the telegraph instrument and it thrilled him An
operator sat inside reading When Duane tapped on the window he looked
up with startled glance then went swiftly to unlock the door

Hello Give me paper and pencil Quick whispered Duane

With trembling hands the operator complied Duane wrote out the message
he had carefully composed

Send thisrepeat it to make surethen keep mum Ill see you again
Goodby

The operator stared but did not speak a word

Duane left as stealthily and swiftly as he had come He walked his horse
a couple miles back on the road and then rested him till break of day
The east began to redden Duane turned grimly in the direction of Ord

When Duane swung into the wide grassy square on the outskirts of Ord
he saw a bunch of saddled horses hitched in front of the tavern He knew
what that meant Luck still favored him If it would only hold But he
could ask no more The rest was a matter of how greatly he could make
his power felt An open conflict against odds lay in the balance That
would be fatal to him and to avoid it he had to trust to his name and a
presence he must make terrible He knew outlaws He knew what qualities
held them He knew what to exaggerate

There was not an outlaw in sight The dusty horses had covered distance
that morning As Duane dismounted he heard loud angry voices inside the
tavern He removed coat and vest hung them over the pommel He packed
two guns one belted high on the left hip the other swinging low on the
right side He neither looked nor listened but boldly pushed the door
and stepped inside

The big room was full of men and every face pivoted toward him Knells
pale face flashed into Duanes swift sight then Boldts then Blossom
Kanes then Panhandle Smiths then Fletchers then others that were
familiar and last that of Poggin Though Duane had never seen Poggin or
heard him described he knew him For he saw a face that was a record of
great and evil deeds

There was absolute silence The outlaws were lined back of a long table
upon which were papers stacks of silver coin a bundle of bills and a
huge goldmounted gun

Are you gents lookin for me asked Duane He gave his voice all the
ringing force and power of which he was capable And he stepped back
free of anything with the outlaws all before him

Knell stood quivering but his face might have been a mask The other
outlaws looked from him to Duane Jim Fletcher flung up his hands

My Gawd Dodge whatd you bust in here fer he said plaintively and
slowly stepped forward His action was that of a man true to himself He
meant he had been sponsor for Duane and now he would stand by him

Back Fletcher called Duane and his voice made the outlaw jump

Hold on Dodge an youall everybody said Fletcher Let me talk
seein Im in wrong here

His persuasions did not ease the strain

Go ahead Talk said Poggin

Fletcher turned to Duane Pard Im takin it on myself thet you meet
enemies here when I swore youd meet friends Its my fault Ill stand
by you if you let me

No Jim replied Duane

But whatd you come fer without the signal burst out Fletcher in
distress He saw nothing but catastrophe in this meeting

Jim I aint pressin my company none But when Im wanted bad

Fletcher stopped him with a raised hand Then he turned to Poggin with a
rude dignity

Poggy hes my pard an hes riled I never told him a word thetd
make him sore I only said Knell hadnt no more use fer him than fer
me Now what you say goes in this gang I never failed you in my life
Heres my pard I vouch fer him Will you stand fer me Theres goin to
be hell if you dont An us with a big job on hand

While Fletcher toiled over his slow earnest persuasion Duane had his
gaze riveted upon Poggin There was something leonine about Poggin He
was tawny He blazed He seemed beautiful as fire was beautiful But
looked at closer with glance seeing the physical man instead of that
thing which shone from him he was of perfect build with muscles that
swelled and rippled bulging his clothes with the magnificent head and
face of the cruel fierce tawnyeyed jaguar

Looking at this strange Poggin instinctively divining his abnormal
and hideous power Duane had for the first time in his life the inward
quaking fear of a man It was like a coldtongued bell ringing within
him and numbing his heart The old instinctive firing of blood followed
but did not drive away that fear He knew He felt something here deeper
than thought could go And he hated Poggin

That individual had been considering Fletchers appeal

Jim I ante up he said an if Phil doesnt raise us out with a big
handwhy hell get called an your pard can set in the game

Every eye shifted to Knell He was dead white He laughed and any one
hearing that laugh would have realized his intense anger equally with an
assurance which made him master of the situation

Poggin youre a gambler you arethe acehigh straightflush hand of
the Big Bend he said with stinging scorn Ill bet you my roll to a
greaser peso that I can deal you a hand youll be afraid to play

Phil youre talkin wild growled Poggin with both advice and menace
in his tone

If theres anythin you hate its a man who pretends to be somebody
else when hes not Thet so

Poggin nodded in slowgathering wrath

Well Jims new pardthis man Dodgehes not who he seems Ohho
Hes a hell of a lot different But _I_ know him An when I spring
his name on you Poggin youll freeze to your gizzard Do you get
me Youll freeze an your handll be stiff when it ought to be
lightninAll because youll realize youve been standin there five
minutesfive minutes ALIVE before him

If not hate then assuredly great passion toward Poggin manifested
itself in Knells scornful fiery address in the shaking hand he thrust
before Poggins face In the ensuing silent pause Knells panting could
be plainly heard The other men were pale watchful cautiously edging
either way to the wall leaving the principals and Duane in the center
of the room

Spring his name then you said Poggin violently with a curse

Strangely Knell did not even look at the man he was about to denounce
He leaned toward Poggin his hands his body his long head all somewhat
expressive of what his face disguised

BUCK DUANE he yelled suddenly

The name did not make any great difference in Poggin But Knells
passionate swift utterance carried the suggestion that the name ought
to bring Poggin to quick action It was possible too that Knells
manner the import of his denunciation the meaning back of all his
passion held Poggin bound more than the surprise For the outlaw
certainly was surprised perhaps staggered at the idea that he Poggin
had been about to stand sponsor with Fletcher for a famous outlaw hated
and feared by all outlaws

Knell waited a long moment and then his face broke its cold immobility
in an extraordinary expression of devilish glee He had hounded the
great Poggin into something that gave him vicious monstrous joy

BUCK DUANE Yes he broke out hotly The Nueces gunman That
twoshot aceofspades lone wolf You an Iweve heard a thousand
times of himtalked about him often An here he IN FRONT of you
Poggin you were backin Fletchers new pard Buck Duane An hed
fooled you both but for me But _I_ know him An I know why he drifted
in here To flash a gun on Cheseldineon youon me Bah Dont tell me
he wanted to join the gang You know a gunman for youre one yourself
Dont you always want to kill another man An dont you always want to
meet a real man not a fourflush Its the madness of the gunman an I
know it Well Duane faced youcalled you An when I sprung his name
what ought you have done What would the bossanybodyhave expected of
Poggin Did you throw your gun swift like you have so often Naw you
froze An why Because heres a man with the kind of nerve youd love
to have Because hes greatmeetin us here alone Because you know
hes a wonder with a gun an you love life Because you an I an every
damned man here had to take his front each to himself If we all drew
wed kill him Sure But whos goin to lead Who was goin to be first
Who was goin to make him draw Not you Poggin You leave that for a
lesser manmewhove lived to see you a coward It comes once to every
gunman Youve met your match in Buck Duane An by God Im glad
Heres once I show you up

The hoarse taunting voice failed Knell stepped back from the comrade
he hated He was wet shaking haggard but magnificent

Buck Duane do you remember Hardin he asked in scarcely audible
voice

Yes replied Duane and a flash of insight made clear Knells
attitude

You met himforced him to drawkilled him

Yes

Hardin was the best pard I ever had

His teeth clicked together tight and his lips set in a thin line

The room grew still Even breathing ceased The time for words
had passed In that long moment of suspense Knells body gradually
stiffened and at last the quivering ceased He crouched His eyes had a
soulpiercing fire

Duane watched them He waited He caught the thoughtthe breaking of
Knells musclebound rigidity Then he drew

Through the smoke of his gun he saw two red spurts of flame Knells
bullets thudded into the ceiling He fell with a scream like a wild
thing in agony

Duane did not see Knell die He watched Poggin And Poggin like a
stricken and astounded man looked down upon his prostrate comrade

Fletcher ran at Duane with hands aloft

Hit the trail you liar or youll hev to kill me he yelled

With hands still up he shouldered and bodied Duane out of the room

Duane leaped on his horse spurred and plunged away



CHAPTER XXIII

Duane returned to Fairdale and camped in the mesquite till the
twentythird of the month The few days seemed endless All he could
think of was that the hour in which he must disgrace Ray Longstreth was
slowly but inexorably coming In that waiting time he learned what
love was and also duty When the day at last dawned he rode like one
possessed down the rough slope hurdling the stones and crashing through
the brush with a sound in his ears that was not all the rush of the
wind Something dragged at him

Apparently one side of his mind was unalterably fixed while the other
was a hurrying conglomeration of flashes of thought reception of
sensations He could not get calmness By and by almost involuntarily
he hurried faster on Action seemed to make his state less oppressive
it eased the weight But the farther he went on the harder it was to
continue Had he turned his back upon love happiness perhaps on life
itself

There seemed no use to go on farther until he was absolutely sure of
himself Duane received a clear warning thought that such work as seemed
haunting and driving him could never be carried out in the mood under
which he labored He hung on to that thought Several times he slowed
up then stopped only to go on again At length as he mounted a low
ridge Fairdale lay bright and green before him not far away and the
sight was a conclusive check There were mesquites on the ridge and
Duane sought the shade beneath them It was the noonhour with hot
glary sun and no wind Here Duane had to have out his fight Duane was
utterly unlike himself he could not bring the old self back he was
not the same man he once had been But he could understand why It was
because of Ray Longstreth Temptation assailed him To have her his
wife It was impossible The thought was insidiously alluring Duane
pictured a home He saw himself riding through the cotton and rice and
cane home to a stately old mansion where longeared hounds bayed him
welcome and a woman looked for him and met him with happy and beautiful
smile There mightthere would be children And something new strange
confounding with its emotion came to life deep in Duanes heart There
would be children Ray their mother The kind of life a lonely outcast
always yearned for and never had He saw it all felt it all

But beyond and above all other claims came Captain MacNellys It was
then there was something cold and deathlike in Duanes soul For he
knew whatever happened of one thing he was surehe would have to kill
either Longstreth or Lawson Longstreth might be trapped into arrest
but Lawson had no sense no control no fear He would snarl like a
panther and go for his gun and he would have to be killed This of all
consummations was the one to be calculated upon

Duane came out of it all bitter and callous and sorein the most
fitting of moods to undertake a difficult and deadly enterprise He had
fallen upon his old strange futile dreams now rendered poignant by
reason of love He drove away those dreams In their places came the
images of the oliveskinned Longstreth with his sharp eyes and the
dark evilfaced Lawson and then returned tenfold more thrilling and
sinister the old strange passion to meet Poggin

It was about one oclock when Duane rode into Fairdale The streets for
the most part were deserted He went directly to find Morton and Zimmer
He found them at length restless somber anxious but unaware of the
part he had played at Ord They said Longstreth was home too It was
possible that Longstreth had arrived home in ignorance

Duane told them to be on hand in town with their men in case he might
need them and then with teeth locked he set off for Longstreths ranch

Duane stole through the bushes and trees and when nearing the porch
he heard loud angry familiar voices Longstreth and Lawson were
quarreling again How Duanes lucky star guided him He had no plan of
action but his brain was equal to a hundred lightningswift evolutions
He meant to take any risk rather than kill Longstreth Both of the men
were out on the porch Duane wormed his way to the edge of the shrubbery
and crouched low to watch for his opportunity

Longstreth looked haggard and thin He was in his shirtsleeves and he
had come out with a gun in his hand This he laid on a table near the
wall He wore no belt

Lawson was red bloated thicklipped all fiery and sweaty from drink
though sober on the moment and he had the expression of a desperate
man in his last stand It was his last stand though he was ignorant of
that

Whats your news You neednt be afraid of my feelings said Lawson

Ray confessed to an interest in this ranger replied Longstreth

Duane thought Lawson would choke He was thicknecked anyway and the
rush of blood made him tear at the soft collar of his shirt Duane
awaited his chance patient cold all his feelings shut in a vise

But why should your daughter meet this ranger demanded Lawson
harshly

Shes in love with him and hes in love with her

Duane reveled in Lawsons condition The statement might have had the
force of a juggernaut Was Longstreth sincere What was his game

Lawson finding his voice cursed Ray cursed the ranger then
Longstreth

You damned selfish fool cried Longstreth in deep bitter scorn All
you think of is yourselfyour loss of the girl Think once of MEmy
homemy life

Then the connection subtly put out by Longstreth apparently dawned upon
the other Somehow through this girl her father and cousin were to be
betrayed Duane got that impression though he could not tell how true
it was Certainly Lawsons jealousy was his paramount emotion

To hell with you burst out Lawson incoherently He was frenzied
Ill have her or nobody else will

You never will returned Longstreth stridently So help me God Id
rather see her the rangers wife than yours

While Lawson absorbed that shock Longstreth leaned toward him all of
hate and menace in his mien

Lawson you made me what I am continued Longstreth I backed
youshielded you YOURE Cheseldineif the truth is told Now its
ended I quit you Im done

Their gray passioncorded faces were still as stones

GENTLEMEN Duane called in farreaching voice as he stepped out
YOURE BOTH DONE

They wheeled to confront Duane

Dont move Not a muscle Not a finger he warned

Longstreth read what Lawson had not the mind to read His face turned
from gray to ashen

What dye mean yelled Lawson fiercely shrilly It was not in him to
obey a command to see impending death

All quivering and strung yet with perfect control Duane raised his
left hand to turn back a lapel of his open vest The silver star flashed
brightly

Lawson howled like a dog With barbarous and insane fury with sheer
impotent folly he swept a clawing hand for his gun Duanes shot broke
his action

Before Lawson ever tottered before he loosed the gun Longstreth leaped
behind him clasped him with left arm quick as lightning jerked the
gun from both clutching fingers and sheath Longstreth protected himself
with the body of the dead man Duane saw red flashes puffs of smoke
he heard quick reports Something stung his left arm Then a blow like
wind light of sound yet shocking in impact struck him staggered him
The hot rend of lead followed the blow Duanes heart seemed to explode
yet his mind kept extraordinarily clear and rapid

Duane heard Longstreth work the action of Lawsons gun He heard the
hammer click fall upon empty shells Longstreth had used up all the
loads in Lawsons gun He cursed as a man cursed at defeat Duane
waited cool and sure now Longstreth tried to lift the dead man to
edge him closer toward the table where his own gun lay But considering
the peril of exposing himself he found the task beyond him He bent
peering at Duane under Lawsons arm which flopped out from his side
Longstreths eyes were the eyes of a man who meant to kill There was
never any mistaking the strange and terrible light of eyes like
those More than once Duane had a chance to aim at them at the top of
Longstreths head at a strip of his side

Longstreth flung Lawsons body off But even as it dropped before
Longstreth could leap as he surely intended for the gun Duane covered
him called piercingly to him

Dont jump for the gun Dont Ill kill you Sure as God Ill kill
you

Longstreth stood perhaps ten feet from the table where his gun lay Duane
saw him calculating chances He was game He had the courage that forced
Duane to respect him Duane just saw him measure the distance to that
gun He was magnificent He meant to do it Duane would have to kill
him

Longstreth listen cried Duane swiftly The games up Youre done
But think of your daughter Ill spare your lifeIll try to get you
freedom on one condition For her sake Ive got you nailedall the
proofs There lies Lawson Youre alone Ive Morton and men to my aid
Give up Surrender Consent to demands and Ill spare you Maybe I can
persuade MacNelly to let you go free back to your old country Its for
Rays sake Her life perhaps her happiness can be saved Hurry man
Your answer

Suppose I refuse he queried with a dark and terrible earnestness

Then Ill kill you in your tracks You cant move a hand Your word or
death Hurry Longstreth Be a man For her sake Quick Another second
nowIll kill you

All right Buck Duane I give my word he said and deliberately
walked to the chair and fell into it

Longstreth looked strangely at the bloody blot on Duanes shoulder

There come the girls he suddenly exclaimed Can you help me drag
Lawson inside They mustnt see him

Duane was facing down the porch toward the court and corrals Miss
Longstreth and Ruth had come in sight were swiftly approaching
evidently alarmed The two men succeeded in drawing Lawson into the
house before the girls saw him

Duane youre not hard hit said Longstreth

Reckon not replied Duane

Im sorry If only you could have told me sooner Lawson damn him
Always Ive split over him

But the last time Longstreth

Yes and I came near driving you to kill me too Duane you talked
me out of it For Rays sake Shell be in here in a minute Thisll be
harder than facing a gun

Hard now But I hope itll turn out all right

Duane will you do me a favor he asked and he seemed shamefaced

Sure

Let Ray and Ruth think Lawson shot you Hes dead It cant matter
Duane the old side of my life is coming back Its been coming Itll
be here just about when she enters this room And by God Id change
places with Lawson if I could

Glad yousaid that Longstreth replied Duane And sureLawson
plugged me Its our secret

Just then Ray and Ruth entered the room Duane heard two low cries so
different in tone and he saw two white faces Ray came to his side She
lifted a shaking hand to point at the blood upon his breast White and
mute she gazed from that to her father

Papa cried Ray wringing her hands

Dont give way he replied huskily Both you girls will need your
nerve Duane isnt badly hurt But Floyd isis dead Listen Let me
tell it quick Theres been a fight Itit was Lawsonit was Lawsons
gun that shot Duane Duane let me off In fact Ray he saved me Im
to divide my propertyreturn so far as possible what Ive stolenleave
Texas at once with Duane under arrest He says maybe he can get
MacNelly the ranger captain to let me go For your sake

She stood there realizing her deliverance with the dark and tragic
glory of her eyes passing from her father to Duane

You must rise above this said Duane to her I expected this to ruin
you But your father is alive He will live it down Im sure I can
promise you hell be free Perhaps back there in Louisiana the dishonor
will never be known This country is far from your old home And even in
San Antonio and Austin a mans evil repute means little Then the line
between a rustler and a rancher is hard to draw in these wild border
days Rustling is stealing cattle and I once heard a wellknown rancher
say that all rich cattlemen had done a little stealing Your father
drifted out here and like a good many others he succeeded Its
perhaps just as well not to split hairs to judge him by the law and
morality of a civilized country Some way or other he drifted in with
bad men Maybe a deal that was honest somehow tied his hands This
matter of land water a few stray head of stock had to be decided out
of court Im sure in his case he never realized where he was drifting
Then one thing led to another until he was face to face with dealing
that took on crooked form To protect himself he bound men to him And
so the gang developed Many powerful gangs have developed that way
out here He could not control them He became involved with them And
eventually their dealings became deliberately and boldly dishonest That
meant the inevitable spilling of blood sooner or later and so he grew
into the leader because he was the strongest Whatever he is to be
judged for I think he could have been infinitely worse



CHAPTER XXIV

On the morning of the twentysixth Duane rode into Bradford in time to
catch the early train His wounds did not seriously incapacitate him
Longstreth was with him And Miss Longstreth and Ruth Herbert would not
be left behind They were all leaving Fairdale for ever Longstreth had
turned over the whole of his property to Morton who was to divide it
as he and his comrades believed just Duane had left Fairdale with his
party by night passed through Sanderson in the early hours of dawn and
reached Bradford as he had planned

That fateful morning found Duane outwardly calm but inwardly he was
in a tumult He wanted to rush to Val Verde Would Captain MacNelly be
there with his rangers as Duane had planned for them to be Memory of
that tawny Poggin returned with strange passion Duane had borne hours
and weeks and months of waiting had endured the long hours of the
outlaw but now he had no patience The whistle of the train made him
leap

It was a fast train yet the ride seemed slow

Duane disliking to face Longstreth and the passengers in the car
changed his seat to one behind his prisoner They had seldom spoken
Longstreth sat with bowed head deep in thought The girls sat in a
seat near by and were pale but composed Occasionally the train halted
briefly at a station The latter half of that ride Duane had observed
a wagonroad running parallel with the railroad sometimes right
alongside at others near or far away When the train was about twenty
miles from Val Verde Duane espied a dark group of horsemen trotting
eastward His blood beat like a hammer at his temples The gang
He thought he recognized the tawny Poggin and felt a strange inward
contraction He thought he recognized the cleancut Blossom Kane the
blackbearded giant Boldt the redfaced Panhandle Smith and Fletcher
There was another man strange to him Was that Knell No it could not
have been Knell

Duane leaned over the seat and touched Longstreth on the shoulder

Look he whispered Cheseldine was stiff He had already seen

The train flashed by the outlaw gang receded out of range of sight

Did you notice Knell wasnt with them whispered Duane

Duane did not speak to Longstreth again till the train stopped at Val
Verde

They got off the car and the girls followed as naturally as ordinary
travelers The station was a good deal larger than that at Bradford and
there was considerable action and bustle incident to the arrival of the
train

Duanes sweeping gaze searched faces rested upon a man who seemed
familiar This fellows look too was that of one who knew Duane but
was waiting for a sign a cue Then Duane recognized himMacNelly
cleanshaven Without mustache he appeared different younger

When MacNelly saw that Duane intended to greet him to meet him he
hurried forward A keen light flashed from his eyes He was glad eager
yet suppressing himself and the glances he sent back and forth from
Duane to Longstreth were questioning doubtful Certainly Longstreth did
not look the part of an outlaw

Duane Lord Im glad to see you was the Captains greeting Then at
closer look into Duanes face his warmth fledsomething he saw there
checked his enthusiasm or at least its utterance

MacNelly shake hand with Cheseldine said Duane lowvoiced

The ranger captain stood dumb motionless But he saw Longstreths
instant action and awkwardly he reached for the outstretched hand

Any of your men down here queried Duane sharply

No Theyre uptown

Come MacNelly you walk with him Weve ladies in the party Ill come
behind with them

They set off uptown Longstreth walked as if he were with friends on
the way to dinner The girls were mute MacNelly walked like a man in a
trance There was not a word spoken in four blocks

Presently Duane espied a stone building on a corner of the broad street
There was a big sign Ranchers Bank

Theres the hotel said MacNelly Some of my men are there Weve
scattered around

They crossed the street went through office and lobby and then Duane
asked MacNelly to take them to a private room Without a word the
Captain complied When they were all inside Duane closed the door and
drawing a deep breath as if of relief he faced them calmly

Miss Longstreth you and Miss Ruth try to make yourselves comfortable
now he said And dont be distressed Then he turned to his captain
MacNelly this girl is the daughter of the man Ive brought to you and
this one is his niece

Then Duane briefly related Longstreths story and though he did not
spare the rustler chief he was generous

When I went after Longstreth concluded Duane it was either to kill
him or offer him freedom on conditions So I chose the latter for his
daughters sake He has already disposed of all his property I believe
hell live up to the conditions Hes to leave Texas never to return
The name Cheseldine has been a mystery and now itll fade

A few moments later Duane followed MacNelly to a large room like a
hall and here were men reading and smoking Duane knew themrangers

MacNelly beckoned to his men

Boys here he is

How many men have you asked Duane

Fifteen

MacNelly almost embraced Duane would probably have done so but for the
dark grimness that seemed to be coming over the man Instead he glowed
he sputtered he tried to talk to wave his hands He was beside
himself And his rangers crowded closer eager like hounds ready to
run They all talked at once and the word most significant and frequent
in their speech was outlaws

MacNelly clapped his fist in his hand

Thisll make the adjutant sick with joy Maybe we wont have it on the
Governor Well show them about the ranger service Duane howd you
ever do it

Now Captain not the half nor the quarter of this jobs done The
gangs coming down the road I saw them from the train Theyll ride
into town on the dottwothirty

How many asked MacNelly

Poggin Blossom Kane Panhandle Smith Boldt Jim Fletcher and another
man I dont know These are the picked men of Cheseldines gang Ill
bet theyll be the fastest hardest bunch you rangers ever faced

Pogginthats the hard nut to crack Ive heard their records since
Ive been in Val Verde Wheres Knell They say hes a boy but hell and
blazes

Knells dead

Ah exclaimed MacNelly softly Then he grew businesslike cool and
of harder aspect Duane its your game today Im only a ranger under
orders Were all under your orders Weve absolute faith in you Make
your plan quick so I can go around and post the boys whore not here

You understand theres no sense in trying to arrest Poggin Kane and
that lot queried Duane

No I dont understand that replied MacNelly bluntly

It cant be done The drop cant be got on such men If you meet them
they shoot and mighty quick and straight Poggin That outlaw has no
equal with a gununlessHes got to be killed quick Theyll all have
to be killed Theyre all bad desperate know no fear are lightning in
action

Very well Duane then its a fight Thatll be easier perhaps The
boys are spoiling for a fight Out with your plan now

Put one man at each end of this street just at the edge of town Let
him hide there with a rifle to block the escape of any outlaw that we
might fail to get I had a good look at the bank building Its
well situated for our purpose Put four men up in that room over the
bankfour men two at each open window Let them hide till the game
begins They want to be there so in case these foxy outlaws get wise
before theyre down on the ground or inside the bank The rest of your
men put inside behind the counters where theyll hide Now go over to
the bank spring the thing on the bank officials and dont let them
shut up the bank You want their aid Let them make sure of their gold
But the clerks and cashier ought to be at their desks or window when
Poggin rides up Hell glance in before he gets down They make no
mistakes these fellows We must be slicker than they are or lose When
you get the bank people wise send your men over one by one No hurry
no excitement no unusual thing to attract notice in the bank

All right Thats great Tell me where do you intend to wait

Duane heard MacNellys question and it struck him peculiarly He had
seemed to be planning and speaking mechanically As he was confronted
by the fact it nonplussed him somewhat and he became thoughtful with
lowered head

Wherell you wait Duane insisted MacNelly with keen eyes
speculating

Ill wait in front just inside the door replied Duane with an
effort

Why demanded the Captain

Well began Duane slowly Poggin will get down first and start in
But the others wont be far behind Theyll not get swift till inside
The thing isthey MUSTNT get clear inside because the instant they
do theyll pull guns That means death to somebody If we can we want to
stop them just at the door

But will you hide asked MacNelly

Hide The idea had not occurred to Duane

Theres a wideopen doorway a sort of round hall a vestibule with
steps leading up to the bank Theres a door in the vestibule too It
leads somewhere We can put men in there You can be there

Duane was silent

See here Duane began MacNelly nervously You shant take any undue
risk here Youll hide with the rest of us

No The word was wrenched from Duane

MacNelly stared and then a strange comprehending light seemed to flit
over his face

Duane I can give you no orders today he said distinctly Im only
offering advice Need you take any more risks Youve done a grand
job for the servicealready Youve paid me a thousand times for
that pardon Youve redeemed yourselfThe Governor the
adjutantgeneralthe whole state will rise up and honor you The games
almost up Well kill these outlaws or enough of them to break for
ever their power I say as a ranger need you take more risk than your
captain

Still Duane remained silent He was locked between two forces And one
a tide that was bursting at its bounds seemed about to overwhelm him
Finally that side of him the retreating self the weaker found a
voice

Captain you want this job to be sure he asked

Certainly

Ive told you the way I alone know the kind of men to be met Just
WHAT Ill do or WHERE Ill be I cant say yet In meetings like this the
moment decides But Ill be there

MacNelly spread wide his hands looked helplessly at his curious and
sympathetic rangers and shook his head

Now youve done your worklaid the trapis this strange move of yours
going to be fair to Miss Longstreth asked MacNelly in significant low
voice

Like a great tree chopped at the roots Duane vibrated to that He looked
up as if he had seen a ghost

Mercilessly the ranger captain went on You can win her Duane Oh you
cant fool me I was wise in a minute Fight with us from coverthen go
back to her You will have served the Texas Rangers as no other man has
Ill accept your resignation Youll be free honored happy That girl
loves you I saw it in her eyes Shes

But Duane cut him short with a fierce gesture He lunged up to his feet
and the rangers fell back Dark silent grim as he had been still
there was a transformation singularly more sinister stranger

Enough Im done he said somberly Ive planned Do we agreeor
shall I meet Poggin and his gang alone

MacNelly cursed and again threw up his hands this time in baffled
chagrin There was deep regret in his dark eyes as they rested upon
Duane

Duane was left alone

Never had his mind been so quick so clear so wonderful in its
understanding of what had heretofore been intricate and elusive impulses
of his strange nature His determination was to meet Poggin meet him
before any one else had a chancePoggin firstand then the others
He was as unalterable in that decision as if on the instant of its
acceptance he had become stone

Why Then came realization He was not a ranger now He cared nothing
for the state He had no thought of freeing the community of a dangerous
outlaw of ridding the country of an obstacle to its progress and
prosperity He wanted to kill Poggin It was significant now that
he forgot the other outlaws He was the gunman the gunthrower the
gunfighter passionate and terrible His fathers blood that dark and
fierce strain his mothers spirit that strong and unquenchable spirit
of the surviving pioneerthese had been in him and the killings one
after another the wild and haunted years had made him absolutely in
spite of his will the gunman He realized it now bitterly hopelessly
The thing he had intelligence enough to hate he had become At last he
shuddered under the driving ruthless inhuman bloodlust of the gunman
Long ago he had seemed to seal in a tomb that horror of his kindthe
need in order to forget the haunting sleepless presence of his last
victim to go out and kill another But it was still there in his mind
and now it stalked out worse more powerful magnified by its rest
augmented by the violent passions peculiar and inevitable to that
strange wild product of the Texas frontierthe gunfighter And those
passions were so violent so raw so base so much lower than what ought
to have existed in a thinking man Actual pride of his record Actual
vanity in his speed with a gun Actual jealousy of any rival

Duane could not believe it But there he was without a choice What
he had feared for years had become a monstrous reality Respect for
himself blindness a certain honor that he had clung to while in
outlawryall like scales seemed to fall away from him He stood
stripped bare his soul nakedthe soul of Cain Always since the first
brand had been forced and burned upon him he had been ruined But now
with conscience flayed to the quick yet utterly powerless over this
tiger instinct he was lost He said it He admitted it And at the
utter abasement the soul he despised suddenly leaped and quivered with
the thought of Ray Longstreth

Then came agony As he could not govern all the chances of this fatal
meetingas all his swift and deadly genius must be occupied with
Poggin perhaps in vainas hardshooting men whom he could not watch
would be close behind this almost certainly must be the end of Buck
Duane That did not matter But he loved the girl He wanted her All
her sweetness her fire and pleading returned to torture him

At that moment the door opened and Ray Longstreth entered

Duane she said softly Captain MacNelly sent me to you

But you shouldnt have come replied Duane

As soon as he told me I would have come whether he wished it or not
You left meall of usstunned I had no time to thank you Oh I
dowith all my soul It was noble of you Father is overcome He didnt
expect so much And hell be true But Duane I was told to hurry and
here Im selfishly using time

Go thenand leave me You mustnt unnerve me now when theres a
desperate game to finish

Need it be desperate she whispered coming close to him

Yes it cant be else

MacNelly had sent her to weaken him of that Duane was sure And he felt
that she had wanted to come Her eyes were dark strained beautiful
and they shed a light upon Duane he had never seen before

Youre going to take some mad risk she said Let me persuade you not
to You saidyou cared for meand Ioh Duanedont youknow

The low voice deep sweet as an old chord faltered and broke and
failed

Duane sustained a sudden shock and an instant of paralyzed confusion of
thought

She moved she swept out her hands and the wonder of her eyes dimmed in
a flood of tears

My God You cant care for me he cried hoarsely

Then she met him hands outstretched

But I doI do

Swift as light Duane caught her and held her to his breast He stood
holding her tight with the feel of her warm throbbing breast and the
clasp of her arms as flesh and blood realities to fight a terrible fear
He felt her and for the moment the might of it was stronger than all
the demons that possessed him And he held her as if she had been his
soul his strength on earth his hope of Heaven against his lips

The strife of doubt all passed He found his sight again And there
rushed over him a tide of emotion unutterably sweet and full strong
like an intoxicating wine deep as his nature something glorious and
terrible as the blaze of the sun to one long in darkness He had become
an outcast a wanderer a gunman a victim of circumstances he had lost
and suffered worse than death in that loss he had gone down the
endless bloody trail a killer of men a fugitive whose mind slowly
and inevitably closed to all except the instinct to survive and a black
despair and now with this woman in his arms her swelling breast
against his in this moment almost of resurrection he bent under the
storm of passion and joy possible only to him who had endured so much

Do you carea little he whispered unsteadily

He bent over her looking deep into the dark wet eyes

She uttered a low laugh that was half sob and her arms slipped up to
his neck

A littler Oh DuaneDuanea great deal

Their lips met in their first kiss The sweetness the fire of her mouth
seemed so new so strange so irresistible to Duane His sore and hungry
heart throbbed with thick and heavy beats He felt the outcasts need
of love And he gave up to the enthralling moment She met him halfway
returned kiss for kiss clasp for clasp her face scarlet her eyes
closed till her passion and strength spent she fell back upon his
shoulder

Duane suddenly thought she was going to faint He divined then that she
had understood him would have denied him nothing not even her life in
that moment But she was overcome and he suffered a pang of regret at
his unrestraint

Presently she recovered and she drew only the closer and leaned upon
him with her face upturned He felt her hands on his and they were
soft clinging strong like steel under velvet He felt the rise and
fall the warmth of her breast A tremor ran over him He tried to draw
back and if he succeeded a little her form swayed with him pressing
closer She held her face up and he was compelled to look It was
wonderful now white yet glowing with the red lips parted and dark
eyes alluring But that was not all There was passion unquenchable
spirit womans resolve deep and mighty

I love you Duane she said For my sake dont go out to meet this
outlaw face to face Its something wild in you Conquer it if you love
me

Duane became suddenly weak and when he did take her into his arms again
he scarcely had strength to lift her to a seat beside him She seemed
more than a dead weight Her calmness had fled She was throbbing
palpitating quivering with hot wet cheeks and arms that clung to him
like vines She lifted her mouth to his whispering Kiss me She
meant to change him hold him

Duane bent down and her arms went round his neck and drew him close
With his lips on hers he seemed to float away That kiss closed his
eyes and he could not lift his head He sat motionless holding her
blind and helpless wrapped in a sweet dark glory She kissed himone
long endless kissor else a thousand times Her lips her wet cheeks
her hair the softness the fragrance of her the tender clasp of her
arms the swell of her breastall these seemed to inclose him

Duane could not put her from him He yielded to her lips and arms
watching her involuntarily returning her caresses sure now of her
intent fascinated by the sweetness of her bewildered almost lost
This was what it was to be loved by a woman His years of outlawry had
blotted out any boyish love he might have known This was what he had
to give upall this wonder of her sweet person this strange fire he
feared yet loved this mate his deep and tortured soul recognized Never
until that moment had he divined the meaning of a woman to a man That
meaning was physical inasmuch that he learned what beauty was what
marvel in the touch of quickening flesh and it was spiritual in that he
saw there might have been for him under happier circumstances a life
of noble deeds lived for such a woman

Dont go Dont go she cried as he started violently

I must Dear goodby Remember I loved you

He pulled her hands loose from his stepped back

Ray dearestI believeIll come back he whispered

These last words were falsehood

He reached the door gave her one last piercing glance to fix for ever
in memory that white face with its dark staring tragic eyes

DUANE

He fled with that moan like thunder death hell in his ears

To forget her to get back his nerve he forced into mind the image of
PogginPoggin the tawnyhaired the yelloweyed like a jaguar
with his rippling muscles He brought back his sense of the outlaws
wonderful presence his own unaccountable fear and hate Yes Poggin had
sent the cold sickness of fear to his marrow Why since he hated
life so Poggin was his supreme test And this abnormal and stupendous
instinct now deep as the very foundation of his life demanded its wild
and fatal issue There was a horrible thrill in his sudden remembrance
that Poggin likewise had been taunted in fear of him

So the dark tide overwhelmed Duane and when he left the room he was
fierce implacable steeled to any outcome quick like a panther somber
as death in the thrall of his strange passion

There was no excitement in the street He crossed to the bank corner A
clock inside pointed the hour of two He went through the door into the
vestibule looked around passed up the steps into the bank The clerks
were at their desks apparently busy But they showed nervousness The
cashier paled at sight of Duane There were menthe rangerscrouching
down behind the low partition All the windows had been removed from the
iron grating before the desks The safe was closed There was no money
in sight A customer came in spoke to the cashier and was told to come
tomorrow

Duane returned to the door He could see far down the street out into
the country There he waited and minutes were eternities He saw no
person near him he heard no sound He was insulated in his unnatural
strain

At a few minutes before half past two a dark compact body of horsemen
appeared far down turning into the road They came at a sharp trota
group that would have attracted attention anywhere at any time They
came a little faster as they entered town then faster still now they
were four blocks away now three now two Duane backed down the middle
of the vestibule up the steps and halted in the center of the wide
doorway

There seemed to be a rushing in his ears through which pierced sharp
ringing clipclop of iron hoofs He could see only the corner of the
street But suddenly into that shot leanlimbed dusty bay horses There
was a clattering of nervous hoofs pulled to a halt

Duane saw the tawny Poggin speak to his companions He dismounted
quickly They followed suit They had the manner of ranchers about to
conduct some business No guns showed Poggin started leisurely for the
bank door quickening step a little The others close together came
behind him Blossom Kane had a bag in his left hand Jim Fletcher was
left at the curb and he had already gathered up the bridles

Poggin entered the vestibule first with Kane on one side Boldt on the
other a little in his rear

As he strode in he saw Duane

HELLS FIRE he cried

Something inside Duane burst piercing all of him with cold Was it that
fear

BUCK DUANE echoed Kane

One instant Poggin looked up and Duane looked down

Like a striking jaguar Poggin moved Almost as quickly Duane threw his
arm

The guns boomed almost together

Duane felt a blow just before he pulled trigger His thoughts came fast
like the strange dots before his eyes His rising gun had loosened in
his hand Poggin had drawn quicker A tearing agony encompassed his
breast He pulledpulledat random Thunder of booming shots all about
him Red flashes jets of smoke shrill yells He was sinking The end
yes the end With fading sight he saw Kane go down then Boldt But
supreme torture bitterer than death Poggin stood mane like a lions
back to the wall bloodyfaced grand with his guns spouting red

All faded darkened The thunder deadened Duane fell seemed floating
There it driftedRay Longstreths sweet face white with dark tragic
eyes fading from his sight fading  fading



CHAPTER XXV

Light shone before Duanes eyesthick strange light that came and
went For a long time dull and booming sounds rushed by filling all
It was a dream in which there was nothing a drifting under a burden
darkness light sound movement and vague obscure sense of timetime
that was very long There was firecreeping consuming fire A dark
cloud of flame enveloped him rolled him away

He saw then dimly a room that was strange strange people moving about
over him with faint voices far away things in a dream He saw again
clearly and consciousness returned still unreal still strange full
of those vague and faraway things Then he was not dead He lay stiff
like a stone with a weight ponderous as a mountain upon him and all his
bound body racked in slow dullbeating agony

A womans face hovered over him white and tragiceyed like one of his
old haunting phantoms yet sweet and eloquent Then a mans face bent
over him looked deep into his eyes and seemed to whisper from a
distance DuaneDuane Ah he knew me

After that there was another long interval of darkness When the light
came again clearer this time the same earnestfaced man bent over him
It was MacNelly And with recognition the past flooded back

Duane tried to speak His lips were weak and he could scarcely move
them

Poggin he whispered His first real conscious thought was for Poggin
Ruling passioneternal instinct

Poggin is dead Duane shot to pieces replied MacNelly solemnly
What a fight he made He killed two of my men wounded others God he
was a tiger He used up three guns before we downed him

Whogotaway

Fletcher the man with the horses We downed all the others Duane the
jobs doneits done Why man youre

What ofofHER

Miss Longstreth has been almost constantly at your bedside She helped
the doctor She watched your wounds And Duane the other night when
you sank lowso lowI think it was her spirit that held yours back
Oh shes a wonderful girl Duane she never gave up never lost her
nerve for a moment Well were going to take you home and shell go
with us Colonel Longstreth left for Louisiana right after the fight I
advised it There was great excitement It was best for him to leave

Have Iachanceto recover

Chance Why man exclaimed the Captain youll get well Youll pack
a sight of lead all your life But you can stand that Duane the whole
Southwest knows your story You need never again be ashamed of the name
Buck Duane The brand outlaw is washed out Texas believes youve been
a secret ranger all the time Youre a hero And now think of home your
mother of this noble girlof your future

The rangers took Duane home to Wellston

A railroad had been built since Duane had gone into exile Wellston had
grown A noisy crowd surrounded the station but it stilled as Duane was
carried from the train

A sea of faces pressed close Some were faces he
rememberedschoolmates friends old neighbors There was an upflinging
of many hands Duane was being welcomed home to the town from which he
had fled A deadness within him broke This welcome hurt him somehow
quickened him and through his cold being his weary mind passed a
change His sight dimmed

Then there was a white house his old home How strange yet how real
His heart beat fast Had so many many years passed Familiar yet
strange it was and all seemed magnified

They carried him in these ranger comrades and laid him down and
lifted his head upon pillows The house was still though full of
people Duanes gaze sought the open door

Some one entereda tall girl in white with dark wet eyes and a light
upon her face She was leading an old lady grayhaired austerefaced
somber and sad His mother She was feeble but she walked erect She
was pale shaking yet maintained her dignity

The some one in white uttered a low cry and knelt by Duanes bed His
mother flung wide her arms with a strange gesture

This man Theyve not brought back my boy This mans his father Where
is my son My sonoh my son

When Duane grew stronger it was a pleasure to lie by the west window and
watch Uncle Jim whittle his stick and listen to his talk The old man
was broken now He told many interesting things about people Duane had
knownpeople who had grown up and married failed succeeded gone
away and died But it was hard to keep Uncle Jim off the subject of
guns outlaws fights He could not seem to divine how mention of these
things hurt Duane Uncle Jim was childish now and he had a great pride
in his nephew He wanted to hear of all of Duanes exile And if there
was one thing more than another that pleased him it was to talk about
the bullets which Duane carried in his body

Five bullets aint it he asked for the hundredth time

Five in that last scrap By gum And you had six before

Yes uncle replied Duane

Five and six That makes eleven By gum A mans a man to carry all
that lead But Buck you could carry more Theres that nigger Edwards
right here in Wellston Hes got a ton of bullets in him Doesnt seem
to mind them none And theres Cole Miller Ive seen him Been a bad
man in his day They say he packs twentythree bullets But hes bigger
than yougot more flesh Funny wasnt it Buck about the
doctor only bein able to cut one bullet out of youthat one in your
breastbone It was a fortyone caliber an unusual cartridge I saw it
and I wanted it but Miss Longstreth wouldnt part with it Buck there
was a bullet left in one of Poggins guns and that bullet was the same
kind as the one cut out of you By gum Boy itd have killed you if
itd stayed there

It would indeed uncle replied Duane and the old haunting somber
mood returned

But Duane was not often at the mercy of childish old heroworshiping
Uncle Jim Miss Longstreth was the only person who seemed to divine
Duanes gloomy mood and when she was with him she warded off all
suggestion

One afternoon while she was there at the west window a message came
for him They read it together

You have saved the ranger service to the Lone Star State

MACNELLEY

Ray knelt beside him at the window and he believed she meant to speak
then of the thing they had shunned Her face was still white but
sweeter now warm with rich life beneath the marble and her dark eyes
were still intent still haunted by shadows but no longer tragic

Im glad for MacNellys sake as well as the states said Duane

She made no reply to that and seemed to be thinking deeply Duane shrank
a little

The painIs it any worse today she asked instantly

No its the same It will always be the same Im full of lead you
know But I dont mind a little pain

Thenits the old moodthe fear she whispered Tell me

Yes It haunts me Ill be well soonable to go out Then thatthat
hell will come back

No no she said with emotion

Some drunken cowboy some fool with a gun will hunt me out in every
town wherever I go he went on miserably Buck Duane To kill Buck
Duane

Hush Dont speak so Listen You remember that day in Val Verde
when I came to youplead with you not to meet Poggin Oh that was a
terrible hour for me But it showed me the truth I saw the struggle
between your passion to kill and your love for me I could have saved
you then had I known what I know now Now I understand thatthat thing
which haunts you But youll never have to draw again Youll never have
to kill another man thank God

Like a drowning man he would have grasped at straws but he could not
voice his passionate query

She put tender arms round his neck Because youll have me with
you always she replied Because always I shall be between you and
thatthat terrible thing

It seemed with the spoken thought absolute assurance of her power came
to her Duane realized instantly that he was in the arms of a stronger
woman that she who had plead with him that fatal day

Wellwell be married and leave Texas she said softly with the
red blood rising rich and dark in her cheeks

Ray

Yes we will though youre laggard in asking me sir

But dearsuppose he replied huskily suppose there might bebe
childrena boy A boy with his fathers blood

I pray God there will be I do not fear what you fear But even
sohell be half my blood

Duane felt the storm rise and break in him And his terror was that of
joy quelling fear The shining glory of love in this womans eyes made
him weak as a child How could she love himhow could she so bravely
face a future with him Yet she held him in her arms twining her
hands round his neck and pressing close to him Her faith and love and
beautythese she meant to throw between him and all that terrible past
They were her power and she meant to use them all He dared not think
of accepting her sacrifice

But Rayyou dear noble girlIm poor I have nothing And Im a
cripple

Oh youll be well some day she replied And listen I have money
My mother left me well off All she had was her fathersDo you
understand Well take Uncle Jim and your mother Well go to
Louisianato my old home Its far from here Theres a plantation to
work There are horses and cattlea great cypress forest to cut Oh
youll have much to do Youll forget there Youll learn to love my
home Its a beautiful old place There are groves where the gray moss
blows all day and the nightingales sing all night

My darling cried Duane brokenly No no no

Yet he knew in his heart that he was yielding to her that he could not
resist her a moment longer What was this madness of love

Well be happy she whispered Oh I know Comecomecome

Her eyes were closing heavylidded and she lifted sweet tremulous
waiting lips

With bursting heart Duane bent to them Then he held her close pressed
to him while with dim eyes he looked out over the line of low hills
in the west down where the sun was setting gold and red down over the
Nueces and the wild brakes of the Rio Grande which he was never to see
again

It was in this solemn and exalted moment that Duane accepted happiness
and faced a new life trusting this brave and tender woman to be
stronger than the dark and fateful passion that had shadowed his past

It would come backthat wind of flame that madness to forget that
driving relentless instinct for blood It would come back with those
pale drifting haunting faces and the accusing fading eyes but all his
life always between them and him rendering them powerless would be
the faith and love and beauty of this noble woman
