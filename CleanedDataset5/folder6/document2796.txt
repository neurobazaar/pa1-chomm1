MISS SHUMS HUSBAND



CHAPTER I


I was born in the year one of the present or Christian hera and am in
consquints sevenandthirty years old My mamma called me Charles James
Harrington Fitzroy Yellowplush in compliment to several noble families
and to a sellybrated coachmin whom she knew who wore a yellow livry
and drove the Lord Mayor of London

Why she gev me this genlmns name is a diffiklty or rayther the name of
a part of his dress however its stuck to me through life in which I
was as it were a footman by buth

Praps he was my fatherthough on this subjict I cant speak suttinly
for my ma wrapped up my buth in a mistry I may be illygitmit I may
have been changed at nuss but Ive always had genlmnly tastes through
life and have no doubt that I come of a genlmnly origum

The less I say about my parint the better for the dear old creatur was
very good to me and I fear had very little other goodness in her
Why I cant say but I always passed as her nevyou We led a strange
life sometimes ma was dressed in sattn and rooge and sometimes in rags
and dutt sometimes I got kisses and sometimes kix sometimes gin
and sometimes shampang law bless us how she used to swear at me and
cuddle me there we were quarrelling and making up sober and tipsy
starving and guttling by turns just as ma got money or spent it
But let me draw a vail over the seen and speak of her no moreits
sfishant for the public to know that her name was Miss Montmorency
and we lived in the New Cut

My poor mother died one morning Hevn bless her and I was left alone
in this wide wicked wuld without so much money as would buy me a penny
roal for my brexfast But there was some amongst our naybors and let me
tell you theres more kindness among them poor disrepettable creaturs
than in half a dozen lords or barrynets who took pity upon poor Sals
orfin for they bust out laffin when I called her Miss Montmorency and
gev me bred and shelter Im afraid in spite of their kindness that
my MORRILS wouldnt have improved if Id stayed long among em But a
bennyviolent genlmn saw me and put me to school The academy which I
went to was called the Free School of Saint Bartholomews the Lessthe
young genlmn wore green baize coats yellow leather whatsisnames a tin
plate on the left arm and a cap about the size of a muffing I stayed
there sicks years from sicks that is to say till my twelth year
during three years of witch I distinguished myself not a little in the
musicle way for I bloo the bellus of the church horgin and very fine
tunes we played too

Well its not worth recounting my jewvenile follies what trix we
used to play the applewoman and how we put snuff in the old clarks
Prayerbookmy eye but one day a genlmn entered the schoolroomit
was on the very day when I went to subtraxionand asked the master for
a young lad for a servant They pitched upon me glad enough and nex
day found me sleeping in the sculry close under the sink at Mr Bagos
countryhouse at Pentonwille

Bago kep a shop in Smithfield market and drov a taring good trade in
the hoil and Italian way Ive heard him say that he cleared no less
than fifty pounds every year by letting his front room at hanging time
His winders looked right opsit Newgit and many and many dozen chaps has
he seen hanging there Laws was laws in the year ten and they screwed
chaps nex for nex to nothink But my bisniss was at his countryhouse
where I made my first ontray into fashnabl life I was knife errint
and stableboy then and ant ashamed to own it for my merrits have
raised me to what I amtwo livries forty pound a year maltlicker
washin silkstocking and wax candlesnot countin wails which is
somethink pretty considerable at OUR house I can tell you

I didnt stay long here for a suckmstance happened which got me a very
different situation A handsome young genlmn who kep a tilbry and a
ridin horse at livry wanted a tiger I bid at once for the place and
being a neat tidylooking lad he took me Bago gave me a character and
he my first livry proud enough I was of it as you may fancy

My new master had some business in the city for he went in every
morning at ten got out of his tilbry at the Citty Road and had it
waiting for him at six when if it was summer he spanked round into
the Park and drove one of the neatest turnouts there Wery proud I was
in a goldlaced hat a drab coat and a red weskit to sit by his side
when he drove I already began to ogle the gals in the carridges and to
feel that longing for fashionabl life which Ive had ever since When
he was at the oppera or the play down I went to skittles or to White
Condick Gardens and Mr Frederic Altamonts young man was somebody I
warrant to be sure there is very few manservants at Pentonwille the
poppylation being mostly gals of all work and so though only fourteen
I was as much a man down there as if I had been as old as Jerusalem

But the most singular thing was that my master who was such a gay
chap should live in such a hole He had only a groundfloor in John
Streeta parlor and a bedroom I slep over the way and only came in
with his boots and brexfast of a morning

The house he lodged in belonged to Mr and Mrs Shum They were a poor
but proliffic couple who had rented the place for many years and they
and their family were squeezed in it pretty tight I can tell you

Shum said he had been a hofficer and so he had He had been a
subdeputy assistant vicecommissary or some such think and as
I heerd afterwards had been obliged to leave on account of his
NERVOUSNESS He was such a coward the fact is that he was considered
dangerous to the harmy and sent home

He had married a widow Buckmaster who had been a Miss Slamcoe She was
a Bristol gal and her father being a bankrup in the tallowchandlering
way left in course a pretty little sum of money A thousand pound
was settled on her and she was as high and mighty as if it had been a
millium

Buckmaster died leaving nothink nothink except four ugly daughters by
Miss Slamcoe and her forty pound a year was rayther a narrow income for
one of her appytite and pretensions In an unlucky hour for Shum she
met him He was a widower with a little daughter of three years old
a little house at Pentonwille and a little income about as big as her
own I believe she bullyd the poor creature into marridge and it was
agreed that he should let his groundfloor at John Street and so add
somethink to their means

They married and the widow Buckmaster was the gray mare I can
tell you She was always talking and blustering about her famly the
celebrity of the Buckmasters and the antickety of the Slamcoes They
had a sixroomed house not counting kitching and sculry and now
twelve daughters in all whizz4 Miss Buckmasters Miss Betsy Miss
Dosy Miss Biddy and Miss Winny 1 Miss Shum Mary by name Shums
daughter and seven others who shall be nameless Mrs Shum was a fat
redhaired woman at least a foot taller than S who was but a yard and
a half high palefaced rednosed knockkneed baldheaded his nose
and shutfrill all brown with snuff

Before the house was a little garden where the washin of the famly was
all ways hanging There was so many of em that it was obliged to be
done by relays There was six rails and a stocking on each and four
small goosbry bushes always covered with some bit of linning or other
The hall was a regular puddle wet dabs of dishclouts flapped in your
face soapy smoking bits of flanning went nigh to choke you and while
you were looking up to prevent hanging yourself with the ropes which
were strung across and about slap came the hedge of a pail against your
shins till one was like to be drove mad with hagony The great slattnly
doddling girls was always on the stairs poking about with nasty
flowerpots acooking something or sprawling in the windowseats
with greasy curlpapers reading greasy novels An infernal pianna was
jingling from morning till nighttwo eldest Miss Buckmasters Battle
of Pragsix youngest Miss Shums In my Cottage till I knew every
note in the Battle of Prag and cussed the day when In my Cottage
was rote The younger girls too were always bouncing and thumping
about the house with torn pinnyfores and dogseard grammars and large
pieces of bread and treacle I never see such a house

As for Mrs Shum she was such a fine lady that she did nothink but
lay on the drawingroom sophy read novels drink scold scream and go
into hystarrix Little Shum kep reading an old newspaper from weeks end
to weeks end when he was not engaged in teaching the children or goin
for the beer or cleanin the shoes for they kep no servant This house
in John Street was in short a regular Pandymony

What could have brought Mr Frederic Altamont to dwell in such a place
The reason is hobvius he adoared the fust Miss Shum

And suttnly he did not show a bad taste for though the other daughters
were as ugly as their hideous ma Mary Shum was a pretty little pink
modest creatur with glossy black hair and tender blue eyes and a neck
as white as plaster of Parish She wore a dismal old black gownd which
had grown too short for her and too tight but it only served to show
her pretty angles and feet and bewchus figger Master though he had
looked rather low for the gal of his art had certainly looked in the
right place Never was one more pretty or more hamiable I gav her
always the buttered toast left from our brexfust and a cup of tea or
chocklate as Altamont might fancy and the poor thing was glad enough
of it I can vouch for they had precious short commons up stairs and
she the least of all

For it seemed as if which of the Shum famly should try to snub the poor
thing most There was the four Buckmaster girls always at her It was
Mary git the coalskittle Mary run down to the publichouse for the
beer Mary I intend to wear your clean stockens out walking or your
new bonnet to church Only her poor father was kind to her and he poor
old muff his kindness was of no use Mary bore all the scolding like
a hangel as she was no not if she had a pair of wings and a goold
trumpet could she have been a greater hangel

I never shall forgit one seen that took place It was when Master was
in the city and so having nothink earthly to do I happened to be
listening on the stairs The old scolding was agoing on and the old
tune of that hojus Battle of Prag Old Shum made some remark and Miss
Buckmaster cried out Law pa what a fool you are All the gals began
laffin and so did Mrs Shum all that is excep Mary who turned as
red as flams and going up to Miss Betsy Buckmaster give her two such
wax on her great red ears as made them tingle again

Old Mrs Shum screamed and ran at her like a Bengal tiger Her great
arms vent veeling about like a vinmill as she cuffed and thumped
poor Mary for taking her pas part Mary Shum who was always acrying
before didnt shed a tear now I will do it again she said if
Betsy insults my father New thumps new shreex and the old horridan
went on beatin the poor girl till she was quite exosted and fell down
on the sophy puffin like a poppus

For shame Mary began old Shum for shame you naughty gal you for
hurting the feelings of your dear mamma and beating your kind sister

Why it was because she called you a

If she did you pert miss said Shum looking mighty dignitified I
could correct her and not you

You correct me indeed said Miss Betsy turning up her nose if
possible higher than before I should like to see you erect me
Imperence and they all began laffin again

By this time Mrs S had recovered from the effex of her exsize and she
began to pour in HER wolly Fust she called Mary names then Shum

Oh why screeched she why did I ever leave a genteel famly where
I ad every ellygance and lucksry to marry a creatur like this He is
unfit to be called a man he is unworthy to marry a gentlewoman and as
for that hussy I disown her Thank heaven she ant a Slamcoe she is
only fit to be a Shum

Thats true mamma said all the gals for their mother had taught
them this pretty piece of manners and they despised their father
heartily indeed I have always remarked that in famlies where the wife
is internally talking about the merits of her branch the husband is
invariably a spooney

Well when she was exosted again down she fell on the sofy at her old
trixmore screechingmore convulshuns and she wouldnt stop this
time till Shum had got her half a pint of her old remedy from the
Blue Lion over the way She grew more easy as she finished the gin
but Mary was sent out of the room and told not to come back agin all
day

Miss Mary says Ifor my heart yurned to the poor gal as she came
sobbing and miserable down stairs Miss Mary says I if I might make
so bold heres masters room empty and I know where the cold bif and
pickles is Oh Charles said she nodding her head sadly Im too
retched to have any happytite And she flung herself on a chair and
began to cry fit to bust

At this moment who should come in but my master I had taken hold of
Miss Marys hand somehow and do believe I should have kist it when
as I said Haltamont made his appearance Whats this cries he
lookin at me as black as thunder or as Mr Phillips as Hickit in the
new tragedy of MacBuff

Its only Miss Mary sir answered I

Get out sir says he as fierce as posbil and I felt somethink I
think it was the tip of his to touching me behind and found myself
nex minit sprawling among the wet flannings and buckets and things

The people from up stairs came to see what was the matter as I was
cussin and crying out Its only Charles ma screamed out Miss Betsy

Wheres Mary says Mrs Shum from the sofy

Shes in Masters room miss said I

Shes in the lodgers room ma cries Miss Shum heckoing me

Very good tell her to stay there till he comes back And then Miss
Shum went bouncing up the stairs again little knowing of Haltamonts
return

      

Id long before observed that my master had an anchoring after Mary
Shum indeed as I have said it was purely for her sake that he took
and kep his lodgings at Pentonwille Excep for the sake of love which
is above being mersnary fourteen shillings a wick was a LITTLE too
strong for two such ratholes as he lived in I do blieve the famly
had nothing else but their lodger to live on they brekfisted off his
tealeaves they cut away pounds and pounds of meat from his jints he
always dined at home and his bakers bill was at least enough for six
But that wasnt my business I saw him grin sometimes when I laid down
the cold bif of a morning to see how little was left of yesterdays
sirline but he never said a syllabub for true love dont mind a pound
of meat or so hextra

At first he was very kind and attentive to all the gals Miss Betsy
in partickler grew mighty fond of him they sat for whole evenings
playing cribbitch he taking his pipe and glas she her tea and muffing
but as it was improper for her to come alone she brought one of her
sisters and this was genrally Maryfor he made a pint of asking her
tooand one day when one of the others came instead he told her
very quitely that he hadnt invited her and Miss Buckmaster was too
fond of muffings to try this game on again besides she was jealous of
her three grown sisters and considered Mary as only a child Law bless
us how she used to ogle him and quot bits of pottry and play Meet
Me by Moonlike on an old gitter she reglar flung herself at his head
but he wouldnt have it bein better ockypied elsewhere

One night as genteel as possible he brought home tickets for
Ashleys and proposed to take the two young ladiesMiss Betsy and
Miss Mary in course I recklect he called me aside that afternoon
assuming a solamon and misterus hare Charles said he ARE YOU UP TO
SNUFF

Why sir said I Im genrally considered tolerably downy

Well says he Ill give you half a suffering if you can manage this
bisness for me Ive chose a rainy night on purpus When the theatre is
over you must be waitin with two umbrellows give me one and hold the
other over Miss Buckmaster and hark ye sir TURN TO THE RIGHT when
you leave the theater and say the coach is ordered to stand a little
way up the street in order to get rid of the crowd

We went in a fly hired by Mr A and never shall I forgit Cartliches
hacting on that memrable night Talk of Kimble talk of Magreedy
Ashleys for my money with Cartlitch in the principal part But this
is nothink to the porpus When the play was over I was at the door with
the umbrellos It was raining cats and dogs sure enough

Mr Altamont came out presently Miss Mary under his arm and Miss
Betsy following behind rayther sulky This way sir cries I pushin
forward and I threw a great cloak over Miss Betsy fit to smother her
Mr A and Miss Mary skipped on and was out of sight when Miss Betsys
cloak was settled you may be sure

Theyre only gone to the fly miss Its a little way up the street
away from the crowd of carridges And off we turned TO THE RIGHT and
no mistake

After marchin a little through the plash and mud Has anybody seen
Coxys fly cries I with the most innocent haxent in the world

Coxs fly hollows out one chap Is it the vaggin you want says
another I see the blackin wan pass giggles out another gentlmn and
there was such a hinterchange of compliments as you never heerd I pass
them over though because some of em were not wery genteel

Law miss said I what shall I do My master will never forgive me
and I havent a single sixpence to pay a coach Miss Betsy was just
going to call one when I said that but the coachman wouldnt have it at
that price he said and I knew very well that SHE hadnt four or five
shillings to pay for a wehicle So in the midst of that tarin rain
at midnight we had to walk four miles from Westminster Bridge to
Pentonwille and what was wuss I DIDNT HAPPEN TO KNOW THE WAY A very
nice walk it was and no mistake

At about halfpast two we got safe to John Street My master was at the
garden gate Miss Mary flew into Miss Betsys arms while master begun
cussin and swearing at me for disobeying his orders and TURNING TO THE
RIGHT INSTEAD OF TO THE LEFT Law bless me his hacting of hanger was
very near as natral and as terrybl as Mr Cartlichs in the play

They had waited half an hour he said in the fly in the little street
at the left of the theater they had drove up and down in the greatest
fright possible and at last came home thinking it was in vain to wait
any more They gave her ot rumandwater and roast oysters for supper
and this consoled her a little

I hope nobody will cast an imputation on Miss Mary for HER share in this
adventer for she was as honest a gal as ever lived and I do believe is
hignorant to this day of our little strattygim Besides alls fair in
love and as my master could never get to see her alone on account
of her infernal eleven sisters and ma he took this opportunity of
expressin his attachment to her

If he was in love with her before you may be sure she paid it him back
again now Ever after the night at Ashleys they were as tender as two
tuttledoveswhich fully accounts for the axdent what happened to me
in being kicked out of the room and in course I bore no mallis

I dont know whether Miss Betsy still fancied that my master was in love
with her but she loved muffings and tea and kem down to his parlor as
much as ever

Now comes the singlar part of my history



CHAPTER II


But who was this genlmn with a fine nameMr Frederic Altamont or what
was he The most mysterus genlmn that ever I knew Once I said to him on
a wery rainy day Sir shall I bring the gig down to your office and
he gave me one of his black looks and one of his loudest hoaths and
told me to mind my own bizziness and attend to my orders Another
dayit was on the day when Miss Mary slapped Miss Betsys faceMiss
M who adoared him as I have said already kep on asking him what was
his buth parentidg and ediccation Dear Frederic says she why
this mistry about yourself and your hactions why hide from your little
Marythey were as tender as this I can tell youyour buth and your
professin

I spose Mr Frederic looked black for I was ONLY listening and he
said in a voice hagitated by emotion Mary said he if you love
me ask me this no more let it be sfishnt for you to know that I am a
honest man and that a secret what it would be misery for you to larn
must hang over all my actionsthat is from ten oclock till six

They went on chaffin and talking in this melumcolly and mysterus
way and I didnt lose a word of what they said for them houses in
Pentonwille have only walls made of pasteboard and you hear rayther
better outside the room than in But though he kep up his secret he
swore to her his affektion this day pint blank Nothing should prevent
him he said from leading her to the halter from makin her his
adoarable wife After this was a slight silence Dearest Frederic
mummered out miss speakin as if she was chokin I am yoursyours
for ever And then silence agen and one or two smax as if there
was kissin going on Here I thought it best to give a rattle at the
doorlock for as I live there was old Mrs Shum awalkin down the
stairs

It appears that one of the younger gals alooking out of the bedrum
window had seen my master come in and coming down to tea half an hour
afterwards said so in a cussary way Old Mrs Shum who was a dragon of
vertyou cam bustling down the stairs panting and frowning as fat and
as fierce as a old sow at feedin time

Wheres the lodger fellow says she to me

I spoke loud enough to be heard down the streetIf you mean maam
my master Mr Frederic Altamont esquire hes just stept in and is
puttin on clean shoes in his bedroom

She said nothink in answer but flumps past me and opening the
parlordoor sees master looking very queer and Miss Mary adrooping
down her head like a pale lily

Did you come into my famly says she to corrupt my daughters and to
destroy the hinnocence of that infamous gal Did you come here sir as
a seducer or only as a lodger Speak sir speakand she folded her
arms quite fierce and looked like Mrs Siddums in the Tragic Mews

I came here Mrs Shum said he because I loved your daughter or
I never would have condescended to live in such a beggarly hole I have
treated her in every respect like a genlmn and she is as innocent now
mam as she was when she was born If shell marry me I am ready
if shell leave you she shall have a home where she shall be neither
bullyd nor starved no hangry frumps of sisters no cross motherinlaw
only an affeckshnat husband and all the pure pleasures of Hyming

Mary flung herself into his armsDear dear Frederic says she Ill
never leave you

Miss says Mrs Shum you aint a Slamcoe nor yet a Buckmaster thank
God You may marry this person if your pa thinks proper and he may
insult mebrave metrample on my feelinx in my own houseand theres
noooobody by to defend me

I knew what she was going to be at on came her histarrix agen and she
began screechin and roaring like mad Down comes of course the eleven
gals and old Shum There was a pretty row Look here sir says she
at the conduck of your precious trull of a daughteralone with this
man kissin and dandlin and Lawd knows what besides

What he cries Miss Betsyhe in love with Mary Oh the wretch the
monster the deceiverand she falls down too screeching away as loud
as her mamma for the silly creature fancied still that Altamont had a
fondness for her

SILENCE THESE WOMEN shouts out Altamont thundering loud I love
your daughter Mr Shum I will take her without a penny and can afford
to keep her If you dont give her to me shell come of her own will
Is that enoughmay I have her

Well talk of this matter sir says Mr Shum looking as high and
mighty as an alderman Gals go up stairs with your dear mammaAnd
they all trooped up again and so the skrimmage ended

You may be sure that old Shum was not very sorry to get a husband for
his daughter Mary for the old creatur loved her better than all the
pack which had been brought him or born to him by Mrs Buckmaster But
strange to say when he came to talk of settlements and so forth not
a word would my master answer He said he made four hundred a year
reglarhe wouldnt tell howbut Mary if she married him must share
all that he had and ask no questions only this he would say as hed
said before that he was a honest man

They were married in a few days and took a very genteel house at
Islington but still my master went away to business and nobody knew
where Who could he be



CHAPTER III


If ever a young kipple in the middlin classes began life with a chance
of happiness it was Mr and Mrs Frederic Altamont There house at
Cannon Row Islington was as comfortable as house could be Carpited
from top to to pores rates small furnitur elygant and three
deomestix of which I in course was one My life wasnt so easy as
in Mr As bachelor days but what then The three Ws is my maxum
plenty of work plenty of wittles and plenty of wages Altamont kep his
gig no longer but went to the city in an omlibuster

One would have thought I say that Mrs A with such an effeckshnut
husband might have been as happy as her blessid majisty Nothing of the
sort For the fust six months it was all very well but then she grew
gloomier and gloomier though A did everythink in life to please her

Old Shum used to come reglarly four times a wick to Cannon Row where
he lunched and dined and teed and supd The pore little man was a
thought too fond of wine and spirits and many and manys the night that
Ive had to support him home And you may be sure that Miss Betsy did
not now desert her sister she was at our place mornink noon and
night not much to my maysters liking though he was too goodnatured
to wex his wife in trifles

But Betsy never had forgotten the recollection of old days and hated
Altamont like the foul feind She put all kind of bad things into
the head of poor innocent missis who from being all gayety and
cheerfulness grew to be quite melumcolly and pale and retchid just as
if she had been the most misrable woman in the world

In three months more a baby comes in course and with it old Mrs
Shum who stuck to Mrs side as close as a wampire and made her
retchider and retchider She used to bust into tears when Altamont
came home she used to sigh and wheep over the pore child and say My
child my child your father is false to me or your father deceives
me or what will you do when your pore mother is no more or such
like sentimental stuff

It all came from Mother Shum and her old trix as I soon found out
The fact is when there is a mistry of this kind in the house its a
servants DUTY to listen and listen I did one day when Mrs was cryin
as usual and fat Mrs Shum a sittin consolin her as she called it
though heaven knows she only grew wuss and wuss for the consolation

Well I listened Mrs Shum was arockin the baby and missis cryin as
yousual

Pore dear innocint says Mrs S heavin a great sigh youre the
child of a unknown father and a misrable mother

Dont speak ill of Frederic mamma says missis he is all kindness
to me

All kindness indeed yes he gives you a fine house and a fine gownd
and a ride in a fly whenever you please but WHERE DOES ALL HIS
MONEY COME FROM Who is hewhat is he Who knows that he maynt be a
murderer or a housebreaker or a utterer of forged notes How can he
make his money honestly when he wont say where he gets it Why does he
leave you eight hours every blessid day and wont say where he goes to
Oh Mary Mary you are the most injured of women

And with this Mrs Shum began sobbin and Miss Betsy began yowling like
a cat in a gitter and pore missis cried tootears is so remarkable
infeckshus

Perhaps mamma wimpered out she Frederic is a shopboy and dont
like me to know that he is not a gentleman

A shopboy says Betsy he a shopboy O no no no more likely a
wretched willain of a murderer stabbin and robing all day and feedin
you with the fruits of his illgotten games

More crying and screechin here took place in which the baby joined and
made a very pretty consort I can tell you

He cant be a robber cries missis hes too good too kind for
that besides murdering is done at night and Frederic is always home
at eight

But he can be a forger says Betsy a wicked wicked FORGER Why does
he go away every day to forge notes to be sure Why does he go to
the city to be near banks and places and so do it more at his
convenience

But he brings home a sum of money every dayabout thirty
shillingssometimes fifty and then he smiles and says its a good
days work This is not like a forger said pore Mrs A

I have itI have it screams out Mrs S The villainthe sneaking
doublefaced Jonas hes married to somebody else he is and thats why
he leaves you the base biggymist

At this Mrs Altamont struck all of a heap fainted clean away A
dreadful business it washystarrix then hystarrix in course from
Mrs Shum bells ringin child squalin suvvants tearin up and down
stairs with hot water If ever there is a noosance in the world its a
house where faintain is always goin on I wouldnt live in oneno not
to be groom of the chambers and git two hundred a year

It was eight oclock in the evenin when this row took place and such
a row it was that nobody but me heard masters knock He came in and
heard the hooping and screeching and roaring He seemed very much
frightened at first and said What is it

Mrs Shums here says I and Mrs in astarrix

Altamont looked as black as thunder and growled out a word which I
dont like to namelet it suffice that it begins with a D and ends
with a NATION and he tore up stairs like mad

He bust open the bedroom door missis lay quite pale and stony on the
sofy the babby was screechin from the craddle Miss Betsy was sprawlin
over missis and Mrs Shum half on the bed and half on the ground all
howlin and squeelin like so many dogs at the moond

When A came in the mother and daughter stopped all of a sudding There
had been one or two tiffs before between them and they feared him as if
he had been a hogre

Whats this infernal screeching and crying about says he Oh Mr
Altamont cries the old woman you know too well its about you that
this darling child is misrabble

And why about me pray madam

Why sir dare you ask why Because you deceive her sir because you
are a false cowardly traitor sir because YOU HAVE A WIFE ELSEWHERE
SIR And the old lady and Miss Betsy began to roar again as loud as
ever

Altamont pawsed for a minnit and then flung the door wide open nex he
seized Miss Betsy as if his hand were a vice and he world her out of
the room then up he goes to Mrs S Get up says he thundering loud
you lazy trolloping mischsefmaking lying old fool Get up and get
out of this house You have been the cuss and bain of my happyniss
since you entered it With your dd lies and novvle rending and
histerrix you have perwerted Mary and made her almost as mad as
yourself

My child my child shriex out Mrs Shum and clings round missis But
Altamont ran between them and griping the old lady by her arm dragged
her to the door Follow your daughter mam says he and down she
went CHAWLS SEE THOSE LADIES TO THE DOOR he hollows out and never
let them pass it again We walked down together and off they went and
master locked and doublelocked the bedroom door after him intendin
of course to have a tatortator as they say with his wife You may be
sure that I followed up stairs again pretty quick to hear the result of
their confidence

As they say at St Stevenses it was rayther a stormy debate Mary
says master youre no longer the merry greatful gal I knew and loved
at Pentonwill theres some secret a pressin on youtheres no
smilin welcom for me now as there used formly to be Your mother and
sisterinlaw have perwerted you Mary and thats why Ive drove them
from this house which they shall not reenter in my life

O Frederic its YOU is the cause and not I Why do you have any
mistry from me Where do you spend your days Why did you leave me
even on the day of your marridge for eight hours and continue to do so
every day

Because says he I makes my livelihood by it I leave you and dont
tell you HOW I make it for it would make you none the happier to know

It was in this way the convysation ren onmore tears and questions on
my missises part more sturmness and silence on my masters it ended
for the first time since their marridge in a reglar quarrel Wery
difrent I can tell you from all the hammerous billing and kewing which
had proceeded their nupshuls

Master went out slamming the door in a fury as well he might Says he
If I cant have a comforable life I can have a jolly one and so
he went off to the hed tavern and came home that evening beesly
intawsicated When high words begin in a family drink generally follows
on the genlmans side and then fearwell to all conjubial happyniss
These two pipple so fond and loving were now sirly silent and full
of il wil Master went out earlier and came home later missis cried
more and looked even paler than before

Well things went on in this uncomfortable way master still in the
mopes missis tempted by the deamons of jellosy and curosity until a
singlar axident brought to light all the goings on of Mr Altamont

It was the tenth of January I recklect the day for old Shum gev me
half a crownd the fust and last of his money I ever see by the way
he was dining along with master and they were making merry together

Master said as he was mixing his fifth tumler of punch and little Shum
his twelfth or somaster said I see you twice in the City today Mr
Shum

Well thats curous says Shum I WAS in the City Todays the day
when the divvydins God bless em is paid and me and Mrs S went for
our halfyears inkem But we only got out of the coach crossed the
street to the Bank took our money and got in agen How could you see
me twice

Altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd and hawd O says he I
was passingpassing as you went in and out And he instantly turned
the conversation and began talking about pollytix or the weather or
some such stuff

Yes my dear said my missis but how could you see papa TWICE
Master didnt answer but talked pollytix more than ever Still she
would continy on Where was you my dear when you saw pa What were
you doing my love to see pa twice and so forth Master looked
angrier and angrier and his wife only pressed him wuss and wuss

This was as I said little Shums twelfth tumler and I knew pritty
well that he could git very little further for as reglar as the
thirteenth came Shum was drunk The thirteenth did come and its
consquinzes I was obliged to leed him home to John Street where I left
him in the hangry arms of Mrs Shum

How the d sayd he all the way how the dddthe
deddydeddydevilcould he have seen me TWICE



CHAPTER IV


It was a sad slip on Altamonts part for no sooner did he go out the
next morning than missis went out too She tor down the street and
never stopped till she came to her pas house at Pentonwill She was
clositid for an hour with her ma and when she left her she drove
straight to the City She walked before the Bank and behind the Bank
and round the Bank she came home disperryted having learned nothink

And it was now an extraordinary thing that from Shums house for the
next ten days there was nothing but expyditions into the city Mrs
S tho her dropsicle legs had never carred her half so fur before was
eternally on the key veve as the French say If she didnt go Miss
Betsy did or misses did they seemed to have an attrackshun to the
Bank and went there as natral as an omlibus

At last one day old Mrs Shum comes to our houseshe wasnt admitted
when master was there but came still in his absintsand she wore a
hair of tryumph as she entered Mary says she where is the money
your husbind brought to you yesterday My master used always to give it
to missis when he returned

The money ma says Mary Why here And pulling out her puss she
showed a sovrin a good heap of silver and an oddlooking little coin

THATS IT thats it cried Mrs S A Queene Annes sixpence isnt
it deardated seventeen hundred and three

It was so sure enough a Queen Ans sixpence of that very date

Now my love says she I have found him Come with me tomorrow and
you shall KNOW ALL

And now comes the end of my story

      

The ladies nex morning set out for the City and I walked behind doing
the genteel thing with a nosegy and a goold stick We walked down the
New Roadwe walked down the City Roadwe walked to the Bank We were
crossing from that heddyfiz to the other side of Cornhill when all of a
sudden missis shreeked and fainted spontaceously away

I rushed forrard and raised her to my arms spiling thereby a new
weskit and a pair of crimson smalcloes I rushed forrard I say very
nearly knocking down the old sweeper who was hobbling away as fast as
posibil We took her to Birchs we provided her with a hackneycoach
and every lucksury and carried her home to Islington

      

That night master never came home Nor the nex night nor the nex
On the fourth day an octioneer arrived he took an infantry of the
furnitur and placed a bill in the window

At the end of the wick Altamont made his appearance He was haggard and
pale not so haggard however not so pale as his miserable wife

He looked at her very tendrilly I may say its from him that I coppied
MY look to Miss  He looked at her very tendrilly and held out his
arms She gev a suffycating shreek and rusht into his umbraces

Mary says he you know all now I have sold my place I have got
three thousand pounds for it and saved two more Ive sold my house
and furnitur and that brings me another Well go abroad and love each
other has formly

And now you ask me Who he was I shudder to relateMr Haltamont SWEP
THE CROSSING FROM THE BANK TO CORNHILL

Of cors I left his servis I met him few years after at
BaddenBadden where he and Mrs A were much respectid and pass for
pipple of propaty




THE AMOURS OF MR DEUCEACE


DIMOND CUT DIMOND


The name of my nex master was if posbil still more ellygant and
youfonious than that of my fust I now found myself boddy servant to the
Honrabble Halgernon Percy Deuceace youngest and fifth son of the Earl
of Crabs

Halgernon was a barrystirthat is he lived in Pump Cort Temple a
wulgar naybrood witch praps my readers dont no Suffiz to say its on
the confines of the citty and the choasen aboad of the lawyers of this
metrappolish

When I say that Mr Deuceace was a barrystir I dont mean that he
went sesshums or surcoats as they call em but simply that he kep
chambers lived in Pump Cort and looked out for a commitionarship or
a revisinship or any other place that the Wig guvvyment could give
him His father was a Wig pier as the landriss told me and had been
a Toary pier The fack is his lordship was so poar that he would be
anythink or nothink to get provisions for his sons and an inkum for
himself

I phansy that he aloud Halgernon two hundred a year and it would have
been a very comforable maintenants only he knever paid him

Owever the young genlmn was a genlmn and no mistake he got his
allowents of nothing a year and spent it in the most honrabble and
fashnabble manner He kep a kabhe went to Holmaxand Crockfudshe
moved in the most xquizzit suckles and trubbld the law boox very little
I can tell you Those fashnabble gents have ways of getten money witch
comman pipple doant understand

Though he only had a therd floar in Pump Cort he lived as if he had
the welth of Cresas The tenpun notes floo abowt as common as
haypinceclarrit and shampang was at his house as vulgar as gin and
verry glad I was to be sure to be a valley to a zion of the nobillaty

Deuceace had in his sittinroom a large pictur on a sheet of paper
The names of his family was wrote on it it was wrote in the shape of
a tree agroin out of a maninarmers stomick and the names were on
little plates among the bows The pictur said that the Deuceaces kem
into England in the year 1066 along with William Conqueruns My master
called it his podygree I do bleev it was because he had this pictur
and because he was the HONRABBLE Deuceace that he mannitched to live
as he did If he had been a common man youd have said he was no
better than a swinler Its only rank and buth that can warrant such
singularities as my master showd For its no use disgysing itthe
Honrabble Halgernon was a GAMBLER For a man of wulgar family its the
wust trade that can befor a man of common feelinx of honesty this
profession is quite imposbil but for a real thoroughbread genlmn its
the esiest and most prophetable line he can take

It may praps appear curious that such a fashnabble man should live in
the Temple but it must be recklected that its not only lawyers who
live in whats called the Ins of Cort Many batchylers who have nothink
to do with lor have here their loginx and many sham barrysters who
never put on a wig and gownd twise in their lives kip apartments in the
Temple instead of Bon Street Pickledilly or other fashnabble places

Frinstance on our stairkis so these houses are called there was
8 sets of chamberses and only 3 lawyers These was bottom floar
Screwson Hewson and Jewson attorneys fust floar Mr Sergeant
Flabberopsite Mr Counslor Bruffy and secknd pair Mr Haggerstony
an Irish counslor praktising at the Old Baly and lickwise what they
call reporter to the Morning Post nyouspapper Opsite him was wrote


 MR RICHARD BLEWITT


and on the thud floar with my master lived one Mr Dawkins

This young fellow was a new comer into the Temple and unlucky it was
for him toohed better have never been born for its my firm apinion
that the Temple ruined himthat is with the help of my master and Mr
Dick Blewitt as you shall hear

Mr Dawkins as I was gave to understand by his young man had just left
the Universary of Oxford and had a pretty little fortn of his ownsix
thousand pound or soin the stox He was jest of age an orfin who
had lost his father and mother and having distinkwished hisself at
Collitch where he gained seffral prices was come to town to push his
fortn and study the barrysters bisness

Not bein of a very high fammly hisselfindeed Ive heard say his
father was a chismonger or somethink of that lo sortDawkins was glad
to find his old Oxford frend Mr Blewitt yonger son to rich Squire
Blewitt of Listershire and to take rooms so near him

Now tho there was a considdrable intimacy between me and Mr Blewitts
gentleman there was scarcely any betwixt our mastersmine being
too much of the aristoxy to associate with one of Mr Blewitts sort
Blewitt was what they call a bettin man he went reglar to Tattlesalls
kep a pony wore a white hat a blue berdseye handkercher and a
cutaway coat In his manners he was the very contrary of my master who
was a slim ellygant man as ever I seehe had very white hands rayther
a sallow face with sharp dark ise and small wiskus neatly trimmed and
as black as Warrens jethe spoke very low and softhe seemed to be
watchin the person with whom he was in convysation and always flatterd
everybody As for Blewitt he was quite of another sort He was always
swearin singing and slappin people on the back as hearty as posbill
He seemed a merry careless honest cretur whom one would trust with
life and soul So thought Dawkins at least who though a quiet young
man fond of his boox novvles Byrons poems footplaying and such
like scientafic amusemints grew hand in glove with honest Dick Blewitt
and soon after with my master the Honrabble Halgernon Poor Daw he
thought he was makin good connexions and real frendshe had fallen in
with a couple of the most etrocious swinlers that ever lived

Before Mr Dawkinss arrivial in our house Mr Deuceace had barely
condysended to speak to Mr Blewitt it was only about a month after
that suckumstance that my master all of a sudding grew very friendly
with him The reason was pretty clearDeuceace WANTED HIM Dawkins had
not been an hour in masters company before he knew that he had a pidgin
to pluck

Blewitt knew this too and bein very fond of pidgin intended to
keep this one entirely to himself It was amusin to see the Honrabble
Halgernon manuvring to get this poor bird out of Blewitts clause who
thought he had it safe In fact hed brought Dawkins to these chambers
for that very porpos thinking to have him under his eye and strip him
at leisure

My master very soon found out what was Mr Blewitts game Gamblers
know gamblers if not by instink at least by reputation and though Mr
Blewitt moved in a much lower speare than Mr Deuceace they knew each
others dealins and caracters puffickly well

Charles you scoundrel says Deuceace to me one day he always spoak in
that kind way who is this person that has taken the opsit chambers
and plays the flute so industrusly

Its Mr Dawkins a rich young gentleman from Oxford and a great
friend of Mr Blewittses sir says I they seem to live in each
others rooms

Master said nothink but he GRINDmy eye how he did grin Not the
fowl find himself could snear more satannickly

I knew what he meant

Imprimish A man who plays the floot is a simpleton

Secknly Mr Blewitt is a raskle

Thirdmo When a raskle and a simpleton is always together and when the
simpleton is RICH one knows pretty well what will come of it

I was but a lad in them days but I knew what was what as well as my
master its not gentlemen only thats up to snough Law bless us there
was four of us on this stairkes four as nice young men as you ever see
Mr Bruffys young man Mr Dawkinses Mr Blewitts and meand
we knew what our masters was about as well as thay did theirselfs
Frinstance I can say this for MYSELF there wasnt a paper in
Deuceaces desk or drawer not a bill a note or mimerandum which I
hadnt read as well as he with Blewitts it was the sameme and his
young man used to read em all There wasnt a bottle of wine that we
didnt get a glass out of nor a pound of sugar that we didnt have some
lumps of it We had keys to all the cubbardswe pipped into all the
letters that kem and wentwe pored over all the billfileswed the
best pickens out of the dinners the livvers of the fowls the forcemit
balls out of the soup the egs from the sallit As for the coals
and candles we left them to the landrisses You may call this
robrynonsinceits only our rightsa suvvants purquizzits is as
sacred as the laws of Hengland

Well the long and short of it is this Richard Blewitt esquire was
sityouated as follows Hed an incum of three hundred a year from his
father Out of this he had to pay one hundred and ninety for money
borrowed by him at collidge seventy for chambers seventy more for his
hoss aty for his suvvant on bord wagis and about three hundred and
fifty for a sepparat establishment in the Regency Park besides this
his pockitmoney say a hunderd his eatin drinkin and winemarchants
bill about two hunderd moar So that you see he laid by a pretty
handsome sum at the end of the year

My master was diffrent and being a more fashnable man than Mr B in
course he owed a deal more mony There was fust


 Account contray at Crockfords L 3711 0 0
 Bills of xchange and I O Us but he
 didnt pay these in most cases 4963 0 0
 21 tailors bills in all 1306 11 9
 3 hossdealers do 402 0 0
 2 coachbuilder 506 0 0
 Bills contracted at Cambridtch 2193 6 8
 Sundries 987 10 0
 
 L 14069 8 5


I give this as a curositypipple doant know how in many cases
fashnabble life is carried on and to know even what a real gnlmn OWES
is somethink instructif and agreeable

But to my tail The very day after my master had made the inquiries
concerning Mr Dawkins witch I mentioned already he met Mr Blewitt on
the stairs and byoutiffle it was to see how this gnlmn who had before
been almost cut by my master was now received by him One of
the sweetest smiles I ever saw was now vizzable on Mr Deuceaces
countenance He held out his hand covered with a white kid glove and
said in the most frenly tone of vice posbill What Mr Blewitt It is
an age since we met What a shame that such near naybors should see each
other so seldom

Mr Blewitt who was standing at his door in a pegreen dressinggown
smoakin a segar and singing a hunting coarus looked surprised
flattered and then suspicious

Why yes says he it is Mr Deuceace a long time

Not I think since we dined at Sir George Hookeys Bytheby what
an evening that washay Mr Blewitt What wine what capital songs I
recollect your Mayday in the morningcuss me the best comick song
I ever heard I was speaking to the Duke of Doncaster about it only
yesterday You know the duke I think

Mr Blewitt said quite surly No I dont

Not know him cries master why hang it Blewitt he knows YOU as
every sporting man in England does I should think Why man your good
things are in everybodys mouth at Newmarket

And so master went on chaffin Mr Blewitt That genlmn at fust answered
him quite short and angry but after a little more flummery he grew as
pleased as posbill took in all Deuceaces flatry and bleeved all
his lies At last the door shut and they both went into Mr Blewitts
chambers together

Of course I cant say what past there but in an hour master kem up to
his own room as yaller as mustard and smellin sadly of backo smoke I
never see any genmln more sick than he was HED BEEN SMOAKIN SEAGARS
along with Blewitt I said nothink in course tho Id often heard him
xpress his horrow of backo and knew very well he would as soon swallow
pizon as smoke But he wasnt a chap to do a thing without a reason if
hed been smoakin I warrant he had smoked to some porpus

I didnt hear the convysation betwean em but Mr Blewitts man did
it wasWell Mr Blewitt what capital seagars Have you one for
a friend to smoak The old fox it wasnt only the SEAGARS he was
asmoakin Walk in says Mr Blewitt and they began a chaffin
together master very ankshous about the young gintleman who had come
to live in our chambers Mr Dawkins and always coming back to that
subjectsaying that people on the same stairkis ot to be frenly how
glad hed be for his part to know Mr Dick Blewitt and ANY FRIEND OF
HIS and so on Mr Dick howsever seamed quite aware of the trap
laid for him I really dont know this Dawkins says he hes a
chismongers son I hear and tho Ive exchanged visits with him I
doant intend to continyou the acquaintancenot wishin to assoshate
with that kind of pipple So they went on master fishin and Mr
Blewitt not wishin to take the hook at no price

Confound the vulgar thief muttard my master as he was laying on his
sophy after being so very ill Ive poisoned myself with his infernal
tobacco and he has foiled me The cursed swindling boor he thinks
hell ruin this poor Cheesemonger does he Ill step in and WARN
him

I thought I should bust alaffin when he talked in this style I knew
very well what his warning meantlockin the stabledoor but stealin
the hoss fust

Next day his strattygam for becoming acquainted with Mr Dawkins we
exicuted and very pritty it was

Besides potry and the flute Mr Dawkins I must tell you had some
other parshallitieswiz he was very fond of good eatin and drinkin
After doddling over his music and boox all day this young genlmn used
to sally out of evenings dine sumptiously at a tavern drinkin all
sorts of wine along with his friend Mr Blewitt He was a quiet young
fellow enough at fust but it was Mr B who for his own porpuses no
doubt had got him into this kind of life Well I neednt say that he
who eats a fine dinner and drinks too much overnight wants a bottle
of sodawater and a gril praps in the morning Such was Mr Dawkinses
case and reglar almost as twelve oclock came the waiter from Dix
CoffyHouse was to be seen on our stairkis bringing up Mr Ds hot
breakfast

No man would have thought there was anythink in such a trifling
cirkumstance master did though and pounced upon it like a cock on a
barlycorn

He sent me out to Mr Morells in Pickledilly for wots called a
Strasbugpiein French a patty defau graw He takes a card and
nails it on the outside case patty defaw graws come generally in a
round wooden box like a drumb and what do you think he writes on it
why as follosFor the Honorable Algernon Percy Deuceace c c c
With Prince Talleyrands compliments

Prince Tallyrams complimints indeed I laff when I think of it still
the old surpint He WAS a surpint that Deuceace and no mistake

Well by a most extrornary piece of illluck the nex day punctially
as Mr Dawkinses brexfas was coming UP the stairs Mr Halgernon Percy
Deuceace was going DOWN He was as gay as a lark humming an Oppra tune
and twizzting round his head his hevy goldheaded cane Down he went
very fast and by a most unlucky axdent struck his cane against the
waiters tray and away went Mr Dawkinses gril kayann kitchup
sodawater and all I cant think how my master should have choas such
an exact time to be sure his windo looked upon the court and he could
see every one who came into our door

As soon as the axdent had took place master was in such a rage as to
be sure no man ever was in befor he swoar at the waiter in the most
dreddfle way he threatened him with his stick and it was only when he
see that the waiter was rayther a bigger man than hisself that he was
in the least pazzyfied He returned to his own chambres and John the
waiter went off for more gril to Dixes Coffyhouse

This is a most unlucky axdent to be sure Charles says master to me
after a few minits paws during witch he had been and wrote a note
put it into an anvelope and sealed it with his big seal of arms But
staya thought strikes metake this note to Mr Dawkins and that pye
you brought yesterday and hearkye you scoundrel if you say where you
got it I will break every bone in your skin

These kind of promises were among the few which I knew him to keep and
as I loved boath my skinn and my boans I carried the noat and of cors
said nothink Waiting in Mr Dawkinses chambus for a few minnits I
returned to my master with an anser I may as well give both of these
documence of which I happen to have taken coppies

 THE HON A P DEUCEACE TO T S DAWKINS ESQ

 TEMPLE Tuesday

 Mr DEUCEACE presents his compliments to Mr Dawkins and begs at
 the same time to offer his most sincere apologies and regrets for
 the accident which has just taken place

 May Mr Deuceace be allowed to take a neighbors privilege and to
 remedy the evil he has occasioned to the best of his power if Mr
 Dawkins will do him the favor to partake of the contents of the
 accompanying case from Strasbourg direct and the gift of a
 friend on whose taste as a gourmand Mr Dawkins may rely perhaps
 he will find that it is not a bad substitute for the plat which Mr
 Deuceaces awkwardness destroyed

 It will also Mr Deuceace is sure be no small gratification to
 the original donor of the pate when he learns that it has fallen
 into the hands of so celebrated a bon vivant as Mr Dawkins

 MR THOMAS SMITH DAWKINS presents his grateful compliments to the
 Hon Mr Deuceace and accepts with the greatest pleasure Mr
 Deuceaces generous proffer

 It would be one of the HAPPIEST MOMENTS of Mr Smith Dawkinss
 life if the Hon Mr Deuceace would EXTEND HIS GENEROSITY still
 further and condescend to partake of the repast which his
 MUNIFICENT POLITENESS has furnished

 TEMPLE Tuesday


Many and many a time I say have I grind over these letters which
I had wrote from the original by Mr Bruffys copyin clark Deuceaces
flam about Prince Tallyram was puffickly successful I saw young Dawkins
blush with delite as he red the note he toar up for or five sheets
before he composed the answer to it which was as you red abuff and
roat in a hand quite trembling with pleasyer If you could but have seen
the look of triumph in Deuceaces wicked black eyes when he read the
noat I never see a deamin yet but I can phansy 1 a holding a writhing
soal on his pitchfrock and smilin like Deuceace He dressed himself in
his very best clothes and in he went after sending me over to say that
he would except with pleasyour Mr Dawkinss invite

The pie was cut up and a most frenly conversation begun betwixt the two
genlmin Deuceace was quite captivating He spoke to Mr Dawkins in
the most respeckful and flatrin manneragread in every think he
saidprazed his taste his furniter his coat his classick nolledge
and his playin on the floot youd have thought to hear him that such
a polygon of exlens as Dawkins did not breaththat such a modist
sinsear honrabble genlmn as Deuceace was to be seen nowhere xcept
in Pump Cort Poor Daw was complitly taken in My master said hed
introduce him to the Duke of Doncaster and heaven knows how many nobs
more till Dawkins was quite intawsicated with pleasyour I know as a
fac and it pretty well shows the young genlmns carryter that he went
that very day and ordered 2 new coats on porpos to be introjuiced to
the lords in

But the best joak of all was at last Singin swagrin and swarinkup
stares came Mr Dick Blewitt He flung opn Mr Dawkinss door shouting
out Daw my old buck how are you when all of a sudden he sees Mr
Deuceace his jor dropt he turned chocky white and then burnin red
and looked as if a stror would knock him down My dear Mr Blewitt
says my master smilin and offring his hand how glad I am to see you
Mr Dawkins and I were just talking about your pony Pray sit down

Blewitt did and now was the question who should sit the other out but
law bless you Mr Blewitt was no match for my master all the time he
was fidgetty silent and sulky on the contry master was charmin
I never herd such a flo of conversatin or so many wittacisms as he
uttered At last completely beat Mr Blewitt took his leaf that
instant master followed him and passin his arm through that of Mr
Dick led him into our chambers and began talkin to him in the most
affabl and affeckshnat manner

But Dick was too angry to listen at last when master was telling him
some long story about the Duke of Doncaster Blewitt burst out

A plague on the Duke of Doncaster Come come Mr Deuceace dont
you be running your rigs upon me I aint the man to be bamboozld by
longwinded stories about dukes and duchesses You think I dont know
you every man knows you and your line of country Yes youre after
young Dawkins there and think to pluck him but you shantno
by  you shant The reader must recklect that the oaths which
interspussed Mr Bs convysation I have left out Well after hed
fired a wolley of em Mr Deuceace spoke as cool as possbill

Hark ye Blewitt I know you to be one of the most infernal thieves and
scoundrels unhung If you attempt to hector with me I will cane you if
you want more Ill shoot you if you meddle between me and Dawkins I
will do both I know your whole life you miserable swindler and coward
I know you have already won two hundred pounds of this lad and want
all I will have half or you never shall have a penny Its quite true
that master knew things but how was the wonder

I couldnt see Mr Bs face during this dialogue bein on the wrong
side of the door but there was a considdrable paws after thuse
complymints had passed between the two genlmnone walkin quickly up
and down the roomtother angry and stupid sittin down and stampin
with his foot

Now listen to this Mr Blewitt continues master at last If youre
quiet you shall have half this fellows money but venture to win a
shilling from him in my absence or without my consent and you do it at
your peril

Well well Mr Deuceace cries Dick its very hard and I must say
not fair the game was of my startin and youve no right to interfere
with my friend

Mr Blewitt you are a fool You professed yesterday not to know this
man and I was obliged to find him out for myself I should like to know
by what law of honor I am bound to give him up to you

It was charmin to hear this pair of raskles talkin about HONOR I
declare I could have found it in my heart to warn young Dawkins of the
precious way in which these chaps were going to serve him But if THEY
didnt know what honor was I did and never never did I tell tails
about my masters when in their sarviceOUT in cors the hobligation is
no longer binding

Well the nex day there was a gran dinner at our chambers White soop
turbit and lobstir sos saddil of Scoch muttn grous and MArony
wines shampang hock maderia a bottle of poart and ever so many

thus Mr Dawkins had won 2 pounds Mr Blewitt 30 shillings the
Honrabble Mr Deuceace having lost 3L l0s After the devvle and the
shampang the play was a little higher Now it was pound pints and five
pound the bet I thought to be sure after hearing the complymints
between Blewitt and master in the morning that now poor Dawkinss time
was come

Not so Dawkins won always Mr B betting on his play and giving him
the very best of advice At the end of the evening which was abowt five
oclock the nex morning they stopt Master was counting up the skore on
a card

Blewitt says he Ive been unlucky I owe you let me seeyes
fiveandforty pounds

Fiveandforty says Blewitt and no mistake

I will give you a cheque says the honrabble genlmn

Oh dont mention it my dear sir But master got a grate sheet
of paper and drew him a check on Messeers Pump Algit and Co his
bankers

Now says master Ive got to settle with you my dear Mr Dawkins
If you had backd your luck I should have owed you a very handsome sum
of money Voyons thirteen points at a poundit is easy to calculate
and drawin out his puss he clinked over the table 13 goolden suverings
which shon till they made my eyes wink

So did pore Dawkinses as he put out his hand all trembling and drew
them in

Let me say added master let me say and Ive had some little
experience that you are the very best ecarte player with whom I ever
sat down

Dawkinses eyes glissened as he put the money up and said Law
Deuceace you flatter me

FLATTER him I should think he did It was the very think which master
ment

But mind you Dawkins continyoud he I must have my revenge for Im
ruinedpositively ruined by your luck

Well well says Mr Thomas Smith Dawkins as pleased as if he had
gained a millium shall it be tomorrow Blewitt what say you

Mr Blewitt agreed in course My master after a little demurring
consented too Well meet says he at your chambers But mind my
dear fello not too much wine I cant stand it at any time especially
when I have to play ecarte with YOU

Pore Dawkins left our rooms as happy as a prins Here Charles says
he and flung me a sovring Pore fellow pore fellow I knew what was
acomin

But the best of it was that these 13 sovrings which Dawkins won MASTER
HAD BORROWED THEM FROM MR BLEWITT I brought em with 7 more from
that young genlmns chambers that very morning for since his interview
with master Blewitt had nothing to refuse him


Well shall I continue the tail If Mr Dawkins had been the least bit
wiser it would have taken him six months befoar he lost his money as
it was he was such a confunded ninny that it took him a very short
time to part with it

Nex day it was Thursday and masters acquaintance with Mr Dawkins
had only commenced on Tuesday Mr Dawkins as I said gev his
partydinner at 7 Mr Blewitt and the two Mr Ds as befoar Play
begins at 11 This time I knew the bisness was pretty serious for
we suvvants was packed off to bed at 2 oclock On Friday I went to
chambersno masterhe kem in for 5 minutes at about 12 made a little
toilit ordered more devvles and sodawater and back again he went to
Mr Dawkinss

They had dinner there at 7 again but nobody seamed to eat for all the
vittles came out to us genlmn they had in more wine though and must
have drunk at least two dozen in the 36 hours

At ten oclock however on Friday night back my master came to his
chambers I saw him as I never saw him before namly reglar drunk He
staggered about the room he danced he hickipd he swoar he flung me
a heap of silver and finely he sunk down exosted on his bed I pullin
off his boots and close and making him comfrabble

When I had removed his garmints I did what its the duty of every
servant to doI emtied his pockits and looked at his pockitbook and
all his letters a number of axdents have been prevented that way

I found there among a heap of things the following pretty dockyment


 I O U
 L 4700
 THOMAS SMITH DAWKINS
 Friday 16th January


There was another bit of paper of the same kindI 0 U four hundred
pounds Richard Blewitt but this in corse ment nothink

      

Nex mornin at nine master was up and as sober as a judg He drest
and was off to Mr Dawkins At ten he ordered a cab and the two
gentlmn went together

Where shall he drive sir says I

Oh tell him to drive to THE BANK

Pore Dawkins his eyes red with remors and sleepliss drunkenniss gave a
shudder and a sob as he sunk back in the wehicle and they drove on

That day he sold out every hapny he was worth xcept five hundred
pounds

      

Abowt 12 master had returned and Mr Dick Blewitt came stridin up the
stairs with a sollum and important hair

Is your master at home says he

Yes sir says I and in he walks I in coars with my ear to the
keyhole listning with all my mite

Well says Blewitt we maid a pretty good night of it Mr Deuceace
Yuve settled I see with Dawkins

Settled says master Oh yesyesIve settled with him

Four thousand seven hundred I think

About thatyes

That makes my sharelet me seetwo thousand three hundred and fifty
which Ill thank you to fork out

Upon my wordwhyMr Blewitt says master I dont really
understand what you mean

YOU DONT KNOW WHAT I MEAN says Blewitt in an axent such as I never
before heard You dont know what I mean Did you not promise me that
we were to go shares Didnt I lend you twenty sovereigns the other
night to pay our losings to Dawkins Didnt you swear on your honor as
a gentleman to give me half of all that might be won in this affair

Agreed sir says Deuceace agreed

Well sir and now what have you to say

Why THAT I DONT INTEND TO KEEP MY PROMISE You infernal fool and
ninny do you suppose I was laboring for YOU Do you fancy I was going
to the expense of giving a dinner to that jackass yonder that
you should profit by it Get away sir Leave the room sir Or
stophereI will give you four hundred poundsyour own note of hand
sir for that sum if you will consent to forget all that has passed
between us and that you have never known Mr Algernon Deuceace

Ive seen pipple angery before now but never any like Blewitt He
stormed groaned belloed swoar At last he fairly began blubbring
now cussing and nashing his teeth now praying dear Mr Deuceace to
grant him mercy

At last master flung open the door heaven bless us its well I didnt
tumble hed over eels into the room and said Charles show the
gentleman down stairs My master looked at him quite steddy Blewitt
slunk down as misrabble as any man I ever see As for Dawkins heaven
knows where he was

      

Charles says my master to me about an hour afterwards Im going to
Paris you may come too if you please




FORING PARTS


It was a singular proof of my masters modesty that though he had won
this andsome sum of Mr Dawkins and was inclined to be as extravygant
and osntatious as any man I ever seed yet when he determined on going
to Paris he didnt let a single frend know of all them winnings of his
didnt acquaint my Lord Crabs his father that he was about to leave
his natiff shoarsneighdidnt even so much as call together his
tradesmin and pay off their little bills befor his departure

On the contry Chawles said he to me stick a piece of paper on my
door which is the way that lawyers do and write Back at seven
upon it Back at seven I wrote and stuck it on our outer oak And so
mistearus was Deuceace about his continental tour to all except me
that when the landriss brought him her account for the last month
amountain at the very least to 2L 10s master told her to leave it
till Monday morning when it should be properly settled Its extrodny
how ickonomical a man becomes when hes got five thousand lbs in his
pockit

Back at 7 indeed At 7 we were aroalin on the Dover Road in the
Reglator Coachmaster inside me out A strange company of people there
was too in that wehicle3 sailors an Italyin with his musicbox and
munky a missionary going to convert the heathens in France 2 oppra
girls they call em figureaunts and the figureaunts mothers
inside 4 Frenchmin with gingybred caps and mustashes singing
chattering and jesticklating in the most vonderful vay Such
compliments as passed between them and the figureaunts such a munshin
of biskits and sippin of brandy such O mong Jews and O sacrrres
and kill fay frwaws I didnt understand their languidge at that time
so of course cant igsplain much of their conwersation but it pleased
me nevertheless for now I felt that I was reely going into foring
parts which ever sins I had had any edication at all was always my
fondest wish Heavin bless us thought I if these are specimeens of
all Frenchmen what a set they must be The pore Italyins monky sittin
mopin and meluncolly on his box was not half so ugly and seamed quite
as reasonabble

Well we arrived at DoverShip Hotel weal cutlets half a ginny
glas of ale a shilling glas of neagush half a crownd a hapnyworth of
waxlites four shillings and so on But master paid without grumbling
as long as it was for himself he never minded the expens and nex day we
embarked in the packit for Balong sirmarewhich means in French the
town of Balong sityouated on the sea I who had heard of foring
wonders expected this to be the fust and greatest phansy then my
disapintment when we got there to find this Balong not situated on
the sea but on the SHOAR

But oh the gettin there was the bisniss How I did wish for Pump Court
agin as we were tawsing abowt in the Channel Gentle reader av you
ever been on the otionThe sea the sea the open sea as Barry
Cromwell says As soon as we entered our little wessel and Id
looked to masters luggitch and mine mine was rapt up in a very small
hankercher as soon I say as we entered our little wessel as soon
as I saw the waives black and frothy like fresh drawn porter adashin
against the ribs of our galliant bark the keal like a wedge splittin
the billoes in two the sales aflaffin in the hair the standard of
Hengland floating at the maskhead the steward agetting ready the
basins and things the capting proudly tredding the deck and giving
orders to the salers the white rox of Albany and the bathinmasheens
disappearing in the distansthen then I felt for the first time
the mite the madgisty of existence Yellowplush my boy said I in a
dialogue with myself your life is now about to commensyour carear
as a man dates from your entrans on board this packit Be wise be
manly be cautious forgit the follies of your youth You are no longer
a boy now but a FOOTMAN Throw down your tops your marbles your
boyish gamesthrow off your childish habbits with your inky clerks
jackitthrow up your

      

Here I recklect I was obleeged to stopp A fealin in the fust place
singlar in the next place painful and at last compleatly overpowering
had come upon me while I was making the abuff speach and now I found
myself in a sityouation which Dellixy for Bids me to describe Suffis to
say that now I dixcovered what basins was made forthat for many many
hours I lay in a hagony of exostion dead to all intense and porpuses
the rain pattering in my face the salers tramplink over my bodythe
panes of purgatory going on inside When wed been about four hours in
this sityouation it seamd to me four ears the steward comes to that
part of the deck where we servants were all huddled up together and
calls out Charles

Well says I gurgling out a faint yes whats the matter

Youre wanted

Where

Your masters wery ill says he with a grin

Master be hanged says I turning round more misrable than ever I
woodnt have moved that day for twenty thousand mastersno not for the
Empror of Russia or the Pop of Room

Well to cut this sad subjik short many and many a voyitch have I sins
had upon what Shakspur calls the wasty dip but never such a retched
one as that from Dover to Balong in the year Anna Domino 1818 Steemers
were scarce in those days and our journey was made in a smack At last
when I was in a stage of despare and exostion as reely to phansy myself
at Deaths doar we got to the end of our journey Late in the evening
we hailed the Gaelic shoars and hankered in the arbor of Balong
sirmare

It was the entrans of Parrowdice to me and master and as we entered the
calm water and saw the comfrabble lights gleaming in the houses and
felt the roal of the vessel degreasing never was two mortials gladder
I warrant than we were At length our capting drew up at the key and
our journey was down But such a bustle and clatter such jabbering
such shrieking and swaring such wollies of oafs and axicrations as
saluted us on landing I never knew We were boarded in the fust place
by customhouse officers in cockhats who seased our luggitch and
called for our passpots then a crowd of innwaiters came tumbling and
screaming on deckDis way sare cries one Hotel Meurice says
another Hotel de Bang screeches another chapthe tower of Babyle
was nothink to it The fust thing that struck me on landing was a
big fellow with earrings who very nigh knock me down in wrenching
masters carpetbag out of my hand as I was carrying it to the hotell
But we got to it safe at last and for the fust time in my life I slep
in a foring country

I shant describe this town of Balong which as it has been visited by
not less on an avaridg than two milliums of English since I fust
saw it twenty years ago is tolrabbly well known already Its a dingy
melumcolly place to my mind the only thing moving in the streets is
the gutter which runs down em As for wooden shoes I saw few of em
and for frogs upon my honor I never see a single Frenchman swallow
one which I had been led to beleave was their reglar though beastly
custom One thing which amazed me was the singlar name which they give
to this town of Balong Its divided as every boddy knows into
an upper town sitouate on a mounting and surrounded by a wall or
bullyvar and a lower town which is on the level of the sea Well will
it be believed that they call the upper town the Hot Veal and the other
the Base Veal which is on the contry genrally good in France though
the beaf it must be confest is excrabble

It was in the Base Veal that Deuceace took his lodgian at the Hotel
de Bang in a very crooked street called the Rue del Ascew and if hed
been the Archbishop of Devonshire or the Duke of Canterbury he could
not have given himself greater hairs I can tell you Nothink was too
fine for us now we had a sweet of rooms on the first floor which
belonged to the prime minister of France at least the landlord said
they were the premiers and the Hon Algernon Percy Deuceace who had
not paid his landriss and came to Dover in a coach seamed now to think
that goold was too vulgar for him and a carridge and six would break
down with a man of his weight Shampang flew about like gingerpop
besides bordo clarit burgundy burgong and other wines and all the
delixes of the Balong kitchins We stopped a fortnit at this dull place
and did nothing from morning till night excep walk on the bench and
watch the ships going in and out of arber with one of them long
sliding opraglasses which they call I dont know why tallowscoops
Our amusements for the fortnit we stopped here were boath numerous and
daliteful nothink in fact could be more pickong as they say In the
morning before breakfast we boath walked on the Peer master in a blue
mareen jackit and me in a slapup new livry both provided with long
sliding opraglasses called as I said I dont know Y but I suppose
its a scientafick term tallowscoops With these we igsamined very
attentively the otion the seaweed the pebbles the dead cats the
fishwimmin and the waives like little children playing at leapfrog
which came tumblin over 1 another on to the shoar It seemed to me as if
they were scrambling to get there as well they might being sick of the
sea and anxious for the blessid peaceable terry firmy

After brexfast down we went again that is master on his beat and me
on minefor my place in this foring town was a complete shinycure
and putting our tallyscoops again in our eyes we egsamined a little
more the otion pebbils dead cats and so on and this lasted till
dinner and dinner till bedtime and bedtime lasted till nex day when
came brexfast and dinner and tallyscooping as before This is the
way with all people of this town of which as Ive heard say there is
ten thousand happy English who lead this plesnt life from years end to
years end

Besides this theres billiards and gambling for the gentlemen a little
dancing for the gals and scandle for the dowygers In none of these
amusements did we partake We were a LITTLE too good to play crown pints
at cards and never get paid when we won or to go dangling after the
portionless gals or amuse ourselves with slops and pennywist along
with the old ladies No no my master was a man of fortn now and
behayved himself as sich If ever he condysended to go into the public
room of the Hotel de Bangthe French doubtless for reasons best known
to themselves call this a sallymanjyhe swoar more and lowder than
any one there he abyoused the waiters the wittles the wines With his
glas in his i he staired at every body He took always the place before
the fire He talked about my carridge my currier my servant and
he did wright Ive always found through life that if you wish to be
respected by English people you must be insalent to them especially
if you are a sprig of nobiliaty We LIKE being insulted by noblemenit
shows theyre familiar with us Law bless us Ive known many and many
a genlmn about town whod rather be kicked by a lord than not be noticed
by him theyve even had an aw of ME because I was a lords footman
While my master was hectoring in the parlor at Balong pretious airs
I gave myself in the kitching I can tell you and the consequints was
that we were better served and moar liked than many pipple with twice
our merit

Deuceace had some particklar plans no doubt which kep him so long at
Balong and it clearly was his wish to act the man of fortune there for
a little time before he tried the character of Paris He purchased a
carridge he hired a currier he rigged me in a fine new livry blazin
with lace and he past through the Balong bank a thousand pounds of the
money he had won from Dawkins to his credit at a Paris house showing
the Balong bankers at the same time that hed plenty moar in his
potfolie This was killin two birds with one stone the bankers clerks
spread the nuse over the town and in a day after master had paid the
money every old dowyger in Balong had looked out the Crabs family
podigree in the Peeridge and was quite intimate with the Deuceace name
and estates If Sattn himself were a lord I do beleave theres many
vurtuous English mothers would be glad to have him for a soninlaw

Now though my master had thought fitt to leave town without
excommunicating with his father on the subject of his intended
continental tripe as soon as he was settled at Balong he roat my Lord
Crabbs a letter of which I happen to have a copy It ran thus


BOULOGNE January 25

MY DEAR FATHERI have long in the course of my legal studies found
the necessity of a knowledge of French in which language all the early
history of our profession is written and have determined to take a
little relaxation from chamber reading which has seriously injured
my health If my modest finances can bear a two months journey and a
residence at Paris I propose to remain there that period

Will you have the kindness to send me a letter of introduction to Lord
Bobtail our ambassador My name and your old friendship with him I
know would secure me a reception at his house but a pressing letter
from yourself would at once be more courteous and more effectual

May I also ask you for my last quarters salary I am not an expensive
man my dear father as you know but we are no chameleons and fifty
pounds with my little earnings in my profession would vastly add to
the agremens of my continental excursion

Present my love to all my brothers and sisters Ah how I wish the
hard portion of a younger son had not been mine and that I could live
without the dire necessity for labor happy among the rural scenes of my
childhood and in the society of my dear sisters and you Heaven bless
you dearest father and all those beloved ones now dwelling under the
dear old roof at Sizes

Ever your affectionate son

Algernon

THE RIGHT HON THE EARL OF CRABS c

SIZES COURT BUCKS


To this affeckshnat letter his lordship replied by return of poast as
follos


MY DEAR ALGERNONYour letter came safe to hand and I enclose you the
letter for Lord Bobtail as you desire He is a kind man and has one of
the best cooks in Europe

We were all charmed with your warm remembrances of us not having seen
you for seven years We cannot but be pleased at the family affection
which in spite of time and absence still clings so fondly to home It
is a sad selfish world and very few who have entered it can afford to
keep those fresh feelings which you have my dear son

May you long retain them is a fond fathers earnest prayer Be sure
dear Algernon that they will be through life your greatest comfort as
well as your best worldly ally consoling you in misfortune cheering
you in depression aiding and inspiring you to exertion and success

I am sorry truly sorry that my account at Couttss is so low
just now as to render a payment of your allowance for the present
impossible I see by my book that I owe you now nine quarters or 450L
Depend on it my dear boy that they shall be faithfully paid over to
you on the first opportunity

By the way I have enclosed some extracts from the newspapers which
may interest you and have received a very strange letter from a Mr
Blewitt about a play transaction which I suppose is the case alluded
to in these prints He says you won 4700L from one Dawkins that the
lad paid it that he Blewitt was to go what he calls snacks in the
winning but that you refused to share the booty How can you my dear
boy quarrel with these vulgar people or lay yourself in any way open
to their attacks I have played myself a good deal and there is no man
living who can accuse me of a doubtful act You should either have shot
this Blewitt or paid him Now as the matter stands it is too late to
do the former and perhaps it would be Quixotic to perform the latter
My dearest boy recollect through life that YOU NEVER CAN AFFORD TO BE
DISHONEST WITH A ROQUE Four thousand seven hundred pounds was a great
coup to be sure

As you are now in such high feather can you dearest Algernon lend
me five hundred pounds Upon my soul and honor I will repay you Your
brothers and sisters send you their love I need not add that you have
always the blessings of your affectionate father

CRABS

PSMake it 500 and I will give you my noteofhand for a thousand

      

I neednt say that this did not QUITE enter into Deuceaces eyedears
Lend his father 500 pound indeed Hed as soon have lent him a box on
the year In the fust place he hadn seen old Crabs for seven years as
that nobleman remarked in his epistol in the secknd he hated him and
they hated each other and nex if master had loved his father ever
so much he loved somebody else betterhis fathers son namely and
sooner than deprive that exlent young man of a penny hed have sean all
the fathers in the world hangin at Newgat and all the beloved ones
as he called his sisters the Lady Deuceacisses so many convix at
Bottomy Bay

The newspaper parrografs showed that however secret WE wished to keep
the play transaction the public knew it now full well Blewitt as I
found after was the author of the libels which appeared right and left


GAMBLING IN HIGH LIFEthe HONORABLE Mr Dcce againThis
celebrated whistplayer has turned his accomplishments to some profit
On Friday the 16th January he won five thousand pounds from a VERY
young gentleman Thms Smth Dwkns Esq and lost two thousand five
hundred to R Blwtt Esq of the Tmple Mr D very honorably paid
the sum lost by him to the honorable whistplayer but we have not heard
that BEFORE HIS SUDDEN TRIP TO PARIS Mr Ducce paid HIS losings to
Mr Blwtt


Nex came a Notice to Corryspondents


Fair Play asks us if we know of the gambling doings of the notorious
Deuceace We answer WE DO and in our very next Number propose to
make some of them public

      

They didnt appear however but on the contry the very same
newspeper which had been before so abusiff of Deuceace was now loud in
his praise It said


A paragraph was inadvertently admitted into our paper of last week
most unjustly assailing the character of a gentleman of high birth and
talents the son of the exemplary Erl of Crbs We repel with scorn
and indignation the dastardly falsehoods of the malignant slanderer
who vilified Mr Decece and beg to offer that gentleman the only
reparation in our power for having thus tampered with his unsullied
name We disbelieve the RUFFIAN and HIS STORY and most sincerely
regret that such a tale or SUCH A WRITER should ever have been brought
forward to the readers of this paper


This was satisfactory and no mistake and much pleased we were at the
denial of this conshentious editor So much pleased that master sent
him a tenpound noat and his complymints Hed sent another to the same
address BEFORE this parrowgraff was printed WHY I cant think for I
woodnt suppose any thing musnary in a littery man

Well after this bisniss was concluded the currier hired the carridge
smartened a little and me set up in my new livries we bade ojew to
Bulong in the grandest state posbill What a figure we cut and my i
what a figger the postillion cut A cockhat a jackit made out of a
cows skin it was in cold weather a pigtale about 3 fit in length
and a pair of boots Oh sich a pare A bishop might almost have
preached out of one or a modratsized famly slep in it Me and Mr
Schwigshhnaps the currier sate behind in the rumbill master aloan in
the inside as grand as a Turk and rapt up in his fine fircloak Off
we sett bowing gracefly to the crowd the harnissbells jinglin the
great white hosses snortin kickin and squeelin and the postilium
cracking his wip as loud as if hed been drivin her majesty the quean

      

Well I shant describe our voyitch We passed sefral sitties
willitches and metrappolishes sleeping the fust night at Amiens
witch as everyboddy knows is famous ever since the year 1802 for
whats called the Pease of Amiens We had some very good done with
sugar and brown sos in the Amiens way But after all the boasting about
them I think I like our marrowphats better

Speaking of wedgytables another singler axdent happened here concarning
them Master who was brexfasting before going away told me to go and
get him his fur travlingshoes I went and toald the waiter of the
inn who stared grinned as these chaps always do said Bong which
means very well and presently came back

IM BLEST IF HE DIDNT BRING MASTER A PLATE OF CABBITCH Would you
bleave it that now in the nineteenth sentry when they say
theres schoolmasters abroad these stewpid French jackasses are so
extonishingly ignorant as to call a CABBIDGE a SHOO Never never let
it be said after this that these benighted souperstitious misrabble
SAVIDGES are equill in any respex to the great Brittish people The
moor I travvle the moor I see of the world and other natiums I am
proud of my own and despise and deplore the retchid ignorance of the
rest of Yourup

      

My remarks on Parris you shall have by an early opportunity Me and
Deuceace played some curious pranx there I can tell you




MR DEUCEACE AT PARIS



CHAPTER I


THE TWO BUNDLES OF HAY


LieutenantGeneral Sir George Griffin KCB was about seventyfive
years old when he left this life and the East Ingine army of which he
was a distinguished ornyment Sir Georges first appearance in Injar was
in the character of a cabbingboy to a vessel from which he rose to be
clerk to the owners at Calcutta from which he became all of a sudden a
capting in the Companys service and so rose and rose until he rose to
be a leftenantgeneral when he stopped rising altogetherhopping the
twig of this life as drummers generals dustmen and emperors must do

Sir George did not leave any mal hair to perpetuate the name of Griffin
A widow of about twentyseven and a daughter avaritching twentythree
was left behind to deploar his loss and share his proppaty On old Sir
Georges deth his interesting widdo and orfan who had both been with
him in Injer returned hometried London for a few months did not
like it and resolved on a trip to Paris where very small London people
become very great ones if theyve money as these Griffinses had
The intelligent reader need not be told that Miss Griffin was not the
daughter of Lady Griffin for though marritches are made tolrabbly early
in Injer people are not quite so precoashoos as all that the fact is
Lady G was Sir Georges second wife I need scarcely add that Miss
Matilda Griffin wos the offspring of his fust marritch

Miss Leonora Kicksey a ansum lively Islington gal taken out to
Calcutta and amongst his other goods very comfortably disposed of
by her uncle Capting Kicksey was oneandtwenty when she married Sir
George at seventyone and the 13 Miss Kickseys nine of whom kep a
school at Islington the other 4 being married variously in the city
were not a little envius of my ladys luck and not a little proud of
their relationship to her One of em Miss Jemima Kicksey the oldest
and by no means the least ugly of the sett was staying with her
ladyship and gev me all the partecklars Of the rest of the famly
being of a lo sort I in course no nothink MY acquaintance thank my
stars dont lie among them or the likes of them

Well this Miss Jemima lived with her younger and more fortnat sister
in the qualaty of companion or toddy Poar thing Id a soon be a gally
slave as lead the life she did Every body in the house despised her
her ladyship insulted her the very kitching gals scorned and flouted
her She roat the notes she kep the bills she made the tea she
whipped the chocklate she cleaned the canary birds and gev out the
linning for the wash She was my ladys walking pocket or rettycule
and fetched and carried her handkercher or her smellbottle like a
wellbred spaniel All night at her ladyships swarries she thumped
kidrills nobody ever thought of asking HER to dance when Miss
Griffing sung she played the piano and was scolded because the singer
was out of tune abommanating dogs she never drove out without her
ladyships puddle in her lap and reglarly unwell in a carriage she
never got anything but the back seat Poar Jemima I can see her now
in my ladys SECKNDBEST old clothes the ladiesmaids always got the
prime leavings a liloc sattn gown crumpled blotched and greasy a
pair of white sattn shoes of the color of Inger rubber a faded yellow
velvet hat with a wreath of hartifishl flowers run to sead and a bird
of Parrowdice perched on the top of it melumcolly and moulting with
only a couple of feathers left in his unfortunate tail

Besides this ornyment to their saloon Lady and Miss Griffin kept a
number of other servants in the kitching 2 ladiesmaids 2 footmin
six feet high each crimson coats goold knots and white cassymear
pantyloons a coachmin to match a page and a Shassure a kind
of servant only known among forriners and who looks more like a
majorgeneral than any other mortial wearing a cockhat a unicorn
covered with silver lace mustashos eplets and a sword by his side
All these to wait upon two ladies not counting a host of the fair sex
such as cooks scullion housekeepers and so forth

My Lady Griffins lodging was at forty pound a week in a grand sweet
of rooms in the Plas Vandome at Paris And having thus described their
house and their servants hall I may give a few words of description
concerning the ladies themselves

In the fust place and in coarse they hated each other My lady was
twentysevena widdo of two yearsfat fair and rosy A slow quiet
coldlooking woman as those fairhaired gals generally are it seemed
difficult to rouse her either into likes or dislikes to the former
at least She never loved any body but ONE and that was herself She
hated in her calm quiet way almost every one else who came near
herevery one from her neighbor the duke who had slighted her at
dinner down to John the footman who had torn a hole in her train I
think this womans heart was like one of them lithograffic stones you
CANT RUB OUT ANY THING when once its drawn or wrote on it nor could
you out of her ladyships stoneheart I meanin the shape of an
affront a slight or real or phansied injury She boar an exlent
irreprotchable character against which the tongue of scandal never
wagged She was allowed to be the best wife posbilland so she was but
she killed her old husband in two years as dead as ever Mr Thurtell
killed Mr William Weare She never got into a passion not sheshe
never said a rude word but shed a geniusa genius which many women
haveof making A HELL of a house and tortring the poor creatures of
her family until they were wellnigh drove mad

Miss Matilda Griffin was a good deal uglier and about as amiable as
her motherinlaw She was crooked and squinted my lady to do her
justice was straight and looked the same way with her is She was
dark and my lady was fairsentimental as her ladyship was cold My
lady was never in a passionMiss Matilda always and awfille were the
scenes which used to pass between these 2 women and the wickid wickid
quarls which took place Why did they live together There was the
mistry Not related and hating each other like pison it would surely
have been easier to remain seprat and so have detested each other at a
distans

As for the fortune which old Sir George had left that it was clear
was very considrabble300 thousand lb at the least as I have heard
say But nobody knew how it was disposed of Some said that her ladyship
was sole mistriss of it others that it was divided others that she had
only a life inkum and that the money was all to go as was natral to
Miss Matilda These are subjix which are not praps very interesting to
the British public but were mighty important to my master the
Honrable Algernon Percy Deuceace esquire barristeratlaw etsettler
etsettler

For Ive forgot to inform you that my master was very intimat in this
house and that we were now comfortably settled at the Hotel Mirabew
pronounced Marobo in French in the Rew delly Pay at Paris We had
our cab and two riding horses our bankers book and a thousand pound
for a balantz at Lafitts our club at the corner of the Rew Gramong
our share in a box at the oppras our apartments spacious and elygant
our swarries at court our dinners at his excellency Lord Bobtails
and elsewhere Thanks to poar Dawkinss five thousand pound we were as
complete gentlemen as any in Paris

Now my master like a wise man as he was seaing himself at the head of
a smart sum of money and in a country where his debts could not bother
him determined to give up for the present every think like gamblingat
least high play as for losing or winning a ralow of Napoleums at whist
or ecarty it did not matter it looks like money to do such things and
gives a kind of respectabilaty But as for play he wouldntoh no
not for worldsdo such a thing He HAD played like other young men
of fashn and won and lost old fox he didnt say he had PAID but he
had given up the amusement and was now determined he said to live
on his inkum The fact is my master was doing his very best to act
the respectable man and a very good game it is too but it requires a
precious great roag to play it

He made his appearans reglar at churchme carrying a handsome large
black marocky Prayerbook and Bible with the psalms and lessons marked
out with red ribbings and youd have thought as I graivly laid the
volloms down before him and as he berried his head in his nicely
brushed hat before service began that such a pious proper morl young
nobleman was not to be found in the whole of the peeridge It was a
comfort to look at him Efry old tabby and dowyger at my Lord Bobtails
turned up the wights of their is when they spoke of him and vowed they
had never seen such a dear daliteful exlent young man What a good son
he must be they said and oh what a good soninlaw He had the pick
of all the English gals at Paris before we had been there 3 months But
unfortunately most of them were poar and love and a cottidge was not
quite in masters way of thinking

Well about this time my Lady Griffin and Miss G made their appearants
at Parris and master who was up to snough very soon changed his noat
He sate near them at chapple and sung hims with my lady he danced with
em at the embassy balls he road with them in the Boy de Balong and
the Shandeleasies which is the French High Park he roat potry in Miss
Griffins halbim and sang jewets along with her and Lady Griffin he
brought sweetmeats for the puddledog he gave money to the footmin
kissis and gloves to the sniggering ladiesmaids he was sivvle even
to poar Miss Kicksey there wasnt a single soal at the Griffinses that
didnt adoar this good young man

The ladies if they hated befoar you may be sure detested each other
now wuss than ever There had been always a jallowsy between them
miss jellows of her motherinlaws bewty madam of misss espree miss
taunting my lady about the school at Islington and my lady sneering at
miss for her squint and her crookid back And now came a stronger caws
They both fell in love with Mr Deuceacemy lady that is to say as
much as she could with her cold selfish temper She liked Deuceace who
amused her and made her laff She liked his manners his riding and his
good loox and being a pervinew herself had a dubble respect for real
aristocratick flesh and blood Misss love on the contry was all flams
and fury Shed always been at this work from the time she had been at
school where she very nigh run away with a Frentch master next with
a footman which I may say in confidence is by no means unnatral or
unusyouall as I COULD SHOW IF I LIKED and so had been going on sins
fifteen She reglarly flung herself at Deuceaces headsuch sighing
crying and ogling I never see Often was I ready to bust out laffin
as I brought master skoars of rosecolored billydoos folded up like
cockhats and smellin like barbers shops which this very tender young
lady used to address to him Now though master was a scoundrill and no
mistake he was a gentlemin and a man of good breading and miss CAME
A LITTLE TOO STRONG pardon the wulgarity of the xpression with her
hardor and attachmint for one of his taste Besides she had a crookid
spine and a squint so that supposing their fortns tolrabbly equal
Deuceace reely preferred the motherinlaw

Now then it was his bisniss to find out which had the most money With
an English famly this would have been easy a look at a will at Doctor
Commonses would settle the matter at once But this India naybobs
will was at Calcutty or some outlandish place and there was no getting
sight of a coppy of it I will do Mr Algernon Deuceace the justass to
say that he was so little musnary in his love for Lady Griffin that he
would have married her gladly even if she had ten thousand pounds less
than Miss Matilda In the meantime his plan was to keep em both in
play until he could strike the best fish of the twonot a difficult
matter for a man of his genus besides Miss was hooked for certain



CHAPTER II

HONOR THY FATHER


I said that my master was adoard by every person in my Lady Griffins
establishmint I should have said by every person excep onea young
French gnlmn that is who before our appearants had been mighty
partiklar with my lady ockupying by her side exackly the same
pasition which the Honrable Mr Deuceace now held It was bewtiffle
and headifying to see how coolly that young nobleman kicked the poar
Shevalliay de LOrge out of his shoes and how gracefully he himself
stept into em Munseer de LOrge was a smart young French jentleman
of about my masters age and good looks but not possest of half my
masters impidince Not that that quallaty is uncommon in France
but few very few had it to such a degree as my exlent employer Mr
Deuceace Besides De LOrge was reglarly and reely in love with Lady
Griffin and master only pretending he had of coars an advantitch
which the poor Frentchman never could git He was all smiles and gaty
while Delorge was ockward and melumcolly My master had said twenty
pretty things to Lady Griffin befor the shevalier had finished
smoothing his hat staring at her and sighing fit to bust his weskit
O luv luv THIS isnt the way to win a woman or my names not Fitzroy
Yellowplush Myself when I begun my carear among the fair six I
was always sighing and moping like this poar Frenchman What was the
consquints The foar fust women I adoared lafft at me and left me for
something more lively With the rest I have edopted a diffrent game
and with tolerable suxess I can tell you But this is eggatism which I
aboar

Well the long and the short of it is that Munseer Ferdinand Hyppolite
Xavier Stanislas Shevalier de LOrge was reglar cut out by Munseer
Algernon Percy Deuceace Exquire Poar Ferdinand did not leave the
househe hadnt the heart to do thatnor had my lady the desire
to dismiss him He was usefle in a thousand different ways gitting
oppraboxes and invitations to French swarries bying gloves and O de
Colong writing French noats and such like Always let me recommend
an English famly going to Paris to have at least one young man of the
sort about them Never mind how old your ladyship is he will make love
to you never mind what errints you send him upon hell trot off and do
them Besides hes always quite and welldresst and never drinx moar
than a pint of wine at dinner which as I say is a pint to consider
Such a conveniants of a man was Munseer de LOrgethe greatest use
and comfort to my lady posbill if it was but to laff at his bad
pronunciatium of English it was somethink amusink the fun was to pit
him against poar Miss Kicksey she speakin French and he our naytif
British tong

My master to do him justace was perfickly sivvle to this poar young
Frenchman and having kicked him out of the place which he occupied
sertingly treated his fallen anymy with every respect and consideration
Poar modist downhearted little Ferdinand adoured my lady as a goddice
and so he was very polite likewise to my masternever venturing once to
be jellows of him or to question my Lady Griffins right to change her
lover if she choase to do so

Thus then matters stood master had two strinx to his bo and might
take either the widdo or the orfn as he preferred com bong lwee
somblay as the Frentch say His only pint was to discover how the money
was disposed off which evidently belonged to one or other or boath
At any rate he was sure of one as sure as any mortal man can be in this
sublimary spear where nothink is suttin except unsertnty

      

A very unixpected insident here took place which in a good deal changed
my masters calkylations

One night after conducting the two ladies to the oppra after suppink
of white soop sammydeperdrow and shampang glassy which means eyced
at their house in the Plas Vandom me and master droav hoam in the cab
as happy as possbill

Chawls you dd scoundrel says he to me for he was in an exlent
humer when Im married Ill dubbil your wagis

This he might do to be sure without injuring himself seeing that he
had us yet never paid me any But what then Law bless us things
would be at a pretty pass if we suvvants only lived on our WAGIS our
puckwisits is the thing and no mistake

I ixprest my gratitude as best I could swoar that it wasnt for wagis
I served himthat I would as leaf weight upon him for nothink and that
never never so long as I livd would I of my own accord part from
such an exlent master By the time these two spitches had been mademy
spitch and hiswe arrived at the Hotel Mirabeu which us every body
knows aint very distant from the Plas Vandome Up we marched to our
apartmince me carrying the light and the cloax master hummink a hair
out of the oppra as merry as a lark

I opened the door of our salong There was lights already in the room
an empty shampang bottle roalin on the floar another on the table near
which the sofy was drawn and on it lay a stout old genlmn smoaking
seagars as if hed bean in an inn taproom

Deuceace who abommunates seagars as Ive already shown bust into
a furious raige against the genlmn whom he could hardly see for the
smoak and with a number of oaves quite unnecessary to repeat asked
him what bisniss hed there

The smoaking chap rose and laying down his seagar began a ror of
laffin and said What Algy my boy dont you know me

The reader may praps recklect a very affecting letter which was
published in the last chapter of these memoars in which the writer
requested a loan of five hundred pound from Mr Algernon Deuceace and
which boar the respected signatur of the Earl of Crabs Mr Deuceaces
own father It was that distinguished arastycrat who was now smokin and
laffin in our room

My Lord Crabs was as I preshumed about 60 years old A stowt burly
redfaced baldheaded nobleman whose nose seemed blushing at what his
mouth was continually swallowing whose hand praps trembled a little
and whose thy and legg was not quite so full or as steddy as they
had been in former days But he was a respecktabble finelooking old
nobleman and though it must be confest 12 drunk when we fust made our
appearance in the salong yet by no means moor so than a reel noblemin
ought to be

What Algy my boy shouts out his lordship advancing and seasing
master by the hand doant you know your own father

Master seemed anythink but overhappy My lord says he looking very
pail and speakin rayther slow I didntI confessthe unexpected
pleasureof seeing you in Paris The fact is sir said he recovering
himself a little the fact is there was such a confounded smoke of
tobacco in the room that I really could not see who the stranger was
who had paid me such an unexpected visit

A bad habit Algernon a bad habit said my lord lighting another
seagar a disgusting and filthy practice which you my dear child
will do well to avoid It is at best dear Algernon but a nasty idle
pastime unfitting a man as well for mental exertion as for respectable
society sacrificing at once the vigor of the intellect and the graces
of the person Bytheby what infernal bad tobacco they have too in
this hotel Could not you send your servant to get me a few seagars at
the Cafe de Paris Give him a fivefranc piece and let him go at once
thats a good fellow

Here his lordship hiccupt and drank off a fresh tumbler of shampang
Very sulkily master drew out the coin and sent me on the errint

Knowing the Cafe de Paris to be shut at that hour I didnt say a word
but quietly establisht myself in the anteroom where as it happened
by a singler coinstdints I could hear every word of the conversation
between this exlent pair of relatifs

Help yourself and get another bottle says my lord after a sollum
paws My poar master the king of all other compnies in which he moved
seamed here but to play secknd fiddill and went to the cubbard
from which his father had already igstracted two bottils of his prime
Sillary

He put it down before his father coft spit opened the windows
stirred the fire yawned clapt his hand to his forehead and suttnly
seamed as uneezy as a genlmn could be But it was of no use the old
one would not budg Help yourself says he again and pass me the
bottil

You are very good father says master but really I neither drink
nor smoke

Right my boy quite right Talk about a good conscience in this
lifea good STOMACK is everythink No bad nights no headachseh
Quite cool and collected for your law studies in the morningeh And
the old nobleman here grinned in a manner which would have done creddit
to Mr Grimoldi

Master sate pale and wincing as Ive seen a pore soldier under the cat
He didnt anser a word His exlent pa went on warming as he continued
to speak and drinking a fresh glas at evry full stop

How you must improve with such talents and such principles Why
Algernon all London talks of your industry and perseverance youre not
merely a philosopher man hang it youve got the philosophers stone
Fine rooms fine horses champagne and all for 200 a year

I presume sir says my master that you mean the two hundred a year
which YOU pay me

The very sum my boy the very sum cries my lord laffin as if he
would die Why thats the wonder I never pay the two hundred a year
and you keep all this state up upon nothing Give me your secret O you
young Trismegistus Tell your old father how such wonders can be worked
and I willyes then upon my word I willpay you your two hundred a
year

Enfin my lord says Mr Deuceace starting up and losing all
patience will you have the goodness to tell me what this visit means
You leave me to starve for all you care and you grow mighty facetious
because I earn my bread You find me in prosperity and

Precisely my boy precisely Keep your temper and pass that bottle
I find you in prosperity and a young gentleman of your genius and
acquirements asks me why I seek your society Oh Algernon Algernon
this is not worthy of such a profound philosopher WHY do I seek you
Why because you ARE in prosperity O my son else why the devil should
I bother my self about you Did I your poor mother or your family
ever get from you a single affectionate feeling Did we or any other of
your friends or intimates ever know you to be guilty of a single honest
or generous action Did we ever pretend any love for you or you for us
Algernon Deuceace you dont want a father to tell you that you are
a swindler and a spendthrift I have paid thousands for the debts of
yourself and your brothers and if you pay nobody else I am determined
you shall repay me You would not do it by fair means when I wrote
to you and asked you for a loan of money I knew you would not Had
I written again to warn you of my coming you would have given me the
slip and so I came uninvited to FORCE you to repay me THATS why I
am here Mr Algernon and so help yourself and pass the bottle

After this speach the old genlmn sunk down on the sofa and puffed
as much smoke out of his mouth as if hed been the chimley of a
steaminjian I was pleased I confess with the sean and liked to see
this venrabble and virtuous old man anocking his son about the hed
just as Deuceace had done with Mr Richard Blewitt as Ive before
shown Masters face was fust redhot next chawkwhite and then
skyblew He looked for all the world like Mr Tippy Cooke in the
tragady of Frankinstang At last he mannidged to speek

My lord says he I expected when I saw you that some such scheme was
on foot Swindler and spendthrift as I am at least it is but a family
failing and I am indebted for my virtues to my fathers precious
example Your lordship has I perceive added drunkenness to the list
of your accomplishments and I suppose under the influence of that
gentlemanly excitement has come to make these preposterous propositions
to me When you are sober you will perhaps be wise enough to know
that fool as I may be I am not such a fool as you think me and that
if I have got money I intend to keep itevery farthing of it though
you were to be ten times as drunk and ten times as threatening as you
are now

Well well my boy said Lord Crabs who seemed to have been half
asleep during his sons oratium and received all his sneers and
surcasms with the most complete goodhumor well well if you will
resist tant pis pour toi Ive no desire to ruin you recollect and
am not in the slightest degree angry but I must and will have a thousand
pounds You had better give me the money at once it will cost you more
if you dont

Sir says Mr Deuceace I will be equally candid I would not give
you a farthing to save you from

Here I thought proper to open the doar and touching my hat said I
have been to the Cafe de Paris my lord but the house is shut

Bon theres a good lad you may keep the five francs And now get me
a candle and show me down stairs

But my master seized the wax taper Pardon me my lord says he
What a servant do it when your son is in the room Ah par exemple
my dear father said he laughing you think there is no politeness
left among us And he led the way out

Good night my dear boy said Lord Crabs

God bless you sir says he Are you wrapped warm Mind the step

And so this affeckshnate pair parted



CHAPTER III

MINEWVRING


Master rose the nex morning with a dismal countinantshe seamed to
think that his pas visit boded him no good I heard him muttering at
his brexfast and fumbling among his hundred pound notes once he had
laid a parsle of them aside I knew what he meant to send em to his
father But no says he at last clutching them all up together again
and throwing them into his escritaw what harm can he do me If he is
a knave I know another whos full as sharp Lets see if we cannot beat
him at his own weapons With that Mr Deuceace drest himself in his
best clothes and marched off to the Plas Vandom to pay his cort to the
fair widdo and the intresting orfn

It was abowt ten oclock and he propoased to the ladies on seeing
them a number of planns for the days rackryation Riding in the Body
Balong going to the Twillaries to see King Looy Disweet who was then
the raining sufferin of the French crownd go to chapple and finely
a dinner at 5 oclock at the Caffy de Parry whents they were all to
adjourn to see a new peace at the theatre of the Pot St Martin called
Sussannar and the Elders

The gals agread to everythink exsep the two last prepositiums We have
an engagement my dear Mr Algernon said my lady Looka very kind
letter from Lady Bobtail And she handed over a pafewmd noat from that
exolted lady It ran thus


FBG ST HONORE Thursday Feb 15 1817

MY DEAR LADY GRIFFINIt is an age since we met Harassing public
duties occupy so much myself and Lord Bobtail that we have scarce time
to see our private friends among whom I hope my dear Lady Griffin
will allow me to rank her Will you excuse so unceremonious an
invitation and dine with us at the embassy today We shall be en
petite comite and shall have the pleasure of hearing I hope some of
your charming daughters singing in the evening I ought perhaps to
have addressed a separate note to dear Miss Griffin but I hope she
will pardon a poor diplomate who has so many letters to write you
know

Farewell till seven when I POSITIVELY MUST see you both Ever dearest
Lady Griffin your affectionate

ELIZA BOBTAIL


Such a letter from the ambassdriss brot by the ambasdors Shassure and
sealed with his seal of arms would affect anybody in the middling ranx
of life It droav Lady Griffin mad with delight and long before my
masters arrivle shed sent Mortimer and Fitzclarence her two footmin
along with a polite reply in the affummatiff

Master read the noat with no such fealinx of joy He felt that there
was somethink agoing on behind the seans and though he could not tell
how was sure that some danger was near him That old fox of a father of
his had begun his MInations pretty early

Deuceace handed back the letter sneared and poohd and hinted that
such an invitation was an insult at best what he called a pees ally
and the ladies might depend upon it was only sent because Lady Bobtail
wanted to fill up two spare places at her table But Lady Griffin and
Miss would not have his insinwations they knew too fu lords ever to
refuse an invitatium from any one of them Go they would and poor
Deuceace must dine alone After they had been on their ride and had had
their other amusemince master came back with them chatted and laft
he was mighty sarkastix with my lady tender and sentrymentle with Miss
and left them both in high sperrits to perform their twollet before
dinner

As I came to the door for I was as famillyer as a servnt of the house
as I came into the drawingroom to announts his cab I saw master very
quietly taking his pocketbook or pot fool as the French call it and
thrusting it under one of the cushinx of the sofa What game is this
thinx I

Why this was the game In abowt two hours when he knew the ladies were
gon he pretends to be vastly anxious abowt the loss of his potfolio
and back he goes to Lady Griffinses to seek for it there

Pray says he on going in ask Miss Kicksey if I may see her for a
single moment And down comes Miss Kicksey quite smiling and happy to
see him

Law Mr Deuceace says she trying to blush as hard as ever she
could you quite surprise me I dont know whether I ought really
being alone to admit a gentleman

Nay dont say so dear Miss Kicksey for do you know I came here for
a double purposeto ask about a pocketbook which I have lost and may
perhaps have left here and then to ask you if you will have the great
goodness to pity a solitary bachelor and give him a cup of your nice
tea

NICE TEA I thot I should have split for Im blest if master had eaten
a morsle of dinner

Never mind down to tea they sat Do you take cream and sugar dear
sir says poar Kicksey with a voice as tender as a tuttleduff

Both dearest Miss Kicksey answers master who stowed in a power of
sashong and muffinx which would have done honor to a washawoman

I shant describe the conversation that took place betwigst master and
this young lady The reader praps knows y Deuceace took the trouble to
talk to her for an hour and to swallow all her tea He wanted to find
out from her all she knew about the famly money matters and settle at
once which of the two Griffinses he should marry

The poar thing of cors was no match for such a man as my master In
a quarter of an hour he had if I may use the igspression turned her
inside out He knew everything that she knew and that poar creature
was very little There was nine thousand a year she had heard say
in money in houses in banks in Injar and what not Boath the ladies
signed papers for selling or buying and the money seemed equilly
divided betwigst them

NINE THOUSAND A YEAR Deuceace went away his cheex tingling his heart
beating He without a penny could nex morning if he liked be master
of five thousand per hannum

Yes But how Which had the money the mother or the daughter All the
teadrinking had not taught him this piece of nollidge and Deuceace
thought it a pity that he could not marry both

      

The ladies came back at night mightaly pleased with their reception at
the ambasdors and stepping out of their carridge bid coachmin drive
on with a gentlemin who had handed them outa stout old gentlemin who
shook hands most tenderly at parting and promised to call often upon my
Lady Griffin He was so polite that he wanted to mount the stairs with
her ladyship but no she would not suffer it Edward says she to
the coachmin quite loud and pleased that all the people in the hotel
should hear her you will take the carriage and drive HIS LORDSHIP
home Now can you guess who his lordship was The Right Hon the
Earl of Crabs to be sure the very old genlmn whom I had seen on such
charming terms with his son the day before Master knew this the nex
day and began to think he had been a fool to deny his pa the thousand
pound

Now though the suckmstansies of the dinner at the ambasdors only came
to my years some time after I may as well relate em here word for
word as they was told me by the very genlmn who waited behind Lord
Crabseses chair

There was only a petty comity at dinner as Lady Bobtail said and my
Lord Crabs was placed betwigst the two Griffinses being mighty ellygant
and palite to both Allow me says he to Lady G between the soop and
the fish my dear madam to thank youfervently thank you for your
goodness to my poor boy Your ladyship is too young to experience but
I am sure far too tender not to understand the gratitude which must
fill a fond parents heart for kindness shown to his child Believe
me says my lord looking her full and tenderly in the face that the
favors you have done to another have been done equally to myself and
awaken in my bosom the same grateful and affectionate feelings with
which you have already inspired my son Algernon

Lady Griffin blusht and droopt her head till her ringlets fell into her
fishplate and she swallowed Lord Crabss flumry just as she would so
many musharuins My lord whose powers of slackjaw was notoarious nex
addrast another spitch to Miss Griffin He said hed heard how Deuceace
was SITUATED Miss blushtwhat a happy dog he wasMiss blusht crimson
and then he sighed deeply and began eating his turbat and lobster
sos Master was a good un at flumry but law bless you he was no moar
equill to the old man than a molehill is to a mounting Before the
night was over he had made as much progress as another man would in a
ear One almost forgot his red nose and his big stomick and his wicked
leering is in his gentle insiniwating woice his fund of annygoats
and above all the bewtific morl religious and honrabble toan of his
genral conservation Praps you will say that these ladies were for such
rich pipple mightaly esaly captivated but recklect my dear sir that
they were fresh from Injarthat theyd not sean many lordsthat
they adoared the peeridge as every honest woman does in England who has
proper feelinx and has read the fashnabble novvlesand that here at
Paris was their fust step into fashnabble sosiaty

Well after dinner while Miss Matilda was singing Die tantie or Dip
your chair or some of them sellabrated Italyian hairs when she began
this squall hang me if shed ever stop my lord gets hold of Lady
Griffin again and gradgaly begins to talk to her in a very different
strane

What a blessing it is for us all says he that Algernon has found a
friend so respectable as your ladyship

Indeed my lord and why I suppose I am not the only respectable
friend that Mr Deuceace has

No surely not the only one he HAS HAD his birth and permit me to
say his relationship to myself have procured him many But here my
lord heaved a very affecting and large sigh

But what says my lady laffing at the igspression of his dismal face
You dont mean that Mr Deuceace has lost them or is unworthy of them

I trust not my dear madam I trust not but he is wild thoughtless
extravagant and embarrassed and you know a man under these
circumstances is not very particular as to his associates

Embarrassed Good heavens He says he has two thousand a year left him
by a godmother and he does not seem even to spend his incomea very
handsome independence too for a bachelor

My lord nodded his head sadly and saidWill your ladyship give me
your word of honor to be secret My son has but a thousand a year which
I allow him and is heavily in debt He has played madam I fear
and for this reason I am so glad to hear that he is in a respectable
domestic circle where he may learn in the presence of far greater and
purer attractions to forget the dicebox and the low company which has
been his bane

My Lady Griffin looked very grave indeed Was it true Was Deuceace
sincere in his professions of love or was he only a sharper wooing her
for her money Could she doubt her informer his own father and whats
more a real flesh and blood pear of parlyment She determined she would
try him Praps she did not know she had liked Deuceace so much until
she kem to feel how much she should HATE him if she found hed been
playing her false

The evening was over and back they came as weeve seenmy lord
driving home in my ladys carridge her ladyship and Miss walking up
stairs to their own apartmince

Here for a wonder was poar Miss Kicksey quite happy and smiling and
evidently full of a secretsomething mighty pleasant to judge from
her loox She did not long keep it As she was making tea for the ladies
for in that house they took a cup regular before bedtime Well my
lady says she who do you think has been to drink tea with me Poar
thing a frendly face was a event in her lifea teaparty quite a hera

Why perhaps Lenoir my maid says my lady looking grave I wish
Miss Kicksey you would not demean yourself by mixing with my domestics
Recollect madam that you are sister to Lady Griffin

No my lady it was not Lenoir it was a gentleman and a handsome
gentleman too

Oh it was Monsieur de lOrge then says Miss he promised to bring
me some guitarstrings

No nor yet M de lOrge He came but was not so polite as to ask
for me What do you think of your own beau the Honorable Mr Algernon
Deuceace and so saying poar Kicksey clapped her hands together and
looked as joyfle as if shed come in to a fortin

Mr Deuceace here and why pray says my lady who recklected all
that his exlent pa had been saying to her

Why in the first place he had left his pocketbook and in the
second he wanted he said a dish of my nice tea which he took and
stayed with me an hour or moar

And pray Miss Kicksey said Miss Matilda quite contempshusly what
may have been the subject of your conversation with Mr Algernon Did
you talk politics or music or fine arts or metaphysics Miss M
being what was called a blue as most humpbacked women in sosiaty are
always made a pint to speak on these grand subjects

No indeed he talked of no such awful matters If he had you know
Matilda I should never have understood him First we talked about the
weather next about muffins and crumpets Crumpets he said he liked
best and then we talked here Miss Kickseys voice fell about poor
dear Sir George in heaven what a good husband he was and

What a good fortune he left eh Miss Kicksey says my lady with a
hard snearing voice and a diabollicle grin

Yes dear Leonora he spoke so respectfully of your blessed husband
and seemed so anxious about you and Matilda it was quite charming to
hear him dear man

And pray Miss Kicksey what did you tell him

Oh I told him that you and Leonora had nine thousand a year and

What then

Why nothing that is all I know I am sure I wish I had ninety says
poor Kicksey her eyes turning to heaven

Ninety fiddlesticks Did not Mr Deuceace ask how the money was left
and to which of us

Yes but I could not tell him

I knew it says my lady slapping down her teacupI knew it

Well says Miss Matilda and why not Lady Griffin There is no
reason you should break your teacup because Algernon asks a harmless
question HE is not mercenary he is all candor innocence generosity
He is himself blessed with a sufficient portion of the worlds goods to
be content and often and often has he told me he hoped the woman of his
choice might come to him without a penny that he might show the purity
of his affection

Ive no doubt says my lady Perhaps the lady of his choice is Miss
Matilda Griffin and she flung out of the room slamming the door and
leaving Miss Matilda to bust into tears as was her reglar custom and
pour her loves and woas into the buzzom of Miss Kicksey



CHAPTER IV

HITTING THE NALE ON THE HEDD


The nex morning down came me and master to Lady GriffinsesI amusing
myself with the gals in the antyroom he paying his devours to the
ladies in the salong Miss was thrumming on her gitter my lady was
before a great box of papers busy with accounts bankers books
lawyers letters and what not Law bless us its a kind of bisniss I
should like well enuff especially when my hannual account was seven or
eight thousand on the right side like my ladys My lady in this house
kep all these matters to herself Miss was a vast deal too sentrimentle
to mind business

Miss Matildas eyes sparkled as master came in she pinted gracefully to
a place on the sofy beside her which Deuceace took My lady only looked
up for a moment smiled very kindly and down went her head among the
papers agen as busy as a B

Lady Griffin has had letters from London says Miss from nasty
lawyers and people Come here and sit by me you naughty man you

And down sat master Willingly says he my dear Miss Griffin why I
declare it is quits a teteatete

Well says Miss after the prillimnary flumries in coarse we met a
friend of yours at the embassy Mr Deuceace

My father doubtless he is a great friend of the ambassador and
surprised me myself by a visit the night before last

What a dear delightful old man how he loves you Mr Deuceace

Oh amazingly says master throwing his is to heaven

He spoke of nothing but you and such praises of you

Master breathed more freely He is very good my dear father but
blind as all fathers are he is so partial and attached to me

He spoke of you being his favorite child and regretted that you were
not his eldest son I can but leave him the small portion of a younger
brother he said but never mind he has talents a noble name and an
independence of his own

An independence yes oh yes I am quite independent of my father

Two thousand pounds a year left you by your godmother the very same
you told us you know

Neither more nor less says master bobbing his head a sufficiency
my dear Miss Griffinto a man of my moderate habits an ample
provision

Bytheby cries out Lady Griffin interrupting the conversation you
who are talking about money matters there I wish you would come to the
aid of poor ME Come naughty boy and help me out with this long long
sum

DIDNT HE GOthats all My i how his is shone as he skipt across
the room and seated himself by my lady

Look said she my agents write me over that they have received a
remittance of 7200 rupees at 2s 9d a rupee Do tell me what the sum
is in pounds and shillings which master did with great gravity

Nine hundred and ninety pounds Good I daresay you are right Im sure
I cant go through the fatigue to see And now comes another question
Whose money is this mine or Matildas You see it is the interest of a
sum in India which we have not had occasion to touch and according to
the terms of poor Sir Georges will I really dont know how to dispose
of the money except to spend it Matilda what shall we do with it

La maam I wish you would arrange the business yourself

Well then Algernon YOU tell me and she laid her hand on his and
looked him most pathetickly in the face

Why says he I dont know how Sir George left his money you must
let me see his will first

Oh willingly

Masters chair seemed suddenly to have got springs in the cushns he was
obliged to HOLD HIMSELF DOWN

Look here I have only a copy taken by my hand from Sir Georges own
manuscript Soldiers you know do not employ lawyers much and this
was written on the night before going into action And she read I
George Griffin c cyou know how these things beginbeing now of
sane mindum um umleave to my friends Thomas Abraham Hicks
a colonel in the H E I Companys Service and to John Monro
Mackirkincroft of the house of Huffle Mackirkincroft and Dobbs at
Calcutta the whole of my property to be realized as speedily as they
may consistently with the interests of the property in trust for
my wife Leonora Emilia Griffin born L E Kicksey and my only
legitimate child Matilda Griffin The interest resulting from such
property to be paid to them share and share alike the principal
to remain untouched in the names of the said T A Hicks and J M
Mackirkincroft until the death of my wife Leonora Emilia Griffin when
it shall be paid to my daughter Matilda Griffin her heirs executors
or assigns

There said my lady we wont read any more all the rest is stuff
But now you know the whole business tell us what is to be done with the
money

Why the money unquestionably should be divided between you

Tant mieux say I I really thought it had been all Matildas

      

There was a paws for a minit or two after the will had been read Master
left the desk at which he had been seated with her ladyship paced up
and down the room for a while and then came round to the place where
Miss Matilda was seated At last he said in a low trembling voice

I am almost sorry my dear Lady Griffin that you have read that will
to me for an attachment such as mine must seem I fear mercenary
when the object of it is so greatly favored by worldly fortune Miss
GriffinMatilda I know I may say the word your dear eyes grant me the
permission I need not tell you or you dear motherinlaw how long
how fondly I have adored you My tender my beautiful Matilda I will
not affect to say I have not read your heart ere this and that I have
not known the preference with which you have honored me SPEAK IT
dear girl from your own sweet lips in the presence of an affectionate
parent utter the sentence which is to seal my happiness for life
Matilda dearest Matilda say oh say that you love me

Miss M shivered turned pail rowled her eyes about and fell on
masters neck whispering hodibly I DO

My lady looked at the pair for a moment with her teeth grinding her is
glaring her busm throbbing and her face chock white for all the world
like Madam Pasty in the oppra of Mydear when shes goin to mudder
her childring you recklect and out she flounced from the room
without a word knocking down poar me who happened to be very near the
dor and leaving my master along with his crookback mistress

Ive repotted the speech he made to her pretty well The fact is I got
it in a ruff copy only on the copy its wrote Lady Griffin Leonora
instead of Miss Griffin Matilda as in the abuff and so on

Master had hit the right nail on the head this time he thought but his
adventors ant over yet



CHAPTER V

THE GRIFFINS CLAWS


Well master had hit the right nail on the head this time thanx to
luckthe crooked one to be sure but then it had the GOOLD NOBB which
was the part Deuceace most valued as well he should being a connyshure
as to the relletiff valyou of pretious metals and much preferring
virging goold like this to poor old battered iron like my Lady Griffin

And so in spite of his father at which old noblemin Mr Deuceace now
snapt his fingers in spite of his detts which to do him Justas had
never stood much in his way and in spite of his povatty idleness
extravagans swindling and debotcheries of all kinds which ant
GENERALLY very favorable to a young man who has to make his way in the
world in spite of all there he was I say at the topp of the trea
the fewcher master of a perfect fortun the defianced husband of a
fool of a wife What can mortial man want more Vishns of ambishn now
occupied his soal Shooting boxes oppra boxes money boxes always full
hunters at Melton a seat in the house of Commins heaven knows what
and not a poar footman who only describes what hes seen and cant in
cors pennytrate into the idears and the busms of men

You may be shore that the threecornered noats came pretty thick now
from the Griffinses Miss was always awriting them befoar and now
nite noon and mornink breakfast dinner and sopper in they came
till my pantry for master never read em and I carried em out was
puffickly intolrabble from the odor of musk ambygrease bargymot and
other sense with which they were impregniated Heres the contense
of three on em which Ive kep in my dex these twenty years as
skeewriosities Faw I can smel em at this very minit as I am copying
them down


BILLY DOO No I

Monday morning 2 oclock

Tis the witching hour of night Luna illumines my chamber and falls
upon my sleepless pillow By her light I am inditing these words to
thee my Algernon My brave and beautiful my souls lord when shall
the time come when the tedious night shall not separate us nor the
blessed day Twelve one two I have heard the bells chime and the
quarters and never cease to think of my husband My adored Percy
pardon the girlish confessionI have kissed the letter at this place
Will thy lips press it too and remain for a moment on the spot which
has been equally saluted by your

MATILDA


This was the FUST letter and was brot to our house by one of the poar
footmin Fitzclarence at sicks oclock in the morning I thot it was
for life and death and woak master at that extraornary hour and gave
it to him I shall never forgit him when he red it he cramped it up
and he cust and swoar applying to the lady who roat the genlmn that
brought it and me who introjuiced it to his notice such a collection of
epitafs as I seldum hered excep at Billinxgit The fact is thiss for a
fust letter misss noat was RATHER too strong and sentymentle But that
was her way she was always reading melancholy stoary booksThaduse of
Wawsaw the Sorrows of MacWhirter and such like

After about 6 of them master never yoused to read them but handid them
over to me to see if there was anythink in them which must be answered
in order to kip up appearuntses The next letter is


No II

BELOVED to what strange madnesses will passion lead one Lady Griffin
since your avowal yesterday has not spoken a word to your poor Matilda
has declared that she will admit no one heigho not even you my
Algernon and has locked herself in her own dressingroom I do believe
that she is JEALOUS and fancies that you were in love with HER Ha ha
I could have told her ANOTHER TALEnestce pas Adieu adieu adieu A
thousand thousand million kisses

M G

Monday afternoon 2 oclock


There was another letter kem before bedtime for though me and master
called at the Griffinses we wairnt aloud to enter at no price Mortimer
and Fitzclarence grind at me as much as to say we were going to be
relations but I dont spose master was very sorry when he was obleached
to come back without seeing the fare objict of his affeckshns

Well on Chewsdy there was the same game ditto on Wensday only when
we called there who should we see but our father Lord Crabs who was
waiving his hand to Miss Kicksey and saying HE SHOULD BE BACK TO DINNER
AT 7 just as me and master came up the stares There was no admittns
for us though Bah bah never mind says my lord taking his
son affeckshnately by the hand What two strings to your bow ay
Algernon The dowager a little jealous miss a little lovesick But my
ladys fit of anger will vanish and I promise you my boy that you
shall see your fair one tomorrow

And so saying my lord walked master down stares looking at him as
tender and affeckshnat and speaking to him as sweet as posbill Master
did not know what to think of it He never new what game his old father
was at only he somehow felt that he had got his head in a net in spite
of his suxess on Sunday I knew itI knew it quite well as soon as I
saw the old genlmn igsammin him by a kind of smile which came over his
old face and was somethink betwigst the angellic and the direbollicle

But masters dowts were cleared up nex day and every thing was bright
again At brexfast in comes a note with inclosier boath of witch I
here copy


No IX

Thursday morning

Victoria Victoria Mamma has yielded at last not her consent to our
union but her consent to receive you as before and has promised
to forget the past Silly woman how could she ever think of you as
anything but the lover of your Matilda I am in a whirl of delicious
joy and passionate excitement I have been awake all this long night
thinking of thee my Algernon and longing for the blissful hour of
meeting

Come M G


This is the inclosier from my lady


I will not tell you that your behavior on Sunday did not deeply shock
me I had been foolish enough to think of other plans and to fancy your
heart if you had any was fixed elsewhere than on one at whose foibles
you have often laughed with me and whose person at least cannot have
charmed you

My stepdaughter will not I presume marry without at least going
through the ceremony of asking my consent I cannot as yet give it
Have I not reason to doubt whether she will be happy in trusting herself
to you

But she is of age and has the right to receive in her own house all
those who may be agreeable to hercertainly you who are likely to be
one day so nearly connected with her If I have honest reason to believe
that your love for Miss Griffin is sincere if I find in a few months
that you yourself are still desirous to marry her I can of course
place no further obstacles in your way

You are welcome then to return to our hotel I cannot promise to
receive you as I did of old you would despise me if I did I can
promise however to think no more of all that has passed between
us and yield up my own happiness for that of the daughter of my dear
husband

L E G


Well now ant this a manly straitforard letter enough and natral
from a woman whom we had to confess the truth treated most scuvvily
Master thought so and went and made a tender respeckful speach to Lady
Griffin a little flumry costs nothink Grave and sorroflle he kist her
hand and speakin in a very low adgitayted voice calld Hevn to witness
how he deplord that his conduct should ever have given rise to such an
unfornt ideer but if he might offer her esteem respect the warmest
and tenderest admiration he trusted she would accept the same and a
deal moar flumry of the kind with dark sollum glansis of the eyes and
plenty of white pockithankercher

He thought hed make all safe Poar fool he was in a netsich a net as
I never yet see set to ketch a roag in



CHAPTER VI

THE JEWEL


The Shevalier de lOrge the young Frenchmin whom I wrote of in my last
who had been rather shy of his visits while master was coming it so
very strong now came back to his old place by the side of Lady Griffin
there was no love now though betwigst him and master although the
shevallier had got his lady back agin Deuceace being compleatly devoted
to his crookid Veanus

The shevalier was a little pale moddist insinifishnt creature and I
shoodnt have thought from his appearants would have the heart to do
harm to a fli much less to stand befor such a tremendious tiger and
fireeater as my master But I see putty well after a week from his
manner of going onof speakin at master and lookin at him and olding
his lips tight when Deuceace came into the room and glaring at him with
his is that he hated the Honrabble Algernon Percy

Shall I tell you why Because my Lady Griffin hated him hated him wuss
than pison or the devvle or even wuss than her daughterinlaw Praps
you phansy that the letter you have juss red was honest praps you
amadgin that the sean of the reading of the will came on by mere chans
and in the reglar cors of suckmstansies it was all a GAME I tell
youa reglar trap and that extrodnar clever young man my master as
neatly put his foot into it as ever a pocher did in fesnt preserve

The shevalier had his q from Lady Griffin When Deuceace went off the
feald back came De lOrge to her feet not a witt less tender than
befor Por fellow por fellow he really loved this woman He might as
well have foln in love with a boreconstructor He was so blinded and
beat by the power wich she had got over him that if she told him black
was white hed beleave it or if she ordered him to commit murder hed
do it she wanted something very like it I can tell you

Ive already said how in the fust part of their acquaintance master
used to laff at De lOrges bad Inglish and funny ways The little
creature had a thowsnd of these and being small and a Frenchman
master in cors looked on him with that goodhumored kind of contemp
which a good Brittn ot always to show He rayther treated him like an
intelligent munky than a man and ordered him about as if hed bean my
ladys footman

All this munseer took in very good part until after the quarl betwigst
master and Lady Griffin when that lady took care to turn the tables
Whenever master and miss were not present as Ive heard the servants
say she used to laff at shevalliay for his obeajance and sivillatty
to master For her part she wondered how a man of his birth could act
a servnt how any man could submit to such contemsheous behavior from
another and then she told him how Deuceace was always snearing at him
behind his back how in fact he ought to hate him corjaly and how it
was suttaly time to show his sperrit

Well the poar little man beleaved all this from his hart and was angry
or pleased gentle or quarlsum igsactly as my lady liked There got
to be frequint rows betwigst him and master sharp words flung at each
other across the dinnertable dispewts about handing ladies their
smelingbotls or seeing them to their carridge or going in and out of
a roam fust or any such nonsince

For hevns sake I heerd my lady in the midl of one of these tiffs
say pail and the tears trembling in her is do do be calm Mr
Deuceace Monsieur de lOrge I beseech you to forgive him You are
both of you so esteemed lovd by members of this family that for its
peace as well as your own you should forbear to quarrel

It was on the way to the Sally Mangy that this brangling had begun and
it ended jest as they were seating themselves I shall never forgit poar
little De lOrges eyes when my lady said both of you He staird
at my lady for a momint turned pail red lookd wild and then going
round to master shook his hand as if he would have wrung it off Mr
Deuceace only bowd and grind and turned away quite stately Miss
heaved a loud O from her busm and looked up in his face with an
igspreshn jest as if she could have eat him up with love and the little
shevalliay sate down to his soopplate and wus so happy that Im blest
if he wasnt crying He thought the widdow had made her declyration and
would have him and so thought Deuceace who lookd at her for some time
mighty bitter and contempshus and then fell atalking with Miss

Now though master didnt choose to marry Lady Griffin as he might have
done he yet thought fit to be very angry at the notion of her marrying
anybody else and so consquintly was in a fewry at this confision
which she had made regarding her parshaleaty for the French shevaleer

And this Ive perseaved in the cors of my expearants through life that
when you vex him a roags no longer a roag you find him out at onst
when hes in a passion for he shows as it ware his cloven foot the
very instnt you tread on it At least this is what YOUNG roags do it
requires very cool blood and long practis to get over this pint and not
to show your pashn when you feel it and snarl when you are angry Old
Crabs wouldnt do it being like another noblemin of whom I heard the
Duke of Wellington say while waiting behind his gracis chair that if
you were kicking him from behind no one standing before him would know
it from the bewtifle smiling igspreshn of his face Young master hadnt
got so far in the thiefs grammer and when he was angry showd it
And its also to be remarked a very profownd observatin for a footmin
but we have is though we DO wear plush britchis its to be remarked
I say that one of these chaps is much sooner maid angry than another
because honest men yield to other people roags never do honest men
love other people roags only themselves and the slightest thing which
comes in the way of thir beloved objects sets them fewrious Master
hadnt led a life of gambling swindling and every kind of debotch to
be goodtempered at the end of it I prommis you

He was in a pashun and when he WAS in a pashn a more insalent
insuffrable overbearing broot didnt live

This was the very pint to which my lady wished to bring him for I must
tell you that though she had been trying all her might to set master
and the shevalliay by the years she had suxeaded only so far as to
make them hate each profowndly but somehow or other the 2 cox wouldnt
FIGHT

I doant think Deuceace ever suspected any game on the part of her
ladyship for she carried it on so admirally that the quarls which
daily took place betwigst him and the Frenchman never seemed to come
from her on the contry she acted as the reglar peasemaker between
them as Ive just shown in the tiff which took place at the door of
the Sally Mangy Besides the 2 young men though reddy enough to snarl
were natrally unwilling to come to bloes Ill tell you why being
friends and idle they spent their mornins as young fashnabbles
genrally do at billiads fensing riding pistleshooting or some such
improoving study In billiads master beat the Frenchman hollow and
had won a pretious sight of money from him but thats neither here nor
there or as the French say ontry noo at pistleshooting master
could knock down eight immidges out of ten and De lOrge seven and in
fensing the Frenchman could pink the Honorable Algernon down evry one
of his weskit buttns Theyd each of them been out more than onst for
every Frenchman will fight and master had been obleagd to do so in the
cors of his bisniss and knowing each others curridg as well as the
fact that either could put a hundrid bolls running into a hat at 30
yards they wairnt very willing to try such exparrymence upon their own
hats with their own heads in them So you see they kep quiet and only
grould at each other

But today Deuceace was in one of his thundering black humers and when
in this way he wouldnt stop for man or devvle I said that he walked
away from the shevalliay who had given him his hand in his sudden bust
of joyfle goodhumor and who I do bleave would have hugd a shebear
so very happy was he Master walked away from him pale and hotty and
taking his seat at table no moor mindid the brandishments of Miss
Griffin but only replied to them with a pshaw or a dam at one of us
servnts or abuse of the soop or the wine cussing and swearing like a
trooper and not like a wellbred son of a noble British peer

Will your ladyship says he slivering off the wing of a pully ally
bashymall allow me to help you

I thank you no but I will trouble Monsieur de lOrge And towards
that gnlmn she turned with a most tender and fasnating smile

Your ladyship has taken a very sudden admiration for Mr de lOrges
carving You used to like mine once

You are very skilful but today if you will allow me I will partake
of something a little simpler

The Frenchman helped and being so happy in cors spilt the gravy
A great blob of brown sos spurted on to masters chick and myandrewed
down his shertcollar and virgingwhite weskit

Confound you says he M de lOrge you have done this on purpose
And down went his knife and fork over went his tumbler of wine a deal
of it into poar Miss Griffinses lap who looked fritened and ready to
cry

My lady bust into a fit of laffin peel upon peel as if it was the best
joak in the world De lOrge giggled and grind too Pardong says he
meal pardong mong share munseer  And he looked as if he would have
done it again for a penny

  In the long dialogues we have generally ventured to
 change the peculiar spelling of our friend Mr Yellowplush

The little Frenchman was quite in extasis he found himself all of a
suddn at the very top of the trea and the laff for onst turned against
his rivle he actialy had the ordassaty to propose to my lady in English
to take a glass of wine

Veal you says he in his jargin take a glas of Madere viz me mi
ladi And he looked round as if hed igsackly hit the English manner
and pronunciation

With the greatest pleasure says Lady G most graciously nodding at
him and gazing at him as she drank up the wine Shed refused master
before and THIS didnt increase his goodhumer

Well they went on master snarling snapping and swearing making
himself I must confess as much of a blaggard as any I ever see and
my lady employing her time betwigst him and the shevalliay doing every
think to irritate master and flatter the Frenchmn Desert came and by
this time Miss was stockstill with fright the chevaleer half tipsy
with pleasure and gratafied vannaty my lady puffickly raygent with
smiles and master bloo with rage

Mr Deuceace says my lady in a most winning voice after a little
chaffing in which she only worked him up moar and moar may I trouble
you for a few of those grapes they look delicious

For answer master seasd hold of the grayp dish and sent it sliding
down the table to De lOrge upsetting in his way fruitplates
glasses dickanters and heaven knows what

Monsieur de lOrge says he shouting out at the top of his voice
have the goodness to help Lady Griffin She wanted MY grapes long ago
and has found out they are sour

      

There was a dead paws of a moment or so

      

Ah says my lady vous osez minsulter devant mes gens dans ma
propre maisoncest par trop fort monsieur And up she got and flung
out of the room Miss followed her screeching out Mammafor Gods
sakeLady Griffin and here the door slammed on the pair

Her ladyship did very well to speak French DE LORGE WOULD NOT HAVE
UNDERSTOOD HER ELSE as it was he heard quite enough and as the
door clikt too in the presents of me and Messeers Mortimer and
Fitzclarence the family footmen he walks round to my master and hits
him a slap on the face and says prends ca menteur et lache which
means Take that you liar and cowardrayther strong igspreshns for
one genlmn to use to another

Master staggered back and looked bewildered and then he gave a kind
of a scream and then he made a run at the Frenchman and then me and
Mortimer flung ourselves upon him whilst Fitzclarence embraced the
shevalliay

A demain says he clinching his little fist and walking away not
very sorry to git off

When he was fairly down stares we let go of master who swallowed
a goblit of water and then pawsing a little and pullout his pus he
presented to Messeers Mortimer and Fitzclarence a luydor each I will
give you five more tomorrow says he if you will promise to keep
this secrit

And then he walked in to the ladies If you knew says he going up
to Lady Griffin and speaking very slow in cors we were all at the
keyhole the pain I have endured in the last minute in consequence of
the rudeness and insolence of which I have been guilty to your ladyship
you would think my own remorse was punishment sufficient and would
grant me pardon

My lady bowed and said she didnt wish for explanations Mr Deuceace
was her daughters guest and not hers but she certainly would never
demean herself by sitting again at table with him And so saying out she
boltid again

Oh Algernon Algernon says Miss in teers what is this dreadful
mysterythese fearful shocking quarrels Tell me has anything
happened Where where is the chevalier

Master smiled and said Be under no alarm my sweetest Matilda De
lOrge did not understand a word of the dispute he was too much in
love for that He is but gone away for half an hour I believe and will
return to coffee

I knew what masters game was for if miss had got a hinkling of the
quarrel betwigst him and the Frenchman we should have had her screeming
at the Hotel Mirabeu and the juice and all to pay He only stopt
for a few minnits and cumfitted her and then drove off to his friend
Captain Bullseye of the Rifles with whom I spose he talked over this
unplesnt bisniss We fownd at our hotel a note from De lOrge saying
where his secknd was to be seen

Two mornings after there was a parrowgraf in Gallynannys Messinger
which I hear beg leaf to transcribe


FEARFUL DUELYesterday morning at six oclock a meeting took place
in the Bois de Boulogne between the Hon A P Dcece a younger son
of the Earl of Crbs and the Chevalier de lO The chevalier was
attended by Major de M of the Royal Guard and the Hon Mr D
by Captain Bllsye of the British Rifle Corps As far as we have been
able to learn the particulars of this deplorable affair the dispute
originated in the house of a lovely lady one of the most brilliant
ornaments of our embassy and the duel took place on the morning
ensuing

The chevalier the challenged party and the most accomplished amateur
swordsman in Paris waived his right of choosing the weapons and the
combat took place with pistols

The combatants were placed at forty paces with directions to advance
to a barrier which separated them only eight paces Each was furnished
with two pistols Monsieur de lO fired almost immediately and the
ball took effect in the left wrist of his antagonist who dropped the
pistol which he held in that hand He fired however directly with his
right and the chevalier fell to the ground we fear mortally wounded A
ball has entered above his hipjoint and there is very little hope that
he can recover

We have heard that the cause of this desperate duel was a blow which
the chevalier ventured to give to the Hon Mr D If so there is some
reason for the unusual and determined manner in which the duel was
fought

Mr Deuae returned to his hotel whither his excellent father the
Right Hon Earl of Crbs immediately hastened on hearing of the sad
news and is now bestowing on his son the most affectionate parental
attention The news only reached his lordship yesterday at noon while
at breakfast with his Excellency Lord Bobtail our ambassador The noble
earl fainted on receiving the intelligence but in spite of the shock to
his own nerves and health persisted in passing last night by the couch
of his son


And so he did This is a sad business Charles says my lord to me
after seeing his son and settling himself down in our salong Have you
any segars in the house And hark ye send me up a bottle of wine and
some luncheon I can certainly not leave the neighborhood of my dear
boy



CHAPTER VII

THE CONSQUINSIES


The shevalliay did not die for the ball came out of its own accord in
the midst of a violent fever and inflamayshn which was brot on by the
wound He was kept in bed for 6 weeks though and did not recover for a
long time after

As for master his lot Im sorry to say was wuss than that of his
advisary Inflammation came on too and to make an ugly story short
they were obliged to take off his hand at the rist

He bore it in cors like a Trojin and in a month he too was well and
his wound heeld but I never see a man look so like a devvle as he used
sometimes when he looked down at the stump

To be sure in Miss Griffinses eyes this only indeerd him the mor She
sent twenty noats a day to ask for him calling him her beloved her
unfortunat her hero her wictim and I dono what Ive kep some of the
noats as I tell you and curiously sentimentle they are beating the
sorrows of MacWhirter all to nothing

Old Crabs used to come offen and consumed a power of wine and seagars
at our house I bleave he was at Paris because there was an exycution
in his own house in England and his son was a sure find as they say
during his illness and couldnt deny himself to the old genlmn His
eveninx my lord spent reglar at Lady Griffins where as master was
ill I didnt go any more now and where the shevalier wasnt there to
disturb him

You see how that woman hates you Deuceace says my lord one day in
a fit of cander after they had been talking about Lady Griffin SHE
HAS NOT DONE WITH YOU YET I tell you fairly

Curse her says master in a fury lifting up his maimd armcurse
her but I will be even with her one day I am sure of Matilda I took
care to put that beyond the reach of a failure The girl must marry me
for her own sake

FOR HER OWN SAKE O ho Good good My lord lifted his is and said
gravely I understand my dear boy it is an excellent plan

Well says master grinning fearcely and knowingly at his exlent old
father as the girl is safe what harm can I fear from the fiend of a
stepmother

My lord only gev a long whizzle and soon after taking up his hat
walked off I saw him sawnter down the Plas Vandome and go in quite
calmly to the old door of Lady Griffinses hotel Bless his old face
such a puffickly goodnatured kindhearted merry selfish old
scoundrel I never shall see again

His lordship was quite right in saying to master that Lady Griffin
hadnt done with him No moar she had But she never would have thought
of the nex game she was going to play IF SOMEBODY HADNT PUT HER UP TO
IT Who did If you red the above passidge and saw how a venrabble old
genlmn took his hat and sauntered down the Plas Vandome looking hard
and kind at all the nussarymaidsbuns they call them in Francein
the way I leave you to guess who was the author of the nex scheam a
woman suttnly never would have pitcht on it

In the fuss payper which I wrote concerning Mr Deuceaces adventers
and his kind behayvior to Messrs Dawkins and Blewitt I had the honor
of laying before the public a skidewl of my masters detts in witch was
the following itim


 Bills of xchange and IOUs 4963L 0s 0d


The IOUse were trifling say a thowsnd pound The bills amountid to
four thowsnd moar

Now the lor is in France that if a genlmn gives these in England and
a French genlmn gits them in any way he can pursew the Englishman who
has drawn them even though he should be in France Master did not know
this factlaboring under a very common mistak that when onst out of
England he might wissle at all the debts he left behind him

My Lady Griffin sent over to her slissators in London who made
arrangemints with the persons who possest the fine collection of
ortografs on stampt paper which master had left behind him and they
were glad enuff to take any oppertunity of getting back their money

One fine morning as I was looking about in the courtyard of our
hotel talking to the servantgals as was my reglar custom in order to
improve myself in the French languidge one of them comes up to me and
says Tenez Monsieur Charles down below in the office there is
a bailiff with a couple of gendarmes who is asking for your
masteratil des dettes par hasard

I was struck all of a heapthe truth flasht on my minds hi
Toinette says I for that was the gals nameToinette says
I giving her a kiss keep them for two minits as you valyou my
affeckshn and then I gave her another kiss and ran up stares to our
chambers Master had now pretty well recovered of his wound and was
aloud to drive abowt it was lucky for him that he had the strength to
move Sir sir says I the bailiffs are after you and you must run
for your life

Bailiff says he nonsense I dont thank heaven owe a shilling to
any man

Stuff sir says I forgetting my respeck dont you owe money in
England I tell you the bailiffs are here and will be on you in a
moment

As I spoke cling cling ling ling goes the bell of the antyshamber
and there they were sure enough

What was to be done Quick as litening I throws off my livry coat
claps my goold lace hat on masters head and makes him put on my livry
Then I wraps myself up in his dressinggown and lolling down on the
sofa bids him open the dor

There they werethe bailifftwo jondarms with himToinette and an
old waiter When Toinette sees master she smiles and says Dis donc
Charles ou est donc ton maitre Chez lui nestce pas Cest le jeune
a monsieur says she curtsying to the bailiff

The old waiter was just agoing to blurt out Mais ce nest pas when
Toinette stops him and says Laissez donc passer ces messieurs vieux
bete and in they walk the 2 jon darms taking their post in the hall

Master throws open the salong doar very gravely and touching MY hat
says Have you any orders about the cab sir

Why no Chawls says I I shant drive out today

The old bailiff grinned for he understood English having had plenty
of English customers and says in French as master goes out I think
sir you had better let your servant get a coach for I am under the
painful necessity of arresting you au nom de la loi for the sum of
ninetyeight thousand seven hundred francs owed by you to the Sieur
Jacques Francois Lebrun of Paris and he pulls out a number of bills
with masters acceptances on them sure enough

Take a chair sir says I and down he sits and I began to chaff him
as well as I could about the weather my illness my sad axdent having
lost one of my hands which was stuck into my busum and so on

At last after a minnit or two I could contane no longer and bust out
in a horse laff

The old fellow turned quite pail and began to suspect somethink
Hola says he gendarmes a moi a moi Je suis floue vole which
means in English that he was reglar sold

The jondarmes jumped into the room and so did Toinette and the
waiter Grasefly rising from my armchare I took my hand from my
dressinggownd and flinging it open stuck up on the chair one of the
neatest legs ever seen

I then pinted majesticklyto what do you thinkto my PLUSH TITES
those sellabrated inigspressables which have rendered me famous in
Yourope

Taking the hint the jondarmes and the servnts rord out laffing and
so did Charles Yellowplush Esquire I can tell you Old Grippard the
bailiff looked as if he would faint in his chare

I heard a kab galloping like mad out of the hotelgate and knew then
that my master was safe



CHAPTER VIII

THE END OF MR DEUCEACES HISTORY LIMBO


My tail is droring rabidly to a close my suvvice with Mr Deuceace
didnt continyou very long after the last chapter in which I described
my admiral strattyjam and my singlar selfdevocean Theres very few
servnts I can tell you whod have thought of such a contrivance and
very few moar would have eggsycuted it when thought of

But after all beyond the trifling advantich to myself in selling
masters roab de sham which you gentle reader may remember I woar
and in dixcovering a fipun note in one of the pocketsbeyond this
I say there was to poar master very little advantich in what had been
done Its true he had escaped Very good But Frans is not like Great
Brittin a man in a livry coat with 1 arm is pretty easily known and
caught too as I can tell you

Such was the case with master He coodn leave Paris moarover if he
would What was to become in that case of his bridehis unchbacked
hairis He knew that young ladys temprimong as the Parishers say too
well to let her long out of his site She had nine thousand a yer
Shed been in love a duzn times befor and mite be agin The Honrabble
Algernon Deuceace was a little too wide awake to trust much to the
constnsy of so very inflammable a young creacher Heavn bless us it was
a marycle she wasnt earlier married I do bleave from suttn seans
that past betwigst us that shed have married me if she hadnt been
sejuiced by the supearor rank and indianuity of the genlmn in whose
survace I was

Well to use a commin igspreshn the beaks were after him How was he to
manitch He coodn get away from his debts and he wooden quit the fare
objict of his affeckshns He was ableejd then as the French say to
lie perdewgoing out at night like a howl out of a hivybush and
returning in the daytime to his roast For its a maxum in France and I
wood it were followed in Ingland that after dark no man is lible for
his detts and in any of the royal gardensthe Twillaries the Pally
Roil or the Lucksimbug for examplea man may wander from sunrise to
evening and hear nothing of the ojus dunns they ant admitted into
these places of public enjyment and rondyvoo any more than dogs the
centuries at the gardengates having orders to shuit all such

Master then was in this uncomfrable situationneither liking to go
nor to stay peeping out at nights to have an interview with his miss
ableagd to shuffle off her repeated questions as to the reason of all
this disgeise and to talk of his two thowsnd a year jest as if he had
it and didnt owe a shilling in the world

Of course now he began to grow mighty eager for the marritch

He roat as many noats as she had done befor swoar against delay and
cerymony talked of the pleasures of Hyming the ardship that the ardor
of two arts should be allowed to igspire the folly of waiting for the
consent of Lady Griffin She was but a stepmother and an unkind one
Miss was he said a major might marry whom she liked and suttnly had
paid Lady G quite as much attention as she ought by paying her the
compliment to ask her at all

And so they went on The curious thing was that when master was pressed
about his cause for not coming out till nighttime he was misterus
and Miss Griffin when asked why she wooden marry igsprest or rather
DIDNT igspress a simlar secrasy Wasnt it hard the cup seemed to be
at the lip of both of em and yet somehow they could not manitch to
take a drink

But one morning in reply to a most desprat epistol wrote by my master
over night Deuceace delighted gits an answer from his soals beluffd
which ran thus


MISS GRIFFIN TO THE HON A P DEUCEACE

DEARESTYou say you would share a cottage with me there is no need
luckily for that You plead the sad sinking of your spirits at
our delayed union Beloved do you think MY heart rejoices at our
separation You bid me disregard the refusal of Lady Griffin and tell
me that I owe her no further duty

Adored Algernon I can refuse you no more I was willing not to lose a
single chance of reconciliation with this unnatural stepmother Respect
for the memory of my sainted father bid me do all in my power to gain
her consent to my union with you nay shall I own it prudence dictated
the measure for to whom should she leave the share of money accorded to
her by my fathers will but to my fathers child

But there are bounds beyond which no forbearance can go and thank
heaven we have no need of looking to Lady Griffin for sordid wealth we
have a competency without her Is it not so dearest Algernon

Be it as you wish then dearest bravest and best Your poor Matilda
has yielded to you her heart long ago she has no longer need to keep
back her name Name the hour and I will delay no more but seek for
refuge in your arms from the contumely and insult which meet me ever
here

MATILDA

PS Oh Algernon if you did but know what a noble part your dear
father has acted throughout in doing his best endeavors to further
our plans and to soften Lady Griffin It is not his fault that she is
inexorable as she is I send you a note sent by her to Lord Crabs we
will laugh at it soon nestce pas


II

MY LORDIn reply to your demand for Miss Griffins hand in favor of
your son Mr Algernon Deuceace I can only repeat what I before have
been under the necessity of stating to youthat I do not believe a
union with a person of Mr Deuceaces character would conduce to my
stepdaughters happiness and therefore REFUSE MY CONSENT I will
beg you to communicate the contents of this note to Mr Deuceace and
implore you no more to touch upon a subject which you must be aware is
deeply painful to me

I remain your lordships most humble servant

L E GRIFFIN

THE RIGHT HON THE EARL OF CRABS


Hang her ladyship says my master what care I for it As for the
old lord whod been so afishous in his kindness and advice master
recknsiled that pretty well with thinking that his lordship knew he was
going to marry ten thousand a year and igspected to get some share of
it for he roat back the following letter to his father as well as a
flaming one to Miss


Thank you my dear father for your kindness in that awkward business
You know how painfully I am situated just now and can pretty well guess
BOTH THE CAUSES of my disquiet A marriage with my beloved Matilda will
make me the happiest of men The dear girl consents and laughs at
the foolish pretensions of her motherinlaw To tell you the truth I
wonder she yielded to them so long Carry your kindness a step further
and find for us a parson a license and make us two into one We are
both major you know so that the ceremony of a guardians consent is
unnecessary

Your affectionate

ALGERNON DEUCEACE

How I regret that difference between us some time back Matters are
changed now and shall be more still AFTER THE MARRIAGE


I knew what my master meantthat he would give the old lord the money
after he was married and as it was probble that miss would see the
letter he roat he made it such as not to let her see two clearly into
his present uncomfrable situation

I took this letter along with the tender one for Miss reading both
of em in course by the way Miss on getting hers gave an
inegspressable look with the white of her is kist the letter and
prest it to her busm Lord Crabs read his quite calm and then they
fell atalking together and told me to wait awhile and I should git an
anser

After a deal of counseltation my lord brought out a card and there was
simply written on it


 Tomorrow at the Ambassadors at Twelve


Carry that back to your master Chawls says he and bid him not to
fail

You may be sure I stept back to him pretty quick and gave him the card
and the messinge Master looked sattasfied with both but suttnly
not over happy no man is the day before his marridge much more his
marridge with a humpback Harriss though she be

Well as he was agoing to depart this bachelor life he did what every
man in such suckmstances ought to do he made his willthat is he
made a dispasition of his property and wrote letters to his creditors
telling them of his lucky chance and that after his marridge he would
sutnly pay them every stiver BEFORE they must know his povvaty well
enough to be sure that paymint was out of the question

To do him justas he seamd to be inclined to do the thing that was
right now that it didnt put him to any inkinvenients to do so

Chawls says he handing me over a tenpunnote heres your wagis
and thank you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs when
you are married you shall be my valet out of livry and Ill treble
your salary

His vallit praps his butler Yes thought I heres a chancea vallit
to ten thousand a year Nothing to do but to shave him and read his
notes and let my whiskers grow to dress in spick and span black and a
clean shut per day muffings every night in the housekeepers room the
pick of the gals in the servants hall a chap to clean my boots for me
and my masters opera bone reglar once a week I knew what a vallit was
as well as any genlmn in service and this I can tell you hes genrally
a hapier idler handsomer mor genlmnly man than his master He
has more money to spend for genlmn WILL leave their silver in their
waistcoat pockets more suxess among the gals as good dinners and
as good winethat is if hes friends with the butler and friends in
corse they will be if they know which way their interest lies

But these are only cassels in the air what the French call shutter
dEspang It wasnt roat in the book of fate that I was to be Mr
Deuceaces vallit

Days will pass at lasteven days befor a wedding the longist and
unpleasantist day in the whole of a mans life I can tell you excep
may be the day before his hanging and at length Aroarer dawned on
the suspicious morning which was to unite in the bonds of Hyming the
Honrable Algernon Percy Deuceace Exquire and Miss Matilda Griffin My
masters wardrobe wasnt so rich as it had been for hed left the
whole of his nicknax and trumpry of dressingcases and rob dy shams his
bewtifle museum of varnished boots his curous colleckshn of Stulz and
Staub coats when he had been ableaged to quit so suddnly our pore dear
lodginx at the Hotel Mirabew and being incog at a friends house
ad contentid himself with ordring a coople of shoots of cloves from a
common tailor with a suffishnt quantaty of linning

Well he put on the best of his coatsa blue and I thought it my duty
to ask him whether hed want his frock again he was good natured and
said Take it and be hanged to you Halfpast eleven oclock came
and I was sent to look out at the door if there were any suspicious
charicters a precious good nose I have to find a bailiff out I can
tell you and an i which will almost see one round a corner and
presenly a very modest green glass coach droave up and in master
stept I didnt in corse appear on the box because being known my
appearints might have compromised master But I took a short cut and
walked as quick as posbil down to the Rue de Foburg St Honore where
his exlnsy the English ambasdor lives and where marridges are always
performed betwigst English folk at Paris

      

There is almost nex door to the ambasdors hotel another hotel of
that lo kind which the French call cabbyrays or winehouses and jest
as masters green glasscoach pulled up another coach drove off out of
which came two ladies whom I knew pretty wellsuffiz that one had
a humpback and the ingenious reader will know why SHE came there the
other was poor Miss Kicksey who came to see her turned off

Well masters glasscoach droav up jest as I got within a few yards of
the door our carridge I say droav up and stopt Down gits coachmin
to open the door and comes I to give Mr Deuceace an arm when out
of the cabaray shoot four fellows and draw up betwigst the coach and
embassydoar two other chaps go to the other doar of the carridge and
opening it one saysRendezvous M Deuceace Je vous arrete au nom
de la loi which means Get out of that Mr D you are nabbed and
no mistake Master turned gashly pail and sprung to the other side
of the coach as if a serpint had stung him He flung open the door and
was for making off that way but he saw the four chaps standing betwigst
libbarty and him He slams down the front window and screams out
Fouettez cocher which means Go it coachmm in a despert loud
voice but coachmin wooden go it and besides was off his box

The long and short of the matter was that jest as I came up to the door
two of the bums jumped into the carridge I saw all I knew my duty and
so very mornfly I got up behind

Tiens says one of the chaps in the street cest ce drole qui nous a
floure lautre jour I knew em but was too melumcolly to smile

Ou ironsnous donc says coachmin to the genlmn who had got inside

A deep woice from the intearor shouted out in reply to the coachmin A
SAINTE PELAGIE

      

And now praps I ot to dixcribe to you the humors of the prizn of
Sainte Pelagie which is the French for Fleat or Queens Bentch but on
this subject Im rather shy of writing partly because the admiral Boz
has in the history of Mr Pickwick made such a dixcripshun of a prizn
that mine wooden read very amyousingly afterwids and also because
to tell you the truth I didnt stay long in it being not in a humer to
waist my igsistance by passing away the ears of my youth in such a dull
place

My fust errint now was as you may phansy to carry a noat from master
to his destined bride The poar thing was sadly taken aback as I can
tell you when she found after remaining two hours at the Embassy that
her husband didnt make his appearance And so after staying on and on
and yet seeing no husband she was forsed at last to trudge dishconslit
home where I was already waiting for her with a letter from my master

There was no use now denying the fact of his arrest and so he confest
it at onst but he made a cockandbull story of treachery of a friend
infimous fodgery and heaven knows what However it didnt matter much
if he had told her that he had been betrayed by the man in the moon she
would have bleavd him

Lady Griffin never used to appear now at any of my visits She kep one
drawingroom and Miss dined and lived alone in another they quarld so
much that praps it was best they should live apart only my Lord Crabs
used to see both comforting each with that winning and innsnt way he
had He came in as Miss in tears was lisning to my account of masters
seazure and hoping that the prisn wasnt a horrid place with a nasty
horrid dunjeon and a dreadfle jailer and nasty horrid bread and water
Law bless us she had borrod her ideers from the novvles she had been
reading

O my lord my lord says she have you heard this fatal story

Dearest Matilda what For heavens sake you alarm me
Whatyesnois itno it cant be Speak says my lord seizing me
by the choler of my coat What has happened to my boy

Please you my lord says I hes at this moment in prisn no
wusshaving been incarserated about two hours ago

In prison Algernon in prison tis impossible Imprisoned for what
sum Mention it and I will pay to the utmost farthing in my power

Im sure your lordship is very kind says I recklecting the sean
betwixgst him and master whom he wanted to diddil out of a thowsand
lb and youll be happy to hear hes only in for a trifle Five
thousand pound is I think pretty near the mark

Five thousand poundsconfusion says my lord clasping his hands
and looking up to heaven and I have not five hundred Dearest Matilda
how shall we help him

Alas my lord I have but three guineas and you know how Lady Griffin
has the

Yes my sweet child I know what you would say but be of good
cheerAlgernon you know has ample funds of his own

Thinking my lord meant Dawkinss five thousand of which to be sure a
good lump was left I held my tung but I cooden help wondering at Lord
Crabss igstream compashn for his son and Miss with her 10000L a
year having only 3 guineas is her pockit

I took home bless us what a home a long and very inflamble letter
from Miss in which she dixscribed her own sorror at the disappointment
swoar she lovd him only the moar for his misfortns made light of them
as a pusson for a paltry sum of five thousand pound ought never to be
cast down specially as he had a certain independence in view and
vowed that nothing nothing should ever injuice her to part from him
etsettler etsettler

I told master of the conversation which had past betwigst me and my
lord and of his handsome offers and his horrow at hearing of his sons
being taken and likewise mentioned how strange it was that Miss should
only have 3 guineas and with such a fortn bless us I should have thot
that she would always have carried a hundred thowsnd lb in her pockit

At this master only said Pshaw But the rest of the story about his
father seemed to dixquiet him a good deal and he made me repeat it over
agin

He walked up and down the room agytated and it seamd as if a new lite
was breaking in upon him

Chawls says he did you observedid Missdid my father seem
PARTICULARLY INTIMATE with Miss Griffin

How do you mean sir says I

Did Lord Crabs appear very fond of Miss Griffin

He was suttnly very kind to her

Come sir speak at once did Miss Griffin seem very fond of his
lordship

Why to tell the truth sir I must say she seemed VERY fond of him

What did he call her

He called her his dearest gal

Did he take her hand

Yes and he

And he what

He kist her and told her not to be so wery downhearted about the
misfortn which had hapnd to you

I have it now says he clinching his fist and growing gashly
pailI have it nowthe infernal old hoary scoundrel the wicked
unnatural wretch He would take her from me And he poured out a volley
of oaves which are impossbill to be repeatid here

I thot as much long ago and when my lord kem with his vizits so
pretious affeckshnt at my Lady Griffinses I expected some such game
was in the wind Indeed Id heard a somethink of it from the Griffinses
servnts that my lord was mighty tender with the ladies

One thing however was evident to a man of his intleckshal capassaties
he must either marry the gal at onst or he stood very small chance
of having her He must get out of limbo immediantly or his respectid
father might be stepping into his vaykint shoes Oh he saw it all
nowthe fust attempt at arest the marridge fixt at 12 oclock and
the bayliffs fixt to come and intarup the marridgethe jewel praps
betwigst him and De lOrge but no it was the WOMAN who did thata
MAN dont deal such fowl blows igspecially a father to his son a woman
may poar thingshes no other means of reventch and is used to fight
with underhand wepns all her life through

Well whatever the pint might be this Deuceace saw pretty clear that
hed been beat by his father at his own gamea trapp set for him
onst which had been defitted by my presnts of mindanother trap set
afterwids in which my lord had been suxesfle Now my lord roag as he
was was much too goodnatured to do an unkind ackshn mearly for
the sake of doing it Hed got to that pich that he didnt mind
injariesthey were all fair play to himhe gave em and reseavd
them without a thought of mallis If he wanted to injer his son it was
to benefick himself And how was this to be done By getting the hairiss
to himself to be sure The Honrabble Mr D didnt say so but I knew
his feelinx well enoughhe regretted that he had not given the old
genlmn the money he askt for

Poar fello he thought he had hit it but he was wide of the mark after
all

Well but what was to be done It was clear that he must marry the gal
at any ratecootky coot as the French say that is marry her and
hang the igspence

To do so he must first git out of prisnto get out of prisn he must
pay his debtsand to pay his debts he must give every shilling he
was worth Never mind four thousand pound is a small stake to a reglar
gambler igspecially when he must play it or rot for life in prisn and
when if he plays it well it will give him ten thousand a year

So seeing there was no help for it he maid up his mind and
accordingly wrote the follying letter to Miss Griffin


MY ADORED MATILDAYour letter has indeed been a comfort to a poor
fellow who had hoped that this night would have been the most blessed
in his life and now finds himself condemned to spend it within a
prison wall You know the accursed conspiracy which has brought these
liabilities upon me and the foolish friendship which has cost me so
much But what matters We have as you say enough even though I
must pay this shameful demand upon me and five thousand pounds are as
nothing compared to the happiness which I lose in being separated a
night from thee Courage however If I make a sacrifice it is for you
and I were heartless indeed if I allowed my own losses to balance for a
moment against your happiness

Is it not so beloved one IS not your happiness bound up with mine
in a union with me I am proud to think soproud too to offer such a
humble proof as this of the depth and purity of my affection

Tell me that you will still be mine tell me that you will be mine
tomorrow and tomorrow these vile chains shall be removed and I will
be free once moreor if bound only bound to you My adorable Matilda
my betrothed bride Write to me ere the evening closes for I shall
never be able to shut my eyes in slumber upon my prison couch until
they have been first blessed by the sight of a few words from thee
Write to me love write to me I languish for the reply which is to
make or mar me for ever Your affectionate

A P D


Having polisht off this epistol master intrustid it to me to carry
and bade me at the same time to try and give it into Miss Griffins hand
alone I ran with it to Lady Griffinses I found Miss as I desired in
a sollatary condition and I presented her with masters pafewmed Billy

She read it and the number of size to which she gave vint and the
tears which she shed beggar digscription She wep and sighed until I
thought she would bust She even claspt my hand in hers and said O
Charles is he very very miserable

He is maam says I very miserable indeednobody upon my honor
could be miserablerer

On hearing this pethetic remark her mind was made up at onst and
sitting down to her eskrewtaw she immediantly ableaged master with an
answer Here it is in black and white


My prisoned bird shall pine no more but fly home to its nest in these
arms Adored Algernon I will meet thee tomorrow at the same place at
the same hour Then then it will be impossible for aught but death to
divide us

She had just foalded up into its proper triangular shape the noat
transcribed abuff and I was just on the point of saying according to
my masters orders Miss if you please the Honrabble Mr Deuceace
would be very much ableaged to you to keep the seminary which is to take
place tomorrow a profound se when my masters father entered and I
fell back to the door Miss without a word rusht into his arms burst
into teers agin as was her reglar way it must be confest she was of
a very mist constitution and showing to him his sons note cried
Look my dear lord how nobly your Algernon OUR Algernon writes
to me Who can doubt after this of the purity of his matchless
affection

My lord took the letter read it seamed a good deal amyoused and
returning it to its owner said very much to my surprise My dear Miss
Griffin he certainly does seem in earnest and if you choose to make
this match without the consent of your motherinlaw you know the
consequence and are of course your own mistress

Consequencesfor shame my lord A little money more or less what
matters it to two hearts like ours

Hearts are very pretty things my sweet young lady but ThreeperCents
are better

Nay have we not an ample income of our own without the aid of Lady
Griffin

My lord shrugged his shoulders Be it so my love says he Im sure
I can have no other reason to prevent a union which is founded upon such
disinterested affection

And here the conversation dropt Miss retired clasping her hands and
making play with the whites of her is My lord began trotting up and
down the room with his fat hands stuck in his britchis pockits his
countnince lighted up with igstream joy and singing to my inordnit
igstonishment


 See the conquering hero comes
 Tiddy diddy dolltiddy doll doll doll


He began singing this song and tearing up and down the room like mad
I stood amazda new light broke in upon me He wasnt going then to
make love to Miss Griffin Master might marry her Had she not got the
for

I say I was just standing stock still my eyes fixt my hands
puppindicklar my mouf wide open and these igstrordinary thoughts
passing in my mind when my lord having got to the last doll of his
song just as I came to the sillible for of my ventriloquism or
inward speechwe had eatch jest reached the pint digscribed when the
meditations of both were sudnly stopt by my lord in the midst of his
singin and trottin match coming bolt up aginst poar me sending me up
aginst one end of the room himself flying back to the other and it
was only after considrabble agitation that we were at length restored to
anything like a liquilibrium

What YOU here you infernal rascal says my lord

Your lordships very kind to notus me says I I am here And I gave
him a look

He saw I knew the whole game

And after whisling a bit as was his habit when puzzled I bleave
hed have only whisled if he had been told he was to be hanged in five
minits after whisling a bit he stops sudnly and coming up to me
says

Hearkye Charles this marriage must take place tomorrow

Must it sir says I now for my part I dont think

Stop my good fellow if it does not take place what do you gain

This staggerd me If it didnt take place I only lost a situation for
master had but just enough money to pay his detts and it wooden soot my
book to serve him in prisn or starving

Well says my lord you see the force of my argument Now look
here and he lugs out a crisp fluttering snowy HUNDREDPUN NOTE If
my son and Miss Griffin are married tomorrow you shall have this and
I will moreover take you into my service and give you double your
present wages

Flesh and blood cooden bear it My lord says I laying my hand upon
my busm only give me security and Im yours for ever

The old noblemin grind and pattid me on the shoulder Right my
lad says he rightyoure a nice promising youth Here is the best
security And he pulls out his pockitbook returns the hundredpun
bill and takes out one for fifty Here is half today tomorrow you
shall have the remainder

My fingers trembled a little as I took the pretty fluttering bit of
paper about five times as big as any sum of money I had ever had in my
life I cast my i upon the amount it was a fifty sure enougha bank
possbill made payable to Leonora Emilia Griffin and indorsed by her
The cat was out of the bag Now gentle reader I spose you begin to see
the game

Recollect from this day you are in my service

My lord you overpoar me with your faviors

Go to the devil sir says he do your duty and hold your tongue

And thus I went from the service of the Honorabble Algernon Deuceace to
that of his exlnsy the Right Honorabble Earl of Crabs

      

On going back to prisn I found Deuceace locked up in that oajus place
to which his igstravygansies had deservedly led him and felt for him I
must say a great deal of contemp A raskle such as hea swindler who
had robbed poar Dawkins of the means of igsistance who had cheated his
fellowroag Mr Richard Blewitt and who was making a musnary marridge
with a disgusting creacher like Miss Griffin didn merit any compashn on
my purt and I determined quite to keep secret the suckmstansies of my
privit intervew with his exlnsy my presnt master

I gev him Miss Griffinses trianglar which he read with a satasfied air
Then turning to me says he You gave this to Miss Griffin alone

Yes sir

You gave her my message

Yes sir

And you are quite sure Lord Crabs was not there when you gave either
the message or the note

Not there upon my honor says I

Hang your honor sir Brush my hat and coat and go CALL A COACHdo
you hear

      

I did as I was ordered and on coming back found master in whats
called I think the greffe of the prisn The officer in waiting had
out a great register and was talking to master in the French tongue in
coarse a number of poar prisners were looking eagerly on

Let us see my lor says he the debt is 98700 francs there are
capture expenses interest so much and the whole sum amounts to a
hundred thousand francs moins 13

Deuceace in a very myjestic way takes out of his pocketbook four
thowsnd pun notes This is not French money but I presume that you
know it M Greffier says he

The greffier turned round to old Solomon a moneychanger who had one
or two clients in the prisn and hapnd luckily to be there Les billets
sont bons says he Je les prendrai pour cent mille douze cent francs
et jespere my lor de vous revoir

Good says the greffier I know them to be good and I will give my
lor the difference and make out his release

Which was done The poar debtors gave a feeble cheer as the great
dubble iron gates swung open and clang to again and Deuceace stept out
and me after him to breathe the fresh hair

He had been in the place but six hours and was now free againfree
and to be married to ten thousand a year nex day But for all that he
lookt very faint and pale He HAD put down his great stake and when he
came out of Sainte Pelagie he had but fifty pounds left in the world

Never mindwhen onst the moneys down make your mind easy and so
Deuceace did He drove back to the Hotel Mirabew where he ordered
apartmince infinately more splendid than befor and I pretty soon told
Toinette and the rest of the suvvants how nobly he behayved and how
he valyoud four thousnd pound no more than ditch water And such was the
consquincies of my praises and the poplarity I got for us boath that
the delighted landlady immediantly charged him dubble what she would
have done if it hadn been for my stoaries

He ordered splendid apartmince then for the nex week a
carridgeandfour for Fontainebleau tomorrow at 12 precisely and
having settled all these things went quietly to the Roshy de Cancale
where he dined as well he might for it was now eight oclock I
didnt spare the shompang neither that night I can tell you for when
I carried the note he gave me for Miss Griffin in the evening informing
her of his freedom that young lady remarked my hagitated manner of
walking and speaking and said Honest Charles he is flusht with the
events of the day Here Charles is a napoleon take it and drink to
your mistress

I pockitid it but I must say I didnt like the moneyit went against
my stomick to take it



CHAPTER IX

THE MARRIAGE


Well the nex day came at 12 the carridgeandfour was waiting at the
ambasdors doar and Miss Griffin and the faithfle Kicksey were punctial
to the apintment

I dont wish to digscribe the marridge seminaryhow the embasy chapling
jined the hands of this loving young couplehow one of the embasy
footmin was called in to witness the marridgehow Miss wep and fainted
as usialand how Deuceace carried her fainting to the brisky and
drove off to Fontingblo where they were to pass the fust weak of the
honeymoon They took no servnts because they wisht they said to
be privit And so when I had shut up the steps and bid the postilion
drive on I bid ajew to the Honrabble Algernon and went off strait to
his exlent father

Is it all over Chawls said he

I saw them turned off at igsactly a quarter past 12 my lord says I

Did you give Miss Griffin the paper as I told you before her
marriage

I did my lord in the presents of Mr Brown Lord Bobtails man who
can swear to her having had it

I must tell you that my lord had made me read a paper which Lady Griffin
had written and which I was comishnd to give in the manner menshnd
abuff It ran to this effect


According to the authority given me by the will of my late dear
husband I forbid the marriage of Miss Griffin with the Honorable
Algernon Percy Deuceace If Miss Griffin persists in the union I warn
her that she must abide by the consequences of her act

LEONORA EMILIA GRIFFIN

RUE DE RIVOLI May 8 1818


When I gave this to Miss as she entered the cortyard a minnit before my
masters arrivle she only read it contemptiously and said I laugh at
the threats of Lady Griffin and she toar the paper in two and walked
on leaning on the arm of the faithful and obleaging Miss Kicksey

I picked up the paper for fear of axdents and brot it to my lord
Not that there was any necessaty for hed kep a copy and made me and
another witniss my Lady Griffins solissator read them both before he
sent either away

Good says he and he projuiced from his potfolio the fello of that
bewchus fiftypun note which hed given me yesterday I keep my
promise you see Charles says he You are now in Lady Griffins
service in the place of Mr Fitzclarence who retires Go to Frojes
and get a livery

But my lord says I I was not to go into Lady Griffnses service
according to the bargain but into

Its all the same thing says he and he walked off I went to Mr
Frojes and ordered a new livry and found likwise that our coachmin
and Munseer Mortimer had been there too My ladys livery was changed
and was now of the same color as my old coat at Mr Deuceaces and Im
blest if there wasnt a tremenjious great earls corronit on the butins
instid of the Griffin rampint which was worn befoar

I asked no questions however but had myself measured and slep that
night at the Plas Vandome I didnt go out with the carridge for a day
or two though my lady only taking one footmin she said until HER NEW
CARRIDGE was turned out

I think you can guess whats in the wind NOW

I bot myself a dressingcase a box of Ody colong a few duzen lawn
sherts and neckcloths and other things which were necessary for a
genlmn in my rank Silk stockings was provided by the rules of the
house And I completed the bisniss by writing the follying ginteel
letter to my late master

CHAPTER X

THE HONEYMOON


The weak at Fontingblow past quickly away and at the end of it our son
and daughterinlawa pare of nice young tuttleduvsreturned to their
nest at the Hotel Mirabew I suspeck that the COCK turtledove was
preshos sick of his barging

When they arrivd the fust thing they found on their table was a large
parsle wrapt up in silver paper and a newspaper and a couple of cards
tied up with a peace of white ribbing In the parsle was a hansume piece
of plumcake with a deal of sugar On the cards was wrote in Goffick
characters


 Earl of Crabs


And in very small Italian


 Countess of Crabs


And in the paper was the following parrowgraff


MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFEYesterday at the British embassy the Right
Honorable John Augustus Altamont Plantagenet Earl of Crabs to Leonora
Emilia widow of the late LieutenantGeneral Sir George Griffin K C
B An elegant dejeune was given to the happy couple by his Excellency
Lord Bobtail who gave away the bride The elite of the foreign
diplomacy the Prince Talleyrand and Marshal the Duke of Dalmatia on
behalf of H M the King of France honored the banquet and the marriage
ceremony Lord and Lady Crabs intend passing a few weeks at Saint
Cloud


The above dockyments along with my own triffling billy of which I have
also givn a copy greated Mr and Mrs Deuceace on their arrivle from
Fontingblo Not being present I cant say what Deuceace said but I can
fancy how he LOOKT and how poor Mrs Deuceace lookt They werent much
inclined to rest after the fiteeg of the junny for in 12 an hour
after their arrival at Paris the hosses were put to the carridge
agen and down they came thundering to our countryhouse at St Cloud
pronounst by those absud Frenchmin Sing Kloo to interrup our chaste
loves and delishs marridge injyments

My lord was sittn in a crimson satan dressinggown lolling on a sofa at
an open windy smoaking seagars as ushle her ladyship who to du her
justice didn mind the smell occupied another end of the room and
was working in wusted a pare of slippers or an umbrellore case or a
coalskittle or some such nonsints You would have thought to have sean
em that they had been married a sentry at least Well I bust in upon
this conjugal tatortator and said very much alarmed My lord heres
your son and daughterinlaw

Well says my lord quite calm and what then

Mr Deuceace says my lady starting up and looking fritened

Yes my love my son but you need not be alarmed Pray Charles say
that Lady Crabs and I will be very happy to see Mr and Mrs Deuceace
and that they must excuse us receiving them en famille Sit still my
blessingtake things coolly Have you got the box with the papers

My lady pointed to a great green boxthe same from which she had taken
the papers when Deuceace fust saw themand handed over to my lord a
fine gold key I went out met Deuceace and his wife on the stepps gave
my messinge and bowed them palitely in

My lord didnt rise but smoaked away as usual praps a little quicker
but I cant say my lady sat upright looking handsum and strong
Deuceace walked in his left arm tied to his breast his wife and hat on
the other He looked very pale and frightened his wife poar thing had
her head berried in her handkerchief and sobd fit to break her heart

Miss Kicksey who was in the room but I didnt mention her she was
less than nothink in our house went up to Mrs Deuceace at onst and
held out her armsshe had a heart that old Kicksey and I respect her
for it The poor hunchback flung herself into Misss arms with a kind
of whooping screech and kep there for some time sobbing in quite a
historical manner I saw there was going to be a sean and so in cors
left the door ajar

Welcome to Saint Cloud Algy my boy says my lord in a loud hearty
voice You thought you would give us the slip eh you rogue But
we knew it my dear fellow we knew the whole affairdid we not my
souland you see kept our secret better than you did yours

I must confess sir says Deuceace bowing that I had no idea of the
happiness which awaited me in the shape of a motherinlaw

No you dog no no says my lord giggling old birds you know not
to be caught with chaff like young ones But here we are all spliced
and happy at last Sit down Algernon let us smoke a segar and talk
over the perils and adventures of the last month My love says my
lord turning to his lady you have no malice against poor Algernon I
trust Pray shake HIS HAND A grin

But my lady rose and said I have told Mr Deuceace that I never
wished to see him or speak to him more I see no reason now to
change my opinion And herewith she sailed out of the room by the door
through which Kicksey had carried poor Mrs Deuceace

Well well says my lord as Lady Crabs swept by I was in hopes she
had forgiven you but I know the whole story and I must confess you
used her cruelly ill Two strings to your bowthat was your game was
it you rogue

Do you mean my lord that you know all that past between me and Lady
GrifLady Crabs before our quarrel

Perfectlyyou made love to her and she was almost in love with
you you jilted her for money she got a man to shoot your hand off in
revenge no more diceboxes now Deuceace no more sauter la coupe I
cant think how the deuce you will manage to live without them

Your lordship is very kind but I have given up play altogether says
Deuceace looking mighty black and uneasy

Oh indeed Benedick has turned a moral man has he This is better and
better Are you thinking of going into the church Deuceace

My lord may I ask you to be a little more serious

Serious a quoi bon I am seriousserious in my surprise that when
you might have had either of these women you should have preferred that
hideous wife of yours

May I ask you in turn how you came to be so little squeamish about
a wife as to choose a woman who had just been making love to your own
son says Deuceace growing fierce

How can you ask such a question I owe forty thousand poundsthere
is an execution at Sizes Hallevery acre I have is in the hands of
my creditors and thats why I married her Do you think there was any
love Lady Crabs is a devlish fine woman but shes not a foolshe
married me for my coronet and I married her for her money

Well my lord you need not ask me I think why I married the
daughterinlaw

Yes but I DO my dear boy How the deuce are you to live Dawkinss
five thousand pounds wont last forever and afterwards

You dont mean my lordyou dontI mean you cant D says he
starting up and losing all patience you dont dare to say that Miss
Griffin had not a fortune of ten thousand a year

My lord was rolling up and wetting betwigst his lips another segar he
lookt up after he had lighted it and said quietly

Certainly Miss Griffin had a fortune of ten thousand a year

Well sir and has she not got it now Has she spent it in a week

SHE HAS NOT GOT A SIXPENCE NOW SHE MARRIED WITHOUT HER MOTHERS
CONSENT

Deuceace sunk down in a chair and I never see such a dreadful picture
of despair as there was in the face of that retchid manhe writhed
and nasht his teeth he tore open his coat and wriggled madly the stump
of his left hand until fairly beat he threw it over his livid pale
face and sinking backwards fairly wept alowd

Bah its a dreddfle thing to hear a man crying his pashn torn up from
the very roots of his heart as it must be before it can git such a
vent My lord meanwhile rolled his segar lighted it and went on

My dear boy the girl has not a shilling I wished to have left you
alone in peace with your four thousand pounds you might have lived
decently upon it in Germany where money is at 5 per cent where your
duns would not find you and a couple of hundred a year would have kept
you and your wife in comfort But you see Lady Crabs would not listen
to it You had injured her and after she had tried to kill you and
failed she determined to ruin you and succeeded I must own to you
that I directed the arresting business and put her up to buying your
protested bills she got them for a trifle and as you have paid them
has made a good two thousand pounds by her bargain It was a painful
thing to be sure for a father to get his son arrested but que
voulezvous I did not appear in the transaction she would have you
ruined and it was absolutely necessary that YOU should marry before I
could so I pleaded your cause with Miss Griffin and made you the happy
man you are You rogue you rogue you thought to match your old father
did you But never mind lunch will be ready soon In the meantime
have a segar and drink a glass of Sauterne

Deuceace who had been listening to this speech sprung up wildly

Ill not believe it he said its a lie an infernal lie forged
by you you hoary villain and by the murderess and strumpet you have
married Ill not believe it show me the will Matilda Matilda
shouted he screaming hoarsely and flinging open the door by which she
had gone out

Keep your temper my boy You ARE vexed and I feel for you but dont
use such bad language it is quite needless believe me

Matilda shouted out Deuceace again and the poor crooked thing came
trembling in followed by Miss Kicksey

Is this true woman says he clutching hold of her hand

What dear Algernon says she

What screams out Deuceacewhat Why that you are a beggar for
marrying without your mothers consentthat you basely lied to me in
order to bring about this matchthat you are a swindler in conspiracy
with that old fiend yonder and the shedevil his wife

It is true sobbed the poor woman that I have nothing but

Nothing but what Why dont you speak you drivelling fool

I have nothingbut you dearest have two thousand a year Is that
not enough for us You love me for myself dont you Algernon You have
told me so a thousand timessay so again dear husband and do not do
not be so unkind And here she sank on her knees and clung to him and
tried to catch his hand and kiss it

How much did you say says my lord

Two thousand a year sir he has told us so a thousand times

TWO THOUSAND Two thouho ho hohaw haw haw roars my lord
That is I vow the best thing I ever heard in my life My dear
creature he has not a shillingnot a single maravedi by all the gods
and goddesses And this exlnt noblemin began laffin louder than ever a
very kind and feeling genlmn he was as all must confess

There was a paws and Mrs Deuceace didn begin cussing and swearing at
her husband as he had done at her she only said O Algernon is this
true and got up and went to a chair and wep in quiet

My lord opened the great box If you or your lawyers would like to
examine Sir Georges will it is quite at your service you will see
here the proviso which I mentioned that gives the entire fortune to
Lady GriffinLady Crabs that is and here my dear boy you see the
danger of hasty conclusions Her ladyship only showed you the FIRST PAGE
OF THE WILL of course she wanted to try you You thought you made a
great stroke in at once proposing to Miss Griffindo not mind it my
love he really loves you now very sincerelywhen in fact you
would have done much better to have read the rest of the will You were
completely bitten my boyhumbugged bamboozleday and by your old
father you dog I told you I would you know when you refused to lend
me a portion of your Dawkins money I told you I would and I DID I had
you the very next day Let this be a lesson to you Percy my boy dont
try your luck again against such old hands look deuced well before you
leap audi alteram partem my lad which means read both sides of the
will I think lunch is ready but I see you dont smoke Shall we go
in

Stop my lord says Mr Deuceace very humble I shall not share your
hospitalitybutbut you know my condition I am pennilessyou know
the manner in which my wife has been brought up

The Honorable Mrs Deuceace sir shall always find a home here as if
nothing had occurred to interrupt the friendship between her dear mother
and herself

And for me sir says Deuceace speaking faint and very slow I
hopeI trustI think my lord you will not forget me

Forget you sir certainly not

And that you will make some provision

Algernon Deuceace says my lord getting up from the sophy and
looking at him with sich a jolly malignity as I never see I declare
before heaven that I will not give you a penny

Hereupon my lord held out his hand to Mrs Deuceace and said My dear
will you join your mother and me We shall always as I said have a
home for you

My lord said the poar thing dropping a curtsy my home is with
HIM

      

About three months after when the season was beginning at Paris and
the autumn leafs was on the ground my lord my lady me and Mortimer
were taking a stroal in the Boddy Balong the carridge driving on slowly
ahead and us as happy as possbill admiring the pleasant woods and the
goldn sunset

My lord was expayshating to my lady upon the exquizit beauty of the
sean and pouring forth a host of butifle and virtuous sentaments
sootable to the hour It was dalitefle to hear him Ah said he
black must be the heart my love which does not feel the influence
of a scene like this gathering as it were from those sunlit skies
a portion of their celestial gold and gaining somewhat of heaven with
each pure draught of this delicious air

Lady Crabs did not speak but prest his arm and looked upwards Mortimer
and I too felt some of the infliwents of the sean and lent on our
goold sticks in silence The carriage drew up close to us and my lord
and my lady sauntered slowly tords it

Jest at the place was a bench and on the bench sate a poorly drest
woman and by her leaning against a tree was a man whom I thought Id
sean befor He was drest in a shabby blew coat with white seems and
copper buttons a torn hat was on his head and great quantaties of
matted hair and whiskers disfiggared his countnints He was not shaved
and as pale as stone

My lord and lady didn tak the slightest notice of him but past on to
the carridge Me and Mortimer lickwise took OUR places As we past the
man had got a grip of the womans shoulder who was holding down her
head sobbing bitterly

No sooner were my lord and lady seated than they both with igstream
dellixy and good natur burst into a ror of lafter peal upon peal
whooping and screaching enough to frighten the evening silents

DEUCEACE turned round I see his face nowthe face of a devvle of hell
Fust he lookt towards the carridge and pinted to it with his maimed
arm then he raised the other AND STRUCK THE WOMAN BY HIS SIDE She
fell screaming

Poor thing Poor thing




MR YELLOWPLUSHS AJEW


The end of Mr Deuceaces history is going to be the end of my
corrispondince I wish the public was as sory to part with me as I am
with the public becaws I fansy reely that weve become frends and feal
for my part a becoming greaf at saying ajew

Its imposbill for me to continyow however awritin as I have
donevioletting the rules of authography and trampling upon the fust
princepills of English grammar When I began I knew no better when Id
carrid on these papers a little further and grew accustmd to writin I
began to smel out somethink quear in my style Within the last sex weaks
I have been learning to spell and when all the world was rejoicing at
the festivvaties of our youthful Queanwhen all is were fixed upon
her long sweet of ambasdors and princes following the splendid carridge
of Marshle the Duke of Damlatiar and blinking at the pearls and dimince
of Prince OystereasyYellowplush was in his loanly pantryHIS eyes
were fixt upon the spellingbookhis heart was bent upon mastring the
diffickleties of the littery professhn I have been in fact CONVERTID


 This was written in 1838


You shall here how Ours you know is a Wig house and ever sins his
third son has got a place in the Treasury his secknd a captingsy in the
Guards his fust the secretary of embasy at Pekin with a prospick
of being appinted ambasdor at Loo Chooever sins masters sons have
reseaved these attentions and master himself has had the promis of a
pearitch he has been the most reglar consistnt honrabble Libbaral in
or out of the House of Commins

Well being a Whig its the fashn as you know to reseave littery
pipple and accordingly at dinner tother day whose name do you think
I had to hollar out on the fust landingplace about a wick ago After
several dukes and markises had been enounced a very gentell fly drives
up to our doar and out steps two gentlemen One was pail and wor
spektickles a wig and a white neckcloth The other was slim with a
hook nose a pail fase a small waist a pare of falling shoulders a
tight coat and a catarack of black satting tumbling out of his busm
and falling into a gilt velvet weskit The little genlmn settled his
wigg and pulled out his ribbins the younger one fluffed the dust of
his shoes looked at his whiskers in a little pockitglas settled his
crevatt and they both mounted upstairs

What name sir says I to the old genlmn

Namea now you thief o the wurrld says he do you pretind
nat to know ME Say its the Cabinet Cyclopano I mane the Litherary
Chranpshabluthanownssay its DOCTHOR DIOCLESIAN LARNERI think
hell know me noway Nid But the genlmn called Nid was at the botm
of the stare and pretended to be very busy with his shoostring So the
little genlmn went upstares alone

DOCTOR DIOLESIUS LARNER says I

DOCTOR ATHANASIUS LARDNER says Greville FitzRoy our secknd footman
on the fust landingplace

DOCTOR IGNATIUS LOYOLA says the groom of the chambers who pretends
to be a scholar and in the little genlmn went When safely housed
the other chap came and when I asked him his name said in a thick
gobbling kind of voice

Sawedwadgeorgeearllittnbulwig

Sir what says I quite agast at the name

Sawedwadno I mean MISTAWedwad Lyttn Bulwig

My neas trembled under me my is fild with tiers my voice shook as
I past up the venrabble name to the other footman and saw this fust of
English writers go up to the drawingroom

Its needless to mention the names of the rest of the compny or to
dixcribe the suckmstansies of the dinner Suffiz to say that the two
littery genlmn behaved very well and seamed to have good appytights
igspecially the little Irishman in the whig who et drunk and talked
as much as a duzn He told how hed been presented at cort by his
friend Mr Bulwig and how the Quean had received em both with a
dignity undigscribable and how her blessid Majisty asked what was the
bony fidy sale of the Cabinit Cyclopaedy and how be Doctor Larner
told her that on his honner it was under ten thowsnd

You may guess that the Doctor when he made this speach was pretty far
gone The fact is that whether it was the coronation or the goodness
of the wine cappitle it is in our house I can tell you or the natral
propensaties of the gests assembled which made them so igspecially
jolly I dont know but they had kep up the meating pretty late and
our poar butler was quite tired with the perpechual baskits of clarrit
which hed been called upon to bring up So that about 11 oclock if I
were to say they were merry I should use a mild term if I wer to say
they were intawsicated I should use a nigspresshn more near to the
truth but less rispeckful in one of my situashn

The cumpany reseaved this annountsmint with mute extonishment

Pray Doctor Larnder says a spiteful genlmn willing to keep up the

This wigmawole said Mr Bulwig who seemed rather disgusted that his
friend should take up so much of the convassation this wigmawole
is all vewy well but its cuwious that you dont wemember in
chawactewising the litewawy mewits of the vawious magazines cwonicles
weviews and encyclopaedias the existence of a cwitical weview and
litewary chwonicle which though the aewa of its appeawance is
dated only at a vewy few months pwevious to the pwesent pewiod is
nevertheless so wemarkable for its intwinsic mewits as to be wead not
in the metwopolis alone but in the countwynot in Fwance merely
but in the west of Euwopewhewever our pure Wenglish is spoken it
stwetches its peaceful sceptrepewused in Amewica fwom New York to
Ningawawepwinted in Canada from Montweal to Towontoand as I am
gwatified to hear fwom my fwend the governor of Cape Coast Castle
wegularly weceived in Afwica and twanslated into the Mandingo
language by the missionawies and the bushwangers I need not say
gentlemensirthat is Mr SpeakerI mean Sir Johnthat I allude
to the Litewary Chwonicle of which I have the honor to be pwincipal
contwibutor

Very true my dear Mr Bullwig says my master you and I being
Whigs must of course stand by our own friends and I will agree
without a moments hesitation that the Literary whatdyecallem is
the prince of periodicals

The pwince of pewiodicals says Bullwig my dear Sir John its the
empewow of the pwess

Soitlet it be the emperor of the press as you poetically call it
but between ourselves confess itDo not the Tory writers beat your
Whigs hollow You talk about magazines Look at

Look at hwat shouts out Larder Theres none Sir Jan compared to
ourrs

Pardon me I think that

It is Bentleys Mislany you mane says Ignatius as sharp as a
niddle

Why no but

O thin its Coburn sure and that divvle Thayodora pretty paper
sir but lightthrashy milkandwatherynot sthrong like the
Litherary Chrangood luck to it

Why Doctor Lander I was going to tell at once the name of the
periodical its FRASERS MAGAZINE

FRESER says the Doctor O thunder and turf

FWASER says Bullwig Oahhumhawyesnowhythat is
weallyno weally upon my weputation I never before heard the name
of the pewiodical By the by Sir John what wemarkable good clawet this
is is it Lawose or Laff

Laff indeed he cooden git beyond laff and Im blest if I could kip
it neitherfor hearing him pretend ignurnts and being behind the
skreend settlin somethink for the genlmn I bust into such a raw of
laffing as never was igseeded

Hullo says Bullwig turning red Have I said anything impwobable
aw widiculous for weally I never befaw wecollect to have heard in
society such a twemendous peal of cachinnationthat which the twagic
bard who fought at Mawathon has called an anewithmon gelasma

Why be the holy piper says Larder I think you are dthrawing a
little on your imagination Not read Fraser Dont believe him my lord
duke he reads every word of it the rogue The boys about that magazine
baste him as if he was a sack of oatmale My reason for crying out Sir
Jan was because you mintioned Fraser at all Bullwig has every
syllable of it be heartfrom the pailitix down to the Yellowplush
Correspondence

Ha ha says Bullwig affecting to laff you may be sure my ears
prickt up when I heard the name of the Yellowplush Correspondence
Ha ha why to tell truth I HAVE wead the cowespondence to which you
allude its a gweat favowite at court I was talking with Spwing Wice
and John Wussell about it the other day

Well and what do you think of it says Sir John looking mity
waggishfor he knew it was me who roat it

Why weally and twuly theres considewable cleverness about the
cweature but its low disgustingly low it violates pwabability and
the orthogwaphy is so carefully inaccuwate that it requires a positive
study to compwehend it

Yes faith says Larner the arthagraphy is detestible its as bad
for a man to write bad spillin as it is for em to speak wid a brrogue
Iducation furst and ganius afterwards Your health my lord and good
luck to you

Yaw wemark says Bullwig is vewy appwopwiate You will wecollect
Sir John in Hewodotus as for you Doctor you know more about Iwish
than about Gweekyou will wecollect without doubt a stowy nawwated
by that cwedulous though fascinating chwonicler of a certain kind of
sheep which is known only in a certain distwict of Awabia and of which
the tail is so enormous that it either dwaggles on the gwound or is
bound up by the shepherds of the country into a small wheelbawwow or
cart which makes the chwonicler sneewingly wemark that thus the sheep
of Awabia have their own chawiots I have often thought sir this
clawet is weally nectaweousI have often I say thought that the
wace of man may be compawed to these Awabian sheepgenius is our tail
education our wheelbawwow Without art and education to pwop it this
genius dwops on the gwound and is polluted by the mud or injured
by the wocks upon the way with the wheelbawwow it is stwengthened
incweased and supporteda pwide to the owner a blessing to mankind

A very appropriate simile says Sir John and I am afraid that the
genius of our friend Yellowplush has need of some such support

Apropos said Bullwig who IS Yellowplush I was given to understand
that the name was only a fictitious one and that the papers were
written by the author of the Diary of a Physician if so the man has
wonderfully improved in style and there is some hope of him

Bah says the Duke of Doublejowl everybody knows its Barnard the
celebrated author of Sam Slick

Pardon my dear duke says Lord Bagwig its the authoress of High
Life Almacks and other fashionable novels

Fiddlesticks end says Doctor Larner dont be blushing and
pretinding to ask questions dont we know you Bullwig Its
you yourself you thief of the world we smoked you from the very
beginning

Bullwig was about indignantly to reply when Sir John interrupted them
and saidI must correct you all gentlemen Mr Yellowplush is no
other than Mr Yellowplush he gave you my dear Bullwig your last
glass of champagne at dinner and is now an inmate of my house and an
ornament of my kitchen

Gad says Doublejowl lets have him up

Hear hear says Bagwig

Ah now says Larner your grace is not going to call up and talk to
a footman sure Is it gintale

To say the least of it says Bullwig the pwactice is iwwegular and
indecowous and I weally dont see how the interview can be in any way
pwofitable

But the vices of the company went against the two littery men and
everybody excep them was for having up poor me The bell was wrung
butler came Send up Charles says master and Charles who was
standing behind the skreand was persnly abliged to come in

Charles says master I have been telling these gentlemen who is the
author of the Yellowplush Correspondence in Frasers Magazine

Its the best magazine in Europe says the duke

And no mistake says my lord

Hwhat says Larner and wheres the Litherary Chran

I said myself nothink but made a bough and blusht like
picklecabbitch

Mr Yellowplush says his grace will you in the first place drink
a glass of wine

I boughed agin

And what wine do you prefer sir humble port or imperial burgundy

Why your grace says I I know my place and aint above kitchin
wines I will take a glass of port and drink it to the health of this
honrabble compny

When Id swigged off the bumper which his grace himself did me the
honor to pour out for me there was a silints for a minnit when my
master said

Charles Yellowplush I have perused your memoirs in Frasers Magazine
with so much curiosity and have so high an opinion of your talents as a
writer that I really cannot keep you as a footman any longer or allow
you to discharge duties for which you are now quite unfit With all my
admiration for your talents Mr Yellowplush I still am confident that
many of your friends in the servantshall will clean my boots a great
deal better than a gentleman of your genius can ever be expected to
doit is for this purpose I employ footmen and not that they may be
writing articles in magazines Butyou need not look so red my good
fellow and had better take another glass of portI dont wish to throw
you upon the wide world without the means of a livelihood and have made
interest for a little place which you will have under government and
which will give you an income of eighty pounds per annum which you can
double I presume by your literary labors

Sir says I clasping my hands and busting into tears do notfor
heavens sake do notthink of any such think or drive me from your
suvvice because I have been fool enough to write in magaseens Glans
but one moment at your honors plateevery spoon is as bright as a
mirror condysend to igsamine your shoesyour honor may see reflected
in them the fases of every one in the company I blacked them shoes I
cleaned that there plate If occasionally Ive forgot the footman in
the litterary man and committed to paper my remindicences of fashnabble
life it was from a sincere desire to do good and promote nollitch and
I appeal to your honorI lay my hand on my busm and in the fase of
this noble company beg you to say When you rung your bell who came to
you fust When you stopt out at Brookes till morning who sat up for
you When you was ill who forgot the natral dignities of his station
and answered the twopair bell Oh sir says I I know whats what
dont send me away I know them littery chaps and beleave me Id
rather be a footman The works not so hardthe pay is better the
vittels incompyrably supearor I have but to clean my things and run my
errints and you put clothes on my back and meat in my mouth Sir Mr
Bullwig ant I right shall I quit MY station and sinkthat is to say
riseto YOURS

Bullwig was violently affected a tear stood in his glistening i
Yellowplush says he seizing my hand you ARE right Quit not your
present occupation black boots clean knives wear plush all your
life but dont turn literary man Look at me I am the first novelist
in Europe I have ranged with eagle wing over the wide regions of
literature and perched on every eminence in its turn I have gazed with
eagle eyes on the sun of philosophy and fathomed the mysterious depths
of the human mind All languages are familiar to me all thoughts are
known to me all men understood by me I have gathered wisdom from
the honeyed lips of Plato as we wandered in the gardens of
Acadameswisdom too from the mouth of Job Johnson as we smoked
our backy in Seven Dials Such must be the studies and such is the
mission in this world of the PoetPhilosopher But the knowledge
is only emptiness the initiation is but misery the initiated a man
shunned and bannd by his fellows Oh said Bullwig clasping his
hands and throwing his fine is up to the chandelier the curse of
Pwometheus descends upon his wace Wath and punishment pursue them
from genewation to genewation Wo to genius the heavenscaler the
firestealer Wo and thrice bitter desolation Earth is the wock on
which Zeus wemorseless stwetches his withing victimmen the vultures
that feed and fatten on him Ai ai it is agony eternalgwoaning and
solitawy despair And you Yellowplush would penetwate these mystewies
you would waise the awful veil and stand in the twemendous Pwesence
Beware as you value your peace beware Withdwaw wash Neophyte
For heavens sakeO for heavens sakehere he looked round with
agonygive me a glass of bwandyandwater for this clawet is beginning
to disagwee with me

Bullwig having concluded this spitch very much to his own
sattasfackshn looked round to the compny for aplaws and then swigged
off the glass of brandyandwater giving a sollum sigh as he took the
last gulph and then Doctor Ignatius who longed for a chans and in
order to show his independence began flatly contradicting his friend
addressed me and the rest of the genlmn present in the following
manner

Hark ye says he my gossoon doant be led asthray by the nonsinse
of that divil of a Bullwig Hes jillous of ye my bhoy thats the
rale undoubted thruth and its only to keep you out of litherary
life that hes palavering you in this way Ill tell you whatPlush ye
blackguardmy honorable frind the mimber there has told me a hunder
times by the smallest computation of his intense admiration of your
talents and the wonderful sthir they were making in the world He cant
bear a rival Hes mad with envy hatred oncharatableness Look at
him Plush and look at me My father was not a juke exactly nor aven
a markis and see nevertheliss to what a pitch I am come I spare no
ixpinse Im the iditor of a cople of pariodicals I dthrive about in me
carridge I dine wid the lords of the land and whyin the name of the
piper that pleed before Mosus hwy Because Im a litherary man Because
I know how to play me cards Because Im Docther Larner in fact and
mimber of every society in and out of Europe I might have remained
all my life in Thrinity Colledge and never made such an incom as that
offered you by Sir Jan but I came to Londonto London my boy and now
see Look again at me friend Bullwig He IS a gentleman to be sure and
bad luck to im say I and what has been the result of his litherary
labor Ill tell you what and Ill tell this gintale society by the
shade of Saint Patrick theyre going to make him a BARINET

A BARNET Doctor says I you dont mean to say theyre going to make
him a barnet

As sure as Ive made meself a docthor says Larner

What a baronet like Sir John

The divle a bit else

And pray what for

What faw says Bullwig Ask the histowy of litwatuwe what faw Ask
Colburn ask Bentley ask Saunders and Otley ask the gweat Bwitish
nation what faw The blood in my veins comes puwified thwough ten
thousand years of chivalwous ancestwy but that is neither here
nor there my political principlesthe equal wights which I have
advocatedthe gweat cause of fweedom that I have celebwated are known
to all But this I confess has nothing to do with the question No
the question is thison the thwone of litewature I stand unwivalled
pweeminent and the Bwitish government honowing genius in me
compliments the Bwitish nation by lifting into the bosom of the
heweditawy nobility the most gifted member of the democwacy The
honrabble genlm here sunk down amidst repeated cheers

Sir John says I and my lord duke the words of my rivrint frend
Ignatius and the remarks of the honrabble genlmn who has just sate
down have made me change the detummination which I had the honor of
igspressing just now

I igsept the eighty pound a year knowing that I shall ave plenty of
time for pursuing my littery career and hoping some day to set on that
same bentch of barranites which is deckarated by the presnts of my
honrabble friend

Why shooden I Its trew I aint done anythink as YET to deserve
such an honor and its very probable that I never shall But
what thenquaw dong as our friends say Id much rayther have a
coatofarms than a coat of livry Id much rayther have my bludred
hand spralink in the middle of a shield than underneath a teatray A
barranit I will be and in consiquints must cease to be a footmin

As to my politticle princepills these I confess aint settled
they are I know necessary but they aint necessary UNTIL ASKT FOR
besides I reglar read the Sattarist newspaper and so ignirince on this
pint would be inigscusable

But if one man can git to be a doctor and another a barranit and
another a capting in the navy and another a countess and another the
wife of a governor of the Cape of Good Hope I begin to perseave that
the littery trade aint such a very bad un igspecially if youre up to
snough and know whats oclock Ill learn to make myself usefle in
the fust place then Ill larn to spell and I trust by reading the
novvles of the honrabble member and the scientafick treatiseses of the
reverend doctor I may find the secrit of suxess and git a litell for
my own share Ive sevral frends in the press having paid for many of
those chaps drink and given them other treets and so I think Ive got
all the emilents of suxess therefore I am detummined as I said to
igsept your kind offer and beg to withdraw the wuds which I made yous
of when I refyoused your hoxpatable offer I must however

I wish youd withdraw yourself said Sir John bursting into a most
igstrorinary rage and not interrupt the company with your infernal
talk Go down and get us coffee and hark ye hold your impertinent
tongue or Ill break every bone in your body You shall have the place
as I said and while youre in my service you shall be my servant but
you dont stay in my service after tomorrow Go down stairs sir and
dont stand staring here

      

In this abrupt way my evening ended its with a melancholy regret that
I think what came of it I dont wear plush any more I am an altered a
wiser and I trust a better man

Im about a novvle having made great progriss in spelling in the
style of my friend Bullwig and preparing for publigation in the
Doctors Cyclopedear The Lives of Eminent British and Foring
Wosherwomen



SKIMMINGS FROM THE DAIRY OF GEORGE IV


CHARLES YELLOWPLUSH ESQ TO OLIVER YORKE ESQ

DEAR WHYTakin advantage of the Crismiss holydays Sir John and me
who is a member of parlyment had gone down to our place in Yorkshire
for six wicks to shoot grows and woodcox and enjoy old English
hospitalaty This ugly Canady bisniss unluckaly put an end to our
sports in the country and brot us up to Buckly Square as fast as four
posterses could gallip When there I found your parcel containing the
two vollumes of a new book which as I have been away from the literary
world and emplied solely in athlatic exorcises have been laying
neglected in my pantry among my knifecloaths and dekanters and
blackingbottles and bedroom candles and things


 These Memoirs were originally published in Frasers Magazine and it
may be stated for the benefit of the unlearned in such matters that
Oliver Yorke is the assumed name of the editor of that periodical


This will Im sure account for my delay in notussing the work I see
sefral of the papers and magazeens have been befoarhand with me and
have given their apinions concerning it specially the Quotly Revew
which has most mussilessly cut to peases the author of this Dairy of the
Times of George IV


 Diary illustrative of the Times of George the Fourth interspersed
with Original Letters from the late Queen Caroline and from various
other distinguished Persons

 Tot ou tard tout se scaitMAINTENON

In 2 vols London 1838 Henry Colburn


That its a woman who wrote it is evydent from the style of the writing
as well as from certain proofs in the book itself Most suttnly a femail
wrote this Dairy but who this Dairymaid may be I in coarse cant
conjecter and indeed common galliantry forbids me to ask I can only
judge of the book itself which it appears to me is clearly trenching
upon my ground and favrite subjicks viz fashnabble life as igsibited
in the houses of the nobility gentry and rile fammly

But I bare no mallisinfamation is infamation and it doesnt matter
where the infamy comes from and whether the Dairy be from that
distinguished pen to which it is ornarily attributedwhether I say
it comes from a lady of honor to the late quean or a scullion to that
diffunct majisty no matter all we ask is nollidge never mind how we
have it Nollidge as our cook says is like trikelpossitits always
good though you was to drink it out of an old shoo

Well then although this Dairy is likely searusly to injur my pussonal
intrests by fourstalling a deal of what I had to say in my private
memoarsthough many many guineas is taken from my pockit by
cuttin short the tail of my narratifthough much that I had to say in
souperior languidge greased with all the ellygance of my orytory the
benefick of my classcle reading the chawms of my agreble wit is thus
abruply brot befor the world by an inferior genus neither knowing nor
writing English yet I say that nevertheless I must say what I am
puffickly prepaired to say to gainsay which no man can say a wordyet
I say that I say I consider this publication welkom Far from viewing
it with enfy I greet it with applaws because it increases that most
exlent specious of nollidge I mean FASHNABBLE NOLLIDGE compayred
to witch all other nollidge is nonsincea bag of goold to a pare of
snuffers

Could Lord Broom on the Canady question say moar or say what he had
tu say better We are marters both of us to prinsple and every body
who knows eather knows that we would sacrafice anythink rather than
that Fashion is the goddiss I adoar This delightful work is an offring
on her srine and as sich all her wushippers are bound to hail it
Here is not a question of trumpry lords and honrabbles generals and
barronites but the crown itself and the king and queens actions
witch may be considered as the crown jewels Heres princes and
granddukes and airsparent and heaven knows what all with bloodroyal
in their veins and their names mentioned in the very fust page of the
peeridge In this book you become so intmate with the Prince of Wales
that you may follow him if you please to his marridgebed or if
you prefer the Princiss Charlotte you may have with her an hours
tatortator


 Our estimable correspondent means we presume teteateteO Y


Now though most of the remarkable extrax from this book have been given
already the cream of the Dairy as I wittily say I shall trouble
you nevertheless with a few partly because they cant be repeated
too often and because the toan of obsyvation with which they have been
genrally received by the press is not igsackly such as I think they
merit How indeed can these common magaseen and newspaper pipple know
anythink of fashnabble life let alone ryal

Conseaving then that the publication of the Dairy has done reel good
on this scoar and may probly do a deal moor I shall look through it
for the porpus of selecting the most ellygant passidges and which I
think may be peculiarly adapted to the readers benefick

For you see my dear Mr Yorke that in the fust place that this is
no common catchpny book like that of most authors and authoresses who
write for the base looker of gain Heaven bless you the Dairymaid is
above anything musnary She is a woman of rank and no mistake and is
as much above doin a common or vulgar action as I am superaor to taking
beer after dinner with my cheese She proves that most satisfackarily
as we see in the following passidge


Her royal highness came to me and having spoken a few phrases
on different subjects produced all the papers she wishes to have
published her whole correspondence with the prince relative to Lady
Js dismissal his subsequent neglect of the princess and finally
the acquittal of her supposed guilt signed by the Duke of Portland
c at the time of the secret inquiry when if proof could have
been brought against her it certainly would have been done and which
acquittal to the disgrace of all parties concerned as well as to the
justice of the nation in general was not made public at the time A
common criminal is publicly condemned or acquitted Her royal highness
commanded me to have these letters published forthwith saying You may
sell them for a great sum At first for she had spoken to me
before concerning this business I thought of availing myself of the
opportunity but upon second thoughts I turned from this idea with
detestation for if I do wrong by obeying her wishes and endeavoring
to serve her I will do so at least from good and disinterested motives
not from any sordid views The princess commands me and I will obey
her whatever may be the issue but not for fare or fee I own I
tremble not so much for myself as for the idea that she is not taking
the best and most dignified way of having these papers published Why
make a secret of it at all If wrong it should not be done if right
it should be done openly and in the face of her enemies In her royal
highnesss case as in that of wronged princes in general why do
they shrink from straightforward dealings and rather have recourse to
crooked policy I wish in this particular instance I could make
her royal highness feel thus but she is naturally indignant at being
falsely accused and will not condescend to an avowed explanation


Can anythink be more just and honrabble than this The Dairylady is
quite fair and abovebored A clear stage says she and no favior I
wont do behind my back what I am ashamed of before my face not I No
more she does for you see that though she was offered this manyscrip
by the princess FOR NOTHINK though she knew that she could actially get
for it a large sum of money she was above it like an honest noble
grateful fashnabble woman as she was She aboars secrecy and never
will have recors to disguise or crookid polacy This ought to be an
ansure to them RADICLE SNEERERS who pretend that they are the equals
of fashnabble pepple wheras its a wellknown fact that the vulgar
roagues have no notion of honor

And after this positif declaration which reflex honor on her ladyship
long life to her Ive often waited behind her chairafter this
positif declaration that even for the porpus of DEFENDING her
missis she was so himinded as to refuse anythink like a peculiarly
consideration it is actially asserted in the public prints by a
booxeller that he has given her A THOUSAND POUND for the Dairy A
thousand pound nonsinceits a phigment a base lible This woman
take a thousand pound in a matter where her dear mistriss friend and
benyfactriss was concerned Never A thousand baggonits would be more
prefrabble to a woman of her xqizzit feelins and fashion

But to proseed Its been objected to me when I wrote some of my
expearunces in fashnabble life that my languidge was occasionally
vulgar and not such as is genrally used in those exqizzit famlies which
I frequent Now Ill lay a wager that there is in this book wrote as
all the world knows by a rele lady and speakin of kings and queens
as if they were as common as sandboysthere is in this book more
wulgarity than ever I displayed more nastiness than ever I would dare
TO THINK ON and more bad grammar than ever I wrote since I was a boy at
school As for authografy evry genlmn has his own never mind spellin
I say so long as the sence is right

Let me here quot a letter from a corryspondent of this charming lady of
honor and a very nice corryspondent he is too without any mistake


Lady O poor Lady O knows the rules of prudence I fear me as
imperfectly as she doth those of the Greek and Latin Grammars or she
hath let her brother who is a sad swine become master of her secrets
and then contrived to quarrel with him You would see the outline of the
melange in the newspapers but not the report that Mr S is about to
publish a pamphlet as an addition to the Harleian Tracts setting forth
the amatory adventures of his sister We shall break our necks in haste
to buy it of course crying Shameful all the while and it is said
that Lady O is to be cut which I cannot entirely believe Let her
tell two or three old women about town that they are young and handsome
and give some welltimed parties and she may still keep the society
which she hath been used to The times are not so hard as they once
were when a woman could not construe Magna Charta with anything like
impunity People were full as gallant many years ago But the days are
gone by wherein my lordprotector of the commonwealth of England was
wont to go a lovemaking to Mrs Fleetwood with the Bible under his arm

And so Miss Jacky Gordon is really clothed with a husband at last and
Miss Laura Manners left without a mate She and Lord Stair should marry
and have children in mere revenge As to Miss Gordon shes a Venus well
suited for such a Vulcanwhom nothing but money and a title could
have rendered tolerable even to a kitchen wench It is said that the
matrimonial correspondence between this couple is to be published full
of sad scandalous relations of which you may be sure scarcely a word
is true In former times the Duchess of St As made use of these
elegant epistles in order to intimidate Lady Johnstone but that ruse
would not avail so in spite they are to be printed What a cargo
of amiable creatures Yet will some people scarcely believe in the
existence of Pandemonium

Tuesday MorningYou are perfectly right respecting the hot rooms
here which we all cry out against and all find very comfortablemuch
more so than the cold sands and bleak neighborhood of the sea which
looks vastly well in one of Vander Veldes pictures hung upon crimson
damask but hideous and shocking in reality H and his elle
talking of parties were last night at Cholmondeley House but seem
not to ripen in their love He is certainly goodhumored and I believe
goodhearted so deserves a good wife but his cara seems a genuine
London miss made up of many affectations Will she form a comfortable
helpmate For me I like not her origin and deem many strange things to
run in blood besides madness and the Hanoverian evil

ThursdayI verily do believe that I shall never get to the end of
this small sheet of paper so many unheard of interruptions have I had
and now I have been to Vauxhall and caught the toothache I was of Lady
E Bm and Hs party very dullthe Lady giving us all a supper
after our promenade


 Much ado was there God wot
 She would love but he would not


He ate a great deal of ice although he did not seem to require it and
she faisoit les yeux doux enough not only to have melted all the ice
which he swallowed but his own hard heart into the bargain The thing
will not do In the meantime Miss Long hath become quite cruel to
Wellesley Pole and divides her favor equally between Lords Killeen and
Kilworth two as simple Irishmen as ever gave birth to a bull I wish
to Hymen that she were fairly married for all this pother gives one a
disgusting picture of human nature


A disgusting pictur of human nature indeedand isnt he who moralizes
about it and she to whom he writes a couple of pretty heads in
the same piece Which Mr Yorke is the wust the scandle or the
scandlemongers See what it is to be a moral man of fashn Fust
he scrapes togither all the bad stoaries about all the people of
his acquentancehe goes to a ball and laffs or snears at everybody
therehe is asked to a dinner and brings away along with meat and
wine to his hearts content a sour stomick filled with nasty stories of
all the people present there He has such a squeamish appytite that all
the world seems to DISAGREE with him And what has he got to say to his
delicate female frend Why that

Fust Mr S is going to publish indescent stoaries about Lady O his
sister which everybodys goin to by

Nex That Miss Gordon is going to be cloathed with an usband and that
all their matrimonial corryspondins is to be published too

3 That Lord H is going to be married but theres some thing rong in
his wifes blood

4 Miss Long has cut Mr Wellesley and is gone after two Irish lords

Wooden you phancy now that the author of such a letter instead of
writin about pipple of tiptop qualaty was describin Vinegar Yard
Would you beleave that the lady he was aritin to was a chased modist
lady of honor and mother of a famly O trumpery O morris as Homer
says this is a higeous pictur of manners such as I weap to think of
as evry morl man must weap

The above is one pritty pictur of mearly fashnabble life what follows
is about families even higher situated than the most fashnabble Here
we have the princessregient her daughter the Princess Sharlot
her grandmamma the old quean and her madjistys daughters the two
princesses If this is not high life I dont know where it is to be
found and its pleasing to see what affeckshn and harmny rains in such
an exolted spear


Sunday 24thYesterday the princess went to meet the Princess
Charlotte at Kensington Lady  told me that when the latter
arrived she rushed up to her mother and said For Gods sake be
civil to her meaning the Duchess of Leeds who followed her Lady
 said she felt sorry for the latter but when the Princess of Wales
talked to her she soon became so free and easy that one could not
have any FEELING about her FEELINGS Princess Charlotte I was told was
looking handsome very pale but her head more becomingly dressedthat
is to say less dressed than usual Her figure is of that full round
shape which is now in its prime but she disfigures herself by wearing
her bodice so short that she literally has no waist Her feet are very
pretty and so are her hands and arms and her ears and the shape of
her head Her countenance is expressive when she allows her passions to
play upon it and I never saw any face with so little shade express so
many powerful and varied emotions Lady  told me that the Princess
Charlotte talked to her about her situation and said in a very
quiet but determined way she WOULD NOT BEAR IT and that as soon as
parliament met she intended to come to Warwick House and remain there
that she was also determined not to consider the Duchess of Leeds as
her GOVERNESS but only as her FIRST LADY She made many observations
on other persons and subjects and appears to be very quick very
penetrating but imperious and wilful There is a tone of romance too
in her character which will only serve to mislead her

She told her mother that there had been a great battle at Windsor
between the queen and the prince the former refusing to give up
Miss Knight from her own person to attend on Princess Charlotte as
subgoverness But the princeregent had gone to Windsor himself and
insisted on her doing so and the old Beguin was forced to submit
but has been ill ever since and Sir Henry Halford declared it was a
complete breaking up of her constitutionto the great delight of the
two princesses who were talking about this affair Miss Knight was the
very person they wished to have they think they can do as they like
with her It has been ordered that the Princess Charlotte should not see
her mother alone for a single moment but the latter went into her room
stuffed a pair of large shoes full of papers and having given them to
her daughter she went home Lady  told me everything was written
down and sent to Mr Brougham NEXT DAY


See what discord will creap even into the best regulated famlies Here
are six of emviz the quean and her two daughters her son and his
wife and daughter and the manner in which they hate one another is a
compleat puzzle

 his mother
 The Prince hates his wife
 his daughter

 Princess Charlotte hates her father

 Princess of Wales hates her husband

The old quean by their squobbles is on the pint of death and her two
jewtiful daughters are delighted at the news What a happy fashnabble
Christian famly O Mr Yorke Mr Yorke if this is the way in the
drawinrooms Im quite content to live below in pease and charaty with
all men writin as I am now in my pantry or els havin a quiet game at
cards in the servantsall With US theres no bitter wicked quarling
of this sort WE dont hate our children or bully our mothers or wish
em ded when theyre sick as this Dairywoman says kings and queens
do When were writing to our friends or sweethearts WE dont fill
our letters with nasty stoaries takin away the carricter of our
fellowservants as this maid of honors amusin moral frend does But
in coarse its not for us to judge of our bettersthese great people
are a supeerur race and we cant comprehend their ways

Do you recklectits twenty years ago nowhow a bewtiffle princess
died in givin buth to a poar baby and how the whole nation of Hengland
wep as though it was one man over that sweet woman and child in which
were sentered the hopes of every one of us and of which each was as
proud as of his own wife or infnt Do you recklect how pore fellows
spent their last shillin to buy a black crape for their hats and
clergymen cried in the pulpit and the whole country through was no
better than a great dismal funeral Do you recklet Mr Yorke who
was the person that we all took on so about We called her the Princis
Sharlot of Wales and we valyoud a single drop of her blood more than
the whole heartless body of her father Well we looked up to her as a
kind of saint or angle and blest God such foolish loyal English pipple
as we ware in those days who had sent this sweet lady to rule over us
But heaven bless you it was only souperstition She was no better than
she should be as it turns outor at least the Dairymaid says so No
betterif my daughters or yours was 12 so bad wed as leaf be dead
ourselves and they hanged But listen to this pritty charritable story
and a truce to reflexshuns


Sunday January 9 1814Yesterday according to appointment I went
to Princess Charlotte Found at Warwick House the harpplayer Dizzi
was asked to remain and listen to his performance but was talked to
during the whole time which completely prevented all possibility of
listening to the music The Duchess of Leeds and her daughter were in
the room but left it soon Next arrived Miss Knight who remained all
the time I was there Princess Charlotte was very graciousshowed me
all her bonny dyes as Bwould have called thempictures and cases
and jewels c She talked in a very desultory way and it would be
difficult to say of what She observed her mother was in very low
spirits I asked her how she supposed she could be otherwise This
QUESTIONING answer saves a great deal of trouble and serves two
purposesie avoids committing oneself or giving offence by silence
There was hung in the apartment one portrait amongst others that
very much resembled the Duke of D I asked Miss Knight whom it
represented She said that was not known it had been supposed a
likeness of the Pretender when young This answer suited my thoughts so
comically I could have laughed if one ever did at courts anything but
the contrary of what one was inclined to do

Princess Charlotte has a very great variety of expression in her
countenancea play of features and a force of muscle rarely seen in
connection with such soft and shadeless coloring Her hands and arms
are beautiful but I think her figure is already gone and will soon be
precisely like her mothers in short it is the very picture of her and
NOT IN MINIATURE I could not help analyzing my own sensations during
the time I was with her and thought more of them than I did of her Why
was I at all flattered at all more amused at all more supple to this
young princess than to her who is only the same sort of person set
in the shade of circumstances and of years It is that youth and the
approach of power and the latent views of selfinterest sway the heart
and dazzle the understanding If this is so with a heart not I trust
corrupt and a head not particularly formed for interested calculations
what effect must not the same causes produce on the generality of
mankind

In the course of the conversation the Princess Charlotte contrived to
edge in a good deal of tumdedy and would if I had entered into
the thing have gone on with it while looking at a little picture of
herself which had about thirty or forty different dresses to put over
it done on isinglass and which allowed the general coloring of the
picture to be seen through its transparency It was I thought a pretty
enough conceit though rather like dressing up a doll Ah said Miss
Knight I am not content though madamefor I yet should have liked
one more dressthat of the favorite Sultana

No no said the princess I never was a favorite and never can be
onelooking at a picture which she said was her fathers but which
I do not believe was done for the regent any more than for me but
represented a young man in a hussars dressprobably a former favorite

The Princess Charlotte seemed much hurt at the little notice that was
taken of her birthday After keeping me for two hours and a half she
dismissed me and I am sure I could not say what she said except that
it was an olio of decousus and heterogeneous things partaking of the
characteristics of her mother grafted on a younger scion I dined
teteatete with my dear old aunt hers is always a sweet and soothing
society to me


Theres a pleasing ladylike moral extract for you An innocent young
thing of fifteen has picturs of TWO lovers in her room and expex a
good number more This dellygate young creature EDGES in a good deal of
TUMDEDY I cant find it in Johnsons Dixonary and would have GONE ON
WITH THE THING ellygence of languidge if the dairylady would have
let her

Now to tell you the truth Mr Yorke I doant beleave a single
syllible of this story This lady of honner says in the fust place
that the princess would have talked a good deal of TUMDEDY which means
I suppose indeasnsy if she the lady of honner WOULD HAVE LET HER
This IS a good one Why she lets every body else talk tumdedy to their
hearts content she lets her friends WRITE tumdedy and after keeping
it for a quarter of a sentry she PRINTS it Why then be so squeamish
about HEARING a little And then theres the stoary of the two
portricks This woman has the honner to be received in the frendlyest
manner by a British princess and what does the grateful loyal creature
do 2 picturs of the princesss relations are hanging in her room and
the Dairywoman swears away the poor young princesss carrickter by
swearing they are picturs of her LOVERS For shame oh for shame you
slanderin backbitin dairywoman you If you told all them things to
your dear old aunt on going to dine with her you must have had very
sweet and soothing society indeed

I had marked out many more extrax which I intended to write about but
I think I have said enough about this Dairy in fack the butler and
the gals in the servantshall are not well pleased that I should go
on reading this naughty book so well have no more of it only one
passidge about Pollytics witch is sertnly quite new


No one was so likely to be able to defeat Bonaparte as the Crown
Prince from the intimate knowledge he possessed of his character
Bernadotte was also instigated against Bonaparte by one who not only
owed him a personal hatred but who possessed a mind equal to his and
who gave the Crown Prince both information and advice how to act This
was no less a person than Madame de Stael It was not as some have
asserted THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH BERNADOTTE for at the time of
their intimacy MADAME DE STAEL WAS IN LOVE WITH ROCCA But she used her
influence which was not small with the Crown Prince to make him
fight against Bonaparte and to her wisdom may be attributed much of the
success which accompanied his attack upon him Bernadotte has raised the
flame of liberty which seems fortunately to blaze all around May it
liberate Europe and from the ashes of the laurel may olive branches
spring up and overshadow the earth


Theres a discuvery that the overthrow of Boneypart is owing to MADAME
DE STAEL What nonsince for Colonel Southey or Doctor Napier to write
histories of the war with that Capsican hupstart and murderer when here
we have the whole affair explaned by the lady of honor


Sunday April 10 1814The incidents which take place every hour are
miraculous Bonaparte is deposed but alive subdued but allowed to
choose his place of residence The island of Elba is the spot he has
selected for his ignominious retreat France is holding forth repentant
arms to her banished sovereign The Poissardes who dragged Louis XVI
to the scaffold are presenting flowers to the Emperor of Russia
the restorer of their legitimate king What a stupendous field for
philosophy to expatiate in What an endless material for thought What
humiliation to the pride of mere human greatness How are the mighty
fallen Of all that was great in Napoleon what remains Despoiled
of his usurped power he sinks to insignificance There was no
moral greatness in the man The meteor dazzled scorched is put
oututterly and for ever But the power which rests in those who have
delivered the nations from bondage is a power that is delegated to them
from heaven and the manner in which they have used it is a guarantee
for its continuance The Duke of Wellington has gained laurels unstained
by any useless flow of blood He has done more than conquer othershe
has conquered himself and in the midst of the blaze and flush of
victory surrounded by the homage of nations he has not been betrayed
into the commission of any act of cruelty or wanton offence He was as
cool and selfpossessed under the blaze and dazzle of fame as a common
man would be under the shade of his gardentree or by the hearth of his
home But the tyrant who kept Europe in awe is now a pitiable object for
scorn to point the finger of derision at and humanity shudders as it
remembers the scourge with which this mans ambition was permitted to
devastate every home tie and every heartfelt joy


And now after this sublime passidge as full of awfle reflections and
pious sentyments as those of Mrs Cole in the play I shall only quot
one little extrak more


All goes gloomily with the poor princess Lady Charlotte Campbell told
me she regrets not seeing all these curious personages but she says
the more the princess is forsaken the more happy she is at having
offered to attend her at this time THIS IS VERY AMIABLE IN HER and
cannot fail to be gratifying to the princess


So it iswery amiable wery kind and considerate in her indeed Poor
Princess how lucky you was to find a frend who loved you for your own
sake and when all the rest of the wuld turned its back kep steady to
you As for believing that Lady Sharlot had any hand in this book
heaven forbid she is all gratitude pure gratitude depend upon it SHE
would not go for to blacken her old frend and patrons carrickter after
having been so outrageously faithful to her SHE wouldnt do it at no
price depend upon it How sorry she must be that others ant quite
so squemish and show up in this indesent way the follies of her kind
genrus foolish bennyfactris


 The authorized announcement in the John Bull newspaper sets this
question at rest It is declared that her ladyship is not the writer of
the DiaryO Y

MAYFAIR Nov 30 1839 Midnite

HONRABBLE BARNETRetired from the littery world a year or moar I
didnt think anythink would injuice me to come forrards again for I
was content with my share of reputation and propoasd to add nothink to
those immortial wux which have rendered this Magaseen so sallybrated

Shall I tell you the reazn of my reappearantsa desire for the
benefick of my fellowcreatures Fiddlestick A mighty truth with which
my busm labored and which I must bring forth or die Nonsincestuff
moneys the secret my dear Barnetmoneylargong gelt spicunia
Heres quarterday coming and Im blest if I can pay my landlud unless
I can ad hartificially to my inkum

This is however betwigst you and me Theres no need to blacard the
streets with it or to tell the British public that Fitzroy Yllwplsh
is short of money or that the sallybrated hauthor of the Y Papers is
in peskewniary difficklties or is fiteagued by his superhuman littery
labors or by his famly suckmstansies or by any other pusnal matter
my maxim dear B is on these pints to be as quiet as posbile What
the juice does the public care for you or me Why must we always in
prefizzes and what not be atalking about ourselves and our igstrodnary
merrats woas and injaries It is on this subjick that I porpies my
dear Barnet to speak to you in a frendly way and praps youll find my
advise tolrabbly holesum

Well thenif you care about the apinions fur good or evil of us
poor suvvants I tell you in the most candied way I like you Barnet
Ive had my fling at you in my day for entry nou that last stoary I
roat about you and Larnder was as big a bownsir as ever wasIve had
my fling at you but I like you One may objeck to an immense deal of
your writings which betwigst you and me contain more sham scentiment
sham morallaty sham poatry than youd like to own but in spite of
this theres the STUFF in you youve a kind and loyal heart in you
Barneta trifle deboshed perhaps a kean i igspecially for whats
comic as for your tradgady its mighty flatchulent and a ready
plesnt pen The man who says you are an As is an As himself Dont
believe him Barnet not that I suppose you wilfor if Ive formed
a correck apinion of you from your wucks you think your smallbeear as
good as most mens every man doesand why not We brew and we love
our own tapamen but the pint betwigst us is this stewpid absudd way
of crying out because the public dont like it too Why shood they
my dear Barnet You may vow that they are fools or that the critix are
your enemies or that the wuld should judge your poams by your critticle
rules and not their own you may beat your breast and vow you are a
marter and you wont mend the matter Take heart man youre not so
misrabble after all your spirits need not be so VERY cast down you are
not so VERY badly paid Id lay a wager that you make with one thing
or anotherplays novvles pamphlicks and little odd jobbs here and
thereyour three thowsnd a year Theres many a man dear Bullwig that
works for less and lives content Why shouldnt you Three thowsnd a
year is no such bad thinglet alone the barnetcy it must be a great
comfort to have that bloody hand in your skitching

But dont you sea that in a wuld naturally envius wickid and fond
of a joak this very barnetcy these very cumplaintsthis ceaseless
groning and moning and wining of yours is igsackly the thing which
makes people laff and snear more If you were ever at a great school
you must recklect who was the boy most bullid and buffited and
purshewdhe who minded it most He who could take a basting got but
few he who rord and wep because the knotty boys called him nicknames
was nicknamed wuss and wuss I recklect there was at our school in
Smithfield a chap of this milksop spoony sort who appeared among the
romping ragged fellers in a fine flanning dressinggownd that his mama
had given him That pore boy was beaten in a way that his dear ma and
aunts didnt know him his fine flanning dressinggownd was torn all to
ribbings and he got no pease in the school ever after but was abliged
to be taken to some other saminary where I make no doubt he was paid
off igsactly in the same way

Do you take the halligory my dear Barnet Mutayto nominyyou know what
I mean You are the boy and your barnetcy is the dressinggownd You
dress yourself out finer than other chaps and they all begin to sault
and hustle you its human nature Barnet You show weakness think
of your dear ma mayhap and begin to cry its all over with you
the whole school is at youupper boys and under big and little the
dirtiest little fag in the place will pipe out blaggerd names at you
and takes his pewny tug at your tail

The only way to avoid such consperracies is to put a pair of stowt
shoalders forrards and bust through the crowd of raggymuffins A good
bold fellow dubls his fistt and cries Wha dares meddle wi me When
Scott got HIS barnetcy for instans did any one of us cry out No by
the laws he was our master and wo betide the chap that said neigh to
him But theres barnets and barnets Do you recklect that fine chapter
in Squintin Durward about the too fellos and cups at the siege of
the bishops castle One of them was a brave warner and kep HIS cup
they strangled the other chapstrangled him and laffed at him too

With respeck then to the barnetcy pint this is my advice brazen it
out Us littery men I take to be like a pack of schoolboyschildish
greedy envius holding by our friends and always ready to fight What
must be a mans conduck among such He must either take no notis and
pass on myjastick or else turn round and pummle soundlyone two
right and left ding dong over the face and eyes above all never
acknowledge that he is hurt Years ago for instans weve no illblood
but only mention this by way of igsample you began a sparring with
this Magaseen Law bless you such a ridicklus gaym I never see a man
so belaybord beflustered bewolloped was never known it was the laff
of the whole town Your intelackshal natur respected Barnet is not
fizzickly adapted so to speak for encounters of this sort You must
not indulge in combats with us course bullies of the press you have not
the STAMINY for a reglar setto What then is your plan In the midst
of the mob to pass as quiet as you can you wont be undistubbed Who
is Some stray kix and buffits will fall to youmortial man is subjick
to such but if you begin to wins and cry out and set up for a marter
wo betide you

These remarks pusnal as I confess them to be are yet I assure you
written in perfick goodnatur and have been inspired by your play of
the Sea Capting and prefiz to it which latter is on matters intirely
pusnal and will therefore I trust igscuse this kind of ad hominam
as they say diskcushion I propose honrabble Barnit to cumsider
calmly this play and prephiz and to speak of both with that honisty
which in the pantry or studdy Ive been always phamous for Let us
in the first place listen to the opening of the Preface of the Fourth
Edition


No one can be more sensible than I am of the many faults and
deficiencies to be found in this play but perhaps when it is
considered how very rarely it has happened in the history of our
dramatic literature that good acting plays have been produced except by
those who have either been actors themselves or formed their habits of
literature almost of life behind the scenes I might have looked for
a criticism more generous and less exacting and rigorous than that
by which the attempts of an author accustomed to another class of
composition have been received by a large proportion of the periodical
press

It is scarcely possible indeed that this play should not contain
faults of two kinds first the faults of one who has necessarily much
to learn in the mechanism of his art and secondly of one who having
written largely in the narrative style of fiction may not unfrequently
mistake the effects of a novel for the effects of a drama I may add to
these perhaps the deficiencies that arise from uncertain health and
broken spirits which render the author more susceptible than he might
have been some years since to that spirit of depreciation and hostility
which it has been his misfortune to excite amongst the general
contributors to the periodical press for the consciousness that every
endeavor will be made to cavil to distort to misrepresent and in
fine if possible to RUN DOWN will occasionally haunt even the hours
of composition to check the inspiration and damp the ardor

Having confessed thus much frankly and fairly and with a hope that
I may ultimately do better should I continue to write for the stage
which nothing but an assurance that with all my defects I may yet
bring some little aid to the drama at a time when any aid however
humble ought to be welcome to the lovers of the art could induce me to
do may I be permitted to say a few words as to some of the objections
which have been made against this play


Now my dear sir look what a pretty number of please you put forrards
here why your play shouldnt be good

First Good plays are almost always written by actors

Secknd You are a novice to the style of composition

Third You MAY be mistaken in your effects being a novelist by trade
and not a playwriter

Fourthly Your in such bad helth and sperrits

Fifthly Your so afraid of the critix that they damp your arder

For shame for shame man What confeshns is thesewhat painful
pewling and piping Your not a babby I take you to be some seven or
eight and thutty years oldin the morning of youth as the flosofer
says Dont let any such nonsince take your reazn prisoner What
you an old hand amongst usan old soljer of our sovring quean the
pressyou who have had the best pay have held the topmost rank ay
and DESERVED them tooI gif you lef to quot me in sasiaty and say I
AM a man of genius Yllwplsh says soyou to lose heart and cry
pickavy and begin to howl because little boys fling stones at you
Fie man take courage and bearing the terrows of your bloodred hand
as the poet says punish us if weve ofended you punish us like a man
or bear your own punishment like a man Dont try to come off with such
misrabble lodgic as that above

What do you You give four satisfackary reazns that the play is bad the
secknd is naughtfor your no such chicking at playwriting this being
the forth You show that the play must be bad and THEN begin to deal
with the critix for finding folt

Was there ever wuss generalship The play IS badyour righta wuss I
never see or read But why kneed YOU say so If it was so VERY bad why
publish it BECAUSE YOU WISH TO SERVE THE DRAMA O fie dont lay that
flattering function to your sole as Milton observes Do you believe
that this Sea Capting can serve the drama Did you never intend that
it should serve anything or anybody ELSE Of cors you did You wrote it
for moneymoney from the maniger money from the booksellerfor the
same reason that I write this Sir Shakspeare wrote for the very same
reasons and I never heard that he bragged about serving the drama Away
with this canting about great motifs Let us not be too prowd my dear
Barnet and fansy ourselves marters of the truth marters or apostels
We are but tradesmen working for bread and not for righteousness
sake Lets try and work honestly but dont let us be prayting pompisly
about our sacred calling The taylor who makes your coats and very
well they are made too with the best of velvit collarsI say Stulze
or Nugee might cry out that THEIR motifs were but to assert the eturnle
truth of tayloring with just as much reazn and who would believe them

Well after this acknollitchmint that the play is bad come sefral pages
of attack on the critix and the folt those gentry have found with it
With these I shant middle for the presnt You defend all the characters
1 by 1 and conclude your remarks as follows


I must be pardoned for this disquisition on my own designs When every
means is employed to misrepresent it becomes perhaps allowable to
explain And if I do not think that my faults as a dramatic author are
to be found in the study and delineation of character it is precisely
because THAT is the point on which all my previous pursuits in
literature and actual life would be most likely to preserve me from the
errors I own elsewhere whether of misjudgment or inexperience

I have now only to add my thanks to the actors for the zeal and talent
with which they have embodied the characters entrusted to them The
sweetness and grace with which Miss Faucit embellished the part of
Violet which though only a sketch is most necessary to the coloring
and harmony of the play were perhaps the more pleasing to the audience
from the generosity rare with actors which induced her to take a
part so far inferior to her powers The applause which attends the
performance of Mrs Warner and Mr Strickland attests their success
in characters of unusual difficulty while the singular beauty and
nobleness whether of conception or execution with which the greatest
of living actors has elevated the part of Norman so totally different
from his ordinary range of character is a new proof of his versatility
and accomplishment in all that belongs to his art It would be scarcely
gracious to conclude these remarks without expressing my acknowledgment
of that generous and indulgent sense of justice which forgetting all
political differences in a literary arena has enabled me to appeal to
approving audiencesfrom hostile critics And it is this which alone
encourages me to hope that sooner or later I may add to the dramatic
literature of my country something that may find perhaps almost as
many friends in the next age as it has been the fate of the author to
find enemies in this


See now what a good comfrabble vanaty is Pepple have quarld with the
dramatic characters of your play No says you if I AM remarkabble
for anythink its for my study and delineation of character THAT is
presizely the pint to which my littery purshuits have led me Have you
read Jil Blaw my dear sir Have you pirouzed that exlent tragady the
Critic Theres something so like this in Sir Fretful Plaguy and the
Archbishop of Granadiers that Im blest if I cant laff till my sides
ake Think of the critix fixing on the very pint for which you are
famusthe roags And spose they had said the plot was absudd or the
langwitch absudder still dont you think you would have had a word in
defens of them tooyou who hope to find frends for your dramatic wux
in the nex age Poo I tell thee Barnet that the nex age will be
wiser and better than this and do you think that it will imply itself a
reading of your trajadies This is misantrofy Barnetreglar Byronism
and you ot to have a better apinian of human natur

Your apinion about the actors I shant here meddle with They all acted
exlently as far as my humbile judgement goes and your write in giving
them all possible prays But lets consider the last sentence of the
prefiz my dear Barnet and see what a pretty set of apiniuns you lay
down

1 The critix are your inymies in this age

2 In the nex however you hope to find newmrous frends

3 And its a satisfackshn to think that in spite of politticle
diffrances you have found frendly aujences here

Now my dear Barnet for a man who begins so humbly with what my friend
Father Prout calls an argamantum ad misericorjam who ignowledges that
his play is bad that his pore dear helth is bad and those cussid
critix have played the juice with himI say for a man who beginns in
such a humbill toan its rather RICH to see how you end

My dear Barnet DO you suppose that POLITTICLE DIFFRANCES prejudice
pepple against YOU What ARE your politix Wig I presumeso are mine
ontry noo And what if they ARE Wig or Raddiccle or Cumsuvvative Does
any mortial man in England care a phig for your politix Do you think
yourself such a mity man in parlymint that critix are to be angry with
you and aujences to be cumsidered magnanamous because they treat you
fairly There now was Sherridn he who roat the Rifles and School
for Scandle I saw the Rifles after your play and O Barnet if
you KNEW what a relief it wasthere I say was Sherridnhe WAS a
politticle character if you pleasehe COULD make a spitch or twodo
you spose that Pitt Purseyvall Castlerag old George the Third
himself wooden go to see the Rivlesay and clap hands too and
laff and ror for all Sherrys Wiggery Do you spose the critix wouldnt
applaud too For shame Barnet what ninnis what hartless raskles you
must beleave them to bein the fust plase to fancy that you are a
politticle genus in the secknd to let your politix interfear with
their notiums about littery merits

Put that nonsince out of your head as Fox said to Bonypart Wasnt
it that great genus Dennis that wrote in Swiff and Poops time
who fansid that the French king wooden make pease unless Dennis
was delivered up to him Upon my wud I doant think he carrid
his diddlusion much further than a serting honrabble barnet of my
aquentance

And then for the nex age Respected sir this is another diddlusion
a gross misteak on your part or my name is not Ysh These plays
immortial Ah parrysampe as the French say this is too strongthe

year the barl will be off the stox altogether never never to return

Ive notted down a few frazes here and there which you will do well do
igsamin


 NORMAN

 The eternal Flora
 Woos to her odorous haunts the western wind
 While circling round and upwards from the boughs
 Golden with fruits that lure the joyous birds
 Melody like a happy soul released
 Hangs in the air and from invisible plumes
 Shakes sweetness down


 NORMAN

 And these the lips
 Where till this hour the sad and holy kiss
 Of parting lingerd as the fragrance left
 By ANGELS when they touch the earth and vanish


 NORMAN

 Hark she has blessed her son I bid ye witness
 Ye listening heavensthou circumambient air
 The ocean sighs it backand with the murmur
 Rustle the happy leaves All nature breathes
 Aloudaloftto the Great Parents ear
 The blessing of the mother on her child


 NORMAN

 I dream of love enduring faith a heart
 Mingled with minea deathless heritage
 Which I can take unsullied to the STARS
 When the Great Father calls his children home


 NORMAN

 The blue air breathless in the STARRY peace
 After long silence hushed as heaven but filled
 With happy thoughts as heaven with ANGELS


 NORMAN

 Till one calm night when over earth and wave
 Heaven looked its love from all its numberless STARS


 NORMAN

 Those eyes the guiding STARS by which I steered


 NORMAN

 That great mother
 The only parent I have known whose face
 Is bright with gazing ever on the STARS
 The mothersea


 NORMAN

 My bark shall be our home
 The STARS that light the ANGEL palaces
 Of air our lamps


 NORMAN

 A name that glitters like a STAR amidst
 The galaxy of Englands loftiest born


 LADY ARUNDEL

 And see him princeliest of the lion tribe
 Whose swords and coronals gleam around the throne
 The guardian STARS of the imperial isle


The fust spissymen has been going the round of all the papers as real
reglar poatry Those wickid critix they must have been laffing in their
sleafs when they quoted it Malody suckling round and uppards from the
bows like a happy soul released hangs in the air and from invizable
plumes shakes sweetness down Mighty fine truly but let mortial man
tell the meannink of the passidge Is it MUSICKLE sweetniss that Malody
shakes down from its plumesits wings that is or tailor some
pekewliar scent that proceeds from happy souls released and which they
shake down from the trees when they are suckling round and uppards IS
this poatry Barnet Lay your hand on your busm and speak out boldly
Is it poatry or sheer windy humbugg that sounds a little melojous and
wont bear the commanest test of comman sence

In passidge number 2 the same bisniss is going on though in a more
comprehensable way the air the leaves the otion are fild with
emocean at Capting Normans happiness Pore Nature is dragged in to
partisapate in his joys just as she has been befor Once in a poem
this universle simfithy is very well but once is enuff my dear Barnet
and that once should be in some great suckmstans surelysuch as the
meeting of Adam and Eve in Paradice Lost or Jewpeter and Jewno in
Hoamer where there seems as it were a reasn for it But seacaptings
should not be eternly spowting and invoking gods hevns starrs angels
and other silestial influences We can all do it Barnet nothing in
life is esier I can compare my livry buttons to the stars or the
clouds of my backopipe to the dark vollums that ishew from Mount Hetna
or I can say that angels are looking down from them and the tobacco
silf like a happy sole released is circling round and upwards and
shaking sweetness down All this is as esy as drink but its not
poatry Barnet nor natural People when their mothers reckonize them
dont howl about the suckumambient air and paws to think of the happy
leaves arustlingat least one mistrusts them if they do Take
another instans out of your own play Capting Norman with his eternil
SLACKJAW meets the gal of his art


 Look up look up my Violetweeping fie
 And trembling tooyet leaning on my breast
 In truth thou art too soft for such rude shelter
 Look up I come to woo thee to the seas
 My sailors bride Hast thou no voice but blushes
 NayFrom those roses let me like the bee
 Drag forth the secret sweetness


 VIOLET

 Oh what thoughts
 Were kept for SPEECH when we once more should meet
 Now blotted from the PAGE and all I feel
 IsTHOU art with me


Very right Miss Violetthe scentiment is natral affeckshnit
pleasing simple it might have been in more grammaticle languidge and
no harm done but never mind the feeling is pritty and I can fancy
my dear Barnet a pritty smiling weeping lass looking up in a mans
face and saying it But the captingoh this captingthis windy
spouting captain with his prittinesses and conseated apollogies for
the hardness of his busm and his old stale vapid simalies and his
wishes to be a bee Pish Men dont make love in this finniking
way Its the part of a sentymentle poeticle taylor not a galliant
gentleman in command of one of her Madjistys vessels of war

Look at the remaining extrac honored Barnet and acknollidge that
Capting Norman is eturnly repeating himself with his endless jabber
about stars and angels Look at the neat grammaticle twist of Lady
Arundels spitch too who in the corse of three lines has made her
son a prince a lion with a sword and coronal and a star Why jumble
and sheak up metafors in this way Barnet one simily is quite enuff in
the best of sentenses and I preshume I kneednt tell you that its as
well to have it LIKE when you are about it Take my advise honrabble
sirlisten to a humble footmin its genrally best in poatry to
understand puffickly what you mean yourself and to ingspress your
meaning clearly afterwoodsin the simpler words the better praps You
may for instans call a coronet a coronal an ancestral coronal p
74 if you like as you might call a hat a swart sombrero a glossy
fourandnine a silken helm to storm impermeable and lightsome as
the breezy gossamer but in the long run its as well to call it
a hat It IS a hat and that name is quite as poetticle as another I
think its Playto or els Harrystottle who observes that what we call a
rose by any other name would smell as sweet Confess now dear Barnet
dont you long to call it a Polyanthus

I never see a play more carelessly written In such a hurry you seem to
have bean that you have actially in some sentences forgot to put in the
sence What is this for instance


 This thrice precious one
 Smiled to my eyesdrew being from my breast
 Slept in my armsthe very tears I shed
 Above my treasures were to men and angels
 Alike such holy sweetness


In the name of all the angels that ever you invokedRaphael Gabriel
Uriel Zadkiel Azraelwhat does this holy sweetness mean Were not
spinxes to read such durk conandrums If you knew my state sins I came
upon this passidgIve neither slep nor eton Ive neglected my pantry
Ive been wandring from house to house with this riddl in my hand and
nobody can understand it All Mr Fraziers men are wild looking gloomy
at one another and asking what this may be All the cumtributors have
been spoak to The Doctor who knows every languitch has tried and
givn up weve sent to Docteur Pettigruel who reads horyglifics a
deal ezier than my way of spellinno anser Quick quick with a
fifth edition honored Barnet and set us at rest While your about it
please too to igsplain the two last lines


 His merry bark with Englands flag to crown her


See what dellexy of igspreshn a flag to crown her


 His merry bark with Englands flag to crown her
 Fame for my hopes and woman in my cares


Likewise the following


 Girl beware
 THE LOVE THAT TRIFLES ROUND THE CHARMS IT GILDS
 OFT RUINS WHILE IT SHINES


Igsplane this men and angels Ive tried every way backards forards
and in all sorts of trancepositions as thus


 The love that ruins round the charms it shines
 Gilds while it trifles oft

Or

 The charm that gilds around the love it ruins
 Oft trifles while it shines

Or

 The ruins that love gilds and shines around
 Oft trifles where it charms

Or

 Love while it charms shines round and ruins oft
 The trifles that it gilds

Or

 The love that trifles gilds and ruins oft
 While round the charms it shines


All which are as sensable as the fust passidge

And with this Ill alow my friend Smith who has been silent all this
time to say a few words He has not written near so much as me being
an infearor genus betwigst ourselves but he says he never had such
mortial difficklty with anything as with the dixcripshn of the plott of
your pease Here his letter


To CHRLS FTZRY PLNTGNT YLLWPLSH ESQ c c

30th Nov 1839

MY DEAR AND HONORED SIRI have the pleasure of laying before you the
following description of the plot and a few remarks upon the style of
the piece called The Sea Captain

Fiveandtwenty years back a certain Lord Arundel had a daughter
heiress of his estates and property a poor cousin Sir Maurice Beevor
being next in succession and a page Arthur Le Mesnil by name

The daughter took a fancy for the page and the young persons were
married unknown to his lordship

Three days before her confinement thinking no doubt that period
favorable for travelling the young couple had agreed to run away
together and had reached a chapel near on the seacoast from which
they were to embark when Lord Arundel abruptly put a stop to their
proceedings by causing one Gaussen a pirate to murder the page

His daughter was carried back to Arundel House and in three days gave
birth to a son Whether his lordship knew of this birth I cannot say
the infant however was never acknowledged but carried by Sir Maurice
Beevor to a priest Onslow by name who educated the lad and kept him
for twelve years in profound ignorance of his birth The boy went by the
name of Norman

Lady Arundel meanwhile married again again became a widow but had a
second son who was the acknowledged heir and called Lord Ashdale Old
Lord Arundel died and her ladyship became countess in her own right

When Norman was about twelve years of age his mother who wished to
WAFT young Arthur to a distant land had him sent on board ship Who
should the captain of the ship be but Gaussen who received a smart
bribe from Sir Maurice Beevor to kill the lad Accordingly Gaussen tied
him to a plank and pitched him overboard

      

About thirteen years after these circumstances Violet an orphan niece
of Lady Arundels second husband came to pass a few weeks with her
ladyship She had just come from a seavoyage and had been saved from a
wicked Algerine by an English sea captain This sea captain was no other
than Norman who had been picked up off his plank and fell in love
with and was loved by Miss Violet

A short time after Violets arrival at her aunts the captain came to
pay her a visit his ship anchoring off the coast near Lady Arundels
residence By a singular coincidence that rogue Gaussens ship anchored
in the harbor too Gaussen at once knew his man for he had tracked
him after drowning him and he informed Sir Maurice Beevor that young
Norman was alive

Sir Maurice Beevor informed her ladyship How should she get rid of him
In this wise He was in love with Violet let him marry her and be off
for Lord Ashdale was in love with his cousin too and of course could
not marry a young woman in her station of life You have a chaplain on
board says her ladyship to Captain Norman let him attend tonight
in the ruined chapel marry Violet and away with you to sea By this
means she hoped to be quit of him forever

But unfortunately the conversation had been overheard by Beevor and
reported to Ashdale Ashdale determined to be at the chapel and carry
off Violet as for Beevor he sent Gaussen to the chapel to kill both
Ashdale and Norman thus there would only be Lady Arundel between him
and the title

Norman in the meanwhile who had been walking near the chapel had just
seen his worthy old friend the priest most barbarously murdered there
Sir Maurice Beevor had set Gaussen upon him his reverence was coming
with the papers concerning Normans birth which Beevor wanted in order
to extort money from the countess Gaussen was however obliged to run
before he got the papers and the clergyman had time before he died
to tell Norman the story and give him the documents with which Norman
sped off to the castle to have an interview with his mother

He lays his white cloak and hat on the table and begs to be left alone
with her ladyship Lord Ashdale who is in the room surlily quits it
but going out cunningly puts on Normans cloak It will be dark
says he down at the chapel Violet wont know me and egad Ill run
off with her

Norman has his interview Her ladyship acknowledges him for she cannot
help it but will not embrace him love him or have anything to do with
him

Away he goes to the chapel His chaplain was there waiting to marry him
to Violet his boat was there to carry him on board his ship and Violet
was there too

Norman says she in the dark dear Norman I knew you by your white
cloak here I am And she and the man in a cloak go off to the inner
chapel to be married

There waits Master Gaussen he has seized the chaplain and the boats
crew and is just about to murder the man in the cloak when

NORMAN rushes in and cuts him down much to the surprise of Miss for
she never suspected it was sly Ashdale who had come as we have seen
disguised and very nearly paid for his masquerading

Ashdale is very grateful but when Norman persists in marrying Violet
he saysno he shant He shall fight he is a coward if he doesnt
fight Norman flings down his sword and says he WONT fight and

Lady Arundel who has been at prayers all this time rushing in says
Hold this is your brother Percyyour elder brother Here is some
restiveness on Ashdales part but he finishes by embracing his brother

Norman burns all the papers vows he will never peach reconciles
himself with his mother says he will go loser but having ordered his
ship to veer round to the chapel orders it to veer back again for he
will pass the honeymoon at Arundel Castle

As you have been pleased to ask my opinion it strikes me that there are
one or two very good notions in this plot But the author does not fail
as he would modestly have us believe from ignorance of stagebusiness
he seems to know too much rather than too little about the stage to
be too anxious to cram in effects incidents perplexities There is
the perplexity concerning Ashdales murder and Normans murder and the
priests murder and the pages murder and Gaussens murder There is
the perplexity about the papers and that about the hat and cloak a
silly foolish obstacle which only tantalize the spectator and retard
the march of the dramas action it is as if the author had said
I must have a new incident in every act I must keep tickling the
spectator perpetually and never let him off until the fall of the
curtain

The same disagreeable bustle and petty complication of intrigue you may
remark in the authors drama of Richelieu The Lady of Lyons was a
much simpler and better wrought plot the incidents following each other
either not too swiftly or startlingly In Richelieu it always seemed
to me as if one heard doors perpetually clapping and banging one
was puzzled to follow the train of conversation in the midst of the
perpetual small noises that distracted one right and left

Nor is the list of characters of The Sea Captain to be despised The
outlines of all of them are good A mother for whom one feels a proper
tragic mixture of hatred and pity a gallant singlehearted son whom
she disdains and who conquers her at last by his noble conduct a
dashing haughty Tybalt of a brother a wicked poor cousin a pretty
maid and a fierce buccaneer These people might pass three hours very
well on the stage and interest the audience hugely but the author
fails in filling up the outlines His language is absurdly stilted
frequently careless the reader or spectator hears a number of loud
speeches but scarce a dozen lines that seem to belong of nature to the
speakers

Nothing can be more fulsome or loathsome to my mind than the continual
shamreligious claptraps which the author has put into the mouth of
his hero nothing more unsailorlike than his nambypamby starlit
descriptions which my ingenious colleague has I see alluded to Thy
faith my anchor and thine eyes my haven cries the gallant captain to
his lady See how loosely the sentence is constructed like a thousand
others in the book The captain is to cast anchor with the girls faith
in her own eyes either image might pass by itself but together like
the quadrupeds of Kilkenny they devour each other The captain tells
his lieutenant to BID HIS BARK VEER ROUND to a point in the harbor Was
ever such language My lady gives Sir Maurice a thousand pounds to WAFT
him her son to some distant shore Nonsense sheer nonsense and what
is worse affected nonsense

Look at the comedy of the poor cousin There is a great deal of game on
the estatepartridges hares wildgeese snipes and plovers SMACKING
HIS LIPSbesides a magnificent preserve of sparrows which I can sell
TO THE LITTLE BLACKGUARDS in the streets at a penny a hundred But I am
very poora very poor old knight

Is this wit or nature It is a kind of sham wit it reads as if it were
wit but it is not What poor poor stuff about the little blackguard
boys what flimsy ecstasies and silly smacking of lips about the
plovers Is this the man who writes for the next age O fie Here is
another joke


 Sir Maurice Mice zounds how can I
 Keep mice I cant afford it They were starved
 To death an age ago The last was found
 Come Christmas three years stretched beside a bone
 In that same larder so consumed and worn
 By pious fast twas awful to behold it
 I canonized its corpse in spirits of wine
 And set it in the porcha solemn warning
 To thieves and beggars


Is not this rare wit Zounds how can I keep mice is well enough for
a miser not too new or brilliant either but this miserable dilution
of a thin joke this wretched hunting down of the poor mouse It is
humiliating to think of a man of esprit harping so long on such a mean
pitiful string A man who aspires to immortality too I doubt whether
it is to be gained thus whether our authors words are not too loosely
built to make starry pointing pyramids of Horace clipped and squared
his blocks more carefully before he laid the monument which imber edax
or aquila impotens or fuga temporum might assail in vain Even old
Ovid when he raised his stately shining heathen temple had placed
some columns in it and hewn out a statue or two which deserved the
immortality that he prophesied somewhat arrogantly for himself But
let not all be looking forward to a future and fancying that incerti
spatium dum finiat aevi our books are to be immortal Alas the way to
immortality is not so easy nor will our Sea Captain be permitted such
an unconscionable cruise If all the immortalities were really to have
their wish what a work would our descendants have to study them all

Not yet in my humble opinion has the honorable baronet achieved this
deathless consummation There will come a day may it be long distant
when the very best of his novels will be forgotten and it is reasonable
to suppose that his dramas will pass out of existence some time or
other in the lapse of the secula seculorum In the meantime my dear
Plush if you ask me what the great obstacle is towards the dramatic
fame and merit of our friend I would say that it does not lie so much
in hostile critics or feeble health as in a careless habit of writing
and a peevish vanity which causes him to shut his eyes to his faults
The question of original capacity I will not moot one may think very
highly of the honorable baronets talent without rating it quite so
high as he seems disposed to do

And to conclude as he has chosen to combat the critics in person the
critics are surely justified in being allowed to address him directly

 With best compliments to Mrs Yellowplush
 I have the honor to be dear Sir
 Your most faithful and obliged
 humble servant
 JOHN THOMAS SMITH


And now Smith having finisht his letter I think I cant do better than
clothes mine lickwise for though I should never be tired of talking
praps the public may of hearing and therefore its best to shut up

Section 2 Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergtm

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
