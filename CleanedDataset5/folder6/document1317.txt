SALTBUSH BILL JP AND OTHER VERSES





Song of the Pen



 _Not for the love of women toil we we of the craft
 Not for the peoples praise
 Only because our goddess made us her own and laughed
 Claiming us all our days

 Claiming our best endeavourbody and heart and brain
 Given with no reserve
 Niggard is she towards us granting us little gain
 Still we are proud to serve

 Not unto us is given choice of the tasks we try
 Gathering grain or chaff
 One of her favoured servants toils at an epic high
 One that a child may laugh

 Yet if we serve her truly in our appointed place
 Freely she doth accord
 Unto her faithful servants always this saving grace
 Work is its own reward_




Song of the Wheat



 We have sung the song of the droving days
 Of the march of the travelling sheep
 By silent stages and lonely ways
 Thin white battalions creep
 But the man who now by the land would thrive
 Must his spurs to a ploughshare beat
 Is there ever a man in the world alive
 To sing the song of the Wheat

 Its west by south of the Great Divide
 The grim grey plains run out
 Where the old flockmasters lived and died
 In a ceaseless fight with drought
 Weary with waiting and hope deferred
 They were ready to own defeat
 Till at last they heard the masterword
 And the masterword was Wheat

 Yarran and Myall and Box and Pine
 Twas axe and fire for all
 They scarce could tarry to blaze the line
 Or wait for the trees to fall
 Ere the team was yoked and the gates flung wide
 And the dust of the horses feet
 Rose up like a pillar of smoke to guide
 The wonderful march of Wheat

 Furrow by furrow and fold by fold
 The soil is turned on the plain
 Better than silver and better than gold
 Is the surfacemine of the grain
 Better than cattle and better than sheep
 In the fight with drought and heat
 For a streak of stubbornness wide and deep
 Lies hid in a grain of Wheat

 When the stock is swept by the hand of fate
 Deep down in his bed of clay
 The brave brown Wheat will lie and wait
 For the resurrection day
 Lie hid while the whole world thinks him dead
 But the Springrain soft and sweet
 Will over the steaming paddocks spread
 The first green flush of the Wheat

 Green and amber and gold it grows
 When the sun sinks late in the West
 And the breeze sweeps over the rippling rows
 Where the quail and the skylark nest
 Mountain or river or shining star
 Theres never a sight can beat
 Away to the skyline stretching far
 A sea of the ripening Wheat

 When the burning harvest sun sinks low
 And the shadows stretch on the plain
 The roaring strippers come and go
 Like ships on a sea of grain
 Till the lurching groaning waggons bear
 Their tale of the load complete
 Of the worlds great work he has done his share
 Who has gathered a crop of wheat

 Princes and Potentates and Czars
 They travel in regal state
 But old King Wheat has a thousand cars
 For his trip to the watergate
 And his thousand steamships breast the tide
 And plough thro the wind and sleet
 To the lands where the teeming millions bide
 That say Thank God for Wheat




Brumbys Run

 Brumby is the Aboriginal word for a wild horse At a recent trial
 a NSW Supreme Court Judge hearing of Brumby horses asked
 Who is Brumby and where is his Run



 It lies beyond the Western Pines
 Towards the sinking sun
 And not a survey mark defines
 The bounds of Brumbys Run

 On odds and ends of mountain land
 On tracks of range and rock
 Where no one else can make a stand
 Old Brumby rears his stock

 A wild unhandled lot they are
 Of every shape and breed
 They venture out neath moon and star
 Along the flats to feed

 But when the dawn makes pink the sky
 And steals along the plain
 The Brumby horses turn and fly
 Towards the hills again

 The traveller by the mountaintrack
 May hear their hoofbeats pass
 And catch a glimpse of brown and black
 Dim shadows on the grass

 The eager stockhorse pricks his ears
 And lifts his head on high
 In wild excitement when he hears
 The Brumby mob go by

 Old Brumby asks no price or fee
 Oer all his wide domains
 The man who yards his stock is free
 To keep them for his pains

 So off to scour the mountainside
 With eager eyes aglow
 To strongholds where the wild mobs hide
 The gullyrakers go

 A rush of horses through the trees
 A red shirt making play
 A sound of stockwhips on the breeze
 They vanish far away

     

 Ah me before our day is done
 We long with bitter pain
 To ride once more on Brumbys Run
 And yard his mob again




Saltbush Bill on the Patriarchs



 Come all you little rouseabouts and climb upon my knee
 Today you see is Christmas Day and so its up to me
 To give you some instruction likea kind of Christmas tale
 So name your yarn and off she goes What Jonah and the Whale

 Well whales is sheep Ive never shore Ive never been to sea
 So all them great Leviathans is mysteries to me
 But theres a tale the Bible tells I fully understand
 About the time the Patriarchs were settling on the land

 Those Patriarchs of olden time when all is said and done
 They lived the same as farout men on many a Queensland run
 A lot of roving droving men who drifted to and fro
 The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago

 Now Isaac was a squatter man and Jacob was his son
 And when the boy grew up you see he wearied of the run
 You know the way that boys grow uptheres some that stick at home
 But any boy thats worth his salt will roll his swag and roam

 So Jacob caught the roving fit and took the drovers track
 To where his uncle had a run beyond the outer back
 You see they made for outback runs for room to stretch and grow
 The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago

 Now Jacob knew the ways of stockthats most uncommon clear
 For when he got to Labans Run they made him overseer
 He didnt ask a pound a week but bargained for his pay
 To take the roan and strawberry calvesthe same wed take today

 The duns and blacks and Goulburn roans thats brindles coarse and hard
 He branded them with Labans brand in Old Man Labans yard
 So when hed done the station work for close on seven year
 Why all the choicest stock belonged to Labans overseer

 Its often so with overseersIve seen the same thing done
 By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run
 But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight
 And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate

 He gave him stock and offered him his daughters hand in troth
 And Jacob first he married one and then he married both
 You see they werent particular about a wife or so
 No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago

 But when the stock were strong and fat with grass and lots of rain
 Then Jacob felt the call to take the homeward road again
 Its strange in every creed and clime no matter where you roam
 There comes a day when every man would like to make for home

 So off he set with sheep and goats a mighty moving band
 To battle down the homeward track along the Overland
 Its droving mixedup mobs like that that makes men cut their throats
 Ive travelled rams which Lord forget but never travelled goats

 But Jacob knew the ways of stock for so the story goes
 When battling through the Philistinesselectors I suppose
 He thought hed have to fight his way an awkward sort of job
 So what did Old Man Jacob do of course he split the mob

 He sent the strong stock on ahead to battle out the way
 He couldnt hurry lambing ewesno more you could today
 And down the road from run to run his hand gainst every hand
 He moved that mighty mob of stock across the Overland

 The thing is made so clear and plain so solid in and out
 There isnt any room at all for any kind of doubt
 Its just a plain straightforward talea tale that lets you know
 The way they lived in Palestine three thousand years ago

 Its strange to read it all today the shifting of the stock
 Youd think you see the caravans that loaf behind the flock
 The little donkeys and the mules the sheep that slowly spread
 And maybe Dan or Naphthali aridin on ahead

 The long dry dusty summer days the smouldering fires at night
 The stir and bustle of the camp at break of morning light
 The little kids that skipped about the camels deadslow tramp
 I wish Id done a week or two in Old Man Jacobs camp

 _But if I keep the narrer path some day perhaps Ill know
 How Jacob bred them strawberry calves three thousand years ago_




The Reverend Mullineux



 Id reckon his weight at eightstuneight
 And his height at fivefoottwo
 With a face as plain as an eightday clock
 And a walk as brisk as a bantamcock
 Game as a bantam too
 Hard and wiry and full of steam
 Thats the boss of the English Team
 Reverend Mullineux

 Makes no row when the game gets rough
 None of your Strike me blue
 Yous wants smacking across the snout
 Plays like a gentleman outandout
 Same as he ought to do
 Kindly remove from off my face
 Thats the way that he states his case
 Reverend Mullineux

 Kick He can kick like an army mule
 Run like a kangaroo
 Hard to get by as a lawyerplant
 Tackles his man like a bulldog ant
 Fetches him over too
 _Didnt_ the public cheer and shout
 Watchin him chuckin big blokes about
 Reverend Mullineux

 Scrimmage was packed on his prostrate form
 Somehow the ball got through
 Who was it tackled our big halfback
 Flinging him down like an empty sack
 Right on our goalline too
 Who but the man that we thought was dead
 Down with a score of em on his head
 Reverend Mullineux




The Wisdom of Hafiz



 My son if you go to the races to battle with Ikey and Mo
 Remember its seldom the pigeon can pick out the eye of the crow
 Remember they live by the business remember my son and go slow

 If ever an owner should tell you Back minedont you be such a flat
 He knows his own cunning no doubtdoes he know what the others are at
 Find out what hes frightened of most and invest a few dollars on that

 Walk not in the track of the trainer nor hang round the rails at his stall
 His wisdom belongs to his patronshall he give it to one and to all
 When the stable is served he may tell youand his words
 are like jewels let fall

 Run wide of the tipster who whispers that Borak is sure to be first
 He tells the next mug that he corners a tale with the placings reversed
 And remember of judges of racing the jockeys the absolute worst

 When they lay three to one on the field and the runners are twentyandtwo
 Take a pull on yourself take a pullits a mighty big field
 to get through
 Is the club handicapper a fool If a fool is about praps its you

 Beware of the critic who tells you the handicaps absolute rot
 For this is chucked in and thats hopeless and somebody ought to be shot
 How is it he cant make a fortune himself when he knows such a lot

 From tipsters and jockeys and trials and gallops the glory has gone
 For this is the wisdom of Hafiz that sages have pondered upon
 The very best tip in the world is to see the commission go on




Saltbush Bill JP



 Beyond the land where Leichhardt went
 Beyond Sturts Western track
 The rolling tide of change has sent
 Some strange JPs out back

 And Saltbush Bill grown old and grey
 And worn with want of sleep
 Received the news in camp one day
 Behind the travelling sheep

 That Edward Rex confiding in
 His known integrity
 By hand and seal on parchment skin
 Had made him a JP

 He read the news with eager face
 But found no word of pay
 Id like to see my sisters place
 And kids on Christmas day

 Id like to see green grass again
 And watch clear water run
 Away from this unholy plain
 And flies and dust and sun

 At last one little clause he found
 That might some hope inspire
 A magistrate may charge a pound
 For inquest on a fire

 A big blacks camp was built close by
 And Saltbush Bill says he
 I think that camp might well supply
 A job for a JP

 That night by strange coincidence
 A most disastrous fire
 Destroyed the country residence
 Of Jacky Jack Esquire

 Twas mostly leaves and bark and dirt
 The party most concerned
 Appeared to think it wouldnt hurt
 If forty such were burned

 Quite otherwise thought Saltbush Bill
 Who watched the leaping flame
 The home is small said he but still
 The principles the same

 Midst palaces though you should roam
 Or follow pleasures tracks
 Youll find he said no place like home
 At least like Jacky Jacks

 Tell every man in camp Come quick
 Tell every black Maria
 I give tobacco half a stick
 Hold inquest longa fire

 Each juryman received a name
 Well suited to a Court
 Long Jack and Stumpy Bill became
 John Long and William Short

 While such as Tarpot Bullock Dray
 And Tommy WaitaWhile
 Became for ever and a day
 Scott Dickens and Carlyle

 And twelve good sable men and true
 Were soon engaged upon
 The conflagration that oerthrew
 The home of John A John

 Their verdict Burnt by act of Fate
 They scarcely had returned
 When just behind the magistrate
 Another humpy burned

 The jury sat again and drew
 Another stick of plug
 Said Saltbush Bill Its up to you
 Put some one longa Jug

 Ill camp the sheep he said and sift
 The evidence about
 For quite a week he couldnt shift
 The way the fires broke out

 The jury thought the whole concern
 As good as any play
 They used to take him oath and earn
 Three sticks of plug a day

 At last the tribe lay down to sleep
 Homeless beneath a tree
 And onward with his travelling sheep
 Went Saltbush Bill JP

 The sheep delivered safe and sound
 His horse to town he turned
 And drew some fiveandtwenty pound
 For fees that he had earned

 And where Monaros ranges hide
 Their little farms away
 His sisters children by his side
 He spent his Christmas Day

 The next JP that went out back
 Was shocked or pained or both
 At hearing every pagan black
 Repeat the jurors oath

 No matter though he turned and fled
 They followed faster still
 You make it inkwich boss they said
 All same like Saltbush Bill

 They even said theyd let him see
 The fires originate
 When he refused they said that he
 Was No good magistrate

 And out beyond Sturts Western track
 And Leichhardts farthest tree
 They wait till fate shall send them back
 Their Saltbush Bill JP




The Riders in the Stand



 Theres some that ride the Robbo style and bump at every stride
 While others sit a long way back to get a longer ride
 Theres some that ride like sailors do with legs and arms and teeth
 And some ride on the horses neck and some ride underneath

 But all the finest horsemen outthe men to Beat the Band
 Youll find amongst the crowd that ride their races in the Stand
 Theyll say He had the race in hand and lost it in the straight
 Theyll show how Godby came too soon and Barden came too late

 Theyll say Chevalley lost his nerve and Regan lost his head
 Theyll tell how one was livened up and something else was dead
 In fact the race was never run on sea or sky or land
 But what youd get it better done by riders in the Stand

 The rule holds good in everything in lifes uncertain fight
 Youll find the winner cant go wrong the loser cant go right
 You ride a slashing race and loseby one and all youre banned
 Ride like a bag of flour and wintheyll cheer you in the Stand




Waltzing Matilda

 Carrying a Swag



 Oh there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong
 Under the shade of a Coolabah tree
 And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling
 Wholl come awaltzing Matilda with me

 Wholl come awaltzing Matilda my darling
 Wholl come awaltzing Matilda with me
 Waltzing Matilda and leading a waterbag
 Wholl come awaltzing Matilda with me

 Down came a jumbuck to drink at the waterhole
 Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee
 And he sang as he put him away in his tuckerbag
 Youll come awaltzing Matilda with me

 Down came the Squatter ariding his thoroughbred
 Down came Policemenone two and three
 Whose is the jumbuck youve got in the tuckerbag
 Youll come awaltzing Matilda with me

 But the swagman he up and he jumped in the waterhole
 Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree
 And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong
 Wholl come awaltzing Matilda with me




An Answer to Various Bards



 Well Ive waited mighty patient while they all came rolling in
 Mister Lawson Mister Dyson and the others of their kin
 With their dreadful dismal stories of the Overlanders camp
 How his fire is always smoky and his boots are always damp
 And they paint it so terrific it would fill ones soul with gloom
 But you know theyre fond of writing about corpses and the tomb
 So before they curse the bushland they should let their fancy range
 And take something for their livers and be cheerful for a change

 Now for instance Mr Lawsonwell of course we almost cried
 At the sorrowful description how his little Arvie died
 And we lachrymosed in silence when His Fathers Mate was slain
 Then he went and killed the father and we had to weep again
 Ben Duggan and Jack Denver too he caused them to expire
 And he went and cooked the gander of Jack Dunn of Nevertire
 So no doubt the bush is wretched if you judge it by the groan
 Of the sad and soulful poet with a graveyard of his own

 And he spoke in terms prophetic of a revolutions heat
 When the world should hear the clamour of those people in the street
 But the shearer chaps who start itwhy he rounds on them in blame
 And he calls em agitators who are living on the game
 But I overwrite the bushmen Well I own without a doubt
 That I always see a hero in the man from furthest out
 I could never contemplate him through an atmosphere of gloom
 And a bushman never struck me as a subject for the tomb

 If it aint all golden sunshine where the wattle branches wave
 Well it aint all damp and dismal and it aint all lonely grave
 And of course theres no denying that the bushmans life is rough
 But a man can easy stand it if hes built of sterling stuff
 Tho its seldom that the drover gets a bed of eiderdown
 Yet the man whos born a bushman he gets mighty sick of town
 For hes jotting down the figures and hes adding up the bills
 While his heart is simply aching for a sight of Southern hills

 Then he hears a woolteam passing with a rumble and a lurch
 And although the work is pressing yet it brings him off his perch
 For it stirs him like a message from his station friends afar
 And he seems to sniff the ranges in the scent of wool and tar
 And it takes him back in fancy half in laughter half in tears
 To a sound of other voices and a thought of other years
 When the woolshed rang with bustle from the dawning of the day
 And the shearblades were aclicking to the cry of Wool away

 Then his face was somewhat browner and his frame was firmer set
 And he feels his flabby muscles with a feeling of regret
 But the woolteam slowly passes and his eyes go sadly back
 To the dusty little table and the papers in the rack
 And his thoughts go to the terrace where his sickly children squall
 And he thinks theres something healthy in the bushlife after all
 But well go no more adroving in the wind or in the sun
 For our fathers hearts have failed us and the droving days are done

 Theres a nasty dash of danger where the longhorned bullock wheels
 And we like to live in comfort and to get our reglar meals
 For to hang around the townships suits us better youll agree
 And a job at washing bottles is the job for such as we
 Let us herd into the cities let us crush and crowd and push
 Till we lose the love of roving and we learn to hate the bush
 And well turn our aspirations to a city life and beer
 And well slip across to Englandits a nicer place than here

 For theres not much risk of hardship where all comforts are in store
 And the theatres are plenty and the pubs are more and more
 But that ends it Mr Lawson and its time to say goodbye
 We must agree to differ in all friendship you and I
 So well work our own salvation with the stoutest hearts we may
 And if fortune only favours we will take the road some day
 And go droving down the river neath the sunshine and the stars
 And then return to Sydney and vermilionize the bars




TYSON



 Across the Queensland border line
 The mobs of cattle go
 They travel down in sun and shine
 On dusty stage and slow
 The drovers riding slowly on
 To let the cattle spread
 Will say Heres one old landmark gone
 For old man Tysons dead

 What tales therell be in every camp
 By men that Tyson knew
 The swagmen meeting on the tramp
 Will yarn the long day through
 And tell of how he passed as Brown
 And fooled the local men
 But not for meI struck the town
 And passed the message further down
 Thats TYSON

 There stands a little country town
 Beyond the border line
 Where dusty roads go up and down
 And banks with pubs combine
 A stranger came to cash a cheque
 Few were the words he said
 A handkerchief about his neck
 An old hat on his head

 A long grey stranger eagleeyed
 Know me Of course you do
 Its not my work the boss replied
 To know such tramps as you
 Well look here Mister dont be flash
 Replied the stranger then
 I never care to make a splash
 Im simplebut Ive got the cash
 Im TYSON

 But in that last great draftingyard
 Where Peter keeps the gate
 And souls of sinners find it barred
 And go to meet their fate
 Theres one who ought to enter in
 For good deeds done on earth
 Such deeds as merit ought to win
 Kind deeds of sterling worth

 Not by the strait and narrow gate
 Reserved for wealthy men
 But through the big gate opened wide
 The grizzled figure eagleeyed
 Will travel throughand then
 Old Peterll say We pass him through
 Theres many a thing he used to do
 Goodhearted things that no one knew
 Thats TYSON




As Long as your Eyes are Blue



 Wilt thou love me sweet when my hair is grey
 And my cheeks shall have lost their hue
 When the charms of youth shall have passed away
 Will your love as of old prove true

 For the looks may change and the heart may range
 And the love be no longer fond
 Wilt thou love with truth in the years of youth
 And away to the years beyond

 Oh I love you sweet for your locks of brown
 And the blush on your cheek that lies
 But I love you most for the kindly heart
 That I see in your sweet blue eyes

 For the eyes are signs of the soul within
 Of the heart that is leal and true
 And mine own sweetheart I shall love you still
 Just as long as your eyes are blue

 For the locks may bleach and the cheeks of peach
 May be reft of their golden hue
 But mine own sweetheart I shall love you still
 Just as long as your eyes are blue




BottleO



 I aint the kind of bloke as takes to any steady job
 I drives me bottle cart around the town
 A bloke what keeps is eyes about can always make a bob
 I couldnt bear to graft for every brown
 Theres lots of handy things about in everybodys yard
 Theres cocks and hens arunnin to an fro
 And little dogs what comes and barkswe take em off their guard
 And we puts em with the Empty BottleO

 Chorus

 So its any Empty bottles Any empty bottleO
 You can hear us round for a half a mile or so
 And youll see the women rushing
 To take in the Mondays washing
 When they ear us crying Empty BottleO

 Im drivin down by Wexfordstreet and up a winder goes
 A girl sticks out er ead and looks at me
 An allright tart with ginger air and freckles on er nose
 I stops the cart and walks across to see
 There aint no bottles ere says she since father took the pledge
 No bottles ere says I Id like to know
 What right you ave to stick your ead outside the winder ledge
 If you avent got no Empty BottleO

 I sometimes gives the orse a spell and then the push and me
 We takes a little trip to Chowder Bay
 Oh aint it nice the ole day long agazin at the sea
 And ahidin of the tanglefoot away
 But when the booze gits old of us and fellows starts to scrap
 Theres some what likes bluemetal for to throw
 But as for me I always says for layin out a trap
 Theres nothin like an Empty BottleO




The Story of Mongrel Grey



 This is the story the stockman told
 On the cattle camp when the stars were bright
 The moon rose up like a globe of gold
 And flooded the plain with her mellow light
 We watched the cattle till dawn of day
 And he told me the story of Mongrel Grey

     

 He was a knockabout station hack
 Spurred and walloped and banged and beat
 Ridden all day with a sore on his back
 Left all night with nothing to eat
 That was a matter of everyday
 Common occurrence to Mongrel Grey

 We might have sold him but someone heard
 He was bred out back on a flooded run
 Where he learnt to swim like a waterbird
 Midnight or midday were all as one
 In the flooded ground he could find his way
 Nothing could puzzle old Mongrel Grey

 Tis a special gift that some horses learn
 When the floods are out they will splash along
 In girthdeep water and twist and turn
 From hidden channel and billabong
 Never mistaking the road to go
 For a man may guessbut the horses _know_

 I was camping out with my youngest son
 Bit of a nipper just learnt to speak
 In an empty hut on the lower run
 Shooting and fishing in Conroys Creek
 The youngster toddled about all day
 And with our horses was Mongrel Grey

 All of a sudden the flood came down
 Fresh from the hills with the mountain rain
 Roaring and eddying rank and brown
 Over the flats and across the plain
 Rising and risingat fall of night
 Nothing but water appeared in sight

 Tis a nasty place when the floods are out
 Even in daylight for all around
 Channels and billabongs twist about
 Stretching for miles in the flooded ground
 And to move was a hopeless thing to try
 In the dark with the water just racing by

 I had to try it I heard a roar
 And the wind swept down with the blinding rain
 And the water rose till it reached the floor
 Of our highest room and twas very plain
 The way the water was sweeping down
 We must shift for the highlands at once or drown

 Off to the stable I splashed and found
 The horses shaking with cold and fright
 I led them down to the lower ground
 But never a yard would they swim that night
 They reared and snorted and turned away
 And none would face it but Mongrel Grey

 I bound the child on the horses back
 And we started off with a prayer to heaven
 Through the rain and the wind and the pitchy black
 For I knew that the instinct God has given
 To guide His creatures by night and day
 Would lead the footsteps of Mongrel Grey

 He struck deep water at once and swam
 I swam beside him and held his mane
 Till we touched the bank of the broken dam
 In shallow waterthen off again
 Swimming in darkness across the flood
 Rank with the smell of the drifting mud

 He turned and twisted across and back
 Choosing the places to wade or swim
 Picking the safest and shortest track
 The pitchy darkness was clear to him
 Did he strike the crossing by sight or smell
 The Lord that led him alone could tell

 He dodged the timber wheneer he could
 But the timber brought us to grief at last
 I was partly stunned by a log of wood
 That struck my head as it drifted past
 And I lost my grip of the brave old grey
 And in half a second he swept away

 I reached a tree where I had to stay
 And did a perish for two days hard
 And lived on waterbut Mongrel Grey
 He walked right into the homestead yard
 At dawn next morning and grazed around
 With the child on top of him safe and sound

 We keep him now for the wife to ride
 Nothing too good for him now of course
 Never a whip on his fat old hide
 For she owes the child to that old grey horse
 And not Old Tyson himself could pay
 The purchase money of Mongrel Grey




Gilhooleys Estate

 A ballad concerning the amalgamation of the legal professions



 Oh Mr Gilhooley he turned up his toes
 As most of us do soon or late
 And Jones was a lawyer as everyone knows
 So they took him Gilhooleys Estate

 Gilhooley in life had been living so free
 Twas thought his possessions were great
 So Jones with a smile says Theres many a fee
 For me in Gilhooleys Estate

 They made out a list of his property fine
 It totalled a thousandandeight
 But the debts were nine hundred and ninety and nine
 The debts of Gilhooleys Estate

 So Mrs Gilhooley says Jones my dear man
 My childer have little to ait
 Just keep the expenses as low as you can
 Against poor Gilhooleys Estate

 But Jones says The will isnt clear in its terms
 I fear it will need some debate
 And the law wont allow me attorneys are worms
 To appear in Gilhooleys Estate

 So a barristerman with a wig on his head
 And a brief in his hand quite elate
 Went up to the Court where they bury the dead
 Just to move in Gilhooleys Estate

 But his Honor the Judge said I think that the joint
 Legatees must be called to pro_bate_
 Ex parte Pokehorney is clear on the point
 The point of Gilhooleys Estate

 I order a suit to be brought just to try
 If this is correct that I state
 A nice friendly suit and the costs by and by
 Must be borne by Gilhooleys Estate

 So Mrs Gilhooley says Jones youll appear
 Thim barristers fees is too great
 The suit is but friendly Attorneys my dear
 Cant be heard in Gilhooleys Estate

 From the Barristers Court theres a mighty hurrah
 Arises both early and late
 Its only the whoop of the Junior Bar
 Dividing Gilhooleys Estate




The Road to Hogans Gap



 Now look you see its this way like
 You cross the broken bridge
 And run the crick down till you strike
 The second righthand ridge

 The track is hard to see in parts
 But still its pretty clear
 Theres been two Injin hawkers carts
 Along that road this year

 Well run that righthand ridge along
 It aint to say too steep
 Theres two fresh tracks might put you wrong
 Where blokes went out with sheep

 But keep the crick upon your right
 And follow pretty straight
 Along the spur until you sight
 A wire and sapling gate

 Well thats where Hogans old grey mare
 Fell off and broke her back
 Youll see her carcase layin there
 Jist down below the track

 And then you drop two mile or three
 Its pretty steep and blind
 You want to go and fall a tree
 And tie it on behind

 And then you pass a broken cart
 Below a granite bluff
 And that is where you strike the part
 They reckon pretty rough

 But by the time youve got that far
 Its either cure or kill
 So turn your horses round the spur
 And face em up the hill

 For look if you should miss the slope
 And get below the track
 You havent got the whitest hope
 Of ever gettin back

 An half way up youll see the hide
 Of Hogans brindled bull
 Well mind and keep the righthand side
 The lefts too steep a pull

 And both the banks is full of cracks
 An just about at dark
 Youll see the last years bullock tracks
 Where Hogan drew the bark

 The marks is old and pretty faint
 And grown with scrub and such
 Of course the track to Hogans aint
 A road thats travelled much

 But turn and run the tracks along
 For half a mile or more
 And then of course you cant go wrong
 Youre right at Hogans door

 When first you come to Hogans gate
 He mightnt show perhaps
 Hes pretty sure to plant and wait
 To see it aint the traps

 I wouldnt call it good enough
 To let your horses out
 Theres some thats pretty extra rough
 Is livin round about

 Its likely if your horses did
 Get feedin near the track
 Its goin to cost at least a quid
 Or more to get them back

 So if you find theyre off the place
 Its up to you to go
 And flash a quid in Hogans face
 Hell know the blokes that know

 But listen if youre feelin dry
 Just see theres no one near
 And go and wink the other eye
 And ask for ginger beer

 The blokes come in from near and far
 To sample Hogans pop
 They reckon once they breast the bar
 They stay there till they drop

 On Sundays you can see them spread
 Like flies around the tap
 Its like that song The Livin Dead
 Up there at Hogans Gap

 They like to make it pretty strong
 Whenever theres a charnce
 So when a stranger comes along
 They always holds a darnce

 Theres recitations songs and fights
 A willin lot youll meet
 Theres one long bloke up there recites
 I tell youhes a treat

 Theyre lively blokes all right up there
 Its never dull a day
 Id go meself if I could spare
 The time to get away

     

 The stranger turned his horses quick
 He didnt cross the bridge
 He didnt go along the crick
 To strike the second ridge

 He didnt make the trip because
 He wasnt feeling fit
 His business up at Hogans was
 To serve him with a writ

 He reckoned if he faced the pull
 And climbed the rocky stair
 The next to come might find his hide
 A landmark on the mountain side
 Along with Hogans brindled bull
 And Hogans old grey mare




A Singer of the Bush



 There is waving of grass in the breeze
 And a song in the air
 And a murmur of myriad bees
 That toil everywhere
 There is scent in the blossom and bough
 And the breath of the Spring
 Is as soft as a kiss on a brow
 And Springtime I sing

 There is drought on the land and the stock
 Tumble down in their tracks
 Or followa tottering flock
 The scrubcutters axe
 While ever a creature survives
 The axes shall swing
 We are fighting with fate for their lives
 And the combat I sing




Shouting for a Camel



 It was over at Coolgardie that a mining speculator
 Who was going down the township just to make a bit o chink
 Went off to hire a camel from a camel propagator
 And the Afghan said hed lend it if hed stand the beast a drink
 Yes the only price he asked him was to stand the beast a drink
 He was cheap very cheap as the dromedaries go

 So the mining speculator made the bargain proudly thinking
 He had bested old Mahomet he had done him in the eye
 Then he clambered on the camel and the while the beast was drinking
 He explained with satisfaction to the miners standing by
 That twas cheap very cheap as the dromedaries go

 But the camel kept on drinking and he filled his hold with water
 And the more he had inside him yet the more he seemed to need
 For he drank it by the gallon and his girths grew taut and tauter
 And the miners muttered softly Yes hes very dry indeed
 But hes cheap very cheap as the dromedaries go

 So he drank up twenty bucketsit was weird to watch him suck it
 And the market price for water was per bucket halfacrown
 Till the speculator stopped him saying Not another bucket
 If I give him any more therell be a famine in the town
 Take him back to old Mahomet and Ill tramp it through the town
 He was cheap very cheap as the speculators go

 Theres a moral to this storyin your hat you ought to paste it
 Be careful whom you shout for when a camel is about
 And theres plenty human camels who before theyll see you waste it
 Will drink up all you pay for if youre fool enough to shout
 If you chance to strike a camel when youre fool enough to shout
 Youll be cheap very cheap as the speculators go




The Lost Drink



 I had spent the night in the watchhouse
 My head was the size of three
 So I went and asked the chemist
 To fix up a drink for me
 And he brewed it from various bottles
 With soda and plenty of ice
 With something that smelt like lemon
 And something that seemed like spice

 It fell on my parching palate
 Like the dew on a sunbaked plain
 And my system began to flourish
 Like the grass in a soft spring rain
 It wandered throughout my being
 Suffusing my soul with rest
 And I felt as I scoffed that liquid
 That life had a newfound zest

 I have been on the razzledazzle
 Full many a time since then
 But I never could get the chemist
 To brew me that drink again
 He says hes forgotten the notion
 Twas only by chance it came
 Hes tried me with various liquids
 But oh they are not the same

 We have sought but we sought it vainly
 That one lost drink divine
 We have sampled his various bottles
 But somehow they dont combine
 Yet I know when I cross the River
 And stand on the Golden Shore
 I shall meet with an angelchemist
 Wholl brew me that drink once more




Mulligans Mare



 Oh Mulligans bar was the deuce of a place
 To drink and to fight and to gamble and race
 The height of choice spirits from near and from far
 Were all concentrated on Mulligans bar

 There was Jerry the Swell and the jockeyboy Ned
 Dogbitemeso called from the shape of his head
 And a man whom the boys in their musical slang
 Designed as the Gaffer of Mulligans Gang

 Now Mulligans Gang had a racer to show
 A bad un to look at a good un to go
 Whenever they backed her you safely might swear
 Shed walk in a winner would Mulligans mare

 But Mulligan having some radical views
 Neglected his business and got on the booze
 He took up with runnersa treacherous troop
 Who gave him away and he fell in the soup

 And so it turned out on a fine summer day
 A bailiff turned up with a writ of fi fa
 He walked to the bar with a manner serene
 I levy said he in the name of the Queen

 Then Mulligan wanted in spite of the law
 To pay out the bailiff with _one_ on the jaw
 He drew out to hit him but ere you could wink
 He changed his intentions and stood him a drink

 A great consultation there straightway befel
 Twixt jockeyboy Neddy and Jerry the Swell
 And the man with the head who remarked Why you bet
 Dogbiteme said he but well diddle em yet

 Well slip out the mare from her stall in a crack
 And put in her place the old brokendown hack
 The hack is so like her Im ready to swear
 The bailiff will think he has Mulligans mare

 So out with the racer and in with the screw
 Well show him what Mulligans talent can do
 And if he gets nasty and dares to say much
 Ill knock him as stiff as my grandmothers crutch

 Then off to the town went the mare and the lad
 The bailiff came out never dreamt he was had
 But marched to the stall with a confident air
 I levy said he upon Mulligans mare

 He watched her by day and he watched her by night
 She was never an instant let out of his sight
 For races were coming away in the West
 And Mulligans mare had a chance with the best

 Heres a chance thought the bailiff to serve my own ends
 Ill send off a wire to my bookmaking friends
 Get all you can borrow beg snavel or snare
 And lay the whole lot against Mulligans mare

 The races came round and a crowd on the course
 Were laying the mare till they made themselves hoarse
 And Mulligans party with ardour intense
 They backed her for pounds and for shillings and pence

 And think of the grief of the bookmaking host
 At the sound of the summons to go to the post
 For down to the start with her thoroughbred air
 As fit as a fiddle pranced Mulligans mare

 They started and off went the boy to the front
 He cleared out at once and he made it a hunt
 He steadied as rounding the corner they wheeled
 Then gave her her head and she smothered the field

 The race put her owner right clear of his debts
 He landed a fortune in stakes and in bets
 He paid the old bailiff the whole of his pelf
 And gave him a hiding to keep for himself

 So all you bold sportsmen take warning I pray
 Keep clear of the running youll find it dont pay
 For the very best rule that youll hear in a week
 Is never to bet on a thing that can speak

 And whether youre lucky or whether you lose
 Keep clear of the cards and keep clear of the booze
 And fortune in season will answer your prayer
 And send you a flyer like Mulligans mare




The Matrimonial Stakes



 I wooed her with a steeplechase I won her with a fall
 I made her heartstrings quiver on the flat
 When the pony missed his takeoff and we crashed into the wall
 Well she simply _had_ to have me after that

 It awoke a thrill of interest when they pulled me out for dead
 From beneath the shattered ruins of a horse
 And although she _looked_ indifferent when I landedon my head
 In the water it appealed to her of course

 When I won the Flappers Flatrace it was all Sir Garneo
 For she praised the way I made my final run
 And she thought the riding did itfor how _could_ the poor girl know
 That a monkey could have ridden it and won

 Then they weighed me in a winnerits not often that occurs
 So I didnt let my golden chances slip
 For I showed her all the bloodmarks where I jabbed him with the spurs
 And the whipstrokes where I hit him with the whip

 Then I asked her if she loved me and she seemed inclined to shirk
 For a moment so I took her by the head
 So to speak and rushed her at it and she seemed to like the work
 When she kissed me though she blushed a rosy red

 Shes a mouth as soft as velvet and she plenty has of heart
 I could worship every little step she takes
 And the saddlingbell is ringing so were going to the start
 Certain winners for the Matrimonial Stakes




The Mountain Squatter



 Here in my mountain home
 On rugged hills and steep
 I sit and watch you come
 O Riverina Sheep

 You come from fertile plains
 Where saltbush sometimes grows
 And flats that when it rains
 Will blossom like the rose

 But when the summer sun
 Gleams down like burnished brass
 You have to leave your run
 And hustle off for grass

 Tis then thatforced to roam
 You come to where I keep
 Here in my mountain home
 A boardinghouse for sheep

 Around me where I sit
 The wary wombat goes
 A beast of little wit
 But what he knows he _knows_

 The very same remark
 Applies to me also
 I dont give out a spark
 But what I know I _know_

 My brain perhaps would show
 No convolutions deep
 But anyhow I know
 The way to handle sheep

 These Riverina cracks
 They do not care to ride
 The halfinch hanging tracks
 Along the mountain side

 Their horses shake with fear
 When loosened boulders go
 With leaps like startled deer
 Down to the gulfs below

 Their very dogs will shirk
 And drop their tails in fright
 When asked to go and work
 A mob thats out of sight

 My little collie pup
 Works silently and wide
 Youll see her climbing up
 Along the mountain side

 As silent as a fox
 Youll see her come and go
 A shadow through the rocks
 Where ash and messmate grow

 Then lost to sight and sound
 Behind some rugged steep
 She works her way around
 And gathers up the sheep

 And working wide and shy
 She holds them rounded up
 The cash aint coined to buy
 That little collie pup

 And so I draw a screw
 For self and dog and keep
 To boundaryride for you
 O Riverina Sheep

 And when the autumn rain
 Has made the herbage grow
 You travel off again
 And gladno doubtto go

 But some are left behind
 Around the mountains spread
 For those we cannot find
 We put them down as dead

 But when we say adieu
 And close the boarding job
 I always find a few
 Fresh earmarks in my mob

 So what with those I sell
 And what with those I keep
 You pay me pretty well
 O Riverina Sheep

 Its up to me to shout
 Before we say goodbye
 Heres to a howlin drought
 All west of Gundagai




Pioneers



 They came of bold and roving stock that would not fixed abide
 They were the sons of field and flock since eer they learnt to ride
 We may not hope to see such men in these degenerate years
 As those explorers of the bushthe brave old pioneers

 Twas they who rode the trackless bush in heat and storm and drought
 Twas they who heard the masterword that called them farther out
 Twas they who followed up the trail the mountain cattle made
 And pressed across the mighty range where now their bones are laid

 But now the times are dull and slow the brave old days are dead
 When hardy bushmen started out and forced their way ahead
 By tangled scrub and forests grim towards the unknown west
 And spied the faroff promised land from off the ranges crest

 Oh ye that sleep in lonely graves by faroff ridge and plain
 We drink to you in silence now as Christmas comes again
 To you who fought the wilderness through rough unsettled years
 The founders of our nations life the brave old pioneers




Santa Claus in the Bush



 It chanced out back at the Christmas time
 When the wheat was ripe and tall
 A stranger rode to the farmers gate
 A sturdy man and a small

 Rin doon rin doon my little son Jack
 And bid the stranger stay
 And well hae a crack for Auld Lang Syne
 For the morn is Christmas Day

 Nay now nay now said the dour goodwife
 But ye should let him be
 Hes maybe only a drover chap
 Frae the land o the Darling Pea

 Wi a drovers tales and a drovers thirst
 To swiggle the hail nicht through
 Or hes maybe a life assurance carle
 To talk ye black and blue

 Guid wife hes never a drover chap
 For their swags are neat and thin
 And hes never a life assurance carle
 Wi the brickdust burnt in his skin

 Guid wife guid wife be nae sae dour
 For the wheat stands ripe and tall
 And we shore a sevenpound fleece this year
 Ewes and weaners and all

 There is grass tae spare and the stock are fat
 Where they whiles are gaunt and thin
 And we owe a tithe to the travelling poor
 So we maun ask him in

 Ye can set him a chair tae the table side
 And gi him a bite tae eat
 An omelette made of a newlaid egg
 Or a tasty bit of meat

 But the native cats hae taen the fowls
 They havena left a leg
 And hell get nae omelette here at a
 Till the emu lays an egg

 Rin doon rin doon my little son Jack
 To whaur the emus bide
 Ye shall find the auld hen on the nest
 While the auld cock sits beside

 But speak them fair and speak them saft
 Lest they kick ye a fearsome jolt
 Ye can gi them a feed of thae halfinch nails
 Or a rusty carriage bolt

 So little son Jack ran blithely down
 With the rusty nails in hand
 Till he came where the emus fluffed and scratched
 By their nest in the open sand

 And there he has gathered the newlaid egg
 Twould feed three men or four
 And the emus came for the halfinch nails
 Right up to the settlers door

 A waste o food said the dour goodwife
 As she took the egg with a frown
 But he gets nae meat unless ye rin
 A paddymelon down

 Gae oot gae oot my little son Jack
 Wi your twathree doggies sma
 Gin ye come nae back wi a paddymelon
 Then come nae back at a

 So little son Jack he raced and he ran
 And he was bare o the feet
 And soon he captured a paddymelon
 Was gorged with the stolen wheat

 Sit doon sit doon my bonny wee man
 To the best that the hoose can do
 An omelette made of the emu egg
 And a paddymelon stew

 Tis well tis well said the bonny wee man
 I have eaten the wide worlds meat
 And the food that is given with right good will
 Is the sweetest food to eat

 But the night draws on to the Christmas Day
 And I must rise and go
 For I have a mighty way to ride
 To the land of the Esquimaux

 And its there I must load my sledges up
 With reindeers fourinhand
 That go to the North South East and West
 To every Christian land

 Tae the Esquimaux said the dour goodwife
 Ye suit my husband well
 For when he gets up on his journey horse
 Hes a bit of a liar himsel

 Then out with a laugh went the bonny wee man
 To his old horse grazing nigh
 And away like a meteor flash they went
 Far off to the Northern sky

     

 When the children woke on the Christmas morn
 They chattered with might and main
 For a sword and gun had little son Jack
 And a braw new doll had Jane
 And a packet o nails had the twa emus
 But the dour goodwife got nane




In Re a Gentleman One

 When an attorney is called before the Full Court to answer
 for any alleged misconduct it is not usual to publish his name
 until he is found guilty until then the matter appears in the papers
 as In re a Gentleman One of the Attorneys of the Supreme Court
 or more shortly In re a Gentleman One



 We see it each day in the paper
 And know that theres mischief in store
 That some unprofessional caper
 Has landed a shark on the shore
 We know therell be plenty of trouble
 Before they get through with the fun
 Because hes been coming the double
 On clients has Gentleman One

 Alas for the gallant attorney
 Intent upon cutting a dash
 Sets out on lifes perilous journey
 With rather more cunning than cash
 And fortune at first is inviting
 He struts his brief hour in the sun
 But lo on the wall is the writing
 Of Nemesis Gentleman One

 For soon he runs short of the dollars
 He fears he must go to the wall
 So Peters trustmoney he collars
 To pay off his creditor Paul
 Then robs right and leftfor he goes it
 In earnest when once hes begun
 Descensus Avernihe knows it
 Its easy for Gentleman One

 The crash comes as sure as the seasons
 He loses his coin in a mine
 Or booming in land or for reasons
 Connected with women and wine
 Or maybe the cards or the horses
 A share of the damage have done
 No matter the end of the course is
 The same Re a Gentleman One

 He struggles awhile to keep going
 To stave off detection and shame
 But creditors clamorous growing
 Ere long put an end to the game
 At length the poor soldier of Satan
 His course to a finish has run
 And just think of Windeyer waiting
 To deal with A Gentleman One

 And some face it boldly and brazen
 The shame and the utter disgrace
 While others more sensitive hasten
 Their names and their deeds to efface
 They snap the frail thread which the Furies
 And Fates have so cruelly spun
 May the great Final Judge and His juries
 Have mercy on Gentleman One




The Melting of the Snow



 Theres a sunny Southern land
 And its there that I would be
 Where the big hills stand
 In the South Countrie
 When the wattles bloom again
 Then its time for us to go
 To the old Monaro country
 At the melting of the snow

 To the East or to the West
 Or wherever you may be
 You will find no place
 Like the South Countrie
 For the skies are blue above
 And the grass is green below
 In the old Monaro country
 At the melting of the snow

 Now the team is in the plough
 And the thrushes start to sing
 And the pigeons on the bough
 Sit awelcoming the Spring
 So come my comrades all
 Let us saddle up and go
 To the old Monaro country
 At the melting of the snow




A Dream of the Melbourne Cup

 1886



 Bring me a quart of colonial beer
 And some doughy damper to make good cheer
 I must make a heavy dinner
 Heavily dine and heavily sup
 Of indigestible things fill up
 Next month they run the Melbourne Cup
 And I have to dream the winner

 Stoke it in boys the halfcooked ham
 The rich ragout and the charming cham
 Ive got to mix my liquor
 Give me a ganders gaunt hind leg
 Hard and tough as a wooden peg
 And Ill keep it down with a hardboiled egg
 Twill make me dream the quicker

 Now I am full of fearful feed
 Now I may dream a race indeed
 In my restless troubled slumber
 While the nightmares race through my heated brain
 And their devilriders spur amain
 The tip for the Cup will reward my pain
 And Ill spot the winning number

     

 Thousands and thousands and thousands more
 Like sands on the white Pacific shore
 The crowding people cluster
 For evermore its the story old
 While races are bought and backers are sold
 Drawn by the greed of the gain of gold
 In their thousands still they muster

 And the bookies cries grow fierce and hot
 Ill lay the Cup The double if not
 Five monkeys Little John sir
 Heres fives bar one I lay I lay
 And so they shout through the livelong day
 And stick to the game that is sure to pay
 While fools put money on sir

 And now in my dream I seem to go
 And bet with a book that I seem to know
 A Hebrew moneylender
 A million to five is the price I get
 Not bad but before I book the bet
 The horses name I clean forget
 Its number and even gender

 Now for the start and here they come
 And the hoofstrokes roar like a mighty drum
 Beat by a hand unsteady
 They come like a rushing roaring flood
 Hurrah for the speed of the Chester blood
 For Acme is making the pace so good
 There are some of em done already

 But round the back she begins to tire
 And a mighty shout goes up Crossfire
 The magpie jackets leading
 And Crossfire challenges fierce and bold
 And the lead shell have and the lead shell hold
 But at length gives way to the black and gold
 Which away to the front is speeding

 Carry them on and keep it up
 A flying race is the Melbourne Cup
 You must race and stay to win it
 And old Commotion Victorias pride
 Now takes the lead with his raking stride
 And a mighty roar goes far and wide
 Theres only Commotion in it

 But one draws out from the beaten ruck
 And up on the rails by a piece of luck
 He comes in a style thats clever
 Its Trident Trident Hurrah for Hales
 Go at em now while their courage fails
 Trident Trident for New South Wales
 The blue and white for ever

 Under the whip with the ears flat back
 Under the whip though the sinews crack
 No sign of the base white feather
 Stick to it now for your breedings sake
 Stick to it now though your hearts should break
 While the yells and roars make the grandstand shake
 They come down the straight together

 Trident slowly forges ahead
 The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red
 The pace is undiminished
 Now for the Panics that never fail
 But many a backers face grows pale
 As old Commotion swings his tail
 And swervesand the Cup is finished

     

 And now in my dream it all comes back
 I bet my coin on the Sydney crack
 A million Ive won no question
 Give me my money you hookednosed hog
 Give me my money bookmaking dog
 But he disappeared in a kind of fog
 And I woke with the indigestion




The Gundaroo Bullock



 Oh theres some that breeds the Devon thats as solid as a stone
 And theres some that breeds the brindle which they call the Goulburn Roan
 But amongst the breeds of cattle there are very very few
 Like the hairywhiskered bullock that they bred at Gundaroo

 Far away by Grabben Gullen where the Murrumbidgee flows
 Theres a block of broken countryside where no one ever goes
 For the banks have gripped the squatters and the free selectors too
 And their stock are always stolen by the men of Gundaroo

 There came a low informer to the Grabben Gullen side
 And he said to Smith the squatter You must saddle up and ride
 For your bullocks in the harnesscask of Morgan Donahoo
 Hes the greatest cattlestealer that abides in Gundaroo

 Oh ho said Smith the owner of the Grabben Gullen run
 Ill go and get the troopers by the sinking of the sun
 And down into his homestead tonight well take a ride
 With warrants to identify the carcase and the hide

 That night rode down the troopers the squatter at their head
 They rode into the homestead and pulled Morgan out of bed
 Now show to us the carcase of the bullock that you slew
 The great marsupial bullock that you killed in Gundaroo

 They peered into the harnesscask and found it wasnt full
 But down among the brine they saw some flesh and bits of wool
 Whats this exclaimed the trooperan infant I declare
 Said Morgan Tis the carcase of an old man native bear
 I heard that ye were coming so an old man bear I slew
 Just to give you kindly welcome to my home in Gundaroo

 The times is something awful as you can plainly see
 The banks have broke the squatters and theyve broke the likes of me
 We cant afford a bullocksuch expense would never do
 So an old man bear for breakfast is a treat in Gundaroo

 And along by Grabben Gullen where the rushing river flows
 In the block of broken country where theres no one ever goes
 On the Upper Murrumbidgee theyre a hospitable crew
 But you mustnt ask for bullock when you go to Gundaroo




Lay of the MotorCar



 Were away and the wind whistles shrewd
 In our whiskers and teeth
 And the granitelike grey of the road
 Seems to slide underneath
 As an eagle might sweep through the sky
 So we sweep through the land
 And the pallid pedestrians fly
 When they hear us at hand

 We outpace we outlast we outstrip
 Not the fastfleeing hare
 Nor the racehorses under the whip
 Nor the birds of the air
 Can compete with our swiftness sublime
 Our ease and our grace
 We annihilate chickens and time
 And policemen and space

 Do you mind that fat grocer who crossed
 How he dropped down to pray
 In the road when he saw he was lost
 How he melted away
 Underneath and there rang through the fog
 His earsplitting squeal
 As he went Is that he or a dog
 That stuff on the wheel




The Corner Man



 I dreamed a dream at the midnight deep
 When fancies come and go
 To vex a man in his soothing sleep
 With thoughts of awful woe
 I dreamed that I was a cornerman
 Of a nigger minstrel show

 I cracked my jokes and the building rang
 With laughter loud and long
 I hushed the house as I softly sang
 An old plantation song
 A tale of the wicked slavery days
 Of cruelty and wrong

 A small boy sat on the foremost seat
 A mirthful youngster he
 He beat the time with his restless feet
 To each new melody
 And he picked me out as the brightest star
 Of the black fraternity

 Oh father he said what _would_ we do
 If the cornerman should die
 I never saw such a mandid you
 He makes the people cry
 And then when he likes he makes them laugh
 The old man made reply

 We each of us fill a very small space
 In the great creations plan
 If a man dont keep his lead in the race
 Theres plenty more that can
 The world can very soon fill the place
 Of even a cornerman

     

 I woke with a jump rejoiced to find
 Myself at home in bed
 And I framed a moral in my mind
 From the words the old man said
 The world will jog along just the same
 When its cornermen are dead




When Dacey Rode the Mule



 Twas to a small upcountry town
 When we were boys at school
 There came a circus with a clown
 Likewise a bucking mule
 The clown announced a scheme they had
 Spectators for to bring
 Theyd give a crown to any lad
 Whod ride him round the ring

 And gentle reader do not scoff
 Nor think a man a fool
 To buck a porousplaster off
 Was pastime to that mule

 The boys got on he bucked like sin
 He threw them in the dirt
 What time the clown would raise a grin
 By asking Are you hurt
 But Johnny Dacey came one night
 The crack of all the school
 Said he Ill win the crown all right
 Bring in your bucking mule

 The elephant went off his trunk
 The monkey played the fool
 And all the band got blazing drunk
 When Dacey rode the mule

 But soon there rose a galling shout
 Of laughter for the clown
 From somewhere in his pants drew out
 A little paper crown
 He placed the crown on Daceys head
 While Dacey looked a fool
 Now theres your crown my lad he said
 For riding of the mule

 The band struck up with Killaloe
 And Rule Britannia Rule
 And Young Man from the Country too
 When Dacey rode the mule

 Then Dacey in a furious rage
 For vengeance on the show
 Ascended to the monkeys cage
 And let the monkeys go
 The bluetailed ape and chimpanzee
 He turned abroad to roam
 Good faith It was a sight to see
 The people step for home

 For big baboons with canine snout
 Are spiteful as a rule
 The people didnt sit it out
 When Dacey rode the mule

 And from the beasts that made escape
 The bushmen all declare
 Were born some creatures partly ape
 And partly nativebear
 Theyre rather few and far between
 The race is nearly spent
 But some of them may still be seen
 In Sydney Parliament

 And when those legislators fight
 And drink and act the fool
 Just blame it on that torrid night
 When Dacey rode the mule




The Mylora Elopement



 By the winding Wollondilly where the weeping willows weep
 And the shepherd with his billy half awake and half asleep
 Folds his fleecy flocks that linger homewards in the setting sun
 Lived my hero Jim the Ringer cocky on Mylora Run

 Jimmy loved the supers daughter Miss Amelia Jane McGrath
 Long and earnestly he sought her but he feared her stern papa
 And Amelia loved him trulybut the course of love if true
 Never yet ran smooth or duly as I think it ought to do

 Watching with his slow affection once Jim saw McGrath the boss
 Riding out by Jims selection looking for a station oss
 That was running in the ranges with a mob of outlaws wild
 Old McGrath Good day exchangesoff goes Jim to see his child

 Says The old mans after Stager which hell find is no light job
 And tomorrow I will wager he will try and yard the mob
 Will you come with me tomorrow I will let the parson know
 And for ever joy or sorrow he will join us here below

 I will bring my nags so speedy Crazy Jane and Tambourine
 One more kissdont think Im greedygoodbye lass before Im seen
 Just one moreGod bless you dearie Dont forget to meet me here
 Life without you is but weary now once more goodbye my dear

     

 The daylight shines on figures twain
 That ride across Mylora plain
 Laughing and talkingJim and Jane
 Steadily darling Theres lots of time
 Didnt we slip the old man prime
 I knew hed tackle that Bowneck mob
 I reckon hell find it too big a job
 Theyve beaten us all I had a try
 But the warrigal devils seem to fly
 That Sambos a real good bit of stuff
 No doubt but not quite good enough
 Hell have to gallop the livelong day
 To cut and come to race and stay
 I hope he yards em twill do him good
 To see us going I dont think would
 A turn in the road and fair and square
 They meet the old man standing there
 Whats up Why running away of course
 Says Jim emboldened The old man turned
 His eye with wild excitement burned
 Ive raced all day through the scorching heat
 After old Bowneck and now Im beat
 But over that range I think youll find
 The Bowneck mob all run stoneblind
 Will you go and leave the mob behind
 Which will you do Take the girl away
 Or ride like a white man should today
 And yard old Bowneck Go or stay
 Says Jim I cant throw this away
 We can bolt some other day of course
 Amelia Jane get off that horse
 Up you get Old Man Whoop halloo
 Here goes to put old Bowneck through
 Two distant specks on the mountain side
 Two stockwhips echoing far and wide
 Amelia Jane sat down and cried

     

 Sakes Amelia whats up now
 Leading old Sambo too I vow
 And him dead beat Where have you been
 Bolted with Jim What _do_ you mean
 Met the old man with Sambo licked
 From running old Bowneck Well Im kicked
 Ran em till Sambo nearly dropped
 What did Jim do when you were stopped
 Did you bolt from father across the plain
 Jim made you get off Crazy Jane
 And father got on and away again
 The two of em went to the ranges grim
 Good boy Jimmy Well done Jim
 Theyre sure to get them now of course
 That Tambourine is a spanking horse
 And Crazy Jane is good as gold
 And Jim they say rides pretty bold
 Not like your father but very fair
 Jim will have to follow the mare
 It never was yet in fathers hide
 To best my Jim on the mountainside
 Jim can rally and Jim can ride
 But here again Amelia cried

     

 The sound of a whip comes faint and far
 A rattle of hoofs and here they are
 In all their tameless pride
 The fleet wild horses snort with fear
 And wheel and break as the yard draws near
 Now Jim the Ringer ride
 Wheel em wheel em Whoa back there whoa
 And the foamflakes fly like the driven snow
 As under the whip the horses go
 Adown the mountain side
 And Jim hands down and teeth firm set
 On a horse that never has failed him yet
 Is after them down the range
 Well ridden well ridden they wheelwhoa back
 And long and loud the stockwhips crack
 Their flying course they change
 Steadily does itlet Sambo go
 Open those sliprails down below
 Smart or youll be too late
 Theyll follow old Sambo uplook out
 Wheel that black horsegive Sam a clout
 Theyre in Make fast the gate

     

 The mob is safely in the yard
 The old man mounts delighted guard
 No thought has he but for his prize
 Jim catches poor Amelias eyes
 Will you come after all the job is done
 And Crazy Jane is fit to run
 For a princes lifenow dont say no
 Slip on while the old mans down below
 At the inner yard and away well go
 Will you come my girl I will you bet
 Well manage this here elopement yet

     

 By the winding Wollondilly stands the hut of Ringer Jim
 And his loving little Meely makes a perfect god of him
 He has stalwart sons and daughters and I think before hes done
 Therell be numerous Sixfortys taken on Mylora run




The Pannikin Poet



 Theres nothing here sublime
 But just a roving rhyme
 Run off to pass the time
 With nought titanic in
 The theme that it supports
 And though it treats of quarts
 Its bare of golden thoughts
 Its just a pannikin

 I think its rather hard
 That each Australian bard
 Each wan poetic card
 With thoughts galvanic in
 His fiery soul alight
 In wild aerial flight
 Will sit him down and write
 About a pannikin

 He makes some newchum fare
 From out his English lair
 To hunt the native bear
 That curious mannikin
 And then when times get bad
 That wandering English lad
 Writes out a message sad
 Upon his pannikin

 Oh mother think of me
 Beneath the wattle tree
 For you may bet that he
 Will drag the wattle in
 Oh mother here I think
 That I shall have to sink
 There aint a single drink
 The waterbottle in

 The dingo homeward hies
 The sooty crows uprise
 And caw their fierce surprise
 A tone Satanic in
 And bearded bushmen tread
 Around the sleepers head
 See herethe bloke is dead
 Now wheres his pannikin

 They read his words and weep
 And lay him down to sleep
 Where wattlebranches sweep
 A style mechanic in
 And reader thats the way
 The poets of today
 Spin out their little lay
 About a pannikin




Not on It



 The new chums polo pony was the smartest pony yet
 The owner backed it for the Cup for all that he could get
 The books were laying fives to one in tenners and you bet
 He was on it

 The bell was rung the nags came out their quality to try
 The band played What Ho Robbo as our hero cantered by
 The people in the Leger Stand cried out Hi Mister Hi
 Are you on it

 They watched him as the flag went down his fate is quickly told
 The pony gave a sudden spring and off the rider rolled
 The pony finished first all right but then our hero bold
 Was not on it

 Of each bumblefaced kid of a boy that I meet
 Lor What a question to ast

The Scapegoat



 We have all of us read how the Israelites fled
 From Egypt with Pharaoh in eager pursuit of em
 And Pharaohs fierce troop were all put in the soup
 When the water rolled softly oer every galoot of em
 The Jews were so glad when old Pharaoh was had
 That they sounded their timbrels and capered like mad
 You see he was hated from Jordan to Cairo
 Whence comes the expression to buck against faro

 For forty long years midst perils and fears
 In deserts with never a tramline to follow by
 The Israelite horde went roaming abroad
 Like so many sundowners out on the wallaby
 When Moses who led em and taught em and fed em
 Was dying he murmured A rorty old hoss you are
 I give you command of the whole of the band
 And handed the Government over to Joshua

     

 But Moses told em before he died
 Wherever you are whatever betide
 Every year as the time draws near
 By lot or by rote choose you a goat
 And let the high priest confess on the beast
 The sins of the people the worst and the least
 Lay your sins on the goat Sure the plan ought to suit yer
 Because all your sins are his troubles in future
 Then lead him away to the wilderness black
 To die with the weight of your sins on his back
 Of thirst let him perish alone and unshriven
 For thus shall your sins be absolved and forgiven

 Tis needless to say though it reeked of barbarity
 This scapegoat arrangement gained great popularity
 By this means a Jew whateer he might do
 Though he burgled or murdered or cheated at loo
 Or meat on Good Friday a sin most terrific ate
 Could get his discharge like a bankrupts certificate
 Just here let us note_DID THEY CHOOSE THEIR BEST GOAT_
 Its food for conjecture to judge from the picture
 By Hunt in the Gallery close to our door a
 Man well might suppose that the scapegoat they chose
 Was a long way from being their choicest Angora
 In fact I should think he was one of their weediest
 Tis a rule that obtains no matter who reigns
 When making a sacrifice offer the seediest
 Which accounts for a theory known to my hearers
 Who live in the wild by the wattle beguiled
 That a stag makes quite good enough mutton for shearers
 Be that as it may as each year passed away
 A scapegoat was led to the desert and freighted
 With sin the poor brute must have been overweighted
 And left thereto die as his fancy dictated

     

 The day it has come with trumpet and drum
 With pomp and solemnity fit for the tomb
 They led the old billygoat off to his doom
 On every hand a reverend band
 Prophets and preachers and elders stand
 And the oldest rab_bi_ with a tear in his eye
 Delivers a sermon to all standing by
 We havent his namewhether Cohen or Harris he
 No doubt was the poisonest kind of a Pharisee
 The sermon was marked by a deal of humility
 And pointed the fact with no end of ability
 That being a Gentiles no mark of gentility
 And according to Samuel would certainly dn you well
 Then shedding his coat he approaches the goat
 And while a red fillet he carefully pins on him
 Confesses the whole of the Israelites sins on him
 With this eloquent burst he exhorts the accurst
 Go forth in the desert and perish in woe
 The sins of the people are whiter than snow
 Then signs to his pal for to let the brute go

 The animal freed from all restraint
 Lowered his head made a kind of a feint
 And charged straight at that elderly saint
 So fierce his attack and so very severe it
 Quite floored the Rabbi who ere he could fly
 Was rammed on theno not the backbut just near it
 The scapegoat he snorted and wildly cavorted
 A lighthearted antelope out on the ramp
 Then stopped looked around got the lay of the ground
 And made a beeline back again to the camp
 The elderly priest as he noticed the beast
 So gallantly making his way to the East
 Says he From the tents may I never more roam again
 If that there old billygoat aint going home again
 Hes hurrying too This never will do
 Cant somebody stop him Im all of a stew
 After all our confessions so openly granted
 Hes taking our sins back to where theyre not wanted
 Weve come all this distance salvation to win agog
 If he takes home our sinsitll burst up the Synagogue

 He turned to an Acolyte making his bacca light
 A fleetfooted youth who could run like a crack o light
 Run Abraham run Hunt him over the plain
 And drive back the brute to the desert again
 The Sphinx is awatching the Pyramids frown on you
 From those granite tops forty centries look down on you
 Run Abraham run Ill bet halfacrown on you
 So Abraham ran like a man did he go for him
 But the goat made it clear each time he drew near
 That he had what the racing men call too much toe for him

 The crowd with great eagerness studied the race
 Great Scott isnt Abraham forcing the pace
 And dont the goat spiel It is hard to keep sight on him
 The sins of the Israelites ride mighty light on him
 The scapegoat is leading a furlong or more
 And Abrahams tiringIll lay six to four
 He rolls in his stride hes done theres no question
 But here the old Rabbi brought up a suggestion
 Twas strange that in racing he showed so much cunning
 Its a hard race said he and I think it would be
 A good thing for someone to take up the running
 As soon said as done they started to run
 The priests and the deacons strong runners and weak uns
 All reckoned ere long to come up with the brute
 And so the whole boiling set off in pursuit
 And then it came out as the rabble and rout
 Streamed over the desert with many a shout
 The Rabbi so elderly grave and patrician
 Had been in his hot youth a bold metallician
 And offered in gasps as they merrily spieled
 Any price Abraham Evens the field
 Alas the whole clan they raced and they ran
 And Abraham proved him an eventime man
 But the goat now a speck they could scarce keep their eyes on
 Stretched out in his stride in a style most surprisin
 And vanished ere long oer the distant horizon

 Away in the camp the billstickers tramp
 Is heard as he wanders with paste brush and notices
 And paling and wall he plasters them all
 I wonder hows things gettin on with the goat he says
 Then pulls out his bills Use Solomons Pills
 Great Stoning of Christians To all devout Jews you all
 Must each bring a stoneGreat sport will be shown
 Enormous Attractions And prices as usual
 Roll up to the Hall Wives children and all
 For naught the most delicate feelings to hurt is meant
 Here his eyes opened wide for close by his side
 Was the scapegoat devouring the latest advertisement
 One shriek from him burstYou creature accurst
 And he ran from the spot like one fearing the worst
 His language was chaste as he fled in his haste
 But the goat stayed behind himand scoffed up the paste

 With downcast head and sorrowful tread
 The people came back from the desert in dread
 The goatwas he back there Had anyone heard of him
 In very short order they got plenty word of him
 In fact as they wandered by street lane and hall
 The trail of the serpent was over them all
 A poor little child knocked out stiff in the gutter
 Proclaimed that the scapegoat was bred for a butter
 The billstickers pail told a sorrowful tale
 The scapegoat had licked it as dry as a nail
 He raced through their houses and frightened their spouses
 But his latest achievement most anger arouses
 For while they were searching and scratching their craniums
 One little Ben Ourbed who looked in the flowerbed
 Discovered him eating the Rabbis geraniums


 Moral

 The moral is patent to all the beholders
 Dont shift your own sins on to other folks shoulders
 Be kind to dumb creatures and never abuse them
 Nor curse them nor kick them nor spitefully use them
 Take their lives if needs mustwhen it comes to the worst
 But dont let them perish of hunger or thirst
 Remember no matter how far you may roam
 That dogs goats and chickens its simply the dickens
 Their talent stupendous for getting back home
 Your sins without doubt will aye find you out
 And so will a scapegoat hes bound to achieve it
 But die in the wilderness Dont you believe it




An Evening in Dandaloo



 It was while we held our races
 Hurdles sprints and steeplechases
 Up in Dandaloo
 That a crowd of Sydney stealers
 Jockeys pugilists and spielers
 Brought some horses real heelers
 Came and put us through

 Beat our nags and won our money
 Made the game by no means funny
 Made us rather blue
 When the racing was concluded
 Of our hardearned coin denuded
 Dandaloonies sat and brooded
 There in Dandaloo

     

 Night came down on Johnsons shanty
 Where the grog was no means scanty
 And a tumult grew
 Till some wild excited person
 Galloped down the township cursing
 Sydney push have mobbed Macpherson
 Roll up Dandaloo

 Great St Denis what commotion
 Like the rush of stormy ocean
 Fiery horsemen flew
 Dust and smoke and din and rattle
 Down the street they spurred their cattle
 To the warcry of the battle
 Wade in Dandaloo

 So the boys might have their fight out
 Johnson blew the barroom light out
 Then in haste withdrew
 And in darkness and in doubting
 Raged the conflict and the shouting
 Give the Sydney push a clouting
 Go it Dandaloo

 Jack Macpherson seized a bucket
 Every head he saw he struck it
 Struck in earnest too
 And a man from Lower Wattle
 Whom a shearer tried to throttle
 Hit out freely with a bottle
 There in Dandaloo

 Skin and hair were flying thickly
 When a light was fetched and quickly
 Brought a fact to view
 On the scene of the diversion
 Every single solid person
 Come along to help Macpherson
 _All_ were Dandaloo

 When the list of slain was tabled
 Some were drunk and some disabled
 Still we found it true
 In the darkness and the smother
 Wed been belting one another
 Jack Macpherson bashed his brother
 There in Dandaloo

 So we drank and all departed
 How the mobbing yarn was started
 No one ever knew
 And the stockmen tell the story
 Of that conflict fierce and gory
 How we fought for love and glory
 Up in Dandaloo

 Its a proverb now or near it
 At the races you can hear it
 At the dogfights too
 Every shrieking dancing drover
 As the canines topple over
 Yells applause to Grip or Rover
 Give him Dandaloo

 And the teamster slowly toiling
 Through the deep black country soiling
 Wheels and axles too
 Lays the whip on Spot and Banker
 Rouses Tarboy with a flanker
 Redman Ginger Heave there Yank her
 Wade in Dandaloo




A Ballad of Ducks



 The railway rattled and roared and swung
 With jolting carriage and bumping trucks
 The sun like a billiard red ball hung
 In the Western sky and the tireless tongue
 Of the wildeyed man in the corner told
 This terrible tale of the days of old
 And the party that ought to have kept the ducks

 Well it aint all joy bein on the land
 With an overdraft thatd knock you flat
 And the rabbits have pretty well took command
 But the hardest thing for a man to stand
 Is the feller who says Well I told you so
 You should ha done this way dont you know
 I could lay a bait for a man like that

 The grasshoppers struck us in ninetyone
 And what they leavewell it aint de luxe
 But a growlin faultfindin son of a gun
 Whod lent some money to stock our run
 I said theyd eaten what grass we had
 Says he Your managements very bad
 You had a right to have kept some ducks

 To have kept some ducks And the place was white
 Wherever you went you had to tread
 On grasshoppers guzzlin day and night
 And when with a swoosh they rose in flight
 If you didnt look out for yourself theyd fly
 Like bullets into your open eye
 And knock it out of the back of your head

 There isnt a turkey or goose or swan
 Or a duck that quacks or a hen that clucks
 Can make a difference on a run
 When a grasshopper plague has once begun
 If youd finance us I says Id buy
 Ten thousand emus and have a try
 The job I says is too big for ducks

 You must fetch a duck when you come to stay
 A great big ducka Muscovy toff
 Ready and fit I says for the fray
 And if the grasshoppers come our way
 You turn your duck into the lucerne patch
 And Id be ready to make a match
 That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off

 He came to visit us by and by
 And it just so happened one day in Spring
 A kind of a cloud came over the sky
 A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high
 And nine miles thick and nine hundred wide
 Flyin in regiments side by side
 And eatin up every living thing

 All day long like a shower of rain
 Youd hear em smackin against the wall
 Tap tap tap on the window pane
 And theyd rise and jump at the house again
 Till their crippled carcases piled outside
 But what did it matter if thousands died
 A million wouldnt be missed at all

 We were drinkin grasshoppersso to speak
 Till we skimmed their carcases off the spring
 And they fell so thick in the station creek
 They choked the waterholes all the week
 There was scarcely room for a trout to rise
 And theyd only take artificial flies
 They got so sick of the real thing

 An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags
 When the hoppers rose for their morning flight
 With a flapping noise like a million flags
 And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags
 For theyd fall right into the fire and fry
 Till the cook sat down and began to cry
 And never a duck or a fowl in sight

 We strolled across to the railroad track
 Under a cover beneath some trucks
 I sees a feather and hears a quack
 I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back
 Every duck in the place was there
 No good to them was the open air
 Mister I says Theres your blanky ducks




Tommy Corrigan

 Killed Steeplechasing at Flemington



 You talk of riders on the flat of nerve and pluck and pace
 Not one in fifty has the nerve to ride a steeplechase
 Its right enough while horses pull and take their fences strong
 To rush a flier to the front and bring the field along
 But what about the last halfmile with horses blown and beat
 When every jump means all you know to keep him on his feet

 When any slip means sudden deathwith wife and child to keep
 It needs some nerve to draw the whip and flog him at the leap
 But Corrigan would ride them out by danger undismayed
 He never flinched at fence or wall he never was afraid
 With easy seat and nerve of steel light hand and smiling face
 He held the rushing horses back and made the sluggards race

 He gave the shirkers extra heart he steadied down the rash
 He rode great clumsy boring brutes and chanced a fatal smash
 He got the rushing Wymlet home that never jumped at all
 But clambered over every fence and clouted every wall
 But ah you should have heard the cheers that shook the members stand
 Whenever Tommy Corrigan weighed out to ride Lone Hand

 They were indeed a glorious pairthe great upstanding horse
 The gamest jockey on his back that ever faced a course
 Though weight was big and pace was hot and fences stiff and tall
 You follow Tommy Corrigan was passed to one and all
 And every man on Ballarat raised all he could command
 To put on Tommy Corrigan when riding old Lone Hand

 But now well keep his memory green while horsemen come and go
 We may not see his like again where silks and satins glow
 Well drink to him in silence boyshes followed down the track
 Where many a good man went before but never one came back
 And let us hope in that far land where shades of brave men reign
 That gallant Tommy Corrigan will ride Lone Hand again




The Maoris Wool



 _Now this is just a simple tale to tell the reader how
 They civilised the Maori tribe at Rootiitiau_

     

 The Maoris are a mighty racethe finest ever known
 Before the missionaries came they worshipped wood and stone
 They went to war and fought like fiends and when the war was done
 They pacified their conquered foes by eating every one
 But nowadays about the pahs in idleness they lurk
 Prepared to smoke or drink or talkor anything but work
 The richest tribe in all the North in sheep and horse and cow
 Were those who led their simple lives at Rootiitiau

 Twas down to town at Wellington a noble Maori came
 A Rangatira of the best Rerenga was his name
 The word Rerenga means a snagbut until he was gone
 This didnt strike the folk he metit struck them later on
 He stalked into the Bank they call the Great Financial Hell
 And told the Chief Financial Fiend the tribe had wool to sell
 The Bold Bank Manager looked gravethe price of wool was high
 He said Well lend you what you needwere not disposed to buy
 You ship the wool to England ChiefYoull find its good advice
 And meanwhile you can draw from us the local market price
 The Chief he thanked him courteously and said he wished to state
 In all the Rootiiti tribe his mana would be great
 But still the tribe were simple folk and did not understand
 This strange finance that gave them cash without the wool in hand
 So off he started home again with trouble on his brow
 To lay the case before the tribe at Rootiitiau

 They held a great korero in the Rootiiti clan
 With speeches lasting half a day from every leading man
 They called themselves poetic nameslost children in a wood
 They said the Great Bank Manager was Kapaiextra good
 And so they sent Rerenga down fullpowered and wellequipped
 To draw as much as he could get and let the wool be shipped
 And wedged into a Cargo Tank full up from stern to bow
 A mighty clip of wool went Home from Rootiitiau

 It was the Bold Bank Manager who drew a heavy cheque
 Rerenga cashed it thoughtfully then clasped him round the neck
 A hug from him was not at all a thing youd call a lark
 You see he lived on muttonbirds and dried remains of shark
 But still it showed his gratitude and as he pouched the pelf
 Ill haka for you sir he said in honour of yourself
 The haka is a striking dancethe sort they dont allow
 In any place more civilised than Rootiitiau

 He hakad most effectivelythen with an airy grace
 Rubbed noses with the Manager and vanished into space
 But when the woolreturn came back ah me what sighs and groans
 For every bale of Maori wool was loaded up with stones
 Yesthumping great New Zealand rocks among the wool they found
 On every rock the Bank had lent just seven pence a pound
 And now the Bold Bank Manager with trouble on his brow
 Is searching vainly for the chief from Rootiitiau




The Angels Kiss



 An angel stood beside the bed
 Where lay the living and the dead

 He gave the motherher who died
 A kiss that Christ the Crucified

 Had sent to greet the weary soul
 When worn and faint it reached its goal

 He gave the infant kisses twain
 One on the breast one on the brain

 Go forth into the world he said
 With blessings on your heart and head

 For God who ruleth righteously
 Hath ordered that to such as be

 From birth deprived of mothers love
 I bring His blessing from above

 But if the mothers life He spare
 Then she is made Gods messenger

 To kiss and pray that heart and brain
 May go through life without a stain

 The infant moved towards the light
 The angel spread his wings in flight

 But each man carries to his grave
 The kisses that in hopes to save
 The angel or his mother gave




Sunrise on the Coast



 Grey dawn on the sandhillsthe night wind has drifted
 All night from the rollers a scent of the sea
 With the dawn the grey fog his battalions has lifted
 At the call of the morning they scatter and flee

 Like mariners calling the roll of their number
 The seafowl put out to the infinite deep
 And far overheadsinking softly to slumber
 Worn out by their watching the stars fall asleep

 To eastward where resteth the dome of the skies on
 The sealine stirs softly the curtain of night
 And far from behind the enshrouded horizon
 Comes the voice of a God saying Let there be light

 And lo there is light Evanescent and tender
 It glows rubyred where twas now ashengrey
 And purple and scarlet and gold in its splendour
 Behold tis that marvel the birth of a day




The Reveille



 Trumpets of the Lancer Corps
 Sound a loud reveille
 Sound it over Sydney shore
 Send the message far and wide
 Down the Richmond River side
 Boot and saddle mount and ride
 Sound a loud reveille

 Whither go ye Lancers gay
 With your bold reveille
 Oer the ocean far away
 From your sunny southern home
 Over leagues of trackless foam
 In a foreign land to roam
 With your bold reveille

 When we hear our brethren call
 Sound a clear reveille
 Then we answer one and all
 Answer that the world may see
 Of the English stock are we
 At their side we still will be
 Thats our bold reveille

Notes on the text


An Answer to Various Bards appeared 10 Oct 1892 as one of a series of
poems in the Sydney Bulletin debating what life in the bush was like
or the city versus the bush according to the interpretation
primarily between A B Paterson and Henry Lawson 18671922 who may
have staged the debate as a way of selling more poems

Other writers joined the debate including Edward Dyson 18651931
who despite Patersons remark in this poem also favoured the bush in
at least one poem Another noted participant was Will Ogilvie
18691963 who was in Australia during the 1890s born in Scotland
returned in 1901 and was in Iowa USA from 1905 to 1907

Other verses from the debate maybe found in The Man from Snowy River
by Paterson and In the Days When the World was Wide by Henry Lawson

The second stanza was mistakenly broken into two equal parts in the
original edition


Shouting for a Camel A number of camels were brought to Australia
with their Afghan handlers in order to have suitable beasts of burden
in the desert regions There are still wild camels there today A
similar scheme was tried in America during the 1800s but no camels
remain


 The Gundaroo Bullock

  Said Morgan Tis the carcase of an old man native bear 
 changed to
  Said Morgan Tis the carcase of an old man native bear 


Lay of the MotorCar To put this poem in perspective it must be
remembered that this book was published in 1917 and the poem written
earlier It may be helpful to compare Patersons short story Three
Elephant Power in the book of the same name that was published in the
same year The plot centres around a speed demon who would drive at
unspeakable speeds even up to 45 MPH About 72 KmH


 The Mylora Elopement

  No thought has be but for his prize 
 changed to
  No thought has he but for his prize 


 The Protest

  W ll but I KNOW 
 changed to
  Well but I KNOW 


 The Maoris Wool

  In any place more civilised that Rootiitiau 
 changed to
  In any place more civilised than Rootiitiau 


The Lost Drink The Matrimonial Stakes Not on It The
Scapegoat The Angels Kiss and The Reveille were all dropped from
Saltbush Bill when it was included in Patersons Collected Verse
first issued in 1921 No poems were added though The Song of the
Pen moved from the front of the book to the back and several titles
were slightly changed No effort has been made to compare the texts

There was no Table of Contents in the original trenchedition one was
added

Omitted from the original are the index to Patersons first 3 books
and the frontispiece and vignette by Lionel Lindsay the first of
which was set above the lines

 But when the dawn makes pink the sky
 And steals across the plain
 The Brumby horses turn and fly
 Towards the hills again

which is a misquote of the fourth stanza of Brumbys Run should be
steals along the plain
