INTRODUCTION

Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge as knowledge is of
scepticism To be content with what we at present know is for the
most part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very
gradual character of our education we must continually forget and
emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set
aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must
be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour
and anxiety to acquire

And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which
persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu
of their conventional value The same principles which have swept
away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the
revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from
attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in
society The credulity of one writer or the partiality of another
finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the
healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams
of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the
Church History and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively
recent times are subjected to very different handling from that
which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow Mere
statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form
as important an ingredient in the analysis or his history as the
facts he records Probability is a powerful and troublesome test and
it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical
evidence is sifted Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting
in its demands In brief to write a history we must know more than
mere facts Human nature viewed under an introduction of extended
experience is the best help to the criticism of human history
Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which
human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished To
form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming
parts of a great wholewe must measure them by their relation to the
mass of beings by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the
incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down
to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole
narrative than the respective probability of its details

It is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know
least and talk most Homer Socrates and Shakespere have perhaps
contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than
any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of
all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which
has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or
theories we will follow The personality of Shakespere is perhaps
the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without
controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of
plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty Of Socrates we
know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow
us to know He was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as
unlike in principles as in style He appears as the enunciator of
opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have
handed them down When we have read Plato or Xenophon we think we
know something of Socrates when we have fairly read and examined
both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant

It has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny
the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and
condition were too much for our belief This systemwhich has often
comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of
Strauss for those of the New Testamenthas been of incalculable
value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries
To question the existence of Alexander the Great would be a more
excusable act than to believe in that of Romulus To deny a fact
related in Herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory
developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in
the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the goodnatured
old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealizedNuma
Pompilius

Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer
and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free
permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all
written tradition concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and
Odyssey What few authorities exist on the subject are summarily
dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle This
cannot be true because it is not true and that is not true because
it cannot be true Such seems to be the style in which testimony
upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and
oblivion

It is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer
are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in
which truth is the requisite most wanting Before taking a brief
review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions some notice
must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been
attributed to Herodotus

According to this document the city of Cumae in AEolia was at an
early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of
Greece Among the immigrants was Menapolus the son of Ithagenes
Although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl
named Critheis The girl was left an orphan at an early age under
the guardianship of Cleanax of Argos It is to the indiscretion of
this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness Homer was
the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of
Melesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in Boeotia
whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her
reputation

At this time continues our narrative there lived at Smyrna a man
named Phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being
married engaged Critheis to manage his household and spin the flax
he received as the price of his scholastic labours So satisfactory
was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he
made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further
inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become
a clever man if he were carefully brought up

They were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which
nature had bestowed and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows
in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in
wisdom Phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his
mother soon followed Melesigenes carried on his adopted fathers
school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the
inhabitants of Smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade
carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to
that city Among these visitors one Mentes from Leucadia the
modern Santa Maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely
found in those times persuaded Melesigenes to close his school and
accompany him on his travels He promised not only to pay his
expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that
While he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his
own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the
subjects of his discourses Melesigenes consented and set out with
his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they
visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those
whom he met We may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that
he deemed worthy of preservation Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and
Iberia they reached Ithaca Here Melesigenes who had already
suffered in his eyes became much worse and Mentes who was about to
leave for Leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a
friend of his named Mentor the son of Alcinor Under his hospitable
and intelligent host Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the
legends respecting Ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of
the Odyssey The inhabitants of Ithaca assert that it was here that
Melesigenes became blind but the Colophonians make their city the
seat of that misfortune He then returned to Smyrna where he
applied himself to the study of poetry

But poverty soon drove him to Cumae Having passed over the Hermaean
plain he arrived at Neon Teichos the New Wall a colony of Cumae
Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of
one Tychias an armourer And up to my time continues the author
the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot Here
also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since
Melesigenes arrived

But poverty still drove him on and he went by way of Larissa as
being the most convenient road Here the Cumans say he composed an
epitaph on Gordius king of Phrygia which has however and with
greater probability been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus

Arrived at Cumae he frequented the conversaziones of the old men
and delighted all by the charms of his poetry Encouraged by this
favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a
public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously
renowned They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure
he proposed and procured him an audience in the council Having made
the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to
acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the
answer to be given to his proposal

The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poets
demand but one man observed that if they were to feed Homers they
would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people From this
circumstance says the writer Melesigenes acquired the name of
Homer for the Cumans call blind men Homers With a love of economy
which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of
literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his
disappointment in a wish that Cumae might never produce a poet
capable of giving it renown and glory

At Phocaea Homer was destined to experience another literary
distress One Thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical
genius kept Homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on
condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name Having
collected sufficient poetry to be profitable Thestorides like some
wouldbe literary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had
sucked and left him At his departure Homer is said to have
observed O Thestorides of the many things hidden from the
knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than the human
heart

Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some
Chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard
him recite acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was
pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same
poems This at once determined him to set out for Chios No vessel
happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to
start for Erythrae a town of Ionia which faces that island and he
prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them Having
embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be
able to expose the imposture of Thestorides who by his breach of
hospitality had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable

At Erythrae Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in
Phocaea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty
reached the little hamlet of Pithys Here he met with an adventure
which we will continue in the words of our author Having set out
from Pithys Homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that
were pasturing The dogs barked on his approach and he cried out
Glaucus for that was the name of the goatherd heard his voice ran
up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from Homer For
some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such
a place alone and what could be his design in coming He then went
up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate
places and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need Homer by
recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him
with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having
lit a fire bade him sup

The dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according
to their usual habit Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus O
Glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest First give the dogs
their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since
whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold

Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author
Having finished supper they banqueted afresh on conversation Homer
narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited

At length they retired to rest but on the following morning
Glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his
meeting with Homer Having left the goats in charge of a
fellowservant he left Homer at home promising to return quickly
Having arrived at Bolissus a place near the farm and finding his
mate he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey
He paid little attention to what he said and blamed Glaucus for his
stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons
However he bade him bring the stranger to him

Glaucus told Homer what had taken place and bade him follow him
assuring him that good fortune would be the result Conversation soon
showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general
knowledge and the Chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake
the charge of his children

Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
island Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher In the town
of Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of
poetry To this day says Chandler the most curious remain is
that which has been named without reason the School of Homer It is
on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears
to have been an open temple of Cybele formed on the top of a rock
The shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the
head and an arm wanting She is represented as usual sitting The
chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back The area is
bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over The whole
is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the
most remote antiquity

So successful was this school that Homer realised a considerable
fortune He married and had two daughters one of whom died single
the other married a Chian

The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the
personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has
already been mentioned

In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
Mentor of Ithaca in the Odyssey whose name he has inserted in his
poem as the companion of Ulysses in return for the care taken of him
when afflicted with blindness He also testifies his gratitude to
Phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction

His celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to
visit Greece whither his reputation had now extended Having it is
said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the
vanity of the Athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no
mention he set out for Samos Here being recognized by a Samian
who had met with him in Chios he was handsomely received and
invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian festival He recited
some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the
Eiresione at the New Moon festivals he earned a subsistence
visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very
popular

In the spring he sailed for Athens and arrived at the island of Ios
now Ino where he fell extremely ill and died It is said that his
death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an
enigma proposed by some fishermens children

Such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of Homer we
possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical
worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in
detail Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a
persevering patient and learnedbut by no means consistentseries
of investigations has led In doing so I profess to bring forward
statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability

Homer appeared The history of this poet and his works is lost in
doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who
have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness The
majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the
Nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the
Nile its fountains will ever remain concealed

Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics
has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the
Homeric question is involved With no less truth and feeling he
proceeds

It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature
of things makes possible If the period of tradition in history is
the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light The
creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for
the most part created far out of the reach of observation If we
were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could
wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey for their
origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the
poet

From this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of
human nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic
investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue Was
Homer an individual or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an
ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets

Well has Landor remarked Some tell us there were twenty Homers
some deny that there was ever one It were idle and foolish to shake
the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last We are
perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our
devotion to superior power Of all the animals on earth we least know
what is good for us My opinion is that what is best for us is our
admiration of good No man living venerates Homer more than I do

But greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests
contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been
nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of
first impressions by minute analysis our editorial office compels us
to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the
Homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief
period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend
to dry details Before however entering into particulars respecting
the question of this unity of the Homeric poems at least of the
Iliad I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in
the following remarks

We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the
better the poetic age of Greece almost conclusive testimony to its
original composition It was not till the age of the grammarians that
its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice
to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is
not the best qualification for the profound feeling the
comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole The most exquisite
anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we
would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions
and general beauty of a form rather than that of Mr Brodie or Sir
Astley Cooper

There is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the lines
of Pope

 The critic eyethat microscope of wit
 Sees hairs and pores examines bit by bit
 How parts relate to parts or they to whole
 The bodys harmony the beaming soul
 Are things which Kuster Burmann Wasse shall see
 When mans whole frame is obvious to a flea

Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning
the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems The grave and
cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo the
authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics
Longinus in an oftquoted passage merely expressed an opinion
touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad
and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names it would be
tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of
Homer ever arose So far the voice of antiquity seems to be in
favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the
discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim

At the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on
the subject and we find Bentley remarking that Homer wrote a sequel
of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and
good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment These loose
songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till
about Peisistratus time about five hundred years after

Two French writersHedelin and Perraultavowed a similar scepticism
on the subject but it is in the Scienza Nuova of Battista Vico
that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended
by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness Indeed it is with the
Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following
bold hypothesis which we will detail in the words of Grote

Half a century ago the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F A
Wolf turning to account the Venetian Scholia which had then been
recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the
history of the Homeric text A considerable part of that dissertation
though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the
position previously announced by Bentley amongst others that the
separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been
cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until
the days of Peisistratus in the sixth century before Christ As a
step towards that conclusion Wolf maintained that no written copies
of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier
times to which their composition is referred and that without
writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could
have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him
transmitted with assurance to posterity The absence of easy and
convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long
manuscripts among the early Greeks was thus one of the points in
Wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
By Nitzsch and other leading opponents of Wolf the connection of
the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally
put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended
the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey to maintain
that they were written poems from the beginning

To me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf
to Peisistratus and his associates in reference to the Homeric
poems are nowise admissible But much would undoubtedly be gained
towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in
order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting
long written poems in the ninth century before the Christian aera
Few things in my opinion can be more improbable and Mr Payne
Knight opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis admits this no
less than Wolf himself The traces of writing in Greece even in the
seventh century before the Christian aera are exceedingly trifling
We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad
and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can
we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus Simonides of Amorgus
Kallinus Tyrtaeus Xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric
poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the
practice of doing so became familiar The first positive ground which
authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer is
in the famous ordinance of Solon with regard to the rhapsodies at
the Panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts
had existed we are unable to say

Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the
existing habits of society with regard to poetryfor they admit
generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read but recited and
heardbut upon the supposed necessity that there must have been
manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poemsthe unassisted
memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy But here
we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the
existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory is far
less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially
nonreading and nonwriting and when even suitable instruments and
materials for the process are not obvious Moreover there is a strong
positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of
refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been
the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the
profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of
Demodokus in the Odyssey as from that of the blind bard of Chios in
the Hymn to the Delian Apollo whom Thucydides as well as the general
tenor of Grecian legend identifies with Homer himself The author of
that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as
attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious
that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference
to the manuscript in his chest

The loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon
which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove
beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the Greek language had
undergone a considerable change Now it is certainly difficult to
suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change
had written copies been preserved If Chaucers poetry for instance
had not been written it could only have come down to us in a
softened form more like the effeminate version of Dryden than the
rough quaint noble original At what period continues Grote
these poems or indeed any other Greek poems first began to be
written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for
assurance that it was before the time of Solon If in the absence of
evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the
question at once suggests itself What were the purposes which in
that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must
have been intended to answer For whom was a written Iliad necessary
Not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the
memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in
conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses
and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery
and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce Not for the
general publicthey were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic
delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded
festival The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be
suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of
readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the
written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of
the impression communicated by the reciter Incredible as the
statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early
societies and there was in early Greece a time when no such reading
class existed If we could discover at what time such a class first
began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time
when the old epic poems were first committed to writing Now the
period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as
having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading
class in Greece is the middle of the seventh century before the
Christian aera BC 660 to BC 630 the age of Terpander
Kallinus Archilochus Simenides of Amorgus c I ground this
supposition on the change then operated in the character and
tendencies of Grecian poetry and musicthe elegiac and the iambic
measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter
and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical
past to the affairs of present and real life Such a change was
important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet the
nearest approaching to the sense It argued a new way of looking at
the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be
considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from
their own individual point of view the written words of the Homeric
rhapsodies just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and
eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer There seems
therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this
newlyformed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of
the Homeric poems and other old epicsthe Thebais and the Cypria
as well as the Iliad and the Odysseybegan to be compiled towards
the middle of the seventh century BC I and the opening of Egypt to
Grecian commerce which took place about the same period would
furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to
write upon A reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly
increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before
the time of Solon fifty years afterwards both readers and
manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a
certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference
against the carelessness of individual rhapsodies

But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession
of the credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
observations

There are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion
throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
compilation at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into
its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the
Athenian ruler If the great poets who flourished at the bright
period of Grecian song of which alas we have inherited little more
than the fame and the faint echo if Stesichorus Anacreon and
Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and
Odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to
harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of
Athenian manufacture should not remain Whatever occasional anomalies
may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own
ignorance of the language of the Homeric age however the irregular
use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys to whom the name
of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the
fair one herself among the heroes of her age however Mr Knight may
have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form
however finally the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more
marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to
suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and
transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the
incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression
It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique
style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of
the original as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir
Tristram

If however not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian
compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total
absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of
observation In later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier
times the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of
their ancestors But amid all the traditions of the glories of early
Greece embodied in the Iliad the Athenians play a most subordinate
and insignificant part Even the few passages which relate to their
ancestors Mr Knight suspects to be interpolations It is possible
indeed that in its leading outline the Iliad may be true to
historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western
Greece against the rival and halfkindred empire of the
Laomedontiadae the chieftain of Thessaly from his valour and the
number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the
Peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry
on the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the
Athenians to yield to their taste The songs which spoke of their own
great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and
popularity or at first sight a Theseid would have been much more
likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers of
ancient song than an Achilleid or an Odysseid Could France have
given birth to a Tasso Tancred would have been the hero of the
Jerusalem If however the Homeric ballads as they are sometimes
called which related the wrath of Achilles with all its direful
consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle
as to admit no rivalryit is still surprising that throughout the
whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship
of an Athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have
at a later period not inaptly been compared to our selfadmiring
neighbours the French should submit with lofty selfdenial to the
almost total exclusion of their own ancestorsor at least to the
questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably
skilled in the military tactics of his age

To return to the Wolfian theory While it is to be confessed that
Wolfs objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
have never been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they
have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the
difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather
augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis Nor is
Lachmanns modification of his theory any better He divides the
first twentytwo books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs and
treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one
regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of
Peisistratus This as Grote observes explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else
Moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the
socalled sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following
leading men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles
Elphenor chief of the Euboeans Tlepolemus of the Rhodians
Pandarus of the Lycians Odins of the Halizonians Pirous and
Acamas of the Thracians None of these heroes again make their
appearance and we can but agree with Colonel Mure that it seems
strange that any number of independent poets should have so
harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel
The discrepancy by which Pylaemenes who is represented as dead in
the fifth book weeps at his sons funeral in the thirteenth can
only be regarded as the result of an interpolation

Grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the
subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian
theory and of Lachmanns modifications with the character of
Peisistratus But he has also shown and we think with equal success
that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these
poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by
Peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct In
short a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of
preexisting songs without recognising the age of Peisistratus as
the period of its first compilation The friends or literary
employes of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already
ancient and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the
Peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous
manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought
unworthy of attention

Moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves
confirms what is here remarked There is nothing either in the Iliad
or Odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age
of Peisistratusnothing which brings to our view the alterations
brought about by two centuries in the Greek language the coined
money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and
republican governments the close military array the improved
construction of ships the Amphiktyonic convocations the mutual
frequentation of religious festivals the Oriental and Egyptian veins
of religion c familiar to the latter epoch These alterations
Onomakritus and the other literary friends of Peisistratus could
hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for
the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many
selfexistent epics into one large aggregate Everything in the two
great Homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an
age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus Indeed even
the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are
pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before
Christ and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinusin
some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiodas genuine Homeric matter As
far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external
enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and
Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing
for partial divergences of text and interpolations in 776 BC our
first trustworthy mark of Grecian time and this ancient date let it
be added as it is the bestauthenticated fact so it is also the
most important attribute of the Homeric poems considered in
reference to Grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into
the antihistorical character of the Greeks enabling us to trace the
subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive
contrasts between their former and their later condition

On the whole I am inclined to believe that the labours of
Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although I must
confess that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his
labours At the same time so far from believing that the composition
or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the
work of Peisistratus I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and
elegant mind of that Athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient
and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and
reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis I will not
repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written
or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their
reputed author Suffice it to say that the more we read the less
satisfied we are upon either subject

I cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the
preservation of these poems to Lycurgus is little else than a
version of the same story as that of Peisistratus while its
historical probability must be measured by that of many others
relating to the Spartan Confucius

I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt
made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like
consistency It is as follows

No doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common
sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse in
excellent music among them Many of these like those of the negroes
in the United States were extemporaneous and allusive to events
passing around them But what was passing around them The grand
events of a spiritstirring war occurrences likely to impress
themselves as the mystical legends of former times had done upon
their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue
of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient
times Ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with
Troy were merely recitations with an intonation Then followed a
species of recitative probably with an intoned burden Tune next
followed as it aided the memory considerably

It was at this period about four hundred years after the war that
a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes or Moeonides but most
probably the former He saw that these ballads might be made of great
utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
Hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them
by a tale of his own This poem now exists under the title of the
Odyssea The author however did not affix his own name to the
poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the
archaic dialect of Crete in which tongue the ballads were found by
him He therefore called it the poem of Homeros or the Collector
but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his
mere drudging arrangement of other peoples ideas for as Grote has
finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet
might have recast preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive
whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do
so

While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus he met with a ballad
recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon His noble mind
seized the hint that there presented itself and the Achilleis grew
under his hand Unity of design however caused him to publish the
poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed
lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating
to the Cid into a chronicle history named the Iliad Melesigenes
knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has
proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many
vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them
in the streets assemblies and agoras However Solon first and
then Peisistratus and afterwards Aristoteles and others revised the
poems and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their
original integrity in a great measure

Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which
have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject I
must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of
the Homeric poems To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may
here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the
negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious
assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if
we would either understand or enjoy these poems In maintaining the
authenticity and personality of their one author be he Homer or
Melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit I feel
conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is
against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a
plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that
which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the
soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary

The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise
Indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an
attempt would be gross inconsistency But while I appreciate its
importance in a philological view I am inclined to set little store
on its aesthetic value especially in poetry Three parts of the
emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had
they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus he
would probably have adopted Moreover those who are most exact in
laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often
least competent to carry out their own precepts Grammarians are not
poets by profession but may be so per accidens I do not at this
moment remember two emendations on Homer calculated to substantially
improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from
Herodotus down to Loewe have given us the history of a thousand
minute points without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and
jejune

But it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will
exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity Binding down
an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have
previously dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the
axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in
everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation
they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author
is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied
they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been
put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand If we compare
the theories of Knight Wolf Lachmann and others we shall feel
better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the
apocryphal position of Homer One rejects what another considers the
turningpoint of his theory One cuts a supposed knot by expunging
what another would explain by omitting something else

Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon
as a literary novelty Justus Lipsius a scholar of no ordinary
skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies
attributed to Seneca are by four different authors Now I will
venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in
their borrowed phraseologya phraseology with which writers like
Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselvesin
their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an
ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few
writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the
same gentleman be he Seneca or not to produce not only these but a
great many more equally bad With equal sagacity Father Hardouin
astonished the world with the startling announcement that the AEneid
of Virgil and the satires of Horace were literary deceptions Now
without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry
and learningnay the refined acutenesswhich scholars like Wolf
have bestowed upon this subject I must express my fears that many
of our modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise
and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity Nor can
I help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will
account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the
Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first
creation

I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus
were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason
why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad
in his day than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus
should have given so much trouble to Poggio Scaliger and others
But after all the main fault in all the Homeric theories is that
they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry
most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges The
ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of
Homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our
whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of
Chios To believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler is to
degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment
at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to
forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus There is a
catholicity so to speak in the very name of Homer Our faith in the
author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has
taught us a better

While however I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has
nature herself for its mainspring while I can join with old Ennius
in believing in Homer as the ghost who like some patron saint
hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from
that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not
exhauststill I am far from wishing to deny that the author of
these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a wellstocked
mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and
embellishment But it is one thing to use existing romances in the
embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from
such materials What consistency of style and execution can be hoped
for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will
not be the infallible result

A blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other
bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality
In fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward
impressionsnay even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary
agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination But unless
there be some grand pervading principlesome invisible yet most
distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the
Iliad can never come to the birth Traditions the most picturesque
episodes the most pathetic local associations teeming with the
thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or
reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet
but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall
be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have
nought but a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds
strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento
of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect

Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and
aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my
belief it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is
reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained We are
not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the
powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at
our disposal Were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why
God willed our ignorance on any matter But we are too well taught
the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be
especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought
most influence upon the condition of humanity And there is a kind of
sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which
seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their
existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of
intellect by an homaeopathic dynameter

Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our
thoughts even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right
spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled
too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the
minute spots which mere analysis can discover In reading an heroic
poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we
in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves
burn with the same sense of injury as an Achilles or a Hector And
if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm
will scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer we shall feel that
the poems of Homer are not only the work of one writer but of the
greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of
song

And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems
their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old Heeren
who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely
observes

It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation No poet
has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his
countrymen Prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character
of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the
Greeks This is a feature in their character which was not wholly
erased even in the period of their degeneracy When lawgivers and
sages appeared in Greece the work of the poet had already been
accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius He held up
before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world
of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold
them reflected with purity and truth His poems are founded on the
first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and
country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of
glory His songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized
with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will
continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies
If it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any
of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the
nations from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia
performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to
flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand
of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into
being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside
this alone would suffice to complete his happiness

Can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the Apotheosis of
Homer is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association
how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds
is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition The
more we read and the more we thinkthink as becomes the readers of
Homerthe more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of
Poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire Whatever were
the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the
treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek
to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories
whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each
other

As the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer are not
included in Popes translation I will content myself with a brief
account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice from the pen of a writer
who has done it full justice

This poem says Coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient date
The text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and
corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a
juvenile essay of Homers genius others have attributed it to the
same Pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems
to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the
author of which was uncertain so little did the Greeks before the
age of the Ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism
employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings As to
this little poem being a youthful prolusion of Homer it seems
sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain
and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of numerous
passages of the Iliad itself and even if no such intention to
parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that
to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of
poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the
development of national taste which the history of every other
people in Europe and of many in Asia has almost ascertained to be a
law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined
and permanent than that described in the Iliad that any popularity
would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in
this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of
the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason
to Homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of
the Homeric age Knight infers from the usage of the word deltoz
writing tablet instead of diphthera skin which according to
Herod 5 58 was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that
purpose that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity and
generally that the familiar mention of the cock v 191 is a strong
argument against so ancient a date for its composition

Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Popes
design I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation
and on my own purpose in the present edition

Pope was not a Grecian His whole education had been irregular and
his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of
Ogilby It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the
impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense
rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of
language Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an
elegant paraphrase than a translation There are to be sure certain
conventional anecdotes which prove that Pope consulted various
friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own
during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations
were the result rather of the contradictory versions already
existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the
original And in those days what is called literal translation was
less cultivated than at present If something like the general sense
could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if
the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made
consistent with a fair interpretation of the poets meaning his
words were less jealously sought for and those who could read so
good a poem as Popes Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied

It would be absurd therefore to test Popes translation by our own
advancing knowledge of the original text We must be content to look
at it as a most delightful work in itselfa work which is as much a
part of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek We must not
be torn from our kindly associations with the old Iliad that once
was our most cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize
merely because Buttmann Loewe and Liddell have made us so much more
accurate as to amphikipellon being an adjective and not a
substantive Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope
especially when we think of Chapmans fine bold rough old
Englishfar be it from us to hold up his translation as what a
translation of Homer might be But we can still dismiss Popes Iliad
to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must
have read a very great number of books before they have read its
fellow

THE ODYSSEY OF HOMER

BOOK I

ARGUMENT

MINERVAS DESCENT TO ITHACA

The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses
in his dominions He had now remained seven years in the Island of
Calypso when the gods assembled in council proposed the method
of his departure from thence and his return to his native country
For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso and
Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca She holds a conference with
Telemachus in the shape of Mantes king of Taphians in which she
advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses to
Pylos and Sparta where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned then
after having visibly displayed her divinity disappears The
suitors of Penelope make great entertainments and riot in her
palace till night Phemius sings to them the return of the
Grecians till Penelope puts a stop to the song Some words arise
between the suitors and Telemachus who summons the council to
meet the day following



The man for wisdoms various arts renownd
Long exercised in woes O Muse resound
Who when his arms had wrought the destined fall
Of sacred Troy and razed her heavenbuilt wall
Wandering from clime to clime observant strayd
Their manners noted and their states surveyd
On stormy seas unnumberd toils he bore
Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore
Vain toils their impious folly dared to prey
On herds devoted to the god of day
The god vindictive doomd them never more
Ah men unblessd to touch that natal shore
Oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate
Celestial Muse and to our world relate

Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived
All who the wars of ten long years survived
And scaped the perils of the gulfy main
Ulysses sole of all the victor train
An exile from his dear paternal coast
Deplored his absent queen and empire lost
Calypso in her caves constraind his stay
With sweet reluctant amorous delay
In vainfor now the circling years disclose
The day predestined to reward his woes
At length his Ithaca is given by fate
Where yet new labours his arrival wait
At length their rage the hostile powers restrain
All but the ruthless monarch of the main
But now the god remote a heavenly guest
In AEthiopia graced the genial feast
A race divided whom with sloping rays
The rising and descending sun surveys
There on the worlds extremest verge revered
With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferrd
Distant he lay while in the bright abodes
Of high Olympus Jove convened the gods
The assembly thus the sire supreme addressd
AEgysthus fate revolving in his breast
Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast
Of Pluto sent a bloodpolluted ghost

Perverse mankind whose wills created free
Charge all their woes on absolute degree
All to the dooming gods their guilt translate
And follies are miscalld the crimes of fate
When to his lust AEgysthus gave the rein
Did fate or we the adulterous act constrain
Did fate or we when great Atrides died
Urge the bold traitor to the regicide
Hermes I sent while yet his soul remaind
Sincere from royal blood and faith profaned
To warn the wretch that young Orestes grown
To manly years should reassert the throne
Yet impotent of mind and uncontrolld
He plunged into the gulf which Heaven foretold

Here paused the god and pensive thus replies
Minerva graceful with her azure eyes

O thou from whom the whole creation springs
The source of power on earth derived to kings
His death was equal to the direful deed
So may the man of blood be doomed to bleed
But grief and rage alternate wound my breast
For brave Ulysses still by fate oppressd
Amidst an isle around whose rocky shore
The forests murmur and the surges roar
The blameless hero from his wishdfor home
A goddess guards in her enchanted dome
Atlas her sire to whose farpiercing eye
The wonders of the deep expanded lie
The eternal columns which on earth he rears
End in the starry vault and prop the spheres
By his fair daughter is the chief confined
Who soothes to dear delight his anxious mind
Successless all her soft caresses prove
To banish from his breast his countrys love
To see the smoke from his loved palace rise
While the dear isle in distant prospect lies
With what contentment could he close his eyes
And will Omnipotence neglect to save
The suffering virtue of the wise and brave
Must he whose altars on the Phrygian shore
With frequent rites and pure avowd thy power
Be doomd the worst of human ills to prove
Unblessd abandond to the wrath of Jove

Daughter what words have passd thy lips unweighd
Replied the Thunderer to the martial maid
Deem not unjustly by my doom oppressd
Of human race the wisest and the best
Neptune by prayer repentant rarely won
Afflicts the chief to avenge his giant son
Whose visual orb Ulysses robbd of light
Great Polypheme of more than mortal might
Him young Thousa bore the bright increase
Of Phorcys dreaded in the sounds and seas
Whom Neptune eyed with bloom of beauty blessd
And in his cave the yielding nymph compressd
For this the god constrains the Greek to roam
A hopeless exile from his native home
From death alone exemptbut cease to mourn
Let all combine to achieve his wishd return
Neptune atoned his wrath shall now refrain
Or thwart the synod of the gods in vain

Father and king adored Minerva cried
Since all who in the Olympian bower reside
Now make the wandering Greek their public care
Let Hermes to the Atlantic isle repair
Bid him arrived in bright Calypsos court
The sanction of the assembled powers report
That wise Ulysses to his native land
Must speed obedient to their high command
Meantime Telemachus the blooming heir
Of seagirt Ithaca demands my care
Tis mine to form his green unpractised years
In sage debates surrounded with his peers
To save the state and timely to restrain
The bold intrusion of the suitortrain
Who crowd his palace and with lawless power
His herds and flocks in feastful rites devour
To distant Sparta and the spacious waste
Of Sandy Pyle the royal youth shall haste
There warm with filial love the cause inquire
That from his realm retards his godlike sire
Delivering early to the voice of fame
The promise of a green immortal name

She said the sandals of celestial mould
Fledged with ambrosial plumes and rich with gold
Surround her feet with these sublime she sails
The aerial space and mounts the winged gales
Oer earth and ocean wide prepared to soar
Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore
Ponderous and vast which when her fury burns
Proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns
From high Olympus prone her flight she bends
And in the realms of Ithaca descends
Her lineaments divine the grave disguise
Of Mentes form conceald from human eyes
Mentes the monarch of the Taphian land
A glittering spear waved awful in her hand
There in the portal placed the heavenborn maid
Enormous riot and misrule surveyd
On hides of beeves before the palace gate
Sad spoils of luxury the suitors sate
With rival art and ardour in their mien
At chess they vie to captivate the queen
Divining of their loves Attending nigh
A menial train the flowing bowl supply
Others apart the spacious hall prepare
And form the costly feast with busy care
There young Telemachus his bloomy face
Glowing celestial sweet with godlike grace
Amid the circle shines but hope and fear
Painful vicissitude his bosom tear
Now imaged in his mind he sees restored
In peace and joy the peoples rightful lord
The proud oppressors fly the vengeful sword
While his fond soul these fancied triumphs swelld
The stranger guest the royal youth beheld
Grieved that a visitant so long should wait
Unmarkd unhonourd at a monarchs gate
Instant he flew with hospitable haste
And the new friend with courteous air embraced
Stranger whoeer thou art securely rest
Affianced in my faith a ready guest
Approach the dome the social banquet share
And then the purpose of thy soul declare

Thus affable and mild the prince precedes
And to the dome the unknown celestial leads
The spear receiving from the hand he placed
Against a column fair with sculpture graced
Where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood
Ulysses arms now long disused to blood
He led the goddess to the sovereign seat
Her feet supported with a stool of state
A purple carpet spread the pavement wide
Then drew his seat familiar to her side
Far from the suitortrain a brutal crowd
With insolence and wine elate and loud
Where the free guest unnoted might relate
If haply conscious of his fathers fate
The golden ewer a maid obsequious brings
Replenishd from the cool translucent springs
With copious water the bright vase supplies
A silver laver of capacious size
They wash The tables in fair order spread
They heap the glittering canisters with bread
Viands of various kinds allure the taste
Of choicest sort and savour rich repast
Delicious wines the attending herald brought
The gold gave lustre to the purple draught
Lured with the vapour of the fragrant feast
In rushd the suitors with voracious haste
Marshalld in order due to each a sewer
Presents to bathe his hands a radiant ewer
Luxurious then they feast Observant round
Gay stripling youths the brimming goblets crownd
The rage of hunger quelld they all advance
And form to measured airs the mazy dance
To Phemius was consignd the chorded lyre
Whose hand reluctant touchd the warbling wire
Phemius whose voice divine could sweetest sing
High strains responsive to the vocal string

Meanwhile in whispers to his heavenly guest
His indignation thus the prince expressd

Indulge my rising grief whilst these my friend
With song and dance the pompous revel end
Light is the dance and doubly sweet the lays
When for the dear delight another pays
His treasured stores those cormarants consume
Whose bones defrauded of a regal tomb
And common turf lie naked on the plain
Or doomd to welter in the whelming main
Should he return that troop so blithe and bold
With purple robes inwrought and stiff with gold
Precipitant in fear would wing their flight
And curse their cumbrous prides unwieldy weight
But ah I dreamthe appointed hour is fled
And hope too long with vain delusion fed
Deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame
Gives to the roll of death his glorious name
With venial freedom let me now demand
Thy name thy lineage and paternal land
Sincere from whence began thy course recite
And to what ship I owe the friendly freight
Now first to me this visit dost thou deign
Or numberd in my fathers social train
All who deserved his choice he made his own
And curious much to know he far was known

My birth I boast the blueeyed virgin cries
From great Anchialus renownd and wise
Mentes my name I rule the Taphian race
Whose bounds the deep circumfluent waves embrace
A duteous people and industrious isle
To naval arts inured and stormy toil
Freighted with iron from my native land
I steer my voyage to the Brutian strand
To gain by commerce for the labourd mass
A just proportion of refulgent brass
Far from your capital my ship resides
At Reitorus and secure at anchor rides
Where waving groves on airy Neign grow
Supremely tall and shade the deeps below
Thence to revisit your imperial dome
An old hereditary guest I come
Your fathers friend Laertes can relate
Our faith unspotted and its early date
Who pressd with heartcorroding grief and years
To the gay court a rural shed pretors
Where sole of all his train a matron sage
Supports with homely fond his drooping age
With feeble steps from marshalling his vines
Returning sad when toilsome day declines

With friendly speed induced by erring fame
To hail Ulysses safe return I came
But still the frown of some celestial power
With envious joy retards the blissful hour
Let not your soul be sunk in sad despair
He lives he breathes this heavenly vital air
Among a savage race whose shelfy bounds
With ceaseless roar the foaming deep surrounds
The thoughts which roll within my ravishd breast
To me no seer the inspiring gods suggest
Nor skilld nor studious with prophetic eye
To judge the winged omens of the sky
Yet hear this certain speech nor deem it vain
Though adamantine bonds the chief restrain
The dire restraint his wisdom will defeat
And soon restore him to his regal seat
But generous youth sincere and free declare
Are you of manly growth his royal heir
For sure Ulysses in your look appears
The same his features if the same his years
Such was that face on which I dwelt with joy
Ere Greece assembled stemmd the tides to Troy
But parting then for that detested shore
Our eyes unhappy never greeted more

To prove a genuine birth the prince replies
On female truth assenting faith relies
Thus manifest of right I build my claim
Surefounded on a fair maternal fame
Ulysses son but happier he whom fate
Hath placed beneath the storms which toss the great
Happier the son whose hoary sire is blessd
With humble affluence and domestic rest
Happier than I to future empire born
But doomd a fathers wretchd fate to mourn

To whom with aspect mild the guest divine
Oh true descendant of a sceptred line
The gods a glorious fate from anguish free
To chaste Penelopes increase decree
But say yon jovial troops so gaily dressd
Is this a bridal or a friendly feast
Or from their deed I rightlier may divine
Unseemly flown with insolence and wine
Unwelcome revellers whose lawless joy
Pains the sage ear and hurts the sober eye

Magnificence of old the prince replied
Beneath our roof with virtue could reside
Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board
What time this dome revered her prudent lord
Who now so Heaven decrees is doomd to mourn
Bitter constraint erroneous and forlorn
Better the chief on Ilions hostile plain
Had falln surrounded with his warlike train
Or safe returnd the race of glory passd
New to his friends embrace and breathed his last
Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes would raise
Historic marbles to record his praise
His praise eternal on the faithful stone
Had with transmissive honour graced his son
Now snatchd by harpies to the dreary coast
Sunk is the hero and his glory lost
Vanishd at once unheard of and unknown
And I his heir in misery alone
Nor for a dear lost father only flow
The filial tears but woe succeeds to woe
To tempt the spouseless queen with amorous wiles
Resort the nobles from the neighbouring isles
From Samos circled with the Ionian main
Dulichium and Zacynthas sylvan reign
Evn with presumptuous hope her bed to ascend
The lords of Ithaca their right pretend
She seems attentive to their pleaded vows
Her heart detesting what her ear allows
They vain expectants of the bridal hour
My stores in riotous expense devour
In feast and dance the mirthful months employ
And meditate my doom to crown their joy

With tender pity touchd the goddess cried
Soon may kind Heaven a sure relief provide
Soon may your sire discharge the vengeance due
And all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue
Oh in that portal should the chief appear
Each hand tremendous with a brazen spear
In radiant panoply his limbs incased
For so of old my fathers court he graced
When social mirth unbent his serious soul
Oer the full banquet and the sprightly bowl
He then from Ephyre the fair domain
Of Ilus sprung from Jasons royal strain
Measured a length of seas a toilsome length in vain
For voyaging to learn the direful art
To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart
Observant of the gods and sternly just
Ilus refused to impart the baneful trust
With friendlier zeal my fathers soul was fired
The drugs he knew and gave the boon desired
Appeard he now with such heroic port
As then conspicuous at the Taphian court
Soon should you boasters cease their haughty strife
Or each atone his guilty love with life
But of his wishd return the care resign
Be future vengeance to the powers divine
My sentence hear with stern distaste avowd
To their own districts drive the suitorcrowd
When next the morning warms the purple east
Convoke the peerage and the gods attest
The sorrows of your inmost soul relate
And form sure plans to save the sinking state
Should second love a pleasing flame inspire
And the chaste queen connubial rights require
Dismissd with honour let her hence repair
To great Icarius whose paternal care
Will guide her passion and reward her choice
With wealthy dower and bridal gifts of price
Then let this dictate of my love prevail
Instant to foreign realms prepare to sail
To learn your fathers fortunes Fame may prove
Or omend voice the messenger of Jove
Propitious to the search Direct your toil
Through the wide ocean first to sandy Pyle
Of Nestor hoary sage his doom demand
Thence speed your voyage to the Spartan strand
For young Atrides to the Achaian coast
Arrived the last of all the victor host
If yet Ulysses views the light forbear
Till the fleet hours restore the circling year
But if his soul hath wingd the destined flight
Inhabitant of deep disastrous night
Homeward with pious speed repass the main
To the pale shade funereal rites ordain
Plant the fair column oer the vacant grave
A heros honours let the hero have
With decent grief the royal dead deplored
For the chaste queen select an equal lord
Then let revenge your daring mind employ
By fraud or force the suitor train destroy
And starting into manhood scorn the boy
Hast thou not heard how young Orestes fired
With great revenge immortal praise acquired
His virginsword AEgysthus veins imbrued
The murderer fell and blood atoned for blood
O greatly blessd with every blooming grace
With equal steps the paths of glory trace
Join to that royal youths your rival name
And shine eternal in the sphere of fame
But my associates now my stay deplore
Impatient on the hoarseresounding shore
Thou heedful of advice secure proceed
My praise the precept is be thine the deed

The counsel of my friend the youth rejoind
Imprints conviction on my grateful mind
So fathers speak persuasive speech and mild
Their sage experience to the favourite child
But since to part for sweet refection due
The genial viands let my train renew
And the rich pledge of plighted faith receive
Worthy the air of Ithaca to give

Defer the promised boon the goddess cries
Celestial azure brightening in her eyes
And let me now regain the Reithrian port
From Temese returnd your royal court
I shall revisit and that pledge receive
And gifts memorial of our friendship leave

Abrupt with eaglespeed she cut the sky
Instant invisible to mortal eye
Then first he recognized the ethereal guest
Wonder and joy alternate fire his breast
Heroic thoughts infused his heart dilate
Revolving much his fathers doubtful fate
At length composed he joind the suitorthrong
Hushd in attention to the warbled song
His tender theme the charming lyrist chose
Minervas anger and the dreadful woes
Which voyaging from Troy the victors bore
While storms vindictive intercept the store
The shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds
Reflecting to the queen the silver sounds
With grief renewd the weeping fair descends
Their sovereigns step a virgin train attends
A veil of richest texture wrought she wears
And silent to the joyous hall repairs
There from the portal with her mild command
Thus gently checks the minstrels tuneful hand

Phemius let acts of gods and heroes old
What ancient bards in hall and bower have told
Attemperd to the lyre your voice employ
Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy
But oh forbear that dear disastrous name
To sorrow sacred and secure of fame
My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound
And every piercing note inflicts a wound

Why dearest object of my duteous love
Replied the prince will you the bard reprove
Oft Joves ethereal rays resistless fire
The chanters soul and raptured song inspire
Instinct divine nor blame severe his choice
Warbling the Grecian woes with heart and voice
For novel lays attract our ravishd ears
But old the mind with inattention hears
Patient permit the sadly pleasing strain
Familiar now with grief your tears refrain
And in the public woe forget your own
You weep not for a perishd lord alone
What Greeks new wandering in the Stygian gloom
Wish your Ulysses shared an equal doom
Your widowd hours apart with female toil
And various labours of the loom beguile
There rule from palacecares remote and free
That care to man belongs and most to me

Mature beyond his years the queen admires
His sage reply and with her train retires
Then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds
With echoing grief afresh the dome resounds
Till Pallas piteous of her plaintive cries
In slumber closed her silverstreaming eyes

Meantime rekindled at the royal charms
Tumultuous love each beating bosom warms
Intemperate rage a wordy war began
But bold Telemachus assumed the man
Instant he cried your female discord end
Ye deedless boasters and the song attend
Obey that sweet compulsion nor profane
With dissonance the smooth melodious strain
Pacific now prolong the jovial feast
But when the dawn reveals the rosy east
I to the peers assembled shall propose
The firm resolve I here in few disclose
No longer live the cankers of my court
All to your several states with speed resort
Waste in wild riot what your land allows
There ply the early feast and late carouse
But if to honour lost tis still decreed
For you my bowl shall flow my flock shall bleed
Judge and revenge my right impartial Jove
By him and all the immortal thrones above
A sacred oath each proud oppressor slain
Shall with inglorious gore this marble stain

Awed by the prince thus haughty bold and young
Rage gnawd the lip and wonder chaind the tongue
Silence at length the gay Antinous broke
Constraind a smile and thus ambiguous spoke
What god to your untutord youth affords
This headlong torrent of amazing words
May Jove delay thy reign and cumber late
So bright a genius with the toils of state

Those toils Telemachus serene replies
Have charms with all their weight tallure the wise
Fast by the throne obsequious fame resides
And wealth incessant rolls her golden tides
Nor let Antinous rage if strong desire
Of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire
Elect by Jove his delegate of sway
With joyous pride the summons Id obey
Wheneer Ulysses roams the realm of night
Should factious power dispute my lineal right
Some other Greeks a fairer claim may plead
To your pretence their title would precede
At least the sceptre lost I still should reign
Sole oer my vassals and domestic train

To this Eurymachus To Heaven alone
Refer the choice to fill the vacant throne
Your patrimonial stores in peace possess
Undoubted all your filial claim confess
Your private right should impious power invade
The peers of Ithaca would arm in aid
But say that stranger guest who late withdrew
What and from whence his name and lineage shew
His grave demeanour and majestic grace
Speak him descended of no vulgar race
Did he some loan of ancient right require
Or came forerunner of your sceptrd sire

Oh son of Polybus the prince replies
No more my sire will glad these longing eyes
The queens fond hope inventive rumour cheers
Or vain diviners dreams divert her fears
That strangerguest the Taphian realm obeys
A realm defended with encircling seas
Mentes an everhonourd name of old
High in Ulysses social list enrolld

Thus he though conscious of the ethereal guest
Answerd evasive of the sly request
Meantime the lyre rejoins the sprightly lay
Lovedittied airs and dance conclude the day
But when the star of eve with golden light
Adornd the matron brow of sable night
The mirthful train dispersing quit the court
And to their several domes to rest resort
A towering structure to the palace joind
To this his steps the thoughtful prince inclined
In his pavilion there to sleep repairs
The lighted torch the sage Euryclea bears
Daughter of Ops the just Pisenors son
For twenty beeves by great Laertes won
In rosy prime with charms attractive graced
Honourd by him a gentle lord and chaste
With dear esteem too wise with jealous strife
To taint the joys of sweet connubial life
Sole with Telemachus her service ends
A child she nursed him and a man attends
Whilst to his couch himself the prince addressd
The duteous dame received the purple vest
The purple vest with decent care disposed
The silver ring she pulld the door reclosed
The bolt obedient to the silken cord
To the strong staples inmost depth restored
Secured the valves There wrapped in silent shade
Pensive the rules the goddess gave he weighd
Stretchd on the downy fleece no rest he knows
And in his raptured soul the vision glows



BOOK II

ARGUMENT

THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA

Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the
injustice done him by the suitors and insists upon their
departure from his palace appealing to the princes and exciting
the people to declare against them The suitors endeavour to
justify their stay at least till he shall send the queen to the
court of Icarius her father which he refuses There appears a
prodigy of two eagles in the sky which an augur expounds to the
ruin of the suitors Telemachus the demands a vessel to carry him
to Pylos and Sparta there to inquire of his fathers fortunes
Pallas in the shape of Mentor an ancient friend of Ulysses
helps him to a ship assists him in preparing necessaries for the
voyage and embarks with him that night which concludes the
second day from the opening of the poem The scene continues in
the palace of Ulysses in Ithaca



Now reddening from the dawn the morning ray
Glowd in the front of heaven and gave the day
The youthful hero with returning light
Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night
A royal robe he wore with graceful pride
A twoedged falchion threatend by his side
Embroiderd sandals glitterd as he trod
And forth he moved majestic as a god
Then by his heralds restless of delay
To council calls the peers the peers obey
Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate
From his high dome himself descends in state
Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined
Two dogs a faithful guard attend behind
Pallas with grace divine his form improves
And gazing crowds admire him as he moves

His fathers throne he filld while distant stood
The hoary peers and aged wisdom bowd

Twas silence all At last AEgyptius spoke
AEgyptius by his age and sorrow broke
A length of days his soul with prudence crownd
A length of days had bent him to the ground
His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came
By great Ulysses taught the path to fame
But hapless youth the hideous Cyclops tore
His quivering limbs and quaffd his spouting gore
Three sons remaind to climb with haughty fires
The royal bed Eurynomus aspires
The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage
And ease the sire of half the cares of age
Yet still his Antiphus he loves he mourns
And as he stood he spoke and wept by turns

Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains
Within these walls inglorious silence reigns
Say then ye peers by whose commands we meet
Why here once more in solemn council sit
Ye young ye old the weighty cause disclose
Arrives some message of invading foes
Or say does high necessity of state
Inspire some patriot and demand debate
The present synod speaks its author wise
Assist him Jove thou regent of the skies

He spoke Telemachus with transport glows
Embraced the omen and majestic rose
His royal hand the imperial sceptre swayd
Then thus addressing to AEgyptius said

Reverend old man lo here confessd he stands
By whom ye meet my grief your care demands
No story I unfold of public woes
Nor bear advices of impending foes
Peace the blest land and joys incessant crown
Of all this happy realm I grieve alone
For my lost sire continual sorrows spring
The great the good your father and your king
Yet more our house from its foundation bows
Our foes are powerful and your sons the foes
Hither unwelcome to the queen they come
Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome
If she must wed from other hands require
The dowry is Telemachus her sire
Yet through my court the noise of revel rings
And waste the wise frugality of kings
Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice
Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies
Safe in my youth in riot still they grow
Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe
But come it will the time when manhood grants
More powerful advocates than vain complaints
Approach that hour insufferable wrong
Cries to the gods and vengeance sleeps too long
Rise then ye peers with virtuous anger rise
Your fame revere but most the avenging skies
By all the deathless powers that reign above
By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove
Themis who gives to councils or denies
Success and humbles or confirms the wise
Rise in my aid suffice the tears that flow
For my lost sire nor add new woe to woe
If eer he bore the sword to strengthen ill
Or having power to wrong betrayd the will
On me on me your kindled wrath assuage
And bid the voice of lawless riot rage
If ruin to your royal race ye doom
Be you the spoilers and our wealth consume
Then might we hope redress from juster laws
And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause
But while your sons commit the unpunishd wrong
You make the arm of violence too strong

While thus he spoke with rage and grief he frownd
And dashd the imperial sceptre to the ground
The big round tear hung trembling in his eye
The synod grieved and gave a pitying sigh
Then silent sateat length Antinous burns
With haughty rage and sternly thus returns

O insolence of youth whose tongue affords
Such railing eloquence and war of words
Studious thy countrys worthies to defame
Thy erring voice displays thy mothers shame
Elusive of the bridal day she gives
Fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives
Did not the sun through heavens wide azure rolld
For three long years the royal fraud behold
While she laborious in delusion spread
The spacious loom and mixd the various thread
Where as to life the wondrous figures rise
Thus spoke the inventive queen with artful sighs

Though cold in death Ulysses breathes no more
Cease yet awhile to urge the bridal hour
Cease till to great Laertes I bequeath
A task of grief his ornaments of death
Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim
The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame
When he whom living mighty realms obeyd
Shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade

Thus she at once the generous train complies
Nor fraud mistrusts in virtues fair disguise
The work she plied but studious of delay
By night reversed the labours of the day
While thrice the sun his annual journey made
The conscious lamp the midnight fraud surveyd
Unheard unseen three years her arts prevail
The fourth her maid unfolds the amazing tale
We saw as unperceived we took our stand
The backward labours of her faithless hand
Then urged she perfects her illustrious toils
A wondrous monument of female wiles

But you O peers and thou O prince give ear
I speak aloud that every Greek may hear
Dismiss the queen and if her sire approves
Let him espouse her to the peer she loves
Bid instant to prepare the bridal train
Nor let a race of princes wait in vain
Though with a grace divine her soul is blest
And all Minerva breathes within her breast
In wondrous arts than woman more renownd
And more than woman with deep wisdom crownd
Though Tyro nor Mycene match her name
Not great Alemena the proud boasts of fame
Yet thus by heaven adornd by heavens decree
She shines with fatal excellence to thee
With thee the bowl we drain indulge the feast
Till righteous heaven reclaim her stubborn breast
What though from pole to pole resounds her name
The sons destruction waits the mothers fame
For till she leaves thy court it is decreed
Thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed

While yet he speaks Telemachus replies
Evn nature starts and what ye ask denies
Thus shall I thus repay a mothers cares
Who gave me life and nursed my infant years
While sad on foreign shores Ulysses treads
Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades
How to Icarius in the bridal hour
Shall I by waste undone refund the dower
How from my father should I vengeance dread
How would my mother curse my hated head
And while In wrath to vengeful fiends she cries
How from their hell would vengeful fiends arise
Abhorrd by all accursed my name would grow
The earths disgrace and humankind my foe
If this displease why urge ye here your stay
Haste from the court ye spoilers haste away
Waste in wild riot what your land allows
There ply the early feast and late carouse
But if to honour lost tis still decreed
For you my bowl shall flow my flocks shall bleed
Judge and assert my right impartial Jove
By him and all the immortal host above
A sacred oath if heaven the power supply
Vengeance I vow and for your wrongs ye die

With that two eagles from a mountains height
By Joves command direct their rapid flight
Swift they descend with wing to wing conjoind
Stretch their broad plumes and float upon the wind
Above the assembled peers they wheel on high
And clang their wings and hovering beat the sky
With ardent eyes the rival train they threat
And shrieking loud denounce approaching fate
They cuff they tear their cheeks and neck they rend
And from their plumes huge drops of blood descend
Then sailing oer the domes and towers they fly
Full toward the east and mount into the sky

The wondering rivals gaze with cares oppressd
And chilling horrors freeze in every breast
Till big with knowledge of approaching woes
The prince of augurs Halitherses rose
Prescient he viewd the aerial tracks and drew
A sure presage from every wing that flew

Ye sons he cried of Ithaca give ear
Hear all but chiefly you O rivals hear
Destruction sure oer all your heads impends
Ulysses comes and death his steps attends
Nor to the great alone is death decreed
We and our guilty Ithaca must bleed
Why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay
Be humbled all and lead ye great the way
For lo my words no fancied woes relate
I speak from science and the voice of fate

When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores
To shake with war proud Ilions lofty towers
Deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold
Heaven seald my words and you those deeds behold
I see I cried his woes a countless train
I see his friends oerwhelmd beneath the main
How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams
Now twice ten years are past and now he comes

To whom EurymachusFly dotard fly
With thy wise dreams and fables of the sky
Go prophesy at home thy sons advise
Here thou art sage in vainI better read the skies
Unnumberd birds glide through the aerial way
Vagrants of air and unforeboding stray
Cold in the tomb or in the deeps below
Ulysses lies oh wert thou laid as low
Then would that busy head no broils suggest
For fire to rage Telemachus breast
From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires
And interest not the god thy voice inspires
His guideless youth if thy experienced age
Mislead fallacious into idle rage
Vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress
And but augment the wrongs thou wouldst redress
Telemachus may bid the queen repair
To great Icarius whose paternal care
Will guide her passion and reward her choice
With wealthy dower and bridal gifts of price
Till she retires determined we remain
And both the prince and augur threat in vain
His pride of words and thy wild dream of fate
Move not the brave or only move their hate
Threat on O prince elude the bridal day
Threat on till all thy stores in waste decay
True Greece affords a train of lovely dames
In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames
But never from this nobler suit we cease
For wealth and beauty less than virtue please

To whom the youth Since then in vain I tell
My numerous woes in silence let them dwell
But Heaven and all the Greeks have heard my wrongs
To Heaven and all the Greeks redress belongs
Yet this I ask nor be it askd in vain
A bark to waft me oer the rolling main
The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore
And seek my royal sire from shore to shore
If or to fame his doubtful fate be known
Or to be learnd from oracles alone
If yet he lives with patience I forbear
Till the fleet hours restore the circling year
But if already wandering in the train
Of empty shades I measure back the main
Plant the fair column oer the mighty dead
And yield his consort to the nuptial bed

He ceased and while abashd the peers attend
Mentor arose Ulysses faithful friend
When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war
My friend he cried my palace be thy care
Years rolld on years my godlike sire decay
Guard thou his age and his behests obey
Stern as he rose he cast his eyes around
That flashd with rage and as spoke he frownd

O never never more let king be just
Be mild in power or faithful to his trust
Let tyrants govern with an iron rod
Oppress destroy and be the scourge of God
Since he who like a father held his reign
So soon forgot was just and mild in vain
True while my friend is grieved his griefs I share
Yet now the rivals are my smallest care
They for the mighty mischiefs they devise
Ere long shall paytheir forfeit lives the price
But against you ye Greeks ye coward train
Gods how my soul is moved with just disdain
Dumb ye all stand and not one tongue affords
His injured prince the little aid of words

While yet he spoke Leocritus rejoined
O pride of words and arrogance of mind
Wouldst thou to rise in arms the Greeks advise
Join all your powers in arms ye Greeks arise
Yet would your powers in vain our strength oppose
The valiant few oermatch a host of foes
Should great Ulysses stern appear in arms
While the bowl circles and the banquet warms
Though to his breast his spouse with transport flies
Torn from her breast that hour Ulysses dies
But hence retreating to your domes repair
To arm the vessel Mentor be thy care
And Halitherses thine be each his friend
Ye loved the father go the son attend
But yet I trust the boaster means to stay
Safe in the court nor tempt the watery way

Then with a rushing sound the assembly bend
Diverse their steps the rival rout ascend
The royal dome while sad the prince explores
The neighbouring main and sorrowing treads the shores
There as the waters oer his hands he shed
The royal suppliant to Minerva prayd

O goddess who descending from the skies
Vouchsafed thy presence to my wondering eyes
By whose commands the raging deeps I trace
And seek my sire through storms and rolling seas
Hear from thy heavens above O warrior maid
Descend once more propitious to my aid
Without thy presence vain is thy command
Greece and the rival train thy voice withstand

Indulgent to his prayer the goddess took
Sage Mentors form and thus like Mentor spoke

O prince in early youth divinely wise
Born the Ulysses of thy age to rise
If to the son the fathers worth descends
Oer the wide wave success thy ways attends
To tread the walks of death he stood prepared
And what he greatly thought he nobly dared
Were not wise sons descendant of the wise
And did not heroes from brave heroes rise
Vain were my hopes few sons attain the praise
Of their great sires and most their sires disgrace
But since thy veins paternal virtue fires
And all Penelope thy soul inspires
Go and succeed the rivals aims despise
For never never wicked man was wise
Blind they rejoice though now evn now they fall
Death hastes amain one hour oerwhelms them all
And lo with speed we plough the watery way
My power shall guard thee and my hand convey
The winged vessel studious I prepare
Through seas and realms companion of thy care
Thou to the court ascend and to the shores
When night advances bear the naval stores
Bread that decaying man with strength supplies
And generous wine which thoughtful sorrow flies
Meanwhile the mariners by my command
Shall speed aboard a valiant chosen band
Wide oer the bay by vessel vessel rides
The best I choose to waft then oer the tides

She spoke to his high dome the prince returns
And as he moves with royal anguish mourns
Twas riot all among the lawless train
Boar bled by boar and goat by goat lay slain
Arrived his hand the gay Antinous pressd
And thus deriding with a smile addressd

Grieve not O daring prince that noble heart
Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part
Indulge the genial hour unbend thy soul
Leave thought to age and drain the flowing bowl
Studious to ease thy grief our care provides
The bark to waft thee oer the swelling tides

Is this returns the prince for mirth a time
When lawless gluttons riot mirths a crime
The luscious wines dishonourd lose their taste
The song is noise and impious is the feast
Suffice it to have spent with swift decay
The wealth of kings and made my youth a prey
But now the wise instructions of the sage
And manly thoughts inspired by manly age
Teach me to seek redress for all my woe
Here or in Pylein Pyle or here your foe
Deny your vessels ye deny in vain
A private voyager I pass the main
Free breathe the winds and free the billows flow
And where on earth I live I live your foe

He spoke and frownd nor longer deignd to stay
Sternly his hand withdrew and strode away

Meantime oer all the dome they quaff they feast
Derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest
And each in jovial mood his mate addressd

Tremble ye not O friends and coward fly
Doomd by the stern Telemachus to die
To Pyle or Sparta to demand supplies
Big with revenge the mighty warrior flies
Or comes from Ephyre with poisons fraught
And kills us all in one tremendous draught

Or who can say his gamesome mate replies
But while the danger of the deeps he tries
He like his sire may sink deprived of breath
And punish us unkindly by his death
What mighty labours would he then create
To seize his treasures and divide his state
The royal palace to the queen convey
Or him she blesses in the bridal day

Meantime the lofty rooms the prince surveys
Where lay the treasures of the Ithacian race
Here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed
There polished chests embroiderd vestures graced
Here jars of oil breathed forth a rich perfume
There casks of wine in rows adornd the dome
Pure flavorous wine by gods in bounty given
And worthy to exalt the feasts of heaven
Untouchd they stood till his long labours oer
The great Ulysses reachd his native shore
A double strength of bars secured the gates
Fast by the door the wise Euryclea waits
Euryclea who great Ops thy lineage shared
And watchd all night all day a faithful guard

To whom the prince O thou whose guardian care
Nursed the most wretched king that breathes the air
Untouchd and sacred may these vessels stand
Till great Ulysses views his native land
But by thy care twelve urns of wine be filld
Next these in worth and firm these urns be seald
And twice ten measures of the choicest flour
Prepared are yet descends the evening hour
For when the favouring shades of night arise
And peaceful slumbers close my mothers eyes
Me from our coast shall spreading sails convey
To seek Ulysses through the watery way

While yet he spoke she filld the walls with cries
And tears ran trickling from her aged eyes
O whither whither flies my son she cried
To realms that rocks and roaring seas divide
In foreign lands thy fathers days decayd
And foreign lands contain the mighty dead
The watery way illfated if thou try
All all must perish and by fraud you die
Then stay my child storms beat and rolls the main
Oh beat those storms and roll the seas in vain

Far hence replied the prince thy fears be driven
Heaven calls me forth these counsels are of Heaven
But by the powers that hate the perjured swear
To keep my voyage from the royal ear
Nor uncompelld the dangerous truth betray
Till twice six times descends the lamp of day
Lest the sad tale a mothers life impair
And grief destroy what time awhile would spare

Thus he The matron with uplifted eyes
Attests the allseeing sovereign of the skies
Then studious she prepares the choicest flour
The strength of wheat and wines an ample store
While to the rival train the prince returns
The martial goddess with impatience burns
Like thee Telemachus in voice and size
With speed divine from street to street she flies
She bids the mariners prepared to stand
When night descends embodied on the strand
Then to Noemon swift she runs she flies
And asks a bark the chief a bark supplies

And now declining with his sloping wheels
Down sunk the sun behind the western hills
The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores
And stowd within its womb the naval stores
Full in the openings of the spacious main
It rides and now descends the sailortrain

Next to the court impatient of delay
With rapid step the goddess urged her way
There every eye with slumberous chains she bound
And dashd the flowing goblet to the ground
Drowsy they rose with heavy fumes oppressd
Reeld from the palace and retired to rest
Then thus in Mentors reverend form arrayd
Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid
Lo on the seas prepared the vessel stands
The impatient mariner thy speed demands
Swift as she spoke with rapid pace she leads
The footsteps of the deity he treads
Swift to the shore they move along the strand
The ready vessel rides the sailors ready stand

He bids them bring their stores the attending train
Load the tall bark and launch into the main
The prince and goddess to the stern ascend
To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend
Full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow
The sable billows foam and roar below
The chief his orders gives the obedient band
With due observance wait the chiefs command
With speed the mast they rear with speed unbind
The spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
High oer the roaring waves the spreading sails
Bow the tall mast and swell before the gales
The crooked keel the parting surge divides
And to the stern retreating roll the tides
And now they ship their oars and crown with wine
The holy goblet to the powers divine
Imploring all the gods that reign above
But chief the blueeyed progeny of Jove

Thus all the night they stem the liquid way
And end their voyage with the morning ray



BOOK III

ARGUMENT

THE INTERVIEW OF TELEMACHUS AND NESTOR

Telemachus guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor arrives in
the morning at Pylos where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on
the seashore to Neptune Telemachus declares the occasion of his
coming and Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy
how their fleets were separated and he never since heard of
Ulysses They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon the
revenge of Orestes and the injuries of the suitors Nestor
advises him to go to Sparta and inquire further of Menelaus The
sacrifice ending with the night Minerva vanishes from them in the
form of an eagle Telemachus is lodged in the palace The next
morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva and Telemachus
proceeds on his journey to Sparta attended by Pisistratus

The scene lies on the seashore of Pylos


The sacred sun above the waters raised
Through heavens eternal brazen portals blazed
And wide oer earth diffused his cheering ray
To gods and men to give the golden day
Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls
Before old Neleus venerable walls
There suppliant to the monarch of the flood
At nine green theatres the Pylians stood
Each held five hundred a deputed train
At each nine oxen on the sand lay slain
They taste the entrails and the altars load
With smoking thighs an offering to the god
Full for the port the Ithacensians stand
And furl their sails and issue on the land
Telemachus already pressd the shore
Not first the power of wisdom marchd before
And ere the sacrificing throng he joind
Admonishd thus his wellattending mind

Proceed my son this youthful shame expel
An honest business never blush to tell
To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain
We passd the wide immeasurable main
Meet then the senior far renownd for sense
With reverend awe but decent confidence
Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies
And sure he will for wisdom never lies

Oh tell me Mentor tell me faithful guide
The youth with prudent modesty replied
How shall I meet or how accost the sage
Unskilld in speech nor yet mature of age
Awful thapproach and hard the task appears
To question wisely men of riper years

To whom the martial goddess thus rejoind
Search for some thoughts thy own suggesting mind
And others dictated by heavenly power
Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour
For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend
Born with good omens and with heaven thy friend

She spoke and led the way with swiftest speed
As swift the youth pursued the way she led
and joind the band before the sacred fire
Where sate encompassd with his sons the sire
The youth of Pylos some on pointed wood
Transfixd the fragments some prepared the food
In friendly throngs they gather to embrace
Their unknown guests and at the banquet place
Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands
And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands
Along the shore the illustrious pair he led
Where Nestor sate with the youthful Thrasymed
To each a portion of the feast he bore
And held the golden goblet foaming oer
Then first approaching to the elder guest
The latent goddess in these words addressd
Whoeer thou art from fortune brings to keep
These rites of Neptune monarch of the deep
Thee first it fits O stranger to prepare
The due libation and the solemn prayer
Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine
Though much thy younger and his years like mine
He too I deem implores the power divine
For all mankind alike require their grace
All born to want a miserable race
He spake and to her hand preferrd the bowl
A secret pleasure touchd Athenas soul
To see the preference due to sacred age
Regarded ever by the just and sage
Of Oceans king she then implores the grace
O thou whose arms this ample globe embrace
Fulfil our wish and let thy glory shine
On Nestor first and Nestors royal line
Next grant the Pylian states their just desires
Pleased with their hecatombs ascending fires
Last deign Telemachus and me to bless
And crown our voyage with desired success

Thus she and having paid the rite divine
Gave to Ulysses son the rosy wine
Suppliant he prayd And now the victims dressd
They draw divide and celebrate the feast
The banquet done the narrative old man
Thus mild the pleasing conference began

Now gentle guests the genial banquet oer
It fits to ask ye what your native shore
And whence your race on what adventure say
Thus far you wander through the watery way
Relate if business or the thirst of gain
Engage your journey oer the pathless main
Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown
The lives of others venturous of their own

Urged by the precepts by the goddess given
And filld with confidence infused from Heaven
The youth whom Pallas destined to be wise
And famed among the sons of men replies
Inquirst thou father from what coast we came
Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name
From where high Ithaca oerlooks the floods
Brown with oerarching shades and pendent woods
Us to these shores our filial duty draws
A private sorrow not a public cause
My sire I seek whereer the voice of fame
Has told the glories of his noble name
The great Ulysses famed from shore to shore
For valour much for hardy suffering more
Long time with thee before proud Ilions wall
In arms he fought with thee beheld her fall
Of all the chiefs this heros fate alone
Has Jove reserved unheard of and unknown
Whether in fields by hostile fury slain
Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main
Of this to learn oppressd with tender fears
Lo at thy knee his suppliant son appears
If or thy certain eye or curious ear
Have learnt his fate the whole dark story clear
And oh whateer Heaven destined to betide
Let neither flattery soothe nor pity hide
Prepared I stand he was but born to try
The lot of man to suffer and to die
Oh then if ever through the ten years war
The wise the good Ulysses claimd thy care
If eer he joind thy council or thy sword
True in his deed and constant to his word
Far as thy mind through backward time can see
Search all thy stores of faithful memory
Tis sacred truth I ask and ask of thee

To him experienced Nestor thus rejoind
O friend what sorrows dost thou bring to mind
Shall I the long laborious scene review
And open all the wounds of Greece anew
What toils by sea where dark in quest of prey
Dauntless we roved Achilles led the way
What toils by land where mixd in fatal fight
Such numbers fell such heroes sunk to night
There Ajax great Achilles there the brave
There wise Patroclus fill an early grave
There too my sonah once my best delight
Once swift of foot and terrible in fight
In whom stern courage with soft virtue joind
A faultless body and a blameless mind
AntilochusWhat more can I relate
How trace the tedious series of our fate
Not added years on years my task could close
The long historian of my countrys woes
Back to thy native islands mightst thou sail
And leave halfheard the melancholy tale
Nine painful years on that detested shore
What stratagems we formd what toils we bore
Still labouring on till scarce at last we found
Great Jove propitious and our conquest crownd
Far oer the rest thy mighty father shined
In wit in prudence and in force of mind
Art thou the son of that illustrious sire
With joy I grasp thee and with love admire
So like your voices and your words so wise
Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes
Thy sire and I were one nor varied aught
In public sentence or in private thought
Alike to council or the assembly came
With equal souls and sentiments the same
But when by wisdom won proud Ilion burnd
And in their ships the conquering Greeks returnd
Twas Gods high will the victors to divide
And turn the event confounding human pride
Some be destroyd some scatterd as the dust
Not all were prudent and not all were just
Then Discord sent by Pallas from above
Stern daughter of the great avenger Jove
The brotherkings inspired with fell debate
Who calld to council all the Achaian state
But calld untimely not the sacred rite
Observed nor heedful of the setting light
Nor herald sword the session to proclaim
Sour with debauch a reeling tribe the came
To these the cause of meeting they explain
And Menelaus moves to cross the main
Not so the king of men be willd to stay
The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay
And calm Minervas wrath Oh blind to fate
The gods not lightly change their love or hate
With ireful taunts each other they oppose
Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose
Now different counsels every breast divide
Each burns with rancour to the adverse side
The unquiet night strange projects entertaind
So Jove that urged us to our fate ordaind
We with the rising morn our ships unmoord
And brought our captives and our stores aboard
But half the people with respect obeyd
The king of men and at his bidding stayd
Now on the wings of winds our course we keep
For God had smoothd the waters of the deep
For Tenedos we spread our eager oars
There land and pay due victims to the powers
To bless our safe return we join in prayer
But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air
And raised new discord Then so Heaven decreed
Ulysses first and Neator disagreed
Wise as he was by various counsels awayd
He there though late to please the monarch stayd
But I determined stem the foamy floods
Warnd of the coming fury of the gods
With us Tydides feard and urged his haste
And Menelaus came but came the last
He joind our vessels in the Lesbian bay
While yet we doubted of our watery way
If to the right to urge the pilots toil
The safer road beside the Psyrian isle
Or the straight course to rocky Chios plough
And anchor under Mimas shaggy brow
We sought direction of the power divine
The god propitious gave the guiding sign
Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer
And in Euboea shun the woes we fear
The whistling winds already waked the sky
Before the whistling winds the vessels fly
With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way
And reach Gerestus at the point of day
There hecacombs of bulls to Neptune slain
Highflaming please the monarch of the main
The fourth day shone when all their labours oer
Tydides vessels touched the wishdfor shore
But I to Pylos scud before the gales
The god still breathing on my swelling sails
Separate from all I safely landed here
Their fates or fortunes never reachd my ear
Yet what I learnd attend as here I sat
And askd each voyager each heros fate
Curious to know and willing to relate

Safe reachd the Myrmidons their native land
Beneath Achilles warlike sons command
Those whom the heir of great Apollos art
Brave Philoctetes taught to wing the dart
And those whom Idomen from Ilions plain
Had led securely crossd the dreadful main
How Agamemnon touchd his Argive coast
And how his life by fraud and force he lost
And how the murderer paid his forfeit breath
What lands so distant from that scene of death
But trembling heard the fame and heard admire
How well the son appeased his slaughterd sire
Evn to the unhappy that unjustly bleed
Heaven gives posterity to avenge the deed
So fell Aegysthus and mayest thou my friend
On whom the virtues of thy sire descend
Make future times thy equal act adore
And be what brave Orestes was before

The prudent youth replied O thou the grace
And lasting glory of the Grecian race
Just was the vengeance and to latest days
Shall long posterity resound the praise
Some god this arm with equal prowess bless
And the proud suitors shall its force confess
Injurious men who while my soul is sore
Of fresh affronts are meditating more
But Heaven denies this honour to my hand
Nor shall my father repossess the land
The fathers fortune never to return
And the sad sons to softer and to mourn
Thus he and Nestor took the word My son
Is it then true as distant rumours run
That crowds of rivals for thy mothers charms
Thy palace fill with insults and alarms
Say is the fault through tame submission thine
Or leagued against thee do thy people join
Moved by some oracle or voice divine
And yet who knows but ripening lies in fate
An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state
When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms
Ulysses singly or all Greece in arms
But if Athena wars triumphant maid
The happy son will as the father aid
Whose fame and safety was her constant care
In every danger and in every war
Never on man did heavenly favour shine
With rays so strong distinguishd and divine
As those with which Minerva markd thy sire
So might she love thee so thy soul inspire
Soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid
And long oblivion of the bridal bed

Ah no such hope the prince with sighs replies
Can touch my breast that blessing Heaven denies
Evn by celestial favour were it given
Fortune or fate would cross the will of Heaven

What words are these and what imprudence thine
Thus interposed the martial maid divine
Forgetful youth but know the Power above
With ease can save each object of his love
Wide as his will extends his boundless grace
Nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place
Happier his lot who many sorrows passd
Long labouring gains his natal shore at last
Than who too speedy hastes to end his life
By some stern ruffian or adulterous wife
Death only is the lot which none can miss
And all is possible to Heaven but this
The best the dearest favourite of the sky
Must taste that cup for man is born to die

Thus checkd replied Ulysses prudent heir
Mentor no morethe mournful thought forbear
For he no more must draw his countrys breath
Already snatchd by fate and the black doom of death
Pass we to other subjects and engage
On themes remote the venerable sage
Who thrice has seen the perishable kind
Of men decay and through three ages shined
Like gods majestic and like gods in mind
For much he knows and just conclusions draws
From various precedents and various laws
O son of Neleus awful Nestor tell
How he the mighty Agamemnon fell
By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought relate
By force he could not such a heros fate
Live Menelaus not in Greece or where
Was then the martial brothers pious care
Condemnd perhaps some foreign short to tread
Or sure Aegysthus had not dared the deed
To whom the full of days Illustrious youth
Attend though partly thou hast guessd the truth
For had the martial Menelaus found
The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground
Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies
Nor Grecian virgins shriekd his obsequies
But fowls obscene dismemberd his remains
And dogs had torn him on the naked plains
While us the works of bloody Mars employd
The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoyd
He stretchd at ease in Argos calm recess
Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless
With flatterys insinuating art
Soothed the frail queen and poisond all her heard
At first with the worthy shame and decent pride
The royal dame his lawless suit denied
For virtues image yet possessd her mind
Taught by a master of the tuneful kind
Atrides parting for the Trojan war
Consignd the youthful consort to his care
True to his charge the bard preserved her long
In honours limits such the power of song
But when the gods these objects of their hate
Draggd to the destruction by the links of fate
The bard they banishd from his native soil
And left all helpless in a desert isle
There he the sweetest of the sacred train
Sung dying to the rocks but sung in vain
Then virtue was no more her guard away
She fell to lust a voluntary prey
Even to the temple stalkd the adulterous spouse
With impious thanks and mockery of the vows
With images with garments and with gold
And odorous fumes from loaded altars rolld
Meantime from flaming Troy we cut the way
With Menelaus through the curling sea
But when to Suniums sacred point we came
Crownd with the temple of the Athenian dame
Atrides pilot Phrontes there expired
Phrontes of all the songs of men admired
To steer the bounding bark with steady toil
When the storm thickens and the billows boil
While yet he exercised the steermans art
Apollo touchd him with his gentle dart
Even with the rudder in his hand he fell
To pay whole honours to the shades of hell
We checkd our haste by pious office bound
And laid our old companion in the ground
And now the rites discharged our course we keep
Far on the gloomy bosom of the deep
Soon as Malaes misty tops arise
Sudden the Thunderer blackens all the skies
And the winds whistle and the surges roll
Mountains on mountains and obscure the pole
The tempest scatters and divides our fleet
Part the storm urges on the coast of Crete
Where winding round the rich Cydonian plain
The streams of Jardan issue to the main
There stands a rock high eminent and steep
Whose shaggy brow oerhangs the shady deep
And views Gortyna on the western side
On this rough Auster drove the impetuous tide
With broken force the billows rolld away
And heaved the fleet into the neighbring bay
Thus saved from death the gaind the Phaestan shores
With shatterd vessels and disabled oars
But five tall barks the winds and water tossd
Far from their fellows on the Aegyptian coast
There wanderd Menelaus through foreign shores
Amassing gold and gathering naval stores
While cursed Aegysthus the detested deed
By fraud fulfilled and his great brother bled
Seven years the traitor rich Mycenae swayd
And his stern rule the groaning land obeyd
The eighth from Athens to his realm restored
Orestes brandishd the avenging sword
Slew the dire pair and gave to funeral flame
The vile assassin and adulterous dame
That day ere yet the bloody triumphs cease
Returnd Atrides to the coast of Greece
And safe to Argos port his navy brought
With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught
Hence warnd my son beware nor idly stand
Too long a stranger to thy native land
Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away
While lawless feasters in thy palace away
Perhaps may seize thy realm and share the spoil
And though return with disappointed toil
From thy vain journey to a rifled isle
However my friend indulge one labour more
And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore
He wandering long a wider circle made
And manylanguaged nations has surveyd
And measured tracks unknown to other ships
Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps
A length of ocean and unbounded sky
Which scarce the seafowl in a year oerfly
Go then to Sparta take the watery way
Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay
Or if my land then choose thy course to bend
My steeds my chariots and my songs attend
Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey
Guides of thy road companions of thy way
Urge him with truth to frame his wise replies
And sure he will for Menelaus is wise
Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends
And twilight grey her evening shade extends
Then thus the blueeyed maid O full of days
Wise are thy words and just are all thy ways
Now immolate the tongues and mix the wine
Sacred to Neptune and the powers divine
The lamp of day is quenchd beneath the deep
And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep
Nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast
Timeless indecent but retire to rest

So spake Joves daughter the celestial maid
The sober train attended and obeyd
The sacred heralds on their hands around
Pourd the full urns the youths the goblets crownd
From bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows
While to the final sacrifice they rose
The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame
And pour above the consecrated stream
And now their thirst by copious draughts allayd
The youthful hero and the Athenian maid
Propose departure from the finishd rite
And in their hollow bark to pass the night
But this hospitable sage denied
Forbid it Jove and all the gods he cried
Thus from my walls and the muchloved son to send
Of such a hero and of such a friend
Me as some needy peasant would ye leave
Whom Heaven denies the blessing to relieve
Me would ye leave who boast imperial sway
When beds of royal state invite your stay
Nolong as life this mortal shall inspire
Or as my children imitate their sire
Here shall the wandering stranger find his home
And hospitable rites adorn the dome

Well hast thou spoke the blueeyed maid replies
Beloved old man benevolent as wise
Be the kind dictates of thy heart obeyd
And let thy words Telemachus persuade
He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue
I to the ship to give the orders due
Prescribe directions and confirm the crew
For I alone sustain their naval cares
Who boast experience from these silver hairs
All youths the rest whom to this journey move
Like years like tempers and their princes love
There in the vessel shall I pass the night
And soon as morning paints the fields of light
I go to challenge from the Caucons bold
A debt contracted in the days of old
But this thy guest received with friendly care
Let thy strong coursers swift to Sparta bear
Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day
And be thy son companion of his way

Then turning with the word Minerva flies
And soars an eagle through the liquid skies
Vision divine the throngd spectators gaze
In holy wonder fixd and still amaze
But chief the reverend sage admired he took
The hand of young Telemachus and spoke
Oh happy youth and favoured of the skies
Distinguished care of guardian deities
Whose early years for future worth engage
No vulgar manhood no ignoble age
For lo none other of the course above
Then she the daughter of almighty Jove
Pallas herself the wartriumphant maid
Confessd is thine as once thy fathers aid
So guide me goddess so propitious shine
On me my consort and my royal line
A yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke
Untamed unconscious of the galling yoke
With ample forehead and yet tender horns
Whose budding honours ductile gold adorns

Submissive thus the hoary sire preferrd
His holy vow the favouring goddess heard
Then slowly rising oer the sandy space
Precedes the father followd by his race
A long procession timely marching home
In comely order to the regal dome
There when arrived on thrones around him placed
His sons and grandsons the wide circle graced
To these the hospitable sage in sign
Of social welcome mixd the racy wine
Late from the mellowing cask restored to light
By ten long years refined and rosy bright
To Pallas high the foaming bowl he crownd
And sprinkled large libations on the ground
Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares
And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs
Deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid
And slept beneath the pompous colonnade
Fast by his side Pisistratus was spread
In age his equal on a splendid bed
But in an inner court securely closed
The reverend Nestor and his queen reposed

When now Aurora daughter of the dawn
With rosy lustre purpled oer the lawn
The old man early rose walkd forth and sate
On polishd stone before his palace gate
With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone
Where ancient Neleus sate a rustic throne
But he descending to the infernal shade
Sage Nestor filld it and the sceptre swayd
His sons around him mild obeisance pay
And duteous take the orders of the day
First Eehephron and Stratius quit their bed
Then Perseus Aretus and Thrasymed
The last Pisistratus arose from rest
They came and near him placed the strangerguest
To these the senior thus declared his will
My sons the dictates of your sire fulfil
To Pallas first of gods prepare the feast
Who graced our rites a more than mortal guest
Let one despatchful bid some swain to lead
A wellfed bullock from the grassy mead
One seek the harbour where the vessels moor
And bring thy friends Telemachus ashore
Leave only two the galley to attend
Another Laerceus must we send
Artist devine whose skilful hands infold
The victims horn with circumfusile gold
The rest may here the pious duty share
And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare
The seats to range the fragrant wood to bring
And limpid waters from the living spring

He said and busy each his care bestowd
Already at the gates the bullock lowd
Already came the Ithacensian crew
The dexterous smith the tools already drew
His ponderous hammer and his anvil sound
And the strong tongs to turn the metal round
Nor was Minerva absent from the rite
She viewd her honours and enjoyed the sight
With reverend hand the king presents the gold
Which round the intorted horns the gilder rolld
So wrought as Pallas might with pride behold
Young Aretus from forth his bride bower
Brought the full laver oer their hands to pour
And canisters of consecrated flour
Stratius and Echephron the victim led
The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed
In act to strike before him Perseus stood
The vase extending to receive the blood
The king himself initiates to the power
Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour
And the stream sprinkles from the curling brows
The hair collected in the fire he throws
Soon as due vows on every part were paid
And sacred wheat upon the victim laid
Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow
Full on his neck and cut the nerves in two
Down sunk the heavy beast the females round
Maids wives and matrons mix a shrilling sound
Nor scorned the queen the holy choir to join
The first born she of old Clymenus line
In youth by Nestor loved of spotless fame
And loved in age Eurydice her name
From earth they rear him struggling now with death
And Nestors youngest stops the vents of breath
The soul for ever flies on all sides round
Streams the black blood and smokes upon the ground
The beast they then divide and disunite
The ribs and limbs observant of the rite
On these in double cauls involved with art
The choicest morsels lay from every part
The sacred sage before his altar stands
Turns the burnt offering with his holy hands
And pours the wine and bids the flames aspire
The youth with instruments surround the fire
The thighs now sacrificed and entrails dressd
The assistants part transfix and broil the rest
While these officious tend the rites divine
The last fair branch of the Nestorean line
Sweet Polycaste took the pleasing toil
To bathe the prince and pour the fragrant oil
Oer his fair limbs a flowery vest he throw
And issued like a god to mortal view
His former seat beside the king he found
His peoples father with his peers around
All placed at ease the holy banquet join
And in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine

The rage of thirst and hunger now suppressd
The monarch turns him to his royal guest
And for the promised journey bids prepare
The smooth haird horses and the rapid car
Observant of his word tire word scarce spoke
The sons obey and join them to the yoke
Then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings
And presents such as suit the state of kings
The glittering seat Telemachus ascends
His faithful guide Pisistratus attends
With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew
He lashd the coursers and the coursers flew
Beneath the bounding yoke alike they hold
Their equal pace and smoked along the field
The towers of Pylos sink its views decay
Fields after fields fly back till close of day
Then sunk the sun and darkend all the way

To Pherae now Diocleus stately seat
Of Alpheus race the weary youths retreat
His house affords the hospitable rite
And pleased they sleep the blessing of the night
But when Aurora daughter of the dawn
With rosy lustre purpled oer the lawn
Again they mount their journey to renew
And from the sounding portico they flew
Along the waving fields their way they hold
The fields receding as their chariot rolld
Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light
And oer the shaded landscape rushd the night



BOOK IV

ARGUMENT

THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS

Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta is hospitably
received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming
and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks
since the destruction of Troy He dwells more at large upon the
prophecies of Proteus to him in his return from which he
acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of
Calypso

In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the
voyage home Penelope is apprised of this but comforted in a
dream by Pallas in the shape of her sister Iphthima



And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds
Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds
At the fair dome the rapid labour ends
Where sate Atrides midst his bridal friends
With double vows invoking Hymens power
To bless his sons and daughters nuptial hour

That day to great Achilles son resignd
Hermione the fairest of her kind
Was sent to crown the longprotracted joy
Espoused before the final doom of Troy
With steeds and gilded cars a gorgeous train
Attend the nymphs to Phthias distant reign
Meanwhile at home to Megapenthas bed
The virgin choir Alectors daughter led
Brave Megapenthas From a stolen amour
To great Atrides age his handmaid bore
To Helens bed the gods alone assign
Hermione to extend the regal line
On whom a radiant pomp oh Graces wait
Resembling Venus in attractive state

While this gay friendly troop the king surround
With festival and mirth the roofs resound
A bard amid the joyous circle sings
High airs attemperd to the vocal strings
Whilst warbling to the varied strain advance
Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance
Twas then that issuing through the palace gate
The splendid car rolld slow in regal state
On the bright eminence young Nestor shone
And fast beside him great Ulysses son
Grave Eteoneous saw the pomp appear
And speeding thus addressd the royal ear

Two youths approach whose semblant features prove
Their blood devolving from the source of Jove
Is due reception deignd or must they bend
Their doubtful course to seek a distant friend

Insensate with a sigh the king replies
Too long misjudging have I thought thee wise
But sure relentless folly steals thy breast
Obdurate to reject the strangerguest
To those dear hospitable rites a foe
Which in my wanderings oft relieved my woe
Fed by the bounty of anothers board
Till pitying Jove my native realm restored
Straight be the coursers from the car released
Conduct the youths to grace the genial feast

The seneschal rebuked in haste withdrew
With equal haste a menial train pursue
Part led the coursers from the car enlarged
Each to a crib with choicest grain surcharged
Part in a portico profusely graced
With rich magnificence the chariot placed
Then to the dome the friendly pair invite
Who eye the dazzling roofs with vast delight
Resplendent as the blaze of summer noon
Or the pale radiance of the midnight moon
From room to room their eager view they bend
Thence to the bath a beauteous pile descend
Where a bright damsel train attends the guests
With liquid odours and embroiderd vests
Refreshd they wait them to the bower of state
Where circled with his pears Atrides sate
Throned next the king a fair attendant brings
The purest product of the crystal springs
High on a massy vase of silver mould
The burnishd laver flames with solid gold
In solid gold the purple vintage flows
And on the board a second banquet rose
When thus the king with hospitable port
Accept this welcome to the Spartan court
The waste of nature let the feast repair
Then your high lineage and your names declare
Say from what sceptred ancestry ye claim
Recorded eminent in deathless fame
For vulgar parents cannot stamp their race
With signatures of such majestic grace

Ceasing benevolent he straight assigns
The royal portion of the choicest chines
To each accepted friend with grateful haste
They share the honours of the rich repast
Sufficed soft whispering thus to Nestors son
His head reclined young Ithacus begun

Viewst thou unmoved O everhonourd most
These prodigies of art and wondrous cost
Above beneath around the palace shines
The sunless treasure of exhausted mines
The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay
And studded amber darts the golden ray
Such and not nobler in the realms above
My wonder dictates is the dome of Jove

The monarch took the word and grave replied
Presumptuous are the vaunts and vain the pride
Of man who dares in pomp with Jove contest
Unchanged immortal and supremely blest
With all my affluence when my woes are weighd
Envy will own the purchase dearly paid
For eight slowcircling years by tempests tossd
From Cypress to the far Phoenician coast
Sidon the capital I stretchd my toil
Through regions fattend with the flows of Nile
Next Aethiopias utmost bound explore
And the parchd borders of the Arabian shore
Then warp my voyage on the southern gales
Oer the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails
That happy clime where each revolving year
The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear
And two fair crescents of translucent horn
The brows of all their young increase adorn
The shepherd swains with sure abundance blest
On the fat flock and rural dainties feast
Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail
But every season fills the foaming pail
Whilst heaping unwashd wealth I distant roam
The best of brothers at his natal home
By the dire fury of a traitress wife
Ends the sad evening of a stormy life
Whence with incessant grief my soul annoyd
These riches are possessd but not enjoyd
My wars the copious theme of every tongue
To you your fathers have recorded long
How favouring Heaven repaid my glorious toils
With a sackd palace and barbaric spoils
Oh had the gods so large a boon denied
And life the just equivalent supplied
To those brave warriors who with glory fired
Far from their country in my cause expired
Still in short intervals of pleasing woe
Regardful of the friendly dues I owe
I to the glorious dead for ever dear
Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear
But oh Ulyssesdeeper than the rest
That sad idea wounds my anxious breast
My heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain
The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain
Nor sleeps soft power can close my streaming eyes
When imaged to my soul his sorrows rise
No peril in my cause he ceased to prove
His labours equalld only by my love
And both alike to bitter fortune born
For him to suffer and for me to mourn
Whether he wanders on some friendly coast
Or glides in Stygian gloom a pensive ghost
No fame reveals but doubtful of his doom
His good old sire with sorrow to the tomb
Declines his trembling steps untimely care
Withers the blooming vigour of his heir
And the chaste partner of his bed and throne
Wastes all her widowd hours in tender moan

While thus pathetic to the prince he spoke
From the brave youth the streaming passion broke
Studious to veil the grief in vain repressd
His face he shrouded with his purple vest
The conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise
And viewd his filial love with vast surprise
Dubious to press the tender theme or wait
To hear the youth inquire his fathers fate
In this suspense bright Helen graced the room
Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume
So moves adornd with each attractive grace
The silver shafted goddess of the chase
The seat of majesty Adraste brings
With art illustrious for the pomp of kings
To spread the pall beneath the regal chair
Of softest wool is bright Alcippes care
A silver canister divinely wrought
In her soft hands the beauteous Phylo brought
To Spartas queen of old the radiant vase
Alcandra gave a pledge of royal grace
For Polybus her lord whose sovereign sway
The wealthy tribes of Pharian Thebes obey
When to that court Atrides came caressd
With vast munificence the imperial guest
Two lavers from the richest ore refined
With silver tripods the kind host assignd
And bounteous from the royal treasure told
Ten equal talents of refulgent gold
Alcandra consort of his high command
A golden distaff gave to Helens hand
And that rich vase with living sculpture wrought
Which heapd with wool the beauteous Phylo brought
The silken fleece impurpled for the loom
Rivalld the hyacinth in vernal bloom
The sovereign seat then Jove born Helen pressd
And pleasing thus her sceptred lord addressd

Who grace our palace now that friendly pair
Speak they their lineage or their names declare
Uncertain of the truth yet uncontrolld
Hear me the bodings of my breast unfold
With wonder wrappd on yonder check I trace
The feature of the Ulyssean race
Diffused oer each resembling line appear
In just similitude the grace and air
Of young Telemachus the lovely boy
Who blessd Ulysses with a fathers joy
What time the Greeks combined their social arms
To avenge the stain of my illfated charms

Just is thy thought the king assenting cries
Methinks Ulysses strikes my wondering eyes
Full shines the father in the filial frame
His port his features and his shape the same
Such quick regards his sparkling eyes bestow
Such wavy ringlets oer his shoulders flow
And when he heard the long disastrous store
Of cares which in my cause Ulysses bore
Dismayd heartwounded with paternal woes
Above restraint the tide of sorrow rose
Cautious to let the gushing grief appear
His purple garment veild the falling tear

See there confessd Pisistratus replies
The genuine worth of Ithacus the wise
Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung
But modest awe hath chaind his timorous tongue
Thy voice O king with pleased attention heard
Is like the dictates of a god revered
With him at Nestors high command I came
Whose age I honour with a parents name
By adverse destiny constrained to sue
For counsel and redress he sues to you
Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears
Bereaved of parents in his infant years
Still must the wrongd Telemachus sustain
If hopeful of your aid he hopes in vain
Affianced in your friendly power alone
The youth would vindicate the vacant throne

Is Sparta blest and these desiring eyes
View my friends son the king exalting cries
Son of my friend by glorious toils approved
Whose sword was sacred to the man he loved
Mirror of constant faith revered and mournd
When Troy was ruind had the chief returnd
No Greek an equal space had ere possessd
Of dear affection in my grateful breast
I to confirm the mutual joys we shared
For his abode a capital prepared
Argos the seat of sovereign rule I chose
Fair in the plan the future palace rose
Where my Ulysses and his race might reign
And portion to his tribes the wide domain
To them my vassals had resignd a soil
With teeming plenty to reward their toil
There with commutual zeal we both had strove
In acts of dear benevolence and love
Brothers in peace not rivals in command
And death alone dissolved the friendly band
Some envious power the blissful scene destroys
Vanishd are all the visionary joys
The soul of friendship to my hope is lost
Fated to wander from his natal coast

He ceased a gush of grief began to rise
Fast streams a tide from beauteous Helens eyes
Fast for the sire the filial sorrows flow
The weeping monarch swells the mighty woe
Thy cheeks Pisistratus the tears bedew
While pictured so thy mind appeard in view
Thy martial brother on the Phrygian plain
Extended pale by swarthy Memnon slain
But silence soon the son of Nestor broke
And melting with fraternal pity spoke

Frequent O king was Nestor wont to raise
And charm attention with thy copious praise
To crowd thy various gifts the sage assignd
The glory of a firm capacious mind
With that superior attribute control
This unavailing impotence of soul
Let not your roof with echoing grief resound
Now for the feast the friendly bowl is crownd
But when from dewy shade emerging bright
Aurora streaks the sky with orient light
Let each deplore his dead the rites of woe
Are all alas the living can bestow
Oer the congenial dust enjoind to shear
The graceful curl and drop the tender tear
Then mingling in the mournful pomp with you
Ill pay my brothers ghost a warriors due
And mourn the brave Antilochus a name
Not unrecorded in the rolls of fame
With strength and speed superior formd in fight
To face the foe or intercept his flight
Too early snatchd by fate ere known to me
I boast a witness of his worth in thee

Young and mature the monarch thus rejoins
In thee renewd the soul of Nestor shines
Formd by the care of that consummate sage
In early bloom an oracle of age
Wheneer his influence Jove vouchsafes to shower
To bless the natal and the nuptial hour
From the great sire transmissive to the race
The boon devolving gives distinguishd grace
Such happy Nestor was thy glorious doom
Around thee full of years thy offspring bloom
Expert of arms and prudent in debate
The gifts of Heaven to guard thy hoary state
But now let each becalm his troubled breast
Wash and partake serene the friendly feast
To move thy suit Telemachus delay
Till heavens revolving lamp restores the day

He said Asphalion swift the laver brings
Alternate all partake the grateful springs
Then from the rites of purity repair
And with keen gust the savoury viands share
Meantime with genial joy to warm the soul
Bright Helen mixd a mirth inspiring bowl
Temperd with drugs of sovereign use to assuage
The boiling bosom of tumultuous rage
To clear the cloudy front of wrinkled Care
And dry the tearful sluices of Despair
Charmd with that virtuous draught the exalted mind
All sense of woe delivers to the wind
Though on the blazing pile his parent lay
Or a loved brother groand his life away
Or darling son oppressd by ruffian force
Fell breathless at his feet a mangled corse
From morn to eve impassive and serene
The man entranced would view the dreadful scene
These drugs so friendly to the joys of life
Bright Helen learnd from Thones imperial wife
Who swayd the sceptre where prolific Nile
With various simples clothes the fattend soil
With wholesome herbage mixd the direful bane
Of vegetable venom taints the plain
From Paeon sprung their patrongod imparts
To all the Pharian race his healing arts
The beverage now prepared to inspire the feast
The circle thus the beauteous queen addressed

Throned in omnipotence supremest Jove
Tempers the fates of human race above
By the firm sanction of his sovereign will
Alternate are decreed our good and ill
To feastful mirth be this white hour assignd
And sweet discourse the banquet of the mind
Myself assisting in the social joy
Will tell Ulysses bold exploit in Troy
Sole witness of the deed I now declare
Speak you who saw his wonders in the war

Seamd oer with wounds which his own sabre gave
In the vile habit of a village slave
The foe deceived he passd the tented plain
In Troy to mingle with the hostile train
In this attire secure from searching eyes
Till happily piercing through the dark disguise
The chief I challenged he whose practised wit
Knew all the serpent mazes of deceit
Eludes my search but when his form I viewd
Fresh from the bath with fragrant oils renewd
His limbs in military purple dressd
Each brightening grace the genuine Greek confessd
A previous pledge of sacred faith obtaind
Till he the lines and Argive fleet regaind
To keep his stay conceald the chief declared
The plans of war against the town prepared
Exploring then the secrets of the state
He learnd what best might urge the Dardan fate
And safe returning to the Grecian host
Sent many a shade to Plutos dreary coast
Loud grief resounded through the towers of Troy
But my pleased bosom glowd with secret joy
For then with dire remorse and conscious shame
I viewd the effects of that disastrous flame
Which kindled by the imperious queen of love
Constraind me from my native realm to rove
And oft in bitterness of soul deplored
My absent daughter and my dearer lord
Admired among the first of human race
For every gift of mind and manly grace

Right well replied the king your speech displays
The matchless merit of the chief you praise
Heroes in various climes myself have found
For martial deeds and depth of thought renownd
But Ithacus unrivalld in his claim
May boast a title to the loudest fame
In battle calm he guides the rapid storm
Wise to resolve and patient to perform
What wondrous conduct in the chief appeard
When the vast fabric of the steed we reard
Some demon anxious for the Trojan doom
Urged you with great Deiphobus to come
To explore the fraud with guile opposed to guile
Slowpacing thrice around the insidious pile
Each noted leaders name you thrice invoke
Your accent varying as their spouses spoke
The pleasing sounds each latent warrior warmd
But most Tydides and coy heart alarmd
To quit the steed we both impatient press
Threatening to answer from the dark recess
Unmoved the mind of Ithacus remaind
And the vain ardours of our love restraind
But Anticlus unable to control
Spoke loud the language of his yearning soul
Ulysses straight with indignation fired
For so the common care of Greece required
Firm to his lips his forceful hands applied
Till on his tongue the fluttering murmurs died
Meantime Minerva from the fraudful horse
Back to the court of Priam bent your course

Inclement fate Telemachus replies
Frail is the boasted attribute of wise
The leader mingling with the vulgar host
Is in the common mass of matter lost
But now let sleep the painful waste repair
Of sad reflection and corroding care
He ceased the menial fair that round her wait
At Helens beck prepare the room of state
Beneath an ample portico they spread
The downy fleece to form the slumberous bed
And oer soft palls of purple grain unfold
Rich tapestry stiff with interwoven gold
Then through the illumined dome to balmy rest
The obsequious herald guides each princely guest
While to his regal bower the king ascends
And beauteous Helen on her lord attends
Soon as the morn in orient purple dressd
Unbarrd the portal of the roseate east
The monarch rose magnificent to view
The imperial mantle oer his vest he threw
The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast
A starry falchion lowdepending graced
Claspd on his feet the embroidered sandals shine
And forth he moves majestic and divine
Instant to young Telemachus he pressd
And thus benevolent his speech addressed

Say royal youth sincere of soul report
Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court
Do public or domestic care constrain
This toilsome voyage oer the surgy main

O highlyflavourd delegate of Jove
Replies the prince inflamed with filial love
And anxious hope to hear my parents doom
A suppliant to your royal court I come
Our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race
With lawless riot and misrule disgrace
To pamperd insolence devoted fall
Prime of the flock and choicest of the stall
For wild ambition wings their bold desire
And all to mount the imperial bed aspire
But prostrate I implore O king relate
The mournful series of my fathers fate
Each known disaster of the man disclose
Born by his mother to a world of woes
Recite them nor in erring pity fear
To wound with storied grief the filial ear
If eer Ulysses to reclaim your right
Avowd his zeal in council or in fight
If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest
To the sires merit give the sons request

Deep from his inmost soul Atrides sighd
And thus indignant to the prince replied
Heavens would a soft inglorious dastard train
An absent heros nuptial joys profane
So with her young amid the woodland shades
A timorous hind the lions court invades
Leaves in the fatal lair the tender fawns
Climbs the green cliff or feeds the flowery lawns
Meantime returnd with dire remorseless sway
The monarchsavage rends the trembling prey
With equal fury and with equal fame
Ulysses soon shall reassert his claim
O Jove supreme whom gods and men revere
And thou to whom tis given to gild the sphere
With power congenial joind propitious aid
The chief adopted by the martial maid
Such to our wish the warrior soon restore
As when contending on the Lesbian shore
His prowess Philomelidies confessd
And loudacclaiming Greeks the victor blessd
Then soon the invaders of his bed and throne
Their love presumptuous shall with life atone
With patient ear O royal youth attend
The storied labour of thy fathers friend
Fruitful of deeds the copious tale is long
But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue
Learn what I heard the seaborn seer relate
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate

Long on the Egyptian coast by calms confined
Heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind
No vows had we preferrd nor victims slain
For this the gods each favouring gale restrain
Jealous to see their high behests obeyd
Severe if men the eternal rights evade
High oer a gulfy sea the Pharian isle
Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing Nile
Her distance from the shore the course begun
At dawn and ending with the setting sun
A galley measures when the stiffer gales
Rise on the poop and fully stretch the sails
There anchord vessels safe in harbour lie
Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply

And now the twentieth sun descending laves
His glowing axle in the western waves
Still with expanded sails we court in vain
Propitious winds to waft us oer the main
And the pale mariner at once deplores
His drooping vigour and exhausted stores
When lo a bright cerulean form appears
Proteus her sire divine With pity pressd
Me sole the daughter of the deep addressd
What time with hunger pined my absent mates
Roam the wide isle in search of rural cates
Bait the barbd steel and from the fishy flood
Appease the afflictive fierce desire of food

Whoeer thou art the azure goddess cries
Thy conduct illdeserves the praise of wise
Is death thy choice or misery thy boast
That here inglorious on a barren coast
Thy brave associates droop a meagre train
With famine pale and ask thy care in vain
Struck with the loud reproach I straight reply
Whateer thy title in thy native sky
A goddess sure for more than moral grace
Speaks thee descendant of ethereal race
Deem not that here of choice my fleet remains
Some heavenly power averse my stay constrains
O piteous of my fate vouchsafe to show
For whats sequesterd from celestial view
What power becalms the innavigable seas
What guilt provokes him and what vows appease

I ceased when affable the goddess cried
Observe and in the truths I speak confide
The oracular seer frequents the Pharian coast
From whose high bed my birth divine I boast
Proteus a name tremendous oer the main
The delegate of Neptunes watery reign
Watch with insidious care his known abode
There fast in chains constrain the various god
Who bound obedient to superior force
Unerring will prescribe your destined course
If studious on your realms you then demand
Their state since last you left your natal land
Instant the god obsequious will disclose
Bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes

She ceased and suppliant thus I made reply
O goddess I on thy aid my hopes rely
Dictate propitious to my duteous ear
What arts can captivate the changeful seer
For perilous the assay unheard the toil
To elude the prescience of a god by guile

Thus to the goddess mild my suit I end
Then she Obedient to my rule attend
When through the zone of heaven the mounted sun
Hath journeyed half and half remains to run
The seer while zephyrs curl the swelling deep
Basks on the breezy shore in grateful sleep
His oozy limbs Emerging from the wave
The Phocas swift surround his rocky cave
Frequent and full the consecrated train
Of her whose azure trident awes the main
There wallowing warm the enormous herd exhales
An oily steam and taints the noontide gales
To that recess commodious for surprise
When purple light shall next suffuse the skies
With me repair and from thy warriorband
Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command
Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil
For strong the god and perfected in guile
Strechd on the shelly shore he first surveys
The flouncing herd ascending from the seas
Their number summd reposed in sleep profound
The scaly charge their guardian god surround
So with his battening flocks the careful swain
Abides paviliond on the grassy plain
With powers united obstinately bold
Invade him couchd amid the scaly fold
Instant he wears elusive of the rape
The mimic force of every savage shape
Or glides with liquid lapse a murmuring stream
Or wrappd in flame he glows at every limb
Yet still retentive with redoubled might
Through each vain passive form constrain his flight
But when his native shape renamed he stands
Patient of conquest and your cause demands
The cause that urged the bold attempt declare
And soothe the vanquishd with a victors prayer
The bands releasd implore the seer to say
What godhead interdicts the watery way
Who straight propitious in prophetic strain
Will teach you to repass the unmeasured main
She ceased and bounding from the shelfy shore
Round the descending nymph the waves resounding roar

High wrappd in wonder of the future deed
with joy impetuous to the port I speed
The wants of nature with repast suffice
Till night with grateful shade involved the skies
And shed ambrosial dews Fast by the deep
Along the tented shore in balmy sleep
Our cares were lost When oer the eastern lawn
In saffron robes the daughter of the dawn
Advanced her rosy steps before the bay
Due ritual honours to the gods I pay
Then seek the place the seaborn nymph assignd
With three associates of undaunted mind
Arrived to form along the appointed strand
For each a bed she scoops the hilly sand
Then from her azure cave the finny spoils
Of four vast Phocae takes to veil her wiles
Beneath the finny spoils extended prone
Hard toil the prophets piercing eye to shun
New from the corse the scaly frauds diffuse
Unsavoury stench of oil and brackish ooze
But the bright seamaids gentle power implored
With nectard drops the sickening sense restored

Thus till the sun had travelld half the skies
Ambushd we lie and wait the bold emprise
When thronging quick to bask in open air
The flocks of ocean to the strand repair
Couchd on the sunny sand the monsters sleep
Then Proteus mounting from the hoary deep
Surveys his charge unknowing of deceit
In order told we make the sum complete
Pleased with the false review secure he lies
And leaden slumbers press his drooping eyes
Rushing impetuous forth we straight prepare
A furious onset with the sound of war
And shouting seize the god our force to evade
His various arts he soon resumes in aid
A lion now he curls a surgy mane
Sudden our hands a spotted paid restrain
Then armd with tusks and lightning in his eyes
A boars obscener shape the god belies
On spiry volumes there a dragon rides
Here from our strict embrace a stream he glides
At last sublime his stately growth he rears
A tree and welldissembled foliage wears
Vain efforts with superior power compressd
Me with reluctance thus the seer addressd
Say son of Atreus say what god inspired
This daring fraud and what the boon desired
I thus O thou whose certain eye foresees
The fixd event of fates remote decrees
After long woes and various toil endured
Still on this desert isle my fleet is moord
Unfriended of the gales Allknowing say
What godhead interdicts the watery way
What vows repentant will the power appease
To speed a prosperous voyage oer the seas

To Jove with stern regard the god replies
And all the offended synod of the skies
Just hecatombs with due devotion slain
Thy guilt absolved a prosperous voyage gain
To the firm sanction of thy fate attend
An exile thou nor cheering face of friend
Nor sight of natal shore nor regal dome
Shalt yet enjoy but still art doomd to roam
Once more the Nile who from the secret source
Of Joves high seat descends with sweepy force
Must view his billows white beneath thy oar
And altars blaze along his sanguine shore
Then will the gods with holy pomp adored
To thy long vows a safe return accord

He ceased heart wounded with afflictive pain
Doomd to repeat the perils of the main
A shelfy track and long O seer I cry
To the stern sanction of the offended sky
My prompt obedience bows But deign to say
What fate propitious or what dire dismay
Sustain those peers the relics of our host
Whom I with Nestor on the Phrygian coast
Embracing left Must I the warriors weep
Whelmd in the bottom of the monstrous deep
Or did the kind domestic friend deplore
The breathless heroes on their native shore

Press not too far replied the god but cease
To know what known will violate thy peace
Too curious of their doom with friendly woe
Thy breast will heave and tears eternal flow
Part live the rest a lamentable train
Range the dark bounds of Plutos dreary reign
Two foremost in the roll of Mars renownd
Whose arms with conquest in thy cause were crownd
Fell by disastrous fate by tempests tossd
A third lives wretched on a distant coast

By Neptune rescued from Minervas hate
On Gyrae safe Oilean Ajax sate
His ship oerwhelmd but frowning on the floods
Impious he roard defiance to the gods
To his own prowess all the glory gave
The power defrauding who vouchsafed to save
This heard the raging ruler of the main
His spear indignant for such high disdain
He launched dividing with his forky mace
The aerial summit from the marble base
The rock rushd seaward with impetuous roar
Ingulfd and to the abyss the boaster bore

By Junos guardian aid the watery vast
Secure of storms your royal brother passd
Till coasting nigh the cape where Malen shrouds
Her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds
A whirling gust tumultuous from the shore
Across the deep his labouring vessel bore
In an illfated hour the coast he gaind
Where late in regal pomp Thyestes reigned
But when his hoary honours bowd to fate
Aegysthus governd in paternal state
The surges now subside the tempest ends
From his tall ship the king of men descends
There fondly thinks the gods conclude his toil
Far from his own domain salutes the soil
With rapture oft the urge of Greece reviews
And the dear turf with tears of joy bedews
Him thus exulting on the distant stand
A spy distinguishd from his airy stand
To bribe whose vigilance Aegysthus told
A mighty sum of illpersuading gold
There watchd this guardian of his guilty fear
Till the twelfth moon had wheeld her pale career
And now admonishd by his eye to court
With terror wingd conveys the dread report
Of deathful arts expert his lord employs
The ministers of blood in dark surprise
And twenty youths in radiant mail incased
Close ambushd nigh the spacious hall he placed
Then bids prepare the hospitable treat
Vain shows of love to veil his felon hate
To grace the victors welcome from the wars
A train of coursers and triumphal cars
Magnificent he leads the royal guest
Thoughtless of ill accepts the fraudful feast
The troop forthissuing from the dark recess
With homicidal rage the king oppress
So whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall
The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall
The partners of his fame and toils at Troy
Around their lord a mighty ruin lie
Mixd with the brave the base invaders bleed
Aegysthus sole survives to boast the deed

He said chill horrors shook my shivering soul
Rackd wish convulsive pangs in dust I roll
And hate in madness of extreme despair
To view the sun or breathe the vital air
But when superior to the rage of woe
I stood restored and tears had ceased to flow
Lenient of grief the pitying god began
Forget the brother and resume the man
To Fates supreme dispose the dead resign
That care be Fates a speedy passage thine
Still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplored
But lives a victim for thy vengeful sword
Unless with filial rage Orestes glow
And swift prevent the meditated blow
You timely will return a welcome guest
With him to share the sad funereal feast

He said new thoughts my beating heart employ
My gloomy soul receives a gleam of joy
Fair hope revives and eager I addressd
The prescient godhead to reveal the rest
The doom decreed of those disastrous two
Ive heard with pain but oh the tale pursue
What third brave son of Mars the Fates constrain
To roam the howling desert of the main
Or in eternal shade of cold he lies
Provoke new sorrows from these grateful eyes

That chief rejoind the god his race derives
From Ithaca and wondrous woes survives
Laertes son girt with circumfluous tides
He still calamitous constraint abides
Him in Calypsos cave of late viewd
When streaming grief his faded cheek bedowd
But vain his prayer his arts are vain to move
The enamourd goddess or elude her love
His vessel sunk and dear companions lost
He lives reluctant on a foreign coast
But oh beloved by Heaven reserved to thee
A happier lot the smiling Fates decree
Free from that law beneath whose mortal sway
Matter is changed and varying forms decay
Elysium shall be thine the blissful plains
Of utmost earth where Rhadamanthus reigns
Joys ever young unmixd with pain or fear
Fill the wide circle of the eternal year
Stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime
The fields are florid with unfading prime
From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow
Mould the round hail or flake the fleecy snow
But from the breezy deep the blest inhale
The fragrant murmurs of the western gale
This grace peculiar will the gods afford
To thee the son of Jove and beauteous Helens lord

He ceased and plunging in the vast profound
Beneath the god and whirling billows bound
Then speeding back involved in various thought
My friends attending at the shore I sought
Arrived the rage of hunger we control
Till night with silent shade invests the pole
Then lose the cares of life in pleasing rest
Soon as the morn reveals the roseate east
With sails we wing the masts our anchors weigh
Unmoor the fleet and rush into the sea
Ranged on the banks beneath our equal oars
White curl the waves and the vexd ocean roars
Then steering backward from the Pharian isle
We gain the stream of Jovedescended Nile
There quit the ships and on the destined shore
With ritual hecatombs the gods adore
Their wrath atoned to Agamemnons name
A cenotaph I raise of deathless fame
These rites to piety and grief discharged
The friendly gods a springing gale enlarged
The fleet swift tilting oer the surges flew
Till Grecian cliffs appeard a blissful view

Thy patient ear hath heard me long relate
A story fruitful of disastrous fate
And now young prince indulge my fond request
Be Sparta honoured with his royal guest
Till from his eastern goal the joyous sun
His twelfth diurnal race begins to run
Meantime my train the friendly gifts prepare
The sprightly coursers and a polishd car
With these a goblet of capacious mould
Figured with art to dignify the gold
Formd for libation to the gods shall prove
A pledge and monument of sacred love

My quick return young Ithacus rejoind
Damps the warm wishes of my raptured mind
Did not my fate my needful haste constrain
Charmd by your speech so graceful and humane
Lost in delight the circling year would roll
While deep attention fixd my listening soul
But now to Pyle permit my destined way
My loved associates chide my long delay
In dear remembrance of your royal grace
I take the present of the promised vase
The coursers for the champaign sports retain
That gift our barren rocks will render vain
Horrid with cliffs our meagre land allows
Thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse
But neither mead nor plain supplies to feed
The sprightly courser or indulge his speed
To seasurrounded realms the gods assign
Small tract of fertile lawn the least to mine

His hand the king with tender passion pressd
And smiling thus the royal youth addressd
O early worth a soul so wise and young
Proclaims you from the sage Ulysses sprung
Selected from my stores of matchless price
An urn shall recompense your prudent choice
By Vulcans art the verge with gold enchased
A pledge the sceptred power of Sidon gave
When to his realm I ploughd the orient wave

Thus they alternate while with artful care
The menial train the regal feast prepare
The firstlings of the flock are doomd to die
Rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply
A female band the gift of Ceres bring
And the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring

Meanwhile in Ithaca the suitor powers
In active games divide their jovial hours
In areas varied with mosaic art
Some whirl the disk and some the javelin dart
Aside sequesterd from the vast resort
Antinous sole spectator of the sport
With great Eurymachus of worth confessd
And high descent superior to the rest
Whom young Noemon lowly thus addressd

My ship equippd within the neighboring port
The prince departing for the Pylian court
Requested for his speed but courteous say
When steers he home or why this long delay
For Elis I should sail with utmost speed
To import twelve mares which there luxurious feed
And twelve young mules a strong laborious race
New to the plow unpractised in the trace

Unknowing of the course to Pyle designd
A sudden horror seized on either mind
The prince in rural bower they fondly thought
Numbering his flocks and herds not far remote
Relate Antinous cries devoid of guile
When spread the prince his sale for distant Pyle
Did chosen chiefs across the gulfy main
Attend his voyage or domestic train
Spontaneous did you speed his secret course
Or was the vessel seized by fraud or force

With willing duty not reluctant mind
Noemon cried the vessel was resignd
Who in the balance with the great affairs
Of courts presume to weigh their private cares
With him the peerage next in power to you
And Mentor captain of the lordly crew
Or some celestial in his reverend form
Safe from the secret rock and adverse storm
Pilots the course for when the glimmering ray
Of yester dawn disclosed the tender day
Mentor himself I saw and much admired
Then ceased the youth and from the court retired

Confounded and appalld the unfinishd game
The suitors quit and all to council came
Antinous first the assembled peers addressd
Rage sparkling in his eyes and burning in his breast

O shame to manhood shall one daring boy
The scheme of all our happiness destroy
Fly unperceived seducing half the flower
Of nobles and invite a foreign power
The ponderous engine raised to crush us all
Recoiling on his head is sure to fall
Instant prepare me on the neighbouring strand
With twenty chosen mates a vessel mannd
For ambushd close beneath the Samian shore
His ship returning shall my spies explore
He soon his rashness shall with life atone
Seek for his fathers fate but find his own

With vast applause the sentence all approve
Then rise and to the feastful hall remove
Swift to the queen the herald Medon ran
Who heard the consult of the dire divan
Before her dome the royal matron stands
And thus the message of his haste demands

What will the suitors must my servanttrain
The allotted labours of the day refrain
For them to form some exquisite repast
Heaven grant this festival may prove their last
Or if they still must live from me remove
The double plague of luxury and love
Forbear ye sons of insolence forbear
In riot to consume a wretched heir
In the young soul illustrious thought to raise
Were ye not tutord with Ulysses praise
Have not your fathers oft my lord defined
Gentle of speech beneficent of mind
Some kings with arbitrary rage devour
Or in their tyrantminions vest the power
Ulysses let no partial favours fall
The peoples parent he protected all
But absent now perfidious and ingrate
His stores ye ravage and usurp his state

He thus O were the woes you speak the worst
They form a deed more odious and accursed
More dreadful than your boding soul divines
But pitying Jove avert the dire designs
The darling object of your royal care
Is marked to perish in a deathful snare
Before he anchors in his native port
From Pyle resailing and the Spartan court
Horrid to speak in ambush is decreed
The hope and heir of Ithaca to bleed

Sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes
The vital streams a chilling horror froze
The big round tear stands trembling in her eye
And on her tongue imperfect accents die
At length in tender language interwove
With sighs she thus expressed her anxious love
Why rarely would my son his fate explore
Ride the wild waves and quit the safer shore
Did he with all the greatly wretched crave
A blank oblivion and untimely grave

Tis not replied the sage to Medon given
To know if some inhabitant of heaven
In his young breast the daring thought inspired
Or if alone with filial duty fired
The winds end waves he tempts in early bloom
Studious to learn his absent fathers doom

The sage retired unable to control
The mighty griefs that swell her labouring soul
Rolling convulsive on the floor is seen
The piteous object of a prostrate queen
Words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies
And breath to waste in unavailing cries
Around their sovereign wept the menial fair
To whom she thus addressd her deep despair

Behold a wretch whom all the gods consign
To woe Did ever sorrows equal mine
Long to my joys my dearest lord is lost
His countrys buckler and the Grecian boast
Now from my fond embrace by tempests torn
Our other column of the state is borne
Nor took a kind adieu nor sought consent
Unkind confederates in his dire intent
Ill suits it with your shows of duteous zeal
From me the purposed voyage to conceal
Though at the solemn midnight hour he rose
Why did you fear to trouble my repose
He either had obeyd my fond desire
Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire
Bid Dolius quick attend the faithful slave
Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave
To tend the fruit groves with incessant speed
He shall this violence of death decreed
To good Laertes tell Experienced age
May timely intercept the ruffian rage
Convene the tribes the murderous plot reveal
And to their power to save his race appeal

Then Euryclea thus My dearest dread
Though to the sword I bow this hoary head
Or if a dungeon be the pain decreed
I own me conscious of the unpleasing deed
Auxiliar to his flight my aid implored
With wine and viands I the vessel stored
A solemn oath imposed the secret seald
Till the twelfth dawn the light of day reveald
Dreading the effect of a fond mothers fear
He dared not violate your royal ear
But bathe and in imperial robes arrayd
Pay due devotions to the martial maid
And rest affianced in her guardian aid
Send not to good Laertes nor engage
In toils of state the miseries of age
Tis impious to surmise the powers divine
To ruin doom the Jovedescended line
Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign
And isles remote enlarge his old domain

The queen her speech with calm attention hears
Her eyes restrain the silverstreaming tears
She bathes and robed the sacred dome ascends
Her pious speed a female train attends
The salted cakes in canisters are laid
And thus the queen invokes Minervas aid

Daughter divine of Jove whose arm can wield
The avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
If eer Ulysses to thy fane preferrd
The best and choicest of his flock and herd
Hear goddess hear by those oblations won
And for the pious sire preserve the son
His wishd return with happy power befriend
And on the suitors let thy wrath descend

She ceased shrill ecstasies of joy declare
The favouring goddess present to the prayer
The suitors heard and deemd the mirthful voice
A signal of her hymeneal choice
Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board

Too late the queen selects a second lord
In evil hour the nuptial rite intends
When oer her son disastrous death impends
Thus he unskilld of what the fates provide
But with severe rebuke Antinous cried

These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain
Alarm not with discourse the menial train
The great event with silent hope attend
Our deeds alone our counsel must commend
His speech thus ended short he frowning rose
And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose
Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides
Where anchord in the bay the vessel rides
Replete with mail and military store
In all her tackle trim to quit the shore
The desperate crew ascend unfurl the sails
The seaward prow invites the tardy gales
Then take repast till Hesperus displayd
His golden circlet in the western shade

Meantime the queen without reflection due
Heartwounded to the bed of state withdrew
In her sad breast the princes fortunes roll
And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul
So when the woodmans toil her cave surrounds
And with the hunters cry the grove resounds
With grief and rage the motherlion stung
Fearless herself yet trembles for her young
While pensive in the silent slumberous shade
Sleeps gentle powers her drooping eyes invade
Minerva lifelike on embodied air
Impressd the form of Iphthima the fair
Icarius daughter she whose blooming charms
Allured Eumelus to her virgin arms
A sceptred lord who oer the fruitful plain
Of Thessaly wide stretched his ample reign
As Pallas willd along the sable skies
To calm the queen the phantom sister flies
Swift on the regal dome descending right
The bolted valves are pervious to her flight
Close to her head the pleasing vision stands
And thus performs Minervas high commands

O why Penelope this causeless fear
To render sleeps soft blessing unsincere
Alike devote to sorrows dire extreme
The dayreflection and the midnightdream
Thy son the gods propitious will restore
And bid thee cease his absence to deplore

To whom the queen whilst yet in pensive mind
Was in the silent gates of sleep confined
O sister to my soul forever dear
Why this first visit to reprove my fear
How in a realm so distant should you know
From what deep source ceaseless sorrows flow
To all my hope my royal lord is lost
His countrys buckler and the Grecian boast
And with consummate woe to weigh me down
The heir of all his honours and his crown
My darling son is fled an easy prey
To the fierce storms or men more fierce than they
Who in a league of blood associates sworn
Will intercept the unwary youths return

Courage resume the shadowy form replied
In the protecting care of Heaven confide
On him attends the blue eyed martial maid
What earthly can implore a surer aid
Me now the guardian goddess deigns to send
To bid thee patient his return attend

The queen replies If in the blest abodes
A goddess thou hast commerce with the gods
Say breathes my lord the blissful realm of light
Or lies he wrappd in everduring night

Inquire not of his doom the phantom cries
I speak not all the counsel of the skies
Nor must indulge with vain discourse or long
The windy satisfaction of the tongue

Swift through the valves the visionary fair
Repassd and viewless mixd with common air
The queen awakes deliverd of her woes
With florid joy her heart dilating glows
The vision manifest of future fate
Makes her with hope her sons arrival wait

Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain
Telemachus in thought already slain
When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost
Their sail directed for the Samian coast
A small but verdant isle appeard in view
And Asteris the advancing pilot knew
An ample port the rocks projected form
To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm
That safe recess they gain with happy speed
And in close ambush wait the murderous deed



BOOK V

ARGUMENT

THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO

Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of
Ulysses in the Island of Calypso whereupon Mercury is sent to
command his removal The seat of Calypso described She consents
with much difficulty and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own
hands in which he embarks Neptune overtakes him with a terrible
tempest in which he is shipwrecked and in the last danger of
death till Lencothea a seagoddess assists him and after
innumerable perils he gets ashore on Phaeacia



The saffron morn with early blushes spread
Now rose refulgent from Tithonus bed
With newborn day to gladden mortal sight
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light
Then met the eternal synod of the sky
Before the god who thunders from on high
Supreme in might sublime in majesty
Pallas to these deplores the unequal fates
Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates
Her heros danger touchd the pitying power
The nymphs seducements and the magic bower
Thus she began her plaint Immortal Jove
And you who fill the blissful seats above
Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway
Or bless a people willing to obey
But crush the nations with an iron rod
And every monarch be the scourge of God
If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove
Who ruled his subjects with a fathers love
Sole in an isle encircled by the main
Abandond banishd from his native reign
Unblessd he sighs detained by lawless charms
And pressd unwilling in Calypsos arms
Nor friends are there nor vessels to convey
Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way
And now fierce traitors studious to destroy
His only son their ambushd fraud employ
Who pious following his great fathers fame
To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came

What words are these replied the power who forms
The clouds of night and darkens heaven with storms
Is not already in thy soul decreed
The chiefs return shall make the guilty bleed
What cannot Wisdom do Thou mayst restore
The son in safety to his native shore
While the fell foes who late in ambush lay
With fraud defeated measure back their way

Then thus to Hermes the command was given
Hermes thou chosen messenger of heaven
Go to the nymph be these our orders borne
Tis Joves decree Ulysses shall return
The patient man shall view his old abodes
Nor helped by mortal hand nor guiding gods
In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find
Alone and floating to the wave and wind
The bold Phaecians there whose haughty line
Is mixed with gods half human half divine
The chief shall honour as some heavenly guest
And swift transport him to his place of rest
His vessels loaded with a plenteous store
Of brass of vestures and resplendent ore
A richer prize than if his joyful isle
Received him charged with Ilions noble spoil
His friends his country he shall see though late
Such is our sovereign will and such is fate

He spoke The god who mounts the winged winds
Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds
That high through fields of air his flight sustain
Oer the wide earth and oer the boundless main
He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly
Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye
Then shoots from heaven to high Pierias steep
And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep
So watery fowl that seek their fishy food
With wings expanded oer the foaming flood
Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep
Now dip their pinions in the briny deep
Thus oer the word of waters Hermes flew
Till now the distant island rose in view
Then swift ascending from the azure wave
he took the path that winded to the cave
Large was the grot in which the nymph he found
The fairhaird nymph with every beauty crownd
The cave was brightend with a rising blaze
Cedar and frankincense an odorous pile
Flamed on the hearth and wide perfumed the isle
While she with work and song the time divides
And through the loom the golden shuttle guides
Without the grot a various sylvan scene
Appeard around and groves of living green
Poplars and alders ever quivering playd
And nodding cypress formd a fragrant shade
On whose high branches waving with the storm
The birds of broadest wing their mansions form
The chough the seamew the loquacious crow
and scream aloft and skim the deeps below
Depending vines the shelving cavern screen
With purple clusters blushing through the green
Four limped fountains from the clefts distil
And every fountain pours a several rill
In mazy windings wandering down the hill
Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crownd
And glowing violets threw odours round
A scene where if a god should cast his sight
A god might gaze and wander with delight
Joy touchd the messenger of heaven he stayd
Entranced and all the blissful haunts surveyed
Him entering in the cave Calypso knew
For powers celestial to each others view
Stand still confessd though distant far they lie
To habitants of earth or sea or sky
But sad Ulysses by himself apart
Pourd the big sorrows of his swelling heard
All on the lonely shore he sate to weep
And rolld his eyes around the restless deep
Toward his loved coast he rolld his eyes in vain
Till dimmd with rising grief they streamd again

Now graceful seated on her shining throne
To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun

God of the golden wand on what behest
Arrivest thou here an unexpected guest
Loved as thou art thy free injunctions lay
Tis mine with joy and duty to obey
Till now a stranger in a happy hour
Approach and taste the dainties of my bower

Thus having spoke the nymph the table spread
Ambrosial cates with nectar rosyred
Hermes the hospitable rite partook
Divine refection then recruited spoke

What moves this journey from my native sky
A goddess asks nor can a god deny
Hear then the truth By mighty Joves command
Unwilling have I trod this pleasing land
For who selfmoved with weary wing would sweep
Such length of ocean and unmeasured deep
A world of waters far from all the ways
Where men frequent or sacred altars blaze
But to Joves will submission we must pay
What power so great to dare to disobey
A man he says a man resides with thee
Of all his kind most worn with misery
The Greeks whose arms for nine long year employd
Their force on Ilion in the tenth destroyd
At length embarking in a luckless hour
With conquest proud incensed Minervas power
Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurld
With storms pursued them through the liquid world
There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave
There all his dear companions found their grave
Saved from the jaws of death by Heavens decree
The tempest drove him to these shores and thee
Him Jove now orders to his native lands
Straight to dismiss so destiny commands
Impatient Fate his near return attends
And calls him to his country and his friends

Een to her inmost soul the goddess shook
Then thus her anguish and her passion broke
Ungracious gods with spite and envy cursed
Still to your own ethereal race the worst
Ye envy mortal and immortal joy
And love the only sweet of life destroy
Did ever goddess by her charms engage
A favourd mortal and not feel your rage
So when Aurora sought Orions love
Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above
Till in Ortygia Dians winged dart
Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart
So when the covert of the thriceeared field
Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield
Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms
But Joves swift lightning scorched him in her arms
And is it now my turn ye mighty powers
Am I the envy of your blissful bowers
A man an outcast to the storm and wave
It was my crime to pity and to save
When he who thunders rent his bark in twain
And sunk his brave companions in the main
Alone abandond in midocean tossed
The sport of winds and driven from every coast
Hither this man of miseries I led
Received the friendless and the hungry fed
Nay promised vainly promised to bestow
Immortal life exempt from age and woe
Tis pastand Jove decrees he shall remove
Gods as we are we are but slaves to Jove
Go then he must he must if he ordain
Try all those dangers all those deeps again
But never never shall Calypso send
To toils like these her husband and her friend
What ships have I what sailors to convey
What oars to cut the long laborious way
Yet Ill direct the safest means to go
That last advice is all I can bestow

To her the power who hears the charming rod
Dismiss the man nor irritate the god
Prevent the rage of him who reigns above
For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove
Thus having said he cut the cleaving sky
And in a moment vanished from her eye
The nymph obedient to divine command
To seek Ulysses paced along the sand
Him pensive on the lonely beach she found
With streaming eyes in briny torrents drownd
And inly pining for his native shore
For now the soft enchantress pleased no more
For now reluctant and constrained by charms
Absent he lay in her desiring arms
In slumber wore the heavy night away
On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day
There sate all desolate and sighed alone
With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan
And rolld his eyes oer all the restless main
Till dimmed with rising grief they streamed again

Here on his musing mood the goddess pressd
Approaching soft and thus the chief addressd
Unhappy man to wasting woes a prey
No more in sorrows languish life away
Free as the winds I give thee now to rove
Go fell the timber of yon lofty grove
And form a raft and build the rising ship
Sublime to bear thee oer the gloomy deep
To store the vessel let the care be mine
With water from the rock and rosy wine
And lifesustaining bread and fair array
And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way
These if the gods with my desire comply
The gods alas more mighty far than I
And better skilld in dark events to come
In peace shall land thee at thy native home

With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke
Then thus his melancholy silence broke
Some other motive goddess sways thy mind
Some close design or turn of womankind
Nor my return the end nor this the way
On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea
Huge horrid vast where scarce in safety sails
The bestbuilt ship though Jove inspires the gales
The bold proposal how shall I fulfil
Dark as I am unconscious of thy will
Swear then thou meanst not what my soul forebodes
Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods

Him while he spoke with smiles Calypso eyed
And gently graspd his hand and thus replied
This shows thee friend by old experience taught
And learnd in all the wiles of human thought
How prone to doubt how cautious are the wise
But hear O earth and hear ye sacred skies
And thou O Styx whose formidable floods
Glide through the shades and bind the attesting gods
No formd design no meditated end
Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend
Kind the persuasion and sincere my aim
The same my practice were my fate the same
Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel
But given the sense to pity and to feel

Thus having said the goddess marched before
He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore
At the cool cave arrived they took their state
He filled the throne where Mercury had sate
For him the nymph a rich repast ordains
Such as the mortal life of man sustains
Before herself were placed the the cates divine
Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine
Their hunger satiate and their thirst repressd
Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest

Ulysses with a sigh she thus began
O sprung from gods in wisdom more than man
Is then thy home the passion of thy heart
Thus wilt thou leave me are we thus to part
Farewell and ever joyful mayst thou be
Nor break the transport with one thought of me
But ah Ulysses wert thou given to know
What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo
Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease
And een these slighted charms might learn to please
A willing goddess and immortal life
Might banish from thy mind an absent wife
Am I inferior to a mortal dame
Less soft my feature less august my frame
Or shall the daughters of mankind compare
Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair

Alas for this the prudent man replies
Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise
Loved and adored O goddess as thou art
Forgive the weakness of a human heart
Though well I see thy graces far above
The dear though mortal object of my love
Of youth eternal well the difference know
And the short date of fading charms below
Yet every day while absent thus I roam
I languish to return and die at home
Whateer the gods shall destine me to bear
In the black ocean or the watery war
Tis mine to master with a constant mind
Inured to perils to the worst resignd
By seas by wars so many dangers run
Still I can suffer their high will he done

Thus while he spoke the beamy sun descends
And rising night her friendly shade extends
To the close grot the lonely pair remove
And slept delighted with the gifts of love
When rose morning calld them from their rest
Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest
The nymphs fair head a veil transparent graced
Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced
With flowers of gold an under robe unbound
In snowy waves flowd glittering on the ground
Forth issuing thus she gave him first to wield
A weighty axe with truest temper steeled
And doubleedged the handle smooth and plain
Wrought of the clouded olives easy grain
And next a wedge to drive with sweepy sway
Then to the neighboring forest led the way
On the lone islands utmost verge there stood
Of poplars pine and firs a lofty wood
Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire
Scorchd by the sun or seared by heavenly fire
Already dried These pointing out to view
The nymph just showd him and with tears withdrew

Now toils the hero trees on trees oerthrown
Fall crackling round him and the forests groan
Sudden full twenty on the plain are strowd
And loppd and lightend of their branchy load
At equal angles these disposed to join
He smoothd and squared them by the rule and line
The wimbles for the work Calypso found
With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound
Long and capacious as a shipwright forms
Some barks broad bottom to outride the storms
So large he built the raft then ribbd it strong
From space to space and naild the planks along
These formd the sides the deck he fashiond last
Then oer the vessel raised the taper mast
With crossing sailyards dancing in the wind
And to the helm the guiding rudder joind
With yielding osiers fenced to break the force
Of surging waves and steer the steady course
Thy loom Calypso for the future sails
Supplied the cloth capacious of the gales
With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship
And rolld on levers launchd her in the deep

Four days were passd and now the work complete
Shone the fifth morn when from her sacred seat
The nymph dismissd him odorous garments given
And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven
Then filld two goatskins with her hands divine
With water one and one with sable wine
Of every kind provisions heaved aboard
And the full decks with copious viands stored
The goddess last a gentle breeze supplies
To curl old Ocean and to warm the skies

And now rejoicing in the prosperous gales
With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails
Placed at the helm he sate and markd the skies
Nor closed in sleep his everwatchful eyes
There viewd the Pleiads and the Northern Team
And great Orions more refulgent beam
To which around the axle of the sky
The Bear revolving points his golden eye
Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main
Far on the left those radiant fires to keep
The nymph directed as he saild the deep
Full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way
The distant land appeard the following day
Then swelld to sight Phaeacias dusky coast
And woody mountains half in vapours lost
That lay before him indistinct and vast
Like a broad shield amid the watery waste

But him thus voyaging the deeps below
From far on Solymes aerial brow
The king of ocean saw and seeing burnd
From AEthiopias happy climes returnd
The raging monarch shook his azure head
And thus in secret to his soul he said
Heavens how uncertain are the powers on high
Is then reversed the sentence of the sky
In one mans favour while a distant guest
I shared secure the AEthiopian feast
Behold how near Phoenecias land he draws
The land affixd by Fates eternal laws
To end his toils Is then our anger vain
No if this sceptre yet commands the main

He spoke and high the forky trident hurld
Rolls clouds on clouds and stirs the watery world
At once the face of earth and sea deforms
Swells all the winds and rouses all the storms
Down rushed the night east west together roar
And south and north roll mountains to the shore
Then shook the hero to despair resignd
And questiond thus his yet unconquerd mind

Wretch that I am what farther fates attend
This life of toils and what my destined end
Too well alas the island goddess knew
On the black sea what perils should ensue
New horrors now this destined head inclose
Untilld is yet the measure of my woes
With what a cloud the brows of heaven are crownd
What raging winds what roaring waters round
Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears
Death present death on every side appears
Happy thrice happy who in battle slain
Pressd in Atrides cause the Trojan plain
Oh had I died before that wellfought wall
Had some distinguishd day renownd my fall
Such as was that when showers of javelins fled
From conquering Troy around Achilles dead
All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then
And spread my glory with the sons of men
A shameful fate now hides my hapless head
Unwept unnoted and for ever dead

A mighty wave rushd oer him as he spoke
The raft is coverd and the mast is broke
Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn
Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne
While by the howling tempest rent in twain
Flew sail and sailyards rattling oer the main
Longpressd he heaved beneath the weighty wave
Cloggd by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave
At length emerging from his nostrils wide
And gushing mouth effused the briny tide
Een then not mindless of his last retreat
He seized the raft and leapd into his seat
Strong with the fear of death In rolling flood
Now here now there impelld the floating wood
As when a heap of gatherd thorns is cast
Now to now fro before the autumnal blast
Together clung it rolls around the field
So rolld the float and so its texture held
And now the south and now the north bear sway
And now the east the foamy floods obey
And now the west wind whirls it oer the sea
The wandering chief with toils on toils oppressd
Leucothea saw and pity touchd her breast
Herself a mortal once of Cadmus strain
But now an azure sister of the main
Swift as a seamew springing from the flood
All radiant on the raft the goddess stood
Then thus addressd him Thou whom heaven decrees
To Neptunes wrath stern tyrant of the seas
Unequal contest not his rage and power
Great as he is such virtue shall devour
What I suggest thy wisdom will perform
Forsake thy float and leave it to the storm
Strip off thy garments Neptunes fury brave
With naked strength and plunge into the wave
To reach Phaeacia all thy nerves extend
There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end
This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind
And live give all thy terrors to the wind
Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain
Return the gift and cast it in the main
Observe my orders and with heed obey
Cast it far off and turn thy eyes away

With that her hand the sacred veil bestows
Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose
A moment snatchd the shining form away
And all was covered with the curling sea

Struck with amaze yet still to doubt inclined
He stands suspended and explores his mind
What shall I do unhappy me who knows
But other gods intend me other woes
Whoeer thou art I shall not blindly join
Thy pleaded reason but consult with mine
For scarce in ken appears that distant isle
Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil
Thus then I judge while yet the planks sustain
The wild waves fury here I fixd remain
But when their texture to the tempest yields
I launch adventurous on the liquid fields
Join to the help of gods the strength of man
And take this method since the best I can

While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold
The raging god a watery mountain rolld
Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread
Burst oer the float and thunderd on his head
Planks beams disparted fly the scatterd wood
Rolls diverse and in fragments strews the flood
So the rude Boreas oer the field newshorn
Tosses and drives the scatterd heaps of corn
And now a single beam the chief bestrides
There poised a while above the bounding tides
His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest
And binds the sacred cincture round his breast
Then prone an ocean in a moment flung
Stretchd wide his eager arms and shot the seas along
All naked now on heaving billows laid
Stern Neptune eyed him and contemptuous said

Go learnd in woes and other foes essay
Go wander helpless on the watery way
Thus thus find out the destined shore and then
If Jove ordains it mix with happier men
Whateer thy fate the ills our wrath could raise
Shall last rememberd in thy best of days

This said his seagreen steeds divide the foam
And reach high Aegae and the towery dome
Now scarce withdrawn the fierce earthshaking power
Joves daughter Pallas watchd the favouring hour
Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly
And hushd the blustering brethren of the sky
The drier blasts alone of Boreas away
And bear him soft on broken waves away
With gentle force impelling to that shore
Where fate has destined he shall toil no more
And now two nights and now two days were passd
Since wide he wanderd on the watery waste
Heaved on the surge with intermitting breath
And hourly panting in the arms of death
The third fair morn now blazed upon the main
Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain
The winds were hushd the billows scarcely curld
And a dead silence stilld the watery world
When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies
The land at distance and with sharpend eyes
As pious children joy with vast delight
When a loved sire revives before their sight
Who lingering along has calld on death in vain
Fixd by some demon to his bed of pain
Till heaven by miracle his life restore
So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore
And sees and labours onward as he sees
The rising forests and the tufted trees
And now as near approaching as the sound
Of human voice the listening ear may wound
Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar
Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore
Nor peaceful port was there nor winding bay
To shield the vessel from the rolling sea
But cliffs and shaggy shores a dreadful sight
All rough with rocks with foamy billows white
Fear seized his slackend limbs and beating heart
As thus he communed with his soul apart

Ah me when oer a length of waters tossd
These eyes at last behold the unhopedfor coast
No port receives me from the angry main
But the loud deeps demand me back again
Above sharp rocks forbid access around
Roar the wild waves beneath is sea profound
No footing sure affords the faithless sand
To stem too rapid and too deep to stand
If here I enter my efforts are vain
Dashd on the cliffs or heaved into the main
Or round the island if my course I bend
Where the ports open or the shores descend
Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep
And bury all my hopes beneath the deep
Or some enormous whale the god may send
For many such an Amphitrite attend
Too well the turns of mortal chance I know
And hate relentless of my heavenly foe
While thus he thought a monstrous wave upbore
The chief and dashd him on the craggy shore
Torn was his skin nor had the ribs been whole
But Instant Pallas enterd in his soul
Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung
And stuck adherent and suspended hung
Till the huge surge rolld off then backward sweep
The refluent tides and plunge him in the deep
As when the polypus from forth his cave
Torn with full force reluctant beats the wave
His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands
So the rough rock had shaggd Ulysses hands
And now had perishd whelmd beneath the main
The unhappy man een fate had been in vain
But allsubduing Pallas lent her power
And prudence saved him in the needful hour
Beyond the beating surge his course he bore
A wider circle but in sight of shore
With longing eyes observing to survey
Some smooth ascent or safe sequesterd bay
Between the parting rocks at length he spied
A failing stream with gentler waters glide
Where to the seas the shelving shore declined
And formd a bay impervious to the wind
To this calm port the glad Ulysses pressd
And haild the river and its god addressd

Whoeer thou art before whose stream unknown
I bend a suppliant at thy watery throne
Hear azure king nor let me fly in vain
To thee from Neptune and the raging main
Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me
For sacred even to gods is misery
Let then thy waters give the weary rest
And save a suppliant and a man distressd

He prayd and straight the gentle stream subsides
Detains the rushing current of his tides
Before the wanderer smooths the watery way
And soft receives him from the rolling sea
That moment fainting as he touchd the shore
He droppd his sinewy arms his knees no more
Performd their office or his weight upheld
His swoln heart heaved his bloated body swelld
From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran
And lost in lassitude lay all the man
Deprived of voice of motion and of breath
The soul scarce waking in the arms of death
Soon as warm life its wonted office found
The mindful chief Leucotheas scarf unbound
Observant of her word he turnd aside
HIs head and cast it on the rolling tide
Behind him far upon the purple waves
The waters waft it and the nymph receives

Now parting from the stream Ulysses found
A mossy bank with pliant rushes crownd
The bank he pressd and gently kissd the ground
Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay
Thus to his soul the sage began to say

What will ye next ordain ye powers on high
And yet ah yet what fates are we to try
Here by the stream if I the night outwear
Thus spent already how shall nature bear
The dews descending and nocturnal air
Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood
When morning risesIf I take the wood
And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs
Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows
Though fenced from cold and though my toil be passd
What savage beasts may wander in the waste
Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey
To prowling bears or lions in the way

Thus long debating in himself he stood
At length he took the passage to the wood
Whose shady horrors on a rising brow
Waved high and frownd upon the stream below
There grew two olives closest of the grove
With roots entwined the branches interwove
Alike their leaves but not alike they smiled
With sisterfruits one fertile one was wild
Nor here the suns meridian rays had power
Nor wind sharppiercing nor the rushing shower
The verdant arch so close its texture kept
Beneath this covert great Ulysses crept
Of gatherd leaves an ample bed he made
Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade
Where three at least might winters cold defy
Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky
This store with joy the patient hero found
And sunk amidst them heapd the leaves around
As some poor peasant fated to reside
Remote from neighbours in a forest wide
Studious to save what human wants require
In embers heapd preserves the seeds of fire
Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies
Till Pallas pourd soft slumbers on his eyes
And golden dreams the gift of sweet repose
Lulld all his cares and banishd all his woes



BOOK VI

ARGUMENT

Pallas appearing in a dream in to Nausicaa the daughter of
Alcinous king of Phaeacia commands her to descend to the river
and wash the robes of state in preparation for her nuptials
Nausicaa goes with her handmaidens to the river where while the
garments are spread on the bank they divert themselves in sports
Their voices awaken Ulysses who addressing himself to the
princess is by her relieved and clothed and receives directions
in what manner to apply to the king and queen of the island



While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest
And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast
The martial maid from heavens aerial height
Swift to Phaeacia wingd her rapid flight
In elder times the soft Phaeacian train
In ease possessd the wide Hyperian plain
Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose
A lawless nation of gigantic foes
Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far
Through seas retreating from the sounds of war
The recreant nation to fair Scheria led
Where never science reard her laurelld head
There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised
To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed
Just to his realms he parted grounds from grounds
And shared the lands and gave the lands their bounds
Now in the silent grave the monarch lay
And wise Alcinous held the legal sway

To his high palace through the fields of air
The goddess shot Ulysses was her care
There as the night in silence rolld away
A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay
Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze
Two nymphs the portals guard each nymph a Grace
Light as the viewless air the warrior maid
Glides through the valves and hovers round her head
A favourite virgins blooming form she took
From Dymas sprung and thus the vision spoke

Oh Indolent to waste thy hours away
And sleepst thou careless of the bridal day
Thy spousal ornament neglected lies
Arise prepare the bridal train arise
A just applause the cares of dress impart
And give soft transport to a parents heart
Haste to the limpid stream direct thy way
When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray
Haste to the stream companion of thy care
Lo I thy steps attend thy labours share
Virgin awake the marriage hour is nigh
See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh
The royal car at early dawn obtain
And order mules obedient to the rein
For rough the way and distant rolls the wave
Where their fair vests Phaeacian virgins lave
In pomp ride forth for pomp becomes the great
And majesty derives a grace from state
Then to the palaces of heaven she sails
Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales
The seat of gods the regions mild of peace
Full joy and calm eternity of ease
There no rude winds presume to shake the skies
No rains descend no snowy vapours rise
But on immortal thrones the blest repose
The firmament with living splendours glows
Hither the goddess winged the aerial way
Through heavens eternal gates that blazed with day

Now from her rosy car Aurora shed
The dawn and all the orient flamed with red
Up rose the virgin with the morning light
Obedient to the vision of the night
The queen she sought the queen her hours bestowed
In curious works the whirling spindle glowd
With crimson threads while busy damsels call
The snowy fleece or twist the purpled wool
Meanwhile Phaeacias peers in council sate
From his high dome the king descends in state
Then with a filial awe the royal maid
Approachd him passing and submissive said

Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign
And may his child the royal car obtain
Say with my garments shall I bend my way
Where through the vales the mazy waters stray
A dignity of dress adorns the great
And kings draw lustre from the robe of state
Five sons thou hast three wait the bridal day
And spotless robes become the young and gay
So when with praise amid the dance they shine
By these my cares adornd that praise is mine

Thus she but blushes illrestraind betray
Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day
The conscious sire the dawning blush surveyd
And smiling thus bespoke the blooming maid
My child my darling joy the car receive
That and whateer our daughter asks we give
Swift at the royal nod the attending train
The car prepare the mules incessant rein
The blooming virgin with despatchful cares
Tunics and stoles and robes imperial bears
The queen assiduous to her train assigns
The sumptuous viands and the flavorous wines
The train prepare a cruse of curious mould
A cruse of fragrance formd of burnishd gold
Odour divine whose soft refreshing streams
Sleek the smooth skin and scent the snowy limbs

Now mounting the gay seat the silken reins
Shine in her hand along the sounding plains
Swift fly the mules nor rode the nymph alone
Around a bevy of bright damsels shone
They seek the cisterns where Phaeacian dames
Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams
Where gathering into depth from falling rills
The lucid wave a spacious bason fills
The mules unharnessd range beside the main
Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain

Then emulous the royal robes they lave
And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave
The vestures cleansed oerspread the shelly sand
Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand
Then with a short repast relieve their toil
And oer their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil
And while the robes imbibe the solar ray
Oer the green mead the sporting virgins play
Their shining veils unbound Along the skies
Tossd and retossd the ball incessant flies
They sport they feast Nausicaa lifts her voice
And warbling sweet makes earth and heaven rejoice

As when oer Erymanth Diana roves
Or wide Tuygetus resounding groves
A sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds
Her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds
Fierce in the sport along the mountains brow
They bay the boar or chase the bounding roe
High oer the lawn with more majestic pace
Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace
Distinguishd excellence the goddess proves
Exults Latona as the virgin moves
With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain
And shone transcendent oer the beauteous train

Meantime the care and favourite of the skies
Wrappd in imbowering shade Ulysses lies
His woes forgot but Pallas now addressd
To break the bands of allcomposing rest
Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw
The various ball the ball erroneous flew
And swam the stream loud shrieks the virgin train
And the loud shriek redoubles from the main
Waked by the shrilling sound Ulysses rose
And to the deaf woods wailing breathed his woes

Ah me on what inhospitable coast
On what new region is Ulysses tossd
Possessd by wild barbarians fierce in arms
Or men whose bosom tender pity warms
What sounds are these that gather from he shores
The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers
The fairhaird Dryads of the shady wood
Or azure daughters of the silver flood
Or human voice but issuing from the shades
Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades

Then where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends
With forceful strength a branch the hero rends
Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads
A wreathy foliage and concealing shades
As when a lion in the midnight hours
Beat by rude blasts and wet with wintry showers
Descends terrific from the mountains brow
With living flames his rolling eye balls glow
With conscious strength elate he bends his way
Majestically fierce to seize his prey
The steer or stag or with keen hunger bold
Spring oer the fence and dissipates the fold
No less a terror from the neighbouring groves
Rough from the tossing surge Ulysses moves
Urged on by want and recent from the storms
The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms
Wide oer the shore with many a piercing cry
To rocks to caves the frightened virgins fly
All but the nymph the nymph stood fixd alone
By Pallas armd with boldness not her own
Meantime in dubious thought the king awaits
And selfconsidering as he stands debates
Distant his mournful story to declare
Or prostrate at her knee address the prayer
But fearful to offend by wisdom swayd
At awful distance he accosts the maid

If from the skies a goddess or if earth
Imperial virgin boast thy glorious birth
To thee I bend If in that bright disguise
Thou visit earth a daughter of the skies
Hail Dian hail the huntress of the groves
So shines majestic and so stately moves
So breathes an air divine But if thy race
Be mortal and this earth thy native place
Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung
Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung
Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide
To such a miracle of charms allied
Joyful they see applauding princes gaze
When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze
But blest oer all the youth with heavenly charms
Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms
Never I never viewd till this blast hour
Such finishd grace I gaze and I adore
Thus seems the palm with stately honours crownd
By Phoebus altars thus oerlooks the ground
The pride of Delos By the Delian coast
I voyaged leader of a warriorhost
But ah how changed I from thence my sorrow flows
O fatal voyage source of all my woes
Raptured I stood and as this hour amazed
With reverence at the lofty wonder gazed
Raptured I stand for earth neer knew to bear
A plant so stately or a nymph so fair
Awed from access I lift my suppliant hands
For Misery O queen before thee stands
Twice ten tempestuous nights I rolld resignd
To roaring blows and the warring wind
Heaven bade the deep to spare but heaven my foe
Spares only to inflict some mightier woe
Inured to cares to death in all its forms
Outcast I rove familiar with the storms
Once more I view the face of human kind
Oh let soft pity touch thy generous mind
Unconscious of what air I breathe I stand
Naked defenceless on a narrow land
Propitious to my wants a vest supply
To guard the wretched from the inclement sky
So may the gods who heaven and earth control
Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul
On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed
Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed
Blest be thy husband with a blooming race
And lasting union crown your blissful days
The gods when they supremely bless bestow
Firm union on their favourites below
Then envy grieves with inlypining hate
The good exult and heaven is in our state

To whom the nymph O stranger cease thy care
Wise is thy soul but man is bore to bear
Jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales
And the good suffers while the bad prevails
Bear with a soul resignd the will of Jove
Who breathes must mourn thy woes are from above
But since thou treadst our hospitable shore
Tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more
To clothe the naked and thy way to guide
Know the Phaecian tribes this land divide
From great Alcinous royal loins I spring
A happy nation and a happy king

Then to her maids Why why ye coward train
These fears this flight ye fear and fly in vain
Dread ye a foe dismiss that idle dread
Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread
Safe in the love of heaven an ocean flows
Around our realm a barrier from the foes
Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve
Cheer the sad heart nor let affliction grieve
By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent
And what to those we give to Jove is lent
Then food supply and bathe his fainting limbs
Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams

Obedient to the call the chief they guide
To the calm current of the secret tide
Close by the stream a royal dress they lay
A vest and robe with rich embroidery gay
Then unguents in a vase of gold supply
That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky

To them the king No longer I detain
Your friendly care retire ye virgin train
Retire while from my wearied limbs I lave
The foul pollution of the briny wave
Ye gods since this worn frame refection know
What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view
But nymphs recede sage chastity denies
To raise the blush or pain the modest eyes

The nymphs withdrawn at once into the tide
Active he bounds the flashing waves divide
Oer all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse
And from his locks compress the weedy ooze
The balmy oil a fragrant shower be sheds
Then dressed in pomp magnificently treads
The warriorgoddess gives his frame to shine
With majesty enlarged and air divine
Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls
His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls
As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives
His skill divine a breathing statue lives
By Pallas taught he frames the wondrous mould
And oer the silver pours the fusile gold
So Pallas his heroic frame improves
With heavenly bloom and like a god he moves
A fragrance breathes around majestic grace
Attends his steps the astonished virgins gaze
Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas
Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze

The wondering nymph his glorious port surveyd
And to her damsels with amazement said

Not without care divine the stranger treads
This land of joy his steps some godhead leads
Would Jove destroy him sure he had been driven
Far from this realm the favourite isle of heaven
Late a sad spectacle of woe he trod
The desert sands and now be looks a god
Oh heaven in my connubial hour decree
This man my spouse or such a spouse as he
But haste the viands and the bowl provide
The maids the viands and the bowl supplied
Eager he fed for keen his hunger raged
And with the generous vintage thirst assuaged

Now on return her care Nausicaa bends
The robes resumes the glittering car ascends
Far blooming oer the field and as she pressd
The splendid seat the listening chief addressd

Stranger arise the sun rolls down the day
Lo to the palace I direct thy way
Where in high state the nobles of the land
Attend my royal sire a radiant band
But hear though wisdom in thy soul presides
Speaks from thy tongue and every action guides
Advance at distance while I pass the plain
Where oer the furrows waves the golden grain
Alone I reascendWith airy mounds
A strength of wall the guarded city bounds
The jutting land two ample bays divides
Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides
The spacious basons arching rocks enclose
A sure defence from every storm that blows
Close to the bay great Neptunes fane adjoins
And near a forum flankd with marble shines
Where the bold youth the numerous fleets to store
Shape the broad sail or smooth the taper oar
For not the bow they bend nor boast the skill
To give the featherd arrow wings to kill
But the tall mast above the vessel rear
Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air
They rush into the deep with eager joy
Climb the steep surge and through the tempest fly
A proud unpolishd raceTo me belongs
The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues
Lest malice prone the virtuous to defame
Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name
What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads
Heavens with what graceful majesty he treads
Perhaps a native of some distant shore
The future consort of her bridal hour
Or rather some descendant of the skies
Won by her prayer the aerial bridegroom flies
Heaven on that hour its choicest influence shed
That gave a foreign spouse to crown her bed
All all the godlike worthies that adorn
This realm she flies Phaeacia is her scorn
And just the blame for female innocence
Not only flies the guilt but shuns the offence
The unguarded virgin as unchaste I blame
And the least freedom with the sex is shame
Till our consenting sires a spouse provide
And public nuptials justify the bride
But wouldst thou soon review thy native plain
Attend and speedy thou shalt pass the main
Nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crownd
To Pallas sacred shades the holy ground
We bend our way a bubbling fount distills
A lucid lake and thence descends in rills
Around the grove a mead with lively green
Falls by degrees and forms a beauteous scene
Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours
And there the garden yields a waste of flowers
Hence lies the town as far as to the ear
Floats a strong shout along the waves of air
There wait embowerd while I ascend alone
To great Alcinous on his royal throne
Arrived advance impatient of delay
And to the lofty palace bend thy way
The lofty palace overlooks the town
From every dome by pomp superior known
A child may point the way With earnest gait
Seek thou the queen along the rooms of state
Her royal hand a wondrous work designs
Around a circle of bright damsels shines
Part twist the threads and part the wool dispose
While with the purple orb the spindle glows
High on a throne amid the Scherian powers
My royal father shares the genial hours
But to the queen thy mournful tale disclose
With the prevailing eloquence of woes
So shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore
Though mountains rise between and oceans roar

She added not but waving as she wheeld
The silver scourge it glitterd oer the field
With skill the virgin guides the embroiderd rein
Slow rolls the car before the attending train
Now whirling down the heavens the golden day
Shot through the western clouds a dewy ray
The grove they reach where from the sacred shade
To Pallas thus the pensive hero prayd

Daughter of Jove whose arms in thunder wield
The avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
Forsook by thee in vain I sought thy aid
When booming billows closed above my bead
Attend unconquerd maid accord my vows
Bid the Great hear and pitying heal my woes

This heard Minerva but forbore to fly
By Neptune awed apparent from the sky
Stern god who raged with vengeance unrestraind
Till great Ulysses haild his native land



BOOK VII

ARGUMENT

The court of Alcinous

The princess Nausicaa returns to the city and Ulysses soon after
follows thither He is met by Pallas in the form of a young
virgin who guides him to the palace and directs him in what
manner to address the queen Arete She then involves him in a mist
which causes him to pass invisible The palace and gardens of
Alcinous described Ulysses falling at the feet of the queen the
mist disperses the Phaecians admire and receive him with
respect The queen inquiring by what means he had the garments he
then wore be relates to her and Alcinous his departure from
Calypso and his arrival in their dominions

The same day continues and the book ends with the night


The patient heavenly man thus suppliant prayd
While the slow mules draws on the imperial maid
Through the proud street she moves the public gaze
The turning wheel before the palace stays
With ready love her brothers gathering round
Received the vestures and the mules unbound
She seeks the bridal bower a matron there
The rising fire supplies with busy care
Whose charms in youth her fathers heart inflamed
Now worn with age Eurymedusa named
The captive dame Phaeacian rovers bore
Snatchd from Epirus her sweet native shore
A grateful prize and in her bloom bestowd
On good Alcinous honord as a god
Nurse of Nausicaa from her infant years
And tender second to a mothers cares

Now from the sacred thicket where he lay
To town Ulysses took the winding way
Propitious Pallas to secure her care
Around him spread a veil of thickend air
To shun the encounter of the vulgar crowd
Insulting still inquisitive and loud
When near the famed Phaeacian walls he drew
The beauteous city opening to his view
His step a virgin met and stood before
A polishd urn the seeming virgin bore
And youthful smiled but in the low disguise
Lay hid the goddess with the azure eyes

Show me fair daughter thus the chief demands
The house of him who rules these happy lands
Through many woes and wanderings do I come
To good Alcinous hospitable dome
Far from my native coast I rove alone
A wretched stranger and of all unknown

The goddess answerd Father I obey
And point the wandering traveller his way
Well known to me the palace you inquire
For fast beside it dwells my honourd sire
But silent march nor greet the common train
With question needless or inquiry vain
A race of ragged mariners are these
Unpolishd men and boisterous as their seas
The native islanders alone their care
And hateful he who breathes a foreign air
These did the ruler of the deep ordain
To build proud navies and command the main
On canvas wings to cut the watery way
No bird so light no thought so swift as they

Thus having spoke the unknown celestial leads
The footsteps of the duty he treads
And secret moves along the crowded space
Unseen of all the rude Phaeacian race
So Pallas orderd Pallas to their eyes
The mist objected and condensed the skies
The chief with wonder sees the extended streets
The spreading harbours and the riding fleets
He next their princes lofty domes admires
In separate islands crownd with rising spires
And deep entrenchments and high walls of stone
That gird the city like a marble zone
At length the kingly palacegates he viewd
There stoppd the goddess and her speech renewd

My task is done the mansion you inquire
Appears before you enter and admire
Highthroned and feasting there thou shalt behold
The sceptred rulers Fear not but be bold
A decent boldness ever meets with friends
Succeeds and even a stranger recommends
First to the queen prefer a suppliants claim
Alcinous queen Arete is her name
The same her parents and her power the same
For know from oceans god Nausithous sprung
And Peribaea beautiful and young
Eurymedons last hope who ruled of old
The race of giants impious proud and bold
Perishd the nation in unrighteous war
Perishd the prince and left this only heir
Who now by Neptunes amorous power compressd
Produced a monarch that his people blessd
Father and prince of the Phaeacian name
From him Rhexenor and Alcinous came
The first by Phoebus hurtling arrows fired
New from his nuptials hapless youth expired
No son survived Arete heird his state
And her Alcinous chose his royal mate
With honours yet to womankind unknown
This queen he graces and divides the throne
In equal tenderness her sons conspire
And all the children emulate their sire
When through the streets she gracious deigns to move
The public wonder and the public love
The tongues of all with transport sound her praise
The eyes of all as on a goddess gaze
She feels the triumph of a generous breast
To heal divisions to relieve the oppressd
In virtue rich in blessing others blessd
to then secure thy humble suit prefer
And owe thy country and thy friends to her

With that the goddess deignd no longer stay
But oer the world of waters wingd her way
Forsaking Scherias everpleasing shore
The winds to Marathon the virgin bore
Thence where proud Athens rears her towery head
With opening streets and shining structures spread
She passd delighted with the wellknown seats
And to Erectheus sacred dome retreats

Meanwhile Ulysses at the palace waits
There stops and anxious with his soul debates
Fixd in amaze before the royal gates
The front appeard with radiant splendours gay
Bright as the lamp of night or orb of day
The walls were massy brass the cornice high
Blue metals crownd in colours of the sky
Rich plates of gold the folding doors incase
The pillars silver on a brazen base
Silver the lintels deepprojecting oer
And gold the ringlets that command the door
Two rows of stately dogs on either hand
In sculptured gold and labourd silver stood
These Vulcan formd with art divine to wait
Immortal guardians at Alcinous gate
Alive each animated frame appears
And still to live beyond the power of years
Fair thrones within from space to space were raised
Where various carpets with embroidery blessed
The work of matrons these the princes pressd
Day following day a longcontinued feast
Refulgent pedestals the walls surround
Which boys of gold with illuming torches crownd
The polishd oar reflecting every ray
Blazed on the banquets with a double day
Full fifty handmaids form the household train
Some turn the mill or sift the golden grain
Some ply the loom their busy fingers move
Like poplarleaves when Zephyr fans the grove
Not more renownd the men of Scherias isle
For sailing arts and all the naval toil
Than works of female skill their womens pride
The flying shuttle through the threads to guide
Pallas to these her double gifts imparts
Incentive genius and industrious arts

Close to the gates a spacious garden lies
From storms defended and inclement skies
Four acres was the allotted space of ground
Fenced with a green enclosure all around
Tall thriving trees confessd the fruitful mould
The reddening apple ripens here to gold
Here the blue fig with luscious juice oerflows
With deeper red the full pomegranate glows
The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear
And verdant olives flourish round the year
The balmy spirit of the western gale
Eternal breathes on fruits unthought to fail
Each dropping pear a following pear supplies
On apples apples figs on figs arise
The same mild season gives the blooms to blow
The buds to harden and the fruits to grow

Here orderd vines in equal ranks appear
With all the united labours of the year
Some to unload the fertile branches run
Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun
Others to tread the liquid harvest join
The groaning presses foam with floods of wine
Here are the vines in early flower descried
Here grapes discolourd on the sunnyside
And there in autumns richest purple dyed

Beds of all various herbs for ever green
In beauteous order terminate the scene

Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crownd
This through the gardens leads its streams around
Visits each plant and waters all the ground
While that in pipes beneath the palace flows
And thence its current on the town bestows
To various use their various streams they bring
The people one and one supplies the king

Such were the glories which the gods ordaind
To grace Alcinous and his happy land
Een from the chief whom men and nations knew
The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew
In pleasing thought he ran the prospect oer
Then hasty enterd at the lofty door
Night now approaching in the palace stand
With goblets crownd the rulers of the land
Prepared for rest and offering to the god
Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod
Unseen he glided through the joyous crowd
With darkness circled and an ambient cloud
Direct to great Alcinous throne he came
And prostrate fell before the imperial dame
Then from around him droppd the veil of night
Sudden he shines and manifest to sight
The nobles gaze with awful fear oppressd
Silent they gaze and eye the godlike guest

Daughter of great Rhexenor thus began
Low at her knees the muchenduring man
To thee thy consort and this royal train
To all that share the blessings of your reign
A suppliant bends oh pity human woe
Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe
A wretched exile to his country send
Long worn with griefs and long without a friend
So may the gods your better days increase
And all your joys descend on all your race
So reign for ever on your countrys breast
Your people blessing by your people blessd

Then to the genial hearth he bowd his face
And humbled in the ashes took his place
Silence ensued The eldest first began
Echeneus sage a venerable man
Whose welltaught mind the present age surpassd
And joind to that the experience of the last
Fit words attended on his weighty sense
And mild persuasion flowd in eloquence

Oh sight he cried dishonest and unjust
A guest a stranger seated in the dust
To raise the lowly suppliant from the ground
Befits a monarch Lo the peers around
But wait thy word the gentle guest to grace
And seat him fair in some distinguishd place
Let first the herald due libation pay
To Jove who guides the wanderer on his way
Then set the genial banquet in his view
And give the strangerguest a strangers due

His sage advice the listening king obeys
He stretchd his hand the prudent chief to raise
And from his seat Laodamas removed
The monarchs offspring and his bestbeloved
There next his side the godlike hero sate
With stars of silver shone the bed of state
The golden ewer a beauteous handmaid brings
Replenishd from the cool translucent springs
Whose polishd vase with copious streams supplies
A silver layer of capacious size
The table next in regal order spread
The glittering canisters are heapd with bread
Viands of various kinds invite the taste
Of choicest sort and savour rich repast
Thus feasting high Alcinous gave the sign
And bade the herald pour the rosy wine
Let all around the due libation pay
To Jove who guides the wanderer on his way

He said Pontonous heard the kings command
The circling goblet moves from hand to hand
Each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man
Alcinous then with aspect mild began

Princes and peers attend while we impart
To you the thoughts of no inhuman heart
Now pleased and satiate from the social rite
Repair we to the blessings of the night
But with the rising day assembled here
Let all the elders of the land appear
Pious observe our hospitable laws
And Heaven propitiate in the strangers cause
Then joind in council proper means explore
Safe to transport him to the wishedfor shore
How distant that imports us not to know
Nor weigh the labour but relieve the woe
Meantime nor harm nor anguish let him bear
This interval Heaven trusts him to our care
But to his native land our charge resignd
Heavens is his life to come and all the woes behind
Then must he suffer what the Fates ordain
For Fate has wove the thread of life with pain
And twins een from the birth are Misery and Man
But if descended from the Olympian bower
Gracious approach us some immortal power
If in that form thou comest a guest divine
Some high event the conscious gods design
As yet unbid they never graced our feast
The solemn sacrifice calld down the guest
Then manifest of Heaven the vision stood
And to our eyes familiar was the god
Oft with some favourd traveller they stray
And shine before him all the desert way
With social intercourse and face to face
The friends and guardians of our pious race
So near approach we their celestial kind
By justice truth and probity of mind
As our dire neighbours of Cyclopean birth
Match in fierce wrong the giantsons of earth

Let no such thought with modest grace rejoind
The prudent Greek possess the royal mind
Alas a mortal like thyself am I
No glorious native of yon azure sky
In form ah how unlike their heavenly kind
How more inferior in the gifts of mind
Alas a mortal most oppressd of those
Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes
By a sad train of Miseries alone
Distinguishd long and second now to none
By Heavens high will compelld from shore to shore
With Heavens high will prepared to suffer more
What histories of toil could I declare
But still longwearied nature wants repair
Spent with fatigue and shrunk with pining fast
My craving bowels still require repast
Howeer the noble suffering mind may grieve
Its load of anguish and disdain to live
Necessity demands our daily bread
Hunger is insolent and will be fed
But finish oh ye peers what you propose
And let the morrows dawn conclude my woes
Pleased will I suffer all the gods ordain
To see my soil my son my friends again
That view vouchsafed let instant death surprise
With everduring shade these happy eyes

The assembled peers with general praise approved
His pleaded reason and the suit he moved
Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares
And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs
Ulysses in the regal walls alone
Remaind beside him on a splendid throne
Divine Arete and Alcinous shone
The queen an nearer view the guest surveyd
Robd in the garments her own hands had made
Not without wonder seen Then thus began
Her words addressing to the godlike man

Camest thou hither wondrous stranger I say
From lands remote and oer a length of sea
Tell then whence art thou whence that princely air
And robes like these so recent and so fair

Hard is the task O princess you impose
Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes
The long the mournful series to relate
Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate
Yet what you ask attend An island lies
Beyond these tracts and under other skies
Ogygia named in Oceans watery arms
Where dwells Calypso dreadful in her charms
Remote from gods or men she holds her reign
Amid the terrors of a rolling main
Me only me the hand of fortune bore
Unblest to tread that interdicted shore
When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps
Launchd his red lightning at our scattered ships
Then all my fleet and all my followers lost
Sole on a plank on boiling surges tossd
Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find
Full nine days floating to the wave and wind
Met by the goddess there with open arms
She bribed my stay with more than human charms
Nay promised vainly promised to bestow
Immortal life exempt from age and woe
But all her blandishments successless prove
To banish from my breast my countrys love
I stay reluctant seven continued years
And water her ambrosial couch with tears
The eighth she voluntary moves to part
Or urged by Jove or her own changeful heart
A raft was formed to cross the surging sea
Herself supplied the stores and rich array
And gave the gales to waft me on my way
In seventeen days appeard your pleasing coast
And woody mountains half in vapours lost
Joy touched my soul my soul was joyd in vain
For angry Neptune roused the raging main
The wild winds whistle and the billows roar
The splitting raft the furious tempest tore
And storms vindictive intercept the shore
Soon as their rage subsides the seas I brave
With naked force and shoot along the wave
To reach this isle but there my hopes were lost
The surge impelld me on a craggy coast
I chose the safer sea and chanced to find
A rivers mouth impervious to the wind
And clear of rocks I fainted by the flood
Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood
Twas night and covered in the foliage deep
Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep
All night I slept oblivious of my pain
Aurora dawned and Phoebus shined in vain
Nor till oblique he sloped his evening ray
Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away
Then female voices from the shore I heard
A maid amidst them goddesslike appeard
To her I sued she pitied my distress
Like thee in beauty nor in virtue less
Who from such youth could hope considerate care
In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare
She gave me life relieved with just supplies
My wants and lent these robes that strike your eyes
This is the truth and oh ye powers on high
Forbid that want should sink me to a lie

To this the king Our daughter but expressd
Her cares imperfect to our godlike guest
Suppliant to her since first he chose to pray
Why not herself did she conduct the way
And with her handmaids to our court convey

Hero and king Ulysses thus replied
Nor blame her faultless nor suspect of pride
She bade me follow in the attendant train
But fear and reverence did my steps detain
Lest rash suspicion might alarm thy mind
Mans of a jealous and mistaken kind

Far from my soul he cried the gods efface
All wrath illgrounded and suspicion base
Whateer is honest stranger I approve
And would to Phoebus Pallas and to Jove
Such as thou art thy thought and mine were one
Nor thou unwilling to be called my son
In such alliance couldst thou wish to join
A palace stored with treasures should be thine
But if reluctant who shall force thy stay
Jove bids to set the stranger on his way
And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray
Till then let slumber cross thy careful eyes
The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies
And seize the moment when the breezes rise
Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore
Where thy soul rests and labour is no more
Far as Euboea though thy country lay
Our ships with ease transport thee in a day
Thither of old earths giant son to view
On wings of wind with Rhadamanth they flew
This land from whence their morning course begun
Saw them returning with the setting sun
Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale
Our youth how dexterous and how fleet our sail
When justly timed with equal sweep they row
And ocean whitens in long tracks below

Thus he No word the experienced man replies
But thus to heaven and heavenward lifts his eyes
O Jove O father what the king accords
Do thou make perfect sacred be his words
Wide oer the world Alcinous glory shine
Let fame be his and ah my country mine

Meantime Arete for the hour of rest
Ordains the fleecy couch and covering vest
Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare
And the thick carpets spread with busy care
With torches blazing in their hands they passd
And finishd all their queens command with haste
Then gave the signal to the willing guest
He rose with pleasure and retired to rest
There soft extended to the murmuring sound
Of the high porch Ulysses sleeps profound
Within released from cares Alcinous lies
And fast beside were closed Aretes eyes



BOOK VIII

ARGUMENT

Alcinous calls a council in which it is resolved to transport
Ulysses into his country After which splendid entertainments are
made where the celebrated musician and poet Demodocus plays and
sings to the guests They next proceed to the games the race the
wrestling discus c where Ulysses casts a prodigious length
to the admiration of all the spectators They return again to the
banquet and Demodocus sings the loves of Mars and Venus Ulysses
after a compliment to the poet desires him to sing the
introduction of the wooden horse into Troy which subject
provoking his tears Alcinous inquires of his guest his name
parentage and fortunes



Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray
And all the ruddy orient flames with day
Alcinous and the chief with dawning light
Rose instant from the slumbers of the night
Then to the councilseat they bend their way
And fill the shining thrones along the bay

Meanwhile Minerva in her guardian care
Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air
In form a herald of the king she flies
From peer to peer and thus incessant cries

Nobles and chiefs who rule Phaeacias states
The king in council your attendance waits
A prince of grace divine your aid implores
Oer unknown seas arrived from unknown shores

She spoke and sudden with tumultuous sounds
Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds
At once the seats they fill and every eye
Glazed as before some brother of the sky
Pallas with grace divine his form improves
More high he treads and more enlarged he moves
She sheds celestial bloom regard to draw
And gives a dignity of mien to awe
With strength the future prize of fame to play
And gather all the honours of the day

Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose
Attend he cried while we our will disclose
Your present aid this godlike stranger craves
Tossd by rude tempest through a war of waves
Perhaps from realms that view the rising day
Or nations subject to the western ray
Then grant what here all sons of wine obtain
For here affliction never pleads in vain
Be chosen youth prepared expert to try
The vast profound and hid the vessel fly
Launch the tall back and order every oar
Then in our court indulge the genial hour
Instant you sailors to this task attend
Swift to the palace all ye peers ascend
Let none to strangers honours due disclaim
Be there Demodocus the bard of fame
Taught by the gods to please when high he sings
The vocal lay responsive to the strings

Thus spoke the prince the attending peers obey
In state they move Alcinous heads the way
Swift to Demodocus the herald flies
At once the sailors to their charge arise
They launch the vessel and unfurl the sails
And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales
Then to the palace move a gathering throng
Youth and white age tumultuous pour along
Now all accesses to the dome are filld
Eight boars the choicest of the herd are killd
Two beeves twelve fatlings from the flock they bring
To crown the feast so wills the bounteous king
The herald now arrives and guides along
The sacred master of celestial song
Dear to the Muse who gave his days to flow
With mighty blessings mixd with mighty woe
With clouds of darkness quenchd his visual ray
But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay
High on a radiant throne sublime in state
Encircled by huge multitudes he sate
With silver shone the throne his lyre well strung
To rapturous sounds at hand Poutonous hung
Before his seat a polishd table shines
And a full goblet foams with generous wines
His food a herald bore and now they fed
And now the rage of craving hunger fled

Then fired by all the Muse aloud he sings
The mighty deeds of demigods and kings
From that fierce wrath the noble song arose
That made Ulysses and Achilles foes
How oer the feast they doom the fall of Troy
The stern debate Atrides hears with joy
For Heaven foretold the contest when he trod
The marble threshold of the Delphic god
Curious to learn the counsels of the sky
Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy

Touchd at the song Ulysses straight resignd
To soft affliction all his manly mind
Before his eyes the purple vest he drew
Industrious to conceal the falling dew
But when the music paused he ceased to shed
The flowing tear and raised his drooping head
And lifting to the gods a goblet crownd
He pourd a pure libation to the ground

Transported with the song the listening train
Again with loud applause demand the strain
Again Ulysses veild his pensive head
Again unmannd a shower of sorrows shed
Conceald he wept the king observed alone
The silent tear and heard the secret groan
Then to the bard aloudO cease to sing
Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string
Enough the feast has pleased enough the power
Of heavenly song has crownd the genial hour
Incessant in the games your strength display
Contest ye brave the honours of the day
That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim
In distant regions the Phaeacian fame
None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway
Or swifter in the race devour the way
None in the leap spring with so strong a bound
Or firmer in the wrestling press the ground

Thus spoke the king the attending peers obey
In state they move Alcinous lends the way
His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung
High on a column in the palace hung
And guided by a heralds guardian cares
Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs

Now swarms the populace a countless throng
Youth and boar age and man drives man along
The games begin ambitious of the prize
Acroneus Thoon and Eretmeus rise
The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim
Anchialus and Ponteus chiefs of fame
There Proreus Nautes Eratreus appear
And famed Amphialus Polyneus heir
Euryalus like Mars terrific rose
When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes
Naubolides with grace unequalld shone
Or equalld by Laodamas alone
With these came forth Ambasineus the strong
And three brave sons from great Alcinous sprung

Ranged in a line the ready racers stand
Start from the goal and vanish oer the strand
Swift as on wings of winds upborne they fly
And drifts of rising dust involve the sky
Before the rest what space the hinds allow
Between the mule and ox from plough to plough
Clytonius sprung he wingd the rapid way
And bore the unrivalld honours of the day
With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join
The conquest great Euryalus is thine
Amphialus sprung forward with a bound
Superior in the leap a length of ground
From Elatreus strong arm the discus flies
And sings with unmatchd force along the skies
And Laodam whirls high with dreadful sway
The gloves of death victorious in the fray

While thus the peerage in the games contends
In act to speak Laodamas ascends

O friends he cries the stranger seems well skilld
To try the illustrious labours of the field
I deem him brave then grant the brave mans claim
Invite the hero to his share of fame
What nervous arms he boasts how firm his tread
His limbs how turnd how broad his shoulders spread
By age unbrokebut allconsuming care
Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare
Dire is the ocean dread in all its forms
Man must decay when man contends with storms

Well hast thou spoke Euryalus replies
Thine is the guest invite him thou to rise
Swift as the word advancing from the crowd
He made obeisance and thus spoke aloud

Vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display
His manly worth and share the glorious day
Father arise for thee thy port proclaims
Expert to conquer in the solemn games
To fame arise for what more fame can yield
Than the swift race or conflict of the field
Steal from corroding care one transient day
To glory give the space thou hast to stay
Short is the time and lo een now the gales
Call thee aboard and stretch the swelling sails

To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply
Ah why the illsuiting pastime must I try
To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free
Ill the gay sorts with troubled hearts agree
Sad from my natal hour my days have ran
A muchafflicted muchenduring man
Who suppliant to the king and peers implores
A speedy voyage to his native shore
Wise wanders Laodam thy erring tongue
The sports of glory to the brave belong
Retorts Euryalus he bears no claim
Among the great unlike the sons of Fame
A wandering merchant he frequents the main
Some mean seafarer in pursuit of gain
Studious of freight in naval trade well skilld
But dreads the athletic labours of the field
Incensed Ulysses with a frown replies
O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise
With partial hands the gods their gifts dispense
Some greatly think some speak with manly sense
Here Heaven an elegance of form denies
But wisdom the defect of form supplies
This man with energy of thought controls
And steals with modest violence our souls
He speaks reservedly but he speaks with force
Nor can one word be changed but for a worse
In public more than mortal he appears
And as he moves the praising crowd reveres
While others beauteous as the etherial kind
The nobler portion went a knowing mind
In outward show Heaven gives thee to excel
But Heaven denies the praise of thinking well
Ill bear the brave a rude ungovernd tongue
And youth my generous soul resents the wrong
Skilld in heroic exercise I claim
A post of honour with the sons of Fame
Such was my boast while vigour crownd my days
Now care surrounds me and my force decays
Inured a melancholy part to bear
In scenes of death by tempest and by war
Yet thus by woes impaird no more I waive
To prove the heroslander stings the brave

Then gliding forward with a furious bound
He wrenchd a rocky fragment from the ground
By far more ponderous and more huge by far
Than what Phaeacias sons discharged in air
Fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings
Sonorous through the shaded air it sings
Couchd to the earth tempestuous as it flies
The crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies
Beyond all marks with many a giddy round
Downrushing it upturns a hill of ground

That Instant Pallas bursting from a cloud
Fixd a distinguishd mark and cried aloud

Een he who sightless wants his visual ray
May by his touch alone award the day
Thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound
Of every champion by a length of ground
Securely bid the strongest of the train
Arise to throw the strongest throws in vain

She spoke and momentary mounts the sky
The friendly voice Ulysses hears with joy
Then thus aloud elate with decent pride
Rise ye Phaecians try your force he cried
If with this throw the strongest caster vie
Still further still I bid the discus fly
Stand forth ye champions who the gauntlet wield
Or ye the swiftest racers of the field
Stand forth ye wrestlers who these pastimes grace
I wield the gauntlet and I run the race
In such heroic games I yield to none
Or yield to brave Laodamas alone
Shall I with brave Laodamas contend
A friend is sacred and I style him friend
Ungenerous were the man and base of heart
Who takes the kind and pays the ungrateful part
Chiefly the man in foreign realms confined
Base to his friend to his own interest blind
All all your heroes I this day defy
Give me a man that we our might may try
Expert in every art I boast the skill
To give the featherd arrow wings to kill
Should a whole host at once discharge the bow
My wellaimd shaft with death prevents the foe
Alone superior in the field of Troy
Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly
From all the sons of earth unrivalld praise
I justly claim but yield to better days
To those famed days when great Alcides rose
And Eurytus who bade the gods be foes
Vain Eurytus whose art became his crime
Swept from the earth he perishd in his prime
Sudden the irremeable way he trod
Who boldly durst defy the bowyer god
In fighting fields as far the spear I throw
As flies an arrow from the welldrawn bow
Sole in the race the contest I decline
Stiff are my weary joints and I resign
By storms and hunger worn age well may fail
When storms and hunger doth at once assail

Abashd the numbers hear the godlike man
Till great Alcinous mildly thus began

Well hast thou spoke and well thy generous tongue
With decent pride refutes a public wrong
Warm are thy words but warm without offence
Fear only fools secure in men of sense
Thy worth is known Then hear our countrys claim
And bear to heroes our heroic fame
In distant realms our glorious deeds display
Repeat them frequent in the genial day
When blest with ease thy woes and wanderings end
Teach them thy consort bid thy sons attend
How loved of Jove he crownd our sires with praise
How we their offspring dignify our race

Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield
Or boast the glories of the athletic field
We in the course unrivalld speed display
Or through cerulean billows plough the way
To dress to dance to sing our sole delight
The feast or bath by day and love by night
Rise then ye skilld in measures let him bear
Your fame to men that breathe a distant air
And faithful say to you the powers belong
To race to sail to dance to chant the song

But herald to the palace swift repair
And the soft lyre to grace our pastimes bear

Swift at the word obedient to the king
The herald flies the tuneful lyre to bring
Up rose nine seniors chosen to survey
The future games the judges of the day
With instant care they mark a spacious round
And level for the dance the allotted ground
The herald bears the lyre intent to play
The bard advancing meditates the lay
Skilld in the dance tall youths a blooming band
Graceful before the heavenly minstrel stand
Light bounding from the earth at once they rise
Their feet halfviewless quiver in the skies
Ulysses gazed astonishd to survey
The glancing splendours as their sandals play
Meantime the bard alternate to the strings
The loves of Mars and Cytherea sings
How the stern god enamourd with her charms
Claspd the gay panting goddess in his arms
By bribes seduced and how the sun whose eye
Views the broad heavens disclosed the lawless joy
Stung to the soul indignant through the skies
To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies
Arrived his sinewy arms incessant place
The eternal anvil on the massy base
A wondrous net he labours to betray
The wanton lovers as entwined they lay
Indissolubly strong Then instant bears
To his immortal dome the finishd snares
Above below around with art dispread
The sure inclosure folds the genial bed
Whose texture even the search of gods deceives
Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves
Then as withdrawing from the starry bowers
He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores
His favourite isle observant Mars descries
His wishd recees and to the goddess flies
He glows he burns the fairhaird queen of love
Descends smooth gliding from the courts of Jove
Gay blooming in full charms her hand he pressd
With eager joy and with a sigh addressd

Come my beloved and taste the soft delights
Come to repose the genial bed invites
Thy absent spouse neglectful of thy charms
Prefers his barbarous Sintians to thy arms

Then nothing loth the enamourd fair he led
And sunk transported on the conscious bed
Down rushd the toils inwrapping as they lay
The careless lovers in their wanton play
In vain they strive the entangling snares deny
Inextricably firm the power to fly
Warnd by the god who sheds the golden day
Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way
Arrived he sees he grieves with rage he burns
Full horribly he roars his voice all heaven returns

O Jove he cried O all ye powers above
See the lewd dalliance of the queen of love
Me awkward me she scorns and yields her charms
To that fair lecher the strong god of arms
If I am lame that stain my natal hour
By fate imposed such me my parent bore
Why was I born See how the wanton lies
Oh sight tormenting to a husbands eyes
But yet I trust this once een Mars would fly
His fairones armshe thinks her once too nigh
But there remain ye guilty in my power
Till Jove refunds his shameless daughters dower
Too dear I prized a fair enchanting face
Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace

Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng
Apollo comes and Neptune comes along
With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain
But modesty withheld the goddess train
All heaven beholds imprisond as they lie
And unextinguishd laughter shakes the sky
Then mutual thus they spoke Behold on wrong
Swift vengeance waits and art subdues the strong
Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow
More swift than Mars and more than Vulcan slow
Yet Vulcan conquers and the god of arms
Must pay the penalty for lawless charms

Thus serious they but he who gilds the skies
The gay Apollo thus to Hermes cries
Wouldst thou enchaind like Mars O Hermes lie
And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy

O envied shame the smiling youth rejoind
And thrice the chains and thrice more firmly bind
Gaze all ye gods and every goddess gaze
Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace

Loud laugh the rest een Neptune laughs aloud
Yet sues importunate to loose the god
And free he cries O Vulcan free from shame
Thy captives I ensure the penal claim

Will Neptune Vulcan then the faithless trust
He suffers who gives surety for the unjust
But say if that lewd scandal of the sky
To liberty restored perfidious fly
Say wilt thou bear the mulct He instant cries
The mulct I bear if Mars perfidious flies

To whom appeased No more I urge delay
When Neptune sues my part is to obey
Then to the snares his force the god applies
They burst and Mars to Thrace indignant flies
To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves
To visit Paphos and her blooming groves
Where to the Power an hundred altars rise
And breathing odours scent the balmy skies
Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers
The Graces unguents shed ambrosial showers
Unguents that charm the gods she last assumes
Her wondrous robes and full the goddess blooms

Thus sung the bard Ulysses hears with joy
And loud applauses read the vaulted sky

Then to the sports his sons the king commands
Each blooming youth before the monarch stands
In dance unmatchd A wondrous ball is brought
The work of Polypus divinely wrought
This youth with strength enormous bids it fly
And bending backward whirls it to the sky
His brother springing with an active bound
At distance intercepts it from the ground
The ball dismissed in dance they skim the strand
Turn and return and scarce imprint the sand
The assembly gazes with astonished eyes
And sends in shouts applauses to the skies

Then thus Ulysses Happy king whose name
The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame
In subjects happy with surprise I gaze
Thy praise was just their skill transcends thy praise

Pleasd with his peoples fame the monarch hears
And thus benevolent accosts the peers
Since wisdoms sacred guidance he pursues
Give to the strangerguest a strangers dues
Twelve princes in our realm dominion share
Oer whom supreme imperial power I bear
Bring gold a pledge of love a talent bring
A vest a robe and imitate your king
Be swift to give that he this night may share
The social feast of joy with joy sincere
And thou Euryalus redeem thy wrong
A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue

The assenting peers obedient to the king
In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring
Then thus Euryalus O prince whose sway
Rules this blessd realm repentant I obey
Be his this sword whose blade of brass displays
A ruddy gleam whose hilt a silver blaze
Whose ivory sheath inwrought with curious pride
Adds graceful terror to the wearers side

He said and to his hand the sword consignd
And if he cried my words affect thy mind
Far from thy mind those words ye whirlwinds bear
And scatter them ye storms in empty air
Crown O ye heavens with joy his peaceful hours
And grant him to his spouse and native shores

And blest be thou my friend Ulysses cries
Crown him with every joy ye favouring skies
To thy calm hours continued peace afford
And never never mayst thou want this sword

He said and oer his shoulder flung the blade
Now oer the earth ascends the evening shade
The precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear
And to the court the embodied peers repair
Before the queen Alcinous sons unfold
The vests the robes and heaps of shining gold
Then to the radiant thrones they move in state
Aloft the king in pomp imperial sate

Thence to the queen O partner of our reign
O sole beloved command thy menial train
A polishd chest and stately robes to bear
And healing waters for the bath prepare
That bathed our guest may bid his sorrows cease
Hear the sweet song and taste the feast in peace
A bowl that flames with gold of wondrous frame
Ourself we give memorial of our name
To raise in offerings to almighty Jove
And every god that treads the courts above

Instant the queen observant of the king
Commands her train a spacious vase to bring
The spacious vase with ample streams suffice
Heap the high wood and bid the flames arise
The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace
The fuming waters bubble oer the blaze
Herself the chest prepares in order rolld
The robes the vests are ranged and heaps of gold
And adding a rich dress inwrought with art
A gift expressive of her bounteous heart
Thus spoke to Ithacus To guard with bands
Insolvable these gifts thy care demands
Lest in thy slumbers on the watery main
The hand of rapine make our bounty vain

Then bending with full force around he rolld
A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold
Closed with Circaean art A train attends
Around the bath the bath the king ascends
Untasted joy since that disastrous hour
He saild illfated from Calypsos bower
Where happy as the gods that range the sky
He feasted every sense with every joy
He bathes the damsels with officious toil
Shed sweets shed unguents in a shower of oil
Then oer his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads
And to the feast magnificently treads
Full where the dome its shining valves expands
Nausicaa blooming as a goddess stands
With wondering eyes the hero she surveyd
And graceful thus began the royal maid

Hail godlike stranger and when heaven restores
To thy fond wish thy longexpected shores
This ever grateful in remembrance bear
To me thou owest to me the vital air

O royal maid Ulysses straight returns
Whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns
So may dread Jove whose arm in vengeance forms
The writhen bolt and blackens heaven with storms
Restore me safe through weary wanderings tossd
To my dear countrys everpleasing coast
As while the spirit in this bosom glows
To thee my goddess I address my vows
My life thy gift I boast He said and sate
Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state

Now each partakes the feast the wine prepares
Portions the food and each his portion shares
The bard a herald guides the gazing throng
Pay low obeisance as he moves along
Beneath a sculpturd arch he sits enthroned
The peers encircling form an awful round
Then from the chine Ulysses carves with art
Delicious food an honorary part
This let the master of the lyre receive
A pledge of love tis all a wretch can give
Lives there a man beneath the spacious skies
Who sacred honours to the bard denies
The Muse the bard inspires exalts his mind
The muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind

The herald to his hand the charge conveys
Not fond of flattery nor unpleased with praise

When now the rage of hunger was allayd
Thus to the lyrist wise Ulysses said
O more than man thy soul the muse inspires
Or Phoebus animates with all his fires
For who by Phoebus uninformd could know
The woe of Greece and sing so well the woe
Just to the tale as present at the fray
Or taught the labours of the dreadful day
The song recalls past horrors to my eyes
And bids proud Ilion from her ashes rise
Once more harmonious strike the sounding string
The Epaean fabric framed by Pallas sing
How stern Ulysses furious to destroy
With latent heroes sackd imperial Troy
If faithful thou record the tale of Fame
The god himself inspires thy breast with flame
And mine shall be the task henceforth to raise
In every land thy monument of praise

Full of the god he raised his lofty strain
How the Greeks rushd tumultuous to the main
How blazing tents illumined half the skies
While from the shores the winged navy flies
How een in Ilions walls in deathful bands
Came the stern Greeks by Troys assisting hands
All Troy upheaved the steed of differing mind
Various the Trojans counselld part consignd
The monster to the sword part sentence gave
To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave
The unwise award to lodge it in the towers
An offering sacred to the immortal powers
The unwise prevail they lodge it in the walls
And by the gods decree proud Ilion falls
Destruction enters in the treacherous wood
And vengeful slaughter fierce for human blood

He sung the Greeks sternissuing from the steed
How Ilion burns how all her fathers bleed
How to thy dome Deiphobus ascends
The Spartan king how Ithacus attends
Horrid as Mars and how with dire alarms
He fightssubdues for Pallas strings his arms

Thus while he sung Ulysses griefs renew
Tears bathe his cheeks and tears the ground bedew
As some fond matron views in mortal fight
Her husband falling in his countrys right
Frantic through clashing swords she runs she flies
As ghastly pale he groans and faints and dies
Close to his breast she grovels on the ground
And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound
She cries she shrieks the fierce insulting foe
Relentless mocks her violence of woe
To chains condemnd as wildly she deplores
A widow and a slave on foreign shores

So from the sluices of Ulysses eyes
Fast fell the tears and sighs succeeded sighs
Conceald he grieved the king observed alone
The silent tear and heard the secret groan
Then to the bard aloud O cease to sing
Dumb be thy voice and mute the tuneful string
To every note his tears responsive flow
And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe
Thy lay too deeply moves then cease the lay
And oer the banquet every heart be gay
This social right demands for him the sails
Floating in air invite the impelling gales
His are the gifts of love the wise and good
Receive the stranger as a brothers blood

But friend discover faithful what I crave
Artful concealment ill becomes the brave
Say what thy birth and what the name you bore
Imposed by parents in the natal hour
For from the natal hour distinctive names
One common right the great and lowly claims
Say from what city from what regions tossd
And what inhabitants those regions boast
So shalt thou instant reach the realm assignd
In wondrous ships selfmoved instinct with mind
No helm secures their course no pilot guides
Like man intelligent they plough the tides
Conscious of every coast and every bay
That lies beneath the suns allseeing ray
Though clouds and darkness veil the encumberd sky
Fearless through darkness and through clouds they fly
Though tempests rage though rolls the swelling main
The seas may roll the tempests rage in vain
Een the stern god that oer the waves presides
Safe as they pass and safe repass the tides
With fury burns while careless they convey
Promiscuous every guest to every bay
These ears have heard my royal sire disclose
A dreadful story big with future woes
How Neptune raged and how by his command
Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand
A monument of wrath how mound on mound
Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground
But this the gods may frustrate or fulfil
As suits the purpose of the Eternal Will
But say through what waste regions hast thou strayd
What customs noted and what coasts surveyd
Possessd by wild barbarians fierce in arms
Or men whose bosom tender pity warms
Say why the fate of Troy awaked thy cares
Why heaved thy bosom and why flowed thy tears
Just are the ways of Heaven from Heaven proceed
The woes of man Heaven doomd the Greeks to bleed
A theme of future song Say then if slain
Some dearloved brother pressd the Phrygian plain
Or bled some friend who bore a brothers part
And claimd by merit not by blood the heart



BOOK IX

THE ADVENTURES OF THE CICONS LOTOPHAGI AND CYCLOPS

Ulysses begins the relation of his adventures how after the
destruction of Troy he with his companions made an incursion on
the Cicons by whom they were repulsed and meeting with a storm
were driven to the coast of the Lotophagi From there they sailed
to the land of the Cyclops whose manners and situation are
particularly characterised The giant Polyphemus and his cave
described the usage Ulysses and his companions met with there
and lastly the method and artifice by which he escaped



Then thus Ulysses Thou whom first in sway
As first in virtue these thy realms obey
How sweet the products of a peaceful reign
The heaventaught poet and enchanting strain
The wellfilled palace the perpetual feast
A land rejoicing and a people blessd
How goodly seems it ever to employ
Mans social days in union and in joy
The plenteous hoard highheapd with cates divine
And oer the foaming bowl the laughing wine

Amid these joys why seels thy mind to know
The unhappy series of a wanderers woe
Rememberance sad whose image to review
Alas I must open all my wounds anew
And oh what first what last shall I relate
Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate

Know first the man though now a wretch distressd
Who hopes thee monarch for his future guest
Behold Ulysses no ignoble name
Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame

My native soil is Ithaca the fair
Where high Neritus waves his woods in air
Dulichium Same and Zaccynthus crownd
With shady mountains spread their isles around
These to the north and nights dark regions run
Those to Aurora and the rising sun
Low lies our isle yet blessd in fruitful stores
Strong are her sons though rocky are her shores
And none ah none no lovely to my sight
Of all the lands that heaven oerspreads with light
In vain Calypso long constrained my stay
With sweet reluctant amorous delay
With all her charms as vainly Circe strove
And added magic to secure my love
In pomps or joys the palace or the grot
My countrys image never was forgot
My absent parents rose before my sight
And distant lay contentment and delight

Hear then the woes which mighty Jove ordaind
To wait my passage from the Trojan land
The winds from Ilion to the Cicons shore
Beneath cold Ismarus our vessels bore
We boldly landed on the hostile place
And sackd the city and destroyd the race
Their wives made captive their possessions shared
And every soldier found a like reward
I then advised to fly not so the rest
Who stayd to revel and prolong the feast
The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay
And bowls flow round and riot wastes the day
Meantime the Cicons to their holds retired
Call on the Cicons with new fury fired
With early morn the gatherd country swarms
And all the continent is bright with arms
Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers
Oerspread the land when spring descends in showers
All expert soldiers skilld on foot to dare
Or from the bounding courser urge the war
Now fortune changes so the Fates ordain
Our hour was come to taste our share of pain
Close at the ships the bloody fight began
Wounded they wound and man expires on man
Long as the morning sun increasing bright
Oer heavens pure azure spreads the glowing light
Promiscuous death the form of war confounds
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds
But when his evening wheels oerhung the main
Then conquest crownd the fierce Ciconian train
Six brave companions from each ship we lost
The rest escape in haste and quit the coast
With sails outspread we fly the unequal strife
Sad for their loss but joyful of our life
Yet as we fled our fellows rites we paid
And thrice we calld on each unhappy shade

Meanwhile the god whose hand the thunder forms
Drives clouds on clouds and blackens heaven with storms
Wide oer the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps
And night rushd headlong on the shaded deeps
Now here now there the giddy ships are borne
And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn
We furld the sail we plied the labouring oar
Took down our masts and rowd our ships to shore
Two tedious days and two long nights we lay
Oerwatchd and batterd in the naked bay
But the third morning when Aurora brings
We rear the masts we spread the canvas wings
Refreshd and careless on the deck reclined
We sit and trust the pilot and the wind
Then to my native country had I saild
But the cape doubled adverse winds prevaild
Strong was the tide which by the northern blast
Impelld our vessels on Cythera cast
Nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore
Far in wide ocean and from sight of shore
The tenth we touchd by various errors tossd
The land of Lotus and the flowery coast
We climbd the beach and springs of water found
Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground
Three men were sent deputed from the crew
A herald one the dubious coast to view
And learn what habitants possessd the place
They went and found a hospitable race
Not prone to ill nor strange to foreign guest
They eat they drink and nature gives the feast
The trees around them all their food produce
Lotus the name divine nectareous juice
Thence calld Loophagi which whose tastes
Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts
Nor other home nor other care intends
But quits his house his country and his friends
The three we sent from off the enchanting ground
We draggd reluctant and by force we bound
The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore
Or the charm tasted had returnd no more
Now placed in order on their banks they sweep
The seas smooth face and cleave the hoary deep
With heavy hearts we labour through the tide
To coasts unknown and oceans yet untried

The land of Cyclops first a savage kind
Nor tamed by manners nor by laws confined
Untaught to plant to turn the glebe and sow
They all their products to free nature owe
The soil untilld a ready harvest yields
With wheat and barley wave the golden fields
Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour
And Jove descends in each prolific shower
By these no statues and no rights are known
No council held no monarch fills the throne
But high on hills or airy cliffs they dwell
Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell
Each rules his race his neighbour not his care
Heedless of others to his own severe

Opposed to the Cyclopean coast there lay
An isle whose hill their subject fields survey
Its name Lachaea crownd with many a grove
Where savage goats through pathless thickets rove
No needy mortals here with hunger bold
Or wretched hunters through the wintry cold
Pursue their flight but leave them safe to bound
From hill to hill oer all the desert ground
Nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care
Or feels the labours of the crooked share
But uninhabited untilld unsown
It lies and breeds the bleating goat alone
For there no vessel with vermilion prore
Or bark of traffic glides from shore to shore
The rugged race of savages unskilld
The seas to traverse or the ships to build
Gaze on the coast nor cultivate the soil
Unlearnd in all the industrious art of toil
Yet here all produces and all plants abound
Sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground
Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen
And vines that flourish in eternal green
Refreshing meads along the murmuring main
And fountains streaming down the fruitful plain

A port there is inclosed on either side
Where ships may rest unanchord and untied
Till the glad mariners incline to sail
And the sea whitens with the rising gale
High at the head from out the cavernd rock
In living rills a gushing fountain broke
Around it and above for ever green
The busy alders formd a shady scene
Hither some favouring god beyond our thought
Through all surrounding shade our navy brought
For gloomy night descended on the main
Nor glimmerd Phoebe in the ethereal plain
But all unseen the clouded island lay
And all unseen the surge and rolling sea
Till safe we anchord in the shelterd bay
Our sails we gatherd cast our cables oer
And slept secure along the sandy shore
Soon as again the rosy morning shone
Reveald the landscape and the scene unknown
With wonder seized we view the pleasing ground
And walk delighted and expatiate round
Roused by the woodland nymphs at early dawn
The mountain goats came bounding oer the lawn
In haste our fellows to the ships repair
For arms and weapons of the sylvan war
Straight in three squadrons all our crew we part
And bend the bow or wing the missile dart
The bounteous gods afford a copious prey
And nine fat goats each vessel bears away
The royal bark had ten Our ships complete
We thus supplied for twelve were all the fleet

Here till the setting sun rolld down the light
We sat indulging in the genial rite
Nor wines were wanting those from ample jars
We draind the prize of our Ciconian wars
The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near
The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear
And from their mountains rising smokes appear
Now sunk the sun and darkness coverd oer
The face of things along the seabeat shore
Satiate we slept but when the sacred dawn
Arising glitterd oer the dewy lawn
I calld my fellows and these words addressd
My dear associates here indulge your rest
While with my single ship adventurous I
Go forth the manners of you men to try
Whether a race unjust of barbarous might
Rude and unconscious of a strangers right
Or such who harbour pity in their breast
Revere the gods and succour the distressd

This said I climbd my vessels lofty side
My train obeyd me and the ship untied
In order seated on their banks they sweep
Neptunes smooth face and cleave the yielding deep
When to the nearest verge of land we drew
Fast by the sea a lonely cave we view
High and with darkening laurels covered oer
Were sheep and goats lay slumbering round the shore
Near this a fence of marble from the rock
Brown with oeraching pine and spreading oak
A giant shepherd here his flock maintains
Far from the rest and solitary reigns
In shelter thick of horrid shade reclined
And gloomy mischiefs labour in his mind
A form enormous far unlike the race
Of human birth in stature or in face
As some lone mountains monstrous growth he stood
Crownd with rough thickets and a nodding wood
I left my vessel at the point of land
And close to guard it gave our crew command
With only twelve the boldest and the best
I seek the adventure and forsake the rest
Then took a goatskin filld with precious wine
The gift of Maron of Evantheus line
The priest of Phoebus at the Ismarian shrine
In sacred shade his honourd mansion stood
Amidst Apollos consecrated wood
Him and his house Heaven moved my mind to save
And costly presents in return he gave
Seven golden talents to perfection wrought
A silver bowl that held a copious draught
And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine
Mellifluous undecaying and divine
Which now some ages from his race conceald
The hoary sire in gratitude reveald
Such was the wine to quench whose fervent steam
Scarce twenty measures from the living stream
To cool one cup sufficed the goblet crownd
Breathed aromatic fragrances around
Of this an ample vase we heaved aboard
And brought another with provisions stored
My soul foreboded I should find the bower
Of some fell monster fierce with barbarous power
Some rustic wretch who lived in Heavens despite
Contemning laws and trampling on the right
The cave we found but vacant all within
His flock the giant tended on the green
But round the grot we gaze and all we view
In order ranged our admiration drew
The bending shelves with loads of cheeses pressd
The folded flocks each separate from the rest
The larger here and there the lesser lambs
The newfallen young here bleating for their dams
The kid distinguishd from the lambkin lies
The cavern echoes with responsive cries
Capacious chargers all around were laid
Full pails and vessels of the milking trade
With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store
My friends advise me and to quit the shore
Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away
Consult our safety and put off to sea
Their wholesome counsel rashly I declined
Curious to view the man of monstrous kind
And try what social rites a savage lends
Dire rites alas and fatal to my friends

Then first a fire we kindle and prepare
For his return with sacrifice and prayer
The loaden shelves afford us full repast
We sit expecting Lo he comes at last
Near half a forest on his back he bore
And cast the ponderous burden at the door
It thunderd as it fell We trembled then
And sought the deep recesses of the den
New driven before him through the arching rock
Came tumbling heaps on heaps the unnumberd flock
Bigudderd ewes and goats of female kind
The males were pennd in outward courts behind
Then heaved on high a rocks enormous weight
To the caves mouth he rolld and closed the gate
Scarce twenty fourwheeld cars compact and strong
The massy load could bear or roll along
He next betakes him to his evening cares
And sitting down to milk his flocks prepares
Of half their udders eases first the dams
Then to the mothers teat submits the lambs
Half the white stream to hardening cheese be pressd
And high in wickerbaskets heapd the rest
Reserved in bowls supplied his nightly feast
His labour done he fired the pile that gave
A sudden blaze and lighted all the cave
We stand discoverd by the rising fires
Askance the giant glares and thus inquires

What are ye guests on what adventure say
Thus far ye wander through the watery way
Pirates perhaps who seek through seas unknown
The lives of others and expose your own

His voice like thunder through the cavern sounds
My bold companions thrilling fear confounds
Appalld at sight of more than mortal man
At length with heart recoverd I began

From Troys famed fields sad wanderers oer the main
Behold the relics of the Grecian train
Through various seas by various perils tossd
And forced by storms unwilling on your coast
Far from our destined course and native land
Such was our fate and such high Joves command
Nor what we are befits us to disclaim
Atrides friends in arms a mighty name
Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow
Victors of late but humble suppliants now
Low at thy knee thy succour we implore
Respect us human and relieve us poor
At least some hospitable gift bestow
Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe
Tis what the gods require those gods revere
The poor and stranger are their constant care
To Jove their cause and their revenge belongs
He wanders with them and he feels their wrongs

Fools that ye are the savage thus replies
His inward fury blazing at his eyes
Or strangers distant far from our abodes
To bid me reverence or regard the gods
Know then we Cyclops are a race above
Those airbred people and their goatnursed Jove
And learn our power proceeds with thee and thine
Not as he wills but as ourselves incline
But answer the good ship that brought ye oer
Where lies she anchord near or off the shore

Thus he His meditated fraud I find
Versed in the turns of various humankind
And cautious thus Against a dreadful rock
Fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke
Scarce with these few I scaped of all my train
Whom angry Neptune whelmd beneath the main
The scattered wreck the winds blew back again

He answerd with his deed his bloody hand
Snatchd two unhappy of my martial band
And dashd like dogs against the stony floor
The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore
Torn limb from limb he spreads his horrid feast
And fierce devours it like a mountain beast
He sucks the marrow and the blood he drains
Nor entrails flesh nor solid bone remains
We see the death from which we cannot move
And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove
His ample maw with human carnage filld
A milky deluge next the giant swilld
Then stretchd in length oer half the cavernd rock
Lay senseless and supine amidst the flock
To seize the time and with a sudden wound
To fix the slumbering monster to the ground
My soul impels me and in act I stand
To draw the sword but wisdom held my hand
A deed so rash had finished all our fate
No mortal forces from the lofty gate
Could roll the rock In hopeless grief we lay
And sigh expecting the return of day
Now did the rosyfingered morn arise
And shed her sacred light along the skies
He wakes he lights the fire he milks the dams
And to the mothers teats submits the lambs
The task thus finishd of his morning hours
Two more he snatches murders and devours
Then pleased and whistling drives his flock before
Removes the rocky mountain from the door
And shuts again with equal ease disposed
As a light quivers lid is oped and closed
His giant voice the echoing region fills
His flocks obedient spread oer all the hills

Thus left behind even in the last despair
I thought devised and Pallas heard my prayer
Revenge and doubt and caution workd my breast
But this of many counsels seemd the best
The monsters club within the cave I spied
A tree of stateliest growth and yet undried
Green from the wood of height and bulk so vast
The largest ship might claim it for a mast
This shortend of its top I gave my train
A fathoms length to shape it and to plane
The narrower end I sharpend to a spire
Whose point we hardend with the force of fire
And hid it in the dust that strewd the cave
Then to my few companions bold and brave
Proposed who first the venturous deed should try
In the broad orbit of his monstrous eye
To plunge the brand and twirl the pointed wood
When slumber next should tame the man of blood
Just as I wished the lots were cast on four
Myself the fifth We stand and wait the hour
He comes with evening all his fleecy flock
Before him march and pour into the rock
Not one or male or female stayed behind
So fortune chanced or so some god designed
Then heaving high the stones unwieldy weight
He rolld it on the cave and closed the gate
First down he sits to milk the woolly dams
And then permits their udder to the lambs
Next seized two wretches more and headlong cast
Braind on the rock his second dire repast
I then approachd him reeking with their gore
And held the brimming goblet foaming oer
Cyclop since human flesh has been thy feast
Now drain this goblet potent to digest
Know hence what treasures in our ship we lost
And what rich liquors other climates boast
We to thy shore the precious freight shall bear
If home thou send us and vouchsafe to spare
But oh thus furious thirsting thus for gore
The sons of men shall neer approach thy shore
And never shalt thou taste this nectar more

He heard he took and pouring down his throat
Delighted swilld the large luxurious draught
More give me more he cried the boon be thine
Whoeer thou art that bearst celestial wine
Declare thy name not mortal is this juice
Such as the unblessd Cyclopaean climes produce
Though sure our vine the largest cluster yields
And Joves scornd thunder serves to drench our fields
But this descended from the blessd abodes
A rill of nectar streaming from the gods

He said and greedy grasped the heady bowl
Thrice drained and poured the deluge on his soul
His sense lay covered with the dozy fume
While thus my fraudful speech I reassume
Thy promised boon O Cyclop now I claim
And plead my title Noman is my name
By that distinguishd from my tender years
Tis what my parents call me and my peers

The giant then Our promisd grace receive
The hospitable boon we mean to give
When all thy wretched crew have felt my power
Noman shall be the last I will devour

He said then nodding with the fumes of wine
Droopd his huge head and snoring lay supine
His neck obliquely oer his shoulders hung
Pressd with the weight of sleep that tames the strong
There belchd the mingled streams of wine and blood
And human flesh his indigested food
Sudden I stir the embers and inspire
With animating breath the seeds of fire
Each drooping spirit with bold words repair
And urged my train the dreadful deed to dare
The stake now glowd beneath the burning bed
Green as it was and sparkled fiery red
Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring
With beating hearts my fellows form a ring
Urged my some present god they swift let fall
The pointed torment on his visual ball
Myself above them from a rising ground
Guide the sharp stake and twirl it round and round
As when a shipwright stands his workmen oer
Who ply the wimble some huge beam to bore
Urged on all hands it nimbly spins about
The grain deeppiercing till it scoops it out
In his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood
From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood
Singed are his brows the scorching lids grow black
The jelly bubbles and the fibres crack
And as when armourers temper in the ford
The keenedged poleaxe or the shining sword
The redhot metal hisses in the lake
Thus in his eyeball hissd the plunging stake
He sends a dreadful groan the rocks around
Through all their inmost winding caves resound
Scared we recoiled Forth with frantic hand
He tore and dashd on earth and gory brand
Then calls the Cyclops all that round him dwell
With voice like thunder and a direful yell
From all their dens the oneeyed race repair
From rifted rocks and mountains bleak in air
All haste assembled at his wellknown roar
Inquire the cause and crowd the cavern door

What hurts thee Polypheme what strange affright
Thus breaks our slumbers and disturbs the night
Does any mortal in the unguarded hour
Of sleep oppress thee or by fraud or power
Or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprise
Thus they the Cyclop from his den replies

Friends Noman kills me Noman in the hour
Of sleep oppresses me with fraudful power
If no man hurt thee but the hand divine
Inflict disease it fits thee to resign
To Jove or to thy father Neptune pray
The brethren cried and instant strode away
Joy touchd my secret soul and conscious heart
Pleased with the effect of conduct and of art
Meantime the Cyclop raging with his wound
Spreads his wide arms and searches round and round
At last the stone removing from the gate
With hands extended in the midst he sate
And searchd each passing sheep and fell it oer
Secure to seize us ere we reachd the door
Such as his shallow wit he deemd was mine
But secret I revolved the deep design
Twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought
Each scheme I turnd and sharpend every thought
This way and that I cast to save my friends
Till one resolve my varying counsel ends

Strong were the rams with native purple fair
Well fed and largest of the fleecy care
These three and three with osier bands we tied
The twining bands the Cyclops bed supplied
The midmost bore a man the outward two
Secured each side so bound we all the crew
One ram remaind the leader of the flock
In his deep fleece my grasping hands I lock
And fast beneath in wooly curls inwove
There cling implicit and confide in Jove
When rosy morning glimmerd oer the dales
He drove to pasture all the lusty males
The ewes still folded with distended thighs
Unmilkd lay bleating in distressful cries
But heedless of those cares with anguish stung
He felt their fleeces as they passd along
Fool that he was and let them safely go
All unsuspecting of their freight below

The master ram at last approachd the gate
Charged with his wool and with Ulysses fate
Him while he passd the monster blind bespoke
What makes my ram the lag of all the flock
First thou wert wont to crop the flowery mead
First to the field and rivers bank to lead
And first with stately step at evening hour
Thy fleecy fellows usher to their bower
Now far the last with pensive pace and slow
Thou movest as conscious of thy masters woe
Seest thou these lids that now unfold in vain
The deed of Noman and his wicked train
Oh didst thou feel for thy afflicted lord
And would but Fate the power of speech afford
Soon mightst thou tell me where in secret here
The dastard lurks all trembling with his fear
Swung round and round and dashd from rock to rock
His battered brains should on the pavement smoke
No ease no pleasure my sad heart receives
While such a monster as vile Noman lives

The giant spoke and through the hollow rock
Dismissd the ram the father of the flock
No sooner freed and through the inclosure passd
First I release myself my fellows last
Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before
And reach our vessel on the winding shore
With joy the sailors view their friends returnd
And hail us living whom as dead they mournd
Big tears of transport stand in every eye
I check their fondness and command to fly
Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep
And snatch their oars and rush into the deep
Now off at sea and from the shallows clear
As far as human voice could reach the ear
With taunts the distant giant I accost
Hear me O Cyclop hear ungracious host
Twas on no coward no ignoble slave
Thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave
But one the vengeance fated from above
Doomd to inflict the instrument of Jove
Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands
The god the god revenges by my hands

These words the Cyclops burning rage provoke
From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock
High oer the billows flew the massy load
And near the ship came thundering on the flood
It almost brushd the helm and fell before
The whole sea shook and refluent beat the shore
The strong concussion on the heaving tide
Rolld back the vessel to the islands side
Again I shoved her off our fate to fly
Each nerve we stretch and every oar we ply
Just scaped impending death when now again
We twice as far had furrowd back the main
Once more I raise my voice my friends afraid
With mild entreaties my design dissuade
What boots the godless giant to provoke
Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke
Already when the dreadful rock he threw
Old Ocean shook and back his surges flew
The sounding voice directs his aim again
The rock oerwhelms us and we scaped in vain

But I of mind elate and scorning fear
Thus with new taunts insult the monsters ear
Cyclop if any pitying thy disgrace
Ask who disfigured thus that eyeless face
Say twas Ulysses twas his deed declare
Laertes son of Ithaca the fair
Ulysses far in fighting fields renownd
Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground

The astonished savage with a roar replies
Oh heavens oh faith of ancient prophecies
This Telemus Eurymedes foretold
The mighty seer who on these hills grew old
Skilld the dark fates of mortals to declare
And learnd in all wingd omens of the air
Long since he menaced such was Fates command
And named Ulysses as the destined hand
I deemd some godlike giant to behold
Or lofty hero haughty brave and bold
Not this weak pigmy wretch of mean design
Who not by strength subdued me but by wine
But come accept our gifts and join to pray
Great Neptunes blessing on the watery way
For his I am and I the lineage own
The immortal father no less boasts the son
His power can heal me and relight my eye
And only his of all the gods on high
Oh could this arm I thus aloud rejoind
From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind
And send thee howling to the realms of night
As sure as Neptune cannot give thee sight
Thus I while raging he repeats his cries
With hands uplifted to the starry skies
Hear me O Neptune thou whose arms are hurld
From shore to shore and gird the solid world
If thine I am nor thou my birth disown
And if the unhappy Cyclop be thy son
Let not Ulysses breathe his native air
Laertes son of Ithaca the fair
If to review his country be his fate
Be it through toils and sufferings long and late
His lost companions let him first deplore
Some vessel not his own transport him oer
And when at home from foreign sufferings freed
More near and deep domestic woes succeed
With imprecations thus he filld the air
And angry Neptune heard the unrighteous prayer
A larger rock then heaving from the plain
He whirld it round it sung across the main
It fell and brushd the stern the billows roar
Shake at the weight and refluent beat the shore
With all our force we kept aloof to sea
And gaind the island where our vessels lay
Our sight the whole collected navy cheerd
Who waiting long by turns had hoped and feard
There disembarking on the green sea side
We land our cattle and the spoil divide
Of these due shares to every sailor fall
The master ram was voted mine by all
And him the guardian of Ulysses fate
With pious mind to heaven I consecrate
But the great god whose thunder rends the skies
Averse beholds the smoking sacrifice
And sees me wandering still from coast to coast
And all my vessels all my people lost
While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite
As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite
Till evening Phoebus rolld away the light
Stretchd on the shore in careless ease we rest
Till ruddy morning purpled oer the east
Then from their anchors all our ships unbind
And mount the decks and call the willing wind
Now ranged in order on our banks we sweep
With hasty strokes the hoarseresounding deep
Blind to the future pensive with our fears
Glad for the living for the dead in tears



BOOK X

ARGUMENT

ADVENTURES WITH AEOLUS THE LAESTRYGONS AND CIRCE

Ulysses arrives at the island of AEolus who gives him prosperous
winds and incloses the adverse ones in a bag which his
companions untying they are driven back again and rejected
Then they sail to the Laestrygons where they lose eleven ships
and with only one remaining proceed to the island of Circe
Eurylochus is sent first with some companions all which except
Eurylochus are transformed into swine Ulysses then undertakes
the adventure and by the help of Mercury who gives him the herb
Moly overcomes the enchantress and procures the restoration of
his men After a years stay with her he prepares at her
instigation for his voyage to the infernal shades



AT length we reachd AEoliass seagirt shore
Where great Hippotades the sceptre bore
A floating isle highraised by toil divine
Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine
Six blooming youths in private grandeur bred
And six fair daughters graced the royal bed
These sons their sisters wed and all remain
Their parents pride and pleasure of their reign
All day they feast all day the bowls flow round
And joy and music through the isle resound
At night each pair on splendid carpets lay
And crownd with love the pleasures of the day
This happy port affords our wandering fleet
A months reception and a safe retreat
Full oft the monarch urged me to relate
The fall of Ilion and the Grecian fate
Full oft I told at length for parting moved
The king with mighty gifts my suit approved
The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced
Compressd their force and lockd each struggling blast
For him the mighty sire of gods assignd
The tempests lood the tyrant of the wind
His word alone the listening storms obey
To smooth the deep or swell the foamy sea
These in my hollow ship the monarch hung
Securely fetterd by a silver thong
But Zephyrus exempt with friendly gales
He charged to fill and guide the swelling sails
Rare gift but O what gift to fools avails

Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar
The tenth presents our welcome native shore
The hills display the beacons friendly light
And rising mountains gain upon our sight
Then first my eyes by watchful toils oppressd
Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest
Then first my hands did from the rudder part
So much the love of home possessd my heart
When lo on board a fond debate arose
What rare device those vessels might inclose
What sum what prize from AEolus I brought
Whilst to his neighbour each expressd his thought

Say whence ye gods contending nations strive
Who most shall please who most our hero give
Long have his coffers groand with Trojan spoils
Whilst we the wretched partners of his toils
Reproachd by want our fruitless labours mourn
And only rich in barren fame return
Now AEolus ye see augments his store
But come my friends these mystic gifts explore
They said and oh cursed fate the thongs unbound
The gushing tempest sweeps the ocean round
Snatchd in the whirl the hurried navy flew
The ocean widend and the shores withdrew
Roused from my fatal sleep I long debate
If still to live or desperate plunge to fate
Thus doubting prostrate on the deck I lay
Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way

Meanwhile our vessels plough the liquid plain
And soon the known AEolian coast regain
Our groan the rocks remurmurd to the main
We leapd on shore and with a scanty feast
Our thirst and hunger hastily repressd
That done two chosen heralds straight attend
Our second progress to my royal friend
And him amidst his jovial sons we found
The banquet steaming and the goblets crownd
There humbly stoopd with conscious shame and awe
Nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw
But soon his sons their wellknown guest descried
And starting from their couches loudly cried
Ulysses here what demon couldst thou meet
To thwart thy passage and repel thy fleet
Wast thou not furnishd by our choicest care
For Greece for home and all thy soul held dear
Thus they In silence long my fate I mournd
At length these words with accents low returnd
Me lockd in sleep my faithless crew bereft
Of all the blessing of your godlike gift
But grant oh grant our loss we may retrieve
A favour you and you alone can give

Thus I with art to move their pity tried
And touchd the youths but their stern sire replied
Vile wretch begone this instant I command
Thy fleet accursed to leave our hallowd land
His baneful suit pollutes these blessd abodes
Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods

Thus fierce he said we sighing went our way
And with desponding hearts put off to sea
The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn
But mourn in vain no prospect of return
Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer
The next proud Lamos stately towers appear
And Laestrygonias gates arise distinct in air
The shepherd quitting here at night the plain
Calls to succeed his cares the watchful swain
But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear
And adds the herdsmans to the shepherds care
So near the pastures and so short the way
His double toils may claim a double pay
And join the labours of the night and day

Within a long recess a bay there lies
Edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies
The jutting shores that swell on either side
Contract its mouth and break the rushing tide
Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat
And bound within the port their crowded fleet
For here retired the sinking billows sleep
And smiling calmness silverd oer the deep
I only in the bay refused to moor
And fixd without my halsers to the shore

From thence we climbd a point whose airy brow
Commands the prospect of the plains below
No tracks of beasts or signs of men we found
But smoky volumes rolling from the ground
Two with our herald thither we command
With speed to learn what men possessd the land
They went and kept the wheels smoothbeaten road
Which to the city drew the mountain wood
When lo they met beside a crystal spring
The daughter of Antiphates the king
She to Artacias silver streams came down
Artacias streams alone supply the town
The damsel they approach and askd what race
The people were who monarch of the place
With joy the maid the unwary strangers heard
And showd them where the royal dome appeard
They went but as they entering saw the queen
Of size enormous and terrific mien
Not yielding to some bulky mountains height
A sudden horror struck their aching sight
Swift at her call her husband scourd away
To wreak his hunger on the destined prey
One for his food the raging glutton slew
But two rushd out and to the navy flew

Balkd of his prey the yelling monster flies
And fills the city with his hideous cries
A ghastly band of giants hear the roar
And pouring down the mountains crowd the shore
Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow
And dash the ruins on the ships below
The crackling vessels burst hoarse groans arise
And mingled horrors echo to the skies
The men like fish they struck upon the flood
And crammd their filthy throats with human food
Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay
My sword our cables cut I calld to weigh
And charged my men as they from fate would fly
Each nerve to strain each bending oar to ply
The sailors catch the word their oars they seize
And sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas
Clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies
Whilst in the port each wretch encumberd dies
With earnest haste my frighted sailors press
While kindling transports glowd at our success
But the sad fate that did our friends destroy
Coold every breast and dampd the rising joy

Now droppd our anchors in the Aeaean bay
Where Circe dwelt the daughter of the Day
Her mother Perse of old Oceans strain
Thus from the Lun descended and the Main
From the same lineage stern Aeaetes came
The farfamed brother of the enchantress dame
Goddess the queen to whom the powers belong
Of dreadful magic and commanding song
Some god directing to this peaceful bay
Silent we came and melancholy lay
Spent and oerwatchd Two days and nights rolld on
And now the third succeeding morning shone
I climbd a cliff with spear and sword in hand
Whose ridge oerlookd a shady length of land
To learn if aught of mortal works appear
Or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear
From the high point I markd in distant view
A stream of curling smoke ascending blue
And spiry tops the tufted trees above
Of Circes palace bosomd in the grove

Thither to haste the region to explore
Was first my thought but speeding back to shore
I deemd it best to visit first my crew
And send our spies the dubious coast to view
As down the hill I solitary go
Some power divine who pities human woe
Sent a tall stag descending from the wood
To cool his fervour in the crystal flood
Luxuriant on the waveworn bank he lay
Stretchd forth and panting in the sunny ray
I launchd my spear and with a sudden wound
Transpierced his back and fixd him to the ground
He falls and mourns his fate with human cries
Through the wide wound the vital spirit flies
I drew and casting on the rivers side
The bloody spear his gatherd feet I tied
With twining osiers which the bank supplied
An ell in length the pliant wisp I weaved
And the huge body on my shoulders heaved
Then leaning on my spear with both my hands
Upbore my load and pressd the sinking sands
With weighty steps till at the ship I threw
The welcome burden and bespoke my crew

Cheer up my friends it is not yet our fate
To glide with ghosts through Plutos gloomy gate
Food in the desert land behold is given
Live and enjoy the providence of heaven

The joyful crew survey his mighty size
And on the future banquet feast their eyes
As huge in length extended lay the beast
Then wash their hands and hasten to the feast
There till the setting sun rolld down the light
They sate indulging in the genial rite
When evening rose and darkness coverd oer
The face of things we slept along the shore
But when the rosy morning warmd the east
My men I summond and these words addressd
Followers and friends attend what I propose
Ye sad companions of Ulysses woes
We know not here what land before us lies
Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes
Or where the sun shall set or where shall rise
Here let us think if thinking be not vain
If any counsel any hope remain
Alas from yonder promontorys brow
I viewd the coast a region flat and low
An isle encircled with the boundless flood
A length of thickets and entangled wood
Some smoke I saw amid the forest rise
And all around it only seas and skies

With broken hearts my sad companions stood
Mindful of Cyclops and his human food
And horrid Laestrygons the men of blood
Presaging tears apace began to rain
But tears in mortal miseries are vain
In equal parts I straight divide my band
And name a chief each party to command
I led the one and of the other side
Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide
Then in the brazen helm the lots we throw
And fortune casts Eurylochus to go
He marchd with twice eleven in his train
Pensive they march and pensive we remain

The palace in a woody vale they found
High raised of stone a shaded space around
Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam
By magic tamed familiar to the dome
With gentle blandishment our men they meet
And wag their tails and fawning lick their feet
As from some feast a man returning late
His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate
Rejoicing round some morsel to receive
Such as the good man ever used to give
Domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near
They gaze with wonder not unmixd with fear
Now on the threshold of the dome they stood
And heard a voice resounding through the wood
Placed at her loom within the goddess sung
The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung
Oer the fair web the rising figures shine
Immortal labour worthy hands divine
Polites to the rest the question moved
A gallant leader and a man I loved

What voice celestial chanting to the loom
Or nymph or goddess echoes from the room
Say shall we seek access With that they call
And wide unfold the portals of the hall

The goddess rising asks her guests to stay
Who blindly follow where she leads the way
Eurylochus alone of all the band
Suspecting fraud more prudently remaind
On thrones around with downy coverings graced
With semblance fair the unhappy men she placed
Milk newly pressd the sacred flour of wheat
And honey fresh and Pramnian wines the treat
But venomd was the bread and mixd the bowl
With drugs of force to darken all the soul
Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost
And drank oblivion of their native coast
Instant her circling wand the goddess waves
To hogs transforms them and the sty receives
No more was seen the human form divine
Head face and members bristle into swine
Still cursed with sense their minds remain alone
And their own voice affrights them when they groan
Meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows
The mast and acorn brutal food and strows
The fruits and cornel as their feast around
Now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground

Eurylochus with pensive steps and slow
Aghast returns the messenger of woe
And bitter fate To speak he made essay
In vain essayd nor would his tongue obey
His swelling heart denied the words their way
But speaking tears the want of words supply
And the full soul bursts copious from his eye
Affrighted anxious for our fellows fates
We press to hear what sadly he relates

We went Ulysses such was thy command
Through the lone thicket and the desert land
A palace in a woody vale we found
Brown with dark forests and with shades around
A voice celestial echoed through the dome
Or nymph or goddess chanting to the loom
Access we sought nor was access denied
Radiant she came the portals opend wide
The goddess mild invites the guests to stay
They blindly follow where she leads the way
I only wait behind of all the train
I waited long and eyed the doors in vain
The rest are vanishd none repassd the gate
And not a man appears to tell their fate

I heard and instant oer my shoulder flung
The belt in which my weighty falchion hung
A beamy blade then seized the bended bow
And bade him guide the way resolved to go
He prostrate falling with both hands embraced
My knees and weeping thus his suit addressd

O king beloved of Jove thy servant spare
And ah thyself the rash attempt forbear
Never alas thou never shalt return
Or see the wretched for whose loss we mourn
With what remains from certain ruin fly
And save the few not fated yet to die

I answerd stern Inglorious then remain
Here feast and loiter and desert thy train
Alone unfriended will I tempt my way
The laws of fate compel and I obey
This said and scornful turning from the shore
My haughty step I stalkd the valley oer
Till now approaching nigh the magic bower
Where dwelt the enchantress skilld in herbs of power
A form divine forth issued from the wood
Immortal Hermes with the golden rod
In human semblance On his bloomy face
Youth smiled celestial with each opening grace
He seized my hand and gracious thus began
Ah whither roamst thou muchenduring man
O blind to fate what led thy steps to rove
The horrid mazes of this magic grove
Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies
All lost their form and habitants of sties
Thinkst thou by wit to model their escape
Sooner shalt thou a stranger to thy shape
Fall prone their equal first thy danger know
Then take the antidote the gods bestow
The plant I give through all the direful bower
Shall guard thee and avert the evil hour
Now hear her wicked arts Before thy eyes
The bowl shall sparkle and the banquet rise
Take this nor from the faithless feast abstain
For temperd drugs and poison shall be vain
Soon as she strikes her wand and gives the word
Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword
And menace death those menaces shall move
Her alterd mind to blandishment and love
Nor shun the blessing profferd to thy arms
Ascend her bed and taste celestial charms
So shall thy tedious toils a respite find
And thy lost friends return to human kind
But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie
The powers below the blessed in the sky
Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant
Or magic bind thee cold and impotent

Thus while he spoke the sovereign plant he drew
Where on the allbearing earth unmarkd it grew
And showd its nature and its wondrous power
Black was the root but milky white the flower
Moly the name to mortals hard to find
But all is easy to the ethereal kind
This Hermes gave then gliding off the glade
Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade
While full of thought revolving fates to come
I speed my passage to the enchanted dome
Arrived before the lofty gates I stayd
The lofty gates the goddess wide displayd
She leads before and to the feast invites
I follow sadly to the magic rites
Radiant with starry studs a silver seat
Received my limbs a footstool eased my feet
She mixd the potion fraudulent of soul
The poison mantled in the golden bowl
I took and quaffd it confident in heaven
Then waved the wand and then the word was given
Hence to thy fellows dreadful she began
Go be a beastI heard and yet was man

Then sudden whirling like a waving flame
My beamy falchion I assault the dame
Struck with unusual fear she trembling cries
She faints she falls she lifts her weeping eyes

What art thou say from whence from whom you came
O more than human tell thy race thy name
Amazing strength these poisons to sustain
Not mortal thou nor mortal is thy brain
Or art thou he the man to come foretold
By Hermes powerful with the wand of gold
The man from Troy who wanderd ocean round
The man for wisdoms various arts renownd
Ulysses Oh thy threatening fury cease
Sheathe thy bright sword and join our hands in peace
Let mutual joys our mutual trust combine
And love and loveborn confidence be thine

And how dread Circe furious I rejoin
Can love and loveborn confidence be mine
Beneath thy charms when my companions groan
Transformd to beasts with accents not their own
O thou of fraudful heart shall I be led
To share thy feastrites or ascend thy bed
That all unarmd thy vengeance may have vent
And magic bind me cold and impotent
Celestial as thou art yet stand denied
Or swear that oath by which the gods are tied
Swear in thy soul no latent frauds remain
Swear by the vow which never can be vain

The goddess swore then seized my hand and led
To the sweet transports of the genial bed
Ministrant to the queen with busy care
Four faithful handmaids the soft rites prepare
Nymphs sprung from fountains or from shady woods
Or the fair offspring of the sacred floods
One oer the couches painted carpets threw
Whose purple lustre glowd against the view
White linen lay beneath Another placed
The silver stands with golden flaskets graced
With dulcet beverage this the beaker crownd
Fair in the midst with gilded cups around
That in the tripod oer the kindled pile
The water pours the bubbling waters boil
An ample vase receives the smoking wave
And in the bath prepared my limbs I lave
Reviving sweets repair the minds decay
And take the painful sense of toil away
A vest and tunic oer me next she threw
Fresh from the bath and dropping balmy dew
Then led and placed me on the sovereign seat
With carpets spread a footstool at my feet
The golden ewer a nymph obsequious brings
Replenishd from the cool translucent springs
With copious water the bright vase supplies
A silver laver of capacious size
I washd The table in fair order spread
They heap the glittering canisters with bread
Viands of various kinds allure the taste
Of choicest sort and savour rich repast
Circe in vain invites the feast to share
Absent I ponder and absorbd in care
While scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast
The queen beheld me and these words addressd

Why sits Ulysses silent and apart
Some hoard of grief close harbourd at his heart
Untouchd before thee stand the cates divine
And unregarded laughs the rosy wine
Can yet a doubt or any dread remain
When sworn that oath which never can be vain

I answered Goddess human is my breast
By justice swayd by tender pity pressd
Ill fits it me whose friends are sunk to beasts
To quaff thy bowls or riot in thy feasts
Me wouldst thou please for them thy cares employ
And them to me restore and me to joy

With that she parted in her potent hand
She bore the virtue of the magic wand
Then hastening to the sties set wide the door
Urged forth and drove the bristly herd before
Unwieldy out they rushd with general cry
Enormous beasts dishonest to the eye
Now touchd by countercharms they change again
And stand majestic and recalld to men
Those hairs of late that bristled every part
Fall off miraculous effect of art
Till all the form in full proportion rise
More young more large more graceful to my eyes
They saw they knew me and with eager pace
Clung to their master in a long embrace
Sad pleasing sight with tears each eye ran oer
And sobs of joy reechoed through the bower
Een Circe wept her adamantine heart
Felt pity enter and sustaind her part

Son of Laertes then the queen began
Oh muchenduring much experienced man
Haste to thy vessel on the seabeat shore
Unload thy treasures and the galley moor
Then bring thy friends secure from future harms
And in our grottoes stow thy spoils and arms

She said Obedient to her high command
I quit the place and hasten to the strand
My sad companions on the beach I found
Their wistful eyes in floods of sorrow drownd

As from fresh pastures and the dewy field
When loaded cribs their evening banquet yield
The lowing herds return around them throng
With leaps and bounds their late imprisond young
Rush to their mothers with unruly joy
And echoing hills return the tender cry
So round me pressd exulting at my sight
With cries and agonies of wild delight
The weeping sailors nor less fierce their joy
Than if returnd to Ithaca from Troy
Ah master ever honourd ever dear
These tender words on every side I hear
What other joy can equal thy return
Not that loved country for whose sight we mourn
The soil that nursed us and that gave us breath
But ah relate our lost companions death

I answerd cheerful Haste your galley moor
And bring our treasures and our arms ashore
Those in yon hollow caverns let us lay
Then rise and follow where I lead the way
Your fellows live believe your eyes and come
To taste the joys of Circes sacred dome

With ready speed the joyful crew obey
Alone Eurylochus persuades their stay

Whither he cried ah whither will ye run
Seek ye to meet those evils ye should shun
Will you the terrors of the dome explore
In swine to grovel or in lions roar
Or wolflike howl away the midnight hour
In dreadful watch around the magic bower
Remember Cyclops and his bloody deed
The leaders rashness made the soldiers bleed

I heard incensed and first resolved to speed
My flying falchion at the rebels head
Dear as he was by ties of kindred bound
This hand had stretchd him breathless on the ground
But all at once my interposing train
For mercy pleaded nor could plead in vain
Leave here the man who dares his prince desert
Leave to repentance and his own sad heart
To guard the ship Seek we the sacred shades
Of Circes palace where Ulysses leads

This with one voice declared the rising train
Left the black vessel by the murmuring main
Shame touchd Eurylochus alterd breast
He feard my threats and followd with the rest

Meanwhile the goddess with indulgent cares
And social joys the late transformd repairs
The bath the feast their fainting soul renews
Rich in refulgent robes and dropping balmy dews
Brightening with joy their eager eyes behold
Each others face and each his story told
Then gushing tears the narrative confound
And with their sobs the vaulted roof resound
When hushd their passion thus the goddess cries
Ulysses taught by labours to be wise
Let this short memory of grief suffice
To me are known the various woes ye bore
In storms by sea in perils on the shore
Forget whatever was in Fortunes power
And share the pleasures of this genial hour
Such be your mind as ere ye left your coast
Or learnd to sorrow for a country lost
Exiles and wanderers now whereer ye go
Too faithful memory renews your woe
The cause removed habitual griefs remain
And the soul saddens by the use of pain

Her kind entreaty moved the general breast
Tired with long toil we willing sunk to rest
We plied the banquet and the bowl we crownd
Till the full circle of the year came round
But when the seasons following in their train
Brought back the months the days and hours again
As from a lethargy at once they rise
And urge their chief with animating cries

Is this Ulysses our inglorious lot
And is the name of Ithaca forgot
Shall never the dear land in prospect rise
Or the loved palace glitter in our eyes
Melting I heard yet till the suns decline
Prolongd the feast and quaffd the rosy wine
But when the shades came on at evening hour
And all lay slumbering in the dusky bower
I came a suppliant to fair Circes bed
The tender moment seized and thus I said
Be mindful goddess of thy promise made
Must sad Ulysses ever be delayd
Around their lord my sad companions mourn
Each breast beats homeward anxious to return
If but a moment parted from thy eyes
Their tears flow round me and my heart complies

Go then she cried ah go yet think not I
Not Circe but the Fates your wish deny
Ah hope not yet to breathe thy native air
Far other journey first demands thy care
To tread the uncomfortable paths beneath
And view the realms of darkness and of death
There seek the Theban bard deprived of sight
Within irradiate with prophetic light
To whom Persephone entire and whole
Gave to retain the unseparated soul
The rest are forms of empty ether made
Impassive semblance and a flitting shade

Struck at the word my very heart was dead
Pensive I sate my tears bedewd the bed
To hate the light and life my soul begun
And saw that all was grief beneath the sun
Composed at length the gushing tears suppressd
And my tossd limbs now wearied into rest
How shall I tread I cried ah Circe say
The dark descent and who shall guide the way
Can living eyes behold the realms below
What bark to waft me and what wind to blow

Thy fated road the magic power replied
Divine Ulysses ask no mortal guide
Rear but the mast the spacious sail display
The northern winds shall wing thee on thy way
Soon shalt thou reach old Oceans utmost ends
Where to the main the shelving shore descends
The barren trees of Proserpines black woods
Poplars and willows trembling oer the floods
There fix thy vessel in the lonely bay
And enter there the kingdoms void of day
Where Phlegethons loud torrents rushing down
Hiss in the flaming gulf of Acheron
And where slow rolling from the Stygian bed
Cocytus lamentable waters spread
Where the dark rock oerhangs the infernal lake
And mingling streams eternal murmurs make
First draw thy falchion and on every side
Trench the black earth a cubit long and wide
To all the shades around libations pour
And oer the ingredients strew the hallowd flour
New wine and milk with honey temperd bring
And living water from the crystal spring
Then the wan shades and feeble ghosts implore
With promised offerings on thy native shore
A barren cow the stateliest of the isle
And heapd with various wealth a blazing pile
These to the rest but to the seer must bleed
A sable ram the pride of all thy breed
These solemn vows and holy offerings paid
To all the phantom nations of the dead
Be next thy care the sable sheep to place
Full oer the pit and hellward turn their face
But from the infernal rite thine eye withdraw
And back to Ocean glance with reverend awe
Sudden shall skim along the dusky glades
Thin airy shoals and visionary shades
Then give command the sacrifice to haste
Let the flayd victims in the flame be cast
And sacred vows and mystic song applied
To grisly Pluto and his gloomy bride
Wide oer the pool thy falchion waved around
Shall drive the spectres from unbidden ground
The sacred draught shall all the dead forbear
Till awful from the shades arise the seer
Let him oraculous the end the way
The turns of all thy future fate display
Thy pilgrimage to come and remnant of thy day

So speaking from the ruddy orient shone
The morn conspicuous on her golden throne
The goddess with a radiant tunic dressd
My limbs and oer me cast a silken vest
Long flowing robes of purest white array
The nymph that added lustre to the day
A tiar wreathd her head with many a fold
Her waist was circled with a zone of gold
Forth issuing then from place to place I flew
Rouse man by man and animate my crew
Rise rise my mates tis Circe gives command
Our journey calls us haste and quit the land
All rise and follow yet depart not all
For Fate decreed one wretched man to fall

A youth there was Elpenor was he named
Not much for sense nor much for courage famed
The youngest of our band a vulgar soul
Born but to banquet and to drain the bowl
He hot and careless on a turrets height
With sleep repaird the long debauch of night
The sudden tumult stirred him where he lay
And down he hastend but forgot the way
Full headlong from the roof the sleeper fell
And snappd the spinal joint and waked in hell

The rest crowd round me with an eager look
I met them with a sigh and thus bespoke
Already friends ye think your toils are oer
Your hopes already touch your native shore
Alas far otherwise the nymph declares
Far other journey first demands our cares
To tread the uncomfortable paths beneath
The dreary realms of darkness and of death
To seek Tiresias awful shade below
And thence our fortunes and our fates to know

My sad companions heard in deep despair
Frantic they tore their manly growth of hair
To earth they fell the tears began to rain
But tears in mortal miseries are vain
Sadly they fared along the seabeat shore
Still heaved their hearts and still their eyes ran oer
The ready victims at our bark we found
The sable ewe and ram together bound
For swift as thought the goddess had been there
And thence had glided viewless as the air
The paths of gods what mortal can survey
Who eyes their motion who shall trace their way



BOOK XI

ARGUMENT

THE DESCENT INTO HELL

Ulysses continues his narration How he arrived at the land of the
Cimmerians and what ceremonies he performed to invoke the dead
The manner of his descent and the apparition of the shades his
conversation with Elpenor and with Tiresias who informs him in a
prophetic manner of his fortunes to come He meets his mother
Anticles from whom he learns the state of his family He sees the
shades of the ancient heroines afterwards of the heroes and
converses in particular with Agamemnon and Achilles Ajax keeps at
a sullen distance and disdains to answer him He then beholds
Tityus Tantalus Sisyphus Hercules till he is deterred from
further curiosity by the apparition of horrid spectres and the
cries of the wicked in torments



Now to the shores we bend a mournful train
Climb the tall bark and launch into the main
At once the mast we rear at once unbind
The spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
Then pale and pensive stand with cares oppressd
And solemn horror saddens every breast
A freshening breeze the magic power supplied
While the wingd vessel flew along the tide
Our oars we shippd all day the swelling sails
Full from the guiding pilot catchd the gales

Now sunk the sun from his aerial height
And oer the shaded billows rushd the night
When lo we reachd old Oceans utmost bounds
Where rocks control his waves with everduring mounds

There in a lonely land and gloomy cells
The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells
The sun neer views the uncomfortable seats
When radiant he advances or retreats
Unhappy race whom endless night invades
Clouds the dull air and wraps them round in shades

The ship we moor on these obscure abodes
Disbark the sheep an offering to the gods
And hellward bending oer the beach descry
The doleful passage to the infernal sky
The victims vowd to each Tartarian power
Eurylochus and Perimedes bore

Here opend hell all hell I here implored
And from the scabbard drew the shining sword
And trenching the black earth on every side
A cavern formd a cubit long and wide
New wine with honeytemperd milk we bring
Then living waters from the crystal spring
Oer these was strewd the consecrated flour
And on the surface shone the holy store

Now the wan shades we hail the infernal gods
To speed our course and waft us oer the floods
So shall a barren heifer from the stall
Beneath the knife upon your altars fall
So in our palace at our safe return
Rich with unnumberd gifts the pile shall burn
So shall a ram the largest of the breed
Black as these regions to Tiresias bleed

Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid
To all the phantomnations of the dead
Then died the sheep a purple torrent flowd
And all the caverns smoked with streaming blood
When lo appeard along the dusky coasts
Thin airy shoals of visionary ghosts
Fair pensive youths and soft enamourd maids
And witherd elders pale and wrinkled shades
Ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain
Stalkd with majestic port a martial train
These and a thousand more swarmd oer the ground
And all the dire assembly shriekd around
Astonishd at the sight aghast I stood
And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood
Straight I command the sacrifice to haste
Straight the flayd victims to the flames are cast
And mutterd vows and mystic song applied
To grisly Pluto and his gloomy bride

Now swift I waved my falchion oer the blood
Back started the pale throngs and trembling stood
Round the black trench the gore untasted flows
Till awful from the shades Tiresias rose

There wandering through the gloom I first surveyd
New to the realms of death Elpenors shade
His cold remains all naked to the sky
On distant shores unwept unburied lie
Sad at the sight I stand deep fixd in woe
And ere I spoke the tears began to flow

O say what angry power Elpenor led
To glide in shades and wander with the dead
How could thy soul by realms and seas disjoind
Outfly the nimble sail and leave the lagging wind

The ghost replied To hell my doom I owe
Demons accursed dire ministers of woe
My feet through wine unfaithful to their weight
Betrayd me tumbling from a towery height
Staggering I reeld and as I reeld I fell
Luxd the neckjointmy soul descends to hell
But lend me aid I now conjure thee lend
By the soft tie and sacred name of friend
By thy fond consort by thy fathers cares
By loved Telemachus blooming years
For well I know that soon the heavenly powers
Will give thee back today and Circes shores
There pious on my cold remains attend
There call to mind thy poor departed friend
The tribute of a tear is all I crave
And the possession of a peaceful grave
But if unheard in vain compassion plead
Revere the gods The gods avenge the dead
A tomb along the watery margin raise
The tomb with manly arms and trophies grace
To show posterity Elpenor was
There high in air memorial of my name
Fix the smooth oar and bid me live to fame

To whom with tears These rites O mournful shade
Due to thy ghost shall to thy ghost be paid

Still as I spoke the phantom seemd to moan
Tear followd tear and groan succeeded groan
But as my waving sword the blood surrounds
The shade withdrew and mutterd empty sounds

There as the wondrous visions I surveyd
All pale ascends my royal mothers shade
A queen to Troy she saw our legions pass
Now a thin form is all Anticlea was
Struck at the sight I melt with filial woe
And down my cheek the pious sorrows flow
Yet as I shook my falchion oer the blood
Regardless of her son the parent stood

When lo the mighty Theban I behold
To guide his steps he bore a staff of gold
Awful he trod majestic was his look
And from his holy lips these accents broke

Why mortal wanderest thou from cheerful day
To tread the downward melancholy way
What angry gods to these dark regions led
Thee yet alive companion of the deed
But sheathe thy poniard while my tongue relates
Heavens steadfast purpose and thy future fates

While yet he spoke the prophet I obeyd
And in the scabbard plunged the glittering blade
Eager he quaffd the gore and then expressd
Dark things to come the counsels of his breast

Weary of light Ulysses here explores
A prosperous voyage to his native shores
But knowby me unerring Fates disclose
New trains of dangers and new scenes of woes
I see I see thy bark by Neptune tossd
For injured Cyclops and his eyeball lost
Yet to thy woes the gods decree an end
If Heaven thou please and how to please attend
Where on Trinacrian rocks the ocean roars
Graze numerous herds along the verdant shores
Though hunger press yet fly the dangerous prey
The herds are sacred to the god of day
Who all surveys with his extensive eye
Above below on earth and in the sky
Rob not the god and so propitious gales
Attend thy voyage and impel thy sails
But if his herds ye seize beneath the waves
I see thy friends oerwhelmd in liquid graves
The direful wreck Ulysses scarce survives
Ulysses at his country scarce arrives
Strangers thy guides nor there thy labours end
New foes arise domestic ills attend
There foul adulterers to thy bride resort
And lordly gluttons riot in thy court
But vengeance hastes amain These eyes behold
The deathful scene princes on princes rolld
That done a people far from sea explore
Who neer knew salt or heard the billows roar
Or saw gay vessel stem the watery plain
A painted wonder flying on the main
Bear on thy back an oar with strange amaze
A shepherd meeting thee the oar surveys
And names a van there fix it on the plain
To calm the god that holds the watery reign
A threefold offering to his altar bring
A bull a ram a boar and hail the ocean king
But home returnd to each ethereal power
Slay the due victim in the genial hour
So peaceful shalt thou end thy blissful days
And steal thyself from life by slow decays
Unknown to pain in age resign thy breath
When late stern Neptune points the shaft with death
To the dark grave retiring as to rest
Thy people blessing by thy people blessd

Unerring truths O man my lips relate
This is thy life to come and this is fate

To whom unmoved If this the gods prepare
What Heaven ordains the wise with courage bear
But say why yonder on the lonely strands
Unmindful of her son Anticlea stands
Why to the ground she bends her downcast eye
Why is she silent while her son is nigh
The latent cause O sacred seer reveal

Nor this replies the seer will I conceal
Know to the spectres that thy beverage taste
The scenes of life recur and actions past
They seald with truth return the sure reply
The rest repelld a train oblivious fly

The phantomprophet ceased and sunk from sight
To the black palace of eternal night

Still in the dark abodes of death I stood
When near Anticlea moved and drank the blood
Straight all the mother in her soul awakes
And owning her Ulysses thus she speaks
Comest thou my son alive to realms beneath
The dolesome realms of darkness and of death
Comest thou alive from pure ethereal day
Dire is the region dismal is the way
Here lakes profound there floods oppose their waves
There the wide sea with all his billows raves
Or since to dust proud Troy submits her towers
Comest thou a wanderer from the Phrygian shores
Or say since honour calld thee to the field
Hast thou thy Ithaca thy bride beheld

Source of my life I cried from earth I fly
To seek Tiresias in the nether sky
To learn my doom for tossd from woe to woe
In every land Ulysses finds a foe
Nor have these eyes beheld my native shores
Since in the dust proud Troy submits her towers

But when thy soul from her sweet mansion fled
Say what distemper gave thee to the dead
Has lifes fair lamp declined by slow decays
Or swift expired it in a sudden blaze
Say if my sire good old Laertes lives
If yet Telemachus my son survives
Say by his rule is my dominion awed
Or crushd by traitors with an iron rod
Say if my spouse maintains her royal trust
Though tempted chaste and obstinately just
Or if no more her absent lord she wails
But the false woman oer the wife prevails

Thus I and thus the parentshade returns
Thee ever thee thy faithful consort mourns
Whether the night descends or day prevails
Thee she by night and thee by day bewails
Thee in Telemachus thy realm obeys
In sacred groves celestial rites he pays
And shares the banquet in superior state
Graced with such honours as become the great
Thy sire in solitude foments his care
The court is joyless for thou art not there
No costly carpets raise his hoary head
No rich embroidery shines to grace his bed
Even when keen winter freezes in the skies
Rankd with his slaves on earth the monarch lies
Deep are his sighs his visage pale his dress
The garb of woe and habit of distress
And when the autumn takes his annual round
The leafy honours scattering on the ground
Regardless of his years abroad he lies
His bed the leaves his canopy the skies
Thus cares on cares his painful days consume
And bow his age with sorrow to the tomb

For thee my son I wept my life away
For thee through hells eternal dungeons stray
Nor came my fate by lingering pains and slow
Nor bent the silvershafted queen her bow
No dire disease bereaved me of my breath
Thou thou my son wert my disease and death
Unkindly with my love my son conspired
For thee I lived for absent thee expired

Thrice in my arms I strove her shade to bind
Thrice through my arms she slippd like empty wind
Or dreams the vain illusions of the mind
Wild with despair I shed a copious tide
Of flowing tears and thus with sighs replied

Fliest thou loved shade while I thus fondly mourn
Turn to my arms to my embraces turn
Is it ye powers that smile at human harms
Too great a bliss to weep within her arms
Or has hells queen an empty image sent
That wretched I might een my joys lament

O son of woe the pensive shade rejoind
O most inured to grief of all mankind
Tis not the queen of hell who thee deceives
All all are such when life the body leaves
No more the substance of the man remains
Nor bounds the blood along the purple veins
These the funereal flames in atoms bear
To wander with the wind in empty air
While the impassive soul reluctant flies
Like a vain dream to these infernal skies
But from the dark dominions speed the way
And climb the steep ascent to upper day
To thy chaste bride the wondrous story tell
The woes the horrors and the laws of hell

Thus while she spoke in swarms hells empress brings
Daughters and wives of heroes and of kings
Thick and more thick they gather round the blood
Ghost thronged on ghost a dire assembly stood
Dauntless my sword I seize the airy crew
Swift as it flashd along the gloom withdrew
Then shade to shade in mutual forms succeeds
Her race recounts and their illustrious deeds

Tyro began whom great Salmoneus bred
The royal partner of famed Cretheus bed
For fair Enipeus as from fruitful urns
He pours his watery store the virgin burns
Smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride
And in soft mazes rolls a silver tide
As on his banks the maid enamourd roves
The monarch of the deep beholds and loves
In her Enipeus form and borrowd charms
The amorous god descends into her arms
Around a spacious arch of waves he throws
And high in air the liquid mountain rose
Thus in surrounding floods conceald he proves
The pleasing transport and completes his loves
Then softly sighing he the fair addressd
And as he spoke her tender hand he pressd
Hail happy nymph no vulgar births are owed
To the prolific raptures of a god
Lo when nine times the moon renews her horn
Two brother heroes shall from thee be born
Thy early care the future worthies claim
To point them to the arduous paths of fame
But in thy breast the important truth conceal
Nor dare the secret of a god reveal
For know thou Neptune viewst and at my nod
Earth trembles and the waves confess their god

He added not but mounting spurnd the plain
Then plunged into the chambers of the main

Now in the times full process forth she brings
Joves dread vicegerents in two future kings
Oer proud Iolcos Pelias stretchd his reign
And godlike Neleus ruled the Pylian plain
Then fruitful to her Cretheus royal bed
She gallant Pheres and famed Aeson bred
From the same fountain Amythaon rose
Pleased with the din of scar and noble shout of foes

There moved Antiope with haughty charms
Who blessd the almighty Thunderer in her arms
Hence sprung Amphion hence brave Zethus came
Founders of Thebes and men of mighty name
Though bold in open field they yet surround
The town with walls and mound inject on mound
Here ramparts stood there towers rose high in air
And here through seven wide portals rushd the war

There with soft step the fair Alcmena trod
Who bore Alcides to the thundering god
And Megara who charmd the son of Jove
And softend his stern soul to tender love

Sullen and sour with discontented mien
Jocasta frownd the incestuous Theban queen
With her own son she joind in nuptial bands
Though fathers blood imbrued his murderous hands
The gods and men the dire offence detest
The gods with all their furies rend his breast
In lofty Thebes he wore the imperial crown
A pompous wretch accursed upon a throne
The wife selfmurderd from a beam depends
And her foul soul to blackest hell descends
Thence to her son the choicest plagues she brings
And the fiends haunt him with a thousand stings

And now the beauteous Chloris I descry
A lovely shade Amphions youngest joy
With gifts unnumberd Neleus sought her arms
Nor paid too dearly for unequalld charms
Great in Orchomenos in Pylos great
He swayd the sceptre with imperial state
Three gallant sons the joyful monarch told
Sage Nestor Periclimenus the bold
And Chromius last but of the softer race
One nymph alone a myracle of grace
Kings on their thrones for lovely Pero burn
The sire denies and kings rejected mourn
To him alone the beauteous prize he yields
Whose arm should ravish from Phylacian fields
The herds of Iphyclus detaind in wrong
Wild furious herds unconquerably strong
This dares a seer but nought the seer prevails
In beautys cause illustriously he fails
Twelve moons the foe the captive youth detains
In painful dungeons and coercive chains
The foe at last from durance where he lay
His heart revering give him back to day
Won by prophetic knowledge to fulfil
The steadfast purpose of the Almighty will

With graceful port advancing now I spied
Leda the fair the godlike Tyndars bride
Hence Pollux sprung who wields the furious sway
The deathful gauntlet matchless in the fray
And Castor glorious on the embattled plain
Curbs the proud steeds reluctant to the rein
By turns they visit this ethereal sky
And live alternate and alternate die
In hell beneath on earth in heaven above
Reign the twingods the favourite sons of Jove

There Ephimedia trod the gloomy plain
Who charmd the monarch of the boundless main
Hence Ephialtes hence stern Otus sprung
More fierce than giants more than giants strong
The earth oerburdend groand beneath their weight
None but Orion eer surpassed their height
The wondrous youths had scarce nine winters told
When high in air tremendous to behold
Nine ells aloft they reard their towering head
And full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread
Proud of their strength and more than mortal size
The gods they challenge and affect the skies
Heaved on Olympus tottering Ossa stood
On Ossa Pelion nods with all his wood
Such were they youths I had they to manhood grown
Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne
But ere the harvest of the beard began
To bristle on the chin and promise man
His shafts Apollo aimd at once they sound
And stretch the giant monsters oer the ground

There mournful Phaedra with sad Procris moves
Both beauteous shades both hapless in their loves
And near them walkd with solemn pace and slow
Sad Adriadne partner of their woe
The royal Minos Ariadne bred
She Theseus loved from Crete with Theseus fled
Swift to the Dian isle the hero flies
And towards his Athens bears the lovely prize
There Bacchus with fierce rage Diana fires
The goddess aims her shaft the nymph expires

There Clymene and Mera I behold
There Eriphyle weeps who loosely sold
Her lord her honour for the lust of gold
But should I all recount the night would fail
Unequal to the melancholy tale
And allcomposing rest my nature craves
Here in the court or yonder on the waves
In you I trust and in the heavenly powers
To land Ulysses on his native shores

He ceased but left so charming on their ear
His voice that listening still they seemd to hear
Till rising up Arete silence broke
Stretchd out her snowy hand and thus she spoke

What wondrous man heaven sends us in our guest
Through all his woes the hero shines confessd
His comely port his ample frame express
A manly air majestic in distress
He as my guest is my peculiar care
You share the pleasure then in bounty share
To worth in misery a reverence pay
And with a generous hand reward his stay
For since kind heaven with wealth our realm has blessd
Give it to heaven by aiding the distressd

Then sage Echeneus whose grave reverend brow
The hand of time had silvered oer with snow
Mature in wisdom rose Your words he cries
Demand obedience for your words are wise
But let our king direct the glorious way
To generous acts our part is to obey

While life informs these limbs the king replied
Well to deserve be all my cares employed
But here this night the royal guest detain
Till the sun flames along the ethereal plain
Be it my task to send with ample stores
The stranger from our hospitable shores
Tread you my steps Tis mine to lead the race
The first in glory as the first in place

To whom the prince This night with joy I stay
O monarch great in virtue as in sway
If thou the circling year my stay control
To raise a bounty noble as thy soul
The circling year I wait with ampler stores
And fitter pomp to hail my native shores
Then by my realms due homage would be paid
For wealthy kings are loyally obeyed

O king for such thou art and sure thy blood
Through veins he cried of royal fathers flowd
Unlike those vagrants who on falsehood live
Skilld in smooth tales and artful to deceive
Thy better soul abhors the liars part
Wise is thy voice and noble is thy heart
Thy words like music every breast control
Steal through the ear and win upon the soul
soft as some song divine thy story flows
Nor better could the Muse record thy woes

But say upon the dark and dismal coast
Sawst thou the worthies of the Grecian host
The godlike leaders who in battle slain
Fell before Troy and nobly pressd the plain
And lo a length of night behind remains
The evening stars still mount the ethereal plains
Thy tale with raptures I could hear thee tell
Thy woes on earth the wondrous scenes in hell
Till in the vault of heaven the stars decay
And the sky reddens with the rising day

O worthy of the power the gods assignd
Ulysses thus replies a king in mind
Since yet the early hour of night allows
Time for discourse and time for soft repose
If scenes of misery can entertain
Woes I unfold of woes a dismal train
Prepare to heir of murder and of blood
Of godlike heroes who uninjured stood
Amidst a war of spears in foreign lands
Yet bled at home and bled by female hands

Now summond Proserpine to hells black hall
The heroine shades they vanishd at her call
When lo advanced the forms of heroes slain
By stern AEgysthus a majestic train
And high above the rest Atrides pressd the plain
He quaffd the gore and straight his soldier knew
And from his eyes pourd down the tender dew
His arms he stretchd his arms the touch deceive
Nor in the fond embrace embraces give
His substance vanishd and his strength decayd
Now all Atrides is an empty shade

Moved at the sight I for a apace resignd
To soft affliction all my manly mind
At last with tears O what relentless doom
Imperial phantom bowd thee to the tomb
Say while the sea and while the tempest raves
Has Fate oppressd thee in the roaring waves
Or nobly seized thee in the dire alarms
Of war and slaughter and the clash of arms

The ghost returns O chief of human kind
For active courage and a patient mind
Nor while the sea nor while the tempest raves
Has Fate oppressd me on the roaring waves
Nor nobly seized me in the dire alarms
Of war and slaughter and the clash of arms
Stabbd by a murderous hand Atrides died
A foul adulterer and a faithless bride
Een in my mirth and at the friendly feast
Oer the full bowl the traitor stabbd his guest
Thus by the gory arm of slaughter falls
The stately ox and bleeds within the stalls
But not with me the direful murder ends
These these expired their crime they were my friends
Thick as the boars which some luxurious lord
Kills for the feast to crown the nuptial board
When war has thunderd with its loudest storms
Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms
In duel met her on the listed ground
When hand to hand they wound return for wound
But never have the eyes astonishd viewd
So vile a deed so dire a scene of blood
Een in the flow of joy when now the bowl
Glows in our veins and opens every soul
We groan we faint with blood the doom is dyed
And oer the pavement floats the dreadful tide
Her breast all gore with lamentable cries
The bleeding innocent Cassandra dies
Then though pale death froze cold in every vein
My sword I strive to wield but strive in vain
Nor did my traitress wife these eyelids close
Or decently in death my limbs compose
O woman woman when to ill thy mind
Is bent all hell contains no fouler fiend
And such was mine who basely plunged her sword
Through the fond bosom where she reignd adored
Alas I hoped the toils of war oercome
To meet soft quiet and repose at home
Delusive hope O wife thy deeds disgrace
The perjured sex and blacken all the race
And should posterity one virtuous find
Name Clytemnestra they will curse the kind

Oh injured shade I cried what mighty woes
To thy imperial race from woman rose
By woman here thou treadst this mournful strand
And Greece by woman lies a desert land

Warnd by my ills beware the shade replies
Nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise
When earnest to explore thy secret breast
Unfold some trifle but conceal the rest
But in thy consort cease to fear a foe
For thee she feels sincerity of woe
When Troy first bled beneath the Grecian arms
She shone unrivalld with a blaze of charms
Thy infant son her fragrant bosom pressd
Hung at her knee or wantond at her breast
But now the years a numerous train have ran
The blooming boy is ripend into man
Thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire
The sire shall bless his son the son his sire
But my Orestes never met these eyes
Without one look the murderd father dies
Then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn
Een to thy queen disguised unknown return
For since of womankind so few are just
Think all are false nor een the faithful trust

But say resides my son in royal port
In rich Orchomenos or Spartas court
Or say in Pyle for yet he views the light
Nor glides a phantom through the realms of night

Then I Thy suit is vain nor can I say
If yet he breathes in realms of cheerful day
Or pale or wan beholds these nether skies
Truth I revere for wisdom never lies

Thus in a tide of tears our sorrows flow
And add new horror to the realms of woe
Till side by side along the dreary coast
Advanced Achilles and Patroclus ghost
A friendly pair near these the Pylian strayd
And towering Ajax an illustrious shade
War was his joy and pleased with loud alarms
None but Pelides brighter shone in arms

Through the thick gloom his friend Achilles knew
And as he speaks the tears descend in dew

Comest thou alive to view the Stygian bounds
Where the wan spectres walk eternal rounds
Nor fearst the dark and dismal waste to tread
Throngd with pale ghosts familiar with the dead

To whom with sighs I pass these dreadful gates
To seek the Theban and consult the Fates
For still distressd I rove from coast to coast
Lost to my friends and to my country lost
But sure the eye of Time beholds no name
So blessd as thine in all the rolls of fame
Alive we haild thee with our guardian gods
And dead thou rulest a king in these abodes

Talk not of ruling in this dolorous gloom
Nor think vain words he cried can ease my doom
Rather Id choose laboriously to bear
A weight of woes and breathe the vital air
A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread
Than reign the sceptred monarch of the dead
But say if in my steps my son proceeds
And emulates his godlike fathers deeds
If at the clash of arms and shout of foes
Swells his bold heart his bosom nobly glows
Say if my sire the reverend Peleus reigns
Great in his Phthia and his throne maintains
Or weak and old my youthful arm demands
To fix the sceptre steadfast in his hands
O might the lamp of life rekindled burn
And death release me from the silent urn
This arm that thunderd oer the Phrygian plain
And swelld the ground with mountains of the slain
Should vindicate my injured fathers fame
Crush the proud rebel and assert his claim

Illustrious shade I cried of Peleus fates
No circumstance the voice of Fame relates
But hear with pleased attention the renown
The wars and wisdom of thy gallant son
With me from Scyros to the field of fame
Radiant in arms the blooming hero came
When Greece assembled all her hundred states
To ripen counsels and decide debates
Heavens how he charmd us with a flow of sense
And won the heart with manly eloquence
He first was seen of all the peers to rise
The third in wisdom where they all were wise
But when to try the fortune of the day
Host moved toward host in terrible array
Before the van impatient for the fight
With martial port he strode and stern delight
Heaps strewd on heaps beneath his falchion groand
And monuments of dead deformd the ground
The time would fail should I in order tell
What foes were vanquishd and what numbers fell
How lost through love Eurypylus was slain
And round him bled his bold Cetaean train
To Troy no hero came of nobler line
Or if of nobler Memnon it was thine

When Ilion in the horse received her doom
And unseen armies ambushd in its womb
Greece gave her latent warriors to my care
Twas mine on Troy to pour the imprisond war
Then when the boldest bosom beat with fear
When the stern eyes of heroes droppd a tear
Fierce in his look his ardent valour glowd
Flushd in his cheek or sallied in his blood
Indignant in the dark recess he stands
Pants for the battle and the war demands
His voice breathed death and with a martial air
He graspd his sword and shook his glittering spear
And when the gods our arms with conquest crownd
When Troys proud bulwarks smoked upon the ground
Greece to reward her soldiers gallant toils
Heapd high his navy with unnumberd spoils

Thus great in glory from the din of war
Safe he returnd without one hostile scar
Though spears in iron tempests raind around
Yet innocent they playd and guiltless of a wound

While yet I spoke the shade with transport glowd
Rose in his majesty and nobler trod
With haughty stalk he sought the distant glades
Of warrior kings and joind the illustrious shades

Now without number ghost by ghost arose
All wailing with unutterable woes
Alone apart in discontented mood
A gloomy shade the sullen Ajax stood
For ever sad with proud disdain he pined
And the lost arms for ever stung his mind
Though to the contest Thetis gave the laws
And Pallas by the Trojans judged the cause
O why was I victorious in the strife
O dear bought honour with so brave a life
With him the strength of war the soldiers pride
Our second hope to great Achilles died
Touchd at the sight from tears I scarce refrain
And tender sorrow thrills in every vein
Pensive and sad I stand at length accost
With accents mild the inexorable ghost
Still burns thy rage and can brave souls resent
Een after death Relent great shade relent
Perish those arms which by the gods decree
Accursed our army with the loss of thee
With thee we fall Greece wept thy hapless fates
And shook astonishd through her hundred states
Not more when great Achilles pressd the ground
And breathed his manly spirit through the wound
O deem thy fall not owed to mans decree
Jove hated Greece and punishd Greece in thee
Turn then oh peaceful turn thy wrath control
And calm the raging tempest of thy soul

While yet I speak the shade disdains to stay
In silence turns and sullen stalks away

Touchd at his sour retreat through deepest night
Through hells black bounds I had pursued his flight
And forced the stubborn spectre to reply
But wondrous visions drew my curious eye
High on a throne tremendous to behold
Stern Minos waves a mace of burnishd gold
Around ten thousand thousand spectres stand
Through the wide dome of Dis a trembling band
Still as they plead the fatal lots he rolls
Absolves the just and dooms the guilty souls

The huge Orion of portentous size
Swift through the gloom a gianthunter flies
A ponderous mace of brass with direful sway
Aloft he whirls to crush the savage prey
Stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell
Now grisly forms shoot oer the lawns of hell

There Tityus large and long in fetters bound
Oerspreads nine acres of infernal ground
Two ravenous vultures furious for their food
Scream oer the fiend and riot in his blood
Incessant gore the liver in his breast
The immortal liver grows and gives the immortal feast
For as oer Panopes enamelld plains
Latona journeyd to the Pythian fanes
With haughty love the audacious monster strove
To force the goddess and to rival Jove

There Tantalus along the Stygian bounds
Pours out deep groans with groans all hell resounds
Een in the circling floods refreshment craves
And pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves
When to the water he his lip applies
Back from his lip the treacherous water flies
Above beneath around his hapless head
Trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread
There figs skydyed a purple hue disclose
Green looks the olive the pomegranate glows
There dangling pears exalting scents unfold
And yellow apples ripen into gold
The fruit he strives to seize but blasts arise
Toss it on high and whirl it to the skies

I turnd my eye and as I turnd surveyd
A mournful vision the Sisyphian shade
With many a weary step and many a groan
Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone
The huge round stone resulting with a bound
Thunders impetuous down and smokes along the ground
Again the restless orb his toil renews
Dust mounts in clouds and sweat descends in dews

Now I the strength of Hercules behold
A towering spectre of gigantic mould
A shadowy form for high in heavens abodes
Himself resides a god among the gods
There in the bright assemblies of the skies
He nectar quaffs and Hebe crowns his joys
Here hovering ghosts like fowl his shade surround
And clang their pinions with terrific sound
Gloomy as night he stands in act to throw
The aerial arrow from the twanging bow
Around his breast a wondrous zone is rolld
Where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold
There sullen lions sternly seem to roar
The bear to growl to foam the tusky boar
There war and havoc and destruction stood
And vengeful murder red with human blood
Thus terribly adorned the figures shine
Inimitably wrought with skill divine
The mighty good advanced with awful look
And turning his grim visage sternly spoke

O exercise in grief by arts refined
O taught to bear the wrongs of base mankind
Such such was I Still tossd from care to care
While in your world I drew the vital air
Een I who from the Lord of Thunders rose
Bore toils and dangers and a weight of woes
To a base monarch still a slave confined
The hardest bondage to a generous mind
Down to these worlds I trod the dismal way
And draggd the threemouthd dog to upper day
Een hell I conquerd through the friendly aid
Of Maias offspring and the martial maid

Thus he nor deignd for our reply to stay
But turning stalkd with giantstrides away

Curious to view the kings of ancient days
The mighty dead that live in endless praise
Resolved I stand and haply had surveyd
The godlike Theseus and Pirithous shade
But swarms of spectres rose from deepest hell
With bloodless visage and with hideous yell
They scream they shriek and groans and dismal sounds
Stun my scared ears and pierce hells utmost bounds
No more my heart the dismal din sustains
And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins
Lest Gorgon rising from the infernal lakes
With horrors armd and curls of hissing snakes
Should fix me stiffend at the monstrous sight
A stony image in eternal night
Straight from the direful coast to purer air
I speed my flight and to my mates repair
My mates ascend the ship they strike their oars
The mountains lessen and retreat the shores
Swift oer the waves we fly the freshening gales
Sing through the shrouds and stretch the swelling sails



BOOK XII

ARGUMENT

THE SIRENE SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS

He relates how after his return from the shades he was sent by
Circe on his voyage by the coast of the Sirens and by the strait
of Scylla and Charybdis the manner in which he escaped those
dangers how being cast on the island Trinacria his companions
destroyed the oxen of the Sun the vengeance that followed how
all perished by shipwreck except himself who swimming on the
mast of the ship arrived on the island of Calypso With which his
narration concludes



Thus oer the rolling surge the vessel flies
Till from the waves the AEaean hills arise
Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bowers
Here keeps here revels with the dancing Hours
Here Phoebus rising in the ethereal way
Through heavens bright portals pours the beamy day
At once we fix our halsers on the land
At once descend and press the desert sand
There worn and wasted lose our cares in sleep
To the hoarse murmurs of the rolling deep

Soon as the morn restored the day we paid
Sepulchral honours to Elpenors shade
Now by the axe the rushing forest bends
And the huge pile along the shore ascends
Around we stand a melancholy train
And a loud groan reechoes from the main
Fierce oer the pyre by fanning breezes spread
The hungry flames devour the silent dead
A rising tomb the silent dead to grace
Fast by the roarings of the main we place
The rising tomb a lofty column bore
And high above it rose the tapering oar

Meantime the goddess our return surveyd
From the pale ghosts and hells tremendous shade
Swift she descends a train of nymphs divine
Bear the rich viands and the generous wine
In act to speak the power of magic stands
And graceful thus accosts the listening bands

O sons of woe decreed by adverse fates
Alive to pass through hells eternal gates
All soon or late are doomd that path to tread
More wretched you twice numberd with the dead
This day adjourn your cares exalt your souls
Indulge the taste and drain the sparkling bowls
And when the morn unveils her saffron ray
Spread your broad sails and plough the liquid way
Lo I this night your faithful guide explain
Your woes by land your dangers on the main

The goddess spoke In feasts we waste the day
Till Phoebus downward plunged his burning ray
Then sable night ascends and balmy rest
Seals every eye and calms the troubled breast
Then curious she commands me to relate
The dreadful scenes of Plutos dreary state
She sat in silence while the tale I tell
The wondrous visions and the laws of hell

Then thus The lot of man the gods dispose
These ills are past now hear thy future woes
O prince attend some favouring power be kind
And print the important story on thy mind

Next where the Sirens dwells you plough the seas
Their song is death and makes destruction please
Unblest the man whom music wins to stay
Nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay
No more that wretch shall view the joys of life
His blooming offspring or his beauteous wife
In verdant meads they sport and wide around
Lie human bones that whiten all the ground
The ground polluted floats with human gore
And human carnage taints the dreadful shore
Fly swift the dangerous coast let every ear
Be stoppd against the song tis death to hear
Firm to the mast with chains thyself be bound
Nor trust thy virtue to the enchanting sound
If mad with transport freedom thou demand
Be every fetter straind and added band to band

These seas oerpassd be wise but I refrain
To mark distinct thy voyage oer the main
New horrors rise let prudence be thy guide
And guard thy various passage through the tide

High oer the main two rocks exalt their brow
The boiling billows thundering roll below
Through the vast waves the dreadful wonders move
Hence named Erratic by the gods above
No bird of air no dove of swiftest wing
That bears ambrosia to the ethereal king
Shuns the dire rocks in vain she cuts the skies
The dire rocks meet and crush her as she flies
Not the fleet bark when prosperous breezes play
Ploughs oer that roaring surge its desperate way
Oerwhelmd it sinks while round a smoke expires
And the waves flashing seem to burn with fires
Scarce the famed Argo passd these raging floods
The sacred Argo filld with demigods
Een she had sunk but Joves imperial bride
Wingd her fleet sail and pushd her oer the tide

High in the air the rock its summit shrouds
In brooding tempests and in rolling clouds
Loud storms around and mists eternal rise
Beat its bleak brow and intercept the skies
When all the broad expansion bright with day
Glows with the autumnal or the summer ray
The summer and the autumn glow in vain
The sky for ever lowers for ever clouds remain
Impervious to the step of man it stands
Though borne by twenty feet though armd with twenty hands
Smooth as the polish of the mirror rise
The slippery sides and shoot into the skies
Full in the centre of this rock displayd
A yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade
Nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow
Sent with full force could reach the depth below
Wide to the west the horrid gulf extends
And the dire passage down to hell descends
O fly the dreadful sight expand thy sails
Ply the strong oar and catch the nimble gales
Here Scylla bellows from the dire abodes
Tremendous pest abhorrd by man and gods
Hideous her voice and with less terrors roar
The whelps of lions in the midnight hour
Twelve feet deformd and foul the fiend dispreads
Six horrid necks she rears and six terrific heads
Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth
Jaggy they stand the gaping den of death
Her parts obscene the raging billows hide
Her bosom terribly oerlooks the tide
When stung with hunger she embroils the flood
The seadog and the dolphin are her food
She makes the huge leviathan her prey
And all the monsters of the watery way
The swiftest racer of the azure plain
Here fills her sails and spreads her oars in vain
Fell Scylla rises in her fury roars
At once six mouths expands at once six men devours

Close by a rock of less enormous height
Breaks the wild waves and forms a dangerous strait
Full on its crown a figs green branches rise
And shoot a leafy forest to the skies
Beneath Charybdis holds her boisterous reign
Midst roaring whirlpools and absorbs the main
Thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside
Thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide
Oh if thy vessel plough the direful waves
When seas retreating roar within her caves
Ye perish all though he who rules the main
Lends his strong aid his aid he lends in vain
Ah shun the horrid gulf by Scylla fly
Tis better six to lose than all to die

I then O nymph propitious to my prayer
Goddess divine my guardian power declare
Is the foul fiend from human vengeance freed
Or if I rise in arms can Scylla bleed

Then she O worn by toils O broke in fight
Still are new toils and war thy dire delight
Will martial flames for ever fire thy mind
And never never be to Heaven resignd
How vain thy efforts to avenge the wrong
Deathless the pest impenetrably strong
Furious and fell tremendous to behold
Een with a look she withers all the bold
She mocks the weak attempts of human might
Oh fly her rage thy conquest is thy flight
If but to seize thy arms thou make delay
Again thy fury vindicates her prey
Her six mouths yawn and six are snatchd away
From her foul wound Crataeis gave to air
This dreadful pest To her direct thy prayer
To curb the monster in her dire abodes
And guard thee through the tumult of the floods
Thence to Trinacrias shore you bend your way
Where graze thy herds illustrious source of day
Seven herds seven flocks enrich the sacred plains
Each herd each flock full fifty heads contains
The wondrous kind a length of age survey
By breed increase not nor by death decay
Two sister goddesses possess the plain
The constant guardian of the woolly train
Lampetie fair and Phaethusa young
From Phoebus and the bright Neaea sprung
Here watchful oer the flocks in shady bowers
And flowery meads they waste the joyous hours
Rob not the gods and so propitious gales
Attend thy voyage and impel thy sails
But if thy impious hands the flocks destroy
The gods the gods avenge it and ye die
Tis thine alone thy friends and navy lost
Through tedious toils to view thy native coast

She ceased and now arose the morning ray
Swift to her dome the goddess held her way
Then to my mates I measured back the plain
Climbd the tall bark and rushd into the main
Then bending to the stroke their oars they drew
To their broad breasts and swift the galley flew
Up sprung a brisker breeze with freshening gales
The friendly goddess stretchd the swelling sails
We drop our oars at ease the pilot guides
The vessel light along the level glides
When rising sad and slow with pensive look
Thus to the melancholy train I spoke

O friends oh ever partners of my woes
Attend while I what Heaven foredooms disclose
Hear all Fate hangs oer all on you it lies
To live or perish to be safe be wise

In flowery meads the sportive Sirens play
Touch the soft lyre and tune the vocal lay
Me me alone with fetters firmly bound
The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound
Hear and obey if freedom I demand
Be every fetter straind be added band to band

While yet I speak the winged galley flies
And lo the Siren shores like mists arise
Sunk were at once the winds the air above
And waves below at once forgot to move
Some demon calmd the air and smoothd the deep
Hushd the loud winds and charmd the waves to sleep
Now every sail we furl each oar we ply
Lashd by the stroke the frothy waters fly
The ductile wax with busy hands I mould
And cleft in fragments and the fragments rolld
The aerial region now grew warm with day
The wax dissolved beneath the burning ray
Then every ear I barrd against the strain
And from access of frenzy lockd the brain
Now round the masts my mates the fetters rolld
And bound me limb by limb with fold on fold
Then bending to the stroke the active train
Plunge all at once their oars and cleave the main

While to the shore the rapid vessel flies
Our swift approach the Siren choir descries
Celestial music warbles from their tongue
And thus the sweet deluders tune the song

Oh stay O pride of Greece Ulysses stay
Oh cease thy course and listen to our lay
Blest is the man ordaind our voice to hear
The song instructs the soul and charms the ear
Approach thy soul shall into raptures rise
Approach and learn new wisdom from the wise
We know whateer the kings of mighty name
Achieved at Ilion in the field of fame
Whateer beneath the suns bright journey lies
Oh stay and learn new wisdom from the wise

Thus the sweet charmers warbled oer the main
My soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain
I give the sign and struggle to be free
Swift row my mates and shoot along the sea
New chains they add and rapid urge the way
Till dying off the distant sounds decay
Then scudding swiftly from the dangerous ground
The deafend ear unlockd the chains unbound

Now all at once tremendous scenes unfold
Thunderd the deeps the smoky billows rolld
Tumultuous waves embroil the bellowing flood
All trembling deafend and aghast we stood
No more the vessel ploughd the dreadful wave
Fear seized the mighty and unnerved the brave
Each droppd his oar but swift from man to man
With looks serene I turnd and thus began
O friends O often tried in adverse storms
With ills familiar in more dreadful forms
Deep in the dire Cyclopean den you lay
Yet safe returndUlysses led the way
Learn courage hence and in my care confide
Lo still the same Ulysses is your guide
Attend my words your oars incessant ply
Strain every nerve and bid the vessel fly
If from yon jostling rocks and wavy war
Jove safety grants he grants it to your care
And thou whose guiding hand directs our way
Pilot attentive listen and obey
Bear wide thy course nor plough those angry waves
Where rolls yon smoke yon tumbling ocean raves
Steer by the higher rock lest whirld around
We sink beneath the circling eddy drownd
While yet I speak at once their oars they seize
Stretch to the stroke and brush the working seas
Cautious the name of Scylla I suppressd
That dreadful sound had chilld the boldest breast

Meantime forgetful of the voice divine
All dreadful bright my limbs in armour shine
High on the deck I take my dangerous stand
Two glittering javelins lighten in my hand
Prepared to whirl the whizzing spear I stay
Till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey
Around the dungeon studious to behold
The hideous pest my labouring eyes I rolld
In vain the dismal dungeon dark as night
Veils the dire monster and confounds the sight

Now through the rocks appalld with deep dismay
We bend our course and stem the desperate way
Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms
And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms
When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves
The rough rock roars tumultuous boil the waves
They toss they foam a wild confusion raise
Like waters bubbling oer the fiery blaze
Eternal mists obscure the aerial plain
And high above the rock she spouts the main
When in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides
She drains the ocean with the refluent tides
The rock rebellows with a thundering sound
Deep wondrous deep below appears the ground

Struck with despair with trembling hearts we viewd
The yawning dungeon and the tumbling flood
When lo fierce Scylla stoopd to seize her prey
Stretchd her dire jaws and swept six men away
Chiefs of renown loudechoing shrieks arise
I turn and view them quivering in the skies
They call and aid with outstretchd arms implore
In vain they call those arms are stretchd no more
As from some rock that overhangs the flood
The silent fisher casts the insidious food
With fraudful care he waits the finny prize
And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies
So the foul monster lifts her prey on high
So pant the wretches struggling in the sky
In the wide dungeon she devours her food
And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood
Worn as I am with griefs with care decayd
Never I never scene so dire surveyd
My shivering blood congeald forgot to flow
Aghast I stood a monument of woe

Now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies
And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies
To Sols bright isle our voyage we pursue
And now the glittering mountains rise to view
There sacred to the radiant god of day
Graze the fair herds the flocks promiscuous stray
Then suddenly was heard along the main
To low the ox to blest the woolly train
Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound conveyd
The words of Circe and the Theban shade
Warnd by their awful voice these shores to shun
With cautious fears oppressd I thus begun

O friends O ever exorcised in care
Hear Heavens commands and reverence what ye hear
To fly these shores the prescient Theban shade
And Circe warn Oh be their voice obeyd
Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes
Fly these dire regions and revere the gods

While yet I spoke a sudden sorrow ran
Through every breast and spread from man to man
Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began

O cruel thou some Fury sure has steeld
That stubborn soul by toil untaught to yield
From sleep debarrd we sink from woes to woes
And cruel enviest thou a short repose
Still must we restless rove new seas explore
The sun descending and so near the shore
And lo the night begins her groomy reign
And doubles all the terrors of the main
Oft in the dead of night loud winds rise
Lash the wild surge and bluster in the skies
Oh should the fierce southwest his rage display
And toss with rising storms the watery way
Though gods descend from heavens aerial plain
To lend us aid the gods descend in vain
Then while the night displays her awful shade
Sweet time of slumber be the night obey
Haste ye to land and when the morning ray
Sheds her bright beam pursue the destined way
A sudden joy in every bosom rose
So willd some demon minister of woes

To whom with grief O swift to be undone
Constraind I act what wisdom bids me shun
But yonder herbs and yonder flocks forbear
Attest the heavens and call the gods to hear
Content an innocent repast display
By Circe given and fly the dangerous prey

Thus I and while to shore the vessel flies
With hands uplifted they attest the skies
Then where a fountains gurgling waters play
They rush to land and end in feasts the day
They feed they quaff and now their hunger fled
Sigh for their friends devourd and mourn the dead
Nor cease the tears till each in slumber shares
A sweet forgetfulness of human cares
Now far the night advanced her gloomy reign
And setting stars rolld down the azure plain
When at the voice of Jove wild whirlwinds rise
And clouds and double darkness veil the skies
The moon the stars the bright ethereal host
Seem as extinct and all their splendours lost
The furious tempest roars with dreadful sound
Air thunders rolls the ocean groans the ground
All night it raged when morning rose to land
We hauld our bark and moord it on the strand
Where in a beauteous grottos cool recess
Dance the green Nerolds of the neighbouring seas

There while the wild winds whistled oer the main
Thus careful I addressd the listening train

O friends be wise nor dare the flocks destroy
Of these fair pastures if ye touch ye die
Warnd by the high command of Heaven be awed
Holy the flocks and dreadful is the god
That god who spreads the radiant beams of light
And views wide earth and heavens unmeasured height

And now the moon had run her monthly round
The southeast blustering with a dreadful sound
Unhurt the beeves untouchd the woolly train
Low through the grove or touch the flowery plain
Then faild our food then fish we make our prey
Or fowl that screaming haunt the watery way
Till now from sea or flood no succour found
Famine and meagre want besieged us round
Pensive and pale from grove to grove I strayd
From the loud storms to find a sylvan shade
There oer my hands the living wave I pour
And Heaven and Heavens immortal thrones implore
To calm the roarings of the stormy main
And guide me peaceful to my realms again
Then oer my eyes the gods soft slumbers shed
While thus Eurylochus arising said

O friends a thousand ways frail mortals lead
To the cold tomb and dreadful all to tread
But dreadful most when by a slow decay
Pale hunger wastes the manly strength away
Why cease ye then to implore the powers above
And offer hecatombs to thundering Jove
Why seize ye not yon beeves and fleecy prey
Arise unanimous arise and slay
And if the gods ordain a safe return
To Phoebus shrines shall rise and altars burn
But should the powers that oer mankind preside
Decree to plunge us in the whelming tide
Better to rush at once to shades below
Than linger life away and nourish woe

Thus he the beeves around securely stray
When swift to ruin they invade the prey
They seize they killbut for the rite divine
The barley faild and for libations wine
Swift from the oak they strip the shady pride
And verdant leaves the flowery cake supplied

With prayer they now address the ethereal train
Slay the selected beeves and flay the slain
The thighs with fat involved divide with art
Strewd oer with morsels cut from every part
Water instead of wine is brought in urns
And pourd profanely as the victim burns
The thighs thus offerd and the entrails dressd
They roast the fragments and prepare the feast

Twas then soft slumber fled my troubled brain
Back to the bark I speed along the main
When lo an odour from the feast exhales
Spreads oer the coast and scents the tainted gales
A chilly fear congeald my vital blood
And thus obtesting Heaven I mournd aloud

O sire of men and gods immortal Jove
O all ye blissful powers that reign above
Why were my cares beguiled in short repose
O fatal slumber paid with lasting woes
A deed so dreadful all the gods alarms
Vengeance is on the wing and Heaven in arms

Meantime Lampetie mounts the aerial way
And kindles into rage the god of day

Vengeance ye powers he cries and then whose hand
Aims the red bolt and hurls the writhen brand
Slain are those herds which I with pride survey
When through the ports of heaven I pour the day
Or deep in ocean plunge the burning ray
Vengeance ye gods or I the skies forego
And bear the lamp of heaven to shades below

To whom the thundering Power O source of day
Whose radiant lamp adorns the azure way
Still may thy beams through heavens bright portal rise
The joy of earth the glory of the skies
Lo my red arm I bare my thunders guide
To dash the offenders in the whelming tide

To fair Calypso from the bright abodes
Hermes conveyd these counsels of the gods

Meantime from man to man my tongue exclaims
My wrath is kindled and my soul in flames
In vain I view performd the direful deed
Beeves slain in heaps along the ocean bleed

Now heaven gave signs of wrath along the ground
Crept the raw hides and with a bellowing sound
Roard the dead limbs the burning entrails groand
Six guilty days my wretched mates employ
In impious feasting and unhallowed joy
The seventh arose and now the sire of gods
Reind the rough storms and calmd the tossing floods
With speed the bark we climb the spacious sails
Loosed from the yards invite the impelling gales
Past sight of shore along the surge we bound
And all above is sky and ocean all around
When lo a murky cloud the thunderer forms
Full oer our heads and blackens heaven with storms
Night dwells oer all the deep and now outflies
The gloomy west and whistles in the skies
The mountainbillows roar the furious blast
Howls oer the shroud and rends it from the mast
The mast gives way and crackling as it bends
Tears up the deck then all at once descends
The pilot by the tumbling ruin slain
Dashd from the helm falls headlong in the main
Then Jove in anger bids his thunders roll
And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole
Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims
Red with uncommon wrath and wrappd in flames
Full on the bark it fell now high now low
Tossd and retossd it reeld beneath the blow
At once into the main the crew it shook
Sulphurous odours rose and smouldering smoke
Like fowl that haunt the floods they sink they rise
Now lost now seen with shrieks and dreadful cries
And strive to gain the bark but Jove denies
Firm at the helm I stand when fierce the main
Rushd with dire noise and dashd the sides in twain
Again impetuous drove the furious blast
Snappd the strong helm and bore to sea the mast
Firm to the mast with cords the helm I bind
And ride aloft to Providence resignd
Through tumbling billows and a war of wind
Now sunk the west and now a southern breeze
More dreadful than the tempest lashd the seas
For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves
And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves
All night I drove and at the dawn of day
Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way
Just when the sea within her gulfs subsides
And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides
Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound
The lofty figtree seized and clung around
So to the beam the bat tenacious clings
And pendent round it clasps his leather wings
High in the air the tree its boughs displayd
And oer the dungeon cast a dreadful shade
All unsustaind between the wave and sky
Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly
What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar
To take repast and stills the wordy war
Charybdis rumbling from her inmost caves
The mast refunded on her refluent waves
Swift from the tree the floating mass to gain
Sudden I droppd amidst the flashing main
Once more undaunted on the ruin rode
And oard with labouring arms along the flood
Unseen I passd by Scyllas dire abodes
So Jove decreed dread sire of men and gods
Then nine long days I plowd the calmer seas
Heaved by the surge and wafted by the breeze
Weary and wet the Ogygian shores I gain
When the tenth sun descended to the main
There in Calypsos everfragrant bowers
Refreshd I lay and joy beguiled the hours
My following fates to thee O king are known
And the bright partner of thy royal throne
Enough in misery can words avail
And what so tedious as a twicetold tale



BOOK XIII

ARGUMENT

THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA

Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete and embarks in the
evening Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca where the
sailors as Ulysses is yet sleeping lay him on the shore with all
his treasures On their return Neptune changes their ship into a
rock In the meantime Ulysses awaking knows not his native
Ithaca by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast around him He
breaks into loud lamentations till the goddess appearing to him
in the form of a shepherd discovers the country to him and
points out the particular places He then tells a feigned story of
his adventures upon which she manifests herself and they consult
together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors To
conceal his return and disguise his person the more effectually
she changes him into the figure of an old beggar



He ceased but left so pleasing on their ear
His voice that listening still they seemd to hear
A pause of silence hushd the shady rooms
The grateful conference then the king resumes

Whatever toils the great Ulysses passd
Beneath this happy roof they end at last
No longer now from shore to shore to roam
Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home
But hear me princes whom these walls inclose
For whom my chanter sings and goblet flows
With wine unmixd an honour due to age
To cheer the grave and warm the poets rage
Though labourd gold and many a dazzling vest
Lie heapd already for our godlike guest
Without new treasures let him not remove
Large and expressive of the public love
Each peer a tripod each a vase bestow
A general tribute which the state shall owe

This sentence pleased then all their steps addressd
To separate mansions and retired to rest

Now did the rosyfingerd morn arise
And shed her sacred light along the skies
Down to the haven and the ships in haste
They bore the treasures and in safety placed
The king himself the vases ranged with care
Then bade his followers to the feast prepare
A victim ox beneath the sacred hand
Of great Alcinous falls and stains the sand
To Jove the Eternal power above all powers
Who wings the winds and darkens heaven with showers
The flames ascend till evening they prolong
The rites more sacred made by heavenly song
For in the midst with public honours graced
Thy lyre divine Demodocus was placed
All but Ulysses heard with fixd delight
He sate and eyed the sun and wishd the night
Slow seemd the sun to move the hours to roll
His native home deepimaged in his soul
As the tired ploughman spent with stubborn toil
Whose oxen long have torn the furrowd soil
Sees with delight the suns declining ray
When home with feeble knees he bends his way
To late repast the days hard labour done
So to Ulysses welcome set the sun
Then instant to Alcinous and the rest
The Scherian states he turnd and thus addressd

O thou the first in merit and command
And you the peers and princes of the land
May every joy be yours nor this the least
When due libation shall have crownd the feast
Safe to my home to send your happy guest
Complete are now the bounties you have given
Be all those bounties but confirmd by Heaven
So may I find when all my wanderings cease
My consort blameless and my friends in peace
On you be every bliss and every day
In homefelt joys delighted roll away
Yourselves your wives your longdescending race
May every god enrich with every grace
Sure fixd on virtue may your nation stand
And public evil never touch the land

His words well weighd the general voice approved
Benign and instant his dismission moved
The monarch to Pontonus gave the sign
To fill the goblet high with rosy wine
Great Jove the Father first he cried implore
Then send the stranger to his native shore

The luscious wine the obedient herald brought
Around the mansion flowd the purple draught
Each from his seat to each immortal pours
Whom glory circles in the Olympian bowers
Ulysses sole with air majestic stands
The bowl presenting to Aretes hands
Then thus O queen farewell be still possessd
Of dear remembrance blessing still and blessd
Till age and death shall gently call thee hence
Sure fate of every mortal excellence
Farewell and joys successive ever spring
To thee to thine the people and the king

Thus he then parting prints the sandy shore
To the fair port a herald marchd before
Sent by Alcinous of Aretes train
Three chosen maids attend him to the main
This does a tunic and white vest convey
A various casket that of rich inlay
And bread and wine the third The cheerful mates
Safe in the hollow poop dispose the cates
Upon the deck soft painted robes they spread
With linen coverd for the heros bed
He climbed the lofty stern then gently pressd
The swelling couch and lay composed to rest

Now placed in order the Phaeacian train
Their cables loose and launch into the main
At once they bend and strike their equal oars
And leave the sinking hills and lessening shores
While on the deck the chief in silence lies
And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes
As fiery coursers in the rapid race
Urged by fierce drivers through the dusty space
Toss their high heads and scour along the plain
So mounts the bounding vessel oer the main
Back to the stern the parted billows flow
And the black ocean foams and roars below

Thus with spread sails the winged galley flies
Less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies
Divine Ulysses was her sacred load
A man in wisdom equal to a god
Much danger long and mighty toils he bore
In storms by sea and combats on the shore
All which soft sleep now banishd from his breast
Wrappd in a pleasing deep and deathlike rest

But when the morningstar with early ray
Flamed in the front of heaven and promised day
Like distant clouds the mariner descries
Fair Ithacas emerging hills arise
Far from the town a spacious port appears
Sacred to Phorcys power whose name it bears
Two craggy rocks projecting to the main
The roaring winds tempestuous rage restrain
Within the waves in softer murmurs glide
And ships secure without their halsers ride
High at the head a branching olive grows
And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs
Beneath a gloomy grottos cool recess
Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas
Where bowls and urns were formd of living stone
And massy beams in native marble shone
On which the labours of the nymphs were rolld
Their webs divine of purple mixd with gold
Within the cave the clustering bees attend
Their waxen works or from the roof depend
Perpetual waters oer the pavement glide
Two marble doors unfold on either side
Sacred the south by which the gods descend
But mortals enter at the northern end
Thither they bent and hauld their ship to land
The crooked keel divides the yellow sand
Ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore
And gently placed him on the rocky shore
His treasures next Alcinous gifts they laid
In the wild olives unfrequented shade
Secure from theft then launchd the bark again
Resumed their oars and measured back the main
Nor yet forgot old Oceans dread supreme
The vengeance vowd for eyeless Polypheme
Before the throne of mighty Jove lie stood
And sought the secret counsels of the god

Shall then no more O sire of gods be mine
The rights and honours of a power divine
Scornd een by man and oh severe disgrace
By soft Phaeacians my degenerate race
Against yon destined head in vain I swore
And menaced vengeance ere he reachd his shore
To reach his natal shore was thy decree
Mild I obeyd for who shall war with thee
Behold him landed careless and asleep
From all the eluded dangers of the deep
Lo where he lies amidst a shining store
Of brass rich garments and refulgent ore
And bears triumphant to his native isle
A prize more worth than Ilions noble spoil

To whom the Father of the immortal powers
Who swells the clouds and gladdens earth with showers
Can mighty Neptune thus of man complain
Neptune tremendous oer the boundless main
Revered and awful een in heavens abodes
Ancient and great a god above the gods
If that low race offend thy power divine
Weak daring creatures is not vengeance thine
Go then the guilty at thy will chastise
He said The shaker of the earth replies

This then I doom to fix the gallant ship
A mark of vengeance on the sable deep
To warn the thoughtless selfconfiding train
No more unlicensed thus to brave the main
Full in their port a Shady hill shall rise
If such thy will We will it Jove replies
Een when with transport blackening all the strand
The swarming people hail their ship to land
Fix her for ever a memorial stone
Still let her seem to sail and seem alone
The trembling crowds shall see the sudden shade
Of whelming mountains overhang their head

With that the god whose earthquakes rock the ground
Fierce to Phaeacia crossd the vast profound
Swift as a swallow sweeps the liquid way
The winged pinnace shot along the sea
The god arrests her with a sudden stroke
And roots her down an everlasting rock
Aghast the Scherians stand in deep surprise
All press to speak all question with their eyes
What hands unseen the rapid bark restrain
And yet it swims or seems to swim the main
Thus they unconscious of the deed divine
Till great Alcinous rising ownd the sign

Behold the long predestined day I he cries
O certain faith of ancient prophecies
These ears have heard my royal sire disclose
A dreadful story big with future woes
How moved with wrath that careless we convey
Promiscuous every guest to every bay
Stern Neptune raged and how by his command
Firm rooted in the surge a ship should stand
A monument of wrath and mound on mound
Should hide our walls or whelm beneath the ground

The Fates have followd as declared the seer
Be humbled nations and your monarch hear
No more unlicensed brave the deeps no more
With every stranger pass from shore to shore
On angry Neptune now for mercy call
To his high name let twelve black oxen fall
So may the god reverse his purposed will
Nor oer our city hang the dreadful hill

The monarch spoke they trembled and obeyd
Forth on the sands the victim oxen led
The gathered tribes before the altars stand
And chiefs and rulers a majestic band
The king of ocean all the tribes implore
The blazing altars redden all the shore

Meanwhile Ulysses in his country lay
Released from sleep and round him might survey
The solitary shore and rolling sea
Yet had his mind through tedious absence lost
The dear resemblance of his native coast
Besides Minerva to secure her care
Diffused around a veil of thickened air
For so the gods ordaind to keep unseen
His royal person from his friends and queen
Till the proud suitors for their crimes afford
An ample vengeance to their injured lord

Now all the land another prospect bore
Another port appeard another shore
And longcontinued ways and winding floods
And unknown mountains crownd with unknown woods
Pensive and slow with sudden grief oppressd
The king arose and beat his careful breast
Cast a long look oer all the coast and main
And sought around his native realm in vain
Then with erected eyes stood fixd in woe
And as he spoke the tears began to flow

Ye gods he cried upon what barren coast
In what new region is Ulysses tossd
Possessd by wild barbarians fierce in arms
Or men whose bosom tender pity warms
Where shall this treasure now in safely be
And whither whither its sad owner fly
Ah why did I Alcinous grace implore
Ah why forsake Phaeacias happy shore
Some juster prince perhaps had entertaind
And safe restored me to my native land
Is this the promised longexpected coast
And this the faith Phaeacias rulers boast
O righteous gods of all the great how few
Are just to Heaven and to their promise true
But he the power to whose allseeing eyes
The deeds of men appear without disguise
Tis his alone to avenge the wrongs I bear
For still the oppressd are his peculiar care
To count these presents and from thence to prove
Their faith is mine the rest belongs to Jove

Then on the sands he ranged his wealthy store
The gold the vests the tripods numberd oer
All these he found but still in error lost
Disconsolate he wanders on the coast
Sighs for his country and laments again
To the deaf rocks and hoarseresounding main
When lo the guardian goddess of the wise
Celestial Pallas stood before his eyes
In show a youthful swain of form divine
Who seemd descended from some princely line
A graceful robe her slender body dressd
Around her shoulders flew the waving vest
Her decent hand a shining javelin bore
And painted sandals on her feet she wore
To whom the king Whoeer of human race
Thou art that wanderest in this desert place
With joy to thee as to some god I bend
To thee my treasures and myself commend
O tell a wretch in exile doomd to stray
What air I breathe what country I survey
The fruitful continents extremest bound
Or some fair isle which Neptunes arms surround

From what far clime said she remote from fame
Arrivest thou here a stranger to our name
Thou seest an island not to those unknown
Whose hills are brightend by the rising sun
Nor those that placed beneath his utmost reign
Behold him sinking in the western main
The rugged soil allows no level space
For flying chariots or the rapid race
Yet not ungrateful to the peasants pain
Suffices fulness to the swelling grain
The loaded trees their various fruits produce
And clustering grapes afford a generous juice
Woods crown our mountains and in every grove
The bounding goats and frisking heifers rove
Soft rains and kindly dews refresh the field
And rising springs eternal verdure yield
Een to those shores is Ithaca renownd
Where Troys majestic ruins strew the ground

At this the chief with transport was possessd
His panting heart exulted in his breast
Yet well dissembling his untimely joys
And veiling truth in plausible disguise
Thus with an air sincere in fiction bold
His ready tale the inventive hero told

Oft have I heard in Crete this islands name
For twas from Crete my native soil I came
Selfbanished thence I saild before the wind
And left my children and my friends behind
From fierce Idomeneus revenge I flew
Whose son the swift Orsilochus I slew
With brutal force he seized my Trojan prey
Due to the toils of many a bloody day
Unseen I scaped and favourd by the night
In a Phoenician vessel took my flight
For Pyle or Elis bound but tempests tossd
And raging billows drove us on your coast
In dead of night an unknown port we gaind
Spent with fatigue and slept secure on land
But ere the rosy morn renewd the day
While in the embrace of pleasing sleep I lay
Sudden invited by auspicious gales
They land my goods and hoist their flying sails
Abandond here my fortune I deplore
A hapless exile on a foreign shore

Thus while he spoke the blueeyed maid began
With pleasing smiles to view the godlike man
Then changed her form and now divinely bright
Joves heavenly daughter stood confessd to sight
Like a fair virgin in her beautys bloom
Skilld in the illustrious labours of the loom

O still the same Ulysses she rejoind
In useful craft successfully refined
Artful in speech in action and in mind
Sufficed it not that thy long labours passd
Secure thou seest thy native shore at last
But this to me who like thyself excel
In arts of counsel and dissembling well
To me whose wit exceeds the powers divine
No less than mortals are surpassd by thine
Knowst thou not me who made thy life my care
Through ten years wandering and through ten years war
Who taught thee arts Alcinous to persuade
To raise his wonder and engage his aid
And now appear thy treasures to protect
Conceal thy person thy designs direct
And tell what more thou must from Fate expect
Domestic woes far heavier to be borne
The pride of fools and slaves insulting scorn
But thou be silent nor reveal thy state
Yield to the force of unresisted Fate
And bear unmoved the wrongs of base mankind
The last and hardest conquest of the mind

Goddess of wisdom Ithacus replies
He who discerns thee must be truly wise
So seldom viewd and ever in disguise
When the bold Argives led their warring powers
Against proud Ilions welldefended towers
Ulysses was thy care celestial maid
Graced with thy sight and favoured with thy aid
But when the Trojan piles in ashes lay
And bound for Greece we ploughd the watery way
Our fleet dispersed and driven from coast to coast
Thy sacred presence from that hour I lost
Till I beheld thy radiant form once more
And heard thy counsels on Phaeacias shore
But by the almighty author of thy race
Tell me oh tell is this my native place
For much I fear long tracts of land and sea
Divide this coast from distant Ithaca
The sweet delusion kindly you impose
To soothe my hopes and mitigate my woes

Thus he The blueeyed goddess thus replies
How prone to doubt how cautious are the wise
Who versed in fortune fear the flattering show
And taste not half the bliss the gods bestow
The more shall Pallas aid thy just desires
And guard the wisdom which herself inspires
Others long absent from their native place
Straight seek their home and fly with eager pace
To their wives arms and childrens dear embrace
Not thus Ulysses he decrees to prove
His subjects faith and queens suspected love
Who mournd her lord twice ten revolving years
And wastes the days in grief the nights in tears
But Pallas knew thy friends and navy lost
Once more twas given thee to behold thy coast
Yet how could I with adverse Fate engage
And mighty Neptunes unrelenting rage
Now lift thy longing eyes while I restore
The pleasing prospect of thy native shore
Bebold the port of Phorcys fenced around
With rocky mountains and with olives crownd
Behold the gloomy grot whose cool recess
Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas
Whose nowneglected altars in thy reign
Blushd with the blood of sheep and oxen slain
Behold where Neritus the clouds divides
And shakes the waving forests on his sides

So spake the goddess and the prospect cleard
The mists dispersed and all the coast appeared
The king with joy confessd his place of birth
And on his knees salutes his mother earth
Then with his suppliant hands upheld in air
Thus to the seagreen sisters sends his prayer

All hail ye virgin daughters of the main
Ye streams beyond my hopes beheld again
To you once more your own Ulysses bows
Attend his transports and receive his vows
If Jove prolong my days and Pallas crown
The growing virtues of my youthful son
To you shall rites divine be ever paid
And grateful offerings on your altars laid

Thus then Minerva From that anxious breast
Dismiss those cares and leave to heaven the rest
Our task be now thy treasured stores to save
Deep in the close recesses of the cave
Then future means consult She spoke and trod
The shady grot that brightend with the god
The closest caverns of the grot she sought
The gold the brass the robes Ulysses brought
These in the secret gloom the chief disposed
The entrance with a rock the goddess closed

Now seated in the olives sacred shade
Confer the hero and the martial maid
The goddess of the azure eyes began
Son of Laertes muchexperienced man
The suitortrain thy earliest care demand
Of that luxurious race to rid the land
Three years thy house their lawless rule has seen
And proud addresses to the matchless queen
But she thy absence mourns from day to day
And inly bleeds and silent wastes away
Elusive of the bridal hour she gives
Fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives

To this Ulysses O celestial maid
Praised be thy counsel and thy timely aid
Else had I seen my native walls in vain
Like great Atrides just restored and slain
Vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate
And plan with all thy arts the scene of fate
Then then be present and my soul inspire
As when we wrappd Troys heavenbuilt walls in fire
Though leagued against me hundred heroes stand
Hundreds shall fall if Pallas aid my hand

She answerd In the dreadful day of fight
Know I am with thee strong in all my might
If thou but equal to thyself be found
What gasping numbers then shall press the ground
What human victims stain the feastful floor
How wide the pavements float with guilty gore
It fits thee now to wear a dark disguise
And secret walk unknown to mortal eyes
For this my hand shall wither every grace
And every elegance of form and face
Oer thy smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread
Turn hoar the auburn honours of thy head
Disfigure every limb with coarse attire
And in thy eyes extinguish all the fire
Add all the wants and the decays of life
Estrange thee from thy own thy son thy wife
From the loathed object every sight shall turn
And the blind suitors their destruction scorn

Go first the master of thy herds to find
True to his charge a loyal swain and kind
For thee he sighs and to the loyal heir
And chaste Penelope extends his care
At the Coracian rock he now resides
Where Arethusas sable water glides
The sable water and the copious mast
Swell the fat herd luxuriant large repast
With him rest peaceful in the rural cell
And all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell
Me into other realms my cares convey
To Sparta still with female beauty gay
For know to Sparta thy loved offspring came
To learn thy fortunes from the voice of Fame

At this the father with a fathers care
Must he too suffer he O goddess bear
Of wanderings and of woes a wretched share
Through the wild ocean plough the dangerous way
And leave his fortunes and his house a prey
Why wouldst not thou O allenlightend mind
Inform him certain and protect him kind

To whom Minerva Be thy soul at rest
And know whatever heaven ordains is best
To fame I sent him to acquire renown
To other regions is his virtue known
Secure he sits near great Atrides placed
With friendships strengthend and with honours graced
But lo an ambush waits his passage oer
Fierce foes insidious intercept the shore
In vain far sooner all the murderous brood
This injured land shall fatten with their blood

She spake then touchd him with her powerful wand
The skin shrunk up and witherd at her hand
A swift old age oer all his members spread
A sudden frost was sprinkled on his head
Nor longer in the heavy eyeball shined
The glance divine forthbeaming from the mind
His robe which spots indelible besmear
In rags dishonest flutters with the air
A stags torn hide is lappd around his reins
A rugged staff his trembling hand sustains
And at his side a wretched scrip was hung
Widepatchd and knotted to a twisted thong
So looked the chief so moved to mortal eyes
Object uncouth a man of miseries
While Pallas cleaving the wild fields of air
To Sparta flies Telemachus her care


BOOK XIV

ARGUMENT

THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS

Ulysses arrives in disguise at the house of Eumaeus where he is
received entertained and lodged with the utmost hospitality The
several discourses of that faithful old servant with the feigned
story told by Ulysses to conceal himself and other conversations
on various subjects take up this entire book



But he deepmusing oer the mountains strayd
Through mazy thickets of the woodland shade
And cavernd ways the shaggy coast along
With cliffs and nodding forests overhung
Eumaeus at his sylvan lodge he sought
A faithful servant and without a fault
Ulysses found him busied as he sate
Before the threshold of his rustic gate
Around the mansion in a circle shone
A rural portico of rugged stone
In absence of his lord with honest toil
His own industrious hands had raised the pile
The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne
Encircled with a fence of native thorn
And strong with pales by many a weary stroke
Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak
Frequent and thick Within the space were reard
Twelve ample cells the lodgments of his herd
Full fifty pregnant females each containd
The males without a smaller race remaind
Doomd to supply the suitors wasteful feast
A stock by daily luxury decreased
Now scarce four hundred left These to defend
Four savage dogs a watchful guard attend
Here sat Eumaeus and his cares applied
To form strong buskins of wellseasond hide
Of four assistants who his labour share
Three now were absent on the rural care
The fourth drove victims to a suitor train
But he of ancient faith a simple swain
Sighd while he furnishd the luxurious board
And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord

Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew
With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew
Down sat the sage and cautious to withstand
Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand
Sudden the master runs aloud he calls
And from his hasty hand the leather falls
With showers of stones he drives then far away
The scattering dogs around at distance bay

Unhappy stranger thus the faithful swain
Began with accent gracious and humane
What sorrow had been mine if at my gate
Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate
Enough of woes already have I known
Enough my masters sorrows and my own
While here ungrateful task his herds I feed
Ordaind for lawless rioters to bleed
Perhaps supported at anothers board
Far from his country roams my hapless lord
Or sighd in exile forth his latest breath
Now coverd with the eternal shade of death

But enter this my homely roof and see
Our woods not void of hospitality
Then tell me whence thou art and what the share
Of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear

He said and seconding the kind request
With friendly step precedes his unknown guest
A shaggy goats soft hide beneath him spread
And with fresh rushes heapd an ample bed
Jove touchd the heros tender soul to find
So just reception from a heart so kind
And Oh ye gods with all your blessings grace
He thus broke forth this friend of human race

The swain replied It never was our guise
To slight the poor or aught humane despise
For Jove unfold our hospitable door
Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor
Little alas is all the good I can
A man oppressd dependent yet a man
Accept such treatment as a swain affords
Slave to the insolence of youthful lords
Far hence is by unequal gods removed
That man of bounties loving and beloved
To whom whateer his slave enjoys is owed
And more had Fate allowd had been bestowd
But Fate condemnd him to a foreign shore
Much have I sorrowd but my Master more
Now cold he lies to deaths embrace resignd
Ah perish Helen perish all her kind
For whose cursed cause in Agamemnons name
He trod so fatally the paths of fame

His vest succinct then girding round his waist
Forth rushd the swain with hospitable haste
Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run
Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun
Of two his cutlass launchd the spouting blood
These quarterd singed and fixd on forks of wood
All hasty on the hissing coals he threw
And smoking back the tasteful viands drew
Broachers and all then an the board displayd
The ready meal before Ulysses laid
With flour imbrownd next mingled wine yet new
And luscious as the bees nectareous dew
Then sate companion of the friendly feast
With open look and thus bespoke his guest
Take with free welcome what our hands prepare
Such food as falls to simple servants share
The best our lords consume those thoughtless peers
Rich without bounty guilty without fears
Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest
And honour justice and the righteous breast
Pirates and conquerors of hardend mind
The foes of peace and scourges of mankind
To whom offending men are made a prey
When Jove in vengeance gives a land away
Een these when of their illgot spoils possessd
Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast
Some voice of God close whispering from within
Wretch this is villainy and this is sin
But these no doubt some oracle explore
That tells the great Ulysses is no more
Hence springs their confidence and from our sighs
Their rapine strengthens and their riots rise
Constant as Jove the night and day bestows
Bleeds a whole hecatomb a vintage flows
None matchd this heros wealth of all who reign
Oer the fair islands of the neighbouring main
Nor all the monarchs whose fardreaded sway
The wideextended continents obey
First on the main land of Ulysses breed
Twelve herds twelve flocks on oceans margin feed
As many stalls for shaggy goats are reard
As many lodgments for the tusky herd
Two foreign keepers guard and here are seen
Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green
To native pastors is their charge assignd
And mine the care to feed the bristly kind
Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd
All to the suitors wasteful board preferrd
Thus he benevolent his unknown guest
With hunger keen devours the savoury feast
While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast
Silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed
Eumaeus pours on high the purple tide
The king with smiling looks his joy expressd
And thus the kind inviting host addressd

Say now what man is he the man deplored
So rich so potent whom you style your lord
Late with such affluence and possessions blessd
And now in honours glorious bed at rest
Whoever was the warrior he must be
To fame no stranger nor perhaps to me
Who so the gods and so the Fates ordaind
Have wanderd many a sea and many a land

Small is the faith the prince and queen ascribe
Replied Eumaeus to the wandering tribe
For needy strangers still to flattery fly
And want too oft betrays the tongue to lie
Each vagrant traveller that touches here
Deludes with fallacies the royal ear
To dear remembrance makes his image rise
And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes
Such thou mayst be But he whose name you crave
Moulders in earth or welters on the wave
Or food for fish or dogs his relics lie
Or torn by birds are scatterd through the sky
So perishd he and left for ever lost
Much woe to all but sure to me the most
So mild a master never shall I find
Less dear the parents whom I left behind
Less soft my mother less my father kind
Not with such transport would my eyes run oer
Again to hail them in their native shore
As loved Ulysses once more to embrace
Restored and breathing in his natal place
That name for ever dread yet ever dear
Een in his absence I pronounce with fear
In my respect he bears a princes part
But lives a very brother in my heart

Thus spoke the faithful swain and thus rejoind
The master of his grief the man of patient mind
Ulysses friend shall view his old abodes
Distrustful as thou art nor doubt the gods
Nor speak I rashly but with faith averrd
And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard
If so a cloak and vesture be my meed
Till his return no title shall I plead
Though certain be my news and great my need
Whom want itself can force untruths to tell
My soul detests him as the gates of hell

Thou first be witness hospitable Jove
And every god inspiring social love
And witness every household power that waits
Guard of these fires and angel of these gates
Ere the next moon increase or this decay
His ancient realms Ulysses shall survey
In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn
And the lost glories of his house return

Nor shall that meed be thine nor ever more
Shall loved Ulysses hail this happy shore
Replied Eumaeus to the present hour
Now turn thy thought and joys within our power
From sad reflection let my soul repose
The name of him awakes a thousand woes
But guard him gods and to these arms restore
Not his true consort can desire him more
Not old Laertes broken with despair
Not young Telemachus his blooming heir
Alas Telemachus my sorrows flow
Afresh for thee my second cause of woe
Like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand
He grew he flourishd and he blessd the land
In all the youth his fathers image shined
Bright in his person brighter in his mind
What man or god deceived his better sense
Far on the swelling seas to wander hence
To distant Pylos hapless is he gone
To seek his fathers fate and find his own
For traitors wait his way with dire design
To end at once the great Arcesian line
But let us leave him to their wills above
The fates of men are in the hand of Jove
And now my venerable guest declare
Your name your parents and your native air
Sincere from whence begun your course relate
And to what ship I owe the friendly freight

Thus he and thus with prompt invention bold
The cautious chief his ready story told

On dark reserve what better can prevail
Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale
Than when two friends alone in peaceful place
Confer and wines and cates the table grace
But most the kind inviters cheerful face
Thus might we sit with social goblets crownd
Till the whole circle of the year goes round
Not the whole circle of the year would close
My long narration of a life of woes
But such was Heavens high will Know then I came
From sacred Crete and from a sire of fame
Castor Hylacides that name he bore
Beloved and honourd in his native shore
Blessd in his riches in his children more
Sprung of a handmaid from a bought embrace
I shared his kindness with his lawful race
But when that fate which all must undergo
From earth removed him to the shades below
The large domain his greedy sons divide
And each was portiond as the lots decide
Little alas was left my wretched share
Except a house a covert from the air
But what by niggard fortune was denied
A willing widows copious wealth supplied
My valour was my plea a gallant mind
That true to honour never laggd behind
The sex is ever to a soldier kind
Now wasting years my former strength confound
And added woes have bowd me to the ground
Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain
And mark the ruins of no vulgar man
Me Pallas gave to lead the martial storm
And the fair ranks of battle to deform
Me Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight
And tempt the secret ambush of the night
Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear
I saw him not it was not mine to fear
Before the rest I raised my ready steel
The first I met he yielded or he fell
But works of peace my soul disdaind to bear
The rural labour or domestic care
To raise the mast the missile dart to wing
And send swift arrows from the bounding string
Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind
Those gods who turn to various ends designd
The various thoughts and talents of mankind
Before the Grecians touchd the Trojan plain
Nine times commander or by land or main
In foreign fields I spread my glory far
Great in the praise rich in the spoils of war
Thence charged with riches as increased in fame
To Crete returnd an honourable name
But when great Jove that direful war decreed
Which roused all Greece and made the mighty bleed
Our states myself and Idomen employ
To lead their fleets and carry death to Troy
Nine years we warrd the tenth saw Ilion fall
Homeward we saild but heaven dispersed us all
One only month my wife enjoyd my stay
So willd the god who gives and takes away
Nine ships I mannd equippd with ready stores
Intent to voyage to the Aegyptian shores
In feast and sacrifice my chosen train
Six days consumd the seventh we ploughd the main
Cretes ample fields diminish to our eye
Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly
Safe through the level seas we sweep our way
The steersman governs and the ships obey
The fifth fair morn we stem the Aegyptian tide
And tilting oer the bay the vessels ride
To anchor there my fellows I command
And spies commission to explore the land
But swayd by lust of gain and headlong will
The coasts they ravage and the natives kill
The spreading clamour to their city flies
And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise
The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields
Horrid with bristly spears and glancing shields
Jove thunderd on their side Our guilty head
We turnd to flight the gathering vengeance spread
On all parts round and heaps on heaps lie dead
I then explored my thought what course to prove
And sure the thought was dictated by Jove
Oh had he left me to that happier doom
And saved a life of miseries to come
The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced
And low on earth my shield and javelin cast
I meet the monarch with a suppliants face
Approach his chariot and his knees embrace
He heard he saved he placed me at his side
My state he pitied and my tears he dried
Restraind the rage the vengeful foe expressd
And turnd the deadly weapons from my breast
Pious to guard the hospitable rite
And fearing Jove whom mercys works delight

In Aegypt thus with peace and plenty blessd
I lived and happy still have lived a guest
On seven bright years successive blessings wait
The next changed all the colour of my fate
A false Phoenician of insiduous mind
Versed in vile arts and foe to humankind
With semblance fair invites me to his home
I seized the proffer ever fond to roam
Domestic in his faithless roof I stayd
Till the swift sun his annual circle made
To Libya then he mediates the way
With guileful art a stranger to betray
And sell to bondage in a foreign land
Much doubting yet compelld I quit the strand
Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails
Aloof from Crete before the northern gales
But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost
And far from ken of any other coast
When all was wild expanse of sea and air
Then doomd high Jove due vengeance to prepare
He hung a night of horrors oer their head
The shaded ocean blackend as it spread
He launchd the fiery bolt from pole to pole
Broad burst the lightnings deep the thunders roll
In giddy rounds the whirling ship is tossd
An all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost
As from a hanging rocks tremendous height
The sable crows with intercepted flight
Drop endlong scarrd and black with sulphurous hue
So from the deck are hurld the ghastly crew
Such end the wicked found but Joves intent
Was yet to save the oppressd and innocent
Placed on the mast the last resource of life
With winds and waves I held unequal strife
For nine long days the billows tilting oer
The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotias shore
The monarchs son a shipwreckd wretch relieved
The sire with hospitable rites received
And in his palace like a brother placed
With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced
While here I sojournd oft I heard the fame
How late Ulysses to the country came
How loved how honourd in this court he stayd
And here his whole collected treasure laid
I saw myself the vast unnumberd store
Of steel elaborate and refulgent ore
And brass high heapd amidst the regal dome
Immense supplies for ages yet to come
Meantime he voyaged to explore the will
Of Jove on high Dodonas holy hill
What means might best his safe return avail
To come in pomp or bear a secret sail
Full oft has Phidon whilst he pourd the wine
Attesting solemn all the powers divine
That soon Ulysses would return declared
The sailors waiting and the ships prepared
But first the king dismissd me from his shores
For fair Dulichium crownd with fruitful stores
To good Acastus friendly care consignd
But other counsels pleased the sailors mind
New frauds were plotted by the faithless train
And misery demands me once again
Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave
With ready hands they rush to seize their slave
Then with these tatterd rags they wrappd me round
Strippd of my own and to the vessel bound
At eve at Ithacas delightful land
The ship arrivd forth issuing on the sand
They sought repast while to the unhappy kind
The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind
Soft I descended to the sea applied
My naked breast and shot along the tide
Soon passd beyond their sight I left the flood
And took the spreading shelter of the wood
Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mournd
But deemd inquiry vain and to their ships returnd
Screend by protecting gods from hostile eyes
They led me to a good man and a wise
To live beneath thy hospitable care
And wait the woes Heaven dooms me yet to bear

Unhappy guest whose sorrows touch my mind
Thus good Eumaeus with a sigh rejoind
For real sufferings since I grieve sincere
Check not with fallacies the springing tear
Nor turn the passion into groundless joy
For him whom Heaven has destined to destroy
Oh had he perishd on some wellfought day
Or in his friends embraces died away
That grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise
Historic marbles to record his praise
His praise eternal on the faithful stone
Had with transmissive honours graced his son
Now snatchd by harpies to the dreary coast
Sunk is the hero and his glory lost
While pensive in this solitary den
Far from gay cities and the ways of men
I linger life nor to the court repair
But when my constant queen commands my care
Or when to taste her hospitable board
Some guest arrives with rumours of her lord
And these indulge their want and those their woe
And here the tears and there the goblets flow
By many such have I been warnd but chief
By one Aetolian robbd of all belief
Whose hap it was to this our roof to roam
For murder banishd from his native home
He swore Ulysses on the coast of Crete
Stayd but a season to refit his fleet
A few revolving months should waft him oer
Fraught with bold warriors and a boundless store
O thou whom age has taught to understand
And Heaven has guided with a favouring hand
On god or mortal to obtrude a lie
Forbear and dread to flatter as to die
Nor for such ends my house and heart are free
But dear respect to Jove and charity

And why O swain of unbelieving mind
Thus quick replied the wisest of mankind
Doubt you my oath yet more my faith to try
A solemn compact let us ratify
And witness every power that rules the sky
If here Ulysses from his labours rest
Be then my prize a tunic and a vest
And where my hopes invite me straight transport
In safety to Dulichiums friendly court
But if he greets not thy desiring eye
Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high
The due reward of fraud and perjury

Doubtless O guest great laud and praise were mine
Replied the swain for spotless faith divine
If after social rites and gifts bestowd
I staind my hospitable hearth with blood
How would the gods my righteous toils succeed
And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed
No morethe approaching hours of silent night
First claim refection then to rest invite
Beneath our humble cottage let us haste
And here unenvied rural dainties taste

Thus communed these while to their lowly dome
The fullfed swine returnd with evening home
Compelld reluctant to their several sties
With din obstreperous and ungrateful cries
Then to the slaves Now from the herd the best
Select in honour of our foreign guest
With him let us the genial banquet share
For great and many are the griefs we bear
While those who from our labours heap their board
Blaspheme their feeder and forget their lord

Thus speaking with despatchful hand he took
A weighty axe and cleft the solid oak
This on the earth he piled a boar full fed
Of five years age before the pile was led
The swain whom acts of piety delight
Observant of the gods begins the rite
First shears the forehead of the bristly boar
And suppliant stands invoking every power
To speed Ulysses to his native shore
A knotty stake then aiming at his head
Down dropped he groaning and the spirit fled
The scorching flames climb round on every side
Then the singed members they with skill divide
On these in rolls of fat involved with art
The choicest morsels lay from every part
Some in the flames bestrewd with flour they threw
Some cut in fragments from the forks they drew
These while on several tables they dispose
A priest himself the blameless rustic rose
Expert the destined victim to dispart
In seven just portions pure of hand and heart
One sacred to the nymphs apart they lay
Another to the winged sons of May
The rural tribe in common share the rest
The king the chine the honour of the feast
Who sate delighted at his servants board
The faithful servant joyd his unknown lord
Oh be thou dear Ulysses cried to Jove
As well thou claimst a grateful strangers love

Be then thy thanks the bounteous swain replied
Enjoyment of the good the gods provide
From Gods own hand descend our joys and woes
These he decrees and he but suffers those
All power is his and whatsoeer he wills
The will itself omnipotent fulfils
This said the firstfruits to the gods he gave
Then pourd of offerd wine the sable wave
In great Ulysses hand he placed the bowl
He sate and sweet refection cheerd his soul
The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave
Eumaeus proper treasure bought this slave
And led from Taphos to attend his board
A servant added to his absent lord
His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay
And from the banquet take the bowls away
And now the rage of hunger was repressd
And each betakes him to his couch to rest

Now came the night and darkness coverd oer
The face of things the winds began to roar
The driving storm the watery westwind pours
And Jove descends in deluges of showers
Studious of rest and warmth Ulysses lies
Foreseeing from the first the storm would rise
In mere necessity of coat and cloak
With artful preface to his host he spoke
Hear me my friends who this good banquet grace
Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place
And wine can of their wits the wise beguile
Make the sage frolic and the serious smile
The grave in merry measures frisk about
And many a longrepented word bring out
Since to be talkative I now commence
Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense
Once I was strong would Heaven restore those days
And with my betters claimd a share of praise
Ulysses Menelaus led forth a band
And joind me with them twas their own command
A deathful ambush for the foe to lay
Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way
There clad in arms along the marshes spread
We made the osierfringed bank our bed
Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel
Nor had these shoulders covering but of steel
Sharp blew the north snow whitening all the fields
Froze with the blast and gathering glazed our shields
There all but I well fenced with cloak and vest
Lay coverd by their ample shields at rest
Fool that I was I left behind my own
The skill of weather and of winds unknown
And trusted to my coat and shield alone
When now was wasted more than half the night
And the stars faded at approaching light
Sudden I joggd Ulysses who was laid
Fast by my side and shivering thus I said

Here longer in this field I cannot lie
The winter pinches and with cold I die
And die ashamed O wisest of mankind
The only fool who left his cloak behind

He thought and answerd hardly waking yet
Sprung in his mind a momentary wit
That wit which or in council or in fight
Still met the emergence and determined right
Hush thee he cried soft whispering in my ear
Speak not a word lest any Greek may hear
And then supporting on his arm his head
Hear me companions thus aloud he said
Methinks too distant from the fleet we lie
Een now a vision stood before my eye
And sure the warning vision was from high
Let from among us some swift courier rise
Haste to the general and demand supplies

Up started Thoas straight Andraemons son
Nimbly he rose and cast his garment down
Instant the racer vanishd off the ground
That instant in his cloak I wrappd me round
And safe I slept till brightlydawning shone
The morn conspicuous on her golden throne

Oh were my strength as then as then my age
Some friend would fence me from the winters rage
Yet tatterd as I look I challenged then
The honours and the offices of men
Some master or some servant would allow
A cloak and vestbut I am nothing now

Well hast thou spoke rejoind the attentive swain
Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain
Nor garment shalt thou want nor aught beside
Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide
But in the morning take thy clothes again
For here one vest suffices every swain
No change of garments to our hinds is known
But when returnd the good Ulysses son
With better hand shall grace with fit attires
His guest and send thee where thy soul desires

The honest herdsman rose as this he said
And drew before the hearth the strangers bed
The fleecy spoils of sheep a goats rough hide
He spreads and adds a mantle thick and wide
With store to heap above him and below
And guard each quarter as the tempests blow
There lay the king and all the rest supine
All but the careful master of the swine
Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care
Well armd and fenced against nocturnal air
His weighty falchion oer his shoulder tied
His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied
With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men
He seeks his lodging in the rocky den
There to the tusky herd he bends his way
Where screend from Boreas high oerarchd they lay



BOOK XV

ARGUMENT

THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS

The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to
Ithaca Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus and arrive at
Pylos where they part and Telemachus sets sail after having
received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer The scene then
changes to the cottage of Eumaeus who entertains Ulysses with a
recital of his adventures In the meantime Telemachus arrives on
the coast and sending the vessel to the town proceeds by himself
to the lodge of Eumaeus



Now had Minerva reachd those ample plains
Famed for the dance where Menelaus reigns
Anxious she flies to great Ulysses heir
His instant voyage challenged all her care
Beneath the royal portico displayd
With Nestors son Telemachus was laid
In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies
Not thine Ulysses Care unseald his eyes
Restless he grieved with various fears oppressd
And all thy fortunes rolld within his breast
When O Telemachus the goddess said
Too long in vain too widely hast thou strayd
Thus leaving careless thy paternal right
The robbers prize the prey to lawless might
On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam
Een now the hand of rapine sacks the dome
Hence to Atrides and his leave implore
To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore
Fly whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands
Her kindreds wishes and her sires commands
Through both Eurymachus pursues the dame
And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim
Hence therefore while thy stores thy own remain
Thou knowst the practice of the female train
Lost in the children of the present spouse
They slight the pledges of their former vows
Their love is always with the lover past
Still the succeeding flame expels the last
Let oer thy house some chosen maid preside
Till Heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride
But now thy more attentive ears incline
Observe the warnings of a power divine
For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay
In Samos sands or straits of Ithaca
To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band
Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land
Nosooner far their riot and their lust
Allcovering earth shall bury deep in dust
Then distant from the scatterd islands steer
Nor let the night retard thy full career
Thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales
To smooth thy passage and supply thy sails
And when at Ithaca thy labour ends
Send to the town the vessel with thy friends
But seek thou first the master of the swine
For still to thee his loyal thoughts incline
There pass the night while he his course pursues
To bring Penelope the wishdfor news
That thou safe sailing from the Pylian strand
Art come to bless her in thy native land
Thus spoke the goddess and resumed her flight
To the pure regions of eternal light
Meanwhile Pisistratus he gently shakes
And with these words the slumbering youth awakes

Rise son of Nestor for the road prepare
And join the harnessd coursers to the car

What cause he cried can justify our flight
To tempt the dangers of forbidding night
Here wait we rather till approaching day
Shall prompt our speed and point the ready way
Nor think of flight before the Spartan king
Shall bid farewell and bounteous presents bring
Gifts which to distant ages safely stored
The sacred act of friendship shall record

Thus he But when the dawn bestreakd the east
The king from Helen rose and sought his guest
As soon as his approach the hero knew
The splendid mantle round him first he threw
Then oer his ample shoulders whirld the cloak
Respectful met the monarch and bespoke

Hail great Atrides favourd of high Jove
Let not thy friends in vain for licence move
Swift let us measure back the watery way
Nor check our speed impatient of delay

If with desire so strong thy bosom glows
Ill said the king should I thy wish oppose
For oft in others freely I reprove
The illtimed efforts of officious love
Who love too much hate in the like extreme
And both the golden mean alike condemn
Alike he thwarts the hospitable end
Who drives the free or stays the hasty friend
True friendships laws are by this rule expressd
Welcome the coming speed the parting guest
Yet stay my friends and in your chariot take
The noblest presents that our love can make
Meantime commit we to our womens care
Some choice domestic viands to prepare
The traveller rising from the banquet gay
Eludes the labours of the tedious way
Then if a wider course shall rather please
Through spacious Argos and the realms of Greece
Atrides in his chariot shall attend
Himself thy convoy to each royal friend
No prince will let Ulysses heir remove
Without some pledge some monument of love
These will the caldron these the tripod give
From those the wellpaird mules we shall receive
Or bowl embossd whose golden figures live

To whom the youth for prudence famed replied
O monarch care of heaven thy peoples pride
No friend in Ithaca my place supplies
No powerful hands are there no watchful eyes
My stores exposed and fenceless house demand
The speediest succour from my guardian hand
Lest in a search too anxious and too vain
Of one lost joy I lose what yet remain

His purpose when the generous warrior heard
He charged the household cates to be prepared
Now with the dawn from his adjoining home
Was Boethoedes Eteoneus come
Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze
And oer the coals the smoking fragments lays
Meantime the king his son and Helen went
Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent
The king selected from the glittering rows
A bowl the prince a silver beaker chose
The beauteous queen revolved with careful eyes
Her various textures of unnumberd dyes
And chose the largest with no vulgar art
Her own fair hands embroiderd every part
Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright
Like radiant Hesper oer the gems of night
Then with each gift they hastend to their guest
And thus the king Ulysses heir addressd
Since fixd are thy resolves may thundering Jove
With happiest omens thy desires approve
This silver bowl whose costly margins shine
Enchased with old this valued gift be thine
To me this present of Vulcanian frame
From Sidons hospitable monarch came
To thee we now consign the precious load
The pride of kings and labour of a god

Then gave the cup while Megapenthe brought
The silver vase with living sculpture wrought
The beauteous queen advancing next displayd
The shining veil and thus endearing said

Accept dear youth this monument of love
Long since in better days by Helen wove
Safe in thy mothers care the vesture lay
To deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day
Meantime mayst thou with happiest speed regain
Thy stately palace and thy wide domain

She said and gave the veil with grateful look
The prince the variegated present took
And now when through the royal dome they passd
High on a throne the king each stranger placed
A golden ewer the attendant damsel brings
Replete with water from the crystal springs
With copious streams the shining vase supplies
A silver layer of capacious size
They wash The tables in fair order spread
The glittering canisters are crownd with bread
Viands of various kinds allure the taste
Of choicest sort and savour rich repast
Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares
Atrides son the purple draught prepares
And now each sated with the genial feast
And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceased
Ulysses son with his illustrious friend
The horses join the polishd car ascend
Along the court the fiery steeds rebound
And the wide portal echoes to the sound
The king precedes a bowl with fragrant wine
Libation destined to the powers divine
His right hand held before the steed he stands
Then mixd with prayers he utters these commands

Farewell and prosper youths let Nestor know
What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow
For all the proofs of his paternal care
Through the long dangers of the ten years war
Ah doubt not our report the prince rejoind
Of all the virtues of thy generous mind
And oh returnd might we Ulysses meet
To him thy presents show thy words repeat
How will each speech his grateful wonder raise
How will each gift indulge us in thy praise

Scarce ended thus the prince when on the right
Advanced the bird of Jove auspicious sight
A milkwhite fowl his clinching talons bore
With care domestic pampered at the floor
Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue
In solemn speed the bird majestic flew
Full dexter to the car the prosperous sight
Filld every breast with wonder and delight

But Nestors son the cheerful silence broke
And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke
Say if to us the gods these omens send
Or fates peculiar to thyself portend

Whilst yet the monarch paused with doubts oppressd
The beauteous queen relieved his labouring breast
Hear me she cried to whom the gods have given
To read this sign and mystic sense of heaven
As thus the plumy sovereign of the air
Left on the mountains brow his callow care
And wanderd through the wide ethereal way
To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey
So shall thy godlike father tossd in vain
Through all the dangers of the boundless main
Arrive or if perchance already come
From slaughterd gluttons to release the dome

Oh if this promised bliss by thundering Jove
The prince replied stand fixd in fate above
To thee as to some god Ill temples raise
And crown thy altars with the costly blaze

He said and bending oer his chariot flung
Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong
The bounding shafts upon the harness play
Till night descending intercepts the way
To Diocles at Pherae they repair
Whose boasted sire was sacred Alpheus heir
With him all night the youthful stranger stayd
Nor found the hospitable rites unpaid
But soon as morning from her orient bed
Had tinged the mountains with her earliest red
They joind the steeds and on the chariot sprung
The brazen portals in their passage rung

To Pylos soon they came when thus begun
To Nestors heir Ulysses godlike son

Let not Pisistratus in vain be pressd
Nor unconsenting hear his friends request
His friend by long hereditary claim
In toils his equal and in years the same
No farther from our vessel I implore
The courses drive but lash them to the shore
Too long thy father would his friend detain
I dread his profferd kindness urged in vain

The hero paused and ponderd this request
While love and duty warrd within his breast
At length resolved he turnd his ready hand
And lashd his panting coursers to the strand
There while within the poop with care he stored
The regal presents of the Spartan lord
With speed begone said he call every mate
Ere yet to Nestor I the tale relate
Tis true the fervour of his generous heart
Brooks no repulse nor couldst thou soon depart
Himself will seek thee here nor wilt thou find
In words alone the Pylian monarch kind
But when arrived he thy return shall know
How will his breast with honest fury glow
This said the sounding strokes his horses fire
And soon he reached the palace of his sire

Now cried Telemachus with speedy care
Hoist every sail and every oar prepare
Swift as the word his willing mates obey
And seize their seats impatient for the sea

Meantime the prince with sacrifice adores
Minerva and her guardian aid implores
When lo a wretch ran breathless to the shore
New from his crime and reeking yet with gore
A seer he was from great Melampus sprung
Melampus who in Pylos flourishd long
Till urged by wrongs a foreign realm he chose
Far from the hateful cause of all his woes
Neleus his treasures one long year detains
As long he groand in Philacus chains
Meantime what anguish and what rage combined
For lovely Pero rackd his labouring mind
Yet scaped he death and vengeful of his wrong
To Pylos drove the lowing herds along
Then Neleus vanquishd and consignd the fair
To Bias arms he so sought a foreign air
Argos the rich for his retreat he chose
There formd his empire there his palace rose
From him Antiphates and Mantius came
The first begot Oicleus great in fame
And he Amphiaraus immortal name
The peoples saviour and divinely wise
Beloved by Jove and him who gilds the skies
Yet short his date of life by female pride he dies
From Mantius Clitus whom Auroras love
Snatchd for his beauty to the thrones above
And Polyphides on whom Phoebus shone
With fullest rays Amphiaraus now gone
In Hyperesias groves he made abode
And taught mankind the counsels of the god
From him sprung Theoclymenus who found
The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground
Telemachus whom as to Heaven he pressd
His ardent vows the stranger thus addressd

O thou that dost thy happy course prepare
With pure libations and with solemn prayer
By that dread power to whom thy vows are paid
By all the lives of these thy own dear head
Declare sincerely to no foes demand
Thy name thy lineage and paternal land

Prepare then said Telemachus to know
A tale from falsehood free not free from woe
From Ithaca of royal birth I came
And great Ulysses ever honourd name
Once was my sire though now for ever lost
In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost
Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove
The last the wretched proof of filial love

The stranger then Nor shall I aught conceal
But the dire secret of my fate reveal
Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew
Whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue
With unrelenting rage and force from home
The bloodstaind exile ever doomd to roam
But bear oh bear me oer yon azure flood
Receive the suppliant spare my destined blood

Stranger replied the prince securely rest
Affianced in our faith henceforth our guest
Thus affable Ulysses godlike heir
Takes from the strangers hand the glittering spear
He climbs the ship ascends the stern with haste
And by his side the guest accepted placed
The chief his order gives the obedient band
With due observance wait the chiefs command
With speed the mast they rear with speed unbind
The spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
Minerva calls the ready gales obey
With rapid speed to whirl them oer the sea
Crunus they passd next Chalcis rolld away
With thickening darkness closed the doubtful day
The silver Phaeas glittering rills they lost
And skimmd along by Elis sacred coast
Then cautious through the rocky reaches wind
And turning sudden shun the death designd

Meantime the king Eumaeus and the rest
Sate in the cottage at their rural feast
The banquet passd and satiate every man
To try his host Ulysses thus began

Yet one night more my friends indulge your guest
The last I purpose in your walls to rest
Tomorrow for myself I must provide
And only ask your counsel and a guide
Patient to roam the street by hunger led
And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread
There in Ulysses roof I may relate
Ulysses wanderings to his royal mate
Or mingling with the suitors haughty train
Not undeserving some support obtain
Hermes to me his various gifts imparts
Patron of industry and manual arts
Few can with me in dexterous works contend
The pyre to build the stubborn oak to rend
To turn the tasteful viand oer the flame
Or foam the goblet with a purple stream
Such are the tasks of men of mean estate
Whom fortune dooms to serve the rich and great

Alas Eumaeus with a sigh rejoind
How sprung a thought so monstrous in thy mind
If on that godless race thou wouldst attend
Fate owes thee sure a miserable end
Their wrongs and blasphemies ascend the sky
And pull descending vengeance from on high
Not such my friend the servants of their feast
A blooming train in rich embroidery dressd
With earths whole tribute the bright table bends
And smiling round celestial youth attends
Stay then no eye askance beholds thee here
Sweet is thy converse to each social ear
Well pleased and pleasing in our cottage rest
Till good Telemachus accepts his guest
With genial gifts and change of fair attires
And safe conveys thee where thy soul desires

To him the man of woes O gracious Jove
Reward this strangers hospitable love
Who knows the son of sorrow to relieve
Cheers the sad heart nor lets affliction grieve
Of all the ills unhappy mortals know
A life of wanderings is the greatest woe
On all their weary ways wait care and pain
And pine and penury a meagre train
To such a man since harbour you afford
Relate the farther fortunes of your lord
What cares his mothers tender breast engage
And sire forsaken on the verge of age
Beneath the sun prolong they yet their breath
Or range the house of darkness and of death

To whom the swain Attend what you enquire
Laertes lives the miserable sire
Lives but implores of every power to lay
The burden down and wishes for the day
Torn from his offspring in the eve of life
Torn from the embraces of his tender wife
Sole and all comfortless he wastes away
Old age untimely posting ere his day
She too sad mother for Ulysses lost
Pined out her bloom and vanishd to a ghost
So dire a fate ye righteous gods avert
From every friendly every feeling heart
While yet she was though clouded oer with grief
Her pleasing converse ministerd relief
With Climene her youngest daughter bred
One roof containd us and one table fed
But when the softlystealing pace of time
Crept on from childhood into youthful prime
To Samos isle she sent the wedded fair
Me to the fields to tend the rural care
Arrayd in garments her own hands had wove
Nor less the darling object of her love
Her hapless death my brighter days oercast
Yet Providence deserts me not at last
My present labours food and drink procure
And more the pleasure to relieve the poor
Small is the comfort from the queen to hear
Unwelcome news or vex the royal ear
Blank and discountenanced the servants stand
Nor dare to question where the proud command
No profit springs beneath usurping powers
Want feeds not there where luxury devours
Nor harbours charity where riot reigns
Proud are the lords and wretched are the swains

The suffering chief at this began to melt
And O Eumaeus thou he cries hast felt
The spite of fortune too her cruel hand
Snatchd thee an infant from thy native land
Snatchd from thy parents arms thy parents eyes
To early wants a man of miseries
The whole sad story from its first declare
Sunk the fair city by the rage of war
Where once thy parents dwelt or did they keep
In humbler life the lowing herds and sheep
So left perhaps to tend the fleecy train
Rude pirates seized and shippd thee oer the main
Doomd a fair prize to grace some princes board
The worthy purchase of a foreign lord

If then my fortunes can delight my friend
A story fruitful of events attend
Anothers sorrow may thy ears enjoy
And wine the lengthend intervals employ
Long nights the now declining year bestows
A part we consecrate to soft repose
A part in pleasing talk we entertain
For too much rest itself becomes a pain
Let those whom sleep invites the call obey
Their cares resuming with the dawning day
Here let us feast and to the feast be joind
Discourse the sweeter banquet of the mind
Review the series of our lives and taste
The melancholy joy of evils passd
For he who much has sufferd much will know
And pleased remembrance builds delight on woe

Above Ortygia lies an isle of fame
Far hence remote and Syria is the name
There curious eyes inscribed with wonder trace
The suns diurnal and his annual race
Not large but fruitful stored with grass to keep
The bellowing oxen and the bleating sheep
Her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn
And her rich valleys wave with golden corn
No want no famine the glad natives know
Nor sink by sickness to the shades below
But when a length of years unnerves the strong
Apollo comes and Cynthia comes along
They bend the silver bow with tender skill
And void of pain the silent arrows kill
Two equal tribes this fertile land divide
Where two fair cities rise with equal pride
But both in constant peace one prince obey
And Ctesius there my father holds the sway
Freighted it seems with toys of every sort
A ship of Sidon anchord in our port
What time it chanced the palace entertaind
Skilld in rich works a woman of their land
This nymph where anchord the Phoenician train
To wash her robes descending to the main
A smooth tongued sailor won her to his mind
For love deceives the best of womankind
A sudden trust from sudden liking grew
She told her name her race and all she knew
I too she cried from glorious Sidon came
My father Arybas of wealthy fame
But snatchd by pirates from my native place
The Taphians sold me to this mans embrace

Haste then the false designing youth replied
Haste to thy country love shall be thy guide
Haste to thy fathers house thy fathers breast
For still he lives and lives with riches blest

Swear first she cried ye sailors to restore
A wretch in safety to her native shore
Swift as she askd the ready sailors swore
She then proceeds Now let our compact made
Be nor by signal nor by word betrayd
Nor near me any of your crew descried
By road frequented or by fountain side
Be silence still our guard The monarchs spies
For watchful age is ready to surmise
Are still at hand and this revealed must be
Death to yourselves eternal chains to me
Your vessel loaded and your traffic passd
Despatch a wary messenger with haste
Then gold and costly treasures will I bring
And more the infant offspring of the king
Him childlike wandering forth Ill lead away
A noble prize and to your ship convey

Thus spoke the dame and homeward took the road
A year they traffic and their vessel load
Their stores complete and ready now to weigh
A spy was sent their summons to convey
An artist to my fathers palace came
With gold and amber chains elaborate frame
Each female eye the glittering links employ
They turn review and cheapen every toy
He took the occasion as they stood intent
Gave her the sign and to his vessel went
She straight pursued and seized my willing arm
I followd smiling innocent of harm
Three golden goblets in the porch she found
The guests not enterd but the table crownd
Hid in her fraudful bosom these she bore
Now set the sun and darkend all the shore
Arriving then where tilting on the tides
Prepared to launch the freighted vessel rides
Aboard they heave us mount their decks and sweep
With level oar along the glassy deep
Six calmy days and six smooth nights we sail
And constant Jove supplied the gentle gale
The seventh the fraudful wretch no cause descried
Touchd by Dianas vengeful arrow died
Down droppd the caitiffcorse a worthless load
Down to the deep there rolld the future food
Of fierce seawolves and monsters of the flood
An helpless infant I remaind behind
Thence borne to Ithaca by wave and wind
Sold to Laertes by divine command
And now adopted to a foreign land

To him the king Reciting thus thy cares
My secret soul in all thy sorrow shares
But one choice blessing such is Joves high will
Has sweetend all thy bitter draught of ill
Torn from thy country to no hapless end
The gods have in a master given a friend
Whatever frugal nature needs is thine
For she needs little daily bread and wine
While I so many wanderings past and woes
Live but on what thy poverty bestows

So passed in pleasing dialogue away
The night then down to short repose they lay
Till radiant rose the messenger of day
While in the port of Ithaca the band
Of young Telemachus approachd the land
Their sails they loosed they lashd the mast aside
And cast their anchors and the cables tied
Then on the breezy shore descending join
In grateful banquet oer the rosy wine
When thus the prince Now each his course pursue
I to the fields and to the city you
Long absent hence I dedicate this day
My swains to visit and the works survey
Expect me with the morn to pay the skies
Our debt of safe return in feast and sacrifice

Then Theoclymenus But who shall lend
Meantime protection to thy stranger friend
Straight to the queen and palace shall I fly
Or yet more distant to some lord apply

The prince returnd Renownd in days of yore
Has stood our fathers hospitable door
No other roof a stranger should receive
No other hands than ours the welcome give
But in my absence riot fills the place
Nor bears the modest queen a strangers face
From noiseful revel far remote she flies
But rarely seen or seen with weeping eyes
Nolet Eurymachus receive my guest
Of nature courteous and by far the best
He woos the queen with more respectful flame
And emulates her former husbands fame
With what success tis Joves alone to know
And the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe

Thus speaking on the right upsoard in air
The hawk Apollos swiftwingd messenger
His dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove
The clotted feathers scatterd from above
Between the hero and the vessel pour
Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower

The observing augur took the prince aside
Seized by the hand and thus prophetic cried
Yon bird that dexter cuts the aerial road
Rose ominous nor flies without a god
No race but thine shall Ithaca obey
To thine for ages Heaven decrees the sway

Succeed the omens gods the youth rejoind
Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind
And soon each envied happiness attend
The man who calls Telemachus his friend
Then to Peiraeus Thou whom time has proved
A faithful servant by thy prince beloved
Till we returning shall our guest demand
Accept this charge with honour at our hand

To this Peiraeus Joyful I obey
Well pleased the hospitable rites to pay
The presence of thy guest shall best reward
If long thy stay the absence of my lord

With that their anchors he commands to weigh
Mount the tall bark and launch into the sea
All with obedient haste forsake the shores
And placed in order spread their equal oars
Then from the deck the prince his sandals takes
Poised in his hand the pointed javelin shakes
They part while lessening from the heros view
Swift to the town the wellrowd galley flew
The hero trod the margin of the main
And reachd the mansion of his faithful swain



BOOK XVI

ARGUMENT

THE DISCOVERY OF ULYSSES TO TELEMACHUS

Telemachus arriving at the lodge of Eumaeus sends him to carry
Penelope the news of his return Minerva appearing to Ulysses
commands him to discover himself to his son The princes who had
lain in ambush to intercept Telemachus in his way their project
being defeated return to Ithaca



Soon as the morning blushd along the plains
Ulysses and the monarch of the swains
Awake the sleeping fires their meals prepare
And forth to pasture send the bristly care
The princes near approach the dogs descry
And fawning round his feet confess their joy
Their gentle blandishment the king surveyd
Heard his resounding step and instant said

Some wellknown friend Eumaeus bends this way
His steps I hear the dogs familiar play

While yet he spoke the prince advancing drew
Nigh to the lodge and now appeard in view
Transported from his seat Eumaeus sprung
Droppd the full bowl and round his bosom hung
Kissing his cheek his hand while from his eye
The tears raind copious in a shower of joy
As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves
From foreign climes an only son receives
Child of his age with strong paternal joy
Forward he springs and clasps the favourite boy
So round the youth his arms Eumaeus spread
As if the grave had given him from the dead

And is it thou my everdear delight
Oh art thou come to bless my longing sight
Never I never hoped to view this day
When oer the waves you ploughd the desperate way
Enter my child Beyond my hopes restored
Oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord
Enter oh seldom seen for lawless powers
Too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers
The prince replied Eumaeus I obey
To seek thee friend I hither took my way
But say if in the court the queen reside
Severely chaste or if commenced a bride

Thus he and thus the monarch of the swains
Severely chaste Penelope remains
But lost to every joy she wastes the day
In tedious cares and weeps the night away

He ended and receiving as they pass
The javelin pointed with a star of brass
They reachd the dome the dome with marble shined
His seat Ulysses to the prince resignd
Not so exclaims the prince with decent grace
For me this house shall find an humbler place
To usurp the honours due to silver hairs
And reverend strangers modest youth forbears
Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies
And bids the rural throne with osiers rise
There sate the prince the feast Eumaeus spread
And heapd the shining canisters with bread
Thick oer the board the plenteous viands lay
The frugal remnants of the former day
Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines
Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines
And now the rage of thirst and hunger fled
Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said

Whence father from what shore this stranger say
What vessel bore him oer the watery way
To human step our land impervious lies
And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise

The swain returns A tale of sorrows hear
In spacious Crete he drew his natal air
Long doomd to wander oer the land and main
For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain
Half breathless scaping to the land he flew
From Thesprot mariners a murderous crew
To thee my son the suppliant I resign
I gave him my protection grant him thine

Hard task he cries thy virtue gives thy friend
Willing to aid unable to defend
Can strangers safely in the court reside
Midst the swelld insolence of lust and pride
Een I unsafe the queen in doubt to wed
Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed
Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame
Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name
However stranger from our grace receive
Such honours as befit a prince to give
Sandals a sword and robes respect to prove
And safe to sail with ornaments of love
Till then thy guest amid the rural train
Far from the court from danger far detain
Tis mine with food the hungry to supply
And clothe the naked from the inclement sky
Here dwell in safety from the suitors wrongs
And the rude insults of ungovernd tongues
For shouldst thou suffer powerless to relieve
I must behold it and can only grieve
The brave encompassd by an hostile train
Oerpowerd by numbers is but brave in vain

To whom while anger in his bosom glows
With warmth replies the man of mighty woes
Since audience mild is deignd permit my tongue
At once to pity and resent thy wrong
My heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave
Live to base insolence or power a slave
But tell me dost thou prince dost thou behold
And hear their midnight revels uncontrolld
Say do thy subjects in bold faction rise
Or priests in fabled oracles advise
Or are thy brothers who should aid thy power
Turnd mean deserters in the needful hour
Oh that I were from great Ulysses sprung
Or that these witherd nerves like thine were strung
Or heavens might he return and soon appear
He shall I trust a hero scorns despair
Might he return I yield my life a prey
To my worst foe if that avenging day
Be not their last but should I lose my life
Oppressd by numbers in the glorious strife
I chose the nobler part and yield my breath
Rather than bear dishonor worse than death
Than see the hand of violence invade
The reverend stranger and the spotless maid
Than see the wealth of kings consumed in waste
The drunkards revel and the gluttons feast

Thus he with anger flashing from his eye
Sincere the youthful hero made reply
Nor leagued in factious arms my subjects rise
Nor priests in fabled oracles advise
Nor are my brothers who should aid my power
Turnd mean deserters in the needful hour
Ah me I boast no brother heavens dread King
Gives from our stock an only branch to spring
Alone Laertes reignd Arcesius heir
Alone Ulysses drew the vital air
And I alone the bed connubial graced
An unblessd offspring of a sire unblessd
Each neighbouring realm conducive to our woe
Sends forth her peers and every peer a foe
The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills
And lofty Zacinth crownd with shady hills
Een Ithaca and all her lords invade
The imperial sceptre and the regal bed
The queen averse to love yet awed by power
Seems half to yield yet flies the bridal hour
Meantime their licence uncontrolld I bear
Een now they envy me the vital air
But Heaven will sure revenge and gods there are

But go Eumaeus to the queen impart
Our safe return and ease a mothers heart
Yet secret go for numerous are my foes
And here at least I may in peace repose

To whom the swain I hear and I obey
But old Laertes weeps his life away
And deems thee lost shall I speed employ
To bless his age a messenger of joy
The mournful hour that tore his son away
Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray
Yet busied with his slaves to ease his woe
He dressd the vine and bade the garden blow
Nor food nor wine refused but since the day
That you to Pylos ploughd the watery way
Nor wine nor food he tastes but sunk in woes
Wild springs the vine no more the garden blows
Shut from the walks of men to pleasure lost
Pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost

Wretched old man with tears the prince returns
Yet cease to gowhat man so blest but mourns
Were every wish indulged by favouring skies
This hour should give Ulysses to my eyes
But to the queen with speed dispatchful bear
Our safe return and back with speed repair
And let some handmaid of her train resort
To good Laertes in his rural court

While yet he spoke impatient of delay
He braced his sandals on and strode away
Then from the heavens the martial goddess flies
Through the wild fields of air and cleaves the skies
In form a virgin in soft beautys bloom
Skilld in the illustrious labours of the loom
Alone to Ithaca she stood displayd
But unapparent as a viewless shade
Escaped Telemachus the powers above
Seen or unseen oer earth at pleasure move
The dogs intelligent confessd the tread
Of power divine and howling trembling fled
The goddess beckoning waves her deathless hands
Dauntless the king before the goddess stands

Then why she said O favourd of the skies
Why to thy godlike son this long disguise
Stand forth reveald with him thy cares employ
Against thy foes be valiant and destroy
Lo I descend in that avenging hour
To combat by thy side thy guardian power

She said and oer him waves her wand of gold
Imperial robes his manly limbs infold
At once with grace divine his frame improves
At once with majesty enlarged he moves
Youth flushd his reddening cheek and from his brows
A length of hair in sable ringlets flows
His blackening chin receives a deeper shade
Then from his eyes upsprung the warriormaid

The hero reascends the prince oerawed
Scarce lifts his eyes and bows as to a god
Then with surprise surprise chastised by fears
How art thou changed he crieda god appears
Far other vests thy limbs majestic grace
Far other glories lighten from thy face
If heaven be thy abode with pious care
Lo I the ready sacrifice prepare
Lo gifts of labourd gold adorn thy shrine
To win thy grace O save us power divine

Few are my days Ulysses made reply
Nor I alas descendant of the sky
I am thy father O my son my son
That father for whose sake thy days have run
One scene of woe to endless cares consignd
And outraged by the wrongs of base mankind

Then rushing to his arms he kissd his boy
With the strong raptures of a parents joy
Tears bathe his cheek and tears the ground bedew
He straind him close as to his breast he grew
Ah me exclaims the prince with fond desire
Thou art notno thou canst not be my sire
Heaven such illusion only can impose
By the false joy to aggravate my woes
Who but a god can change the general doom
And give to witherd age a youthful bloom
Late worn with years in weeds obscene you trod
Now clothed in majesty you move a god

Forbear he cried for Heaven reserve that name
Give to thy father but a fathers claim
Other Ulysses shalt thou never see
I am Ulysses I my son am he
Twice ten sad years oer earth and ocean tossd
Tis given at length to view my native coast
Pallas unconquerd maid my frame surrounds
With grace divine her power admits no bounds
She oer my limbs old age and wrinkles shed
Now strong as youth magnificent I tread
The gods with ease frail man depress or raise
Exalt the lowly or the proud debase

He spoke and sate The prince with transport flew
Hung round his neck while tears his cheek bedew
Nor less the father pourd a social flood
They wept abundant and they wept aloud
As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung
Or parent vulture mourns her ravishd young
They cry they scream their unfledged brood a prey
To some rude churl and borne by stealth away
So they aloud and tears in tides had run
Their grief unfinishd with the setting sun
But checking the full torrent in its flow
The prince thus interrupts the solemn woe
What ship transported thee O father say
And what blessd hands have oard thee on the way

All all Ulysses instant made reply
I tell thee all my child my only joy
Phaeacians bore me to the port assignd
A nation ever to the stranger kind
Wrappd in the embrace of sleep the faithful train
Oer seas conveyd me to my native reign
Embroiderd vestures gold and brass are laid
Conceald in caverns in the sylvan shade
Hither intent the rival rout to slay
And plan the scene of death I bend my way
So Pallas willsbut thou my son explain
The names and numbers of the audacious train
Tis mine to judge if better to employ
Assistant force or singly to destroy

Oer earth returns the prince resounds thy name
Thy welltried wisdom and thy martial fame
Yet at thy words I start in wonder lost
Can we engage not decades but an host
Can we alone in furious battle stand
Against that numerous and determined band
Hear then their numbers from Dulichium came
Twice twentysix all peers of mighty name
Six are their menial train twice twelve the boast
Of Samos twenty from Zacynthus coast
And twelve our countrys pride to these belong
Medon and Phemius skilld in heavenly song
Two sewers from day to day the revels wait
Exact of taste and serve the feast in state
With such a foe the unequal fight to try
Were by false courage unrevenged to die
Then what assistant powers you boast relate
Ere yet we mingle in the stern debate

Mark well my voice Ulysses straight replies
What need of aids if favourd by the skies
If shielded to the dreadful fight we move
By mighty Pallas and by thundering Jove

Sufficient they Telemachus rejoind
Against the banded powers of all mankind
They high enthroned above the rolling clouds
Wither the strength of man and awe the gods

Such aids expect he cries when strong in might
We rise terrific to the task of fight
But thou when morn salutes the aerial plain
The court revisit and the lawless train
Me thither in disguise Eumaeus leads
An aged mendicant in tatterd weeds
There if base scorn insult my reverend age
Bear it my son repress thy rising rage
If outraged cease that outrage to repel
Bear it my son howeer thy heart rebel
Yet strive by prayer and counsel to restrain
Their lawless insults though thou strive in vain
For wicked ears are deaf to wisdoms call
And vengeance strikes whom Heaven has doomd to fall
Once more attend when she whose power inspires
The thinking mind my soul to vengeance fires
I give the sign that instant from beneath
Aloft convey the instruments of death
Armour and arms and if mistrust arise
Thus veil the truth in plausible disguise

These glittering weapons ere he saild to Troy
Ulysses viewd with stern heroic joy
Then beaming oer the illumined wall they shone
Now dust dishonours all their lustre gone
I bear them hence so Jove my soul inspires
From the pollution of the fuming fires
Lest when the bowl inflames in vengeful mood
Ye rush to arms and stain the feast with blood
Oft ready swords in luckless hour incite
The hand of wrath and arm it for the fight

Such be the plea and by the plea deceive
For Jove infatuates all and all believe
Yet leave for each of us a sword to wield
A pointed javelin and a fenceful shield
But by my blood that in thy bosom glows
By that regard a son his father owes
The secret that thy father lives retain
Lockd in thy bosom from the household train
Hide it from all een from Eumaeus hide
From my dear father and my dearer bride
One care remains to note the loyal few
Whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew
And noting ere we rise in vengeance prove
Who love his prince for sure you merit love

To whom the youth To emulate I aim
The brave and wise and my great fathers fame
But reconsider since the wisest err
Vengeance resolved tis dangerous to defer
What length of time must we consume in vain
Too curious to explore the menial train
While the proud foes industrious to destroy
Thy wealth in riot the delay enjoy
Suffice it in this exigence alone
To mark the damsels that attend the throne
Dispersed the youth reside their faith to prove
Jove grants henceforth if thou hast spoke from Jove

While in debate they waste the hours away
The associates of the prince repassd the bay
With speed they guide the vessel to the shores
With speed debarking land the naval stores
Then faithful to their charge to Clytius bear
And trust the presents to his friendly care
Swift to the queen a herald flies to impart
Her sons return and ease a parents heart
Lest a sad prey to evermusing cares
Pale grief destroy what time awhile forbears
The incautious herald with impatience burns
And cries aloud Thy son O queen returns
Eumaeus sage approachd the imperial throne
And breathed his mandate to her ear alone
Then measured back the way The suitor band
Stung to the soul abashd confounded stand
And issuing from the dome before the gate
With clouded looks a pale assembly sate

At length Eurymachus Our hopes are vain
Telemachus in triumph sails the main
Haste rear the mast the swelling shroud display
Haste to our ambushd friends the news convey

Scarce had he spake when turning to the strand
Amphinomos surveyd the associate band
Full to the bay within the winding shores
With gatherd sails they stood and lifted oars
O friends he cried elate with rising joy
See to the port secure the vessel fly
Some god has told them or themselves survey
The bark escaped and measure back their way

Swift at the word descending to the shores
They moor the vessel and unlade the stores
Then moving from the strand apart they sate
And full and frequent formd a dire debate

Lives then the boy he lives Antinous cries
The care of gods and favourite of the skies
All night we watchd till with her orient wheels
Aurora flamed above the eastern hills
And from the lofty brow of rocks by day
Took in the ocean with a broad survey
Yet safe he sails the powers celestial give
To shun the hidden snares of death and live
But die he shall and thus condemnd to bleed
Be now the scene of instant death decreed
Hope ye success undaunted crush the foe
Is he not wise know this and strike the blow
Wait ye till he to arms in council draws
The Greeks averse too justly to our cause
Strike ere the states convened the foe betray
Our murderous ambush on the watery way
Or choose ye vagrant from their rage to fly
Outcasts of earth to breathe an unknown sky
The brave prevent misfortune then be brave
And bury future danger in his grave
Returns he ambushd well his walk invade
Or where he hides in solitude and shade
And give the palace to the queen a dower
Or him she blesses in the bridal hour
But if submissive you resign the sway
Slaves to a boy go flatter and obey
Retire we instant to our native reign
Nor be the wealth of kings consumed in vain
Then wed whom choice approves the queen be given
To some blest prince the prince decreed by Heaven

Abashd the suitor train his voice attends
Till from his throne Amphinomus ascends
Who oer Dulichium stretchd his spacious reign
A land of plenty blessd with every grain
Chief of the numbers who the queen addressd
And though displeasing yet displeasing least
Soft were his words his actions wisdom swayd
Graceful awhile he paused then mildly said

O friends forbear and be the thought withstood
Tis horrible to shed imperial blood
Consult we first the allseeing powers above
And the sure oracles of righteous Jove
If they assent een by this hand he dies
If they forbid I war not with the skies

He said the rival train his voice approved
And rising instant to the palace moved
Arrived with wild tumultuous noise they sate
Recumbent on the shining thrones of state

The Medon conscious of their dire debates
The murderous counsel to the queen relates
Touchd at the dreadful story she descends
Her hasty steps a damsel train attends
Full where the dome its shining valves expands
Sudden before the rival powers she stands
And veiling decent with a modest shade
Her cheek indignant to Antinous said

O void of faith of all bad men the worst
Renownd for wisdom by the abuse accursed
Mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind
Thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind
Wretch to destroy a prince that friendship gives
While in his guest his murderer he receives
Nor dread superior Jove to whom belong
The cause of suppliants and revenge of wrong
Hast thou forgot ungrateful as thou art
Who saved thy father with a friendly part
Lawless he ravaged with his martial powers
The Taphian pirates on Thesprotias shores
Enraged his life his treasures they demand
Ulysses saved him from the avengers hand
And wouldst thou evil for his good repay
His bed dishonour and his house betray
Afflict his queen and with a murderous hand
Destroy his heirbut cease tis I command

Far hence those fears Eurymachus replied
O prudent princess bid thy soul confide
Breathes there a man who dares that hero slay
While I behold the golden light of day
No by the righteous powers of heaven I swear
His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear
Ulysses when my infant days I led
With wine sufficed me and with dainties fed
My generous soul abhors the ungrateful part
And my friends son lives nearest to my heart
Then fear no mortal arm if Heaven destroy
We must resign for man is born to die

Thus smooth he ended yet his death conspired
Then sorrowing with sad step the queen retired
With streaming eyes all comfortless deplored
Touchd with the dear remembrance of her lord
Nor ceased till Pallas bids her sorrows fly
And in soft slumber seald her flowing eye

And now Eumaeus at the evening hour
Came late returning to his sylvan bower
Ulysses and his son had dressd with art
A yearling boar and gave the gods their part
Holy repast That instant from the skies
The martial goddess to Ulysses flies
She waves her golden wand and reassumes
From every feature every grace that blooms
At once his vestures change at once she sheds
Age oer his limbs that tremble as he treads
Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly
Unable to contain the unruly joy
When near he drew the prince breaks forth Proclaim
What tidings friend what speaks the voice of fame
Say if the suitors measure back the main
Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain

Whether he cries they measure back the flood
Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood
Escaped my care where lawless suitors sway
Thy mandate borne my soul disdaind to stay
But from the Hermaean height I cast a view
Where to the port a bark highbounding flew
Her freight a shining band with martial air
Each poised his shield and each advanced his spear
And if aright these searching eyes survey
The eluded suitors stem the watery way

The prince well pleased to disappoint their wiles
Steals on his sire a glance and secret smiles
And now a short repast prepared they fed
Till the keen rage of craving hunger fled
Then to repose withdrawn apart they lay
And in soft sleep forgot the cares of day



BOOK XVII

ARGUMENT

Telemachus returning to the city relates to Penelope the sum of
his travels Ulysses is conducted by Eumaeus to the palace where
his old dog Argus acknowledges his master after an absence of
twenty years and dies with joy Eumaeus returns into the country
and Ulysses remains among the suitors whose behaviour is
described



Soon as Aurora daughter of the dawn
Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn
In haste the prince arose prepared to part
His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart
Fair on his feet the polishd sandals shine
And thus he greets the master of the swine

My friend adieu let this short stay suffice
I haste to meet my mothers longing eyes
And end her tears her sorrows and her sighs
But thou attentive what we order heed
This hapless stranger to the city lead
By public bounty let him there be fed
And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread
To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes
My will may covet but my power denies
If this raise anger in the strangers thought
The pain of anger punishes the fault
The very truth I undisguised declare
For what so easy as to be sincere

To this Ulysses What the prince requires
Of swift removal seconds my desires
To want like mine the peopled town can yield
More hopes of comfort than the lonely field
Nor fits my age to till the labourd lands
Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands
Adieu but since this ragged garb can bear
So ill the inclemencies of morning air
A few hours space permit me here to stay
My steps Eumaeus shall to town convey
With riper beams when Phoebus warms the day

Thus he nor aught Telemachus replied
But left the mansion with a lofty stride
Schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate
Revolving deep the suitors sudden fate
Arriving now before the imperial hall
He props his spear against the pillard wall
Then like a lion oer the threshold bounds
The marble pavement with his steps resounds
His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads
With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds
She saw she wept she ran with eager pace
And reachd her master with a long embrace
All crowded round the family appears
With wild entrancement and ecstatic tears
Swift from above descends the royal fair
Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear
Chastend with coy Dianas pensive air
Hangs oer her son in his embraces dies
Rains kisses on his neck his face his eyes
Few words she spoke though much she had to say
And scarce those few for tears could force their way

Light of my eyes he comes unhopedfor joy
Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy
So snatchd from all our caresTell hast thou known
Thy fathers fate and tell me all thy own

Oh dearest most revered of womankind
Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind
Replied the prince nor be our fates deplored
From death and treason to thy arms restored
Go bathe and robed in white ascend the towers
With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers
To every god vow hecatombs to bleed
And call Joves vengeance on their guilty deed
While to the assembled council I repair
A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there
My new accepted guest I haste to find
Now to Peiraeus honourd charge consignd

The matron heard nor was his word in vain
She bathed and robed in white with all her train
To every god vowd hecatombs to bleed
And calld Joves vengeance on the guilty deed
Armd with his lance the prince then passd the gate
Two dogs behind a faithful guard await
Pallas his form with grace divine improves
The gazing crowd admires him as he moves
Him gathering round the haughty suitors greet
With semblance fair but inward deep deceit
Their false addresses generous he denied
Passd on and sate by faithful Mentors side
With Antiphus and Halitherses sage
His fathers counsellors revered for age
Of his own fortunes and Ulysses fame
Much askd the seniors till Peiraeus came
The strangerguest pursued him close behind
Whom when Telemachus beheld he joind
He when Peiraeus askd for slaves to bring
The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king
Thus thoughtful answerd Those we shall not move
Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove
We know not yet the full event of all
Stabbd in his palace if your prince must fall
Us and our house if treason must oerthrow
Better a friend possess them than a foe
If death to these and vengeance Heaven decree
Riches are welcome then not else to me
Till then retain the giftsThe hero said
And in his hand the willing stranger led
Then disarrayd the shining bath they sought
With unguents smooth of polishd marble wrought
Obedient handmaids with assistant toil
Supply the limpid wave and fragrant oil
Then oer their limbs refulgent robes they threw
And fresh from bathing to their seats withdrew
The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings
Replenishd from the pure translucent springs
With copious streams that golden ewer supplies
A silver layer of capacious size
They wash the table in fair order spread
Is piled with viands and the strength of bread
Full opposite before the folding gate
The pensive mother sits in humble state
Lowly she sate and with dejected view
The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew
The prince and stranger shared the genial feast
Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased

When thus the queen My son my only friend
Say to my mournful couch shall I ascend
The couch deserted now a length of years
The couch for ever waterd with my tears
Say wilt thou not ere yet the suitor crew
Return and riot shakes our walls anew
Say wilt thou not the least account afford
The least glad tidings of my absent lord

To her the youth We reachd the Pylian plains
Where Nestor shepherd of his people reigns
All arts of tenderness to him are known
Kind to Ulysses race as to his own
No father with a fonder grasp of joy
Strains to his bosom his longabsent boy
But all unknown if yet Ulysses breathe
Or glide a spectre in the realms beneath
For farther search his rapid steeds transport
My lengthend journey to the Spartan court
There Argive Helen I beheld whose charms
So Heaven decreed engaged the great in arms
My cause of coming told he thus rejoind
And still his words live perfect in my mind

Heavens would a soft inglorious dastard train
An absent heros nuptial joys profane
So with her young amid the woodland shades
A timorous hind the lions court invades
Leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns
And climbs the cliffs or feeds along the lawns
Meantime returning with remorseless sway
The monarch savage rends the panting prey
With equal fury and with equal fame
Shall great Ulysses reassert his claim
O Jove supreme whom men and gods revere
And thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere
With power congenial joind propitious aid
The chief adopted by the martial maid
Such to our wish the warrior soon restore
As when contending on the Lesbian shore
His prowess Philomelides confessd
And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor blessd
Then soon the invaders of his bed and throne
Their love presumptuous shall by death atone
Now what you question of my ancient friend
With truth I answer thou the truth attend
Learn what I heard the seaborn seer relate
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate
Sole in an isle imprisond by the main
The sad survivor of his numerous train
Ulysses lies detaind by magic charms
And pressd unwilling in Calypsos arms
No sailors there no vessels to convey
No oars to cut the immeasurable way
This told Atrides and he told no more
Then safe I voyaged to my native shore

He ceased nor made the pensive queen reply
But droopd her head and drew a secret sigh
When Theoclymenus the seer began
O suffering consort of the suffering man
What human knowledge could those kings might tell
But I the secrets of high heaven reveal
Before the first of gods be this declared
Before the board whose blessings we have shared
Witness the genial rites and witness all
This house holds sacred in her ample wall
Een now this instant great Ulysses laid
At rest or wandering in his countrys shade
Their guilty deeds in hearing and in view
Secret revolves and plans the vengeance due
Of this sure auguries the gods bestowd
When first our vessel anchord in your road
Succeed those omens Heaven the queen rejoind
So shall our bounties speak a grateful mind
And every envied happiness attend
The man who calls Penelope his friend
Thus communed they while in the marble court
Scene of their insolence the lords resort
Athwart the spacious square each tries his art
To whirl the disk or aim the missile dart
Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive
And from the field the victim flocks they drive
Medon the herald one who pleased them best
And honourd with a portion of their feast
To bid the banquet interrupts their play
Swift to the hall they haste aside they lay
Their garments and succinct the victims slay
Then sheep and goats and bristly porkers bled
And the proud steer was oer the marble spread
While thus the copious banquet they provide
Along the road conversing side by side
Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain
When thus Eumaeus generous and humane
To town observant of our lords behest
Now let us speed my friend no more my guest
Yet like myself I wish thee here preferrd
Guard of the flock or keeper of the herd
But much to raise my masters wrath I fear
The wrath of princes ever is severe
Then heed his will and be our journey made
While the broad beams of Phoebus are displayd
Or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade
Just thy advice the prudent chief rejoind
And such as suits the dictate of my mind
Lead on but help me to some staff to stay
My feeble step since rugged is the way
Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung
Widepatchd and fastend by a twisted thong
A staff Eumaeus gave Along the way
Cheerly they fare behind the keepers stay
These with their watchful dogs a constant guard
Supply his absence and attend the herd
And now his city strikes the monarchs eyes
Alas how changed a man of miseries
Proppd on a staff a beggar old and bare
In rags dishonest fluttering with the air
Now passd the rugged road they journey down
The cavernd way descending to the town
Where from the rock with liquid drops distils
A limpid fount that spread in parting rills
Its current thence to serve the city brings
An useful work adornd by ancient kings
Neritus Ithacus Polyctor there
In sculptured stone immortalized their care
In marble urns received it from above
And shaded with a green surrounding grove
Where silver alders in high arches twined
Drink the cool stream and tremble to the wind
Beneath sequesterd to the nymphs is seen
A mossy altar deep embowerd in green
Where constant vows by travellers are paid
And holy horrors solemnize the shade

Here with his goats not vowd to sacred fame
But pamperd luxury Melanthias came
Two grooms attend him With an envious look
He eyed the stranger and imperious spoke

The good old proverb how this pair fulfil
One rogue is usher to another still
Heaven with a secret principle endued
Mankind to seek their own similitude
Where goes the swineherd with that illlookd guest
That giantglutton dreadful at a feast
Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn
From every great mans gate repulsed with scorn
To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain
Twas but for scraps he askd and askd in vain
To beg than work he better understands
Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands
For any office could the slave be good
To cleanse the fold or help the kids to food
If any labour those big joints could learn
Some whey to wash his bowels he might earn
To cringe to whine his idle hands to spread
Is all by which that graceless maw is fed
Yet hear me if thy impudence but dare
Approach yon wall I prophesy thy fare
Dearly full dearly shalt thou buy thy bread
With many a footstool thundering at thy head

He thus nor insolent of word alone
Spurnd with his rustic heel his king unknown
Spurnd but not moved he like a pillar stood
Nor stirrd an inch contemptuous from the road
Doubtful or with his staff to strike him dead
Or greet the pavement with his worthless head
Short was that doubt to quell his rage inured
The hero stood selfconquerd and endured
But hateful of the wretch Eumaeus heaved
His hands obtesting and this prayer conceived
Daughters of Jove who from the ethereal bowers
Descend to swell the springs and feed the flowers
Nymphs of this fountain to whose sacred names
Our rural victims mount in blazing flames
To whom Ulysses piety preferrd
The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd
Succeed my wish your votary restore
Oh be some god his convoy to our shore
Due pains shall punish then this slaves offence
And humble all his airs of insolence
Who proudly stalking leaves the herds at large
Commences courtier and neglects his charge

What mutters he Melanthius sharp rejoins
This crafty miscreant big with dark designs
The day shall comenay tis already near
When slave to sell thee at a price too dear
Must be my care and hence transport thee oer
A load and scandal to this happy shore
Oh that as surely great Apollos dart
Or some brave suitors sword might pierce the heart
Of the proud son as that we stand this hour
In lasting safety from the fathers power

So spoke the wretch but shunning farther fray
Turnd his proud step and left them on their way
Straight to the feastful palace he repaird
Familiar enterd and the banquet shared
Beneath Eurymachus his patron lord
He took his place and plenty heapd the board

Meantime they heard soft circling in the sky
Sweet airs ascend and heavenly minstrelsy
For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain
Ulysses hearkend then addressd the swain

Well may this palace admiration claim
Great and respondent to the masters fame
Stage above stage the imperial structure stands
Holds the chief honours and the town commands
High walls and battlements the courts inclose
And the strong gates defy a host of foes
Far other cares its dwellers now employ
The throngd assembly and the feast of joy
I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire
And hear what graces every feast the lyre

Then thus Eumaeus Judge we which were best
Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest
Choose you to mingle while behind I stay
Or I first entering introduce the way
Wait for a space without but wait not long
This is the house of violence and wrong
Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear
For like their lawless lords the servants are

Just is O friend thy caution and addressd
Replied the chief to no unheedful breast
The wrongs and injuries of base mankind
Fresh to my sense and always in my mind
The bravelypatient to no fortune yields
On rolling oceans and in fighting fields
Storms have I passd and many a stern debate
And now in humbler scene submit to fate
What cannot want The best she will expose
And I am learnd in all her train of woes
She fills with navies hosts and loud alarms
The sea the land and shakes the world with arms

Thus near the gates conferring as they drew
Argus the dog his ancient master knew
He not unconscious of the voice and tread
Lifts to the sound his ear and rears his head
Bred by Ulysses nourishd at his board
But ah not fated long to please his lord
To him his swiftness and his strength were vain
The voice of glory calld him oer the main
Till then in every sylvan chase renownd
With Argus Argus rung the woods around
With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn
Or traced the mazy leveret oer the lawn
Now left to mans ingratitude he lay
Unhoused neglected in the public way
And where on heaps the rich manure was spread
Obscene with reptiles took his sordid bed

He knew his lord he knew and strove to meet
In vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet
Yet all he could his tail his tears his eyes
Salute his master and confess his joys
Soft pity touchd the mighty masters soul
Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole
Stole unperceived he turnd his head and dried
The drop humane then thus impassiond cried

What noble beast in this abandond state
Lies here all helpless at Ulysses gate
His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise
If as he seems he was in better days
Some care his age deserves or was he prized
For worthless beauty therefore now despised
Such dogs and men there are mere things of state
And always cherishd by their friends the great

Not Argus so Eumaeus thus rejoind
But served a master of a nobler kind
Who never never shall behold him more
Long long since perishd on a distant shore
Oh had you seen him vigorous bold and young
Swift as a stag and as a lion strong
Him no fell savage on the plain withstood
None scaped him bosomd in the gloomy wood
His eye how piercing and his scent how true
To wind the vapour on the tainted dew
Such when Ulysses left his natal coast
Now years unnerve him and his lord is lost
The women keep the generous creature bare
A sleek and idle race is all their care
The master gone the servants what restrains
Or dwells humanity where riot reigns
Jove fixd it certain that whatever day
Makes man a slave takes half his worth away

This said the honest herdsman strode before
The musing monarch pauses at the door
The dog whom Fate had granted to behold
His lord when twenty tedious years had rolld
Takes a last look and having seen him dies
So closed for ever faithful Argus eyes

And now Telemachus the first of all
Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall
Distant he saw across the shady dome
Then gave a sign and beckond him to come
There stood an empty seat where late was placed
In order due the steward of the feast
Who now was busied carving round the board
Eumaeus took and placed it near his lord
Before him instant was the banquet spread
And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread

Next came Ulysses lowly at the door
A figure despicable old and poor
In squalid vests with many a gaping rent
Proppd or a staff and trembling as he went
Then resting on the threshold of the gate
Against a cypress pillar leand his weight
Smoothd by the workman to a polishd plane
The thoughtful son beheld and calld his swain

These viands and this bread Eumaeus bear
And let yon mendicant our plenty share
And let him circle round the suitors board
And try the bounty of each gracious lord
Bold let him ask encouraged thus by me
How ill alas do want and shame agree

His lords command the faithful servant bears
The seeming beggar answers with his prayers
Blessd be Telemachus in every deed
Inspire him Jove in every wish succeed
This said the portion from his son conveyd
With smiles receiving on his scrip he laid
Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire
He fed and ceased when silence held the lyre
Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose
Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes
To tempt their bounties with a suppliants art
And learn the generous from the ignoble heart
Not but his soul resentful as humane
Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train
With speaking eyes and voice of plaintive sound
Humble he moves imploring all around
The proud feel pity and relief bestow
With such an image touchd of human woe
Inquiring all their wonder they confess
And eye the man majestic in distress

While thus they gaze and question with their eyes
The bold Melanthius to their thought replies
My lords this stranger of gigantic port
The good Eumaeus usherd to your court
Full well I markd the features of his face
Though all unknown his clime or noble race

And is this present swineherd of thy band
Bringst thou these vagrants to infest the land
Returns Antinous with retorted eye
Objects uncouth to check the genial joy
Enough of these our court already grace
Of giant stomach and of famishd face
Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings
To share our feast and lead the life of kings

To whom the hospitable swain rejoins
Thy passion prince belies thy knowing mind
Who calls from distant nations to his own
The poor distinguishd by their wants alone
Round the wide world are sought those men divine
Who public structures raise or who design
Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal
Or bless with salutary arts to heal
But chief to poets such respect belongs
By rival nations courted for their songs
These states invite and mighty kings admire
Wide as the sun displays his vital fire
It is not so with want how few that feed
A wretch unhappy merely for his need
Unjust to me and all that serve the state
To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate
For me suffice the approbation won
Of my great mistress and her godlike son

To him Telemachus No more incense
The man by nature prone to insolence
Injurious minds just answers but provoke
Then turning to Antinous thus he spoke
Thanks to thy care whose absolute command
Thus drives the stranger from our court and land
Heaven bless its owner with a better mind
From envy free to charity inclined
This both Penelope and I afford
Then prince be bounteous of Ulysses board
To give anothers is thy hand so slow
So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow

Whence great Telemachus this lofty strain
Antinous cries with insolent disdain
Portions like mine if every suitor gave
Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave

He spoke and lifting high above the board
His ponderous footstool shook it at his lord
The rest with equal hand conferrd the bread
He filld his scrip and to the threshold sped
But first before Antinous stoppd and said
Bestow my friend thou dost not seem the worst
Of all the Greeks but princelike and the first
Then as in dignity be first in worth
And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth
Once I enjoyd in luxury of state
Whateer gives man the envied name of great
Wealth servants friends were mine in better days
And hospitality was then my praise
In every sorrowing soul I pourd delight
And poverty stood smiling in my sight
But Jove allgoverning whose only will
Determines fate and mingles good with ill
Sent me to punish my pursuit of gain
With roving pirates oer the Egyptian main
By Egypts silver flood our ships we moor
Our spies commissiond straight the coast explore
But impotent of mind the lawless will
The country ravage and the natives kill
The spreading clamour to their city flies
And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise
The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields
Horrid with bristly spears and gleaming shields
Jove thunderd on their side our guilty head
We turnd to flight the gathering vengeance spread
On all parts round and heaps on heaps lay dead
Some few the foe in servitude detain
Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain
Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard
And gave to Dmetor Cyprus haughty lord
Hither to scape his chains my course I steer
Still cursed by Fortune and insulted here

To whom Antinous thus his rage expressd
What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest
Unless at distance wretch thou keep behind
Another isle than Cyprus more unkind
Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find
From all thou beggst a bold audacious slave
Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave
Nor wonder I at such profusion shown
Shameless they give who give whats not their own

The chief retiring Souls like that in thee
Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity
Nor will that hand to utmost need afford
The smallest portion of a wasteful board
Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps
Yet starving want amidst the riot weeps

The haughty suitor with resentment burns
And sourly smiling this reply returns
Take that ere yet thou quit this princely throng
And dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue
He said and high the whirling tripod flung
His shoulderblade received the ungentle shock
He stood and moved not like a marble rock
But shook his thoughtful head nor more complaind
Sedate of soul his character sustaind
And inly formd revenge then back withdrew
Before his feet the well filld scrip he threw
And thus with semblance mild addressd the crew

May what I speak your princely minds approve
Ye peers and rivals in this noble love
Not for the hurt I grieve but for the cause
If when the sword our countrys quarrel draws
Or if defending what is justly dear
From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear
The generous motive dignifies the scar
But for mere want how hard to suffer wrong
Want brings enough of other ills along
Yet if injustice never be secure
If fiends revenge and gods assert the poor
Death shall lay low the proud aggressors head
And make the dust Antinous bridal bed

Peace wretch and eat thy bread without offence
The suitor cried or force shall drag thee hence
Scourge through the public street and cast thee there
A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear

His furious deed the general anger moved
All even the worst condemnd and some reproved
Was ever chief for wars like these renownd
Ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound
Unblessd thy hand if in this low disguise
Wander perhaps some inmate of the skies
They curious oft of mortal actions deign
In forms like these to round the earth and main
Just and unjust recording in their mind
And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind

Telemachus absorbd in thought severe
Nourishd deep anguish though he shed no tear
But the dark brow of silent sorrow shook
While thus his mother to her virgins spoke

On him and his may the bright god of day
That base inhospitable blow repay
The nurse replies If Jove receives my prayer
Not one survives to breathe tomorrows air

All all are foes and mischief is their end
Antinous most to gloomy death a friend
Replies the queen the stranger beggd their grace
And melting pity softend every face
From every other hand redress he found
But fell Antinous answerd with a wound
Amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent queen
Then bade Eumaeus call the pilgrim in
Much of the experienced man I long to hear
If or his certain eye or listening ear
Have learnd the fortunes of my wandering lord
Thus she and good Eumaeus took the word

A private audience if thy grace impart
The strangers words may ease the royal heart
His sacred eloquence in balm distils
And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills
Three days have spent their beams three nights have run
Their silent journey since his tale begun
Unfinishd yet and yet I thirst to hear
As when some heaventaught poet charms the ear
Suspending sorrow with celestial strain
Breathed from the gods to soften human pain
Time steals away with unregarded wing
And the soul hears him though he cease to sing

Ulysses late he saw on Cretan ground
His fathers guest for Minos birth renownd
He now but waits the wind to waft him oer
With boundless treasure from Thesprotias shore

To this the queen The wanderer let me hear
While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer
Devour the grazing ox and browsing goat
And turn my generous vintage down their throat
For wheres an arm like thine Ulysses strong
To curb wild riot and to punish wrong

She spoke Telemachus then sneezed aloud
Constraind his nostril echoed through the crowd
The smiling queen the happy omen blessd

So may these impious fall by Fate oppressd
Then to Eumaeus Bring the stranger fly
And if my questions meet a true reply
Graced with a decent robe he shall retire
A gift in season which his wants require

Thus spoke Penelope Eumaeus flies
In duteous haste and to Ulysses cries
The queen invites thee venerable guest
A secret instinct moves her troubled breast
Of her long absent lord from thee to gain
Some light and soothe her souls eternal pain
If true if faithful thou her grateful mind
Of decent robes a present has designd
So finding favour in the royal eye
Thy other wants her subjects shall supply

Fair truth alone the patient man replied
My words shall dictate and my lips shall guide
To him to me one common lot was given
In equal woes alas involved by Heaven
Much of his fates I know but checkd by fear
I stand the hand of violence is here
Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade
And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid
Let for a space the pensive queen attend
Nor claim my story till the sun descend
Then in such robes as suppliants may require
Composed and cheerful by the genial fire
When loud uproar and lawless riot cease
Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace

Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain
And say she cries does fear or shame detain
The cautious stranger With the begging kind
Shame suits but ill Eumaeus thus rejoind

He only asks a more propitious hour
And shuns who would not wicked men in power
At evening mild meet season to confer
By turns to question and by turns to hear

Whoeer this guest the prudent queen replies
His every step and every thought is wise
For men like these on earth he shall not find
In all the miscreant race of human kind
Thus she Eumaeus all her words attends
And parting to the suitor powers descends
There seeks Telemachus and thus apart
In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart

The time my lord invites me to repair
Hence to the lodge my charge demands my care
These sons of murder thirst thy life to take
O guard it guard it for thy servants sake

Thanks to my friend he cries but now the hour
Of night draws on go seek the rural bower
But first refresh and at the dawn of day
Hither a victim to the gods convey
Our life to Heavens immortal powers we trust
Safe in their care for Heaven protects the just

Observant of his voice Eumaeus sate
And fed recumbent on a chair of state
Then instant rose and as he moved along
Twas riot all amid the suitor throng
They feast they dance and raise the mirthful song
Till now declining towards the close of day
The sun obliquely shot his dewy ray



BOOK XVIII

ARGUMENT

THE FIGHT OF ULYSSES AND IRUS

The beggar Irus insults Ulysses the suitors promote the quarrel
in which Irus is worsted and miserably handled Penelope
descends and receives the presents of the suitors The dialogue
of Ulysses with Eurymachus



While fixd in thought the pensive hero sate
A mendicant approachd the royal gate
A surly vagrant of the giant kind
The stain of manhood of a coward mind
From feast to feast insatiate to devour
He flew attendant on the genial hour
Him on his mothers knees when babe he lay
She named Arnaeus on his natal day
But Irus his associates calld the boy
Practised the common messenger to fly
Irus a name expressive of the employ

From his own roof with meditated blows
He strove to drive the man of mighty woes

Hence dotard hence and timely speed thy way
Lest draggd in vengeance thou repent thy stay
See how with nods assent yon princely train
But honouring age in mercy I refrain
In peace away lest if persuasions fail
This arm with blows more eloquent prevail
To whom with stern regard O insolence
Indecently to rail without offence
What bounty gives without a rival share
I ask what harms not thee to breathe this air
Alike on alms we both precarious live
And canst thou envy when the great relieve
Know from the bounteous heavens all riches flow
And what man gives the gods by man bestow
Proud as thou art henceforth no more be proud
Lest I imprint my vengeance in thy blood
Old as I am should once my fury burn
How wouldst thou fly nor een in thought return

Mere womanglutton thus the churl replied
A tongue so flippant with a throat so wide
Why cease I gods to dash those teeth away
Like some wild boars that greedy of his prey
Uproots the bearded corn Rise try the fight
Gird well thy loins approach and feel my might
Sure of defeat before the peers engage
Unequal fight when youth contends with age

Thus in a wordy war their tongues display
More fierce intents preluding to the fray
Antinous hears and in a jovial vein
Thus with loud laughter to the suitor train

This happy day in mirth my friends employ
And lo the gods conspire to crown our joy
See ready for the fight and hand to hand
Yon surly mendicants contentious stand
Why urge we not to blows Well pleased they spring
Swift from their seats and thickening form a ring

To whom Antinous Lo enrichd with blood
A kids wellfatted entrails tasteful food
On glowing embers lie on him bestow
The choicest portion who subdues his foe
Grant him unrivalld in these walls to stay
The sole attendant on the genial day

The lords applaud Ulysses then with art
And fears wellfeignd disguised his dauntless heart

Worn as I am with age decayd with woe
Say is it baseness to decline the foe
Hard conflict when calamity and age
With vigorous youth unknown to cares engage
Yet fearful of disgrace to try the day
Imperious hunger bids and I obey
But swear impartial arbiters of right
Swear to stand neutral while we cope in fight

The peers assent when straight his sacred head
Telemachus upraised and sternly said
Stranger if prompted to chastise the wrong
Of this bold insolent confide be strong
The injurious Greek that dares attempt a blow
That instant makes Telemachus his foe
And these my friends shall guard the sacred ties
Of hospitality for they are wise

Then girding his strong loins the king prepares
To close in combat and his body bares
Broad spread his shoulders and his nervous thighs
By just degrees like wellturnd columns rise
Ample his chest his arms are round and long
And each strong joint Minerva knits more strong
Attendant on her chief the suitorcrowd
With wonder gaze and gazing speak aloud
Irus alas shall Irus be no more
Black fate impends and this the avenging hour
Gods how his nerves a matchless strength proclaim
Swell oer his wellstrong limbs and brace his frame

Then pale with fears and sickening at the sight
They draggd the unwilling Irus to the fight
From his blank visage fled the coward blood
And his flesh trembled as aghast he stood

O that such baseness should disgrace the light
O hide it death in everlasting night
Exclaims Antinous can a vigorous foe
Meanly decline to combat age and woe
But hear me wretch if recreant in the fray
That huge bulk yield this illcontested day
Instant thou sailst to Eschetus resignd
A tyrant fiercest of the tyrant kind
Who casts thy mangled ears and nose a prey
To hungry dogs and lops the man away

While with indignant scorn he sternly spoke
In every joint the trembling Irus shook
Now front to front each frowning champion stands
And poises high in air his adverse hands
The chief yet doubts or to the shades below
To fell the giant at one vengeful blow
Or save his life and soon his life to save
The king resolves for mercy sways the brave
That instant Irus his huge arm extends
Full on his shoulder the rude weight descends
The sage Ulysses fearful to disclose
The hero latent in the man of woes
Checkd half his might yet rising to the stroke
His jawbone dashd the crashing jawbone broke
Down droppd he stupid from the stunning wound
His feet extended quivering beat the ground
His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood
His teeth all shatterd rush inmixd with blood

The peers transported as outstretchd he lies
With bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies
Then draggd along all bleeding from the wound
His length of carcase trailing prints the ground
Raised on his feet again he reels he falls
Till proppd reclining on the palace walls
Then to his hand a staff the victor gave
And thus with just reproach addressd the slave
There terrible affright with dogs and reign
A dreaded tyrant oer the bestial train
But mercy to the poor and stranger show
Lest Heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe

Scornful he spoke and oer his shoulder flung
The broadpatchd scrip in tatters hung
Ill joind and knotted to a twisted thong
Then turning short disdaind a further stay
But to the palace measured back the way
There as he rested gathering in a ring
The peers with smiles addressd their unknown king
Stranger may Jove and all the aerial powers
With every blessing crown thy happy hours
Our freedom to thy prowessd arm we owe
From bold intrusion of thy coward foe
Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing
To Eschetus the monster of a king

While pleased he hears Antinous bears the food
A kids wellfatted entrails rich with blood
The bread from canisters of shining mould
Amphinomus and wines that laugh in gold
And oh he mildly cries may Heaven display
A beam of glory oer thy future day
Alas the brave too oft is doomd to bear
The gripes of poverty and stings of care

To whom with thought mature the king replies
The tongue speaks wisely when the soul is wise
Such was thy father in imperial state
Great without vice that oft attends the great
Nor from the sire art thou the son declind
Then hear my words and grace them in thy mind
Of all that breathes or grovelling creeps on earth
Most man in vain calamitous by birth
Today with power elate in strength he blooms
The haughty creature on that power presumes
Anon from Heaven a sad reverse he feels
Untaught to bear gainst Heaven the wretch rebels
For man is changeful as his bliss or woe
Too high when prosperous when distressd too low
There was a day when with the scornful great
I swelld in pomp and arrogance of state
Proud of the power that to high birth belongs
And used that power to justify my wrongs
Then let not man be proud but firm of mind
Bear the best humbly and the worst resignd
Be dumb when Heaven afflicts unlike yon train
Of haughty spoilers insolently vain
Who make their queen and all her wealth a prey
But vengeance and Ulysses wing their way
O mayst thou favourd by some guardian power
Far far be distant in that deathful hour
For sure I am if stern Ulysses breathe
These lawless riots end in blood and death

Then to the gods the rosy juice he pours
And the draind goblet to the chief restores
Stung to the soul oercast with holy dread
He shook the graceful honours of his head
His boding mind the future woe forestalls
In vain by great Telemachus he falls
For Pallas seals his doom all sad he turns
To join the peers resumes his throne and mourns

Meanwhile Minerva with instinctive fires
Thy soul Penelope from Heaven inspires
With flattering hopes the suitors to betray
And seem to meet yet fly the bridal day
Thy husbands wonder and thy sons to raise
And crown the mother and the wife with praise
Then while the streaming sorrow dims her eyes
Thus with a transient smile the matron cries

Eurynome to go where riot reigns
I feel an impulse though my soul disdains
To my loved son the snares of death to show
And in the traitor friend unmask the foe
Who smooth of tongue in purpose insincere
Hides fraud in smiles while death is ambushd there

Go warn thy son nor be the warning vain
Replied the sagest of the royal train
But bathed anointed and adornd descend
Powerful of charms bid every grace attend
The tide of flowing tears awhile suppress
Tears but indulge the sorrow not repress
Some joy remains to thee a son is given
Such as in fondness parents ask of Heaven

Ah me forbear returns the queen forbear
Oh talk not talk not of vain beautys care
No more I bathe since he no longer sees
Those charms for whom alone I wish to please
The day that bore Ulysses from this coast
Blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast
But instant bid Autonoe descend
Instant Hippodame our steps attend
Ill suits it female virtue to be seen
Alone indecent in the walks of men

Then while Eurynome the mandate bears
From heaven Minerva shoots with guardian cares
Oer all her senses as the couch she pressd
She pours a pleasing deep and deathlike rest
With every beauty every feature arms
Bids her cheeks glow and lights up all her charms
In her lovedarting eyes awakes the fires
Immortal gifts to kindle soft desires
From limb to limb an air majestic sheds
And the pure ivory oer her bosom spreads
Such Venus shines when with a measured bound
She smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round
When with the Graces in the dance she moves
And fires the gazing gods with ardent loves

Then to the skies her flight Minerva bends
And to the queen the damsel train descends
Waked at their steps her flowing eyes unclose
The tears she wipes and thus renews her woes
Howeer tis well that sleep awhile can free
With soft forgetfulness a wretch like me
Oh were it given to yield this transient breath
Send O Diana send the sleep of death
Why must I waste a tedious life in tears
Nor bury in the silent grave my cares
O my Ulysses ever honourd name
For thee I mourn till death dissolves my frame

Thus wailing slow and sadly she descends
On either band a damsel train attends
Full where the dome its shining valves expands
Radiant before the gazing peers she stands
A veil translucent oer her brow displayd
Her beauty seems and only seems to shade
Sudden she lightens in their dazzled eyes
And sudden flames in every bosom rise
They send their eager souls with every look
Till silence thus the imperial matron broke

O why my son why now no more appears
That warmth of soul that urged thy younger years
Thy riper days no growing worth impart
A man in stature still a boy in heart
Thy wellknit frame unprofitably strong
Speaks thee a hero from a hero sprung
But the just gods in vain those gifts bestow
O wise alone in form and grave in show
Heavens could a stranger feel oppressions hand
Beneath thy roof and couldst thou tamely stand
If thou the strangers righteous cause decline
His is the sufferance but the shame is thine

To whom with filial awe the prince returns
That generous soul with just resentment burns
Yet taught by time my heart has learnd to glow
For others good and melt at others woe
But impotent those riots to repel
I bear their outrage though my soul rebel
Helpless amid the snares of death I tread
And numbers leagued in impious union dread
But now no crime is theirs this wrong proceeds
From Irus and the guilty Irus bleeds
Oh would to Jove or her whose arms display
The shield of Jove or him who rules the day
That yon proud suitors who licentious tread
These courts within these courts like Irus bled
Whose loose head tottering as with wine oppressd
Obliquely drops and nodding knocks his breast
Powerless to move his staggering feet deny
The coward wretch the privilege to fly

Then to the queen Eurymachus replies
O justly loved and not more fair than wise
Should Greece through all her hundred states survey
Thy finishd charms all Greece would own thy sway
In rival crowds contest the glorious prize
Dispeopling realms to gaze upon thy eyes
O woman loveliest of the lovely kind
In body perfect and complete in mind

Ah me returns the queen when from this shore
Ulysses saild then beauty was no more
The gods decreed these eyes no more should keep
Their wonted grace but only serve to weep
Should he return whateer my beauties prove
My virtues last my brightest charm is love
Now grief thou all art mine the gods oercast
My soul with woes that long ah long must last
Too faithfully my heart retains the day
That sadly tore my royal lord away
He graspd my hand and O my spouse I leave
Thy arms he cried perhaps to find a grave
Fame speaks the Trojans bold they boast the skill
To give the featherd arrow wings to kill
To dart the spear and guide the rushing car
With dreadful inroad through the walks of war
My sentence is gone forth and tis decreed
Perhaps by righteous Heaven that I must bleed
My father mother all I trust to three
To them to them transfer the love of me
But when my son grows man the royal sway
Resign and happy be thy bridal day
Such were his words and Hymen now prepares
To light his torch and give me up to cares
The afflictive hand of wrathful Jove to bear
A wretch the most complete that breathes the air
Falln een below the rights to woman due
Careless to please with insolence ye woo
The generous lovers studious to succeed
Bid their whole herds and flocks in banquets bleed
By precious gifts the vow sincere display
You only you make her ye love your prey

Wellpleased Ulysses hears his queen deceive
The suitortrain and raise a thirst to give
False hopes she kindles but those hopes betray
And promise yet elude the bridal day

While yet she speaks the gay Antinous cries
Offspring of kings and more than woman wise
Tis right tis mans prerogative to give
And custom bids thee without shame receive
Yet never never from thy dome we move
Till Hymen lights the torch of spousal love

The peers despatchd their heralds to convey
The gifts of love with speed they take the way
A robe Antinous gives of shining dyes
The varying hues in gay confusion rise
Rich from the artists hand Twelve clasps of gold
Close to the lessening waist the vest infold
Down from the swelling loins the vest unbound
Floats in bright waves redundant oer the ground
A bracelet rich with gold with amber gay
That shot effulgence like the solar ray
Eurymachus presents and earrings bright
With triple stars that casts a trembling light
Pisander bears a necklace wrought with art
And every peer expressive of his heart
A gift bestows this done the queen ascends
And slow behind her damsel train attends

Then to the dance they form the vocal strain
Till Hesperus leads forth the starry train
And now he raises as the daylight fades
His golden circlet in the deepening shades
Three vases heapd with copious fires display
Oer all the palace a fictitious day
From space to space the torch widebeaming burns
And sprightly damsels trim the rays by turns

To whom the king Ill suits your sex to stay
Alone with men ye modest maids away
Go with the queen the spindle guide or cull
The partners of her cares the silver wool
Be it my task the torches to supply
Een till the morning lamp adorns the sky
Een till the morning with unwearied care
Sleepless I watch for I have learnd to bear

Scornful they heard Melantho fair and young
Melantho from the loins of Dolius sprung
Who with the queen her years an infant led
With the soft fondness of a daughter bred
Chiefly derides regardless of the cares
Her queen endures polluted joys she shares
Nocturnal with Eurymachus with eyes
That speak disdain the wanton thus replies
Oh whither wanders thy distemperd brain
Thou bold intruder on a princely train
Hence to the vagrants rendezvous repair
Or shun in some black forge the midnight air
Proceeds this boldness from a turn of soul
Or flows licentious from the copious bowl
Is it that vanquishd Irus swells thy mind
A foe may meet thee of a braver kind
Who shortening with a storm of blows thy stay
Shall send thee howling all in blood away

To whom with frowns O impudent in wrong
Thy lord shall curb that insolence of tongue
Know to Telemachus I tell the offence
The scourge the scourge shall lash thee into sense

With conscious shame they hear the stern rebuke
Nor longer durst sustain the sovereign look

Then to the servile task the monarch turns
His royal hands each torch refulgent burns
With added day meanwhile in museful mood
Absorbd in thought on vengeance fixd he stood
And now the martial maid by deeper wrongs
To rouse Ulysses points the suitors tongues
Scornful of age to taunt the virtuous man
Thoughtless and gay Eurymachus began

Hear me he cries confederates and friends
Some god no doubt this stranger kindly sends
The shining baldness of his head survey
It aids our torchlight and reflects the ray

Then to the king that levelld haughty Troy
Say if large hire can tempt thee to employ
Those hands in work to tend the rural trade
To dress the walk and form the embowering shade
So food and raiment constant will I give
But idly thus thy soul prefers to live
And starve by strolling not by work to thrive

To whom incensed Should we O prince engage
In rival tasks beneath the burning rage
Of summer suns were both constraind to wield
Foodless the scythe along the burdend field
Or should we labour while the ploughshare wounds
With steers of equal strength the allotted grounds
Beneath my labours how thy wondering eyes
Might see the sable field at once arise
Should Jove dire war unloose with spear and shield
And nodding helm I tread the ensanguined field
Fierce in the van then wouldst thou wouldst thousay
Misname me glutton in that glorious day
No thy illjudging thoughts the brave disgrace
Tis thou injurious art not I am base
Proud to seem brave among a coward train
But now thou art not valorous but vain
God should the stern Ulysses rise in might
These gates would seem too narrow for thy flight

While yet he speaks Eurymachus replies
With indignation flashing from his eyes

Slave I with justice might deserve the wrong
Should I not punish that opprobrious tongue
Irreverent to the great and uncontrolld
Art thou from wine or innate folly bold
Perhaps these outrages from Irus flow
A worthless triumph oer a worthless foe

He said and with full force a footstool threw
Whirld from his arm with erring rage it flew
Ulysses cautious of the vengeful foe
Stoops to the ground and disappoints the blow
Not so a youth who deals the goblet round
Full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound
Dashd from his hand the sounding goblet flies
He shrieks he reels he falls and breathless lies
Then wild uproar and clamour mount the sky
Till mutual thus the peers indignant cry
Oh had this stranger sunk to realms beneath
To the black realms of darkness and of death
Ere yet he trod these shores to strife he draws
Peer against peer and what the weighty cause
A vagabond for him the great destroy
In vile ignoble jars the feast of joy

To whom the stern Telemachus uprose
Gods what wild folly from the goblet flows
Whence this unguarded openness of soul
But from the license of the copious bowl
Or Heaven delusion sends but hence away
Force I forbear and without force obey

Silent abashd they hear the stern rebuke
Till thus Amphinomus the silence broke

True are his words and he whom truth offends
Not with Telemachus but truth contends
Let not the hand of violence invade
The reverend stranger or the spotless maid
Retire we hence but crown with rosy wine
The flowing goblet to the powers divine
Guard he his guest beneath whose roof he stands
This justice this the social rite demands

The peers assent the goblet Mulius crownd
With purple juice and bore in order round
Each peer successive his libation pours
To the blest gods who filld the ethereal bowers
Then swilld with wine with noise the crowds obey
And rushing forth tumultuous reel away



BOOK XIX

ARGUMENT

THE DISCOVERY OF ULYSSES TO EURYCLEA

Ulysses and his son remove the weapons out of the armoury
Ulysses in conversation with Penelope gives a fictitious account
of his adventures then assures her he had formerly entertained
her husband in Crete and describes exactly his person and dress
affirms to have heard of him in Phaeacia and Thesprotia and that
his return is certain and within a month He then goes to bathe
and is attended by Euryclea who discovers him to be Ulysses by
the scar upon his leg which he formerly received in hunting the
wild boar on Parnassus The poet inserts a digression relating
that accident with all its particulars



Consulting secret with the blueeyed maid
Still in the dome divine Ulysses stayd
Revenge mature for act inflamed his breast
And thus the son the fervent sire addressd

Instant convey those steely stores of war
To distant rooms disposed with secret care
The cause demanded by the suitortrain
To soothe their fears a specious reason feign
Say since Ulysses left his natal coast
Obscene with smoke their beamy lustre lost
His arms deform the roof they wont adorn
From the glad walls inglorious lumber torn
Suggest that Jove the peaceful thought inspired
Lest they by sight of swords to fury fired
Dishonest wounds or violence of soul
Defame the bridal feast and friendly bowl

The prince obedient to the sage command
To Euryclea thus The female band
In their apartments keep secure the doors
These swarthy arms among the covert stores
Are seemlier hid my thoughtless youth they blame
Imbrownd with vapour of the smouldering flame

In happier hour pleased Euryclea cries
Tutourd by early woes grow early wise
Inspect with sharpend sight and frugal care
Your patrimonial wealth a prudent heir
But who the lighted taper will provide
The female train retired your toils to guide

Without infringing hospitable right
This guest he cried shall bear the guiding light
I cheer no lazy vagrants with repast
They share the meal that earn it ere they taste

He said from female ken she straight secures
The purposed deed and guards the bolted doors
Auxiliar to his son Ulysses bears
The plumycrested helms and pointed spears
With shields indented deep in glorious wars
Minerva viewless on her charge attends
And with her golden lamp his toil befriends
Not such the sickly beams which unsincere
Gild the gross vapour of this nether sphere
A present deity the prince confessd
And wrappd with ecstasy the sire addressd

What miracle thus dazzles with surprise
Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise
The walls whereer my wondering sight I turn
And roofs amidst a blaze of glory burn
Some visitant of pure ethereal race
With his bright presence deigns the dome to grace

Be calm replies the sire to none impart
But oft revolve the vision in thy heart
Celestials mantled in excess of light
Can visit unapproachd by mortal sight
Seek thou repose whilst here I sole remain
To explore the conduct of the female train
The pensive queen perchance desires to know
The series of my toils to soothe her woe

With tapers flaming day his train attends
His bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends
Soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close
Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows

Whilst forming plans of death Ulysses stayd
In counsel secret with the martial maid
Attendant nymphs in beauteous order wait
The queen descending from her bower of state
Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear
Chastend with coy Dianas pensive air
An ivory seat with silver ringlets graced
By famed Icmalius wrought the menials placed
With ivory silverd thick the footstool shone
Oer which the panthers various hide was thrown
The sovereign seat with graceful air she pressd
To different tasks their toil the nymphs addressd
The golden goblets some and some restored
From stains of luxury the polishd board
These to remove the expiring embers came
While those with unctuous fir foment the flame

Twas then Melantho with imperious mien
Renewd the attack incontinent of spleen
Avaunt she cried offensive to my sight
Deem not in ambush here to lurk by night
Into the womanstate asquint to pry
A daydevourer and an evening spy
Vagrant begone before this blazing brand
Shall urgeand waved it hissing in her hand

The insulted hero rolls his wrathful eyes
And Why so turbulent of soul he cries
Can these lean shrivelld limbs unnerved with age
These poor but honest rags enkindle rage
In crowds we wear the badge of hungry fate
And beg degraded from superior state
Constraind a rentcharge on the rich I live
Reduced to crave the good I once could give
A palace wealth and slaves I late possessd
And all that makes the great be calld the blessd
My gate an emblem of my open soul
Embraced the poor and dealt a bounteous dole
Scorn not the sad reverse injurious maid
Tis Joves high will and be his will obeyd
Nor think thyself exempt that rosy prime
Must share the general doom of withering time
To some new channel soon the changeful tide
Of royal grace the offended queen may guide
And her loved lord unplume thy towering pride
Or were he dead tis wisdom to beware
Sweet blooms the prince beneath Apollos care
Your deeds with quick impartial eye surveys
Potent to punish what he cannot praise

Her keen reproach had reachd the sovereigns ear
Loquacious insolent she cries forbear
To thee the purpose of my soul I told
Venial discourse unblamed with him to hold
The storied labours of my wandering lord
To soothe my grief he haply may record
Yet him my guest thy venomd rage hath stung
Thy head shall pay the forfeit of thy tongue
But thou on whom my palace cares depend
Eurynome regard the strangerfriend
A seat soft spread with furry spoils prepare
Duedistant for us both to speak and hear

The menial fair obeys with duteous haste
A seat adornd with furry spoils she placed
Duedistant for discourse the hero sate
When thus the sovereign from her chair of state

Reveal obsequious to my first demand
Thy name thy lineage and thy natal land

He thus O queen whose farresounding fame
Is bounded only by the starry frame
Consummate pattern of imperial sway
Whose pious rule a warlike race obey
In wavy gold thy summer vales are dressd
Thy autumns bind with copious fruit oppressd
With flocks and herds each grassy plain is stored
And fish of every fin thy seas afford
Their affluent joys the grateful realms confess
And bless the power that still delights to bless
Gracious permit this prayer imperial dame
Forbear to know my lineage or my name
Urge not this breast to heave these eyes to weep
In sweet oblivion let my sorrows sleep
My woes awaked will violate your ear
And to this gay censorious train appear
A whiny vapour melting in a tear

Their gifts the gods resumed the queen rejoind
Exterior grace and energy of mind
When the dear partner of my nuptial joy
Auxiliar troops combined to conquer Troy
My lords protecting hand alone would raise
My drooping verdure and extend my praise
Peers from the distant Samian shore resort
Here with Dulichians joind besiege the court
Zacynthus green with evershady groves
And Ithaca presumptuous boast their loves
Obtruding on my choice a second lord
They press the Hymenaean rite abhorrd
Misrule thus mingling with domestic cares
I live regardless of my state affairs
Receive no strangerguest no poor relieve
But ever for my lord in secret grieve
This art instinct by some celestial power
I tried elusive of the bridal hour

Ye peers I cry who press to gain a heart
Where dead Ulysses claims no future part
Rebate your loves each rival suit suspend
Till this funeral web my labours end
Cease till to good Laertes I bequeath
A pall of state the ornament of death
For when to fate he bows each Grecian dame
With just reproach were licensed to defame
Should he long honourd in supreme command
Want the last duties of a daughters hand
The fiction pleased their loves I long elude
The night still ravelld what the day renewd
Three years successful in my heart conceald
My ineffectual fraud the fourth reveald
Befriended by my own domestic spies
The woof unwrought the suitortrain surprise
From nuptial rites they now no more recede
And fear forbids to falsify the brede
My anxious parents urge a speedy choice
And to their suffrage gain the filial voice
For rule mature Telemachus deplores
His dome dishonourd and exhausted stores
But stranger as thy days seem full of fate
Divide discourse in turn thy birth relate
Thy port asserts thee of distinguishd race
No poor unfatherd product of disgrace

Princess he cries renewd by your command
The dear remembrance of my native land
Of secret grief unseals the fruitful source
Fond tears repeat their longforgotten course
So pays the wretch whom fate constrains to roam
The dues of nature to his natal home
But inward on my soul let sorrow prey
Your sovereign will my duty bids obey

Crete awes the circling waves a fruitful soil
And ninety cities crown the seaborn isle
Mixd with her genuine sons adopted names
In various tongues avow their various claims
Cydonians dreadful with the bended yew
And bold Pelasgi boast a natives due
The Dorians plumed amid the files of war
Her foodful glebe with fierce Achaians share
Cnossus her capital of high command
Where sceptred Minos with impartial hand
Divided right each ninth revolving year
By Jove received in council to confer
His son Deucalion bore successive sway
His son who gave me first to view the day
The royal bed an elder issue blessd
Idomeneus whom Ilion fields attest
Of matchless deeds untraind to martial toil
I lived inglorious in my native isle
Studious of peace and Aethon is my name
Twas then to Crete the great Ulysses came
For elemental war and wintry Jove
From Maleas gusty cape his navy drove
To bright Lucinas fane the shelfy coast
Where loud Amnisus in the deep is lost
His vessels moord an incommodious port
The hero speeded to the Cnossian court
Ardent the partner of his arms to find
In leagues of long commutual friendship joind
Vain hope ten suns had warmd the western strand
Since my brave brother with his Cretan band
Had saild for Troy but to the genial feast
My honourd roof received the royal guest
Beeves for his train the Cnossian peers assign
A public treat with jars of generous wine
Twelve days while Boreas vexd the aerial space
My hospitable dome he deignd to grace
And when the north had ceased the stormy roar
He wingd his voyage to the Phrygian shore

Thus the famd hero perfected in wiles
With fair similitude of truth beguiles
The queens attentive ear dissolved in woe
From her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow
As snows collected on the mountain freeze
When milder regions breathe a vernal breeze
The fleecy pile obeys the whispering gales
Ends in a stream and murmurs through the vales
So melting with the pleasing tale he told
Down her fair cheek the copious torrent rolld
She to her present lord laments him lost
And views that object which she wants the most
Withering at heart to see the weeping fair
His eyes look stern and cast a gloomy stare
Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear
Or globes of iron fixd in either sphere
Firm wisdom interdicts the softening tear
A speechless interval of grief ensues
Till thus the queen the tender theme renews

Stranger that eer thy hospitable roof
Ulysses graced confirm by faithful proof
Delineate to my view my warlike lord
His form his habit and his train record

Tis hard he cries to bring to sudden sight
Ideas that have wingd their distant flight
Rare on the mind those images are traced
Whose footsteps twenty winters have defaced
But what I can receiveIn ample mode
A robe of military purple flowd
Oer all his frame illustrious on his breast
The doubleclasping gold the king confessd
In the rich woof a hound mosaic drawn
Bore on full stretch and seized a dappled fawn
Deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold
They pant and struggle in the moving gold
Fine as a filmy web beneath it shone
A vest that dazzled like a cloudless sun
The female train who round him throngd to gaze
In silent wonder sighd unwilling praise
A sabre when the warrior pressd to part
I gave enamelld with Vulcanian art
A mantle purpletinged and radiant vest
Dimensiond equal to his size expressd
Affection grateful to my honourd guest
A favourite herald in his train I knew
His visage solemn sad of sable hue
Short woolly curls oerfleeced his bending head
Oer which a promontory shoulder spread
Eurybates in whose large soul alone
Ulysses viewd an image of his own

His speech the tempest of her grief restored
In all he told she recognized her lord
But when the storm was spent in plenteous showers
A pause inspiriting her languishd powers
O thou she cried whom first inclement Fate
Made welcome to my hospitable gate
With all thy wants the name of poor shall end
Henceforth live honourd my domestic friend
The vest much envied on your native coast
And regal robe with figured gold embossd
In happier hours my artful hand employd
When my loved lord this blissful bower enjoyd
The fall of Troy erroneous and forlorn
Doomd to survive and never to return

Then he with pity touchd O royal dame
Your everanxious mind and beauteous frame
From the devouring rage of grief reclaim
I not the fondness of your soul reprove
For such a lord who crownd your virgin love
With the dear blessing of a fair increase
Himself adornd with more than mortal grace
Yet while I speak the mighty woe suspend
Truth forms my tale to pleasing truth attend
The royal object of your dearest care
Breathes in no distant clime the vital air
In rich Thesprotia and the nearer bound
Of Thessaly his name I heard renownd
Without retinue to that friendly shore
Welcomed with gifts of price a sumless store
His sacrilegious train who dared to prey
On herds devoted to the god of day
Were doomd by Jove and Phoebus just decree
To perish in the rough Trinacrian sea
To better fate the blameless chief ordaind
A floating fragment of the wreck regaind
And rode the storm till by the billows tossd
He landed on the fair Phaeacian coast
That race who emulate the life of gods
Receive him joyous to their blessd abodes
Large gifts confer a ready sail command
To speed his voyage to the Grecian strand
But your wise lord in whose capacious soul
High schemes of power in just succession roll
His Ithaca refused from favouring Fate
Till copious wealth might guard his regal state
Phedon the fact affirmd whose sovereign sway
Thesprotian tribes a duteous race obey
And bade the gods this added truth attest
While pure libations crownd the genial feast
That anchord in his port the vessels stand
To waft the hero to his natal land
I for Dulichium urge the watery way
But first the Ulyssean wealth survey
So rich the value of a store so vast
Demands the pomp of centuries to waste
The darling object of your royal love
Was journeyd thence to Dodonean Jove
By the sure precept of the sylvan shrine
To form the conduct of his great design
Irresolute of soul his state to shroud
In dark disguise or come a king avowd
Thus lives your lord nor longer doomd to roam
Soon will he grace this dear paternal dome
By Jove the source of good supreme in power
By the blessd genius of this friendly bower
I ratify my speech before the sun
His annual longitude of heaven shall run
When the pale empress of yon starry train
In the next month renews her faded wane
Ulysses will assert his rightful reign

What thanks what boon replied the queen are due
When time shall prove the storied blessing true
My lords return should fate no more retard
Envy shall sicken at thy vast reward
But my prophetic fears alas presage
The wounds of Destinys relentless rage
I long must weep nor will Ulysses come
With royal gifts to send you honourd home
Your other task ye menial train forbear
Now wash the stranger and the bed prepare
With splendid palls the downy fleece adorn
Uprising early with the purple morn
His sinews shrunk with age and stiff with toil
In the warm bath foment with fragrant oil
Then with Telemachus the social feast
Partaking free my soul invited guest
Whoeer neglects to pay distinction due
The breach of hospitable right may rue
The vulgar of my sex I most exceed
In real fame when most humane my deed
And vainly to the praise of queen aspire
If stranger I permit that mean attire
Beneath the feastful bower A narrow space
Confines the circle of our destind race
Tis ours with good the scanty round to grace
Those who to cruel wrong their state abuse
Dreaded in life the mutterd curse pursues
By death disrobed of all their savage powers
Then licensed rage her hateful prey devours
But he whose inborn worth his acts commend
Of gentle soul to human race a friend
The wretched he relieves diffuse his fame
And distant tongues extol the patronname

Princess he cried in vain your bounties flow
On me confirmd and obstinate in woe
When my loved Crete received my final view
And from my weeping eyes her cliffs withdrew
These tatterd weeds my decent robes resignd
I chose the livery of a woful mind
Nor will my heartcorroding care abate
With splendid palls and canopies of state
Lowcouchd on earth the gift of sleep I scorn
And catch the glances of the waking morn
The delicacy of your courtly train
To wash a wretched wanderer would disdain
But if in tract of long experience tried
And sad similitude of woes allied
Some wretch reluctant views aerial light
To her mean hand assign the friendly rite

Pleased with his wise reply the queen rejoind
Such gentle manners and so sage a mind
In all who graced this hospitable bower
I neer discerned before this social hour
Such servant as your humble choice requires
To light received the lord of my desires
New from the birth and with a mothers hand
His tender bloom to manly growth sustaind
Of matchless prudence and a duteous mind
Though now to lifes extremest verge declined
Of strength superior to the toil designd
Rise Euryclea with officious care
For the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare
This debt his correspondent fortunes claim
Too like Ulysses and perhaps the same
Thus old with woes my fancy paints him now
For age untimely marks the careful brow

Instant obsequious to the mild command
Sad Euryclea rose with trembling hand
She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes
And thus impassiond to herself replies

Son of my love and monarch of my cares
What pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears
Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid
With pious deed and pure devotion paid
He never dared defraud the sacred fane
Of perfect hecatombs in order slain
There oft implored his tutelary power
Long to protract the sad sepulchral hour
That formd for empire with paternal care
His realm might recognize an equal heir
O destined head The pious vows are lost
His God forgets him on a foreign coast
Perhaps like thee poor guest in wanton pride
The rich insult him and the young deride
Conscious of worth reviled thy generous mind
The friendly rite of purity declined
My will concurring with my queens command
Accept the bath from this obsequious hand
A strong emotion shakes my anguishd breast
In thy whole form Ulysses seems expressd
Of all the wretched harboured on our coast
None imaged eer like thee my master lost

Thus halfdiscoverd through the dark disguise
With cool composure feignd the chief replies
You join your suffrage to the public vote
The same you think have all beholders thought

He said replenishd from the purest springs
The laver straight with busy care she brings
In the deep vase that shone like burnishd gold
The boiling fluid temperates the cold
Meantime revolving in his thoughtful mind
The scar with which his manly knee was signd
His face averting from the crackling blaze
His shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays
Thus cautious in the obscure he hoped to fly
The curious search of Eurycleas eye
Cautious in vain nor ceased the dame to find
This scar with which his manly knee was signd

This on Parnassus combating the boar
With glancing rage the tusky savage tore
Attended by his brave maternal race
His grandsire sent him to the sylvan chase
Autolycus the bold a mighty name
For spotless faith and deeds of martial fame
Hermes his patron god those gifts bestowd
Whose shrine with weanling lambs he wont to load
His course to Ithaca this hero sped
When the first product of Laertes bed
Was now disclosed to birth the banquet ends
When Euryclea from the queen descends
And to his fond embrace the babe commends
Receive she cries your royal daughters son
And name the blessing that your prayers have won
Then thus the hoary chief My victor arms
Have awed the realms around with dire alarms
A sure memorial of my dreaded fame
The boy shall bear Ulysses be his name
And when with filial love the youth shall come
To view his mothers soil my Delphic dome
With gifts of price shall send him joyous home
Lured with the promised boon when youthful prime
Ended in man his mothers natal clime
Ulysses sought with fond affection dear
Amphiteas arms received the royal heir
Her ancient lord an equal joy possessd
Instant he bade prepare the genial feast
A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled
Whose stately growth five flowery summers fed
His sons divide and roast with artful care
The limbs then all the tasteful viands share
Nor ceased discourse the banquet of the soul
Till Phoebus wheeling to the western goal
Resignd the skies and night involved the pole
Their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppressd
Sated they rose and all retired to rest

Soon as the morn newrobed in purple light
Pierced with her golden shafts the rear of night
Ulysses and his brave maternal race
The young Autolyci essay the chase
Parnassus thick perplexd with horrid shades
With deepmouthd hounds the huntertroop invades
What time the sun from oceans peaceful stream
Darts oer the lawn his horizontal beam
The pack impatient snuff the tainted gale
The thorny wilds the woodmen fierce assail
And foremost of the train his cornel spear
Ulysses waved to rouse the savage war
Deep in the rough recesses of the wood
A lofty copse the growth of ages stood
Nor winters boreal blast nor thunderous shower
Nor solar ray could pierce the shady bower
With witherd foliage strewd a heapy store
The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar
Roused by the hounds and hunters mingling cries
The savage from his leafy shelter flies
With fiery glare his sanguine eyeballs shine
And bristles high impale his horrid chine
Young Ithacus advanced defies the foe
Poising his lifted lance in act to throw
The savage renders vain the wound decreed
And springs impetuous with opponent speed
His tusks oblique he aimd the knee to gore
Aslope they glanced the sinewy fibres tore
And bared the bone Ulysses undismayd
Soon with redoubled force the wound repaid
To the right shoulderjoint the spear applied
His further flank with streaming purple dyed
On earth he rushed with agonizing pain
With joy and vast surprise the applauding train
Viewd his enormous bulk extended on the plain
With bandage firm Ulysses knee they bound
Then chanting mystic lays the closing wound
Of sacred melody confessd the force
The tides of life regaind their azure course
Then back they led the youth with loud acclaim
Autolycus enamoured with his fame
Confirmd the cure and from the Delphic dome
With added gifts returnd him glorious home
He safe at Ithaca with joy received
Relates the chase and early praise achieved

Deep oer his knee inseamd remaind the scar
Which noted token of the woodland war
When Euryclea found the ablution ceased
Down droppd the leg from her slack hand released
The mingled fluids from the base redound
The vase reclining floats the floor around
Smiles dewd with tears the pleasing strife expressd
Of grief and joy alternate in her breast
Her fluttering words in melting murmurs died
At length abruptMy sonmy kingshe cried
His neck with fond embrace infolding fast
Full on the queen her raptured eye she cast
Ardent to speak the monarch safe restored
But studious to conceal her royal lord
Minerva fixd her mind on views remote
And from the present bliss abstracts her thought
His hand to Eurycleas mouth applied
Art thou foredoomd my pest the hero cried
Thy milky founts my infant lips have draind
And have the Fates thy babbling age ordaind
To violate the life thy youth sustaind
An exile have I told with weeping eyes
Full twenty annual suns in distant skies
At length returnd some god inspires thy breast
To know thy king and here I stand confessd
This heavendiscoverd truth to thee consignd
Reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind
Else if the gods my vengeful arm sustain
And prostrate to my sword the suitortrain
With their lewd mates thy undistinguishd age
Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage

Then thus rejoind the dame devoid of fear
What words my son have passed thy lips severe
Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured
With ribs of steel and marble heart immured
When Heaven auspicious to thy right avowd
Shall prostrate to thy sword the suitorcrowd
The deeds Ill blazon of the menial fair
The lewd to death devote the virtuous spare

Thy aid avails me not the chief replied
My own experience shall their doom decide
A witnessjudge precludes a long appeal
Suffice it then thy monarch to conceal

He said obsequious with redoubled pace
She to the fount conveys the exhausted vase
The bath renewd she ends the pleasing toil
With plenteous unction of ambrosial oil
Adjusting to his limbs the tatterd vest
His former seat received the stranger guest
Whom thus with pensive air the queen addressed

Though night dissolving grief in grateful ease
Your drooping eyes with soft impression seize
Awhile reluctant to her pleasing force
Suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse
The day neer brightend with a beam of joy
My menials and domestic cares employ
And unattended by sincere repose
The night assists my everwakeful woes
When natures hushd beneath her brooding shade
My echoing griefs the starry vault invade
As when the months are clad in flowery green
Sad Philomel in bowery shades unseen
To vernal airs attunes her varied strains
And Itylus sounds warbling oer the plains
Young Itylus his parents darling joy
Whom chance misled the mother to destroy
Now doomd a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy
So in nocturnal solitude forlorn
A sad variety of woes I mourn
My mind reflective in a thorny maze
Devious from care to care incessant strays
Now wavering doubt succeeds to long despair
Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere
And joining to my sons my menial train
Partake his counsels and assist his reign
Or since mature in manhood he deplores
His dome dishonourd and exhausted stores
Shall I reluctant to his will accord
And from the peers select the noblest lord
So by my choice avowd at length decide
These wasteful lovedebates a mourning bride
A visionary thought Ill now relate
Illustrate if you know the shadowd fate

A team of twenty geese a snowwhite train
Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain
Amuse my pensive hours The bird of Jove
Fierce from his mountaineyrie downward drove
Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway
And back triumphant wingd his airy way
My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream
To view their death thus imaged in a dream
With tender sympathy to soothe my soul
A troop of matrons fancyformd condole
But whilst with grief and rage my bosom burnd
Sudden the tyrant of the skies returned
Perchd on the battlements he thus began
In form an eagle but in voice a man
O queen no vulgar vision of the sky
I come prophetic of approaching joy
View in this plumy form thy victorlord
The geese a glutton race by thee deplored
Portend the suitors fated to my sword
This said the pleasing featherd omen ceased
When from the downy bands of sleep released
Fast by the limpid lake my swanlike train
I found insatiate of the golden grain

The vision selfexplaind the chief replies
Sincere reveals the sanction of the skies
Ulysses speaks his own return decreed
And by his sword the suitors sure to bleed

Hard is the task and rare the queen rejoind
Impending destinies in dreams to find
Immured within the silent bower of sleep
Two portals firm the various phantoms keep
Of ivory one whence flit to mock the brain
Of winged lies a light fantastic train
The gate opposed pellucid valves adorn
And columns fair incased with polishd horn
Where images of truth for passage wait
With visions manifest of future fate
Not to this troop I fear that phantom soard
Which spoke Ulysses to this realm restored
Delusive semblancebut my remnant life
Heaven shall determine in a gameful strife
With that famed bow Ulysses taught to bend
For me the rival archers shall contend
As on the listed field he used to place
Six beams opposed to six in equal space
Elanced afar by his unerring art
Sure through six circlets flew the whizzing dart
So when the sun restores the purple day
Their strength and skill the suitors shall assay
To him the spousal honour is decreed
Who through the rings directs the featherd reed
Torn from these walls where long the kinder powers
With joy and pomp have wingd my youthful hours
On this poor breast no dawn of bliss shall beam
The pleasure past supplies a copious theme
For many a dreary thought and many a doleful dream

Propose the sportive lot the chief replies
Nor dread to name yourself the bowyers prize
Ulysses will surprise the unfinishd game
Avowd and falsify the suitors claim

To whom with grace serene the queen rejoind
In all thy speech what pleasing force I find
Oer my suspended woe thy words prevail
I part reluctant from the pleasing tale
But Heaven that knows what all terrestrials need
Repose to night and toil to day decreed
Grateful vicissitudes yet me withdrawn
Wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn
Establishd use enjoins to rest and joy
Estranged since dear Ulysses saild to Troy
Meantime instructed is the menial tribe
Your couch to fashion as yourself prescribe

Thus affable her bower the queen ascends
The sovereign step a beauteous train attends
There imaged to her soul Ulysses rose
Down her pale cheek newstreaming sorrow flows
Till soft oblivious shade Minerva spread
And oer her eyes ambrosial slumber shed



BOOK XX

ARGUMENT

While Ulysses lies in the vestibule of the palace he is witness
to the disorders of the women Minerva comforts him and casts him
asleep At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter
which is granted The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people
and the suitors banquet in the palace Telemachus exerts his
authority amongst them notwithstanding which Ulysses is insulted
by Caesippus and the rest continue in their excesses Strange
prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus the augur who explains them
to the destruction of the wooers



An ample hide devine Ulysses spread
And formd of fleecy skins his humble bed
The remnants of the spoil the suitorcrowd
In festival devourd and victims vowd
Then oer the chief Eurynome the chaste
With duteous care a downy carpet cast
With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows
And ruminating wrath he scorns repose

As thus paviliond in the porch he lay
Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey
Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair
With wanton glee the prostituted fair
His heart with rage this new dishonour stung
Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung
Or instant should he quench the guilty flame
With their own blood and intercept the shame
Or to their lust indulge a last embrace
And let the peers consummate the disgrace
Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls
As oer her young the mothermastiff growls
And bays the stranger groom so wrath compressd
Recoiling mutterd thunder in his breast
Poor suffering heart he cried support the pain
Of wounded honour and thy rage restrain
Not fiercer woes thy fortitude could foil
When the brave partners of thy ten years toil
Dire Polypheme devourd I then was freed
By patient prudence from the death decreed

Thus anchord safe on reasons peaceful coast
Tempests of wrath his soul no longer tossd
Restless his body rolls to rage resignd
As one who long with paleeyed famine pined
The savoury cates on glowing embers cast
Incessant turns impatient for repast
Ulysses so from side to sidedevolved
In selfdebate the suitors doom resolved
When in the form of mortal nymph arrayd
From heaven descends the Joveborn martial maid
Andhovering oer his head in view confessd
The goddess thus her favourite care addressd

O thou of mortals most inured to woes
Why roll those eyes unfriended of repose
Beneath thy palaceroof forget thy care
Blessd in thy queen blessd in thy blooming heir
Whom to the gods when suppliant fathers bow
They name the standard of their dearest vow

Just is thy kind reproach the chief rejoind
Deeds full of fate distract my various mind
In contemplation wrappd This hostile crew
What single arm hath prowess to subdue
Or if by Joves and thy auxiliar aid
Theyre doomd to bleed O say celestial maid
Where shall Ulysses shun or how sustain
Nations embattled to revenge the slain

Oh impotence of faith Minerva cries
If man on frail unknowing man relies
Doubt you the gods Lo Pallas self descends
Inspires thy counsels and thy toils attends
In me affianced fortify thy breast
Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest
My sure divinity shall bear the shield
And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field
Now pay the debt to craving nature due
Her faded powers with balmy rest renew
She ceased ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes
Her care dissolves in visionary joys
The goddess pleased regains her natal skies

Not so the queen the downy bands of sleep
By grief relaxd she waked again to weep
A gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair
Then thus her fate invoked with fervent prayer

Diana speed thy deathful ebon dart
And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart
Snatch me ye whirlwinds far from human race
Tossd through the void illimitable space
Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud
Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud
So Pandarus thy hopes three orphan fair
Were doomd to wander through the devious air
Thyself untimely and thy consort died
But four celestials both your cares supplied
Venus in tender delicacy rears
With honey milk and wine their infant years
Imperial Juno to their youth assigned
A form majestic and sagacious mind
With shapely growth Diana graced their bloom
And Pallas taught the texture of the loom
But whilst to learn their lots in nuptial love
Bright Cytherea sought the bower of Jove
The God supreme to whose eternal eye
The registers of fate expanded lie
Wingd Harpies snatch the unguarded charge away
And to the Furies bore a grateful prey
Be such my lot Or thou Diana speed
Thy shaft and send me joyful to the dead
To seek my lord among the warrior train
Ere second vows my bridal faith profane
When woes the waking sense alone assail
Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil
Of other wretches care the torture ends
No truce the warfare of my heart suspends
The night renews the day distracting theme
And airy terrors sable every dream
The last alone a kind illusion wrought
And to my bed my loved Ulysses brought
In manly bloom and each majestic grace
As when for Troy he left my fond embrace
Such raptures in my beating bosom rise
I deem it sure a vision of the skies

Thus whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne
In audible laments she breathes her moan
The sounds assault Ulysses wakeful ear
Misjudging of the cause a sudden fear
Of his arrival known the chief alarms
He thinks the queen is rushing to his arms
Upspringing from his couch with active haste
The fleece and carpet in the dome he placed
The hide without imbibed the morning air
And thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer

Jove and eternal thrones with heaven to friend
If the long series of my woes shall end
Of human race now rising from repose
Let one a blissful omen here disclose
And to confirm my faith propitious Jove
Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above

Whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows
The pitying god his guardian aid avows
Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds
With springing hope the heros heart rebounds
Soon with consummate joy to crown his prayer
An omend voice invades his ravishd ear
Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoind
Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind
Taskd for the royal board to bolt the bran
From the pure flour the growth and strength of man
Discharging to the day the labour due
Now early to repose the rest withdrew
One maid unequal to the task assignd
Still turnd the toilsome mill with anxious mind
And thus in bitterness of soul divined

Father of gods and men whose thunders roll
Oer the cerulean vault and shake the pole
Whoeer from Heaven has gaind this rare ostent
Of granted vows a certain signal sent
In this blest moment of accepted prayer
Piteous regard a wretch consumed with care
Instant O Jove confound the suitortrain
For whom oertoild I grind the golden grain
Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast
And be this festival decreed their last

Big with their doom denounced in earth and sky
Ulysses heart dilates with secret joy
Meantime the menial train with unctious wood
Heapd high the genial hearth Vulcanian food
When early dressd advanced the royal heir
With manly grasp he waved a martial spear
A radiant sabre graced his purple zone
And on his foot the golden sandal shone
His steps impetuous to the portal pressd
And Euryclea thus he there addressd

Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes
Was care for due refection and repose
Bestowd the strangerguest Or waits he grieved
His age not honourd nor his wants relieved
Promiscuous grace on all the queen confers
In woes bewilderd oft the wisest errs
The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires
And modest worth with noble scorn retires

She thus O cease that everhonourd name
To blemish now it ill deserves your blame
A bowl of generous wine sufficed the guest
In vain the queen the night refection pressd
Nor would he court repose in downy state
Unblessd abandond to the rage of Fate
A hide beneath the portico was spread
And fleecy skins composed an humble bed
A downy carpet cast with duteous care
Secured him from the keen nocturnal air

His cornel javelin poised with regal port
To the sage Greeks convened in Themis court
Forthissuing from the dome the prince repaird
Two dogs of chase a lionhearted guard
Behind him sourly stalked Without delay
The dame divides the labour of the day
Thus urging to the toil the menial train

What marks of luxury the marble stain
Its wonted lustre let the floor regain
The seats with purple clothe in order due
And let the abstersive sponge the board renew
Let some refresh the vases sullied mould
Some bid the goblets boast their native gold
Some to the spring with each a jar repair
And copious waters pure for bathing bear
Dispatch for soon the suitors will essay
The lunar feastrites to the god of day

She said with duteous haste a bevy fair
Of twenty virgins to the spring repair
With varied toils the rest adorn the dome
Magnificent and blithe the suitors come
Some wield the sounding axe the dodderd oaks
Divide obedient to the forceful strokes
Soon from the fount with each a brimming urn
Eumaeus in their train the maids return
Three porkers for the feast all brawnychined
He brought the choicest of the tuskykind
In lodgments first secure his care he viewed
Then to the king this friendly speech renewd
Now say sincere my guest the suitortrain
Still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain
Or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane

Some pitying god Ulysses sad replied
With vollied vengeance blast their towering pride
No conscious blush no sense of right restrains
The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins
From vice to vice their appetites are tossd
All cheaply sated at anothers cost

While thus the chief his woes indignant told
Melanthius master of the bearded fold
The goodliest goats of all the royal herd
Spontaneous to the suitors feast preferrd
Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound
With quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound
And to the chief austere aloud began
The wretch unfriendly to the race of man

Here vagrant still offensive to my lords
Blows have more energy than airy words
These arguments Ill use nor conscious shame
Nor threats thy bold intrusion will reclaim
On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast
A plenteous board Hence seek another host

Rejoinder to the churl the king disdaind
But shook his head and rising wrath restraind

From Cephanelia cross the surgy main
Philaetius late arrived a faithful swain
A steer ungrateful to the bulls embrace
And goats he brought the pride of all their race
Imported in a shallop not his own
The dome reechoed to the mingld moan
Straight to the guardian of the bristly kind
He thus began benevolent of mind

What guest is he of such majestic air
His lineage and paternal clime declare
Dim through the eclipse of fate the rays divine
Of sovereign state with faded splendour shine
If monarchs by the gods are plunged in woe
To what abyss are we foredoomd to go
Then affable he thus the chief addressd
Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he pressd

Stranger may fate a milder aspect show
And spin thy future with a whiter clue
O Jove for ever death to human cries
The tyrant not the father of the skies
Unpiteous of the race thy will began
The fool of fate thy manufacture man
With penury contempt repulse and care
The galling load of life is doomd to bear
Ulysses from his state a wanderer still
Upbraids thy power thy wisdom or thy will
O monarch ever dearO man of woe
Fresh flow my tears and shall for ever flow
Like thee poor stranger guest denied his home
Like thee in rags obscene decreed to roam
Or haply perishd on some distant coast
In stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost
Oh grateful for the good his bounty gave
Ill grieve till sorrow sink me to the grave
His kind protecting hand my youth preferrd
The regent of his Cephalenian herd
With vast increase beneath my care it spreads
A stately breed and blackens far the meads
Constraind the choicest beeves I thence import
To cram these cormorants that crowd his court
Who in partition seek his realm to share
Nor human right nor wrath divine revere
Since here resolved oppressive these reside
Contending doubts my anxious heart divide
Now to some foreign clime inclined to fly
And with the royal herd protection buy
Then happier thoughts return the nodding scale
Light mounts despair alternate hopes prevail
In opening prospects of ideal joy
My king returns the proud usurpers die

To whom the chief In thy capacious mind
Since daring zeal with cool debate is joind
Attend a deed already ripe in fate
Attest O Jove the truth I now relate
This sacred truth attest each genial power
Who bless the board and guard this friendly bower
Before thou quit the dome nor long delay
Thy wish produced in act with pleased survey
Thy wondering eyes shall view his rightful reign
By arms avowd Ulysses shall regain
And to the shades devote the suitortrain

O Jove supreme the raptured swain replies
With deeds consummate soon the promised joys
These aged nerves with newborn vigour strung
In that blest cause should emulate the young
Assents Eumaeus to the prayer addressd
And equal ardours fire his loyal breast

Meantime the suitors urge the princes fate
And deathful arts employ the dire debate
When in his airy tour the bird of Jove
Trussd with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove
Sinister to their hope This omen eyed
Amphinomus who thus presaging cried

The gods from force and fraud the prince defend
O peers the sanguinary scheme suspend
Your future thought let sable fate employ
And give the present hour to genial joy

From council straight the assenting peerage ceased
And in the dome prepared the genial feast
Disrobed their vests apart in order lay
Then all with speed succinct the victims slay
With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled
And the proud steer was on the marble spread
With fire prepared they deal the morsels round
Wine rosybright the brimming goblets crownd
By sage Eumaeus borne the purple tide
Melanthius from an ample jar supplied
High canisters of bread Philaetius placed
And eager all devour the rich repast
Disposed apart Ulysses shares the treat
A trivet table and ignobler seat
The prince appoints but to his sire assigns
The tasteful inwards and nectareous wines
Partake my guest he cried without control
The social feast and drain the cheering bowl
Dread not the railers laugh nor ruffians rage
No vulgar roof protects thy honourd age
This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be
From my great sire too soon devolved to me
Your violence and scorn ye suitors cease
Lest arms avenge the violated peace

Awed by the prince so haughty brave and young
Rage gnawd the lip amazement chaind the tongue
Be patient peers at length Antinous cries
The threats of vain imperious youth despise
Would Jove permit the meditated blow
That stream of eloquence should cease to flow

Without reply vouchsafed Antinous ceased
Meanwhile the pomp of festival increased
By heralds rankd in marshalld order move
The city tribes to pleased Apollos grove
Beneath the verdure of which awful shade
The lunar hecatomb they grateful laid
Partook the sacred feast and ritual honours paid
But the rich banquet in the dome prepared
An humble sideboard set Ulysses shared
Observant of the princes high behest
His menial train attend the strangerguest
Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired
By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired
A Samian peer more studious than the rest
Of vice who teemd with many a deadborn jest
And urged for title to a consort queen
Unnumberd acres arable and green
Otesippus named this lord Ulysses eyed
And thus burst out the imposthumate with pride

The sentence I propose ye peers attend
Since due regard must wait the princes friend
Let each a token of esteem bestow
This gift acquits the dear respect I owe
With which he nobly may discharge his seat
And pay the menials for a masters treat

He said and of the steer before him placed
That sinewy fragment at Ulysses cast
Where to the pasternbone by nerves combined
The wellhornd foot indissolubly joind
Which whizzing high the wall unseemly signd
The chief indignant grins a ghastly smile
Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil
When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed
Had not the inglorious wound thy malice aimd
Falln guiltless of the mark my certain spear
Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear
Nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast
The suitor now had vanishd in a ghost
No more ye lewd compeers with lawless power
Invade my dome my herds and flocks devour
For genuine worth of age mature to know
My grape shall redden and my harvest grow
Or if each others wrongs ye still support
With rapes and riot to profane my court
What single arm with numbers can contend
On me let all your lifted swords descend
And with my life such vile dishonours end

A long cessation of discourse ensued
By gentler Agelaus thus renewd

A just reproof ye peers your rage restrain
From the protected guest and menial train
And prince to stop the source of future ill
Assent yourself and gain the royal will
Whilst hope prevaild to see your sire restored
Of right the queen refused a second lord
But who so vain of faith so blind to fate
To think he still survives to claim the state
Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire
To wed as wealth or worth her choice inspire
The lord selected to the nuptial joys
Far hence will lead the longcontested prize
Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty blessd
You reign of this imperial dome possessd

Sage and serene Telemachus replies
By him at whose behest the thunder flies
And by the name on earth I most revere
By great Ulysses and his woes I swear
Who never must review his dear domain
Enrolld perhaps in Plutos dreary train
Wheneer her choice the royal dame avows
My bridal gifts shall load the future spouse
But from this dome my parent queen to chase
From me ye gods avert such dire disgrace

But Pallas clouds with intellectual gloom
The suitors souls insensate of their doom
A mirthful frenzy seized the fated crowd
The roofs resound with causeless laughter loud
Floating in gore portentous to survey
In each discolourd vase the viands lay
Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow
And sudden sighs precede approaching woe
In vision wrappd the Hyperesian seer
Uprose and thus divined the vengeance near

O race to death devote with Stygian shade
Each destind peer impending fates invade
With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drownd
With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round
Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts
To people Orcus and the burning coasts
Nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll
But universal night usurps the pole

Yet warnd in vain with laughter loud elate
The peers reproach the sure divine of Fate
And thus Eurymachus The dotards mind
To every sense is lost to reason blind
Swift from the dome conduct the slave away
Let him in open air behold the day

Tax not the heavenillumined seer rejoind
Of rage or folly my prophetic mind
No clouds of error dim the ethereal rays
Her equal power each faithful sense obeys
Unguided hence my trembling steps I bend
Far hence before yon hovering deaths descend
Lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun
I share the doom ye suitors cannot shun

This said to sage Piraeus sped the seer
His honourd host a welcome inmate there
Oer the protracted feast the suitors sit
And aim to wound the prince with pointless wit
Cries one with scornful leer and mimic voice
Thy charity we praise but not thy choice
Why such profusion of indulgence shown
To this poor timorous toildetesting drone
That others feeds on planetary schemes
And pays his host with hideous noonday dreams
But prince for once at least believe a friend
To some Sicilian mart these courtiers send
Where if they yield their freight across the main
Dear sell the slaves demand no greater gain

Thus jovial they but nought the prince replies
Full on his sire he rolld his ardent eyes
Impatient straight to flesh his virginsword
From the wise chief he waits the deathful word
Nigh in her bright alcove the pensive queen
To see the circle sate of all unseen
Sated at length they rise and bid prepare
An everepast with equal cost and care
But vengeful Pallas with preventing speed
A feast proportiond to their crimes decreed
A feast of death the feasters doomd to bleed



BOOK XXI

ARGUMENT

THE BENDING OF ULYSSES BOW

Penelope to put an end to the solicitation of the suitors
proposes to marry the person who shall first bend the bow of
Ulysses and shoot through the ringlets After their attempts have
proved ineffectual Ulysses taking Eumaeus and Philaetius apart
discovers himself to them then returning desires leave to try
his strength at the bow which though refused with indignation by
the suitors Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be delivered to
his hands He bends it immediately and shoots through all the
rings Jupiter at the same instant thunders from heaven Ulysses
accepts the omen and gives a sign to Telemachus who stands ready
armed at his side



And Pallas now to raise the rivals fires
With her own art Penelope inspires
Who now can bend Ulysses bow and wing
The wellaimd arrow through the distant ring
Shall end the strife and win the imperial dame
But discord and black death await the game

The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends
At distance due a virgintrain attends
A brazen key she held the handle turnd
With steel and polishd elephant adornd
Swift to the inmost room she bent her way
Where safe reposed the royal treasures lay
There shone high heapd the labourd brass and ore
And there the bow which great Ulysses bore
And there the quiver where now guiltless slept
Those winged deaths that many a matron wept

This gift long since when Spartas shore he trod
On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed
Beneath Orsilochus roof they met
One loss was private one a public debt
Messenas state from Ithaca detains
Three hundred sheep and all the shepherd swains
And to the youthful prince to urge the laws
The king and elders trust their common cause
But Iphitus employed on other cares
Searchd the wide country for his wandering mares
And mules the strongest of the labouring kind
Hapless to search more hapless still to find
For journeying on to Hercules at length
That lawless wretch that man of brutal strength
Deaf to Heavens voice the social rites transgressd
And for the beauteous mares destroyd his guest
He gave the bow and on Ulysses part
Received a pointed sword and missile dart
Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore
Their first last pledges for they met no more
The bow bequeathd by this unhappy hand
Ulysses bore not from his native land
Nor in the front of battle taught to bend
But kept in dear memorial of his friend

Now gently winding up the fair ascent
By many an easy step the matron went
Then oer the pavement glides with grace divine
With polishd oak the level pavements shine
The folding gates a dazzling light displayd
With pomp of various architrave oerlaid
The bolt obedient to the silken string
Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring
The wards respondent to the key turn round
The bars fall back the flying valves resound
Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring
So roard the lock when it released the spring
She moves majestic through the wealthy room
Where treasured garments cast a rich perfume
There from the column where aloft it hung
Reachd in its splendid case the bow unstrung
Across her knees she laid the wellknown bow
And pensive sate and tears began to flow
To full satiety of grief she mourns
Then silent to the joyous hall returns
To the proud suitors bears in pensive state
The unbended bow and arrows winged with fate

Behind her train the polishd coffer brings
Which held the alternate brass and silver rings
Full in the portal the chaste queen appears
And with her veil conceals the coming tears
On either side awaits a virgin fair
While thus the matron with majestic air

Say you when these forbidden walls inclose
For whom my victims bleed my vintage flows
If these neglected faded charms can move
Or is it but a vain pretence you love
If I the prize if me you seek to wife
Hear the conditions and commence the strife
Who first Ulysses wondrous bow shall bend
And through twelve ringlets the fleet arrow send
Him will I follow and forsake my home
For him forsake this loved this wealthy dome
Long long the scene of all my past delight
And still to last the vision of my night

Graceful she said and bade Eumaeus show
The rival peers the ringlets and the bow
From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring
Touchd at the dear memorials of his king
Philaetius too relents but secret shed
The tender drops Antinous saw and said

Hence to your fields ye rustics hence away
Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day
Nor to the royal heart recall in vain
The sad remembrance of a perishd man
Enough her precious tears already flow
Or share the feast with due respect or go
To weep abroad and leave to us the bow
No vulgar task Ill suits this courtly crew
That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew
I well remember for I gazed him oer
While yet a child what majesty he bore
And still all infant as I was retain
The port the strength the grandeur of the man

He said but in his soul fond joys arise
And his proud hopes already win the prize
To speed the flying shaft through every ring
Wretch is not thine the arrows of the king
Shall end those hopes and fate is on the wing

Then thus Telemachus Some god I find
With pleasing frenzy has possessd my mind
When a loved mother threatens to depart
Why with this illtimed gladness leaps my heart
Come then ye suitors and dispute a prize
Richer than all the Achaian state supplies
Than all proud Argos or Mycaena knows
Than all our isles or continents inclose
A woman matchless and almost divine
Fit for the praise of every tongue but mine
No more excuses then no more delay
Haste to the trialLo I lead the way

I too may try and if this arm can wing
The featherd arrow through the destined ring
Then if no happier night the conquest boast
I shall not sorrow for a mother lost
But blessd in her possess those arms alone
Heir of my fathers strength as well as throne

He spoke then rising his broad sword unbound
And cast his purple garment on the ground
A trench he opend in a line he placed
The level axes and the points made fast
His perfect skill the wondering gazers eyed
The game as yet unseen as yet untried
Then with a manly pace he took his stand
And graspd the bow and twangd it in his hand
Three times with beating heart he made essay
Three times unequal to the task gave way
A modest boldness on his cheek appeard
And thrice he hoped and thrice again he feard
The fourth had drawn it The great sire with joy
Beheld but with a sign forbade the boy
His ardour straight the obedient prince suppressd
And artful thus the suitortrain addressd

O lay the cause on youth yet immature
For heaven forbid such weakness should endure
How shall this arm unequal to the bow
Retort an insult or repel a foe
But you whom Heaven with better nerves has blessd
Accept the trial and the prize contest

He cast the bow before him and apart
Against the polishd quiver proppd the dart
Resuming then his seat Eupithes son
The bold Antinous to the rest begun
From where the goblet first begins to flow
From right to left in order take the bow
And prove your several strengths The princes heard
And first Leiodes blameless priestd appeard
The eldest born of Oenops noble race
Who next the goblet held his holy place
He only he of all the suitor throng
Their deeds detested and abjured the wrong
With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains
The stubborn horn resisted all his pains
Already in despair he gives it oer
Take it who will he cries I strive no more
What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow
What souls and spirits shall it send below
Better indeed to die and fairly give
Nature her debt than disappointed live
With each new sun to some new hope a prey
Yet still tomorrow falser than today
How long in vain Penelope we sought
This bow shall ease us of that idle thought
And send us with some humbler wife to live
Whom gold shall gain or destiny shall give

Thus speaking on the floor the bow he placed
With rich inlay the various floor was graced
At distance far the featherd shaft he throws
And to the seat returns from whence he rose

To him Antinous thus with fury said
What words illomend from thy lips have fled
Thy cowardfunction ever is in fear
Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear
Why should this bow be fatal to the brave
Because the priest is born a peaceful slave
Mark then what others can He ended there
And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare
He gives it instant flame then fast beside
Spreads oer an ample board a bullocks hide
With melted lard they soak the weapon oer
Chafe every knot and supple every pore
Vain all their art and all their strength as vain
The bow inflexible resists their pain
The force of great Eurymachus alone
And bold Antinous yet untired unknown
Those only now remaind but those confessd
Of all the train the mightiest and the best

Then from the hall and from the noisy crew
The masters of the herd and flock withdrew
The king observes them he the hall forsakes
And past the limits of the court oertakes
Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke
Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock
Shall I the secret of my breast conceal
Or as my soul now dictates shall I tell
Say should some favouring god restore again
The lost Ulysses to his native reign
How beat your hearts what aid would you afford
To the proud suitors or your ancient lord

Philaetius thus O were thy word not vain
Would mighty Jove restore that man again
These aged sinews with new vigour strung
In his blest cause should emulate the young
With equal vows Eumaeus too implored
Each power above with wishes for his lord

He saw their secret souls and thus began
Those vows the gods accord behold the man
Your own Ulysses twice ten years detaind
By woes and wanderings from this hapless land
At length he comes but comes despised unknown
And finding faithful you and you alone
All else have cast him from their very thought
Een in their wishes and their prayers forgot
Hear then my friends If Jove this arm succeed
And give yon impious revellers to bleed
My care shall be to bless your future lives
With large possessions and with faithful wives
Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend
And each on young Telemachus attend
And each be calld his brother and my friend
To give you firmer faith now trust your eye
Lo the broad scar indented on my thigh
When with Autolycus sons of yore
On Parnass top I chased the tusky boar
His ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed
The sign conspicuous and the scar exposed
Eager they viewd with joy they stood amazed
With tearful eyes oer all their master gazed
Around his neck their longing arms they cast
His head his shoulders and his knees embraced
Tears followed tears no word was in their power
In solemn silence fell the kindly shower
The king too weeps the king too grasps their hands
And moveless as a marble fountain stands

Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun
But first the wise man ceased and thus begun
Enoughon other cares your thought employ
For danger waits on all untimely joy
Full many foes and fierce observe us near
Some may betray and yonder walls may hear
Reenter then not all at once but stay
Some moments you and let me lead the way
To me neglected as I am I know
The haughty suitors will deny the bow
But thou Eumaeus as tis borne away
Thy masters weapon to his hand convey
At every portal let some matron wait
And each lock fast the wellcompacted gate
Close let them keep whateer invades their ear
Though arms or shouts or dying groans they hear
To thy strict charge Philaetius we consign
The courts main gate to guard that pass be thine

This said he first returnd the faithful swains
At distance follow as their king ordains
Before the flame Eurymachus now stands
And turns the bow and chafes it with his hands
Still the tough bow unmoved The lofty man
Sighd from his mighty soul and thus began

I mourn the common cause for oh my friends
On me on all what grief what shame attends
Not the lost nuptials can affect me more
For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore
But baffled thus confessd so far below
Ulysses strength as not to bend his bow
How shall all ages our attempt deride
Our weakness scorn Antinous thus replied

Not so Eurymachus that no man draws
The wondrous bow attend another cause
Sacred to Phoebus is the solemn day
Which thoughtless we in games would waste away
Till the next dawn this illtimed strife forego
And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row
Now bid the sewer approach and let us join
In due libations and in rites divine
So end our night before the day shall spring
The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring
Let then to Phoebus name the fatted thighs
Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies
So shall the patron of these arts bestow
For his the gift the skill to bend the bow

They heard well pleased the ready heralds bring
The cleansing waters from the limpid spring
The goblet high with rosy wine they crownd
In order circling to the peers around
That rite complete uprose the thoughtful man
And thus his meditated scheme began

If what I ask your noble minds approve
Ye peers and rivals in the royal love
Chief if it hurt not great Antinous ear
Whose sage decision I with wonder hear
And if Eurymachus the motion please
Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace
Tomorrow let your arms dispute the prize
And take it he the favourd of the skies
But since till then this trial you delay
Trust it one moment to my hands today
Fain would I prove before your judging eyes
What once I was whom wretched you despise
If yet this arm its ancient force retain
Or if my woes a longcontinued train
And wants and insults make me less than man

Rage flashd in lightning from the suitors eyes
Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise
Antinous then O miserable guest
Is common sense quite banishd from thy breast
Sufficed it not within the palace placed
To sit distinguishd with our presence graced
Admitted here with princes to confer
A man unknown a needy wanderer
To copious wine this insolence we owe
And much thy betters wine can overthrow
The great Eurytian when this frenzy stung
Pirithous roofs with frantic riot rung
Boundless the Centaur raged till one and all
The heroes rose and draggd him from the hall
His nose they shortend and his ears they slit
And sent him soberd home with better wit
Hence with long war the double race was cursed
Fatal to all but to the aggressor first
Such fate I prophesy our guest attends
If here this interdicted bow he bends
Nor shall these walls such insolence contain
The first fair wind transports him oer the main
Where Echetus to death the guilty brings
The worst of mortals een the worst of kings
Better than that if thou approve our cheer
Cease the mad strife and share our bounty here

To this the queen her just dislike expressd

Tis impious prince to harm the strangerguest
Base to insult who bears a suppliants name
And some respect Telemachus may claim
What if the immortals on the man bestow
Sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow
Shall I a queen by rival chiefs adored
Accept a wandering stranger for my lord
A hope so idle never touchd his brain
Then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain
Far be he banishd from this stately scene
Who wrongs his princess with a thought so mean

O fair and wisest of so fair a kind
Respectful thus Eurymachus rejoind
Moved by no weak surmise but sense of shame
We dread the allarraigning voice of Fame
We dread the censure of the meanest slave
The weakest woman all can wrong the brave
Behold what wretches to the bed pretend
Of that brave chief whose bow they could not bend
In came a beggar of the strolling crew
And did what all those princes could not do
Thus will the common voice our deed defame
And thus posterity upbraid our name

To whom the queen If fame engage your views
Forbear those acts which infamy pursues
Wrong and oppression no renown can raise
Know friend that virtue is the path to praise
The stature of our guest his port his face
Speak him descended from no vulgar race
To him the bow as he desires convey
And to his hand if Phoebus give the day
Hence to reward his merit be shall bear
A twoedged falchion and a shining spear
Embroiderd sandals a rich cloak and vest
A safe conveyance to his port of rest

O royal mother everhonourd name
Permit me cries Telemachus to claim
A sons just right No Grecian prince but I
Has power this bow to grant or to deny
Of all that Ithacas rough hills contain
And all wide Elis courserbreeding plain
To me alone my fathers arms descend
And mine alone they are to give or lend
Retire O queen thy household task resume
Tend with thy maids the labours of thy loom
The bow the darts and arms of chivalry
These cares to man belong and most to me

Mature beyond his years the queen admired
His sage reply and with her train retired
There in her chamber as she sate apart
Revolved his words and placed them in her heart
On her Ulysses then she fixd her soul
Down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll
Till gentle Pallas piteous of her cries
In slumber closed her silverstreaming eyes

Now through the press the bow Eumaeus bore
And all was riot noise and wild uproar
Hold lawless rustic whither wilt thou go
To whom insensate dost thou bear the bow
Exiled for this to some sequesterd den
Far from the sweet society of men
To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made
If Heaven and Phoebus lend the suitors aid
Thus they Aghast he laid the weapon down
But bold Telemachus thus urged him on
Proceed false slave and slight their empty words
What hopes the fool to please so many lords
Young as I am thy princes vengeful hand
Stretchd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land
Oh could the vigour of this arm as well
The oppressive suitors from my walls expel
Then what a shoal of lawless men should go
To fill with tumult the dark courts below

The suitors with a scornful smile survey
The youth indulging in the genial day
Eumaeus thus encouraged hastes to bring
The strifeful bow and gives it to the king
Old Euryclea calling them aside
Hear what Telemachus enjoins he cried
At every portal let some matron wait
And each lock fast the wellcompacted gate
And if unusual sounds invade their ear
If arms or shouts or dying groans they hear
Let none to call or issue forth presume
But close attend the labours of the loom

Her prompt obedience on his order waits
Closed in an instant were the palace gates
In the same moment forth Philaetius flies
Secures the court and with a cable ties
The utmost gate the cable strongly wrought
Of Byblos reed a ship from Egypt brought
Then unperceived and silent at the board
His seat he takes his eyes upon his lord

And now his wellknown bow the master bore
Turnd on all sides and viewd it oer and oer
Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong
Its owner absent and untried so long
While some deridingHow he turns the bow
Some other like it sure the man must know
Or else would copy or in bows he deals
Perhaps he makes them or perhaps he steals
Heaven to this wretch another cried be kind
And bless in all to which he stands inclined
With such good fortune as he now shall find

Heedless he heard them but disdaind reply
The bow perusing with exactest eye
Then as some heavenly minstrel taught to sing
High notes responsive to the trembling string
To some new strain when he adapts the lyre
Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire
Relaxes strains and draws them to and fro
So the great master drew the mighty bow
And drew with ease One hand aloft displayd
The bending horns and one the string essayd
From his essaying hand the string let fly
Twangd short and sharp like the shrill swallows cry
A general horror ran through all the race
Sunk was each heart and pale was every face
Signs from above ensued the unfolding sky
In lightning burst Jove thunderd from on high
Fired at the call of heavens almighty Lord
He snatchd the shaft that glitterd on the board
Fast by the rest lay sleeping in the sheath
But soon to fly the messengers of death

Now sitting as he was the cord he drew
Through every ringlet levelling his view
Then notchd the shaft released and gave it wing
The whizzing arrow vanished from the string
Sung on direct and threaded every ring
The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds
Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds
Then to the prince Nor have I wrought thee shame
Nor errd this hand unfaithful to its aim
Nor provd the toil too hard nor have I lost
That ancient vigour once my pride and boast
Ill I deserved these haughty peers disdain
Now let them comfort their dejected train
In sweet repast their present hour employ
Nor wait till evening for the genial joy
Then to the lutes soft voice prolong the night
Music the banquets most refined delight

He said then gave a nod and at the word
Telemachus girds on his shining sword
Fast by his fathers side he takes his stand
The beamy javelin lightens in his hand



BOOK XXII

ARGUMENT

THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS

Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of
Antinous He declares himself and lets fly his arrows at the
rest Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father himself
Eumaeus and Philaetius Melanthius does the same for the wooers
Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor The suitors are
all slain only Medon and Phemius are spared Melanthius and the
unfaithful servants are executed The rest acknowledge their
master with all demonstrations of joy



Then fierce the hero oer the threshold strode
Strippd of his rags he blazed out like a god
Full in their face the lifted bow he bore
And quiverd deaths a formidable store
Before his feet the rattling shower he threw
And thus terrific to the suitorcrew

One venturous game this hand hath won today
Another princes yet remains to play
Another mark our arrow must attain
Phoebus assist nor be the labour vain
Swift as the word the parting arrow sings
And bears thy fate Antinous on its wings
Wretch that he was of unprophetic soul
High in his hands he reard the golden bowl
Een then to drain it lengthend out his breath
Changed to the deep the bitter draught of death
For fate who feard amidst a feastful band
And fate to numbers by a single hand
Full through his throat Ulysses weapon passd
And pierced his neck He falls and breathes his last
The tumbling goblet the wide floor oerflows
A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose
Grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls
Before him spurnd the loaded table falls
And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood
Of floating meats and wine and human blood
Amazed confounded as they saw him fall
Up rose he throngs tumultuous round the hall
Oer all the dome they cast a haggard eye
Each lookd for armsin vain no arms were nigh
Aimst thou at princes all amazed they said
Thy last of games unhappy hast thou playd
Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed
And death unlucky guest attends thy deed
Vultures shall tear thee Thus incensed they spoke
While each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke
Blind as they were for death een now invades
His destined prey and wraps them all in shades
Then grimly frowning with a dreadful look
That witherd all their hearts Ulysses spoke

Dogs ye have had your day ye feard no more
Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore
While to your lust and spoil a guardless prey
Our house our wealth our helpless handmaids lay
Not so content with bolder frenzy fired
Een to our bed presumptuous you aspired
Laws or divine or human faild to move
Or shame of men or dread of gods above
Heedless alike of infamy or praise
Or Fames eternal voice in future days
The hour of vengeance wretches now is come
Impending fate is yours and instant doom

Thus dreadful he Confused the suitors stood
From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood
Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide
Alone the bold Eurymachus replied

If as thy words import he thus began
Ulysses lives and thou the mighty man
Great are thy wrongs and much hast thou sustaind
In thy spoild palace and exhausted land
The cause and author of those guilty deeds
Lo at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds
Not love but wild ambition was his guide
To slay thy son thy kingdom to divide
These were his aims but juster Jove denied
Since cold in death the offender lies oh spare
Thy suppliant people and receive their prayer
Brass gold and treasures shall the spoil defray
Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay
The waste of years refunded in a day
Till then thy wrath is just Ulysses burnd
With high disdain and sternly thus returnd

All all the treasure that enrichd our throne
Before your rapines joind with all your own
If offerd vainly should for mercy call
Tis you that offer and I scorn them all
Your blood is my demand your lives the prize
Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies
Hence with those coward terms or fight or fly
This choice is left you to resist or die
And die I trust ye shall He sternly spoke
With guilty fears the pale assembly shook
Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train
Yon archer comrades will not shoot in vain
But from the threshold shall his darts be sped
Whoeer he be till every prince lie dead
Be mindful of yourselves draw forth your swords
And to his shafts obtend these ample boards
So need compels Then all united strive
The bold invader from his post to drive
The city roused shall to our rescue haste
And this mad archer soon have shot his last
Swift as he spoke he drew his traitor sword
And like a lion rushd against his lord
The wary chief the rushing foe repressd
Who met the point and forced it in his breast
His falling hand deserts the lifted sword
And prone he falls extended oer the board
Before him wide in mixd effusion roll
The untasted viands and the jovial bowl
Full through his liver passd the mortal wound
With dying rage his forehead beats the ground
He spurnd the seat with fury as he fell
And the fierce soul to darkness dived and hell
Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends
To force the pass the godlike man defends
Thy spear Telemachus prevents the attack
The brazen weapon driving through his back
Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore
Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor
And his crushd forehead marks the stone with gore
He left his javelin in the dead for fear
The long encumbrance of the weighty spear
To the fierce foe advantage might afford
To rash between and use the shortend sword
With speedy ardour to his sire he flies
And Arm great father arm in haste he cries
Lo hence I run for other arms to wield
For missive javelins and for helm and shield
Fast by our side let either faithful swain
In arms attend us and their part sustain

Haste and return Ulysses made reply
While yet the auxiliar shafts this hand supply
Lest thus alone encounterd by an host
Driven from the gate the important past be lost

With speed Telemachus obeys and flies
Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies
Four brazen helmets eight refulgent spears
And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears
At once in brazen panoply they shone
At once each servant braced his armour on
Around their king a faithful guard they stand
While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand
Chief after chief expired at every wound
And swelld the bleeding mountain on the ground
Soon as his store of flying fates was spent
Against the wall he set the bow unbent
And now his shoulders bear the massy shield
And now his hands two beamy javelins wield
He frowns beneath his nodding plume that playd
Oer the high crest and cast a dreadful shade

There stood a window near whence looking down
From oer the porch appeard the subject town
A double strength of valves secured the place
A high and narrow but the only pass
The cautious king with allpreventing care
To guard that outlet placed Eumaeus there
When Agelaus thus Has none the sense
To mount yon window and alarm from thence
The neighbourtown the town shall force the door
And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more
Melanthius then That outlet to the gate
So near adjoins that one may guard the strait
But other methods of defence remain
Myself with arms can furnish all the train
Stores from the royal magazine I bring
And their own darts shall pierce the prince and king

He said and mounting up the lofty stairs
Twelve shields twelve lances and twelve helmets bears
All arm and sudden round the hall appears
A blaze of bucklers and a wood of spears

The hero stands oppressd with mighty woe
On every side he sees the labour grow
Oh cursed event and oh unlookd for aid
Melanthius or the women have betrayd
Oh my dear sonThe father with a sigh
Then ceased the filial virtue made reply

Falsehood is folly and tis just to own
The fault committed this was mine alone
My haste neglected yonder door to bar
And hence the villain has supplied their war
Run good Eumaeus then and what before
I thoughtless errd in well secure that door
Learn if by female fraud this deed were done
Or as my thought misgives by Dolius son

While yet they spoke in quest of arms again
To the high chamber stole the faithless swain
Not unobserved Eumaeus watchful eyed
And thus addressd Ulysses near his side

The miscreant we suspected takes that way
Him if this arm be powerful shall I slay
Or drive him hither to receive the meed
From thy own hand of this detested deed

Not so replied Ulysses leave him there
For us sufficient is another care
Within the structure of this palace wall
To keep enclosed his masters till they fall
Go you and seize the felon backward bind
His arms and legs and fix a plank behind
On this his body by strong cords extend
And on a column near the roof suspend
So studied tortures his vile days shall end

The ready swains obeyd with joyful haste
Behind the felon unperceived they passd
As round the room in quest of arms he goes
The halfshut door conceald his lurking foes
One hand sustaind a helm and one the shield
Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield
Coverd with dust with dryness chappd and worn
The brass corroded and the leather torn
Thus laden oer the threshold as he steppd
Fierce on the villain from each side they leapd
Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew
And down reluctant on the pavement threw
Active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil
At every point their masters rigid will
First fast behind his hands and feet they bound
Then straightend cords involved his body round
So drawn aloft athwart the column tied
The howling felon swung from side to side

Eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain
There pass thy pleasing night O gentle swain
On that soft pillow from that envied height
First mayst thou see the springing dawn of light
So timely rise when morning streaks the east
To drive thy victims to the suitors feast

This said they left him tortured as he lay
Secured the door and hasty strode away
Each breathing death resumed his dangerous post
Near great Ulysses four against an host
When lo descending to her heros aid
Joves daughter Pallas Wars triumphant maid
In Mentors friendly form she joind his side
Ulysses saw and thus with transport cried

Come ever welcome and thy succour lend
O every sacred name in one my friend
Early we loved and long our loves have grown
Whateer through lifes whole series I have done
Or good or grateful now to mind recall
And aiding this one hour repay it all

Thus he but pleasing hopes his bosom warm
Of Pallas latent in the friendly form
The adverse host the phantomwarrior eyed
And first loudthreatening Agelaus cried

Mentor beware nor let that tongue persuade
Thy frantic arm to lend Ulysses aid
Our force successful shall our threat make good
And with the sire and son commix thy blood
What hopest thou here Thee first the sword shall slay
Then lop thy whole posterity away
Far hence thy banishd consort shall we send
With his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend
Thus and thus only shalt thou join thy friend

His barbarous insult even the goddess fires
Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires

Art thou Ulysses where then shall we find
The patient body and the constant mind
That courage once the Trojans daily dread
Known nine long years and felt by heroes dead
And where that conduct which revenged the lust
Of Priams race and laid proud Troy in dust
If this when Helen was the cause were done
What for thy country now thy queen thy son
Rise then in combat at my side attend
Observe what vigour gratitude can lend
And foes how weak opposed against a friend

She spoke but willing longer to survey
The sire and sons great acts withheld the day
By farther toils decreed the brave to try
And level poised the wings of victory
Then with a change of form eludes their sight
Perchd like a swallow on a rafters height
And unperceived enjoys the rising fight

Damastors son bold Agelaus leads
The guilty war Eurynomus succeeds
With these Pisander great Polyctors son
Sage Polybus and stern Amphimedon
With Demoptolemus these six survive
The best of all the shafts had left alive
Amidst the carnage desperate as they stand
Thus Agelaus roused the lagging band

The hour has come when yon fierce man no more
With bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor
Lo Mentor leaves him with an empty boast
The four remain but four against an host
Let each at once discharge the deadly dart
One sure of six shall reach Ulysses heart
The rest must perish their great leader slain
Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain

Then all at once their mingled lances threw
And thirsty all of one mans blood they flew
In vain Minerva turned them with her breath
And scattered short or wide the points of death
With deadend sound one on the threshold falls
One strikes the gate one rings against the walls
The storm passed innocent The godlike man
Now loftier trod and dreadful thus began
Tis now brave friends our turn at once to throw
So speed them Heaven our javelins at the foe
That impious race to all their past misdeeds
Would add our blood injustice still proceeds

He spoke at once their fiery lances flew
Great Demoptolemus Ulysses slew
Euryades received the princes dart
The goatherds quiverd in Pisanders heart
Fierce Elatus by thine Eumaeus falls
Their fall in thunder echoes round the walls
The rest retreat the victors now advance
Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance
Again the foe discharge the steely shower
Again made frustrate by the virginpower
Some turnd by Pallas on the threshold fall
Some wound the gate some ring against the wall
Some weak or ponderous with the brazen head
Drop harmless on the pavement sounding dead

Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast
Thy hand Telemachus it lightly razed
And from Ctesippus arm the spear elanced
On good Eumaeus shield and shoulder glanced
Not lessened of their force so light the wound
Each sung along and dropped upon the ground
Fate doomd thee next Eurydamus to bear
Thy death ennobled by Ulysses spear
By the bold son Amphimedon was slain
And Polybus renownd the faithful swain
Pierced through the breast the rude Ctesippus bled
And thus Philaetius gloried oer the dead

There end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain
O sharp in scandal voluble and vain
How weak is mortal pride To Heaven alone
The event of actions and our fates are known
Scoffer behold what gratitude we bear
The victims heel is answered with this spear

Ulysses brandishd high his vengeful steel
And Damastorides that instant fell
Fast by Leocritus expiring lay
The princes javelin tore its bloody way
Through all his bowels down he tumbled prone
His batterd front and brains besmear the stone

Now Pallas shines confessd aloft she spreads
The arm of vengeance oer their guilty heads
The dreadful aegis blazes in their eye
Amazed they see they tremble and they fly
Confused distracted through he rooms they fling
Like oxen maddend by the breezes sting
When sultry days and long succeed the gentle spring
Not half so keen fierce vultures of the chase
Stoop from the mountains on the featherd race
When the wide field extended snares beset
With conscious dread they shun the quivering net
No help no flight but wounded every way
Headlong they drop the fowlers seize their prey
On all sides thus they double wound on wound
In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground
Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan
And a red deluge floats the reaking stone

Leiodes first before the victor falls
The wretched augur thus for mercy calls
Oh gracious hear nor let thy suppliant bleed
Still undishonoured or by word or deed
Thy house for me remains by me repressd
Full oft was checkd the injustice of the rest
Averse they heard me when I counselled well
Their hearts were hardend and they justly fell
O spare an augurs consecrated head
Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead

Priest as thou art for that detested band
Thy lying prophecies deceived the land
Against Ulysses have thy vows been made
For them thy daily orisons were paid
Yet more een to our bed thy pride aspires
One common crime one common fate requires

Thus speaking from the ground the sword he took
Which Agelaus dying hand forsook
Full through his neck the weighty falchion sped
Along the pavement rolld the muttering head

Phemius alone the hand of vengeance spared
Phemius the sweet the heaveninstructed bard
Beside the gate the reverend minstrel stands
The lyre now silent trembling in his hands
Dubious to supplicate the chief or fly
To Joves inviolable altar nigh
Where oft Laertes holy vows had paid
And oft Ulysses smoking victims laid
His honourd harp with care he first set down
Between the laver and the silver throne
Then prostrate stretchd before the dreadful man
Persuasive thus with accent soft began

O king to mercy be thy soul inclined
And spare the poets evergentle kind
A deed like this thy future fame would wrong
For dear to gods and men is sacred song
Selftaught I sing by Heaven and Heaven alone
The genuine seeds of poesy are sown
And what the gods bestow the lofty lay
To gods alone and godlike worth we pay
Save then the poet and thyself reward
Tis thine to merit mine is to record
That here I sung was force and not desire
This hand reluctant touchd the warbling wire
And let thy son attest nor sordid pay
Nor servile flattery staind the moral lay

The moving words Telemachus attends
His sire approaches and the bard defends
O mix not father with those impious dead
The man divine forbear that sacred head
Medon the herald too our arms may spare
Medon who made my infancy his care
If yet he breathes permit thy son to give
Thus much to gratitude and bid him live

Beneath a table trembling with dismay
Couchd close to earth unhappy Medon lay
Wrappd in a newslain oxs ample hide
Swift at the word he cast his screen aside
Sprung to the prince embraced his knee with tears
And thus with grateful voice addressd his ears

O prince O friend lo here thy Medon stands
Ah stop the heros unresisted hands
Incensed too justly by that impious brood
Whose guilty glories now are set in blood
To whom Ulysses with a pleasing eye

Be bold on friendship and my son rely
Live an example for the world to read
How much more safe the good than evil deed
Thou with the heaventaught bard in peace resort
From blood and carnage to yon open court
Me other work requires With timorous awe
From the dire scene the exempted two withdraw
Scarce sure of life look round and trembling move
To the bright altars of Protector Jove

Meanwhile Ulysses searchd the dome to find
If yet there live of all the offending kind
Not one complete the bloody tale he found
All steepd in blood all gasping on the ground
So when by hollow shores the fishertrain
Sweep with their arching nets the roaring main
And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain
All naked of their element and bare
The fishes pant and gasp in thinner air
Wide oer the sands are spread the stiffening prey
Till the warm sun exhales their soul away

And now the king commands his son to call
Old Euryclea to the deathful hall
The son observant not a moment stays
The aged governess with speed obeys
The sounding portals instant they display
The matron moves the prince directs the way
On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood
All black with dust and coverd thick with blood
So the grim lion from the slaughter comes
Dreadful lie glares and terribly he foams
His breast with marks of carnage painted oer
His jaws all dropping with the bulls black gore

Soon as her eyes the welcome object met
The guilty falln the mighty deed complete
A scream of joy her feeble voice essayd
The hero checkd her and composedly said

Woman experienced as thou art control
Indecent joy and feast thy secret soul
To insult the dead is cruel and unjust
Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust
Nor heeded these the censure of mankind
The good and bad were equal in their mind
Justly the price of worthlessness they paid
And each now wails an unlamented shade
But thou sincere O Euryclea say
What maids dishonour us and what obey

Then she In these thy kingly walls remain
My son full fifty of the handmaid train
Taught by my care to cull the fleece or weave
And servitude with pleasing tasks deceive
Of these twice six pursue their wicked way
Nor me nor chaste Penelope obey
Nor fits it that Telemachus command
Young as he is his mothers female band
Hence to the upper chambers let me fly
Where slumbers soft now close the royal eye
There wake her with the newsthe matron cried
Not so Ulysses more sedate replied
Bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds
In haste the matron parts the king proceeds
Now to dispose the dead the care remains
To you my son and you my faithfull swains
The offending females to that task we doom
To wash to scent and purify the room
These every table cleansed and every throne
And all the melancholy labour done
Drive to yon court without the palace wall
There the revenging sword shall smite them all
So with the suitors let them mix in dust
Stretchd in a long oblivion of their lust
He said the lamentable train appear
Each vents a groan and drops a tender tear
Each heaved her mournful burden and beneath
The porch deposed the ghastly heap of death
The chief severe compelling each to move
Urged the dire task imperious from above
With thirsty sponge they rub the tables oer
The swains unite their toil the walls the floor
Washd with the effusive wave are purged of gore
Once more the palace set in fair array
To the base court the females take their way
There compassd close between the dome and wall
Their lifes last scene they trembling wait their fall

Then thus the prince To these shall we afford
A fate so pure as by the martial sword
To these the nightly prostitutes to shame
And base revilers of our house and name

Thus speaking on the circling wall he strung
A ships tough cable from a column hung
Near the high top he straind it strongly round
Whence no contending foot could reach the ground
Their heads above connected in a row
They beat the air with quivering feet below
Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare
The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air
Soon fled the soul impure and left behind
The empty corse to waver with the wind

Then forth they led Melanthius and began
Their bloody work they loppd away the man
Morsel for dogs then trimmd with brazen shears
The wretch and shortend of his nose and ears
His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel
He roard and torments gave his soul to hell
They wash and to Ulysses take their way
So ends the bloody business of the day

To Euryclea then addressd the king
Bring hither fire and hither sulphur bring
To purge the palace then the queen attend
And let her with her matrontrain descend
The matrontrain with all the virginband
Assemble here to learn their lords command

Then Euryclea Joyful I obey
But cast those mean dishonest rags away
Permit me first the royal robes to bring
Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king
Bring sulphur straight and fire the monarch cries
She hears and at the word obedient flies
With fire and sulphur cure of noxious fumes
He purged the walls and bloodpolluted rooms
Again the matron springs with eager pace
And spreads her lords return from place to place
They hear rush forth and instant round him stand
A gazing throng a torch in every hand
They saw they knew him and with fond embrace
Each humbly kissd his knee or hand or face
He knows them all in all such truth appears
Een he indulges the sweet joy of tears



BOOK XXIII

ARGUMENT

Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses return and
the death of the suitors Penelope scarcely credits her but
supposes some god has punished them and descends from her
department in doubt At the first interview of Ulysses and
Penelope she is quite unsatisfied Minerva restores him to the
beauty of his youth but the queen continues incredulous till by
some circumstances she is convinced and falls into all the
transports of passion and tenderness They recount to each other
all that has passed during their long separation The next morning
Ulysses arming himself and his friends goes from the city to
visit his father



Then to the queen as in repose she lay
The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way
The transports of her faithful heart supply
A sudden youth and give her wings to fly

And sleeps my child the reverend matron cries
Ulysses lives arise my child arise
At length appears the longexpected hour
Ulysses comes the suitors are no more
No more they view the golden light of day
Arise and bless thee with the glad survey

Touchd at her words the mournful queen rejoind
Ah whither wanders thy distemperd mind
The righteous powers who tread the starry skies
The weak enlighten and confound the wise
And human thought with unresisted sway
Depress or raise enlarge or take away
Truth by their high decree thy voice forsakes
And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks
Unkind the fond illusion to impose
Was it to flatter or deride my woes
Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy
Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy
Why must I wake to grieve and curse thy shore
O Troymay never tongue pronounce thee more
Begone another might have felt our rage
But age is sacred and we spare thy age

To whom with warmth My soul a lie disdains
Ulysses lives thy own Ulysses reigns
That stranger patient of the suitors wrongs
And the rude license of ungovernd tongues
He he is thine Thy son his latent guest
Long knew but lockd the secret in his breast
With well concerted art to end his woes
And burst at once in vengeance on the foes

While yet she spoke the queen in transport sprung
Swift from the couch and round the matron hung
Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear
Say once more say is my Ulysses here
How could that numerous and outrageous band
By one be slain though by a heros hand

I saw it not she cries but heard alone
When death was busy a loud dying groan
The damseltrain turnd pale at every wound
Immured we sate and catchd each passing sound
When death had seized her prey thy son attends
And at his nod the damseltrain descends
There terrible in arms Ulysses stood
And the dead suitors almost swam in blood
Thy heart had leapd the hero to survey
Stern as the surly lion oer his prey
Glorious in gore now with sulphereous fire
The dome he purges now the flame aspires
Heapd lie the dead without the palace walls
Haste daughter haste thy own Ulysses calls
Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow
Enjoy the present good and former woe
Ulysses lives his vanquishd foes to see
He lives to thy Telemachus and thee

Ah no with sighs Penelope rejoind
Excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind
How blest this happy hour should he appear
Dear to us all to me supremely dear
Ah no some god the suitors death decreed
Some god descends and by his hand they bleed
Blind to contemn the strangers righteous cause
And violate all hospitable laws
The good they hated and the powers defied
But heaven is just and by a god they died
For never must Ulysses view this shore
Never the loved Ulysses is no more

What words the matron cries have reachd my ears
Doubt we his presence when he now appears
Then hear conviction Ere the fatal day
That forced Ulysses oer the watery way
A boar fierce rushing in the sylvan war
Ploughd half his thigh I saw I saw the scar
And wild with transport had reveald the wound
But ere I spoke he rose and checkd the sound
Then daughter haste away and if a lie
Flow from this tongue then let thy servant die
To whom with dubious joy the queen replies
Wise is thy soul but errors seize the wise
The works of gods what mortal can survey
Who knows their motives who shall trace their way
But learn we instant how the suitors trod
The paths of death by man or by a god
Thus speaks the queen and no reply attends
But with alternate joy and fear descends
At every step debates her lord to prove
Or rushing to his arms confess her love
Then gliding through the marble valves in state
Opposed before the shining sire she sate
The monarch by a column high enthroned
His eye withdrew and fixd it on the ground
Curious to hear his queen the silence break
Amazed she sate and impotent to speak
Oer all the man her eyes she rolls in vain
Now hopes now fears now knows then doubts again
At length Telemachus Oh who can find
A woman like Penelope unkind
Why thus in silence why with winning charms
Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms
Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows
When twice ten years are passd of mighty woes
To softness lost to spousal love unknown
The gods have formed that rigid heart of stone
O my Telemachus the queen rejoind
Distracting fears confound my labouring mind
Powerless to speak I scarce uplift my eyes
Nor dare to question doubts on doubts arise
Oh deign he if Ulysses to remove
These boding thoughts and what he is to prove
Pleased with her virtuous fears the king replies
Indulge my son the cautions of the wise
Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring
This garb of poverty belies the king
No more This day our deepest care requires
Cautious to act what thought mature inspires
If one mans blood though mean distain our hands
The homicide retreats to foreign lands
By us in heaps the illustrious peerage falls
The important deed our whole attention calls

Be that thy care Telemachus replies
The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise
For wisdom all is thine lo I obey
And dauntless follow where you led the way
Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find
Thy coward son degenerate lag behind

Then instant to the bath the monarch cries
Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise
Thence all descend in pomp and proud array
And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay
While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings
And forms the dance responsive to the strings
That hence the eluded passengers may say
Lo the queen weds we hear the spousal lay
The suitors death unknown till we remove
Far from the court and act inspired by Jove

Thus spoke the king the observant train obey
At once they bathe and dress in proud array
The lyrist strikes the string gay youths advance
And fairzoned damsels form the sprightly dance
The voice attuned to instrumental sounds
Ascends the roof the vaulted roof rebounds
Not unobserved the Greeks eluded say
Lo the queen weds we hear the spousal lay
Inconstant to admit the bridal hour
Thus theybut nobly chaste she weds no more

Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends
With faithful cares Eurynome attends
Oer every limb a shower of fragrance sheds
Then dressd in pomp magnificent he treads
The warriorgoddess gives his frame to shine
With majesty enlarged and grace divine
Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly
His thick large locks of hyacinthine dye
As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives
His heavenly skill a breathing image lives
By Pallas taught he frames the wondrous mould
And the pale silver glows with fusile gold
So Pallas his heroic form improves
With bloom divine and like a god he moves
More high he treads and issuing forth in state
Radiant before his gazing consort sate
And O my queen he cries what power above
Has steeld that heart averse to spousal love
Canst thou Penelope when heaven restores
Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores
Canst thou O cruel unconcernd survey
Thy lost Ulysses on this signal day
Haste Euryclea and despatchful spread
For me and me alone the imperial bed
My weary nature craves the balm of rest
But Heaven with adamant has armd her breast

Ah no she cries a tender heart I bear
A foe to pride no adamant is there
And now een now it melts for sure I see
Once more Ulysses my beloved in thee
Fixd in my soul as when he sailed to Troy
His image dwells then haste the bed of joy
Haste from the bridal bower the bed translate
Framd by his hand and be it dressd in state

Thus speaks the queen still dubious with disguise
Touchd at her words the king with warmth replies
Alas for this what mortal strength can move
The enormous burden who but Heaven above
It mocks the weak attempts of human hands
But the whole earth must move if Heaven commands
Then hear sure evidence while we display
Words seald with sacred truth and truth obey
This hand the wonder framed an olive spread
Full in the court its ever verdant head
Vast as some mighty columns bulk on high
The huge trunk rose and heaved into the sky
Around the tree I raised a nuptial bower
And roofd defensive of the storm and shower
The spacious valve with art inwrought conjoins
And the fair dome with polished marble shines
I loppd the branchy head aloft in twain
Severd the bole and smoothed the shining grain
Then posts capacious of the frame I raise
And bore it regular from space to space
Athwart the frame at equal distance lie
Thongs of tough hides that boast a purple dye
Then polishing the whole the finished mould
With silver shone with elephant and gold
But if oerturnd by rude ungovernd hands
Or still inviolate the olive stands
Tis thine O queen to say and now impart
If fears remain or doubts distract thy heart

While yet he speaks her powers of life decay
She sickens trembles falls and faints away
At length recovering to his arms she flew
And straind him close as to his breast she grew
The tears pourd down amain and O she cries
Let not against thy spouse thine anger rise
O versed in every turn of human art
Forgive the weakness of a womans heart
The righteous powers that mortal lot dispose
Decree us to sustain a length of woes
And from the flower of life the bliss deny
To bloom together fade away and die
O let me let me not thine anger move
That I forbore thus thus to speak my love
Thus in fond kisses while the transport warms
Pour out my soul and die within thine arms
I dreaded fraud Men faithless men betray
Our easy faith and make our sex their prey
Against the fondness of my heart I strove
Twas caution O my lord not want of love
Like me had Helen feard with wanton charms
Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms
Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day
Thus had she feard she had not gone astray
But Heaven averse to Greece in wrath decreed
That she should wander and that Greece should bleed
Blind to the ills that from injustice flow
She colourd all our wretched lives with woe
But why these sorrows when my lord arrives
I yield I yield my own Ulysses lives
The secrets of the bridal bed are known
To thee to me to Actoris alone
My fathers present in the spousal hour
The sole attendant on our genial bower
Since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveald
Hard and distrustful as I am I yield

Touchd to the soul the king with rapture hears
Hangs round her neck and speaks his joy in tears
As to the shipwreckd mariner the shores
Delightful rise when angry Neptune roars
Then when the surge in thunder mounts the sky
And gulfd in crowds at once the sailors die
If one more happy while the tempest raves
Outlives the tumult of conflicting waves
All pale with ooze deformd he views the strand
And plunging forth with transport grasps the land
The ravishd queen with equal rapture glows
Clasps her loved lord and to his bosom grows
Nor had they ended till the morning ray
But Pallas backward held the rising day
The wheels of night retarding to detain
The gay Aurora in the wavy main
Whose flaming steeds emerging through the night
Beam oer the eastern hills with streaming light

At length Ulysses with a sigh replies
Yet Fate yet cruel Fate repose denies
A labour long and hard remains behind
By heaven above by hell beneath enjoind
For to Tiresias through the eternal gates
Of hell I trode to learn my future fates
But end we herethe night demands repose
Be deckd the couch and peace awhile my woes

To whom the queen Thy word we shall obey
And deck the couch far hence be woes away
Since the just gods who tread the starry plains
Restore thee safe since my Ulysses reigns
But what those perils heaven decrees impart
Knowledge may grieve but fear distracts the heart

To this the king Ah why must I disclose
A dreadful story of approaching woes
Why in this hour of transport wound thy ears
When thou must learn what I must speak with tears
Heaven by the Theban ghost thy spouse decrees
Torn from thy arms to sail a length of seas
From realm to realm a nation to explore
Who neer knew salt or heard the billows roar
Nor saw gay vessel storm the surgy plain
A painted wonder flying on the main
An oar my hand must bear a shepherd eyes
The unknown instrument with strange surprise
And calls a cornvan this upon the plain
I fix and hail the monarch of the main
Then bathe his altars with the mingled gore
Of victims vowd a ram a bull a boar
Thence swift resailing to my native shores
Due victims slay to all the ethereal powers
Then Heaven decrees in peace to end my days
And steal myself from life by slow decays
Unknown to pain in age resign my breath
When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death
To the dark grave retiring as to rest
My people blessing by my people blessd
Such future scenes the allrighteous powers display
By their dread seer and such my future day

To whom thus firm of soul If ripe for death
And full of days thou gently yield thy breath
While Heaven a kind release from ills foreshows
Triumph thou happy victor of thy woes

But Euryclea with dispatchful care
And sage Eurynome the couch prepare
Instant they bid the blazing torch display
Around the dome and artificial day
Then to repose her steps the matron bends
And to the queen Eurynome descends
A torch she bears to light with guiding fires
The royal pair she guides them and retires
The instant his fair spouse Ulysses led
To the chaste loverites of the nuptial bed

And now the blooming youths and sprightly fair
Cease the gay dance and to their rest repair
But in discourse the king and consort lay
While the soft hours stole unperceived away
Intent he hears Penelope disclose
A mournful story of domestic woes
His servants insults his invaded bed
How his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled
His generous wines dishonourd shed in vain
And the wild riots of the suitortrain
The king alternate a dire tale relates
Of wars of triumphs and disastrous fates
All he unfolds his listening spouse turns pale
With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale
Sleepless devours each word and hears how slain
Cicons on Cicons swell the ensanguined plain
How to the land of Lote unblessd he sails
And images the rills and flowery vales
How dashd like dogs his friends the Cyclops tore
Not unrevenged and quaffd the spouting gore
How the loud storms in prison bound he sails
From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales
Yet fate withstands a sudden tempest roars
And whirls him groaning from his native shores
How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast
By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost
How scarce himself survived he paints the bower
The spells of Circe and her magic power
His dreadful journey to the realms beneath
To seek Tiresias in the vales of death
How in the doleful mansions lie surveyd
His royal mother pale Anticleas shade
And friends in battle slain heroic ghosts
Then how unharmd he passd the Syrencoasts
The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves
And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves
The cave of death How his companions slay
The oxen sacred to the god of day
Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides
And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides
How struggling through the surge lie reachd the shores
Of fair Ogygia and Calypsos bowers
Where the bay blooming nymph constraind his stay
With sweet reluctant amorous delay
And promised vainly promised to bestow
Immortal life exempt from age and woe
How saved from storms Phaeacias coast he trod
By great Alcinous honourd as a god
Who gave him last his country to behold
With change of raiment brass and heaps of gold

He ended sinking into sleep and shares
A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares

Soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day
Minerva rushes through the aerial way
And bids Aurora with her golden wheels
Flame from the ocean oer the eastern hills
Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed
And thus with thought mature the monarch said

My queen my consort through a length of years
We drank the cup of sorrow mixd with tears
Thou for thy lord while me the immortal powers
Detaind reluctant from my native shores
Now blessd again by Heaven the queen display
And rule our palace with an equal sway
Be it my care by loans or martial toils
To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils
But now I haste to bless Laertes eyes
With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies
The good old man to wasting woes a prey
Weeps a sad life in solitude away
But hear though wise This morning shall unfold
The deathful scene on heroes heroes rolld
Thou with thy maids within the palace stay
From all the scene of tumult far away

He spoke and sheathed in arms incessant flies
To wake his son and bid his friends arise
To arms aloud he cries his friends obey
With glittering arms their manly limbs array
And pass the city gate Ulysses leads the way
Now flames the rosy dawn but Pallas shrouds
The latent warriors in a veil of clouds



BOOK XXIV

ARGUMENT

The souls of the suitors are conducted by Mercury to the infernal
shades Ulysses in the country goes to the retirement of his
father Laertes he finds him busied in his garden all alone the
manner of his discovery to him is beautifully described They
return together to his lodge and the king is acknowledged by
Dolius and the servants The Ithacensians led by Eupithes the
father of Antinous rise against Ulysses who gives them battle in
which Eupithes is killed by Laertes and the goddess Pallas makes
a lasting peace between Ulysses and his subjects which concludes
the Odyssey



Cylenius now to Plutos dreary reign
Conveys the dead a lamentable train
The golden wand that causes sleep to fly
Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye
That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day
Points out the long uncomfortable way
Trembling the spectres glide and plaintive vent
Thin hollow screams along the deep descent
As in the cavern of some rifted den
Where flock nocturnal bats and birds obscene
Clusterd they hang till at some sudden shock
They move and murmurs run through all the rock
So cowering fled the sable heaps of ghosts
And such a scream filld all the dismal coasts
And now they reachd the earths remotest ends
And now the gates where evening Sol descends
And Leucas rock and Oceans utmost streams
And now pervade the dusky land of dreams
And rest at last where souls unbodied dwell
In everflowing meads of asphodel
The empty forms of men inhabit there
Impassive semblance images of air
Naught else are all that shined on earth before
Ajax and great Achilles are no more
Yet still a master ghost the rest he awed
The rest adored him towering as he trod
Still at his side is Nestors son surveyd
And loved Patroclus still attends his shade

New as they were to that infernal shore
The suitors stoppd and gazed the hero oer
When moving slow the regal form they viewd
Of great Atrides him in pomp pursued
And solemn sadness through the gloom of hell
The train of those who by AEgysthus fell

O mighty chief Pelides thus began
Honourd by Jove above the lot of man
King of a hundred kings to whom resignd
The strongest bravest greatest of mankind
Comest thou the first to view this dreary state
And was the noblest the first mark of Fate
Condemnd to pay the great arrear so soon
The lot which all lament and none can shun
Oh better hadst thou sunk in Trojan ground
With all thy fullblown honours coverd round
Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise
Historic marbles to record thy praise
Thy praise eternal on the faithful stone
Had with transmissive glories graced thy son
But heavier fates were destined to attend
What man is happy till he knows his end

O son of Peleus greater than mankind
Thus Agamemnons kingly shade rejoind
Thrice happy thou to press the martial plain
Midst heaps of heroes in thy quarrel slain
In clouds of smoke raised by the noble fray
Great and terrific een in death you lay
And deluges of blood flowd round you every way
Nor ceased the strife till Jove himself opposed
And all in Tempests the dire evening closed
Then to the fleet we bore thy honourd load
And decent on the funeral bed bestowd
Then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed
Tears flowd from every eye and oer the dead
Each clippd the curling honours of his head
Struck at the news thy azure mother came
The seagreen sisters waited on the dame
A voice of loud lament through all the main
Was heard and terror seized the Grecian train
Back to their ships the frighted host had fled
But Nestor spoke they listend and obeyd
From old experience Nestors counsel springs
And long vicissitudes of human things
Forbear your flight fair Thetis from the main
To mourn Achilles leads her azure train
Around thee stand the daughters of the deep
Robe thee in heavenly vests and round thee weep
Round thee the Muses with alternate strain
In everconsecrating verse complain
Each warlike Greek the moving music hears
And ironhearted heroes melt in tears
Till seventeen nights and seventeen days returnd
All that was mortal or immortal mournd
To flames we gave thee the succeeding day
And fatted sheep and sable oxen slay
With oils and honey blazed the augmented fires
And like a god adornd thy earthly part expires
Unnumberd warriors round the burning pile
Urge the fleet coursers or the racers toil
Thick clouds of dust oer all the circle rise
And the mixd clamour thunders in the skies
Soon as absorbd in allembracing flame
Sunk what was mortal of thy mighty name
We then collect thy snowy bones and place
With wines and unguents in a golden vase
The vase to Thetis Bacchus gave of old
And Vulcans art enrichd the sculptured gold
There we thy relics great Achilles blend
With dear Patroclus thy departed friend
In the same urn a separate space contains
Thy next beloved Antilochus remains
Now all the sons of warlike Greece surround
Thy destined tomb and cast a mighty mound
High on the shore the growing hill we raise
That wide the extended Hellespont surveys
Where all from age to age who pass the coast
May point Achilles tomb and hail the mighty ghost
Thetis herself to all our peers proclaims
Heroic prizes and exequial games
The gods assented and around thee lay
Rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day
Oft have I seen with solemn funeral games
Heroes and kings committed to the flames
But strength of youth or valour of the brave
With nobler contest neer renownd a grave
Such were the games by azure Thetis given
And such thy honours O beloved of Heaven
Dear to mankind thy fame survives nor fades
Its bloom eternal in the Stygian shades
But what to me avail my honours gone
Successful toils and battles bravely won
Doomd by stern Jove at home to end my life
By cursed Aegysthus and a faithless wife
Thus they while Hermes oer the dreary plain
Led the sad numbers by Ulysses slain
On each majestic form they cast a view
And timorous passd and awfully withdrew
But Agamemnon through the gloomy shade
His ancient host Amphimedon surveyd
Son of Melanthius he began O say
What cause compelld so many and so gay
To tread the downward melancholy way
Say could one city yield a troop so fair
Were all these partners of one native air
Or did the rage of stormy Neptune sweep
Your lives at once and whelm beneath the deep
Did nightly thieves or pirates cruel bands
Drench with your blood your pillaged countrys sands
Or welldefending some beleaguerd wall
Sayfor the public did ye greatly fall
Inform thy guest for such I was of yore
When our triumphant navies touchd your shore
Forced a long month the wintry seas to bear
To move the great Ulysses to the war

O king of men I faithful shall relate
Replied Amphimedon our hapless fate
Ulysses absent our ambitious aim
With rival loves pursued his royal dame
Her coy reserve and prudence mixd with pride
Our common suit nor granted nor denied
But close with inward hate our deaths designd
Versed in all arts of wily womankind
Her hand laborious in delusion spread
A spacious loom and mixd the various thread
Ye peers she cried who press to gain my heart
Where dead Ulysses claims no more a part
Yet a short space your rival suit suspend
Till this funereal web my labours end
Cease till to good Laertes I bequeath
A task of grief his ornaments of death
Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim
The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame
Should he long honourd with supreme command
Want the last duties of a daughters hand

The fiction pleased our generous train complies
Nor fraud mistrusts in virtues fair disguise
The work she plied but studious of delay
Each following night reversed the toils of day
Unheard unseen three years her arts prevail
The fourth her maid reveald the amazing tale
And showd as unperceived we took our stand
The backward labours of her faithless hand
Forced she completes it and before us lay
The mingled web whose gold and silver ray
Displayd the radiance of the night and day

Just as she finished her illustrious toil
Ill fortune led Ulysses to our isle
Far in a lonely nook beside the sea
At an old swineherds rural lodge he lay
Thither his son from sandy Pyle repairs
And speedy lands and secretly confers
They plan our future ruin and resort
Confederate to the city and the court
First came the son the father nest succeeds
Clad like a beggar whom Eumaeus leads
Proppd on a staff deformd with age and care
And hung with rags that flutterd in the air
Who could Ulysses in that form behold
Scornd by the young forgotten by the old
Illused by all to every wrong resigned
Patient he suffered with a constant mind
But when arising in his wrath to obey
The will of Jove he gave the vengeance way
The scattered arms that hung around the dome
Careful he treasured in a private room
Then to her suitors bade his queen propose
The archers strife the source of future woes
And omen of our death In vain we drew
The twanging string and tried the stubborn yew
To none it yields but great Ulysses hands
In vain we threat Telemachus commands
The bow he snatchd and in an instant bent
Through every ring the victor arrow went
Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood
Poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood
And frownd before us dreadful as a god
First bleeds Antinous thick the shafts resound
And heaps on heaps the wretches strew the ground
This way and that we turn we fly we fall
Some god assisted and unmannd us all
Ignoble cries precede the dying groans
And battered brains and blood besmear the stones

Thus great Atrides thus Ulysses drove
The shades thou seest from yon fair realms above
Our mangled bodies now deformed with gore
Cold and neglected spread the marble floor
No friend to bathe our wounds or tears to shed
Oer the pale corse the honours of the dead

Oh blessd Ulysses thus the king expressd
His sudden rapture in thy consort blessd
Not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined
Not more thy patience than her constant mind
Icarius daughter glory of the past
And model to the future age shall last
The gods to honour her fair fame shall rise
Their great reward a poet in her praise
Not such O Tyndarus thy daughters deed
By whose dire hand her king and husband bled
Her shall the Muse to infamy prolong
Example dread and theme of tragic song
The general sex shall suffer in her shame
And een the best that bears a womans name

Thus in the regions of eternal shade
Conferrd the mournful phantoms of the dead
While from the town Ulysses and his band
Passd to Laertes cultivated land
The ground himself had purchased with his pain
And labour made the rugged soil a plain
There stood his mansion of the rural sort
With useful buildings round the lowly court
Where the few servants that divide his care
Took their laborious rest and homely fare
And one Sicilian matron old and sage
With constant duty tends his drooping age

Here now arriving to his rustic band
And martial son Ulysses gave command
Enter the house and of the bristly swine
Select the largest to the powers divine
Alone and unattended let me try
If yet I share the old mans memory
If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know
Their light and dearest object long ago
Now changed with time with absence and with woe
Then to his train he gives his spear and shield
The house they enter and he seeks the field
Through rows of shade with various fruitage crownd
And labourd scenes of richest verdure round
Nor aged Dolius nor his sons were there
Nor servants absent on another care
To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn
Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn

But all alone the hoary king he found
His habit course but warmly wrappd around
His head that bowd with many a pensive care
Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair
His buskins old in former service torn
But swell repaird and gloves against the thorn
In this array the kingly gardener stood
And cleard a plant encumberd with its wood

Beneath a neighbouring tree the chief divine
Gazed oer his sire retracing every line
The ruins of himself now worn away
With age yet still majestic in decay
Sudden his eyes released their watery store
The muchenduring man could bear no more
Doubtful he stood if instant to embrace
His aged limbs to kiss his reverend face
With eager transport to disclose the whole
And pour at once the torrent of his soul
Not so his judgment takes the winding way
Of question distant and of soft essay
More gentle methods on weak age employs
And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys
Then to his sire with beating heart he moves
And with a tender pleasantry reproves
Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead
Nor aught remits the work while thus he said

Great is thy skill O father great thy toil
Thy careful hand is stampd on all the soil
Thy squadrond vineyards well thy art declare
The olive green blue fig and pendent pear
And not one empty spot escapes thy care
On every plant and tree thy cares are shown
Nothing neglected but thyself alone
Forgive me father if this fault I blame
Age so advanced may some indulgence claim
Not for thy sloth I deem thy lord unkind
Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind
I read a monarch in that princely air
The same thy aspect if the same thy care
Soft sleep fair garments and the joys of wine
These are the rights of age and should be thine
Who then thy master say and whose the land
So dressd and managed by thy skilful hand
But chief oh tell me what I question most
Is this the farfamed Ithacensian coast
For so reported the first man I viewd
Some surly islander of manners rude
Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay
Heedless he whistled and pursued his way
But thou whom years have taught to understand
Humanely hear and answer my demand
A friend I seek a wise one and a brave
Say lives he yet or moulders in the grave
Time was my fortunes then were at the best
When at my house I lodged this foreign guest
He said from Ithacas fair isle he came
And old Laertes was his fathers name
To him whatever to a guest is owed
I paid and hospitable gifts bestowd
To him seven talents of pure ore I told
Twelve cloaks twelve vests twelve tunics stiff with gold
A bowl that rich with polishd silver flames
And skilld in female works four lovely dames

At this the father with a fathers fears
His venerable eyes bedimmd with tears
This is the land but ah thy gifts are lost
For godless men and rude possess the coast
Sunk is the glory of this oncefamed shore
Thy ancient friend O stranger is no more
Full recompense thy bounty else had borne
For every good man yields a just return
So civil rights demand and who begins
The track of friendship not pursuing sins
But tell me stranger be the truth confessd
What years have circled since thou sawst that guest
That hapless guest alas for ever gone
Wretch that he was and that I am my son
If ever man to misery was born
Twas his to suffer and tis mine to mourn
Far from his friends and from his native reign
He lies a prey to monsters of the main
Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear
Or screaming vultures scatter through the air
Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed
Nor waild his father oer the untimely dead
Nor his sad consort on the mournful bier
Seald his cold eyes or droppd a tender tear

But tell me who thou art and what thy race
Thy town thy parents and thy native place
Or if a merchant in pursuit of gain
What port received thy vessel from the main
Or comest thou single or attend thy train

Then thus the son From Alybas I came
My palace there Eperitus my name
Not vulgar born from Aphidas the king
Of Polyphemons royal line I spring
Some adverse demon from Sicania bore
Our wandering course and drove us on your shore
Far from the town an unfrequented bay
Relieved our wearied vessel from the sea
Five years have circled since these eyes pursued
Ulysses parting through the sable flood
Prosperous he saild with dexter auguries
And all the wingd good omens of the skies
Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore
Whom Heaven alas decreed to meet no more

Quick through the fathers heart these accents ran
Grief seized at once and wrappd up all the man
Deep from his soul lie sighd and sorrowing spread
A cloud of ashes on his hoary head
Trembling with agonies of strong delight
Stood the great son heartwounded with the sight
He ran he seized him with a strict embrace
With thousand kisses wanderd oer his face
I I am he O father rise behold
Thy son with twenty winters now grown old
Thy son so long desired so long detaind
Restored and breathing in his native land
These floods of sorrow O my sire restrain
The vengeance is complete the suitor train
Stretchd in our palace by these hands lie slain

Amazed Laertes Give some certain sign
If such thou art to manifest thee mine

Lo here the wound he cries received of yore
The scar indented by the tusky boar
When by thyself and by Anticlea sent
To old Autolycus realms I went
Yet by another sign thy offspring know
The several trees you gave me long ago
While yet a child these fields I loved to trace
And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace
To every plant in order as we came
Wellpleased you told its nature and its name
Whateer my childish fancy askd bestowd
Twelve peartrees bowing with their pendent load
And ten that red with blushing apples glowd
Full fifty purple figs and many a row
Of various vines that then began to blow
A future vintage when the Hours produce
Their latent buds and Sol exalts the juice

Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain
His heart within him melt his knees sustain
Their feeble weight no more his arms alone
Support him round the loved Ulysses thrown
He faints he sinks with mighty joys oppressd
Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast
Soon as returning life regains its seat
And his breath lengthens and his pulses beat
Yes I believe he cries almighty Jove
Heaven rules us yet and gods there are above
Tis sothe suitors for their wrongs have paid
But what shall guard us if the town invade
If while the news through every city flies
All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise
To this Ulysses As the gods shall please
Be all the rest and set thy soul at ease
Haste to the cottage by this orchards side
And take the banquet which our cares provide
There wait thy faithful band of rural friends
And there the young Telemachus attends

Thus having said they traced the garden oer
And stooping entered at the lowly door
The swains and young Telemachus they found
The victim portiond and the goblet crownd
The hoary king his old Sicilian maid
Perfumd and washd and gorgeously arrayed
Pallas attending gives his frame to shine
With awful port and majesty divine
His gazing son admires the godlike grace
And air celestial dawning oer his face
What god he cried my fathers form improves
How high he treads and how enlarged he moves

Oh would to all the deathless powers on high
Pallas and Jove and him who gilds the sky
Replied the king elated with his praise
My strength were still as once in better days
When the bold Cephalens the leaguer formd
And proud Nericus trembled as I stormd
Such were I now not absent from your deed
When the last sun beheld the suitors bleed
This arm had aided yours this hand bestrown
Our shores with death and pushd the slaughter on
Nor had the sire been separate from the son

They communed thus while homeward bent their way
The swains fatigued with labours of the day
Dolius the first the venerable man
And next his sons a long succeeding train
For due refection to the bower they came
Calld by the careful old Sicilian dame
Who nursed the children and now tends the sire
They see their lord they gaze and they admire
On chairs and beds in order seated round
They share the gladsome board the roofs resound
While thus Ulysses to his ancient friend
Forbear your wonder and the feast attend
The rites have waited long The chief commands
Their love in vain old Dolius spreads his hands
Springs to his master with a warm embrace
And fastens kisses on his hands and face
Then thus broke out O long O daily mournd
Beyond our hopes and to our wish returnd
Conducted sure by Heaven for Heaven alone
Could work this wonder welcome to thy own
And joys and happiness attend thy throne
Who knows thy blessd thy wishd return oh say
To the chaste queen shall we the news convey
Or hears she and with blessings loads the day

Dismiss that care for to the royal bride
Already is it known the king replied
And straight resumed his seat while round him bows
Each faithful youth and breathes out ardent vows
Then all beneath their father take their place
Rankd by their ages and the banquet grace

Now flying Fame the swift report had spread
Through all the city of the suitors dead
In throngs they rise and to the palace crowd
Their sighs were many and the tumult loud
Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain
Inhume the natives in their native plain
The rest in ships are wafted oer the main
Then sad in council all the seniors sate
Frequent and full assembled to debate
Amid the circle first Eupithes rose
Big was his eye with tears his heart with woes
The bold Antinous was his ages pride
The first who by Ulysses arrow died
Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran
As mixing words with sighs he thus began

Great deeds O friends this wondrous man has wrought
And mighty blessings to his country brought
With ships he parted and a numerous train
Those and their ships he buried in the main
Now he returns and first essays his hand
In the best blood of all his native land
Haste then and ere to neighbouring Pyle he flies
Or sacred Elis to procure supplies
Arise or ye for ever fall arise
Shame to this age and all that shall succeed
If unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed
Prove that we live by vengeance on his head
Or sink at once forgotten with the dead
Here ceased he but indignant tears let fall
Spoke when he ceased dumb sorrow touchd them all
When from the palace to the wondering throng
Sage Medon came and Phemius came along
Restless and early sleeps soft bands they broke
And Medon first the assembled chiefs bespoke

Hear me ye peers and elders of the land
Who deem this act the work of mortal hand
As oer the heaps of death Ulysses strode
These eyes these eyes beheld a present god
Who now before him now beside him stood
Fought as he fought and markd his way with blood
In vain old Mentors form the god belied
Twas Heaven that struck and Heaven was on his side

A sudden horror all the assembly shook
When slowly rising Halitherses spoke
Reverend and wise whose comprehensive view
At once the present and the future knew
Me too ye fathers hear from you proceed
The ills ye mourn your own the guilty deed
Ye gave your sons your lawless sons the rein
Oft warnd by Mentor and myself in vain
An absent heros bed they sought to soil
An absent heros wealth they made their spoil
Immoderate riot and intemperate lust
The offence was great the punishment was just
Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale
Nor rush to ruin Justice will prevail

His moderate words some better minds persuade
They part and join him but the number stayd
They storm they shout with hasty frenzy fired
And second all Eupithes rage inspired
They case their limbs in brass to arms they run
The broad effulgence blazes in the sun
Before the city and in ample plain
They meet Eupithes heads the frantic train
Fierce for his son he breathes his threats in air
Fate bears them not and Death attends him there

This passd on earth while in the realms above
Minerva thus to cloudcompelling Jove
May I presume to search thy secret soul
O Power Supreme O Ruler of the whole
Say hast thou doomd to this divided state
Or peaceful amity or stern debate
Declare thy purpose for thy will is fate

Is not thy thought my own the god replies
Who rolls the thunder oer the vaulted skies
Hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed
The chiefs return should make the guilty bleed
Tis done and at thy will the Fates succeed
Yet hear the issue Since Ulysses hand
Has slain the suitors Heaven shall bless the land
None now the kindred of the unjust shall own
Forgot the slaughterd brother and the son
Each future day increase of wealth shall bring
And oer the past Oblivion stretch her wing
Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest
His people blessing by his people blessd
Let all be peaceHe said and gave the nod
That binds the Fates the sanction of the god
And prompt to execute the eternal will
Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill

Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast
The rage of hunger and of thirst repressd
To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent
A son of Dolius on the message went
Stood in the way and at a glance beheld
The foe approach embattled on the field
With backward step he hastens to the bower
And tells the news They arm with all their power
Four friends alone Ulysses cause embrace
And six were all the sons of Dolius race
Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on
And still more old in arms Laertes shone
Trembling with warmth the hoary heroes stand
And brazen panoply invests the band
The opening gates at once their war display
Fierce they rush forth Ulysses leads the way
That moment joins them with celestial aid
In Mentors form the Jovedescended maid
The suffering hero felt his patient breast
Swell with new joy and thus his son addressd

Behold Telemachus nor fear the sight
The brave embattled the grim front of fight
The valiant with the valiant must contend
Shame not the line whence glorious you descend
Wide oer the world their martial fame was spread
Regard thyself the living and the dead

Thy eyes great father on this battle cast
Shall learn from me Penelope was chaste

So spoke Telemachus the gallant boy
Good old Laertes heard with panting joy
And blessd thrice blessd this happy day he cries
The day that shows me ere I close my eyes
A son and grandson of the Arcesian name
Strive for fair virtue and contest for fame

Then thus Minerva in Laertes ear
Son of Arcesius reverend warrior hear
Jove and Joves daughter first implore in prayer
Then whirling high discharge thy lance in air
She said infusing courage with the word
Jove and Joves daughter then the chief implored
And whirling high dismissd the lance in air
Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear
The brasscheekd helmet opens to the wound
He falls earth thunders and his arms resound
Before the father and the conquering son
Heaps rush on heaps they fight they drop they run
Now by the sword and now the javelin fall
The rebel race and death had swallowd all
But from on high the blueeyed virgin cried
Her awful voice detaind the headlong tide
Forbear ye nations your mad hands forbear
From mutual slaughter Peace descends to spare
Fear shook the nations at the voice divine
They drop their javelins and their rage resign
All scatterd round their glittering weapons lie
Some fall to earth and some confusedly fly
With dreadful shouts Ulysses pourd along
Swift as an eagle as an eagle strong
But Joves red arm the burning thunder aims
Before Minerva shot the livid flames
Blazing they fell and at her feet expired
Then stopped the goddess trembled and retired

Descended from the gods Ulysses cease
Offend not Jove obey and give the peace

So Pallas spoke the mandate from above
The king obeyd The virginseed of Jove
In Mentors form confirmd the full accord
And willing nations knew their lawful lord

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

Here is the briefest record of our progress  means estimated
