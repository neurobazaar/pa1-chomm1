THE RAVENSWING



CHAPTER I WHICH IS ENTIRELY INTRODUCTORYCONTAINS AN ACCOUNT OF MISS
CRUMP HER SUITORS AND HER FAMILY CIRCLE

In a certain quiet and sequestered nook of the retired village of
Londonperhaps in the neighbourhood of Berkeley Square or at any
rate somewhere near Burlington Gardensthere was once a house of
entertainment called the Bootjack Hotel Mr Crump the landlord had
in the outset of life performed the duties of Boots in some inn even
more frequented than his own and far from being ashamed of his origin
as many persons are in the days of their prosperity had thus solemnly
recorded it over the hospitable gate of his hotel

Crump married Miss Budge so well known to the admirers of the festive
dance on the other side of the water as Miss Delancy and they had
one daughter named Morgiana after that celebrated part in the Forty
Thieves which Miss Budge performed with unbounded applause both at
the Surrey and The Wells Mrs Crump sat in a little bar profusely
ornamented with pictures of the dancers of all ages from Hillisberg
Rose Parisot who plied the light fantastic toe in 1805 down to the
Sylphides of our day There was in the collection a charming portrait of
herself done by De Wilde she was in the dress of Morgiana and in the
act of pouring to very slow music a quantity of boiling oil into one
of the forty jars In this sanctuary she sat with black eyes black
hair a purple face and a turban and morning noon or night as you
went into the parlour of the hotel there was Mrs Crump taking tea
with a little something in it looking at the fashions or reading
Cumberlands British Theatre The Sunday Times was her paper for she
voted the Dispatch that journal which is taken in by most ladies of her
profession to be vulgar and Radical and loved the theatrical gossip in
which the other mentioned journal abounds

The fact is that the Royal Bootjack though a humble was a very
genteel house and a very little persuasion would induce Mr Crump as
he looked at his own door in the sun to tell you that he had himself
once drawn off with that very bootjack the topboots of His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales and the first gentleman in Europe While
then the houses of entertainment in the neighbourhood were loud in
their pretended Liberal politics the Bootjack stuck to the good old
Conservative line and was only frequented by such persons as were of
that way of thinking There were two parlours much accustomed one for
the gentlemen of the shoulderknot who came from the houses of their
employers hard by another for some gents who used the ouse as Mrs
Crump would say Heaven bless her in her simple Cockniac dialect and
who formed a little club there

I forgot to say that while Mrs C was sipping her eternal tea or
washing up her endless blue china you might often hear Miss Morgiana
employed at the little redsilk cottage piano singing Come where the
haspens quiver or Bonny lad march over hill and furrow or My art
and lute or any other popular piece of the day And the dear girl sang
with very considerable skill too for she had a fine loud voice which
if not always in tune made up for that defect by its great energy and
activity and Morgiana was not content with singing the mere tune but
gave every one of the roulades flourishes and ornaments as she heard
them at the theatres by Mrs Humby Mrs Waylett or Madame Vestris
The girl had a fine black eye like her mamma a grand enthusiasm for
the stage as every actors child will have and if the truth must be
known had appeared many and many a time at the theatre in Catherine
Street in minor parts first and then in Little Pickle in Desdemona
in Rosina and in Miss Footes part where she used to dance I have not
the name to my hand but think it is Davidson Four times in the week
at least her mother and she used to sail off at night to some place of
public amusement for Mrs Crump had a mysterious acquaintance with
all sorts of theatrical personages and the gates of her old haunt The
Wells of the Cobourg by the kind permission of Mrs Davidge nay
of the Lane and the Market themselves flew open before her
Open sesame as the robbers door did to her colleague Ali Baba
Hornbuckle in the operatic piece in which she was so famous

Beer was Mr Crumps beverage diversified by a little gin in the
evenings and little need be said of this gentleman except that he
discharged his duties honourably and filled the presidents chair at
the club as completely as it could possibly be filled for he could not
even sit in it in his greatcoat so accurately was the seat adapted to
him His wife and daughter perhaps thought somewhat slightingly of
him for he had no literary tastes and had never been at a theatre
since he took his bride from one He was valet to Lord Slapper at the
time and certain it is that his lordship set him up in the Bootjack
and that stories HAD been told But what are such to you or me Let
bygones be bygones Mrs Crump was quite as honest as her neighbours
and Miss had five hundred pounds to be paid down on the day of her
wedding

Those who know the habits of the British tradesman are aware that he has
gregarious propensities like any lord in the land that he loves a joke
that he is not averse to a glass that after the days toil he is happy
to consort with men of his degree and that as society is not so far
advanced among us as to allow him to enjoy the comforts of splendid
clubhouses which are open to many persons with not a tenth part of his
pecuniary means he meets his friends in the cosy tavern parlour where
a neat sanded floor a large Windsor chair and a glass of hot something
and water make him as happy as any of the clubmen in their magnificent
saloons

At the Bootjack was as we have said a very genteel and select
society called the Kidney Club from the fact that on Saturday
evenings a little graceful supper of broiled kidneys was usually
discussed by the members of the club Saturday was their grand night
not but that they met on all other nights in the week when inclined for
festivity and indeed some of them could not come on Saturdays in the
summer having elegant villas in the suburbs where they passed the
sixandthirty hours of recreation that are happily to be found at the
end of every week

There was Mr Balls the great grocer of South Audley Street a warm
man who they say had his twenty thousand pounds Jack Snaffle of the
mews hard by a capital fellow for a song Clinker the ironmonger
all married gentlemen and in the best line of business Tressle the
undertaker etc No liveries were admitted into the room as may be
imagined but one or two select butlers and majordomos joined the
circle for the persons composing it knew very well how important it
was to be on good terms with these gentlemen and many a time my lords
account would never have been paid and my ladys large order never have
been given but for the conversation which took place at the Bootjack
and the friendly intercourse subsisting between all the members of the
society

The tiptop men of the society were two bachelors and two as fashionable
tradesmen as any in the town Mr Woolsey from Stultzs of the famous
house of Linsey Woolsey and Co of Conduit Street Tailors and Mr
Eglantine the celebrated perruquier and perfumer of Bond Street whose
soaps razors and patent ventilating scalps are know throughout Europe
Linsey the senior partner of the tailors firm had his handsome mansion
in Regents Park drove his buggy and did little more than lend his
name to the house Woolsey lived in it was the working man of the firm
and it was said that his cut was as magnificent as that of any man in
the profession Woolsey and Eglantine were rivals in many waysrivals
in fashion rivals in wit and above all rivals for the hand of
an amiable young lady whom we have already mentioned the darkeyed
songstress Morgiana Crump They were both desperately in love with her
that was the truth and each in the absence of the other abused his
rival heartily Of the hairdresser Woolsey said that as for Eglantine
being his real name it was all his Mr Woolseys eye that he was in
the hands of the Jews and his stock and grand shop eaten up by usury
And with regard to Woolsey Eglantine remarked that his pretence
of being descended from the Cardinal was all nonsense that he was a
partner certainly in the firm but had only a sixteenth share and
that the firm could never get their moneys in and had an immense number
of bad debts in their books As is usual there was a great deal of
truth and a great deal of malice in these tales however the gentlemen
were take them all in all in a very fashionable way of business and
had their claims to Miss Morgianas hand backed by the parents Mr
Crump was a partisan of the tailor while Mrs C was a strong advocate
for the claims of the enticing perfumer

Now it was a curious fact that these two gentlemen were each in
need of the others servicesWoolsey being afflicted with premature
baldness or some other necessity for a wig still more fatalEglantine
being a very fat man who required much art to make his figure at all
decent He wore a brown frockcoat and frogs and attempted by all sorts
of contrivances to hide his obesity but Woolseys remark that dress
as he would he would always look like a snob and that there was
only one man in England who could make a gentleman of him went to the
perfumers soul and if there was one thing on earth he longed for not
including the hand of Miss Crump it was to have a coat from Linseys
in which costume he was sure that Morgiana would not resist him

If Eglantine was uneasy about the coat on the other hand he attacked
Woolsey atrociously on the score of his wig for though the latter went
to the best makers he never could get a peruke to sit naturally upon
him and the unhappy epithet of Mr Wiggins applied to him on one
occasion by the barber stuck to him ever after in the club and
made him writhe when it was uttered Each man would have quitted the
Kidneys in disgust long since but for the otherfor each had an
attraction in the place and dared not leave the field in possession of
his rival

To do Miss Morgiana justice it must be said that she did not encourage
one more than another but as far as accepting eaudeCologne and
haircombs from the perfumersome opera tickets a treat to Greenwich
and a piece of real Genoa velvet for a bonnet it had originally been
intended for a waistcoat from the admiring tailor she had been
equally kind to each and in return had made each a present of a lock
of her beautiful glossy hair It was all she had to give poor girl
and what could she do but gratify her admirers by this cheap and artless
testimony of her regard A pretty scene and quarrel took place between
the rivals on the day when they discovered that each was in possession
of one of Morgianas ringlets

Such then were the owners and inmates of the little Bootjack
from whom and which as this chapter is exceedingly discursive and
descriptive we must separate the reader for a while and carry himit
is only into Bond Street so no gentleman need be afraidcarry him into
Bond Street where some other personages are awaiting his consideration

Not far from Mr Eglantines shop in Bond Street stand as is very well
known the Windsor Chambers The West Diddlesex Association Western
Branch the British and Foreign Soap Company the celebrated attorneys
Kite and Levison have their respective offices here and as the names
of the other inhabitants of the chambers are not only painted on the
walls but also registered in Mr Boyles Court Guide it is quite
unnecessary that they should be repeated here Among them on the
entresol between the splendid saloons of the Soap Company on the first
floor with their statue of Britannia presenting a packet of the soap to
Europe Asia Africa and America and the West Diddlesex Western Branch
on the basementlives a gentleman by the name of Mr Howard Walker
The brass plate on the door of that gentlemans chambers had the word
Agency inscribed beneath his name and we are therefore at liberty
to imagine that he followed that mysterious occupation In person Mr
Walker was very genteel he had large whiskers dark eyes with a slight
cast in them a cane and a velvet waistcoat He was a member of a
club had an admission to the opera and knew every face behind the
scenes and was in the habit of using a number of French phrases in his
conversation having picked up a smattering of that language during a
residence on the Continent in fact he had found it very convenient
at various times of his life to dwell in the city of Boulogne where
he acquired a knowledge of smoking ecarte and billiards which was
afterwards of great service to him He knew all the best tables in
town and the marker at Hunts could only give him ten He had some
fashionable acquaintances too and you might see him walking arminarm
with such gentlemen as my Lord Vauxhall the Marquess of Billingsgate
or Captain Buff and at the same time nodding to young Moses the
dandy bailiff or Loder the gamblinghouse keeper or Aminadab the
cigarseller in the Quadrant Sometimes he wore a pair of moustaches
and was called Captain Walker grounding his claim to that title upon
the fact of having once held a commission in the service of Her Majesty
the Queen of Portugal It scarcely need be said that he had been through
the Insolvent Court many times But to those who did not know his
history intimately there was some difficulty in identifying him with the
individual who had so taken the benefit of the law inasmuch as in
his schedule his name appeared as Hooker Walker winemerchant
commissionagent musicseller or what not The fact is that though he
preferred to call himself Howard Hooker was his Christian name and it
had been bestowed on him by his worthy old father who was a clergyman
and had intended his son for that profession But as the old gentleman
died in York gaol where he was a prisoner for debt he was never able
to put his pious intentions with regard to his son into execution and
the young fellow as he was wont with many oaths to assert was thrown
on his own resources and became a man of the world at a very early age

What Mr Howard Walkers age was at the time of the commencement of this
history and indeed for an indefinite period before or afterwards it
is impossible to determine If he were eightandtwenty as he asserted
himself Time had dealt hardly with him his hair was thin there were
many crowsfeet about his eyes and other signs in his countenance
of the progress of decay If on the contrary he were forty as Sam
Snaffle declared who himself had misfortunes in early life and vowed
he knew Mr Walker in Whitecross Street Prison in 1820 he was a very
younglooking person considering his age His figure was active and
slim his leg neat and he had not in his whiskers a single white hair

It must however be owned that he used Mr Eglantines Regenerative
Unction which will make your whiskers as black as your boot and in
fact he was a pretty constant visitor at that gentlemans emporium
dealing with him largely for soaps and articles of perfumery which he
had at an exceedingly low rate Indeed he was never known to pay Mr
Eglantine one single shilling for those objects of luxury and having
them on such moderate terms was enabled to indulge in them pretty
copiously Thus Mr Walker was almost as great a nosegay as Mr
Eglantine himself his handkerchief was scented with verbena his hair
with jessamine and his coat had usually a fine perfume of cigars which
rendered his presence in a small room almost instantaneously remarkable
I have described Mr Walker thus accurately because in truth it
is more with characters than with astounding events that this little
history deals and Mr Walker is one of the principal of our dramatis
personae

And so having introduced Mr W we will walk over with him to Mr
Eglantines emporium where that gentleman is in waiting too to have
his likeness taken

There is about an acre of plate glass under the Royal arms on Mr
Eglantines shopwindow and at night when the gas is lighted and the
washballs are illuminated and the lambent flame plays fitfully over
numberless bottles of varicoloured perfumesnow flashes on a case
of razors and now lightens up a crystal vase containing a hundred
thousand of his patent toothbrushesthe effect of the sight may be
imagined You dont suppose that he is a creature who has those odious
simpering wax figures in his window that are called by the vulgar
dummies He is above such a wretched artifice and it is my belief
that he would as soon have his own head chopped off and placed as a
trunkless decoration to his shopwindow as allow a dummy to figure
there On one pane you read in elegant gold letters Eglantiniatis
his essence for the handkerchief on the other is written Regenerative
Unctiontis his invaluable pomatum for the hair

There is no doubt about it Eglantines knowledge of his profession
amounts to genius He sells a cake of soap for seven shillings for
which another man would not get a shilling and his toothbrushes go off
like wildfire at halfaguinea apiece If he has to administer rouge or
pearlpowder to ladies he does it with a mystery and fascination which
there is no resisting and the ladies believe there are no cosmetics
like his He gives his wares unheardof names and obtains for them sums
equally prodigious He CAN dress hairthat is a factas few men in
this age can and has been known to take twenty pounds in a single
night from as many of the first ladies of England when ringlets were in
fashion The introduction of bands he says made a difference of two
thousand pounds a year in his income and if there is one thing in the
world he hates and despises it is a Madonna Im not says he a
tradesmanIm a HARTIST Mr Eglantine was born in LondonIm a
hartist and show me a fine ead of air and Ill dress it for nothink
He vows that it was his way of dressing Mademoiselle Sontags hair that
caused the count her husband to fall in love with her and he has a lock
of it in a brooch and says it was the finest head he ever saw except
one and that was Morgiana Crumps

With his genius and his position in the profession how comes it then
that Mr Eglantine was not a man of fortune as many a less clever has
been If the truth must be told he loved pleasure and was in the hands
of the Jews He had been in business twenty years he had borrowed a
thousand pounds to purchase his stock and shop and he calculated that
he had paid upwards of twenty thousand pounds for the use of the one
thousand which was still as much due as on the first day when he
entered business He could show that he had received a thousand dozen
of champagne from the disinterested moneydealers with whom he usually
negotiated his paper He had pictures all over his studios which had
been purchased in the same bargains If he sold his goods at an enormous
price he paid for them at a rate almost equally exorbitant There
was not an article in his shop but came to him through his Israelite
providers and in the very front shop itself sat a gentleman who was the
nominee of one of them and who was called Mr Mossrose He was there to
superintend the cash account and to see that certain instalments were
paid to his principals according to certain agreements entered into
between Mr Eglantine and them

Having that sort of opinion of Mr Mossrose which Damocles may have had
of the sword which hung over his head of course Mr Eglantine hated his
foreman profoundly HE an artist would the former gentleman exclaim
why hes only a disguised bailiff Mossrose indeed The chaps names
Amos and he sold oranges before he came here Mr Mossrose on his
side utterly despised Mr Eglantine and looked forward to the day when
he would become the proprietor of the shop and take Eglantine for a
foreman and then it would HIS turn to sneer and bully and ride the
high horse

Thus it will be seen that there was a skeleton in the great perfumers
house as the saying is a worm in his hearts core and though to all
appearance prosperous he was really in an awkward position

What Mr Eglantines relations were with Mr Walker may be imagined from
the following dialogue which took place between the two gentlemen at
five oclock one summers afternoon when Mr Walker issuing from his
chambers came across to the perfumers shop

Is Eglantine at home Mr Mossrose said Walker to the foreman who
sat in the front shop

Dont knowgo and look meaning go and be hanged for Mossrose also
hated Mr Walker

If youre uncivil Ill break your bones Mr AMOS says Mr Walker
sternly

I should like to see you try Mr HOOKER Walker replies the undaunted
shopman on which the Captain looking several tremendous canings at
him walked into the back room or studio

How are you Tiny my buck says the Captain Much doing

Not a soul in town I avent touched the hirons all day replied Mr
Eglantine in rather a desponding way

Well just get them ready now and give my whiskers a turn Im going
to dine with Billingsgate and some outandout fellows at the Regent
and so my lad just do your best

I cant says Mr Eglantine I expect ladies Captain every minute

Very good I dont want to trouble such a great man Im sure
Goodbye and let me hear from you THIS DAY WEEK Mr Eglantine
This day week meant that at seven days from that time a certain bill
accepted by Mr Eglantine would be due and presented for payment

Dont be in such a hurry Captaindo sit down Ill curl you in one
minute And I say wont the party renew

Impossibleits the third renewal

But Ill make the thing handsome to youindeed I will

How much

Will ten pounds do the business

What offer my principal ten pounds Are you mad EglantineA little
more of the iron to the left whisker

No I meant for commission

Well Ill see if that will do The party I deal with Eglantine has
power I know and can defer the matter no doubt As for me you know
IVE nothing to do in the affair and only act as a friend between you
and him I give you my honour and soul I do

I know you do my dear sir The last two speeches were lies The
perfumer knew perfectly well that Mr Walker would pocket the ten
pounds but he was too easy to care for paying it and too timid to
quarrel with such a powerful friend And he had on three different
occasions already paid ten pounds fine for the renewal of the bill in
question all of which bonuses he knew went to his friend Mr Walker

Here too the reader will perceive what was in part the meaning of
the word Agency on Mr Walkers door He was a gobetween between
moneylenders and borrowers in this world and certain small sums always
remained with him in the course of the transaction He was an agent for
wine too an agent for places to be had through the influence of
great men he was an agent for halfadozen theatrical people male and
female and had the interests of the latter especially it was said
at heart Such were a few of the means by which this worthy gentleman
contrived to support himself and if as he was fond of high living
gambling and pleasures of all kinds his revenue was not large enough
for his expenditurewhy he got into debt and settled his bills that
way He was as much at home in the Fleet as in Pall Mall and quite as
happy in the one place as in the other Thats the way I take things
would this philosopher say If Ive money I spend if Ive credit
I borrow if Im dunned I whitewash and so you cant beat me down
Happy elasticity of temperament I do believe that in spite of his
misfortunes and precarious position there was no man in England whose
conscience was more calm and whose slumbers were more tranquil than
those of Captain Howard Walker

As he was sitting under the hands of Mr Eglantine he reverted to the
ladies whom the latter gentleman professed to expect said he was a
sly dog a lucky ditto and asked him if the ladies were handsome

Eglantine thought there could be no harm in telling a bouncer to a
gentleman with whom he was engaged in money transactions and so to
give the Captain an idea of his solvency and the brilliancy of his
future prospects Captain said he Ive got a hundred and eighty
pounds out with you which you were obliging enough to negotiate for me
Have I or have I not two bills out to that amount

Well my good fellow you certainly have and what then

What then Why I bet you five pounds to one that in three months
those bills are paid

Done five pounds to one I take it

This sudden closing with him made the perfumer rather uneasy but he was
not to pay for three months and so he said Done too and went on
What would you say if your bills were paid

Not mine Pikes

Well if Pikes were paid and the Minories man paid and every single
liability I have cleared off and that Mossrose flung out of winder and
me and my emporium as free as hair

You dont say so Is Queen Anne dead and has she left you a fortune
or whats the luck in the wind now

Its better than Queen Anne or anybody dying What should you say to
seeing in that very place where Mossrose now sits hang himseeing
the FINEST HEAD OF AIR NOW IN EUROPE A woman I tell youa
slapup lovely woman who Im proud to say will soon be called Mrs
Heglantine and will bring me five thousand pounds to her fortune

Well Tiny this IS good luck indeed I say youll be able to do a
bill or two for ME then hay You wont forget an old friend

That I wont I shall have a place at my board for you Capting and
manys the time I shall ope to see you under that maogany

What will the French milliner say Shell hang herself for despair
Eglantine

Hush not a word about ER Ive sown all my wild oats I tell you
Eglantine is no longer the gay young bachelor but the sober married
man I want a heart to share the feelings of mine I want repose Im
not so young as I was I feel it

Pooh pooh you areyou are

Well but I sigh for an appy fireside and Ill have it

And give up that club which you belong to hay

The Kidneys Oh of course no married man should belong to such
places at least ILL not and Ill have my kidneys broiled at home
But be quiet Captain if you please the ladies appointed to

And is it THE lady you expect eh you rogue

Well get along Its her and her Ma

But Mr Walker determined he wouldnt get along and would see these
lovely ladies before he stirred

The operation on Mr Walkers whiskers being concluded he was arranging
his toilet before the glass in an agreeable attitude his neck out
his enormous pin settled in his stock to his satisfaction his eyes
complacently directed towards the reflection of his left and favourite
whisker Eglantine was laid on a settee in an easy though melancholy
posture he was twiddling the tongs with which he had just operated on
Walker with one hand and his righthand ringlet with the other and he
was thinkingthinking of Morgiana and then of the bill which was to
become due on the 16th and then of a lightblue velvet waistcoat with
gold sprigs in which he looked very killing and so was trudging round
in his little circle of loves fears and vanities Hang it Mr
Walker was thinking I AM a handsome man A pair of whiskers like mine
are not met with every day If anybody can see that my tuft is dyed may
I be When the door was flung open and a large lady with a curl
on her forehead yellow shawl a greenvelvet bonnet with feathers
halfboots and a drab gown with tulips and other large exotics painted
on itwhen in a word Mrs Crump and her daughter bounced into the
room

Here we are Mr E cries Mrs Crump in a gay folatre confidential
air But law theres a gent in the room

Dont mind me ladies said the gent alluded to in his fascinating
way Im a friend of Eglantines aint I Egg a chip of the old
block hay

THAT you are said the perfumer starting up

An airdresser asked Mrs Crump Well I thought he was theres
something Mr E in gentlemen of your profession so exceeding so
uncommon distangy

Madam you do me proud replied the gentleman so complimented with
great presence of mind Will you allow me to try my skill upon you or
upon Miss your lovely daughter Im not so clever as Eglantine but no
bad hand I assure you

Nonsense Captain interrupted the perfumer who was uncomfortable
somehow at the rencontre between the Captain and the object of his
affection HES not in the profession Mrs C This is my friend
Captain Walker and proud I am to call him my friend And then aside to
Mrs C One of the first swells on town maama regular tiptopper

Humouring the mistake which Mrs Crump had just made Mr Walker thrust
the curlingirons into the fire in a minute and looked round at the
ladies with such a fascinating grace that both now made acquainted
with his quality blushed and giggled and were quite pleased Mamma
looked at Gina and Gina looked at mamma and then mamma gave Gina a
little blow in the region of her little waist and then both burst out
laughing as ladies will laugh and as let us trust they may laugh
for ever and ever Why need there be a reason for laughing Let us laugh
when we are laughy as we sleep when we are sleepy And so Mrs Crump
and her demoiselle laughed to their hearts content and both fixed
their large shining black eyes repeatedly on Mr Walker

I wont leave the room said he coming forward with the heated iron
in his hand and smoothing it on the brown paper with all the dexterity
of a professor for the fact is Mr W every morning curled his own
immense whiskers with the greatest skill and careI wont leave the
room Eglantine my boy My lady here took me for a hairdresser and so
you know Ive a right to stay

He cant stay said Mrs Crump all of a sudden blushing as red as a
peony

I shall have on my peignoir Mamma said Miss looking at the
gentleman and then dropping down her eyes and blushing too

But he cant stay Gina I tell you do you think that I would before
a gentleman take off my

Mamma means her FRONT said Miss jumping up and beginning to laugh
with all her might at which the honest landlady of the Bootjack who
loved a joke although at her own expense laughed too and said that no
one except Mr Crump and Mr Eglantine had ever seen her without the
ornament in question

DO go now you provoking thing you continued Miss C to Mr Walker
I wish to hear the hoverture and its six oclock now and we shall
never be done against then but the way in which Morgiana said DO go
clearly indicated dont to the perspicacious mind of Mr Walker

Perhaps you ad better go continued Mr Eglantine joining in this
sentiment and being in truth somewhat uneasy at the admiration which
his swell friend excited

Ill see you hanged first Eggy my boy Go I wont until these ladies
have had their hair dressed didnt you yourself tell me that Miss
Crumps was the most beautiful hair in Europe And do you think that
Ill go away without seeing it No here I stay

You naughty wicked odious provoking man said Miss Crump But at the
same time she took off her bonnet and placed it on one of the side
candlesticks of Mr Eglantines glass it was a blackvelvet bonnet
trimmed with sham lace and with a wreath of nasturtiums convolvuluses
and wallflowers within and then said Give me the peignoir Mr
Archibald if you please and Eglantine who would do anything for her
when she called him Archibald immediately produced that garment and
wrapped round the delicate shoulders of the lady who removing a sham
gold chain which she wore on her forehead two brass haircombs set with
glass rubies and the comb which kept her back hair togetherremoving
them I say and turning her great eyes towards the stranger and giving
her head a shake down let tumble such a flood of shining waving heavy
glossy jetty hair as would have done Mr Rowlands heart good to see
It tumbled down Miss Morgianas back and it tumbled over her shoulders
it tumbled over the chair on which she sat and from the midst of it her
jolly brighteyed rosy face beamed out with a triumphant smile which
said Ant I now the most angelic being you ever saw

By Heaven its the most beautiful thing I ever saw cried Mr Walker
with undisguised admiration

ISNT it said Mrs Crump who made her daughters triumph her own
Heigho when I acted at The Wells in 1820 before that dear girl was
born _I_ had such a head of hair as that to a shade sir to a shade
They called me Ravenswing on account of it I lost my head of hair when
that dear child was born and I often say to her Morgiana you came
into the world to rob your mother of her air Were you ever at The
Wells sir in 1820 Perhaps you recollect Miss Delancy I am that Miss
Delancy Perhaps you recollect

 Tinkatink tinkatink
 By the light of the star
 On the blue rivers brink
 I heard a guitar

 I heard a guitar
 On the blue waters clear
 And knew by its muusic
 That Selim was near

You remember that in the Bagdad Bells Fatima Delancy Selim
Benlomond his real name was Bunnion and he failed poor fellow in
the public line afterwards It was done to the tambourine and dancing
between each verse

 Tinkatink tinkatink
 How the soft music swells
 And I hear the soft clink
 Of the minaret bells

 Tinka

Oh here cried Miss Crump as if in exceeding pain and whether Mr
Eglantine had twitched pulled or hurt any one individual hair of that
lovely head I dont knowOh you are killing me Mr Eglantine

And with this mamma who was in her attitude holding up the end of her
boa as a visionary tambourine and Mr Walker who was looking at her
and in his amusement at the mothers performances had almost forgotten
the charms of the daughterboth turned round at once and looked at
her with many expressions of sympathy while Eglantine in a voice of
reproach said KILLED you Morgiana I kill YOU

Im better now said the young lady with a smileIm better Mr
Archibald now And if the truth must be told no greater coquette than
Miss Morgiana existed in all Mayfairno not among the most fashionable
mistresses of the fashionable valets who frequented the Bootjack She
believed herself to be the most fascinating creature that the world ever
produced she never saw a stranger but she tried these fascinations upon
him and her charms of manner and person were of that showy sort which
is most popular in this world where people are wont to admire most that
which gives them the least trouble to see and so you will find a tulip
of a woman to be in fashion when a little humble violet or daisy of
creation is passed over without remark Morgiana was a tulip among
women and the tulip fanciers all came flocking round her

Well the said Oh and Im better now Mr Archibald thereby
succeeded in drawing everybodys attention to her lovely self By the
latter words Mr Eglantine was specially inflamed he glanced at Mr
Walker and said Capting didnt I tell you she was a CREECHER See
her hair sir its as black and as glossy as satting It weighs fifteen
pound that hair sir and I wouldnt let my apprenticethat blundering
Mossrose for instance hang himI wouldnt let anyone but myself
dress that hair for five hundred guineas Ah Miss Morgiana remember
that you MAY ALWAYS have Eglantine to dress your hairremember that
thats all And with this the worthy gentleman began rubbing delicately
a little of the Eglantinia into those ambrosial locks which he loved
with all the love of a man and an artist

And as for Morgiana showing her hair I hope none of my readers will
entertain a bad opinion of the poor girl for doing so Her locks were
her pride she acted at the private theatre hair parts where she
could appear on purpose to show them in a dishevelled state and that
her modesty was real and not affected may be proved by the fact that
when Mr Walker stepping up in the midst of Eglantines last speech
took hold of a lock of her hair very gently with his hand she cried
Oh and started with all her might And Mr Eglantine observed
very gravely Capting Miss Crumps hair is to be seen and not to be
touched if you please

No more it is Mr Eglantine said her mamma And now as its come
to my turn I beg the gentleman will be so obliging as to go

MUST I cried Mr Walker and as it was halfpast six and he was
engaged to dinner at the Regent Club and as he did not wish to make
Eglantine jealous who evidently was annoyed by his staying he took his
hat just as Miss Crumps coiffure was completed and saluting her and
her mamma left the room

A tiptop swell I can assure you said Eglantine nodding after him
a regular bangup chap and no MISTAKE Intimate with the Marquess of
Billingsgate and Lord Vauxhall and that set

Hes very genteel said Mrs Crump

Law Im sure I think nothing of him said Morgiana

And Captain Walker walked towards his club meditating on the beauties
of Morgiana What hair said he what eyes the girl has theyre as
big as billiardballs and five thousand pounds Eglantines in luck
five thousand poundsshe cant have it its impossible

No sooner was Mrs Crumps front arranged during the time of which
operation Morgiana sat in perfect contentment looking at the last French
fashions in the Courrier des Dames and thinking how her pink satin
slip would dye and make just such a mantilla as that represented in the
engravingno sooner was Mrs Crumps front arranged than both ladies
taking leave of Mr Eglantine tripped back to the Bootjack Hotel in
the neighbourhood where a very neat green fly was already in waiting
the gentleman on the box of which from a liverystable in the
neighbourhood gave a knowing touch to his hat and a salute with his
whip to the two ladies as they entered the tavern

Mr Ws inside said the mana driver from Mr Snaffles
establishment hes been in and out this score of times and looking
down the street for you And in the house in fact was Mr Woolsey
the tailor who had hired the fly and was engaged to conduct the ladies
that evening to the play

It was really rather too bad to think that Miss Morgiana after going to
one lover to have her hair dressed should go with another to the play
but such is the way with lovely woman Let her have a dozen admirers
and the dear coquette will exercise her power upon them all and as a
lady when she has a large wardrobe and a taste for variety in dress
will appear every day in a different costume so will the young and
giddy beauty wear her lovers encouraging now the black whiskers now
smiling on the brown now thinking that the gay smiling rattle of an
admirer becomes her very well and now adopting the sad sentimental
melancholy one according as her changeful fancy prompts her Let us not
be too angry with these uncertainties and caprices of beauty and depend
on it that for the most part those females who cry out loudest against
the flightiness of their sisters and rebuke their undue encouragement
of this man or that would do as much themselves if they had the chance
and are constant as I am to my coat just now because I have no other

Did you see Doubleyou Gina dear said her mamma addressing that
young lady Hes in the bar with your Pa and has his military coat
with the kings buttons and looks like an officer

This was Mr Woolseys style his great aim being to look like an army
gent for many of whom he in his capacity of tailor made those splendid
red and blue coats which characterise our military As for the royal
button had not he made a set of coats for his late Majesty George
IV and he would add when he narrated this circumstance Sir Prince
Blucher and Prince Swartzenbergs measures in the house now and whats
more Ive cut for Wellington I believe he would have gone to St
Helena to make a coat for Napoleon so great was his ardour He wore a
blueblack wig and his whiskers were of the same hue He was brief and
stern in conversations and he always went to masquerades and balls in a
fieldmarshals uniform

He looks really quite the thing tonight continued Mrs Crump

Yes said Gina but hes such an odious wig and the dye of his
whiskers always comes off on his white gloves

Everybody has not their own hair love continued Mrs Crump with a
sigh but Eglantines is beautiful

Every hairdressers is answered Morgiana rather contemptuously
but what I cant bear is that their fingers is always so very fat and
pudgy

In fact something had gone wrong with the fair Morgiana Was it that
she had but little liking for the one pretender or the other Was it
that young Glauber who acted Romeo in the private theatricals was far
younger and more agreeable than either Or was it that seeing a
REAL GENTLEMAN such as Mr Walker with whom she had had her first
interview she felt more and more the want of refinement in her other
declared admirers Certain however it is that she was very reserved
all the evening in spite of the attentions of Mr Woolsey that she
repeatedly looked round at the boxdoor as if she expected someone to
enter and that she partook of only a very few oysters indeed out of
the barrel which the gallant tailor had sent down to the Bootjack and
off which the party supped

What is it said Mr Woolsey to his ally Crump as they sat together
after the retirement of the ladies She was dumb all night She never
once laughed at the farce nor cried at the tragedy and you know she
laughs and cries uncommon She only took half her negus and not above a
quarter of her beer

No more she did replied Mr Crump very calmly I think it must
be the barber as has been captivating her he dressed her hair for the
play

Hang him Ill shoot him said Mr Woolsey A fat foolish effeminate
beast like that marry Miss Morgiana Never I WILL shoot him Ill
provoke him next SaturdayIll tread on his toeIll pull his nose

No quarrelling at the Kidneys answered Crump sternly there shall
be no quarrelling in that room as long as Im in the chair


Well at any rate youll stand my friend

You know I will answered the other You are honourable and I like
you better than Eglantine I trust you more than Eglantine sir Youre
more of a man than Eglantine though you ARE a tailor and I wish with
all my heart you may get Morgiana Mrs C goes the other way I know
but I tell you what women will go their own ways sir and Morgys
like her mother in this point and depend upon it Morgy will decide for
herself

Mr Woolsey presently went home still persisting in his plan for the
assassination of Eglantine Mr Crump went to bed very quietly and
snored through the night in his usual tone Mr Eglantine passed some
feverish moments of jealousy for he had come down to the club in the
evening and had heard that Morgiana was gone to the play with his
rival And Miss Morgiana dreamed of a man who wasmust we say
itexceedingly like Captain Howard Walker Mrs Captain Soandso
thought she Oh I do love a gentleman dearly

And about this time too Mr Walker himself came rolling home from
the Regent hiccupping Such hairsuch eyebrowssuch eyes like
bbbilliardballs by Jove



CHAPTER II IN WHICH MR WALKER MAKES THREE ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN THE
DWELLING OF MORGIANA

The day after the dinner at the Regent Club Mr Walker stepped over
to the shop of his friend the perfumer where as usual the young man
Mr Mossrose was established in the front premises

For some reason or other the Captain was particularly goodhumoured
and quite forgetful of the words which had passed between him and Mr
Eglantines lieutenant the day before began addressing the latter with
extreme cordiality

A good morning to you Mr Mossrose said Captain Walker Why sir
you look as fresh as your namesakeyou do indeed now Mossrose

You look ash yellow ash a guinea responded Mr Mossrose sulkily He
thought the Captain was hoaxing him

My good sir replies the other nothing cast down I drank rather too
freely last night

The more beast you said Mr Mossrose

Thank you Mossrose the same to you answered the Captain

If you call me a beast Ill punch your head off answered the young
man who had much skill in the art which many of his brethren practise

I didnt my fine fellow replied Walker On the contrary you

Do you mean to give me the lie broke out the indignant Mossrose who
hated the agent fiercely and did not in the least care to conceal his
hate

In fact it was his fixed purpose to pick a quarrel with Walker and to
drive him if possible from Mr Eglantines shop Do you mean to give
me the lie I say Mr Hooker Walker

For Heavens sake Amos hold your tongue exclaimed the Captain to
whom the name of Hooker was as poison but at this moment a customer
stepping in Mr Amos exchanged his ferocious aspect for a bland grin
and Mr Walker walked into the studio

When in Mr Eglantines presence Walker too was all smiles in a
minute sank down on a settee held out his hand to the perfumer and
began confidentially discoursing with him

SUCH a dinner Tiny my boy said he such prime fellows to eat
it too Billingsgate Vauxhall Cinqbars Buff of the Blues and
halfadozen more of the best fellows in town And what do you think the
dinner cost a head Ill wager youll never guess

Was it two guineas a headIn course I mean without wine said the
genteel perfumer

Guess again

Well was it ten guineas a head Ill guess any sum you please
replied Mr Eglantine for I know that when you NOBS are together you
dont spare your money I myself at the Star and Garter at Richmond
once paid

Eighteenpence

Heighteenpence sirI paid fiveandthirty shillings per ead Id
have you to know that I can act as a gentleman as well as any other
gentleman sir answered the perfumer with much dignity

Well eighteenpence was what WE paid and not a rap more upon my
honour

Nonsense youre joking The Marquess of Billinsgate dine for
eighteenpence Why hang it if I was a marquess Id pay a fivepound
note for my lunch

You little know the person Master Eglantine replied the Captain
with a smile of contemptuous superiority you little know the real
man of fashion my good fellow Simplicity sirsimplicitys the
characteristic of the real gentleman and so Ill tell you what we had
for dinner

Turtle and venison of courseno nob dines without THEM

Psha were sick of em We had pea soup and boiled tripe What do you
think of THAT We had sprats and herrings a bullocks heart a baked
shoulder of mutton and potatoes pigsfry and Irish stew _I_ ordered
the dinner sir and got more credit for inventing it than they ever
gave to Ude or Soyer The Marquess was in ecstasies the Earl devoured
half a bushel of sprats and if the Viscount is not laid up with a
surfeit of bullocks heart my names not Howard Walker Billy as I
call him was in the chair and gave my health and what do you think
the rascal proposed

What DID his Lordship propose

That every man present should subscribe twopence and pay for my share
of the dinner By Jove it is true and the money was handed to me in
a pewterpot of which they also begged to make me a present We
afterwards went to Tom Springs from Toms to the Finish from the
Finish to the watchhousethat is THEY didand sent for me just as
I was getting into bed to bail them all out

Theyre happy dogs those young noblemen said Mr Eglantine nothing
but pleasure from morning till night no affectation neitherno HOTURE
but manly downright straightforward good fellows

Should you like to meet them Tiny my boy said the Captain

If I did sir I hope I should show myself to be gentleman answered
Mr Eglantine

Well you SHALL meet them and Lady Billingsgate shall order her
perfumes at your shop We are going to dine next week all our set
at Mealyfaced Bobs and you shall be my guest cried the Captain
slapping the delighted artist on the back And now my boy tell me how
YOU spent the evening

At my club sir answered Mr Eglantine blushing rather

What not at the play with the lovely blackeyed MissWhat is her
name Eglantine

Never mind her name Captain replied Eglantine partly from prudence
and partly from shame He had not the heart to own it was Crump and he
did not care that the Captain should know more of his destined bride

You wish to keep the five thousand to yourselfeh you rogue
responded the Captain with a goodhumoured air although exceedingly
mortified for to say the truth he had put himself to the trouble
of telling the above long story of the dinner and of promising to
introduce Eglantine to the lords solely that he might elicit from that
gentlemans goodhumour some further particulars regarding the young
lady with the billiardball eyes It was for the very same reason too
that he had made the attempt at reconciliation with Mr Mossrose which
had just so signally failed Nor would the reader did he know Mr W
better at all require to have the above explanation but as yet we are
only at the first chapter of his history and who is to know what the
heros motives can be unless we take the trouble to explain

Well the little dignified answer of the worthy dealer in bergamot
NEVER MIND HER NAME CAPTAIN threw the gallant Captain quite aback
and though he sat for a quarter of an hour longer and was exceedingly
kind and though he threw out some skilful hints yet the perfumer was
quite unconquerable or rather he was too frightened to tell the
poor fat timid easy goodnatured gentleman was always the prey of
roguespanting and floundering in one rascals snare or anothers He
had the dissimulation too which timid men have and felt the presence
of a victimiser as a hare does of a greyhound Now he would be quite
still now he would double and now he would run and then came the end
He knew by his sure instinct of fear that the Captain had in asking
these questions a scheme against him and so he was cautious and
trembled and doubted And oh how he thanked his stars when Lady
Grogmores chariot drove up with the Misses Grogmore who wanted their
hair dressed and were going to a breakfast at three oclock

Ill look in again Tiny said the Captain on hearing the summons

DO Captain said the other THANK YOU and went into the ladys
studio with a heavy heart

Get out of the way you infernal villain roared the Captain with
many oaths to Lady Grogmores large footman with rubycoloured tights
who was standing inhaling the ten thousand perfumes of the shop and the
latter moving away in great terror the gallant agent passed out quite
heedless of the grin of Mr Mossrose

Walker was in a fury at his want of success and walked down Bond Street
in a fury I WILL know where the girl lives swore he Ill spend a
fivepound note by Jove rather than not know where she lives

THAT YOU WOULDI KNOW YOU WOULD said a little grave low voice all
of a sudden by his side Pooh whats money to you

Walker looked down it was Tom Dale

Who in London did not know little Tom Dale He had cheeks like an apple
and his hair curled every morning and a little blue stock and always
two new magazines under his arm and an umbrella and a little brown
frockcoat and big squaretoed shoes with which he went PAPPING down
the street He was everywhere at once Everybody met him every day and
he knew everything that everybody ever did though nobody ever knew what
HE did He was they say a hundred years old and had never dined at
his own charge once in those hundred years He looked like a figure out
of a waxwork with glassy clear meaningless eyes he always spoke with
a grin he knew what you had for dinner the day before he met you and
what everybody had had for dinner for a century back almost He was
the receptacle of all the scandal of all the world from Bond Street
to Bread Street he knew all the authors all the actors all the
notorieties of the town and the private histories of each That is
he never knew anything really but supplied deficiencies of truth and
memory with readycoined neverfailing lies He was the most benevolent
man in the universe and never saw you without telling you everything
most cruel of your neighbour and when he left you he went to do the
same kind turn by yourself

Pooh whats money to you my dear boy said little Tom Dale who had
just come out of Eberss where he had been filching an operaticket
You make it in bushels in the City you know you doin thousands
I saw you go into Eglantines Fine business that finest in London
Fiveshilling cakes of soap my dear boy I cant wash with such
Thousands a year that man has madehasnt he

Upon my word Tom I dont know says the Captain

YOU not know Dont tell me You know everythingyou agents You KNOW
he makes five thousand a yearay and might make ten but you know why
he dont

Indeed I dont

Nonsense Dont humbug a poor old fellow like me JewsAmosfifty per
cent ay Why cant he get his money from a good Christian

I HAVE heard something of that sort said Walker laughing Why by
Jove Tom you know everything

YOU know everything my dear boy You know what a rascally trick that
opera creature served him poor fellow Cashmere shawlsStorr and
MortimersStar and Garter Much better dine quiet off peasoup and
spratsay His betters have as you know very well

Peasoup and sprats What have you heard of that already

Who bailed Lord Billingsgate hey you rogue and here Tom gave a
knowing and almost demoniacal grin Who wouldnt go to the Finish
Who had the piece of plate presented to him filled with sovereigns And
you deserved it my dear boyyou deserved it They said it was only
halfpence but I know better and here Tom went off in a cough

I say Tom cried Walker inspired with a sudden thought you who
know everything and are a theatrical man did you ever know a Miss
Delancy an actress

At Sadlers Wells in 16 Of course I did Real name was Budge Lord
Slapper admired her very much my dear boy She married a man by the
name of Crump his Lordships black footman and brought him five
thousand pounds and they keep the Bootjack publichouse in Bunkers
Buildings and theyve got fourteen children Is one of them handsome
eh you sly rogueand is it that which you will give five pounds to
know God bless you my dear dear boy Jones my dear friend how are
you

And now seizing on Jones Tom Dale left Mr Walker alone and proceeded
to pour into Mr Joness ear an account of the individual whom he had
just quitted how he was the best fellow in the world and Jones KNEW
it how he was in a fine way of making his fortune how he had been in
the Fleet many times and how he was at this moment employed in looking
out for a young lady of whom a certain great marquess whom Jones knew
very well too had expressed an admiration

But for these observations which he did not hear Captain Walker it
may be pronounced did not care His eyes brightened up he marched
quickly and gaily away and turning into his own chambers opposite
Eglantines shop saluted that establishment with a grin of triumph
You wouldnt tell me her name wouldnt you said Mr Walker Well
the lucks with me now and here goes

Two days after as Mr Eglantine with white gloves and a case of
eaudeCologne as a present in his pocket arrived at the Bootjack
Hotel Little Bunkers Buildings Berkeley Square for it must
outthat was the place in which Mr Crumps inn was situated
he paused for a moment at the threshold of the little house of
entertainment and listened with beating heart to the sound of
delicious music that a wellknown voice was uttering within

The moon was playing in silvery brightness down the gutter of the humble
street A helper rubbing down one of Lady Smigsmags carriagehorses
even paused in his whistle to listen to the strain Mr Tressles man
who had been professionally occupied ceased his taptap upon the coffin
which he was getting in readiness The greengrocer there is always a
greengrocer in those narrow streets and he goes out in white Berlin
gloves as a supernumerary footman was standing charmed at his little
green gate the cobbler there is always a cobbler too was drunk as
usual of evenings but with unusual subordination never sang except
when the refrain of the ditty arrived when he hiccupped it forth with
tipsy loyalty and Eglantine leaned against the chequers painted on
the doorside under the name of Crump and looked at the red illumined
curtain of the bar and the vast wellknown shadow of Mrs Crumps
turban within Now and again the shadow of that worthy matrons hand
would be seen to grasp the shadow of a bottle then the shadow of a
cup would rise towards the turban and still the strain proceeded
Eglantine I say took out his yellow bandanna and brushed the beady
drops from his brow and laid the contents of his white kids on his
heart and sighed with ecstatic sympathy The song began

 Come to the greenwood tree 1
 Come where the dark woods be
 Dearest O come with me
 Let us roveO my loveO my love
 O myy love

Drunken Cobbler without
 O myy love

Beast says Eglantine

 Cometis the moonlight hour
 Dew is on leaf and flower
 Come to the linden bower
 Let us roveO my loveO my love
 Let us rooove lurlurliety yes well rove lurlurliety
 Through the grooove lurlurlietylurlurlieieiei

Cobbler as usual
 Let us rooove etc

YOU here says another individual coming clinking up the street in
a militarycut dresscoat the buttons whereof shone very bright in the
moonlight YOU here EglantineYoure always here

Hush Woolsey said Mr Eglantine to his rival the tailor for he
was the individual in question and Woolsey accordingly put his
back against the opposite doorpost and chequers so that with poor
Eglantines bulk nothing much thicker than a sheet of paper could pass
out or in And thus these two amorous caryatides kept guard as the song
continued

 Dark is the wood and wide
 Dangers they say betide
 But at my Alberts side
 Nought I fear O my loveO my love

 Welcome the greenwood tree
 Welcome the forest tree
 Dearest with thee with thee
 Nought I fear O my loveO maay love

Eglantines fine eyes were filled with tears as Morgiana passionately
uttered the above beautiful words Little Woolseys eyes glistened as
he clenched his fist with an oath and said Show me any singing that
can beat THAT Cobbler shut your mouth or Ill break your head

But the cobbler regardless of the threat continued to perform the
Lurlurliety with great accuracy and when that was ended both on his
part and Morgianas a rapturous knocking of glasses was heard in the
little bar then a great clapping of hands and finally somebody shouted
Brava

Brava

At that word Eglantine turned deadly pale then gave a start then a
rush forward which pinned or rather cushioned the tailor against the
wall then twisting himself abruptly round he sprang to the door of the
bar and bounced into that apartment

HOW ARE YOU MY NOSEGAY exclaimed the same voice which had shouted
Brava It was that of Captain Walker

At ten oclock the next morning a gentleman with the Kings button
on his military coat walked abruptly into Mr Eglantines shop and
turning on Mr Mossrose said Tell your master I want to see him

Hes in his studio said Mr Mossrose

Well then fellow go and fetch him

And Mossrose thinking it must be the Lord Chamberlain or Doctor
Praetorius at least walked into the studio where the perfumer was
seated in a very glossy old silk dressinggown his fair hair hanging
over his white face his double chin over his flaccid whitybrown
shirtcollar his peagreen slippers on the hob and on the fire the pot
of chocolate which was simmering for his breakfast A lazier fellow
than poor Eglantine it would be hard to find whereas on the contrary
Woolsey was always up and brushed spickandspan at seven oclock and
had gone through his books and given out the work for the journeymen
and eaten a hearty breakfast of rashers of bacon before Eglantine had
put the usual pound of grease to his hair his fingers were always as
damp and shiny as if he had them in a pomatumpot and arranged his
figure for the day

Heres a gent wants you in the shop says Mr Mossrose leaving the
door of communication wide open

Say Im in bed Mr Mossrose Im out of sperrets and really can see
nobody

Its someone from Vindsor I think hes got the royal button says
Mossrose

Its meWoolsey shouted the little man from the shop

Mr Eglantine at this jumped up made a rush to the door leading to his
private apartment and disappeared in a twinkling But it must not be
imagined that he fled in order to avoid Mr Woolsey He only went away
for one minute just to put on his belt for he was ashamed to be seen
without it by his rival

This being assumed and his toilet somewhat arranged Mr Woolsey was
admitted into his private room And Mossrose would have heard every
word of the conversation between those two gentlemen had not Woolsey
opening the door suddenly pounced on the assistant taken him by
the collar and told him to disappear altogether into the shop which
Mossrose did vowing he would have his revenge

The subject on which Woolsey had come to treat was an important one
Mr Eglantine says he theres no use disguising from one another
that we are both of us in love with Miss Morgiana and that our chances
up to this time have been pretty equal But that Captain whom you
introduced like an ass as you were

An ass Mr Woolsey Id have you to know sir that Im no more a hass
than you are sir and as for introducing the Captain I did no such
thing

Well well hes got apoaching into our preserves somehow Hes
evidently sweet upon the young woman and is a more fashionable chap
than either of us two We must get him out of the house sirwe must
circumwent him and THEN Mr Eglantine will be time enough for you and
me to try which is the best man

HE the best man thought Eglantine the little bald unsightly
tailorcreature A man with no more soul than his smoothinghiron The
perfumer as may be imagined did not utter this sentiment aloud but
expressed himself quite willing to enter into any HAMICABLE arrangement
by which the new candidate for Miss Crumps favour must be thrown over
It was accordingly agreed between the two gentlemen that they should
coalesce against the common enemy that they should by reciting many
perfectly wellfounded stories in the Captains disfavour influence the
minds of Miss Crumps parents and of herself if possible against this
wolf in sheeps clothing and that when they were once fairly rid of
him each should be at liberty as before to prefer his own claim

I have thought of a subject said the little tailor turning very red
and hemming and hawing a great deal Ive thought I say of a pint
which may be resorted to with advantage at the present juncture and in
which each of us may be useful to the other An exchange Mr Eglantine
do you take

Do you mean an accommodationbill said Eglantine whose mind ran a
good deal on that species of exchange

Pooh nonsense sir The name of OUR firm is I flatter myself a
little more up in the market than some other peoples names

Do you mean to insult the name of Archibald Eglantine sir Id have
you to know that at three months

Nonsense says Mr Woolsey mastering his emotion Theres no use
aquarrelling Mr E were not in love with each other I know that
You wish me hanged or as good I know that

Indeed I dont sir

You do sir I tell you you do and whats more I wish the same
to youtransported at any rate But as two sailors when a boats
asinking though they hate each other ever so much will help and bale
the boat out so sir let US act let us be the two sailors

Bail sir said Eglantine as usual mistaking the drift of the
argument Ill bail no man If youre in difficulties I think you had
better go to your senior partner Mr Woolsey And Eglantines cowardly
little soul was filled with a savage satisfaction to think that his
enemy was in distress and actually obliged to come to HIM for succour

Youre enough to make Job swear you great fat stupid lazy old barber
roared Mr Woolsey in a fury

Eglantine jumped up and made for the bellrope The gallant little
tailor laughed

Theres no need to call in Betsy said he Im not agoing to eat
you Eglantine youre a bigger man than me if you were just to fall on
me youd smother me Just sit still on the sofa and listen to reason

Well sir proceed said the barber with a gasp

Now listen Whats the darling wish of your heart I know it sir
youve told it to Mr Tressle sir and other gents at the club The
darling wish of your heart sir is to have a slapup coat turned out of
the ateliers of Messrs Linsey Woolsey and Company You said youd give
twenty guineas for one of our coats you know you did Lord Bolstertons
a fatter man than you and look what a figure we turn HIM out Can any
firm in England dress Lord Bolsterton but us so as to make his Lordship
look decent I defy em sir We could have given Daniel Lambert a
figure

If I want a coat sir said Mr Eglantine and I dont deny it
theres some people want a HEAD OF HAIR

Thats the very point I was coming to said the tailor resuming the
violent blush which was mentioned as having suffused his countenance
at the beginning of the conversation Let us have terms of mutual
accommodation Make me a wig Mr Eglantine and though I never yet cut
a yard of cloth except for a gentleman Ill pledge you my word Ill
make you a coat

WILL you honour bright says Eglantine

Honour bright says the tailor Look and in an instant he drew
from his pocket one of those slips of parchment which gentlemen of his
profession carry and putting Eglantine into the proper position began
to take the preliminary observations He felt Eglantines heart
thump with happiness as his measure passed over that soft part of the
perfumers person

Then pulling down the windowblind and looking that the door was
locked and blushing still more deeply than ever the tailor seated
himself in an armchair towards which Mr Eglantine beckoned him and
taking off his black wig exposed his head to the great perruquiers
gaze Mr Eglantine looked at it measured it manipulated it sat
for three minutes with his head in his hand and his elbow on his knee
gazing at the tailors cranium with all his might walked round it twice
or thrice and then said Its enough Mr Woolsey Consider the job
as done And now sir said he with a greatly relieved airand now
Woolsey let us ave a glass of curacoa to celebrate this hauspicious
meeting

The tailor however stiffly replied that he never drank in a morning
and left the room without offering to shake Mr Eglantine by the hand
for he despised that gentleman very heartily and himself too for
coming to any compromise with him and for so far demeaning himself as
to make a coat for a barber

Looking from his chambers on the other side of the street that
inevitable Mr Walker saw the tailor issuing from the perfumers shop
and was at no loss to guess that something extraordinary must be in
progress when two such bitter enemies met together



CHAPTER III WHAT CAME OF MR WALKERS DISCOVERY OF THE BOOTJACK

It is very easy to state how the Captain came to take up that proud
position at the Bootjack which we have seen him occupy on the evening
when the sound of the fatal Brava so astonished Mr Eglantine

The mere entry into the establishment was of course not difficult Any
person by simply uttering the words A pint of beer was free of the
Bootjack and it was some such watchword that Howard Walker employed
when he made his first appearance He requested to be shown into a
parlour where he might repose himself for a while and was ushered into
that very sanctum where the Kidney Club met Then he stated that the
beer was the best he had ever tasted except in Bavaria and in some
parts of Spain he added and professing to be extremely peckish
requested to know if there were any cold meat in the house whereof he
could make a dinner

I dont usually dine at this hour landlord said he flinging down
a halfsovereign for payment of the beer but your parlour looks so
comfortable and the Windsor chairs are so snug that Im sure I could
not dine better at the first club in London

ONE of the first clubs in London is held in this very room said Mr
Crump very well pleased and attended by some of the best gents in
town too We call it the Kidney Club

Why bless my soul it is the very club my friend Eglantine has so
often talked to me about and attended by some of the tiptop tradesmen
of the metropolis

Theres better men here than Mr Eglantine replied Mr Crump though
hes a good manI dont say hes not a good manbut theres better
Mr Clinker sir Mr Woolsey of the house of Linsey Woolsey and Co

The great armyclothiers cried Walker the first house in town
and so continued with exceeding urbanity holding conversation with Mr
Crump until the honest landlord retired delighted and told Mrs Crump
in the bar that there was a tiptop swell in the Kidney parlour who
was agoing to have his dinner there

Fortune favoured the brave Captain in every way It was just Mr Crumps
own dinnerhour and on Mrs Crump stepping into the parlour to ask the
guest whether he would like a slice of the joint to which the family
were about to sit down fancy that ladys start of astonishment at
recognising Mr Eglantines facetious friend of the day before The
Captain at once demanded permission to partake of the joint at the
family table the lady could not with any great reason deny this
request the Captain was inducted into the bar and Miss Crump who
always came down late for dinner was even more astonished than her
mamma on beholding the occupier of the fourth place at the table Had
she expected to see the fascinating stranger so soon again I think she
had Her big eyes said as much as furtively looking up at Mr Walkers
face they caught his looks and then bouncing down again towards her
plate pretended to be very busy in looking at the boiled beef and
carrots there displayed She blushed far redder than those carrots but
her shining ringlets hid her confusion together with her lovely face

Sweet Morgiana the billiardball eyes had a tremendous effect on the
Captain They fell plump as it were into the pocket of his heart and
he gallantly proposed to treat the company to a bottle of champagne
which was accepted without much difficulty

Mr Crump under pretence of going to the cellar where he said he had
some cases of the finest champagne in Europe called Dick the boy
to him and despatched him with all speed to a wine merchants where a
couple of bottles of the liquor were procured

Bring up two bottles Mr C Captain Walker gallantly said when Crump
made his move as it were to the cellar and it may be imagined after
the two bottles were drunk of which Mrs Crump took at least nine
glasses to her share how happy merry and confidential the whole
party had become Crump told his story of the Bootjack and whose boot
it had drawn the former Miss Delancy expatiated on her past theatrical
life and the pictures hanging round the room Miss was equally
communicative and in short the Captain had all the secrets of the
little family in his possession ere sunset He knew that Miss cared
little for either of her suitors about whom mamma and papa had a little
quarrel He heard Mrs Crump talk of Morgianas property and fell more
in love with her than ever Then came tea the luscious crumpet the
quiet game at cribbage and the songthe song which poor Eglantine
heard and which caused Woolseys rage and his despair

At the close of the evening the tailor was in a greater rage and the
perfumer in greater despair than ever He had made his little present
of eaudeCologne Oh fie says the Captain with a horselaugh it
SMELLS OF THE SHOP He taunted the tailor about his wig and the honest
fellow had only an oath to give by way of repartee He told his stories
about his club and his lordly friends What chance had either against
the allaccomplished Howard Walker

Old Crump with a good innate sense of right and wrong hated the man
Mrs Crump did not feel quite at her ease regarding him but Morgiana
thought him the most delightful person the world ever produced

Eglantines usual morning costume was a blue satin neckcloth
embroidered with butterflies and ornamented with a brandyball brooch a
light shawl waistcoat and a rhubarbcoloured coat of the sort which I
believe are called Taglionis and which have no waistbuttons and made
a pretence as it were to have no waists but are in reality adopted by
the fat in order to give them a waist Nothing easier for an obese man
than to have a waist he has but to pinch his middle part a little and
the very fat on either side pushed violently forward MAKES a waist
as it were and our worthy perfumers figure was that of a bolster cut
almost in two with a string

Walker presently saw him at his shopdoor grinning in this costume
twiddling his ringlets with his dumpy greasy fingers glittering with
oil and rings and looking so exceedingly contented and happy that the
estateagent felt assured some very satisfactory conspiracy had been
planned between the tailor and him How was Mr Walker to learn what the
scheme was Alas the poor fellows vanity and delight were such that
he could not keep silent as to the cause of his satisfaction and rather
than not mention it at all in the fulness of his heart he would have
told his secret to Mr Mossrose himself

When I get my coat thought the Bond Street Alnaschar Ill hire
of Snaffle that easygoing creamcoloured oss that he bought from
Astleys and Ill canter through the Park and WONT I pass through
Little Bunkers Buildings thats all Ill wear my grey trousers with
the velvet stripe down the side and get my spurs lacquered up and a
French polish to my boot and if I dont DO for the Captain and the
tailor too my names not Archibald And I know what Ill do Ill hire
the small clarence and invite the Crumps to dinner at the Gar and
Starter this was his facetious way of calling the Star and Garter
and Ill ride by them all the way to Richmond Its rather a long ride
but with Snaffles soft saddle I can do it pretty easy I dare say And
so the honest fellow built castles upon castles in the air and the last
most beautiful vision of all was Miss Crump in white satting with a
horange flower in her air putting him in possession of her lovely
and before the haltar of St Georges Anover Square As for Woolsey
Eglantine determined that he should have the best wig his art could
produce for he had not the least fear of his rival

These points then being arranged to the poor fellows satisfaction what
does he do but send out for half a quire of pink notepaper and in a
filagree envelope despatch a note of invitation to the ladies at the
Bootjack


BOWER OF BLOOM BOND STREET

Thursday

MR ARCHIBALD EGLANTINE presents his compliments to Mrs and Miss
Crump and requests the HONOUR AND PLEASURE of their company at the
Star and Garter at Richmond to an early dinner on Sunday next

IF AGREEABLE Mr Eglantines carriage will be at your door at three
oclock and I propose to accompany them on horseback if agreeable
likewise


This note was sealed with yellow wax and sent to its destination and
of course Mr Eglantine went himself for the answer in the evening and
of course he told the ladies to look out for a certain new coat he was
going to sport on Sunday and of course Mr Walker happens to call the
next day with spare tickets for Mrs Crump and her daughter when the
whole secret was laid bare to himhow the ladies were going to Richmond
on Sunday in Mr Snaffles clarence and how Mr Eglantine was to ride
by their side

Mr Walker did not keep horses of his own his magnificent friends at
the Regent had plenty in their stables and some of these were at
livery at the establishment of the Captains old college companion
Mr Snaffle It was easy therefore for the Captain to renew his
acquaintance with that individual So hanging on the arm of my Lord
Vauxhall Captain Walker next day made his appearance at Snaffles
liverystables and looked at the various horses there for sale or
at bait and soon managed by putting some facetious questions to Mr
Snaffle regarding the Kidney Club etc to place himself on a friendly
footing with that gentleman and to learn from him what horse Mr
Eglantine was to ride on Sunday

The monster Walker had fully determined in his mind that Eglantine
should FALL off that horse in the course of his Sundays ride

That singlar hanimal said Mr Snaffle pointing to the old horse
is the celebrated Hemperor that was the wonder of Hastleys some years
back and was parted with by Mr Ducrow honly because his feelins
wouldnt allow him to keep him no longer after the death of the first
Mrs D who invariably rode him I bought him thinking that praps
ladies and Cockney bucks might like to ride him for his haction is
wonderful and he canters like a harmchair but hes not safe on any
day except Sundays

And whys that asked Captain Walker Why is he safer on Sundays than
other days

BECAUSE THERES NO MUSIC in the streets on Sundays The first gent that
rode him found himself dancing a quadrille in Hupper Brook Street to
an urdygurdy that was playing Cherry Ripe such is the natur of the
hanimal And if you reklect the play of the Battle of Hoysterlitz in
which Mrs D hacted the female hussar you may remember how she
and the horse died in the third act to the toon of God preserve the
Emperor from which this horse took his name Only play that toon to
him and he rears hisself up beats the hair in time with his forelegs
and then sinks gently to the ground as though he were carried off by a
cannonball He served a lady hopposite Hapsley Ouse so one day and
since then Ive never let him out to a friend except on Sunday when in
course theres no danger Heglantine IS a friend of mine and of course
I wouldnt put the poor fellow on a hanimal I couldnt trust

After a little more conversation my lord and his friend quitted Mr
Snaffles and as they walked away towards the Regent his Lordship
might be heard shrieking with laughter crying Capital by jingo
exthlent Dwive down in the dwag Take Lungly Worth a thousand pound
by Jove and similar ejaculations indicative of exceeding delight

On Saturday morning at ten oclock to a moment Mr Woolsey called at
Mr Eglantines with a yellow handkerchief under his arm It contained
the best and handsomest bodycoat that ever gentleman put on It fitted
Eglantine to a nicetyit did not pinch him in the least and yet it was
of so exquisite a cut that the perfumer found as he gazed delighted
in the glass that he looked like a manly portly highbred gentlemana
lieutenantcolonel in the army at the very least

Youre a full man Eglantine said the tailor delighted too with
his own work but that cant be helped You look more like Hercules
than Falstaff now sir and if a coat can make a gentleman a gentleman
you are Let me recommend you to sink the blue cravat and take the
stripes off your trousers Dress quiet sir draw it mild Plain
waistcoat dark trousers black neckcloth black hat and if theres a
betterdressed man in Europe tomorrow Im a Dutchman

Thank you Woolseythank you my dear sir said the charmed perfumer
And now Ill just trouble you to try on this here

The wig had been made with equal skill it was not in the florid style
which Mr Eglantine loved in his own person but as the perfumer said
a simple straightforward head of hair It seems as if it had grown
there all your life Mr Woolsey nobody would tell that it was not
your natral colour Mr Woolsey blushedit makes you look ten year
younger and as for that scarecrow yonder youll never I think want
to wear that again

Woolsey looked in the glass and was delighted too The two rivals shook
hands and straightway became friends and in the overflowing of his
heart the perfumer mentioned to the tailor the party which he had
arranged for the next day and offered him a seat in the carriage and
at the dinner at the Star and Garter Would you like to ride said
Eglantine with rather a consequential air Snaffle will mount you and
we can go one on each side of the ladies if you like

But Woolsey humbly said he was not a riding man and gladly consented to
take a place in the clarence carriage provided he was allowed to bear
half the expenses of the entertainment This proposal was agreed to by
Mr Eglantine and the two gentlemen parted to meet once more at the
Kidneys that night when everybody was edified by the friendly tone
adopted between them

Mr Snaffle at the club meeting made the very same proposal to Mr
Woolsey that the perfumer had made and stated that as Eglantine was
going to ride Hemperor Woolsey at least ought to mount too But he
was met by the same modest refusal on the tailors part who stated that
he had never mounted a horse yet and preferred greatly the use of a
coach

Eglantines character as a swell rose greatly with the club that
evening

Two oclock on Sunday came the two beaux arrived punctually at the door
to receive the two smiling ladies

Bless us Mr Eglantine said Miss Crump quite struck by him I
never saw you look so handsome in your life He could have flung his
arms around her neck at the compliment And law Ma what has happened
to Mr Woolsey doesnt he look ten years younger than yesterday Mamma
assented and Woolsey bowed gallantly and the two gentlemen exchanged a
nod of hearty friendship

The day was delightful Eglantine pranced along magnificently on his
cantering armchair with his hat on one ear his left hand on his side
and his head flung over his shoulder and throwing underglances at
Morgiana whenever the Emperor was in advance of the clarence The
Emperor pricked up his ears a little uneasily passing the Ebenezer
chapel in Richmond where the congregation were singing a hymn but
beyond this no accident occurred nor was Mr Eglantine in the least
stiff or fatigued by the time the party reached Richmond where he
arrived time enough to give his steed into the charge of an ostler and
to present his elbow to the ladies as they alighted from the clarence
carriage

What this jovial party ate for dinner at the Star and Garter need
not here be set down If they did not drink champagne I am very much
mistaken They were as merry as any four people in Christendom and
between the bewildering attentions of the perfumer and the manly
courtesy of the tailor Morgiana very likely forgot the gallant Captain
or at least was very happy in his absence

At eight oclock they began to drive homewards WONT you come into the
carriage said Morgiana to Eglantine with one of her tenderest looks
Dick can ride the horse But Archibald was too great a lover of
equestrian exercise Im afraid to trust anybody on this horse said
he with a knowing look and so he pranced away by the side of the little
carriage The moon was brilliant and with the aid of the gaslamps
illuminated the whole face of the country in a way inexpressibly lovely

Presently in the distance the sweet and plaintive notes of a bugle
were heard and the performer with great delicacy executed a religious
air Music too heavenly said Morgiana throwing up her eyes to the
stars The music came nearer and nearer and the delight of the company
was only more intense The fly was going at about four miles an hour
and the Emperor began cantering to time at the same rapid pace

This must be some gallantry of yours Mr Woolsey said the romantic
Morgiana turning upon that gentleman Mr Eglantine treated us to the
dinner and you have provided us with the music

Now Woolsey had been a little a very little dissatisfied during the
course of the evenings entertainment by fancying that Eglantine a
much more voluble person than himself had obtained rather an undue
share of the ladies favour and as he himself paid half of the
expenses he felt very much vexed to think that the perfumer should take
all the credit of the business to himself So when Miss Crump asked if
he had provided the music he foolishly made an evasive reply to her
query and rather wished her to imagine that he HAD performed that
piece of gallantry If it pleases YOU Miss Morgiana said this artful
Schneider what more need any man ask wouldnt I have all Drury Lane
orchestra to please you

The bugle had by this time arrived quite close to the clarence carriage
and if Morgiana had looked round she might have seen whence the music
came Behind her came slowly a drag or private stagecoach with
four horses Two grooms with cockades and folded arms were behind
and driving on the box a little gentleman with a blue birdseye
neckcloth and a white coat A bugleman was by his side who performed
the melodies which so delighted Miss Crump He played very gently and
sweetly and God save the King trembled so softly out of the brazen
orifice of his bugle that the Crumps the tailor and Eglantine
himself who was riding close by the carriage were quite charmed and
subdued

Thank you DEAR Mr Woolsey said the grateful Morgiana which made
Eglantine stare and Woolsey was just saying Really upon my word
Ive nothing to do with it when the man on the dragbox said to the
bugleman Now

The bugleman began the tune of

 Heaven preserve our Emperor Fraancis
 Rum tumtitumtitittyti

At the sound the Emperor reared himself with a roar from Mr
Eglantinereared and beat the air with his forepaws Eglantine flung
his arms round the beasts neck still he kept beating time with
his forepaws Mrs Crump screamed Mr Woolsey Dick the clarence
coachman Lord Vauxhall for it was he and his Lordships two grooms
burst into a shout of laughter Morgiana cries Mercy mercy Eglantine
yells StopWoOh and a thousand ejaculations of hideous
terror until at last down drops the Emperor stone dead in the
middle of the road as if carried off by a cannonball

Fancy the situation ye callous souls who laugh at the misery of
humanity fancy the situation of poor Eglantine under the Emperor He
had fallen very easy the animal lay perfectly quiet and the perfumer
was to all intents and purposes as dead as the animal He had not
fainted but he was immovable with terror he lay in a puddle and
thought it was his own blood gushing from him and he would have lain
there until Monday morning if my Lords grooms descending had not
dragged him by the coatcollar from under the beast who still lay
quiet

Play Charming Judy Callaghan will ye says Mr Snaffles man
the flydriver on which the bugler performed that lively air and up
started the horse and the grooms who were rubbing Mr Eglantine down
against a lamppost invited him to remount

But his heart was too broken for that The ladies gladly made room for
him in the clarence Dick mounted Emperor and rode homewards The
drag too drove away playing Oh dear what can the matter be and
with a scowl of furious hate Mr Eglantine sat and regarded his rival
His pantaloons were split and his coat torn up the back

Are you hurt much dear Mr Archibald said Morgiana with unaffected
compassion

Nnot much said the poor fellow ready to burst into tears

Oh Mr Woolsey added the goodnatured girl how could you play such
a trick

Upon my word Woolsey began intending to plead innocence but the
ludicrousness of the situation was once more too much for him and he
burst out into a roar of laughter

You you cowardly beast howled out Eglantine now driven to
furyYOU laugh at me you miserable cretur Take THAT sir and he
fell upon him with all his might and wellnigh throttled the tailor
and pummelling his eyes his nose his ears with inconceivable
rapidity wrenched finally his wig off his head and flung it into the
road

Morgiana saw that Woolsey had red hair 2



CHAPTER IV IN WHICH THE HEROINE HAS A NUMBER MORE LOVERS AND CUTS A
VERY DASHING FIGURE IN THE WORLD

Two years have elapsed since the festival at Richmond which begun so
peaceably ended in such general uproar Morgiana never could be brought
to pardon Woolseys red hair nor to help laughing at Eglantines
disasters nor could the two gentlemen be reconciled to one another
Woolsey indeed sent a challenge to the perfumer to meet him with
pistols which the latter declined saying justly that tradesmen had
no business with such weapons on this the tailor proposed to meet
him with coats off and have it out like men in the presence of their
friends of the Kidney Club The perfumer said he would be party to no
such vulgar transaction on which Woolsey exasperated made an oath
that he would tweak the perfumers nose so surely as he ever entered the
clubroom and thus ONE member of the Kidneys was compelled to vacate
his armchair

Woolsey himself attended every meeting regularly but he did not evince
that gaiety and goodhumour which render mens company agreeable in
clubs On arriving he would order the boy to tell him when that
scoundrel Eglantine came and hanging up his hat on a peg would scowl
round the room and tuck up his sleeves very high and stretch and
shake his fingers and wrists as if getting them ready for that pull
of the nose which he intended to bestow upon his rival So prepared he
would sit down and smoke his pipe quite silently glaring at all and
jumping up and hitching up his coatsleeves when anyone entered the
room

The Kidneys did not like this behaviour Clinker ceased to come
Bustard the poulterer ceased to come As for Snaffle he also
disappeared for Woolsey wished to make him answerable for the
misbehaviour of Eglantine and proposed to him the duel which the latter
had declined So Snaffle went Presently they all went except the
tailor and Tressle who lived down the street and these two would
sit and pug their tobacco one on each side of Crump the landlord as
silent as Indian chiefs in a wigwam There grew to be more and more room
for poor old Crump in his chair and in his clothes the Kidneys were
gone and why should he remain One Saturday he did not come down to
preside at the club as he still fondly called it and the Saturday
following Tressle had made a coffin for him and Woolsey with the
undertaker by his side followed to the grave the father of the
Kidneys

Mrs Crump was now alone in the world How alone says some innocent
and respected reader Ah my dear sir do you know so little of human
nature as not to be aware that one week after the Richmond affair
Morgiana married Captain Walker That did she privately of course and
after the ceremony came tripping back to her parents as young people
do in plays and said Forgive me dear Pa and Ma Im married and
here is my husband the Captain Papa and mamma did forgive her as why
shouldnt they and papa paid over her fortune to her which she carried
home delighted to the Captain This happened several months before the
demise of old Crump and Mrs Captain Walker was on the Continent with
her Howard when that melancholy event took place hence Mrs Crumps
loneliness and unprotected condition Morgiana had not latterly seen
much of the old people how could she moving in her exalted sphere
receive at her genteel new residence in the Edgware Road the old
publican and his wife

Being then alone in the world Mrs Crump could not abear she said
to live in the house where she had been so respected and happy so she
sold the goodwill of the Bootjack and with the money arising from
this sale and her own private fortune being able to muster some sixty
pounds per annum retired to the neighbourhood of her dear old Sadlers
Wells where she boarded with one of Mrs Serles forty pupils Her
heart was broken she said but nevertheless about nine months after
Mr Crumps death the wallflowers nasturtiums polyanthuses and
convolvuluses began to blossom under her bonnet as usual in a year she
was dressed quite as fine as ever and now never missed The Wells or
some other place of entertainment one single night but was as regular
as the boxkeeper Nay she was a buxom widow still and an old flame of
hers Fisk so celebrated as pantaloon in Grimaldis time but now doing
the heavy fathers at The Wells proposed to her to exchange her name
for his

But this proposal the worthy widow declined altogether To say truth
she was exceedingly proud of her daughter Mrs Captain Walker They
did not see each other much at first but every now and then Mrs Crump
would pay a visit to the folks in Connaught Square and on the days when
the Captains lady called in the City Road there was not a single
official at The Wells from the first tragedian down to the callboy
who was not made aware of the fact

It has been said that Morgiana carried home her fortune in her own
reticule and smiling placed the money in her husbands lap and hence
the reader may imagine who knows Mr Walker to be an extremely selfish
fellow that a great scene of anger must have taken place and many
coarse oaths and epithets of abuse must have come from him when he
found that five hundred pounds was all that his wife had although he
had expected five thousand with her But to say the truth Walker was
at this time almost in love with his handsome rosy goodhumoured simple
wife They had made a fortnights tour during which they had been
exceedingly happy and there was something so frank and touching in the
way in which the kind creature flung her all into his lap saluting
him with a hearty embrace at the same time and wishing that it were a
thousand billion billion times more so that her darling Howard might
enjoy it that the man would have been a ruffian indeed could he have
found it in his heart to be angry with her and so he kissed her in
return and patted her on the shining ringlets and then counted over
the notes with rather a disconsolate air and ended by locking them up
in his portfolio In fact SHE had never deceived him Eglantine
had and he in return had outtricked Eglantine and so warm were his
affections for Morgiana at this time that upon my word and honour I
dont think he repented of his bargain Besides five hundred pounds in
crisp banknotes was a sum of money such as the Captain was not in the
habit of handling every day a dashing sanguine fellow he fancied there
was no end to it and already thought of a dozen ways by which it should
increase and multiply into a plum Woe is me Has not many a simple soul
examined five new hundredpound notes in this way and calculated their
powers of duration and multiplication

This subject however is too painful to be dwelt on Let us hear what
Walker did with his money Why he furnished the house in the Edgware
Road before mentioned he ordered a handsome service of plate he
sported a phaeton and two ponies he kept a couple of smart maids and
a groom footboyin fact he mounted just such a neat unpretending
gentlemanlike establishment as becomes a respectable young couple on
their outset in life Ive sown my wild oats he would say to his
acquaintances a few years since perhaps I would have longed to cut
a dash but now prudence is the word and Ive settled every farthing of
Mrs Walkers fifteen thousand on herself And the best proof that the
world had confidence in him is the fact that for the articles of plate
equipage and furniture which have been mentioned as being in his
possession he did not pay one single shilling and so prudent was he
that but for turnpikes postagestamps and kings taxes he hardly had
occasion to change a fivepound note of his wifes fortune

To tell the truth Mr Walker had determined to make his fortune And
what is easier in London Is not the sharemarket open to all Do
not Spanish and Columbian bonds rise and fall For what are companies
invented but to place thousands in the pockets of shareholders and
directors Into these commercial pursuits the gallant Captain now
plunged with great energy and made some brilliant hits at first
starting and bought and sold so opportunely that his name began to
rise in the City as a capitalist and might be seen in the printed list
of directors of many excellent and philanthropic schemes of which there
is never any lack in London Business to the amount of thousands was
done at his agency shares of vast value were bought and sold under his
management How poor Mr Eglantine used to hate him and envy him as
from the door of his emporium the firm was Eglantine and Mossrose now
he saw the Captain daily arrive in his ponyphaeton and heard of the
start he had taken in life

The only regret Mrs Walker had was that she did not enjoy enough of her
husbands society His business called him away all day his business
too obliged him to leave her of evenings very frequently alone whilst
he always in pursuit of business was dining with his great friends at
the club and drinking claret and champagne to the same end

She was a perfectly goodnatured and simple soul never made him a
single reproach but when he could pass an evening at home with her
she was delighted and when he could drive with her in the Park she was
happy for a week after On these occasions and in the fulness of her
heart she would drive to her mother and tell her story Howard drove
with me in the Park yesterday Mamma and Howard has promised to
take me to the Opera and so forth And that evening the manager Mr
Gawler the first tragedian Mrs Serle and her forty pupils all the
boxkeepers bonnetwomennay the gingerbeer girls themselves at The
Wells knew that Captain and Mrs Walker were at Kensington Gardens
or were to have the Marchioness of Billingsgates box at the Opera One
nightO joy of joysMrs Captain Walker appeared in a private box
at The Wells Thats she with the black ringlets and Cashmere shawl
smellingbottle and blackvelvet gown and bird of paradise in her hat
Goodness gracious how they all acted at her Gawler and all and how
happy Mrs Crump was She kissed her daughter between all the acts she
nodded to all her friends on the stage in the slips or in the
real water she introduced her daughter Mrs Captain Walker to the
boxopener and Melvil Delamere the first comic Canterfield the
tyrant and Jonesini the celebrated Fontarabian Statuesque were all
on the steps and shouted for Mrs Captain Walkers carriage and waved
their hats and bowed as the little ponyphaeton drove away Walker in
his moustaches had come in at the end of the play and was not a little
gratified by the compliments paid to himself and lady

Among the other articles of luxury with which the Captain furnished
his house we must not omit to mention an extremely grand piano which
occupied fourfifths of Mrs Walkers little back drawingroom and at
which she was in the habit of practising continually All day and all
night during Walkers absences and these occurred all night and all
day you might hearthe whole street might hearthe voice of the lady
at No 23 gurgling and shaking and quavering as ladies do when they
practise The street did not approve of the continuance of the noise
but neighbours are difficult to please and what would Morgiana have had
to do if she had ceased to sing It would be hard to lock a blackbird in
a cage and prevent him from singing too And so Walkers blackbird in
the snug little cage in the Edgware Road sang and was not unhappy

After the pair had been married for about a year the omnibus that
passes both by Mrs Crumps house near The Wells and by Mrs Walkers
street off the Edgware Road brought up the formernamed lady almost
every day to her daughter She came when the Captain had gone to his
business she stayed to a twooclock dinner with Morgiana she drove
with her in the ponycarriage round the Park but she never stopped
later than six Had she not to go to the play at seven And besides
the Captain might come home with some of his great friends and he
always swore and grumbled much if he found his motherinlaw on the
premises As for Morgiana she was one of those women who encourage
despotism in husbands What the husband says must be right because he
says it what he orders must be obeyed tremblingly Mrs Walker gave up
her entire reason to her lord Why was it Before marriage she had been
an independent little person she had far more brains than her Howard
I think it must have been his moustaches that frightened her and caused
in her this humility

Selfish husbands have this advantage in maintaining with easyminded
wives a rigid and inflexible behaviour viz that if they DO by any
chance grant a little favour the ladies receive it with such transports
of gratitude as they would never think of showing to a lord and master
who was accustomed to give them everything they asked for and hence
when Captain Walker signified his assent to his wifes prayer that she
should take a singingmaster she thought his generosity almost divine
and fell upon her mammas neck when that lady came the next day and
said what a dear adorable angel her Howard was and what ought she not
to do for a man who had taken her from her humble situation and raised
her to be what she was What she was poor soul She was the wife of a
swindling parvenu gentleman She received visits from six ladies of her
husbands acquaintancestwo attorneys ladies his billbrokers lady
and one or two more of whose characters we had best if you please
say nothing and she thought it an honour to be so distinguished as
if Walker had been a Lord Exeter to marry a humble maiden or a noble
prince to fall in love with a humble Cinderella or a majestic Jove
to come down from heaven and woo a Semele Look through the world
respectable reader and among your honourable acquaintances and say if
this sort of faith in women is not very frequent They WILL believe in
their husbands whatever the latter do Let John be dull ugly vulgar
and a humbug his Mary Ann never finds it out let him tell his stories
ever so many times there is she always ready with her kind smile let
him be stingy she says he is prudent let him quarrel with his best
friend she says he is always in the right let him be prodigal she
says he is generous and that his health requires enjoyment let him
be idle he must have relaxation and she will pinch herself and
her household that he may have a guinea for his club Yes and every
morning as she wakes and looks at the face snoring on the pillow by
her sideevery morning I say she blesses that dull ugly countenance
and the dull ugly soul reposing there and thinks both are something
divine I want to know how it is that women do not find out their
husbands to be humbugs Nature has so provided it and thanks to her
When last year they were acting the Midsummer Nights Dream and all
the boxes began to roar with great coarse heehaws at Titania hugging
Bottoms long long earsto me considering these things it seemed that
there were a hundred other male brutes squatted round about and treated
just as reasonably as Bottom was Their Titanias lulled them to sleep
in their laps summoned a hundred smiling delicate household fairies to
tickle their gross intellects and minister to their vulgar pleasures
and as the above remarks are only supposed to apply to honest women
loving their own lawful spouses a mercy it is that no wicked Puck is
in the way to open their eyes and point out their folly Cui bono let
them live on in their deceit I know two lovely ladies who will read
this and will say it is just very likely and not see in the least
that it has been written regarding THEM

Another point of sentiment and one curious to speculate on Have
you not remarked the immense works of art that women get through The
worstedwork sofas the counterpanes patched or knitted but these are
among the oldfashioned in the country the bushels of pincushions
the albums they laboriously fill the tremendous pieces of music they
practise the thousand other fiddlefaddles which occupy the attention
of the dear soulsnay have we not seen them seated of evenings in a
squad or company Louisa employed at the worstedwork before mentioned
Eliza at the pincushions Amelia at cardracks or filagree matches and
in the midst Theodosia with one of the candles reading out a novel
aloud Ah my dear sir mortal creatures must be very hard put to it for
amusement be sure of that when they are forced to gather together in
a company and hear novels read aloud They only do it because they cant
help it depend upon it it is a sad life a poor pastime Mr Dickens
in his American book tells of the prisoners at the silent prison
how they had ornamented their rooms some of them with a frightful
prettiness and elaboration Womens fancywork is of this
sort oftenonly prison work done because there was no other
exercisingground for their poor little thoughts and fingers and hence
these wonderful pincushions are executed these counterpanes woven
these sonatas learned By everything sentimental when I see two kind
innocent freshcheeked young women go to a piano and sit down opposite
to it upon two chairs piled with more or less musicbooks according to
their convenience and so seated go through a set of doublebarrelled
variations upon this or that tune by Herz or KalkbrennerI say far
from receiving any satisfaction at the noise made by the performance
my too susceptible heart is given up entirely to bleeding for the
performers What hours and weeks nay preparatory years of study has
that infernal jig cost them What sums has papa paid what scoldings has
mamma administered Lady Bullblock does not play herself Sir Thomas
says but she has naturally the finest ear for music ever known
what evidences of slavery in a word are there It is the condition
of the young ladys existence She breakfasts at eight she does
Mangnalls Questions with the governess till ten she practises till
one she walks in the square with bars round her till two then she
practises again then she sews or hems or reads French or Humes
History then she comes down to play to papa because he likes music
whilst he is asleep after dinner and then it is bedtime and the
morrow is another day with what are called the same duties to be gone
through A friend of mine went to call at a noblemans house the other
day and one of the young ladies of the house came into the room with a
tray on her head this tray was to give Lady Maria a graceful carriage
Mon Dieu and who knows but at that moment Lady Bell was at work with
a pair of her dumb namesakes and Lady Sophy lying flat on a
stretchingboard I could write whole articles on this theme but peace
we are keeping Mrs Walker waiting all the while

Well then if the above disquisitions have anything to do with the
story as no doubt they have I wish it to be understood that during
her husbands absence and her own solitary confinement Mrs Howard
Walker bestowed a prodigious quantity of her time and energy on the
cultivation of her musical talent and having as before stated a very
fine loud voice speedily attained no ordinary skill in the use of it
She first had for teacher little Podmore the fat chorusmaster at The
Wells and who had taught her mother the Tinkatink song which has
been such a favourite since it first appeared He grounded her well and
bade her eschew the singing of all those Eagle Tavern ballads in which
her heart formerly delighted and when he had brought her to a certain
point of skill the honest little chorusmaster said she should have a
still better instructor and wrote a note to Captain Walker enclosing
his own little account speaking in terms of the most flattering
encomium of his ladys progress and recommending that she should take
lessons of the celebrated Baroski Captain Walker dismissed Podmore
then and engaged Signor Baroski at a vast expense as he did not fail
to tell his wife In fact he owed Baroski no less than two hundred and
twenty guineas when he wasBut we are advancing matters

Little Baroski is the author of the opera of Eliogabalo of the
oratorio of Purgatorio which made such an immense sensation of songs
and balletmusics innumerable He is a German by birth and shows such
an outrageous partiality for pork and sausages and attends at church so
constantly that I am sure there cannot be any foundation in the story
that he is a member of the ancient religion He is a fat little man
with a hooked nose and jetty whiskers and coalblack shining eyes and
plenty of rings and jewels on his fingers and about his person and a
very considerable portion of his shirtsleeves turned over his coat to
take the air His great hands which can sprawl over half a piano and
produce those effects on the instrument for which he is celebrated are
encased in lemoncoloured kids new or cleaned daily Parenthetically
let us ask why so many men with coarse red wrists and big hands
persist in the white kid glove and wristband system Baroskis gloves
alone must cost him a little fortune only he says with a leer when
asked the question Get along vid you dont you know dere is a
gloveress that lets me have dem very sheap He rides in the Park has
splendid lodgings in Dover Street and is a member of the Regent Club
where he is a great source of amusement to the members to whom he tells
astonishing stories of his successes with the ladies and for whom he
has always play and opera tickets in store His eye glistens and his
little heart beats when a lord speaks to him and he has been known to
spend large sums of money in giving treats to young sprigs of fashion at
Richmond and elsewhere In my bolyticks he says I am consarevatiff
to de bagbone In fine he is a puppy and withal a man of
considerable genius in his profession

This gentleman then undertook to complete the musical education
of Mrs Walker He expressed himself at once enshanted vid her
gababilities found that the extent of her voice was brodigious and
guaranteed that she should become a firstrate singer The pupil was
apt the master was exceedingly skilful and accordingly Mrs Walkers
progress was very remarkable although for her part honest Mrs Crump
who used to attend her daughters lessons would grumble not a little at
the new system and the endless exercises which she Morgiana was made
to go through It was very different in HER time she said Incledon
knew no music and who could sing so well now Give her a good English
ballad it was a thousand times sweeter than your Figaros and
Semiramides

In spite of these objections however and with amazing perseverance and
cheerfulness Mrs Walker pursued the method of study pointed out to her
by her master As soon as her husband went to the City in the morning
her operations began if he remained away at dinner her labours still
continued nor is it necessary for me to particularise her course of
study nor indeed possible for between ourselves none of the
male FitzBoodles ever could sing a note and the jargon of scales and
solfeggios is quite unknown to me But as no man can have seen persons
addicted to music without remarking the prodigious energies they display
in the pursuit as there is no father of daughters however ignorant
but is aware of the pianorattling and voiceexercising which go on in
his house from morning till night so let all fancy without further
inquiry how the heroine of our story was at this stage of her existence
occupied

Walker was delighted with her progress and did everything but pay
Baroski her instructor We know why he didnt pay It was his nature
not to pay bills except on extreme compulsion but why did not Baroski
employ that extreme compulsion Because if he had received his money
he would have lost his pupil and because he loved his pupil more than
money Rather than lose her he would have given her a guinea as well
as her cachet He would sometimes disappoint a great personage but he
never missed his attendance on HER and the truth must out that he was
in love with her as Woolsey and Eglantine had been before

By the immortel Chofe he would say dat letell ding sents me mad vid
her big ice But only vait avile in six veeks I can bring any voman
in England on her knees to me and you shall see vat I vill do vid my
Morgiana He attended her for six weeks punctually and yet Morgiana
was never brought down on her knees he exhausted his best stock of
gomblimends and she never seemed disposed to receive them with
anything but laughter And as a matter of course he only grew more
infatuated with the lovely creature who was so provokingly goodhumoured
and so laughingly cruel

Benjamin Baroski was one of the chief ornaments of the musical
profession in London he charged a guinea for a lesson of threequarters
of an hour abroad and he had furthermore a school at his own
residence where pupils assembled in considerable numbers and of that
curious mixed kind which those may see who frequent these places of
instruction There were very innocent young ladies with their mammas
who would hurry them off trembling to the farther corner of the room
when certain doubtful professional characters made their appearance
There was Miss Grigg who sang at the Foundling and Mr Johnson
who sang at the Eagle Tavern and Madame Fioravanti a very doubtful
character who sang nowhere but was always coming out at the Italian
Opera There was Lumley Limpiter Lord Tweedledales son one of the
most accomplished tenors in town and who we have heard sings with
the professionals at a hundred concerts and with him too was Captain
Guzzard of the Guards with his tremendous bass voice which all the
world declared to be as fine as Portos and who shared the applause of
Baroskis school with Mr Bulger the dentist of Sackville Street who
neglected his ivory and gold plates for his voice as every unfortunate
individual will do who is bitten by the music mania Then among
the ladies there were a halfscore of dubious pale governesses and
professionals with turned frocks and lank damp bandeaux of hair under
shabby little bonnets luckless creatures these who were parting with
their poor little store of halfguineas to be enabled to say they were
pupils of Signor Baroski and so get pupils of their own among the
British youths or employment in the choruses of the theatres

The prima donna of the little company was Amelia Larkins Baroskis own
articled pupil on whose future reputation the eminent master staked his
own whose profits he was to share and whom he had farmed to this end
from her father a most respectable sheriffs officers assistant and
now by his daughters exertions a considerable capitalist Amelia is
blonde and blueeyed her complexion is as bright as snow her ringlets
of the colour of straw her figurebut why describe her figure Has not
all the world seen her at the Theatres Royal and in America under the
name of Miss Ligonier

Until Mrs Walker arrived Miss Larkins was the undisputed princess of
the Baroski companythe Semiramide the Rosina the Tamina the Donna
Anna Baroski vaunted her everywhere as the great rising genius of the
day bade Catalani look to her laurels and questioned whether Miss
Stephens could sing a ballad like his pupil Mrs Howard Walker arrived
and created on the first occasion no small sensation She improved
and the little society became speedily divided into Walkerites and
Larkinsians and between these two ladies as indeed between Guzzard and
Bulger before mentioned between Miss Brunck and Miss Horsman the two
contraltos and between the chorussingers after their kind a great
rivalry arose Larkins was certainly the better singer but could
her strawcoloured curls and dumpy highshouldered figure bear any
comparison with the jetty ringlets and stately form of Morgiana Did not
Mrs Walker too come to the musiclesson in her carriage and with a
black velvet gown and Cashmere shawl while poor Larkins meekly stepped
from Bell Yard Temple Bar in an old print gown and clogs which she
left in the hall Larkins sing said Mrs Crump sarcastically Im
sure she ought her mouths big enough to sing a duet Poor Larkins had
no one to make epigrams in her behoof her mother was at home tending
the younger ones her father abroad following the duties of his
profession she had but one protector as she thought and that one
was Baroski Mrs Crump did not fail to tell Lumley Limpiter of her own
former triumphs and to sing him Tinkatink which we have previously
heard and to state how in former days she had been called the
Ravenswing And Lumley on this hint made a poem in which he compared
Morgianas hair to the plumage of the Ravens wing and Larkinissas to
that of the canary by which two names the ladies began soon to be known
in the school

Ere long the flight of the Ravenswing became evidently stronger whereas
that of the canary was seen evidently to droop When Morgiana sang all
the room would cry Bravo when Amelia performed scarce a hand
was raised for applause of her except Morgianas own and that the
Larkinses thought was lifted in odious triumph rather than in sympathy
for Miss L was of an envious turn and little understood the generosity
of her rival

At last one day the crowning victory of the Ravenswing came In the
trio of Baroskis own opera of Eliogabalo Rosy lips and rosy wine
Miss Larkins who was evidently unwell was taking the part of the
English captive which she had sung in public concerts before royal
dukes and with considerable applause and from some reason performed
it so ill that Baroski slapping down the music on the piano in a fury
cried Mrs Howard Walker as Miss Larkins cannot sing today will
you favour us by taking the part of Boadicetta Mrs Walker got up
smilingly to obeythe triumph was too great to be withstood and as
she advanced to the piano Miss Larkins looked wildly at her and stood
silent for a while and at last shrieked out BENJAMIN in a tone of
extreme agony and dropped fainting down on the ground Benjamin looked
extremely red it must be confessed at being thus called by what
we shall denominate his Christian name and Limpiter looked round at
Guzzard and Miss Brunck nudged Miss Horsman and the lesson concluded
rather abruptly that day for Miss Larkins was carried off to the next
room laid on a couch and sprinkled with water

Goodnatured Morgiana insisted that her mother should take Miss Larkins
to Bell Yard in her carriage and went herself home on foot but I dont
know that this piece of kindness prevented Larkins from hating her I
should doubt if it did

Hearing so much of his wifes skill as a singer the astute Captain
Walker determined to take advantage of it for the purpose of increasing
his connection He had Lumley Limpiter at his house before long which
was indeed no great matter for honest Lum would go anywhere for a
good dinnerand an opportunity to show off his voice afterwards
and Lumley was begged to bring any more clerks in the Treasury of his
acquaintance Captain Guzzard was invited and any officers of the
Guards whom he might choose to bring Bulger received occasional
cardsin a word and after a short time Mrs Howard Walkers
musical parties began to be considerably suivies Her husband had the
satisfaction to see his rooms filled by many great personages and once
or twice in return indeed whenever she was wanted or when people
could not afford to hire the first singers she was asked to parties
elsewhere and treated with that killing civility which our English
aristocracy knows how to bestow on artists Clever and wise aristocracy
It is sweet to mark your ways and study your commerce with inferior
men

I was just going to commence a tirade regarding the aristocracy
here and to rage against that cool assumption of superiority which
distinguishes their lordships commerce with artists of all sorts that
politeness which if it condescends to receive artists at all takes
care to have them altogether so that there can be no mistake about
their rankthat august patronage of art which rewards it with a silly
flourish of knighthood to be sure but takes care to exclude it from
any contact with its betters in societyI was I say just going to
commence a tirade against the aristocracy for excluding artists from
their company and to be extremely satirical upon them for instance
for not receiving my friend Morgiana when it suddenly came into my head
to ask was Mrs Walker fit to move in the best societyto which query
it must humbly be replied that she was not Her education was not such
as to make her quite the equal of Baker Street She was a kind honest
and clever creature but it must be confessed not refined Wherever
she went she had if not the finest at any rate the most showy gown
in the room her ornaments were the biggest her hats toques berets
marabouts and other fallals always the most conspicuous She drops
hs here and there I have seen her eat peas with a knife and Walker
scowling on the opposite side of the table striving in vain to catch
her eye and I shall never forget Lady Smigsmags horror when she
asked for porter at dinner at Richmond and began to drink it out of the
pewter pot It was a fine sight She lifted up the tankard with one of
the finest arms covered with the biggest bracelets ever seen and had
a bird of paradise on her head that curled round the pewter disc of the
pot as she raised it like a halo These peculiarities she had and has
still She is best away from the genteel world that is the fact When
she says that The weather is so ot that it is quite debiliating when
she laughs when she hits her neighbour at dinner on the side of the
waistcoat as she will if he should say anything that amuses her she
does what is perfectly natural and unaffected on her part but what
is not customarily done among polite persons who can sneer at her
odd manners and her vanity but dont know the kindness honesty and
simplicity which distinguish her This point being admitted it follows
of course that the tirade against the aristocracy would in the present
instance be out of placeso it shall be reserved for some other
occasion

The Ravenswing was a person admirably disposed by nature to be happy
She had a disposition so kindly that any small attention would satisfy
it was pleased when alone was delighted in a crowd was charmed with
a joke however old was always ready to laugh to sing to dance or to
be merry was so tenderhearted that the smallest ballad would make her
cry and hence was supposed by many persons to be extremely affected
and by almost all to be a downright coquette Several competitors for
her favour presented themselves besides Baroski Young dandies used to
canter round her phaeton in the park and might be seen haunting her
doors in the mornings The fashionable artist of the day made a drawing
of her which was engraved and sold in the shops a copy of it was
printed in a song Blackeyed Maiden of Araby the words by Desmond
Mulligan Esquire the music composed and dedicated to MRS HOWARD
WALKER by her most faithful and obliged servant Benjamin Baroski and
at night her Operabox was full Her Operabox Yes the heiress of the
Bootjack actually had an Operabox and some of the most fashionable
manhood of London attended it

Now in fact was the time of her greatest prosperity and her husband
gathering these fashionable characters about him extended his agency
considerably and began to thank his stars that he had married a woman
who was as good as a fortune to him

In extending his agency however Mr Walker increased his expenses
proportionably and multiplied his debts accordingly More furniture and
more plate more wines and more dinnerparties became necessary the
little ponyphaeton was exchanged for a brougham of evenings and we may
fancy our old friend Mr Eglantines rage and disgust as he looked from
the pit of the Opera to see Mrs Walker surrounded by what he called
the swell young nobs about London bowing to my Lord and laughing
with his Grace and led to carriage by Sir John

The Ravenswings position at this period was rather an exceptional
one She was an honest woman visited by that peculiar class of our
aristocracy who chiefly associate with ladies who are NOT honest She
laughed with all but she encouraged none Old Crump was constantly at
her side now when she appeared in public the most watchful of mammas
always awake at the Opera though she seemed to be always asleep but no
dandy debauchee could deceive her vigilance and for this reason Walker
who disliked her as every man naturally will must and should dislike
his motherinlaw was contented to suffer her in his house to act as a
chaperon to Morgiana

None of the young dandies ever got admission of mornings to the little
mansion in the Edgware Road the blinds were always down and though you
might hear Morgianas voice half across the Park as she was practising
yet the youthful hallporter in the sugarloaf buttons was instructed to
deny her and always declared that his mistress was gone out with the
most admirable assurance

After some two years of her life of splendour there were to be sure a
good number of morning visitors who came with SINGLE knocks and asked
for Captain Walker but these were no more admitted than the dandies
aforesaid and were referred generally to the Captains office
whither they went or not at their convenience The only man who obtained
admission into the house was Baroski whose cab transported him thrice
a week to the neighbourhood of Connaught Square and who obtained ready
entrance in his professional capacity

But even then and much to the wicked little musicmasters
disappointment the dragon Crump was always at the piano with her
endless worsted work or else reading her unfailing Sunday Times and
Baroski could only employ de langvitch of de ice as he called it
with his fair pupil who used to mimic his manner of rolling his eyes
about afterwards and perform Baroski in love for the amusement of her
husband and her mamma The former had his reasons for overlooking the
attentions of the little musicmaster and as for the latter had she
not been on the stage and had not many hundreds of persons in jest or
earnest made love to her What else can a pretty woman expect who is
much before the public And so the worthy mother counselled her daughter
to bear these attentions with good humour rather than to make them a
subject of perpetual alarm and quarrel

Baroski then was allowed to go on being in love and was never in the
least disturbed in his passion and if he was not successful at least
the little wretch could have the pleasure of HINTING that he was and
looking particularly roguish when the Ravenswing was named and assuring
his friends at the club that upon his vort dere vas no trut IN DAT
REBORT

At last one day it happened that Mrs Crump did not arrive in time for
her daughters lesson perhaps it rained and the omnibus was fulla
smaller circumstance than that has changed a whole life ere nowMrs
Crump did not arrive and Baroski did and Morgiana seeing no great
harm sat down to her lesson as usual and in the midst of it down
went the musicmaster on his knees and made a declaration in the most
eloquent terms he could muster

Dont be a fool Baroski said the ladyI cant help it if her
language was not more choice and if she did not rise with cold dignity
exclaiming Unhand me sirDont be a fool said Mrs Walker
but get up and lets finish the lesson

You hardhearted adorable little greature vill you not listen to me

No I vill not listen to you Benjamin concluded the lady Get up
and take a chair and dont go on in that ridiklous way dont

But Baroski having a speech by heart determined to deliver himself
of it in that posture and begged Morgiana not to turn avay her divine
hice and to listen to de voice of his despair and so forth he seized
the ladys hand and was going to press it to his lips when she said
with more spirit perhaps than grace

Leave go my hand sir Ill box your ears if you dont

But Baroski wouldnt release her hand and was proceeding to imprint
a kiss upon it and Mrs Crump who had taken the omnibus at a
quarterpast twelve instead of that at twelve had just opened the
drawingroom door and was walking in when Morgiana turning as red as
a peony and unable to disengage her left hand which the musician held
raised up her right hand and with all her might and main gave her
lover such a tremendous slap in the face as caused him abruptly to
release the hand which he held and would have laid him prostrate on
the carpet but for Mrs Crump who rushed forward and prevented him from
falling by administering right and left a whole shower of slaps such as
he had never endured since the day he was at school

What imperence said that worthy lady youll lay hands on my
daughter will you one two Youll insult a woman in distress will
you you little coward one two Take that and mind your manners
you filthy monster

Baroski bounced up in a fury By Chofe you shall hear of dis shouted
he you shall pay me dis

As many more as you please little Benjamin cried the widow
Augustus to the page was that the Captains knock At this
Baroski made for his hat Augustus show this imperence to the door
and if he tries to come in again call a policeman do you hear

The musicmaster vanished very rapidly and the two ladies instead of
being frightened or falling into hysterics as their betters would have
done laughed at the odious monsters discomfiture as they called him
Such a man as that set himself up against my Howard said Morgiana
with becoming pride but it was agreed between them that Howard should
know nothing of what had occurred for fear of quarrels or lest he
should be annoyed So when he came home not a word was said and only
that his wife met him with more warmth than usual you could not have
guessed that anything extraordinary had occurred It is not my fault
that my heroines sensibilities were not more keen that she had not the
least occasion for salvolatile or symptom of a fainting fit but so it
was and Mr Howard Walker knew nothing of the quarrel between his wife
and her instructor until

Until he was arrested next day at the suit of Benjamin Baroski for two
hundred and twenty guineas and in default of payment was conducted by
Mr Tobias Larkins to his principals lockup house in Chancery Lane



CHAPTER V IN WHICH MR WALKER FALLS INTO DIFFICULTIES AND MRS WALKER
MAKES MANY FOOLISH ATTEMPTS TO RESCUE HIM

I hope the beloved reader is not silly enough to imagine that Mr
Walker on finding himself inspunged for debt in Chancery Lane was
so foolish as to think of applying to any of his friends those great
personages who have appeared every now and then in the course of this
little history and have served to give it a fashionable air No no
he knew the world too well and that though Billingsgate would give him
as many dozen of claret as he could carry away under his belt as the
phrase is I cant help it madam if the phrase is not more genteel
and though Vauxhall would lend him his carriage slap him on the back
and dine at his housetheir lordships would have seen Mr Walker
depending from a beam in front of the Old Bailey rather than have helped
him to a hundred pounds

And why forsooth should we expect otherwise in the world I observe
that men who complain of its selfishness are quite as selfish as the
world is and no more liberal of money than their neighbours and I am
quite sure with regard to Captain Walker that he would have treated a
friend in want exactly as he when in want was treated There was only
his lady who was in the least afflicted by his captivity and as for the
club that went on we are bound to say exactly as it did on the day
previous to his disappearance

By the way about clubscould we not but for fear of detaining the
fair reader too long enter into a wholesome dissertation here on the
manner of friendship established in those institutions and the noble
feeling of selfishness which they are likely to encourage in the male
race I put out of the question the stale topics of complaint such as
leaving home encouraging gormandising and luxurious habits etc but
look also at the dealings of clubmen with one another Look at the rush
for the evening paper See how Shiverton orders a fire in the dogdays
and Swettenham opens the windows in February See how Cramley takes
the whole breast of the turkey on his plate and how many times Jenkins
sends away his beggarly halfpint of sherry Clubbery is organised
egotism Club intimacy is carefully and wonderfully removed from
friendship You meet Smith for twenty years exchange the days news
with him laugh with him over the last joke grow as well acquainted as
two men may be togetherand one day at the end of the list of members
of the club you read in a little paragraph by itself with all the
honours

 MEMBER DECEASED
 Smith John Esq

or he on the other hand has the advantage of reading your own name
selected for a similar typographical distinction There it is that
abominable little exclusive list at the end of every clubcatalogueyou
cant avoid it I belong to eight clubs myself and know that one year
FitzBoodle George Savage Esq unless it should please fate to remove
my brother and his six sons when of course it would be FitzBoodle Sir
George Savage Bart will appear in the dismal category There is that
list down I must go in itthe day will come and I shant be seen in
the bowwindow someone else will be sitting in the vacant armchair
the rubber will begin as usual and yet somehow Fitz will not be there
Wheres Fitz says Trumpington just arrived from the Rhine Dont
you know says Punter turning down his thumb to the carpet You led
the club I think says Ruff to his partner the OTHER partner and
the waiter snuffs the candles

 

I hope in the course of the above little pause every single member of
a club who reads this has profited by the perusal He may belong I
say to eight clubs he will die and not be missed by any of the five
thousand members Peace be to him the waiters will forget him and his
name will pass away and another greatcoat will hang on the hook whence
his own used to be dependent

And this I need not say is the beauty of the clubinstitutions If it
were otherwiseif forsooth we were to be sorry when our friends died
or to draw out our purses when our friends were in want we should be
insolvent and life would be miserable Be it ours to button up our
pockets and our hearts and to make merryit is enough to swim down
this lifestream for ourselves if Poverty is clutching hold of our
heels or Friendship would catch an arm kick them both off Every man
for himself is the word and plenty to do too

My friend Captain Walker had practised the above maxims so long and
resolutely as to be quite aware when he came himself to be in distress
that not a single soul in the whole universe would help him and he took
his measures accordingly

When carried to Mr Bendigos lockup house he summoned that gentleman
in a very haughty way took a blank bankers cheque out of his
pocketbook and filling it up for the exact sum of the writ orders Mr
Bendigo forthwith to open the door and let him go forth

Mr Bendigo smiling with exceeding archness and putting a finger
covered all over with diamond rings to his extremely aquiline nose
inquired of Mr Walker whether he saw anything green about his face
intimating by this gay and goodhumoured interrogatory his suspicion
of the unsatisfactory nature of the document handed over to him by Mr
Walker

Hang it sir says Mr Walker go and get the cheque cashed and be
quick about it Send your man in a cab and heres a halfcrown to pay
for it The confident air somewhat staggers the bailiff who asked him
whether he would like any refreshment while his man was absent getting
the amount of the cheque and treated his prisoner with great civility
during the time of the messengers journey

But as Captain Walker had but a balance of two pounds five and twopence
this sum was afterwards divided among his creditors the law expenses
being previously deducted from it the bankers of course declined to
cash the Captains draft for two hundred and odd pounds simply writing
the words No effects on the paper on receiving which reply Walker
far from being cast down burst out laughing very gaily produced a real
fivepound note and called upon his host for a bottle of champagne
which the two worthies drank in perfect friendship and goodhumour The
bottle was scarcely finished and the young Israelitish gentleman who
acts as waiter in Cursitor Street had only time to remove the flask and
the glasses when poor Morgiana with a flood of tears rushed into her
husbands arms and flung herself on his neck and calling him her
dearest blessed Howard would have fainted at his feet but that he
breaking out in a fury of oaths asked her how after getting him into
that scrape through her infernal extravagance she dared to show her
face before him This address speedily frightened the poor thing out
of her fainting fitthere is nothing so good for female hysterics as a
little conjugal sternness nay brutality as many husbands can aver who
are in the habit of employing the remedy

My extravagance Howard said she in a faint way and quite put off
her purpose of swooning by the sudden attack made upon herSurely my
love you have nothing to complain of

To complain of maam roared the excellent Walker Is two hundred
guineas to a musicmaster nothing to complain of Did you bring me such
a fortune as to authorise your taking guinea lessons Havent I raised
you out of your sphere of life and introduced you to the best of the
land Havent I dressed you like a duchess Havent I been for you such
a husband as very few women in the world ever had madamanswer me
that

Indeed Howard you were always very kind sobbed the lady

Havent I toiled and slaved for youbeen out all day working for you
Havent I allowed your vulgar old mother to come to your houseto my
house I say Havent I done all this

She could not deny it and Walker who was in a rage and when a man is
in a rage for what on earth is a wife made but that he should vent his
rage on her continued for some time in this strain and so abused
frightened and overcame poor Morgiana that she left her husband fully
convinced that she was the most guilty of beings and bemoaning his
double bad fortune that her Howard was ruined and she the cause of his
misfortunes

When she was gone Mr Walker resumed his equanimity for he was not
one of those men whom a few months of the Kings Bench were likely to
terrify and drank several glasses of punch in company with his host
with whom in perfect calmness he talked over his affairs That he
intended to pay his debt and quit the spunginghouse next day is a
matter of course no one ever was yet put in a spunginghouse that did
not pledge his veracity he intended to quit it tomorrow Mr Bendigo
said he should be heartily glad to open the door to him and in the
meantime sent out diligently to see among his friends if there were
any more detainers against the Captain and to inform the Captains
creditors to come forward against him

Morgiana went home in profound grief it may be imagined and could
hardly refrain from bursting into tears when the sugarloaf page asked
whether master was coming home early or whether he had taken his key
she lay awake tossing and wretched the whole night and very early in
the morning rose up and dressed and went out

Before nine oclock she was in Cursitor Street and once more joyfully
bounced into her husbands arms who woke up yawning and swearing
somewhat with a severe headache occasioned by the jollification of the
previous night for strange though it may seem there are perhaps no
places in Europe where jollity is more practised than in prisons for
debt and I declare for my own part I mean of course that I went
to visit a friend I have dined at Mr Aminadabs as sumptuously as at
Longs

But it is necessary to account for Morgianas joyfulness which was
strange in her husbands perplexity and after her sorrow of the
previous night Well then when Mrs Walker went out in the morning
she did so with a very large basket under her arm Shall I carry the
basket maam said the page seizing it with much alacrity

No thank you cried his mistress with equal eagerness its only

Of course maam replied the boy sneering I knew it was that

Glass continued Mrs Walker turning extremely red Have
the goodness to call a coach sir and not to speak till you are
questioned

The young gentleman disappeared upon his errand the coach was called
and came Mrs Walker slipped into it with her basket and the page went
downstairs to his companions in the kitchen and said Its acomin
masters in quod and missus has gone out to pawn the plate When the
cook went out that day she somehow had by mistake placed in her basket
a dozen of tableknives and a plated eggstand When the ladysmaid
took a walk in the course of the afternoon she found she had occasion
for eight cambric pockethandkerchiefs marked with her mistresss
cipher halfadozen pair of shoes gloves long and short some silk
stockings and a goldheaded scentbottle Both the new cashmeres is
gone said she and theres nothing left in Mrs Walkers trinketbox
but a paper of pins and an old coral bracelet As for the page he
rushed incontinently to his masters dressingroom and examined every
one of the pockets of his clothes made a parcel of some of them and
opened all the drawers which Walker had not locked before his departure
He only found threehalfpence and a bill stamp and about fortyfive
tradesmens accounts neatly labelled and tied up with red tape
These three worthies a groom who was a great admirer of Trimmer the
ladysmaid and a policeman a friend of the cooks sat down to a
comfortable dinner at the usual hour and it was agreed among them all
that Walkers ruin was certain The cook made the policeman a present of
a china punchbowl which Mrs Walker had given her and the ladysmaid
gave her friend the Book of Beauty for last year and the third volume
of Byrons poems from the drawingroom table

Im dashd if she aint taken the little French clock too said the
page and so indeed Mrs Walker had it slipped in the basket where
it lay enveloped in one of her shawls and then struck madly and
unnaturally a great number of times as Morgiana was lifting her store
of treasures out of the hackneycoach The coachman wagged his head
sadly as he saw her walking as quick as she could under her heavy load
and disappearing round the corner of the street at which Mr Ballss
celebrated jewellery establishment is situated It is a grand shop with
magnificent silver cups and salvers rare goldheaded canes flutes
watches diamond brooches and a few fine specimens of the old masters
in the window and under the words

 BALLS JEWELLER

you read

 Money Lent

in the very smallest type on the door

The interview with Mr Balls need not be described but it must have
been a satisfactory one for at the end of half an hour Morgiana
returned and bounded into the coach with sparkling eyes and told the
driver to GALLOP to Cursitor Street which smiling he promised to do
and accordingly set off in that direction at the rate of four miles an
hour I thought so said the philosophic charioteer When a mans
in quod a woman dont mind her silver spoons and he was so delighted
with her action that he forgot to grumble when she came to settle
accounts with him even though she gave him only double his fare

Take me to him said she to the young Hebrew who opened the door

To whom says the sarcastic youth theres twenty HIMS here Youre
precious early

To Captain Walker young man replied Morgiana haughtily whereupon
the youth opening the second door and seeing Mr Bendigo in a flowered
dressinggown descending the stairs exclaimed Papa heres a lady for
the Captain Im come to free him said she trembling and holding
out a bundle of banknotes Heres the amount of your claim sirtwo
hundred and twenty guineas as you told me last night The Jew took the
notes and grinned as he looked at her and grinned double as he looked
at his son and begged Mrs Walker to step into his study and take a
receipt When the door of that apartment closed upon the lady and his
father Mr Bendigo the younger fell back in an agony of laughter which
it is impossible to describe in words and presently ran out into a
court where some of the luckless inmates of the house were already
taking the air and communicated something to them which made those
individuals also laugh as uproariously as he had previously done

Well after joyfully taking the receipt from Mr Bendigo how her cheeks
flushed and her heart fluttered as she dried it on the blottingbook
and after turning very pale again on hearing that the Captain had had a
very bad night And well he might poor dear said she at which Mr
Bendigo having no person to grin at grinned at a marble bust of
Mr Pitt which ornamented his sideboardMorgiana I say these
preliminaries being concluded was conducted to her husbands apartment
and once more flinging her arms round her dearest Howards neck told
him with one of the sweetest smiles in the world to make haste and
get up and come home for breakfast was waiting and the carriage at the
door

What do you mean love said the Captain starting up and looking
exceedingly surprised

I mean that my dearest is free that the odious little creature is
paidat least the horrid bailiff is

Have you been to Baroski said Walker turning very red

Howard said his wife quite indignant

Diddid your mother give you the money asked the Captain

No I had it by me replies Mrs Walker with a very knowing look

Walker was more surprised than ever Have you any more by you said
he

Mrs Walker showed him her purse with two guineas That is all love
she said And I wish continued she you would give me a draft to pay
a whole list of little bills that have somehow all come in within the
last few days

Well well you shall have the cheque continued Mr Walker and began
forthwith to make his toilet which completed he rang for Mr Bendigo
and his bill and intimated his wish to go home directly

The honoured bailiff brought the bill but with regard to his being
free said it was impossible

How impossible said Mrs Walker turning very red and then very
pale Did I not pay just now

So you did and youve got the reshipt but theres another detainer
against the Captain for a hundred and fifty Eglantine and Mossrose of
Bond Streetperfumery for five years you know

You dont mean to say you were such a fool as to pay without asking if
there were any more detainers roared Walker to his wife

Yes she was though chuckled Mr Bendigo but shell know better the
next time and besides Captain whats a hundred and fifty pounds to
you

Though Walker desired nothing so much in the world at that moment as
the liberty to knock down his wife his sense of prudence overcame his
desire for justice if that feeling may be called prudence on his part
which consisted in a strong wish to cheat the bailiff into the idea that
he Walker was an exceedingly respectable and wealthy man Many worthy
persons indulge in this fond notion that they are imposing upon the
world strive to fancy for instance that their bankers consider
them men of property because they keep a tolerable balance pay little
tradesmens bills with ostentatious punctuality and so forthbut the
world let us be pretty sure is as wise as need be and guesses our
real condition with a marvellous instinct or learns it with curious
skill The London tradesman is one of the keenest judges of human nature
extant and if a tradesman how much more a bailiff In reply to the
ironic question Whats a hundred and fifty pounds to you Walker
collecting himself answers It is an infamous imposition and I owe
the money no more than you do but nevertheless I shall instruct
my lawyers to pay it in the course of the morning under protest of
course

Oh of course said Mr Bendigo bowing and quitting the room and
leaving Mrs Walker to the pleasure of a teteatete with her husband

And now being alone with the partner of his bosom the worthy gentleman
began an address to her which cannot be put down on paper here because
the world is exceedingly squeamish and does not care to hear the whole
truth about rascals and because the fact is that almost every other
word of the Captains speech was a curse such as would shock the
beloved reader were it put in print

Fancy then in lieu of the conversation a scoundrel disappointed and
in a fury wreaking his brutal revenge upon an amiable woman who sits
trembling and pale and wondering at this sudden exhibition of wrath
Fancy how he clenches his fists and stands over her and stamps and
screams out curses with a livid face growing wilder and wilder in his
rage wrenching her hand when she wants to turn away and only stopping
at last when she has fallen off the chair in a fainting fit with
a heartbreaking sob that made the Jewboy who was listening at the
keyhole turn quite pale and walk away Well it is best perhaps that
such a conversation should not be told at lengthat the end of
it when Mr Walker had his wife lifeless on the floor he seized a
waterjug and poured it over her which operation pretty soon brought
her to herself and shaking her black ringlets she looked up once more
again timidly into his face and took his hand and began to cry

He spoke now in a somewhat softer voice and let her keep paddling on
with his hand as before he COULDNT speak very fiercely to the poor
girl in her attitude of defeat and tenderness and supplication
Morgiana said he your extravagance and carelessness have brought me
to ruin Im afraid If you had chosen to have gone to Baroski a word
from you would have made him withdraw the writ and my property wouldnt
have been sacrificed as it has now been for nothing It maynt be yet
too late however to retrieve ourselves This bill of Eglantines is
a regular conspiracy I am sure between Mossrose and Bendigo here you
must go to Eglantinehes an oldan old flame of yours you know

She dropped his hand I cant go to Eglantine after what has passed
between us she said but Walkers face instantly began to wear a
certain look and she said with a shudder Well well dear I WILL
go You will go to Eglantine and ask him to take a bill for the
amount of this shameful demandat any date never mind what Mind
however to see him alone and Im sure if you choose you can settle the
business Make haste set off directly and come back as there may be
more detainers in

Trembling and in a great flutter Morgiana put on her bonnet and
gloves and went towards the door Its a fine morning said Mr
Walker looking out a walk will do you good andMorgianadidnt you
say you had a couple of guineas in your pocket

Here it is said she smiling all at once and holding up her face to
be kissed She paid the two guineas for the kiss Was it not a mean act
Is it possible that people can love where they do not respect says
Miss Prim _I_ never would Nobody asked you Miss Prim but recollect
Morgiana was not born with your advantages of education and breeding
and was in fact a poor vulgar creature who loved Mr Walker not
because her mamma told her nor because he was an exceedingly eligible
and wellbroughtup young man but because she could not help it and
knew no better Nor is Mrs Walker set up as a model of virtue ah no
when I want a model of virtue I will call in Baker Street and ask for a
sitting of my dear if I may be permitted to say so Miss Prim

We have Mr Howard Walker safely housed in Mr Bendigos establishment
in Cursitor Street Chancery Lane and it looks like mockery and want of
feeling towards the excellent hero of this story or as should rather
be said towards the husband of the heroine to say what he might have
been but for the unlucky little circumstance of Baroskis passion for
Morgiana

If Baroski had not fallen in love with Morgiana he would not have given
her two hundred guineas worth of lessons he would not have so far
presumed as to seize her hand and attempt to kiss it if he had not
attempted to kiss her she would not have boxed his ears he would not
have taken out the writ against Walker Walker would have been free
very possibly rich and therefore certainly respected he always said
that a months more liberty would have set him beyond the reach of
misfortune

The assertion is very likely a correct one for Walker had a flashy
enterprising genius which ends in wealth sometimes in the Kings Bench
not seldom occasionally alas in Van Diemens Land He might have been
rich could he have kept his credit and had not his personal expenses
and extravagances pulled him down He had gallantly availed himself of
his wifes fortune nor could any man in London as he proudly said
have made five hundred pounds go so far He had as we have seen
furnished a house sideboard and cellar with it he had a carriage and
horses in his stable and with the remainder he had purchased shares
in four companiesof three of which he was founder and director had
conducted innumerable bargains in the foreign stocks had lived and
entertained sumptuously and made himself a very considerable income He
had set up THE CAPITOL Loan and Life Assurance Company had discovered
the Chimborazo gold mines and the Society for Recovering and Draining
the Pontine Marshes capital ten millions patron HIS HOLINESS THE POPE
It certainly was stated in an evening paper that His Holiness had made
him a Knight of the Spur and had offered to him the rank of Count and
he was raising a loan for His Highness the Cacique of Panama who had
sent him by way of dividend the grand cordon of His Highnesss order
of the Castle and Falcon which might be seen any day at his office in
Bond Street with the parchments signed and sealed by the Grand Master
and Falcon Kingatarms of His Highness In a week more Walker would
have raised a hundred thousand pounds on His Highnesss twenty per cent
loan he would have had fifteen thousand pounds commission for himself
his companies would have risen to par he would have realised his
shares he would have gone into Parliament he would have been made a
baronet who knows a peer probably And I appeal to you sir Walker
would say to his friends could any man have shown better proof of his
affection for his wife than by laying out her little miserable money as
I did They call me heartless sir because I didnt succeed sir my
life has been a series of sacrifices for that woman such as no man ever
performed before

A proof of Walkers dexterity and capability for business may be seen
in the fact that he had actually appeased and reconciled one of his
bitterest enemiesour honest friend Eglantine After Walkers marriage
Eglantine who had now no mercantile dealings with his former agent
became so enraged with him that as the only means of revenge in his
power he sent him in his bill for goods supplied to the amount of
one hundred and fifty guineas and sued him for the amount But Walker
stepped boldly over to his enemy and in the course of half an hour they
were friends

Eglantine promised to forego his claim and accepted in lieu of it three
hundredpound shares of the exPanama stock bearing twentyfive per
cent payable halfyearly at the house of Hocus Brothers St Swithins
Lane three hundredpound shares and the SECOND class of the order
of the Castle and Falcon with the riband and badge In four years
Eglantine my boy I hope to get you the Grand Cordon of the order
said Walker I hope to see you a KNIGHT GRAND CROSS with a grant of a
hundred thousand acres reclaimed from the Isthmus

To do my poor Eglantine justice he did not care for the hundred
thousand acresit was the star that delighted himah how his fat
chest heaved with delight as he sewed on the cross and riband to his
dresscoat and lighted up four wax candles and looked at himself in
the glass He was known to wear a greatcoat after thatit was that he
might wear the cross under it That year he went on a trip to Boulogne
He was dreadfully ill during the voyage but as the vessel entered
the port he was seen to emerge from the cabin his coat open the star
blazing on his chest the soldiers saluted him as he walked the streets
he was called Monsieur le Chevalier and when he went home he entered
into negotiations with Walker to purchase a commission in His Highnesss
service Walker said he would get him the nominal rank of Captain the
fees at the Panama War Office were fiveandtwenty pounds which
sum honest Eglantine produced and had his commission and a pack of
visiting cards printed as Captain Archibald Eglantine KCF Many a
time he looked at them as they lay in his desk and he kept the cross in
his dressingtable and wore it as he shaved every morning

His Highness the Cacique it is well known came to England and had
lodgings in Regent Street where he held a levee at which Eglantine
appeared in the Panama uniform and was most graciously received by
his Sovereign His Highness proposed to make Captain Eglantine his
aidedecamp with the rank of Colonel but the Captains exchequer
was rather low at that moment and the fees at the War Office were
peremptory Meanwhile His Highness left Regent Street was said by some
to have returned to Panama by others to be in his native city of Cork
by others to be leading a life of retirement in the New Cut Lambeth
at any rate was not visible for some time so that Captain Eglantines
advancement did not take place Eglantine was somehow ashamed to mention
his military and chivalric rank to Mr Mossrose when that gentleman
came into partnership with him and kept these facts secret until
they were detected by a very painful circumstance On the very day when
Walker was arrested at the suit of Benjamin Baroski there appeared in
the newspapers an account of the imprisonment of His Highness the Prince
of Panama for a bill owing to a licensed victualler in Ratcliff Highway
The magistrate to whom the victualler subsequently came to complain
passed many pleasantries on the occasion He asked whether His Highness
did not drink like a swan with two necks whether he had brought any
Belles savages with him from Panama and so forth and the whole court
said the report was convulsed with laughter when Boniface produced a
green and yellow riband with a large star of the order of the Castle
and Falcon with which His Highness proposed to gratify him in lieu of
paying his little bill

It was as he was reading the above document with a bleeding heart that
Mr Mossrose came in from his daily walk to the City Vell Eglantine
says he have you heard the newsh

About His Highness

About your friend Valker hes arrested for two hundred poundsh

Eglantine at this could contain no more but told his story of how he
had been induced to accept three hundred pounds of Panama stock for
his account against Walker and cursed his stars for his folly Vell
youve only to bring in another bill said the younger perfumer
swear he owes you a hundred and fifty pounds and well have a writ out
against him this afternoon

And so a second writ was taken out against Captain Walker

Youll have his wife here very likely in a day or two said Mr
Mossrose to his partner them chaps always sends their wives and I
hope you know how to deal with her

I dont value her a figs hend said Eglantine Ill treat her like
the dust of the hearth After that womans conduct to me I should like
to see her have the haudacity to come here and if she does youll see
how Ill serve her

The worthy perfumer was in fact resolved to be exceedingly
hardhearted in his behaviour towards his old love and acted over at
night in bed the scene which was to occur when the meeting should take
place Oh thought he but it will be a grand thing to see the proud
Morgiana on her knees to me and me apointing to the door and saying
Madam youve steeled this eart against you you havebury the
recollection of old times of those old times when I thought my eart
would have broke but it didntno earts are made of sterner stuff I
didnt die as I thought I should I stood it and live to see the woman
I despised at my feetha ha at my feet

In the midst of these thoughts Mr Eglantine fell asleep but it
was evident that the idea of seeing Morgiana once more agitated him
considerably else why should he have been at the pains of preparing
so much heroism His sleep was exceedingly fitful and troubled he saw
Morgiana in a hundred shapes he dreamed that he was dressing her hair
that he was riding with her to Richmond that the horse turned into a
dragon and Morgiana into Woolsey who took him by the throat and choked
him while the dragon played the keybugle And in the morning when
Mossrose was gone to his business in the City and he sat reading the
Morning Post in his study ah what a thump his heart gave as the lady
of his dreams actually stood before him

Many a lady who purchased brushes at Eglantines shop would have given
ten guineas for such a colour as his when he saw her His heart beat
violently he was almost choking in his stays he had been prepared for
the visit but his courage failed him now it had come They were both
silent for some minutes

You know what I am come for at last said Morgiana from under her
veil but she put it aside as she spoke

Ithat isyesits a painful affair mem he said giving one look
at her pale face and then turning away in a flurry I beg to refer
you to Blunt Hone and Sharpus my lawyers mem he added collecting
himself

I didnt expect this from YOU Mr Eglantine said the lady and began
to sob

And after whats appened I didnt expect a visit from YOU mem
I thought Mrs Capting Walker was too great a dame to visit poor
Harchibald Eglantine though some of the first men in the country DO
visit him Is there anything in which I can oblige you mem

O heavens cried the poor woman have I no friend left I never
thought that you too would have deserted me Mr Archibald

The Archibald pronounced in the old way had evidently an effect on
the perfumer he winced and looked at her very eagerly for a moment
What can I do for you mem at last said he

What is this bill against Mr Walker for which he is now in prison

Perfumery supplied for five years that man used more airbrushes than
any duke in the land and as for eaudeCologne he must have bathed
himself in it He hordered me about like a lord He never paid me one
shillinghe stabbed me in my most vital partbut ah ah never mind
THAT and I said I would be revenged and I AM

The perfumer was quite in a rage again by this time and wiped his fat
face with his pockethandkerchief and glared upon Mrs Walker with a
most determined air

Revenged on whom ArchibaldMr Eglantine revenged on meon a poor
woman whom you made miserable You would not have done so once

Ha and a precious way you treated me ONCE said Eglantine dont
talk to me mem of ONCE Bury the recollection of once for hever
I thought my eart would have broke once but no earts are made of
sterner stuff I didnt die as I thought I should I stood itand I
live to see the woman who despised me at my feet

Oh Archibald was all the lady could say and she fell to sobbing
again it was perhaps her best argument with the perfumer

Oh Harchibald indeed continued he beginning to swell dont call
me Harchibald Morgiana Think what a position you might have held if
youd chose when whenyou MIGHT have called me Harchibald Now
its no use added he with harrowing pathos but though Ive been
wronged I cant bear to see women in tearstell me what I can do

Dear good Mr Eglantine send to your lawyers and stop this horrid
prosecutiontake Mr Walkers acknowledgment for the debt If he is
free he is sure to have a very large sum of money in a few days and
will pay you all Do not ruin himdo not ruin me by persisting now Be
the old kind Eglantine you were

Eglantine took a hand which Morgiana did not refuse he thought about
old times He had known her since childhood almost as a girl he dandled
her on his knee at the Kidneys as a woman he had adored herhis
heart was melted

He did pay me in a sort of way reasoned the perfumer with
himselfthese bonds though they are not worth much I took em for
better or for worse and I cant bear to see her crying and to trample
on a woman in distress Morgiana he added in a loud cheerful voice
cheer up Ill give you a release for your husband I WILL be the old
kind Eglantine I was

Be the old kind jackass you vash here roared a voice that made Mr
Eglantine start Vy vat an old fat fool you are Eglantine to give up
our just debts because a voman comes snivelling and crying to youand
such a voman too exclaimed Mr Mossrose for his was the voice

Such a woman sir cried the senior partner

Yes such a womanvy didnt she jilt you herselfhasnt she been
trying the same game with Baroski and are you so green as to give up
a hundred and fifty pounds because she takes a fancy to come vimpering
here I wont I can tell you The moneys as much mine as it is yours
and Ill have it or keep Walkers body thats what I will

At the presence of his partner the timid good genius of Eglantine
which had prompted him to mercy and kindness at once outspread its
frightened wings and flew away

You see how it is Mrs W said he looking down its an affair
of businessin all these here affairs of business Mr Mossrose is the
managing man aint you Mr Mossrose

A pretty business it would be if I wasnt replied Mossrose doggedly
Come maam says he Ill tell you vat I do I take fifty per shent
not a farthing lessgive me that and out your husband goes

Oh sir Howard will pay you in a week

Vell den let him stop at my uncle Bendigos for a week and come out
denhes very comfortable there said Shylock with a grin Hadnt
you better go to the shop Mr Eglantine continued he and look after
your business Mrs Walker cant want you to listen to her all day

Eglantine was glad of the excuse and slunk out of the studio not into
the shop but into his parlour where he drank off a great glass of
maraschino and sat blushing and exceedingly agitated until Mossrose
came to tell him that Mrs W was gone and wouldnt trouble him any
more But although he drank several more glasses of maraschino and went
to the play that night and to the Cidercellars afterwards neither
the liquor nor the play nor the delightful comic songs at the cellars
could drive Mrs Walker out of his head and the memory of old times
and the image of her pale weeping face

Morgiana tottered out of the shop scarcely heeding the voice of Mr
Mossrose who said Ill take forty per shent and went back to his
duty cursing himself for a softhearted fool for giving up so much of
his rights to a puling woman Morgiana I say tottered out of the
shop and went up Conduit Street weeping weeping with all her eyes
She was quite faint for she had taken nothing that morning but the
glass of water which the pastrycook in the Strand had given her and
was forced to take hold of the railings of a house for support just as
a little gentleman with a yellow handkerchief under his arm was issuing
from the door

Good heavens Mrs Walker said the gentleman It was no other than
Mr Woolsey who was going forth to try a bodycoat for a customer Are
you illwhats the matterfor Gods sake come in and he took her
arm under his and led her into his backparlour and seated her and
had some wine and water before her in one minute before she had said
one single word regarding herself

As soon as she was somewhat recovered and with the interruption of
a thousand sobs the poor thing told as well as she could her little
story Mr Eglantine had arrested Mr Walker she had been trying to
gain time for him Eglantine had refused

The hardhearted cowardly brute to refuse HER anything said loyal Mr
Woolsey My dear says he Ive no reason to love your husband and I
know too much about him to respect him but I love and respect YOU and
will spend my last shilling to serve you At which Morgiana could only
take his hand and cry a great deal more than ever She said Mr Walker
would have a great deal of money in a week that he was the best of
husbands and she was sure Mr Woolsey would think better of him when
he knew him that Mr Eglantines bill was one hundred and fifty pounds
but that Mr Mossrose would take forty per cent if Mr Woolsey could
say how much that was

Ill pay a thousand pound to do you good said Mr Woolsey bouncing
up stay here for ten minutes my dear until my return and all shall
be right as you will see He was back in ten minutes and had called
a cab from the stand opposite all the coachmen there had seen and
commented on Mrs Walkers woebegone looks and they were off for
Cursitor Street in a moment Theyll settle the whole debt for twenty
pounds said he and showed an order to that effect from Mr Mossrose
to Mr Bendigo empowering the latter to release Walker on receiving Mr
Woolseys acknowledgment for the above sum

Theres no use paying it said Mr Walker doggedly it would only
be robbing you Mr Woolseyseven more detainers have come in while my
wife has been away I must go through the court now but he added in a
whisper to the tailor my good sir my debts of HONOUR are sacred and
if you will have the goodness to lend ME the twenty pounds I pledge you
my word as a gentleman to return it when I come out of quod

It is probable that Mr Woolsey declined this for as soon as he was
gone Walker in a tremendous fury began cursing his wife for dawdling
three hours on the road Why the deuce maam didnt you take a cab
roared he when he heard she had walked to Bond Street Those writs
have only been in half an hour and I might have been off but for you

Oh Howard said she didnt you takedidnt I give you mymy last
shilling and fell back and wept again more bitterly than ever

Well love said her amiable husband turning rather red never mind
it wasnt your fault It is but going through the court It is no great
odds I forgive you



CHAPTER VI IN WHICH MR WALKER STILL REMAINS IN DIFFICULTIES BUT SHOWS
GREAT RESIGNATION UNDER HIS MISFORTUNES

The exemplary Walker seeing that escape from his enemies was hopeless
and that it was his duty as a man to turn on them and face them now
determined to quit the splendid though narrow lodgings which Mr
Bendigo had provided for him and undergo the martyrdom of the Fleet
Accordingly in company with that gentleman he came over to Her
Majestys prison and gave himself into the custody of the officers
there and did not apply for the accommodation of the Rules by which
in those days the captivity of some debtors was considerably lightened
because he knew perfectly well that there was no person in the wide
world who would give a security for the heavy sums for which Walker was
answerable What these sums were is no matter and on this head we do
not think it at all necessary to satisfy the curiosity of the reader He
may have owed hundredsthousands his creditors only can tell he paid
the dividend which has been formerly mentioned and showed thereby his
desire to satisfy all claims upon him to the uttermost farthing

As for the little house in Connaught Square when after quitting her
husband Morgiana drove back thither the door was opened by the page
who instantly thanked her to pay his wages and in the drawingroom on
a yellow satin sofa sat a seedy man with a pot of porter beside him
placed on an album for fear of staining the rosewood table and the
seedy man signified that he had taken possession of the furniture in
execution for a judgment debt Another seedy man was in the diningroom
reading a newspaper and drinking gin he informed Mrs Walker that
he was the representative of another judgment debt and of another
executionTheres another on em in the kitchen said the page
taking an inwentory of the furniture and he swears hell have you took
up for swindling for pawning the plate

Sir said Mr Woolsey for that worthy man had conducted Morgiana
homesir said he shaking his stick at the young page if you give
any more of your impudence Ill beat every button off your jacket and
as there were some four hundred of these ornaments the page was silent
It was a great mercy for Morgiana that the honest and faithful tailor
had accompanied her The good fellow had waited very patiently for her
for an hour in the parlour or coffeeroom of the lockup house knowing
full well that she would want a protector on her way homewards and his
kindness will be more appreciated when it is stated that during
the time of his delay in the coffeeroom he had been subject to the
entreaties nay to the insults of Cornet Fipkin of the Blues who was
in prison at the suit of Linsey Woolsey and Co and who happened to be
taking his breakfast in the apartment when his obdurate creditor entered
it The Cornet a hero of eighteen who stood at least five feet three
in his boots and owed fifteen thousand pounds was so enraged at the
obduracy of his creditor that he said he would have thrown him out of
the window but for the bars which guarded it and entertained serious
thoughts of knocking the tailors head off but that the latter putting
his right leg forward and his fists in a proper attitude told the
young officer to come on on which the Cornet cursed the tailor for a
snob and went back to his breakfast

The execution people having taken charge of Mr Walkers house Mrs
Walker was driven to take refuge with her mamma near Sadlers Wells
and the Captain remained comfortably lodged in the Fleet He had some
ready money and with it managed to make his existence exceedingly
comfortable He lived with the best society of the place consisting of
several distinguished young noblemen and gentlemen He spent the morning
playing at fives and smoking cigars the evening smoking cigars and
dining comfortably Cards came after dinner and as the Captain was
an experienced player and near a score of years older than most of his
friends he was generally pretty successful indeed if he had received
all the money that was owed to him he might have come out of prison
and paid his creditors twenty shillings in the poundthat is if he had
been minded to do so But there is no use in examining into that point
too closely for the fact is young Fipkin only paid him forty pounds
out of seven hundred for which he gave him IOUs Algernon Deuceace
not only did not pay him three hundred and twenty which he lost at blind
hookey but actually borrowed seven and sixpence in money from Walker
which has never been repaid to this day and Lord Doublequits actually
lost nineteen thousand pounds to him at heads and tails which he never
paid pleading drunkenness and his minority The reader may recollect a
paragraph which went the round of the papers entitled

Affair of honour in the Fleet PrisonYesterday morning behind the
pump in the second court Lord Dblquts and Captain Hwrd Wlkr a
near relative we understand of his Grace the Duke of Nrflk had
a hostile meeting and exchanged two shots These two young sprigs of
nobility were attended to the ground by Major Flush who by the way
is FLUSH no longer and Captain Pam late of the  Dragoons Play is
said to have been the cause of the quarrel and the gallant Captain is
reported to have handled the noble lords nose rather roughly at one
stage of the transactions

When Morgiana at Sadlers Wells heard these news she was ready to
faint with terror and rushed to the Fleet Prison and embraced her lord
and master with her usual expansion and fits of tears very much to that
gentlemans annoyance who happened to be in company with Pain and Flush
at the time and did not care that his handsome wife should be seen
too much in the dubious precincts of the Fleet He had at least so much
shame about him and had always rejected her entreaties to be allowed to
inhabit the prison with him

It is enough would he say casting his eyes heavenward and with a
most lugubrious countenanceit is enough Morgiana that _I_ should
suffer even though your thoughtlessness has been the cause of my ruin
But enough of THAT I will not rebuke you for faults for which I know
you are now repentant and I never could bear to see you in the midst
of the miseries of this horrible place Remain at home with your mother
and let me drag on the weary days here alone If you can get me any more
of that pale sherry my love do I require something to cheer me in
solitude and have found my chest very much relieved by that wine Put
more pepper and eggs my dear into the next vealpie you make me I
cant eat the horrible messes in the coffeeroom here

It was Walkers wish I cant tell why except that it is the wish of
a great number of other persons in this strange world to make his
wife believe that he was wretched in mind and ill in health and all
assertions to this effect the simple creature received with numberless
tears of credulity she would go home to Mrs Crump and say how her
darling Howard was pining away how he was ruined for HER and with what
angelic sweetness he bore his captivity The fact is he bore it with so
much resignation that no other person in the world could see that he
was unhappy His life was undisturbed by duns his day was his own from
morning till night his diet was good his acquaintances jovial his
purse tolerably well supplied and he had not one single care to annoy
him

Mrs Crump and Woolsey perhaps received Morgianas account of her
husbands miseries with some incredulity The latter was now a daily
visitor to Sadlers Wells His love for Morgiana had become a warm
fatherly generous regard for her it was out of the honest fellows
cellar that the wine used to come which did so much good to Mr Walkers
chest and he tried a thousand ways to make Morgiana happy

A very happy day indeed it was when returning from her visit to the
Fleet she found in her mothers sittingroom her dear grand rosewood
piano and every one of her musicbooks which the kindhearted tailor
had purchased at the sale of Walkers effects And I am not ashamed
to say that Morgiana herself was so charmed that when as usual Mr
Woolsey came to drink tea in the evening she actually gave him a kiss
which frightened Mr Woolsey and made him blush exceedingly She
sat down and played him that evening every one of the songs which
he likedthe OLD songsnone of your Italian stuff Podmore the old
musicmaster was there too and was delighted and astonished at the
progress in singing which Morgiana had made and when the little party
separated he took Mr Woolsey by the hand and said Give me leave to
tell you sir that youre a TRUMP

That he is said Canterfield the first tragic an honour to human
nature A man whose hand is open as day to melting charity and whose
heart ever melts at the tale of womans distress

Pooh pooh stuff and nonsense sir said the tailor but upon my
word Mr Canterfields words were perfectly correct I wish as much
could be said in favour of Woolseys old rival Mr Eglantine who
attended the sale too but it was with a horrid kind of satisfaction
at the thought that Walker was ruined He bought the yellow satin
sofa before mentioned and transferred it to what he calls his
sittingroom where it is to this day bearing many marks of the best
bears grease Woolsey bid against Baroski for the piano very nearly
up to the actual value of the instrument when the artist withdrew from
competition and when he was sneering at the ruin of Mr Walker the
tailor sternly interrupted him by saying What the deuce are YOU
sneering at You did it sir and youre paid every shilling of your
claim aint you On which Baroski turned round to Miss Larkins
and said Mr Woolsey was a snop the very word though pronounced
somewhat differently which the gallant Cornet Fipkin had applied to
him

Well so he WAS a snob But vulgar as he was I declare for my part
that I have a greater respect for Mr Woolsey than for any single
nobleman or gentleman mentioned in this true history

It will be seen from the names of Messrs Canterfield and Podmore
that Morgiana was again in the midst of the widow Crumps favourite
theatrical society and this indeed was the case The widows little
room was hung round with the pictures which were mentioned at the
commencement of the story as decorating the bar of the Bootjack and
several times in a week she received her friends from The Wells and
entertained them with such humble refreshments of tea and crumpets as
her modest means permitted her to purchase Among these persons Morgiana
lived and sang quite as contentedly as she had ever done among the
demireps of her husbands society and only she did not dare to own it
to herself was a great deal happier than she had been for many a day
Mrs Captain Walker was still a great lady amongst them Even in his
ruin Walker the director of three companies and the owner of the
splendid ponychaise was to these simple persons an awful character
and when mentioned they talked with a great deal of gravity of his being
in the country and hoped Mrs Captain W had good news of him They all
knew he was in the Fleet but had he not in prison fought a duel with a
viscount Montmorency of the Norfolk Circuit was in the Fleet too
and when Canterfield went to see poor Montey the latter had pointed out
Walker to his friend who actually hit Lord George Tennison across the
shoulders in play with a racketbat which event was soon made known to
the whole greenroom

They had me up one day said Montmorency to sing a comic song and
give my recitations and we had champagne and lobstersalad SUCH nobs
added the player Billingsgate and Vauxhall were there too and left
college at eight oclock

When Morgiana was told of the circumstance by her mother she hoped her
dear Howard had enjoyed the evening and was thankful that for once he
could forget his sorrows Nor somehow was she ashamed of herself for
being happy afterwards but gave way to her natural goodhumour without
repentance or selfrebuke I believe indeed alas why are we made
acquainted with the same fact regarding ourselves long after it is past
and goneI believe these were the happiest days of Morgianas whole
life She had no cares except the pleasant one of attending on her
husband an easy smiling temperament which made her regardless of
tomorrow and add to this a delightful hope relative to a certain
interesting event which was about to occur and which I shall not
particularise further than by saying that she was cautioned against too
much singing by Mr Squills her medical attendant and that widow Crump
was busy making up a vast number of little caps and diminutive cambric
shirts such as delighted GRANDMOTHERS are in the habit of fashioning
I hope this is as genteel a way of signifying the circumstance which
was about to take place in the Walker family as Miss Prim herself could
desire Mrs Walkers mother was about to become a grandmother Theres
a phrase The Morning Post which says this story is vulgar Im sure
cannot quarrel with that I dont believe the whole Court Guide would
convey an intimation more delicately

Well Mrs Crumps little grandchild was born entirely to the
dissatisfaction I must say of his father who when the infant was
brought to him in the Fleet had him abruptly covered up in his cloak
again from which he had been removed by the jealous prison doorkeepers
why do you think Walker had a quarrel with one of them and the wretch
persisted in believing that the bundle Mrs Crump was bringing to her
soninlaw was a bundle of disguised brandy

The brutes said the lady and the fathers a brute too said she
He takes no more notice of me than if I was a kitchenmaid and of
Woolsey than if he was a leg of muttonthe dear blessed little cherub

Mrs Crump was a motherinlaw let us pardon her hatred of her
daughters husband

The Woolsey compared in the above sentence both to a leg of mutton and
a cherub was not the eminent member of the firm of Linsey Woolsey and
Co but the little baby who was christened Howard Woolsey Walker with
the full consent of the father who said the tailor was a deuced good
fellow and felt really obliged to him for the sherry for a frockcoat
which he let him have in prison and for his kindness to Morgiana The
tailor loved the little boy with all his soul he attended his mother
to her churching and the child to the font and as a present to his
little godson on his christening he sent two yards of the finest white
kerseymere in his shop to make him a cloak The Duke had had a pair of
inexpressibles off that very piece

Housefurniture is bought and sold musiclessons are given children
are born and christened ladies are confined and churchedtime in
other words passesand yet Captain Walker still remains in prison
Does it not seem strange that he should still languish there between
palisaded walls near Fleet Market and that he should not be restored to
that active and fashionable world of which he was an ornament The fact
is the Captain had been before the court for the examination of his
debts and the Commissioner with a cruelty quite shameful towards
a fallen man had qualified his ways of getting money in most severe
language and had sent him back to prison again for the space of nine
calendar months an indefinite period and until his accounts could
be made up This delay Walker bore like a philosopher and far from
repining was still the gayest fellow of the tenniscourt and the soul
of the midnight carouse

There is no use in raking up old stories and hunting through files
of dead newspapers to know what were the specific acts which made the
Commissioner so angry with Captain Walker Many a rogue has come before
the Court and passed through it since then and I would lay a wager
that Howard Walker was not a bit worse than his neighbours But as he
was not a lord and as he had no friends on coming out of prison and
had settled no money on his wife and had as it must be confessed an
exceedingly bad character it is not likely that the latter would
be forgiven him when once more free in the world For instance when
Doublequits left the Fleet he was received with open arms by his
family and had twoandthirty horses in his stables before a week
was over Pam of the Dragoons came out and instantly got a place as
government couriera place found so good of late years and no wonder
it is better pay than that of a colonel that our noblemen and gentry
eagerly press for it Frank Hurricane was sent out as registrar of
Tobago or Sago or Ticonderago in fact for a younger son of good
family it is rather advantageous to get into debt twenty or thirty
thousand pounds you are sure of a good place afterwards in the
colonies Your friends are so anxious to get rid of you that they will
move heaven and earth to serve you And so all the above companions of
misfortune with Walker were speedily made comfortable but HE had no
rich parents his old father was dead in York jail How was he to start
in the world again What friendly hand was there to fill his pocket with
gold and his cup with sparkling champagne He was in fact an object
of the greatest pityfor I know of no greater than a gentleman of his
habits without the means of gratifying them He must live well and
he has not the means Is there a more pathetic case As for a mere low
beggarsome labourless labourer or some weaver out of placedont
let us throw away our compassion upon THEM Psha theyre accustomed
to starve They CAN sleep upon boards or dine off a crust whereas
a gentleman would die in the same situation I think this was poor
Morgianas way of reasoning For Walkers cash in prison beginning
presently to run low and knowing quite well that the dear fellow could
not exist there without the luxuries to which he had been accustomed
she borrowed money from her mother until the poor old lady was a sec
She even confessed with tears to Woolsey that she was in particular
want of twenty pounds to pay a poor milliner whose debt she could not
bear to put in her husbands schedule And I need not say she carried
the money to her husband who might have been greatly benefited by
itonly he had a bad run of luck at the cards and how the deuce can a
man help THAT

Woolsey had repurchased for her one of the Cashmere shawls She left it
behind her one day at the Fleet prison and some rascal stole it there
having the grace however to send Woolsey the ticket signifying the
place where it had been pawned Who could the scoundrel have been
Woolsey swore a great oath and fancied he knew but if it was Walker
himself as Woolsey fancied and probably as was the case who made away
with the shawl being pressed thereto by necessity was it fair to call
him a scoundrel for so doing and should we not rather laud the delicacy
of his proceeding He was poor who can command the cards But he did
not wish his wife should know HOW poor he could not bear that she
should suppose him arrived at the necessity of pawning a shawl

She who had such beautiful ringlets of a sudden pleaded cold in the
head and took to wearing caps One summer evening as she and the baby
and Mrs Crump and Woolsey let us say all four babies together were
laughing and playing in Mrs Crumps drawingroomplaying the most
absurd gambols fat Mrs Crump for instance hiding behind the sofa
Woolsey chuckchucking cockadoodledooing and performing those
indescribable freaks which gentlemen with philoprogenitive organs will
execute in the company of childrenin the midst of their play the baby
gave a tug at his mothers cap off it cameher hair was cut close to
her head

Morgiana turned as red as sealingwax and trembled very much Mrs
Crump screamed My child where is your hair and Woolsey bursting
out with a most tremendous oath against Walker that would send Miss Prim
into convulsions put his handkerchief to his face and actually wept
The infernal bubbleubbleackguard said he roaring and clenching his
fists

As he had passed the Bower of Bloom a few days before he saw Mossrose
who was combing out a jetblack ringlet and held it up as if for
Woolseys examination with a peculiar grin The tailor did not
understand the joke but he saw now what had happened Morgiana had sold
her hair for five guineas she would have sold her arm had her husband
bidden her On looking in her drawers it was found she had sold almost
all her wearing apparel the childs clothes were all there however
It was because her husband talked of disposing of a gilt coral that
the child had that she had parted with the locks which had formed her
pride

Ill give you twenty guineas for that hair you infamous fat coward
roared the little tailor to Eglantine that evening Give it up or Ill
kill you

Mr Mossrose Mr Mossrose shouted the perfumer

Vell vatsh de matter vatsh de row fight avay my boys two to one
on the tailor said Mr Mossrose much enjoying the sport for Woolsey
striding through the shop without speaking to him had rushed into the
studio where he plumped upon Eglantine

Tell him about that hair sir

That hair Now keep yourself quiet Mister Timble and dont tink for
to bully ME You mean Mrs Valkers air Vy she sold it me

And the more blackguard you for buying it Will you take twenty guineas
for it

No said Mossrose

Twentyfive

Cant said Mossrose

Hang it will you take forty There

I vish Id kep it said the Hebrew gentleman with unfeigned regret
Eglantine dressed it this very night

For Countess Baldenstiern the Swedish Hambassadors lady says
Eglantine his Hebrew partner was by no means a favourite with the
ladies and only superintended the accounts of the concern Its this
very night at Devonshire Ouse with four hostrich plumes lappets and
trimmings And now Mr Woolsey Ill trouble you to apologise

Mr Woolsey did not answer but walked up to Mr Eglantine and snapped
his fingers so close under the perfumers nose that the latter started
back and seized the bellrope Mossrose burst out laughing and the
tailor walked majestically from the shop with both hands stuck between
the lappets of his coat

My dear said he to Morgiana a short time afterwards you must
not encourage that husband of yours in his extravagance and sell the
clothes off your poor back that he may feast and act the fine gentleman
in prison

It is his health poor dear soul interposed Mrs Walker his chest
Every farthing of the money goes to the doctors poor fellow

Well now listen I am a rich man it was a great fib for Woolseys
income as a junior partner of the firm was but a small one I can
very well afford to make him an allowance while he is in the Fleet and
have written to him to say so But if you ever give him a penny or sell
a trinket belonging to you upon my word and honour I will withdraw
the allowance and though it would go to my heart Ill never see you
again You wouldnt make me unhappy would you

Id go on my knees to serve you and Heaven bless you said the wife

Well then you must give me this promise And she did And now
said he your mother and Podmore and I have been talking over
matters and weve agreed that you may make a very good income for
yourself though to be sure I wish it could have been managed any
other way but needs must you know Youre the finest singer in the
universe

La said Morgiana highly delighted

_I_ never heard anything like you though Im no judge Podmore says he
is sure you will do very well and has no doubt you might get very good
engagements at concerts or on the stage and as that husband will never
do any good and you have a child to support sing you must

Oh how glad I should be to pay his debts and repay all he has done for
me cried Mrs Walker Think of his giving two hundred guineas to Mr
Baroski to have me taught Was not that kind of him Do you REALLY think
I should succeed

Theres Miss Larkins has succeeded

The little highshouldered vulgar thing says Morgiana Im sure I
ought to succeed if SHE did

She sing against Morgiana said Mrs Crump Id like to see her
indeed She aint fit to snuff a candle to her

I dare say not said the tailor though I dont understand the thing
myself but if Morgiana can make a fortune why shouldnt she

Heaven knows we want it Woolsey cried Mrs Crump And to see her on
the stage was always the wish of my heart and so it had formerly been
the wish of Morgiana and now with the hope of helping her husband and
child the wish became a duty and she fell to practising once more from
morning till night

One of the most generous of men and tailors who ever lived now promised
if further instruction should be considered necessary though that he
could hardly believe possible that he would lend Morgiana any sum
required for the payment of lessons and accordingly she once more
betook herself under Podmores advice to the singing school Baroskis
academy was after the passages between them out of the question
and she placed herself under the instruction of the excellent English
composer Sir George Thrum whose large and awful wife Lady Thrum
dragon of virtue and propriety kept watch over the master and the
pupils and was the sternest guardian of female virtue on or off any
stage

Morgiana came at a propitious moment Baroski had launched Miss Larkins
under the name of Ligonier The Ligonier was enjoying considerable
success and was singing classical music to tolerable audiences whereas
Miss Butts Sir Georges last pupil had turned out a complete failure
and the rival house was only able to make a faint opposition to the new
star with Miss MWhirter who though an old favourite had lost her
upper notes and her front teeth and the fact was drew no longer

Directly Sir George heard Mrs Walker he tapped Podmore who
accompanied her on the waistcoat and said Poddy thank you well
cut the orange boys throat with that voice It was by the familiar
title of orange boy that the great Baroski was known among his
opponents

Well crush him Podmore said Lady Thrum in her deep hollow voice
You may stop and dine And Podmore stayed to dinner and ate cold
mutton and drank Marsala with the greatest reverence for the great
English composer The very next day Lady Thrum hired a pair of horses
and paid a visit to Mrs Crump and her daughter at Sadlers Wells

All these things were kept profoundly secret from Walker who received
very magnanimously the allowance of two guineas a week which Woolsey
made him and with the aid of the few shillings his wife could bring
him managed to exist as best he might He did not dislike gin when he
could get no claret and the former liquor under the name of tape
used to be measured out pretty liberally in what was formerly Her
Majestys prison of the Fleet

Morgiana pursued her studies under Thrum and we shall hear in the next
chapter how it was she changed her name to RAVENSWING



CHAPTER VII IN WHICH MORGIANA ADVANCES TOWARDS FAME AND HONOUR AND IN
WHICH SEVERAL GREAT LITERARY CHARACTERS MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE

We must begin my dear madam said Sir George Thrum by unlearning
all that Mr Baroski of whom I do not wish to speak with the slightest
disrespect has taught you

Morgiana knew that every professor says as much and submitted to
undergo the study requisite for Sir Georges system with perfect good
grace Au fond as I was given to understand the methods of the two
artists were pretty similar but as there was rivalry between them and
continual desertion of scholars from one school to another it was
fair for each to take all the credit he could get in the success of
any pupil If a pupil failed for instance Thrum would say Baroski had
spoiled her irretrievably while the German would regret Dat dat yong
voman who had a good organ should have trown away her dime wid dat old
Drum When one of these deserters succeeded Yes yes would either
professor cry I formed her she owes her fortune to me Both of them
thus in future days claimed the education of the famous Ravenswing
and even Sir George Thrum though he wished to ecraser the Ligonier
pretended that her present success was his work because once she had
been brought by her mother Mrs Larkins to sing for Sir Georges
approval

When the two professors met it was with the most delighted cordiality
on the part of both Mein lieber Herr Thrum would say with some
malice your sonata in x flat is divine Chevalier Baroski would
reply dat andante movement in w is worthy of Beethoven I gif you
my sacred honour and so forth In fact they loved each other as
gentlemen in their profession always do

The two famous professors conduct their academies on very opposite
principles Baroski writes ballet music Thrum on the contrary says
he cannot but deplore the dangerous fascinations of the dance and
writes more for Exeter Hall and Birmingham While Baroski drives a cab
in the Park with a very suspicious Mademoiselle Leocadie or Amenaide
by his side you may see Thrum walking to evening church with his lady
and hymns are sung there of his own composition He belongs to the
Athenaeum Club he goes to the Levee once a year he does
everything that a respectable man should and if by the means of this
respectability he manages to make his little trade far more profitable
than it otherwise would be are we to quarrel with him for it

Sir George in fact had every reason to be respectable He had been a
choirboy at Windsor had played to the old Kings violoncello had
been intimate with him and had received knighthood at the hand of his
revered sovereign He had a snuffbox which His Majesty gave him and
portraits of him and the young princes all over the house He had also
a foreign order no other indeed than the Elephant and Castle of
KalbsbratenPumpernickel conferred upon him by the Grand Duke when
here with the allied sovereigns in 1814 With this ribbon round his
neck on gala days and in a white waistcoat the old gentleman looked
splendid as he moved along in a blue coat with the Windsor button and
neat black smallclothes and silk stockings He lived in an old tall
dingy house furnished in the reign of George III his beloved master
and not much more cheerful now than a family vault They are awfully
funereal those ornaments of the close of the last centurytall gloomy
horsehair chairs mouldy Turkey carpets with wretched druggets to guard
them little cracked stickingplaster miniatures of people in tours and
pigtails over highshouldered mantelpieces two dismal urns on each side
of a lanky sideboard and in the midst a queer twisted receptacle
for wornout knives with green handles Under the sideboard stands a
cellaret that looks as if it held half a bottle of currant wine and
a shivering platewarmer that never could get any comfort out of the
wretched old cramped grate yonder Dont you know in such houses the
grey gloom that hangs over the stairs the dullcoloured old carpet that
winds its way up the same growing thinner duller and more threadbare
as it mounts to the bedroom floors There is something awful in the
bedroom of a respectable old couple of sixtyfive Think of the old
feathers turbans bugles petticoats pomatumpots spencers white
satin shoes false fronts the old flaccid boneless stays tied up in
faded riband the dusky fans the old fortyyearsold baby linen the
letters of Sir George when he was young the doll of poor Maria who died
in 1803 Fredericks first corduroy breeches and the newspaper which
contains the account of his distinguishing himself at the siege of
Seringapatam All these lie somewhere damp and squeezed down into glum
old presses and wardrobes At that glass the wife has sat many times
these fifty years in that old morocco bed her children were born Where
are they now Fred the brave captain and Charles the saucy colleger
there hangs a drawing of him done by Mr Beechey and that sketch by
Cosway was the very likeness of Louisa before

Mr FitzBoodle for Heavens sake come down What are you doing in a
ladys bedroom

The fact is madam I had no business there in life but having had
quite enough wine with Sir George my thoughts had wandered upstairs
into the sanctuary of female excellence where your Ladyship nightly
reposes You do not sleep so well now as in old days though there is no
patter of little steps to wake you overhead

They call that room the nursery still and the little wicket still hangs
at the upper stairs it has been there for forty yearsbon Dieu Cant
you see the ghosts of little faces peering over it I wonder whether
they get up in the night as the moonlight shines into the blank vacant
old room and play there solemnly with little ghostly horses and the
spirits of dolls and tops that turn and turn but dont hum

Once more sir come down to the lower storeythat is to the Morgiana
storywith which the above sentences have no more to do than this
mornings leading article in The Times only it was at this house of
Sir George Thrums that I met Morgiana Sir George in old days had
instructed some of the female members of our family and I recollect
cutting my fingers as a child with one of those attenuated greenhandled
knives in the queer box yonder

In those days Sir George Thrum was the first great musical teacher
of London and the royal patronage brought him a great number of
fashionable pupils of whom Lady FitzBoodle was one It was a long long
time ago in fact Sir George Thrum was old enough to remember persons
who had been present at Mr Brahams first appearance and the old
gentlemans days of triumph had been those of Billington and Incledon
Catalani and Madame Storace

He was the author of several operas The Camel Driver Britons
Alarmed or the Siege of BergenopZoom etc etc and of course
of songs which had considerable success in their day but are forgotten
now and are as much faded and out of fashion as those old carpets which
we have described in the professors house and which were doubtless
very brilliant once But such is the fate of carpets of flowers of
music of men and of the most admirable novelseven this story will
not be alive for many centuries Well well why struggle against Fate

But though his heyday of fashion was gone Sir George still held his
place among the musicians of the old school conducted occasionally
at the Ancient Concerts and the Philharmonic and his glees are
still favourites after public dinners and are sung by those old
bacchanalians in chestnut wigs who attend for the purpose of amusing
the guests on such occasions of festivity The great old people at
the gloomy old concerts before mentioned always pay Sir George marked
respect and indeed from the old gentlemans peculiar behaviour to his
superiors it is impossible they should not be delighted with him so he
leads at almost every one of the concerts in the oldfashioned houses in
town

Becomingly obsequious to his superiors he is with the rest of the world
properly majestic and has obtained no small success by his admirable
and undeviating respectability Respectability has been his great card
through life ladies can trust their daughters at Sir George Thrums
academy A good musician madam says he to the mother of a new pupil
should not only have a fine ear a good voice and an indomitable
industry but above all a faultless characterfaultless that is as
far as our poor nature will permit And you will remark that those young
persons with whom your lovely daughter Miss Smith will pursue her
musical studies are all in a moral point of view as spotless as that
charming young lady How should it be otherwise I have been myself the
father of a family I have been honoured with the intimacy of the wisest
and best of kings my late sovereign George III and I can proudly show
an example of decorum to my pupils in my Sophia Mrs Smith I have the
honour of introducing to you my Lady Thrum

The old lady would rise at this and make a gigantic curtsey such a
one as had begun the minuet at Ranelagh fifty years ago and the
introduction ended Mrs Smith would retire after having seen the
portraits of the princes his late Majestys snuffbox and a piece of
music which he used to play noted by himselfMrs Smith I say would
drive back to Baker Street delighted to think that her Frederica had
secured so eligible and respectable a master I forgot to say that
during the interview between Mrs Smith and Sir George the latter would
be called out of his study by his black servant and my Lady Thrum would
take that opportunity of mentioning when he was knighted and how he
got his foreign order and deploring the sad condition of OTHER musical
professors and the dreadful immorality which sometimes arose in
consequence of their laxness Sir George was a good deal engaged to
dinners in the season and if invited to dine with a nobleman as he
might possibly be on the day when Mrs Smith requested the honour of
his company he would write back that he should have had the sincerest
happiness in waiting upon Mrs Smith in Baker Street if previously my
Lord Tweedledale had not been so kind as to engage him This letter
of course shown by Mrs Smith to her friends was received by them with
proper respect and thus in spite of age and new fashions Sir George
still reigned preeminent for a mile round Cavendish Square By the
young pupils of the academy he was called Sir Charles Grandison
and indeed fully deserved this title on account of the indomitable
respectability of his whole actions

It was under this gentleman that Morgiana made her debut in public life
I do not know what arrangements may have been made between Sir George
Thrum and his pupil regarding the profits which were to accrue to the
former from engagements procured by him for the latter but there was
no doubt an understanding between them For Sir George respectable as
he was had the reputation of being extremely clever at a bargain and
Lady Thrum herself in her great hightragedy way could purchase a pair
of soles or select a leg of mutton with the best housekeeper in London

When however Morgiana had been for some six months under his tuition
he began for some reason or other to be exceedingly hospitable and
invited his friends to numerous entertainments at one of which as I
have said I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs Walker

Although the worthy musicians dinners were not good the old knight
had some excellent wine in his cellar and his arrangement of his party
deserves to be commended

For instance he meets me and Bob FitzUrse in Pall Mall at whose
paternal house he was also a visitor My dear young gentlemen says
he will you come and dine with a poor musical composer I have some
Comet hock and what is more curious to you perhaps as men of wit
one or two of the great literary characters of London whom you would
like to seequite curiosities my dear young friends And we agreed to
go

To the literary men he says I have a little quiet party at home Lord
Roundtowers the Honourable Mr FitzUrse of the Life Guards and a few
more Can you tear yourself away from the war of wits and take a quiet
dinner with a few mere men about town

The literary men instantly purchase new satin stocks and white gloves
and are delighted to fancy themselves members of the world of fashion
Instead of inviting twelve Royal Academicians or a dozen authors or
a dozen men of science to dinner as his Grace the Duke of  and the
Right Honourable Sir Robert  are in the habit of doing once a
year this plan of fusion is the one they should adopt Not invite all
artists as they would invite all farmers to a rent dinner but they
should have a proper commingling of artists and men of the world There
is one of the latter whose name is George Savage FitzBoodle who But
let us return to Sir George Thrum

FitzUrse and I arrive at the dismal old house and are conducted up the
staircase by a black servant who shouts out Missa FissBoodlethe
HONOURABLE Missa FissUrse It was evident that Lady Thrum had
instructed the swarthy groom of the chambers for there is nothing
particularly honourable in my friend Fitzs face that I know of unless
an abominable squint may be said to be so Lady Thrum whose figure is
something like that of the shottower opposite Waterloo Bridge makes a
majestic inclination and a speech to signify her pleasure at receiving
under her roof two of the children of Sir Georges best pupils A
lady in black velvet is seated by the old fireplace with whom a stout
gentleman in an exceedingly light coat and ornamental waistcoat is
talking very busily The great star of the night whispers our host
Mrs Walker gentlementhe RAVENSWING She is talking to the famous
Mr Slang of the  Theatre

Is she a fine singer says FitzUrse Shes a very fine woman

My dear young friends you shall hear tonight I who have heard every
fine voice in Europe confidently pledge my respectability that the
Ravenswing is equal to them all She has the graces sir of a Venus
with the mind of a Muse She is a siren sir without the dangerous
qualities of one She is hallowed sir by her misfortunes as by her
genius and I am proud to think that my instructions have been the means
of developing the wondrous qualities that were latent within her until
now

You dont say so says gobemouche FitzUrse

Having thus indoctrinated Mr FitzUrse Sir George takes another of his
guests and proceeds to work upon him My dear Mr Bludyer how do you
do Mr FitzBoodle Mr Bludyer the brilliant and accomplished
wit whose sallies in the Tomahawk delight us every Saturday Nay no
blushes my dear sir you are very wicked but oh SO pleasant Well
Mr Bludyer I am glad to see you sir and hope you will have
a favourable opinion of our genius sir As I was saying to Mr
FitzBoodle she has the graces of a Venus with the mind of a Muse She
is a siren without the dangerous qualities of one etc This
little speech was made to halfadozen persons in the course of the
eveningpersons for the most part connected with the public journals
or the theatrical world There was Mr Squinny the editor of the
Flowers of Fashion Mr Desmond Mulligan the poet and reporter for
a morning paper and other worthies of their calling For though
Sir George is a respectable man and as highminded and moral an old
gentleman as ever wore kneebuckles he does not neglect the little arts
of popularity and can condescend to receive very queer company if need
be

For instance at the dinnerparty at which I had the honour of
assisting and at which on the right hand of Lady Thrum sat the oblige
nobleman whom the Thrums were a great deal too wise to omit the sight
of a lord does good to us commoners or why else should we be so anxious
to have one In the second place of honour and on her ladyships left
hand sat Mr Slang the manager of one of the theatres a gentleman
whom my Lady Thrum would scarcely but for a great necessitys sake
have been induced to invite to her table He had the honour of leading
Mrs Walker to dinner who looked splendid in black velvet and turban
full of health and smiles

Lord Roundtowers is an old gentleman who has been at the theatres five
times a week for these fifty years a living dictionary of the stage
recollecting every actor and actress who has appeared upon it for half a
century He perfectly well remembered Miss Delancy in Morgiana he knew
what had become of Ali Baba and how Cassim had left the stage and was
now the keeper of a publichouse All this store of knowledge he
kept quietly to himself or only delivered in confidence to his next
neighbour in the intervals of the banquet which he enjoys prodigiously
He lives at an hotel if not invited to dine eats a muttonchop
very humbly at his club and finishes his evening after the play at
Crockfords whither he goes not for the sake of the play but of the
supper there He is described in the Court Guide as of Simmers Hotel
and of Roundtowers county Cork It is said that the round towers really
exist But he has not been in Ireland since the rebellion and his
property is so hampered with ancestral mortgages and rentcharges and
annuities that his income is barely sufficient to provide the modest
muttonchop before alluded to He has any time these fifty years lived
in the wickedest company in London and is withal as harmless mild
goodnatured innocent an old gentleman as can readily be seen

Roundy shouts the elegant Mr Slang across the table with a voice
which makes Lady Thrum shudder Tuff a glass of wine

My Lord replies meekly Mr Slang I shall have very much pleasure
What shall it be

There is Madeira near you my Lord says my Lady pointing to a tall
thin decanter of the fashion of the year

Madeira Marsala by Jove your Ladyship means shouts Mr Slang No
no old birds are not caught with chaff Thrum old boy lets have some
of your Comet hock

My Lady Thrum I believe that IS Marsala says the knight blushing a
little in reply to a question from his Sophia Ajax the hock to Mr
Slang

Im in that yells Bludyer from the end of the table My Lord Ill
join you

Mr  I beg your pardonI shall be very happy to take wine with
you sir

It is Mr Bludyer the celebrated newspaper writer whispers Lady
Thrum

Bludyer Bludyer A very clever man I dare say He has a very loud
voice and reminds me of Brett Does your Ladyship remember Brett who
played the Fathers at the Haymarket in 1802

What an old stupid Roundtowers is says Slang archly nudging Mrs
Walker in the side Hows Walker eh

My husband is in the country replied Mrs Walker hesitatingly

Gammon _I_ know where he is Law bless youdont blush Ive been
there myself a dozen times We were talking about quod Lady Thrum Were
you ever in college

I was at the Commemoration at Oxford in 1814 when the sovereigns were
there and at Cambridge when Sir George received his degree of Doctor of
Music

Laud Laud THATS not the college WE mean

There is also the college in Gower Street where my grandson

This is the college in QUEER STREET maam haw haw Mulligan you
divvle in an Irish accent a glass of wine with you Wine here you
waiter Whats your name you black nigger Possum up a gumtree eh
Fill him up Dere he go imitating the Mandingo manner of speaking
English

In this agreeable way would Mr Slang rattle on speedily making himself
the centre of the conversation and addressing graceful familiarities to
all the gentlemen and ladies round him

It was good to see how the little knight the most moral and calm of
men was compelled to receive Mr Slangs stories and the frightened air
with which at the conclusion of one of them he would venture upon
a commendatory grin His lady on her part too had been laboriously
civil and on the occasion on which I had the honour of meeting this
gentleman and Mrs Walker it was the latter who gave the signal for
withdrawing to the lady of the house by saying I think Lady Thrum
it is quite time for us to retire Some exquisite joke of Mr Slangs
was the cause of this abrupt disappearance But as they went upstairs
to the drawingroom Lady Thrum took occasion to say My dear in
the course of your profession you will have to submit to many such
familiarities on the part of persons of low breeding such as I fear Mr
Slang is But let me caution you against giving way to your temper
as you did Did you not perceive that _I_ never allowed him to see my
inward dissatisfaction And I make it a particular point that you should
be very civil to him tonight Your interestsour interests depend upon
it

And are my interests to make me civil to a wretch like that

Mrs Walker would you wish to give lessons in morality and behaviour
to Lady Thrum said the old lady drawing herself up with great
dignity It was evident that she had a very strong desire indeed to
conciliate Mr Slang and hence I have no doubt that Sir George was to
have a considerable share of Morgianas earnings

Mr Bludyer the famous editor of the Tomahawk whose jokes Sir George
pretended to admire so much Sir George who never made a joke in his
life was a press bravo of considerable talent and no principle and
who to use his own words would back himself for a slashing article
against any man in England He would not only write but fight on a
pinch was a good scholar and as savage in his manner as with his
pen Mr Squinny is of exactly the opposite school as delicate as
milkandwater harmless in his habits fond of the flute when the state
of his chest will allow him a great practiser of waltzing and dancing
in general and in his journal mildly malicious He never goes beyond
the bounds of politeness but manages to insinuate a great deal that is
disagreeable to an author in the course of twenty lines of criticism
Personally he is quite respectable and lives with two maiden aunts at
Brompton Nobody on the contrary knows where Mr Bludyer lives He has
houses of call mysterious taverns where he may be found at particular
hours by those who need him and where panting publishers are in the
habit of hunting him up For a bottle of wine and a guinea he will write
a page of praise or abuse of any man living or on any subject or on
any line of politics Hang it sir says he pay me enough and I will
write down my own father According to the state of his credit he
is dressed either almost in rags or else in the extremest flush of the
fashion With the latter attire he puts on a haughty and aristocratic
air and would slap a duke on the shoulder If there is one thing more
dangerous than to refuse to lend him a sum of money when he asks for it
it is to lend it to him for he never pays and never pardons a man to
whom he owes Walker refused to cash a bill for me he had been heard
to say and Ill do for his wife when she comes out on the stage Mrs
Walker and Sir George Thrum were in an agony about the Tomahawk hence
the latters invitation to Mr Bludyer Sir George was in a great tremor
about the Flowers of Fashion hence his invitation to Mr Squinny Mr
Squinny was introduced to Lord Roundtowers and Mr FitzUrse as one of
the most delightful and talented of our young men of genius and Fitz
who believes everything anyone tells him was quite pleased to have
the honour of sitting near the live editor of a paper I have reason to
think that Mr Squinny himself was no less delighted I saw him giving
his card to FitzUrse at the end of the second course

No particular attention was paid to Mr Desmond Mulligan Political
enthusiasm is his forte He lives and writes in a rapture He is
of course a member of an inn of court and greatly addicted to
afterdinner speaking as a preparation for the bar where as a young man
of genius he hopes one day to shine He is almost the only man to whom
Bludyer is civil for if the latter will fight doggedly when there is
a necessity for so doing the former fights like an Irishman and has a
pleasure in it He has been on the ground I dont know how many
times and quitted his country on account of a quarrel with Government
regarding certain articles published by him in the Phoenix newspaper
With the third bottle he becomes overpoweringly great on the wrongs
of Ireland and at that period generally volunteers a couple or more of
Irish melodies selecting the most melancholy in the collection At five
in the afternoon you are sure to see him about the House of Commons
and he knows the Reform Club he calls it the Refawrum as well as if
he were a member It is curious for the contemplative mind to mark those
mysterious hangerson of Irish members of Parliamentstrange runners
and aidesdecamp which all the honourable gentlemen appear to possess
Desmond in his political capacity is one of these and besides his
calling as reporter to a newspaper is our wellinformed correspondent
of that famous Munster paper the Green Flag of Skibbereen

With Mr Mulligans qualities and history I only became subsequently
acquainted On the present evening he made but a brief stay at the
dinnertable being compelled by his professional duties to attend the
House of Commons

The above formed the party with whom I had the honour to dine What
other repasts Sir George Thrum may have given what assemblies of men
of mere science he may have invited to give their opinion regarding his
prodigy what other editors of papers he may have pacified or rendered
favourable who knows On the present occasion we did not quit the
dinnertable until Mr Slang the manager was considerably excited
by wine and music had been heard for some time in the drawingroom
overhead during our absence An addition had been made to the Thrum
party by the arrival of several persons to spend the eveninga man to
play on the violin between the singing a youth to play on the piano
Miss Horsman to sing with Mrs Walker and other scientific characters
In a corner sat a redfaced old lady of whom the mistress of the
mansion took little notice and a gentleman with a royal button who
blushed and looked exceedingly modest

Hang me says Mr Bludyer who had perfectly good reasons for
recognising Mr Woolsey and who on this day chose to assume his
aristocratic air theres a tailor in the room What do they mean by
asking ME to meet tradesmen

Delancy my dear cries Slang entering the room with a reel hows
your precious health Give us your hand When ARE we to be married Make
room for me on the sofa thats a duck

Get along Slang says Mrs Crump addressed by the manager by her
maiden name artists generally drop the title of honour which people
adopt in the world and call each other by their simple surnamesget
along Slang or Ill tell Mrs S The enterprising manager replies by
sportively striking Mrs Crump on the side a blow which causes a great
giggle from the lady insulted and a most goodhumoured threat to box
Slangs ears I fear very much that Morgianas mother thought Mr Slang
an exceedingly gentlemanlike and agreeable person besides she was
eager to have his good opinion of Mrs Walkers singing

The manager stretched himself out with much gracefulness on the sofa
supporting two little dumpy legs encased in varnished boots on a chair

Ajax some tea to Mr Slang said my Lady looking towards that
gentleman with a countenance expressive of some alarm I thought

Thats right Ajax my black prince exclaimed Slang when the negro
brought the required refreshment and now I suppose youll be wanted in
the orchestra yonder Dont Ajax play the cymbals Sir George

Ha ha ha very goodcapital answered the knight exceedingly
frightened but ours is not a MILITARY band Miss Horsman Mr Craw
my dear Mrs Ravenswing shall we begin the trio Silence gentlemen if
you please it is a little piece from my opera of the Brigands Bride
Miss Horsman takes the Pages part Mr Craw is Stiletto the Brigand my
accomplished pupil is the Bride and the music began

 THE BRIDE

 My heart with joy is beating
 My eyes with tears are dim

 THE PAGE

 Her heart with joy is beating
 Her eyes are fixed on him

 THE BRIGAND

 My heart with rage is beating
 In blood my eyeballs swim

What may have been the merits of the music or the singing I of course
cannot guess Lady Thrum sat opposite the teacups nodding her head
and beating time very gravely Lord Roundtowers by her side nodded his
head too for awhile and then fell asleep I should have done the same
but for the manager whose actions were worth of remark He sang with
all the three singers and a great deal louder than any of them he
shouted bravo or hissed as he thought proper he criticised all the
points of Mrs Walkers person Shell do Crump shell doa splendid
armyoull see her eyes in the shilling gallery What sort of a
foot has she Shes five feet three if shes an inch Bravoslap
upcapitalhurrah And he concluded by saying with the aid of the
Ravenswing he would put Ligoniers nose out of Joint

The enthusiasm of Mr Slang almost reconciled Lady Thrum to the
abruptness of his manners and even caused Sir George to forget that
his chorus had been interrupted by the obstreperous familiarity of the
manager

And what do YOU think Mr Bludyer said the tailor delighted that
his protegee should be thus winning all hearts isnt Mrs Walker a
tiptop singer eh sir

I think shes a very bad one Mr Woolsey said the illustrious
author wishing to abbreviate all communications with a tailor to whom
he owed forty pounds

Then sir says Mr Woolsey fiercely IllIll thank you to pay me
my little bill

It is true there was no connection between Mrs Walkers singing and
Woolseys little bill that the THEN sir was perfectly illogical on
Woolseys part but it was a very happy hit for the future fortunes of
Mrs Walker Who knows what would have come of her debut but for that
Then sir and whether a smashing article from the Tomahawk might
not have ruined her for ever

Are you a relation of Mrs Walkers said Mr Bludyer in reply to the
angry tailor

Whats that to you whether I am or not replied Woolsey fiercely
But Im the friend of Mrs Walker sir proud am I to say so sir and
as the poet says sir a little learnings a dangerous thing sir
and I think a man who dont pay his bills may keep his tongue quiet at
least sir and not abuse a lady sir whom everybody else praises
sir You shant humbug ME any more sir you shall hear from my attorney
tomorrow so mark that

Hush my dear Mr Woolsey cried the literary man dont make a
noise come into this window is Mrs Walker REALLY a friend of yours

Ive told you so sir

Well in that case I shall do my utmost to serve her and look you
Woolsey any article you choose to send about her to the Tomahawk I
promise you Ill put in

WILL you though then well say nothing about the little bill

You may do on that point answered Bludyer haughtily exactly as
you please I am not to be frightened from my duty mind that and mind
too that I can write a slashing article better than any man in England
I could crush her by ten lines

The tables were now turned and it was Woolseys turn to be alarmed

Pooh pooh I WAS angry said he because you abuse Mrs Walker
whos an angel on earth but Im very willing to apologise I
saycomelet me take your measure for some new clothes eh Mr B

Ill come to your shop answered the literary man quite appeased
Silence theyre beginning another song

The songs which I dont attempt to describe and upon my word and
honour as far as I can understand matters I believe to this day that
Mrs Walker was only an ordinary singerthe songs lasted a great deal
longer than I liked but I was nailed as it were to the spot having
agreed to sup at Knightsbridge barracks with FitzUrse whose carriage
was ordered at eleven oclock

My dear Mr FitzBoodle said our old host to me you can do me the
greatest service in the world

Speak sir said I

Will you ask your honourable and gallant friend the Captain to drive
home Mr Squinny to Brompton

Cant Mr Squinny get a cab

Sir George looked particularly arch Generalship my dear young
frienda little harmless generalship Mr Squinny will not give much
for MY opinion of my pupil but he will value very highly the opinion of
the Honourable Mr FitzUrse

For a moral man was not the little knight a clever fellow He had
bought Mr Squinny for a dinner worth ten shillings and for a ride in
a carriage with a lords son Squinny was carried to Brompton and set
down at his aunts door delighted with his new friends and exceedingly
sick with a cigar they had made him smoke



CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH MR WALKER SHOWS GREAT PRUDENCE AND FORBEARANCE

The describing of all these persons does not advance Morgianas story
much But perhaps some country readers are not acquainted with the
class of persons by whose printed opinions they are guided and are
simple enough to imagine that mere merit will make a reputation on the
stage or elsewhere The making of a theatrical success is a much more
complicated and curious thing than such persons fancy it to be Immense
are the pains taken to get a good word from Mr This of the Star or Mr
That of the Courier to propitiate the favour of the critic of the day
and get the editors of the metropolis into a good humourabove all to
have the name of the person to be puffed perpetually before the public
Artists cannot be advertised like Macassar oil or blacking and they
want it to the full as much hence endless ingenuity must be practised
in order to keep the popular attention awake Suppose a great actor
moves from London to Windsor the Brentford Champion must state that
Yesterday Mr Blazes and suite passed rapidly through our city the
celebrated comedian is engaged we hear at Windsor to give some of his
inimitable readings of our great national bard to the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
AUDIENCE in the realm This piece of intelligence the Hammersmith
Observer will question the next week as thusA contemporary the
Brentford Champion says that Blazes is engaged to give Shakspearian
readings at Windsor to the most illustrious audience in the realm We
question this fact very much We would indeed that it were true but
the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AUDIENCE in the realm prefer FOREIGN melodies to
THE NATIVE WOODNOTES WILD of the sweet songbird of Avon Mr Blazes
is simply gone to Eton where his son Master Massinger Blazes is
suffering we regret to hear under a severe attack of the chickenpox
This complaint incident to youth has raged we understand with
frightful virulence in Eton School

And if after the above paragraphs some London paper chooses to attack
the folly of the provincial press which talks of Mr Blazes and
chronicles his movements as if he were a crowned head what harm is
done Blazes can write in his own name to the London journal and say
that it is not HIS fault if provincial journals choose to chronicle
his movements and that he was far from wishing that the afflictions of
those who are dear to him should form the subject of public comment
and be held up to public ridicule We had no intention of hurting the
feelings of an estimable public servant writes the editor and our
remarks on the chickenpox were general not personal We sincerely
trust that Master Massinger Blazes has recovered from that complaint
and that he may pass through the measles the whoopingcough the fourth
form and all other diseases to which youth is subject with comfort to
himself and credit to his parents and teachers At his next appearance
on the stage after this controversy a British public calls for Blazes
three times after the play and somehow there is sure to be someone with
a laurelwreath in a stagebox who flings that chaplet at the inspired
artists feet

I dont know how it was but before the debut of Morgiana the English
press began to heave and throb in a convulsive manner as if indicative
of the near birth of some great thing For instance you read in one
paper

Anecdote of Karl Maria Von WeberWhen the author of Oberon was in
England he was invited by a noble duke to dinner and some of the most
celebrated of our artists were assembled to meet him The signal being
given to descend to the salleamanger the German composer was invited
by his noble host a bachelor to lead the way Is it not the fashion
in your country said he simply for the man of the first eminence to
take the first place Here is one whose genius entitles him to be first
ANYWHERE And so saying he pointed to our admirable English composer
Sir George Thrum The two musicians were friends to the last and Sir
George has still the identical piece of rosin which the author of the
Freischutz gave himThe Moon morning paper June 2

George III a composerSir George Thrum has in his possession the
score of an air the words from Samson Agonistes an autograph of the
late revered monarch We hear that that excellent composer has in store
for us not only an opera but a pupil with whose transcendent merits
the elite of our aristocracy are already familiarIbid June 5

Music with a VengeanceThe march to the sound of which the 49th and
75th regiments rushed up the breach of Badajoz was the celebrated air
from Britons Alarmed or The Siege of BergenopZoom by our famous
English composer Sir George Thrum Marshal Davoust said that the
French line never stood when that air was performed to the charge of the
bayonet We hear the veteran musician has an opera now about to
appear and have no doubt that Old England will now as then show its
superiority over ALL foreign opponentsAlbion

We have been accused of preferring the produit of the etranger to the
talent of our own native shores but those who speak so little know
us We are fanatici per la musica wherever it be and welcome merit dans
chaque pays du monde What do we say Le merite na point de pays as
Napoleon said and Sir George Thrum Chevalier de lOrdre de lElephant
et Chateau de KalbsbratenPumpernickel is a maestro whose fame
appartient a lEurope

We have just heard the lovely eleve whose rare qualities the Cavaliere
has brought to perfectionwe have heard THE RAVENSWING pourquoi
cacher un nom que demain un monde va saluer and a creature more
beautiful and gifted never bloomed before dans nos climats She sang
the delicious duet of the Nabucodonosore with Count Pizzicato with
a bellezza a grandezza a raggio that excited in the bosom of the
audience a corresponding furore her scherzando was exquisite though we
confess we thought the concluding fioritura in the passage in Y flat a
leetle a very leetle sforzata Surely the words

 Giorno dorrore
 Delire dolore
 Nabucodonosore

should be given andante and not con strepito but this is a faute bien
legere in the midst of such unrivalled excellence and only mentioned
here that we may have SOMETHING to criticise

We hear that the enterprising impresario of one of the royal theatres
has made an engagement with the Diva and if we have a regret it is
that she should be compelled to sing in the unfortunate language of our
rude northern clime which does not preter itself near so well to the
bocca of the cantatrice as do the mellifluous accents of the Lingua
Toscana the langue par excellence of song

The Ravenswings voice is a magnificent contrabasso of nine octaves
etcFlowers of Fashion June 10

Old Thrum the composer is bringing out an opera and a pupil The
opera is good the pupil firstrate The opera will do much more than
compete with the infernal twaddle and disgusting slipslop of Donizetti
and the milkandwater fools who imitate him it will and we ask the
readers of the Tomahawk were we EVER mistaken surpass all these it
is GOOD of downright English stuff The airs are fresh and pleasing
the choruses large and noble the instrumentation solid and rich the
music is carefully written We wish old Thrum and his opera well

His pupil is a SURE CARD a splendid woman and a splendid singer She
is so handsome that she might sing as much out of tune as Miss Ligonier
and the public would forgive her and sings so well that were she as
ugly as the aforesaid Ligonier the audience would listen to her The
Ravenswing that is her fantastical theatrical name her real name is
the same with that of a notorious scoundrel in the Fleet who invented
the Panama swindle the Pontine Marshes swindle the Soap swindleHOW
ARE YOU OFF FOR SOAP NOW Mr Wlkrthe Ravenswing we say will do
Slang has engaged her at thirty guineas per week and she appears next
month in Thrums opera of which the words are written by a great ass
with some talentwe mean Mr Mulligan

There is a foreign fool in the Flowers of Fashion who is doing his best
to disgust the public by his filthy flattery It is enough to make
one sick Why is the foreign beast not kicked out of the paperThe
Tomahawk June 17

The first three anecdotes were supplied by Mulligan to his paper
with many others which need not here be repeated he kept them up
with amazing energy and variety Anecdotes of Sir George Thrum met you
unexpectedly in queer corners of country papers puffs of the English
school of music appeared perpetually in Notices to Correspondents in
the Sunday prints some of which Mr Slang commanded and in others over
which the indefatigable Mulligan had a control This youth was the soul
of the little conspiracy for raising Morgiana into fame and humble as
he is and great and respectable as is Sir George Thrum it is my belief
that the Ravenswing would never have been the Ravenswing she is but for
the ingenuity and energy of the honest Hibernian reporter

It is only the business of the great man who writes the leading articles
which appear in the large type of the daily papers to compose those
astonishing pieces of eloquence the other parts of the paper are
left to the ingenuity of the subeditor whose duty it is to select
paragraphs reject or receive horrid accidents police reports
etc with which occupied as he is in the exercise of his tremendous
functions the editor himself cannot be expected to meddle The fate
of Europe is his province the rise and fall of empires and the great
questions of State demand the editors attention the humble puff
the paragraph about the last murder or the state of the crops or the
sewers in Chancery Lane is confided to the care of the sub and it
is curious to see what a prodigious number of Irishmen exist among the
subeditors of London When the Liberator enumerates the services of his
countrymen how the battle of Fontenoy was won by the Irish Brigade how
the battle of Waterloo would have been lost but for the Irish regiments
and enumerates other acts for which we are indebted to Milesian heroism
and geniushe ought at least to mention the Irish brigade of the press
and the amazing services they do to this country

The truth is the Irish reporters and soldiers appear to do their duty
right well and my friend Mr Mulligan is one of the former Having the
interests of his opera and the Ravenswing strongly at heart and being
amongst his brethren an exceedingly popular fellow he managed matters
so that never a day passed but some paragraph appeared somewhere
regarding the new singer in whom for their countrymans sake all his
brothers and subeditors felt an interest

These puffs destined to make known to all the world the merits of
the Ravenswing of course had an effect upon a gentleman very closely
connected with that lady the respectable prisoner in the Fleet Captain
Walker As long as he received his weekly two guineas from Mr Woolsey
and the occasional halfcrowns which his wife could spare in her almost
daily visits to him he had never troubled himself to inquire what her
pursuits were and had allowed her though the worthy woman longed with
all her might to betray herself to keep her secret He was far from
thinking indeed that his wife would prove such a treasure to him

But when the voice of fame and the columns of the public journals
brought him each day some new story regarding the merits genius and
beauty of the Ravenswing when rumours reached him that she was the
favourite pupil of Sir George Thrum when she brought him five guineas
after singing at the Philharmonic other five the good soul had spent
in purchasing some smart new cockades hats cloaks and laces for her
little son when finally it was said that Slang the great manager
offered her an engagement at thirty guineas per week Mr Walker became
exceedingly interested in his wifes proceedings of which he demanded
from her the fullest explanation

Using his marital authority he absolutely forbade Mrs Walkers
appearance on the public stage he wrote to Sir George Thrum a letter
expressive of his highest indignation that negotiations so important
should ever have been commenced without his authorisation and he wrote
to his dear Slang for these gentlemen were very intimate and in the
course of his transactions as an agent Mr W had had many dealings
with Mr S asking his dear Slang whether the latter thought his friend
Walker would be so green as to allow his wife to appear on the stage
and he remain in prison with all his debts on his head

And it was a curious thing now to behold how eager those very creditors
who but yesterday and with perfect correctness had denounced Mr
Walker as a swindler who had refused to come to any composition with
him and had sworn never to release him how they on a sudden became
quite eager to come to an arrangement with him and offered nay begged
and prayed him to go freeonly giving them his own and Mrs Walkers
acknowledgment of their debt with a promise that a part of the ladys
salary should be devoted to the payment of the claim

The ladys salary said Mr Walker indignantly to these gentlemen
and their attorneys Do you suppose I will allow Mrs Walker to go on
the stagedo you suppose I am such a fool as to sign bills to the full
amount of these claims against me when in a few months more I can walk
out of prison without paying a shilling Gentlemen you take Howard
Walker for an idiot I like the Fleet and rather than pay Ill stay
here for these ten years

In other words it was the Captains determination to make some
advantageous bargain for himself with his creditors and the gentlemen
who were interested in bringing forward Mrs Walker on the stage And
who can say that in so determining he did not act with laudable prudence
and justice

You do not surely consider my very dear sir that half the amount of
Mrs Walkers salaries is too much for my immense trouble and pains in
teaching her cried Sir George Thrum who in reply to Walkers note
thought it most prudent to wait personally on that gentleman Remember
that I am the first master in England that I have the best interest in
England that I can bring her out at the Palace and at every concert
and musical festival in England that I am obliged to teach her every
single note that she utters and that without me she could no more sing
a song than her little baby could walk without its nurse

I believe about half what you say said Mr Walker

My dear Captain Walker would you question my integrity Who was it
that made Mrs Millingtons fortunethe celebrated Mrs Millington
who has now got a hundred thousand pounds Who was it that brought out
the finest tenor in Europe Poppleton Ask the musical world ask
those great artists themselves and they will tell you they owe their
reputation their fortune to Sir George Thrum

It is very likely replied the Captain coolly You ARE a good
master I dare say Sir George but I am not going to article Mrs
Walker to you for three years and sign her articles in the Fleet Mrs
Walker shant sing till Im a free man thats flat if I stay here till
youre dead she shant

Gracious powers sir exclaimed Sir George do you expect me to pay
your debts

Yes old boy answered the Captain and to give me something handsome
in hand too and thats my ultimatum and so I wish you good morning
for Im engaged to play a match at tennis below

This little interview exceedingly frightened the worthy knight who
went home to his lady in a delirious state of alarm occasioned by the
audacity of Captain Walker

Mr Slangs interview with him was scarcely more satisfactory He
owed he said four thousand pounds His creditors might be brought to
compound for five shillings in the pound He would not consent to allow
his wife to make a single engagement until the creditors were satisfied
and until he had a handsome sum in hand to begin the world with Unless
my wife comes out youll be in the Gazette yourself you know you will
So you may take her or leave her as you think fit

Let her sing one night as a trial said Mr Slang

If she sings one night the creditors will want their money in full
replied the Captain I shant let her labour poor thing for the
profit of those scoundrels added the prisoner with much feeling And
Slang left him with a much greater respect for Walker than he had ever
before possessed He was struck with the gallantry of the man who could
triumph over misfortunes nay make misfortune itself an engine of good
luck

Mrs Walker was instructed instantly to have a severe sore throat The
journals in Mr Slangs interest deplored this illness pathetically
while the papers in the interest of the opposition theatre magnified it
with great malice The new singer said one the great wonder which
Slang promised us is as hoarse as a RAVEN Doctor Thorax pronounces
wrote another paper that the quinsy which has suddenly prostrated
Mrs Ravenswing whose singing at the Philharmonic previous to her
appearance at the TR excited so much applause has destroyed the
ladys voice for ever We luckily need no other prima donna when that
place as nightly thousands acknowledge is held by Miss Ligonier The
Lookeron said That although some wellinformed contemporaries had
declared Mrs W Ravenswings complaint to be a quinsy others on
whose authority they could equally rely had pronounced it to be a
consumption At all events she was in an exceedingly dangerous state
from which though we do not expect we heartily trust she may recover
Opinions differ as to the merits of this lady some saying that she was
altogether inferior to Miss Ligonier while other connoisseurs declare
the latter lady to be by no means so accomplished a person This point
we fear continued the Lookeron can never now be settled unless
which we fear is improbable Mrs Ravenswing should ever so far recover
as to be able to make her debut and even then the new singer will
not have a fair chance unless her voice and strength shall be fully
restored This information which we have from exclusive resources may
be relied on concluded the Lookeron as authentic

It was Mr Walker himself that artful and audacious Fleet prisoner who
concocted those very paragraphs against his wifes health which appeared
in the journals of the Ligonier party The partisans of that lady were
delighted the creditors of Mr Walker astounded at reading them
Even Sir George Thrum was taken in and came to the Fleet prison in
considerable alarm

Mums the word my good sir said Mr Walker Now is the time to make
arrangements with the creditors

Well these arrangements were finally made It does not matter how many
shillings in the pound satisfied the rapacious creditors of Morgianas
husband But it is certain that her voice returned to her all of a
sudden upon the Captains release The papers of the Mulligan faction
again trumpeted her perfections the agreement with Mr Slang was
concluded that with Sir George Thrum the great composer satisfactorily
arranged and the new opera underlined in immense capitals in the
bills and put in rehearsal with immense expenditure on the part of the
scenepainter and costumier

Need we tell with what triumphant success the Brigands Bride was
received All the Irish subeditors the next morning took care to have
such an account of it as made Miss Ligonier and Baroski die with envy
All the reporters who could spare time were in the boxes to support
their friends work All the journeymen tailors of the establishment of
Linsey Woolsey and Co had pit tickets given to them and applauded
with all their might All Mr Walkers friends of the Regent Club
lined the sideboxes with white kid gloves and in a little box by
themselves sat Mrs Crump and Mr Woolsey a great deal too much
agitated to applaudso agitated that Woolsey even forgot to fling down
the bouquet he had brought for the Ravenswing

But there was no lack of those horticultural ornaments The theatre
servants wheeled away a wheelbarrowfull which were flung on the stage
the next night over again and Morgiana blushing panting weeping
was led off by Mr Poppleton the eminent tenor who had crowned her
with one of the most conspicuous of the chaplets

Here she flew to her husband and flung her arms round his neck He was
flirting behind the sidescenes with Mademoiselle Flicflac who had
been dancing in the divertissement and was probably the only man in
the theatre of those who witnessed the embrace that did not care for it
Even Slang was affected and said with perfect sincerity that he wished
he had been in Walkers place The managers fortune was made at least
for the season He acknowledged so much to Walker who took a weeks
salary for his wife in advance that very night

There was as usual a grand supper in the greenroom The terrible Mr
Bludyer appeared in a new coat of the wellknown Woolsey cut and the
little tailor himself and Mrs Crump were not the least happy of the
party But when the Ravenswing took Woolseys hand and said she never
would have been there but for him Mr Walker looked very grave
and hinted to her that she must not in her position encourage the
attentions of persons in that rank of life I shall pay said he
proudly every farthing that is owing to Mr Woolsey and shall employ
him for the future But you understand my love that one cannot at
ones own table receive ones own tailor

Slang proposed Morgianas health in a tremendous speech which elicited
cheers and laughter and sobs such as only managers have the art of
drawing from the theatrical gentlemen and ladies in their employ It
was observed especially among the chorussingers at the bottom of the
table that their emotion was intense They had a meeting the next day
and voted a piece of plate to Adolphus Slang Esquire for his eminent
services in the cause of the drama

Walker returned thanks for his lady That was he said the proudest
moment of his life He was proud to think that he had educated her for
the stage happy to think that his sufferings had not been in vain and
that his exertions in her behalf were crowned with full success In her
name and his own he thanked the company and sat down and was once more
particularly attentive to Mademoiselle Flicflac

Then came an oration from Sir George Thrum in reply to Slangs toast
to HIM It was very much to the same effect as the speech by Walker
the two gentlemen attributing to themselves individually the merit of
bringing out Mrs Walker He concluded by stating that he should always
hold Mrs Walker as the daughter of his heart and to the last moment of
his life should love and cherish her It is certain that Sir George was
exceedingly elated that night and would have been scolded by his lady
on his return home but for the triumph of the evening

Mulligans speech of thanks as author of the Brigands Bride was it
must be confessed extremely tedious It seemed there would be no end
to it when he got upon the subject of Ireland especially which somehow
was found to be intimately connected with the interests of music and the
theatre Even the choristers poohpoohed this speech coming though it
did from the successful author whose songs of wine love and battle
they had been repeating that night

The Brigands Bride ran for many nights Its choruses were tuned on
the organs of the day Morgianas airs The Rose upon my Balcony
and the Lightning on the Cataract recitative and scena were on
everybodys lips and brought so many guineas to Sir George Thrum that
he was encouraged to have his portrait engraved which still may be
seen in the musicshops Not many persons I believe bought proof
impressions of the plate price two guineas whereas on the contrary
all the young clerks in banks and all the FAST young men of the
universities had pictures of the Ravenswing in their apartmentsas
Biondetta the brigands bride as Zelyma in the Nuptials of
Benares as Barbareska in the Mine of Tobolsk and in all her
famous characters In the latter she disguises herself as a Uhlan in
order to save her father who is in prison and the Ravenswing looked so
fascinating in this costume in pantaloons and yellow boots that Slang
was for having her instantly in Captain Macheath whence arose their
quarrel

She was replaced at Slangs theatre by Snooks the rhinocerostamer
with his breed of wild buffaloes Their success was immense Slang gave
a supper at which all the company burst into tears and assembling
in the greenroom next day they as usual voted a piece of plate to
Adolphus Slang Esquire for his eminent services to the drama

In the Captain Macheath dispute Mr Walker would have had his wife
yield but on this point and for once she disobeyed her husband and
left the theatre And when Walker cursed her according to his wont for
her abominable selfishness and disregard of his property she burst
into tears and said she had spent but twenty guineas on herself and baby
during the year that her theatrical dressmakers bills were yet unpaid
and that she had never asked him how much he spent on that odious French
figurante

All this was true except about the French figurante Walker as the
lord and master received all Morgianas earnings and spent them as
a gentleman should He gave very neat dinners at a cottage in Regents
Park Mr and Mrs Walker lived at Green Street Grosvenor Square he
played a good deal at the Regent but as to the French figurante it
must be confessed that Mrs Walker was in a sad error THAT lady and
the Captain had parted long ago it was Madame Dolores de TrasosMontes
who inhabited the cottage in St Johns Wood now

But if some little errors of this kind might be attributable to the
Captain on the other hand when his wife was in the provinces he was
the most attentive of husbands made all her bargains and received
every shilling before he would permit her to sing a note Thus he
prevented her from being cheated as a person of her easy temper
doubtless would have been by designing managers and needy
concertgivers They always travelled with four horses and Walker was
adored in every one of the principal hotels in England The waiters flew
at his bell The chambermaids were afraid he was a sad naughty man and
thought his wife no such great beauty the landlords preferred him to
any duke HE never looked at their bills not he In fact his income was
at least four thousand a year for some years of his life

Master Woolsey Walker was put to Doctor Wapshots seminary whence
after many disputes on the Doctors part as to getting his halfyears
accounts paid and after much complaint of illtreatment on the little
boys side he was withdrawn and placed under the care of the Reverend
Mr Swishtail at Turnham Green where all his bills are paid by his
godfather now the head of the firm of Woolsey and Co

As a gentleman Mr Walker still declines to see him but he has not
as far as I have heard paid the sums of money which he threatened to
refund and as he is seldom at home the worthy tailor can come to Green
Street at his leisure He and Mrs Crump and Mrs Walker often take the
omnibus to Brentford and a cake with them to little Woolsey at school
to whom the tailor says he will leave every shilling of his property

The Walkers have no other children but when she takes her airing in the
Park she always turns away at the sight of a low phaeton in which sits
a woman with rouged cheeks and a great number of overdressed children
and a French bonne whose name I am given to understand is Madame
Dolores de TrasosMontes Madame de TrasosMontes always puts a great
gold glass to her eye as the Ravenswings carriage passes and looks
into it with a sneer The two coachmen used always to exchange queer
winks at each other in the ring until Madame de TrasosMontes lately
adopted a tremendous chasseur with huge whiskers and a green and gold
livery since which time the formerly named gentlemen do not recognise
each other

The Ravenswings life is one of perpetual triumph on the stage and as
every one of the fashionable men about town have been in love with her
you may fancy what a pretty character she has Lady Thrum would die
sooner than speak to that unhappy young woman and in fact the Thrums
have a new pupil who is a siren without the dangerous qualities of one
who has the person of Venus and the mind of a Muse and who is coming
out at one of the theatres immediately Baroski says De liddle
Rafenschwing is just as font of me as effer People are very shy about
receiving her in society and when she goes to sing at a concert Miss
Prim starts up and skurries off in a state of the greatest alarm lest
that person should speak to her

Walker is voted a good easy rattling gentlemanly fellow and nobodys
enemy but his own His wife they say is dreadfully extravagant and
indeed since his marriage and in spite of his wifes large income
he has been in the Bench several times but she signs some bills and
he comes out again and is as gay and genial as ever All mercantile
speculations he has wisely long since given up he likes to throw a
main of an evening as I have said and to take his couple of bottles at
dinner On Friday he attends at the theatre for his wifes salary and
transacts no other business during the week He grows exceedingly stout
dyes his hair and has a bloated purple look about the nose and cheeks
very different from that which first charmed the heart of Morgiana

By the way Eglantine has been turned out of the Bower of Bloom and now
keeps a shop at Tunbridge Wells Going down thither last year without a
razor I asked a fat seedy man lolling in a faded nankeen jacket at the
door of a tawdry little shop in the Pantiles to shave me He said in
reply Sir I do not practise in that branch of the profession and
turned back into the little shop It was Archibald Eglantine But in the
wreck of his fortunes he still has his captains uniform and his grand
cross of the order of the Castle and Falcon of Panama

 

POSTSCRIPT

G FitzBoodle Esq to O Yorke Esq

ZUM TRIERISCHEN HOP COBLENZ July 10 1843

MY DEAR YORKEThe story of the Ravenswing was written a long time
since and I never could account for the bad taste of the publishers of
the metropolis who refused it an insertion in their various magazines
This fact would never have been alluded to but for the following
circumstance

Only yesterday as I was dining at this excellent hotel I remarked a
baldheaded gentleman in a blue coat and brass buttons who looked
like a colonel on halfpay and by his side a lady and a little boy
of twelve whom the gentleman was cramming with an amazing quantity of
cherries and cakes A stout old dame in a wonderful cap and ribands was
seated by the ladys side and it was easy to see they were English and
I thought I had already made their acquaintance elsewhere

The younger of the ladies at last made a bow with an accompanying blush

Surely said I I have the honour of speaking to Mrs Ravenswing

Mrs Woolsey sir said the gentleman my wife has long since left
the stage and at this the old lady in the wonderful cap trod on my
toes very severely and nodded her head and all her ribands in a most
mysterious way Presently the two ladies rose and left the table the
elder declaring that she heard the baby crying

Woolsey my dear go with your mamma said Mr Woolsey patting the
boy on the head The young gentleman obeyed the command carrying off a
plate of macaroons with him

Your son is a fine boy sir said I

My stepson sir answered Mr Woolsey and added in a louder voice
I knew you Mr FitzBoodle at once but did not mention your name
for fear of agitating my wife She dont like to have the memory of old
times renewed sir her former husband whom you know Captain Walker
made her very unhappy He died in America sir of this I fear
pointing to the bottle and Mrs W quitted the stage a year before I
quitted business Are you going on to Wiesbaden

They went off in their carriage that evening the boy on the box making
great efforts to blow out of the postilions tasselled horn

I am glad that poor Morgiana is happy at last and hasten to inform
you of the fact I am going to visit the old haunts of my youth at
Pumpernickel Adieu

Yours

MR AND MRS FRANK BERRY



CHAPTER I THE FIGHT AT SLAUGHTER HOUSE

I am very fond of reading about battles and have most of Marlboroughs
and Wellingtons at my fingers ends but the most tremendous combat I
ever saw and one that interests me to think of more than Malplaquet or
Waterloo which by the way has grown to be a downright nuisance so
much do men talk of it after dinner prating most disgustingly about
the Prussians coming up and what notI say the most tremendous
combat ever known was that between Berry and Biggs the gownboy which
commenced in a certain place called Middle Briars situated in the midst
of the cloisters that run along the side of the playground of Slaughter
House School near Smithfield London It was there madam that your
humble servant had the honour of acquiring after six years labour
that immense fund of classical knowledge which in after life has been so
exceedingly useful to him

The circumstances of the quarrel were theseBiggs the gownboy a
man who in those days I thought was at least seven feet high and was
quite thunderstruck to find in after life that he measured no more than
five feet four was what we called second cock of the school the
first cock was a great big goodhumoured lazy fairhaired fellow
Old Hawkins by name who because he was large and goodhumoured hurt
nobody Biggs on the contrary was a sad bully he had halfadozen
fags and beat them all unmercifully Moreover he had a little brother
a boarder in Potkys house whom as a matter of course he hated and
maltreated worse than anyone else

Well one day because young Biggs had not brought his brother his
hoops or had not caught a ball at cricket or for some other equally
good reason Biggs the elder so belaboured the poor little fellow that
Berry who was sauntering by and saw the dreadful blows which the
elder brother was dealing to the younger with his hockeystick felt
a compassion for the little fellow perhaps he had a jealousy against
Biggs and wanted to try a few rounds with him but that I cant vouch
for however Berry passing by stopped and said Dont you think
you have thrashed the boy enough Biggs He spoke this in a very civil
tone for he never would have thought of interfering rudely with the
sacred privilege that an upper boy at a public school always has of
beating a junior especially when they happen to be brothers

The reply of Biggs as might be expected was to hit young Biggs with
the hockeystick twice as hard as before until the little wretch howled
with pain I suppose its no business of yours Berry said Biggs
thumping away all the while and laid on worse and worse

Until Berry and indeed little Biggs could bear it no longer and the
former bouncing forward wrenched the stick out of old Biggss hands
and sent it whirling out of the cloister window to the great wonder of
a crowd of us small boys who were looking on Little boys always like
to see a little companion of their own soundly beaten

There said Berry looking into Biggss face as much as to say Ive
gone and done it and he added to the brother Scud away you little
thief Ive saved you this time

Stop young Biggs roared out his brother after a pause or Ill
break every bone in your infernal scoundrelly skin

Young Biggs looked at Berry then at his brother then came at his
brothers order as if back to be beaten again but lost heart and ran
away as fast as his little legs could carry him

Ill do for him another time said Biggs Here underboy take my
coat and we all began to gather round and formed a ring

We had better wait till after school Biggs cried Berry quite cool
but looking a little pale There are only five minutes now and it will
take you more than that to thrash me

Biggs upon this committed a great error for he struck Berry slightly
across the face with the back of his hand saying You are in a funk
But this was a feeling which Frank Berry did not in the least entertain
for in reply to Biggss backhander and as quick as thought and with
all his might and mainpong he delivered a blow upon old Biggss nose
that made the claret spirt and sent the second cock down to the ground
as if he had been shot

He was up again however in a minute his face white and gashed with
blood his eyes glaring a ghastly spectacle and Berry meanwhile
had taken his coat off and by this time there were gathered in the
cloisters on all the windows and upon each others shoulders one
hundred and twenty young gentlemen at the very least for the news had
gone out through the playground of a fight between Berry and Biggs

But Berry was quite right in his remark about the propriety of deferring
the business for at this minute Mr Chip the second master came down
the cloisters going into school and grinned in his queer way as he saw
the state of Biggss face Holloa Mr Biggs said he I suppose you
have run against a fingerpost That was the regular joke with us at
school and you may be sure we all laughed heartily as we always did
when Mr Chip made a joke or anything like a joke You had better go
to the pump sir and get yourself washed and not let Doctor Buckle see
you in that condition So saying Mr Chip disappeared to his duties in
the underschool whither all we little boys followed him

It was Wednesday a halfholiday as everybody knows and boiledbeef
day at Slaughter House I was in the same boardinghouse with Berry
and we all looked to see whether he ate a good dinner just as one would
examine a man who was going to be hanged I recollected in afterlife
in Germany seeing a friend who was going to fight a duel eat five larks
for his breakfast and thought I had seldom witnessed greater courage
Berry ate moderately of the boiled beefBOILED CHILD we used to call it
at school in our elegant jocular way he knew a great deal better than
to load his stomach upon the eve of such a contest as was going to take
place

Dinner was very soon over and Mr Chip who had been all the while
joking Berry and pressing him to eat called him up into his study
to the great disappointment of us all for we thought he was going to
prevent the fight but no such thing The Reverend Edward Chip took
Berry into his study and poured him out two glasses of portwine which
he made him take with a biscuit and patted him on the back and went
off I have no doubt he was longing like all of us to see the battle
but etiquette you know forbade

When we went out into the green Old Hawkins was therethe great
Hawkins the cock of the school I have never seen the man since but
still think of him as of something awful gigantic mysterious he who
could thrash everybody who could beat all the masters how we longed
for him to put in his hand and lick Buckle He was a dull boy not very
high in the school and had all his exercises written for him Buckle
knew this but respected him never called him up to read Greek plays
passed over all his blunders which were many let him go out of
halfholidays into the town as he pleased how should any man dare to
stop himthe great calm magnanimous silent Strength They say he licked
a LifeGuardsman I wonder whether it was Shaw who killed all those
Frenchmen No it could not be Shaw for he was dead au champ dhonneur
but he WOULD have licked Shaw if he had been alive A bargeman I know he
licked at Jack Randalls in Slaughter House Lane Old Hawkins was too
lazy to play at cricket he sauntered all day in the sunshine about the
green accompanied by little Tippins who was in the sixth form laughed
and joked at Hawkins eternally and was the person who wrote all his
exercises

Instead of going into town this afternoon Hawkins remained at Slaughter
House to see the great fight between the second and third cocks

The different masters of the school kept boardinghouses such as
Potkys Chips Wickenss Pinneys and so on and the playground or
green as it was called although the only thing green about the place
was the broken glass on the walls that separate Slaughter House from
Wilderness Row and Goswell Streetmany a time have I seen Mr Pickwick
look out of his window in that street though we did not know him
thenthe playground or green was common to all But if any stray
boy from Potkys was found for instance in or entering into Chips
house the most dreadful tortures were practised upon him as I can
answer in my own case

Fancy then our astonishment at seeing a little threefoot wretch of
the name of Wills one of Hawkinss fags they were both in Potkys
walk undismayed amongst us lions at Chips house as the rich and rare
young lady did in Ireland We were going to set upon him and devour or
otherwise maltreat him when he cried out in a little shrill impertinent
voice TELL BERRY I WANT HIM

We all roared with laughter Berry was in the sixth form and Wills or
any underboy would as soon have thought of wanting him as I should
of wanting the Duke of Wellington

Little Wills looked round in an imperious kind of way Well says he
stamping his foot do you hear TELL BERRY THAT HAWKINS WANTS HIM

As for resisting the law of Hawkins you might as soon think of
resisting immortal Jove Berry and Tolmash who was to be his
bottleholder made their appearance immediately and walked out into
the green where Hawkins was waiting and with an irresistible audacity
that only belonged to himself in the face of nature and all the
regulations of the place was smoking a cigar When Berry and Tolmash
found him the three began slowly pacing up and down in the sunshine
and we little boys watched them

Hawkins moved his arms and hands every now and then and was evidently
laying down the law about boxing We saw his fists darting out every now
and then with mysterious swiftness hitting one two quick as thought
as if in the face of an adversary now his left hand went up as if
guarding his own head now his immense right fist dreadfully flapped
the air as if punishing his imaginary opponents miserable ribs The
conversation lasted for some ten minutes about which time gownboys
dinner was over and we saw these youths in their black hornedbutton
jackets and kneebreeches issuing from their door in the cloisters
There were no hoops no cricketbats as usual on a halfholiday Who
would have thought of play in expectation of such tremendous sport as
was in store for us

Towering among the gownboys of whom he was the head and the tyrant
leaning upon Bushbys arm and followed at a little distance by many
curious pale awestricken boys dressed in his black silk stockings
which he always sported and with a crimson bandanna tied round his
waist came BIGGS His nose was swollen with the blow given before
school but his eyes flashed fire He was laughing and sneering with
Bushby and evidently intended to make minced meat of Berry

The betting began pretty freely the bets were against poor Berry Five
to three were offeredin gingerbeer I took six to four in raspberry
open tarts The upper boys carried the thing farther still and I know
for a fact that Swangs book amounted to four pound three but he
hedged a good deal and Tittery lost seventeen shillings in a single
bet to Pitts who took the odds

As Biggs and his party arrived I heard Hawkins say to Berry For
heavens sake my boy fib with your right and MIND HIS LEFT HAND

Middle Briars was voted to be too confined a space for the combat and
it was agreed that it should take place behind the underschool in
the shade whither we all went Hawkins with his immense silver
huntingwatch kept the time and water was brought from the pump close
to Notleys the pastrycooks who did not admire fisticuffs at all on
halfholidays for the fights kept the boys away from his shop Gutley
was the only fellow in the school who remained faithful to him and
he sat on the counterthe great gormandising bruteeating tarts the
whole day

This famous fight as every Slaughter House man knows lasted for two
hours and twentynine minutes by Hawkinss immense watch All this time
the air resounded with cries of Go it Berry Go it Biggs Pitch
into him Give it him and so on Shall I describe the hundred and
two rounds of the combatNoIt would occupy too much space and the
taste for such descriptions has passed away 3

1st round Both the combatants fresh and in prime order The weight
and inches somewhat on the gownboys side Berry goes gallantly in
and delivers a clinker on the gownboys jaw Biggs makes play with his
left Berry down

 

4th round Claret drawn in profusion from the gownboys grogshop He
went down and had his front tooth knocked out but the blow cut Berrys
knuckles a great deal

 

15th round Chancery Fibbing Biggs makes dreadful work with his
left Break away Rally Biggs down Betting still six to four on the
gownboy

 

20th round The men both dreadfully punished Berry somewhat shy of his
adversarys left hand

 

29th to 42nd round The Chipsite all this while breaks away from the
gownboys left and goes down on a knee Six to four on the gownboy
until the fortieth round when the bets became equal

 

102nd and last round For halfanhour the men had stood up to each
other but were almost too weary to strike The gownboys face hardly
to be recognised swollen and streaming with blood The Chipsite in
a similar condition and still more punished about his side from his
enemys left hand Berry gives a blow at his adversarys face and falls
over him as he falls

The gownboy cant come up to time And thus ended the great fight of
Berry and Biggs

And what pray has this horrid description of a battle and parcel of
schoolboys to do with Mens Wives

What has it to do with Mens WivesA great deal more madam than you
think for Only read Chapter II and you shall hear



CHAPTER II THE COMBAT AT VERSAILLES

I afterwards came to be Berrys fag and though beaten by him daily he
allowed of course no one else to lay a hand upon me and I got no more
thrashing than was good for me Thus an intimacy grew up between us
and after he left Slaughter House and went into the dragoons the honest
fellow did not forget his old friend but actually made his appearance
one day in the playground in moustaches and a braided coat and gave
me a gold pencilcase and a couple of sovereigns I blushed when I took
them but take them I did and I think the thing I almost best recollect
in my life is the sight of Berry getting behind an immense bay
cabhorse which was held by a correct little groom and was waiting
near the school in Slaughter House Square He proposed too to have me
to Longs where he was lodging for the time but this invitation
was refused on my behalf by Doctor Buckle who said and possibly with
correctness that I should get little good by spending my holiday with
such a scapegrace

Once afterwards he came to see me at Christ Church and we made a show
of writing to one another and didnt and always had a hearty mutual
goodwill and though we did not quite burst into tears on parting were
yet quite happy when occasion threw us together and so almost lost
sight of each other I heard lately that Berry was married and am
rather ashamed to say that I was not so curious as even to ask the
maiden name of his lady

Last summer I was at Paris and had gone over to Versailles to meet a
party one of which was a young lady to whom I was tenderlyBut never
mind The day was rainy and the party did not keep its appointment
and after yawning through the interminable Palace picturegalleries and
then making an attempt to smoke a cigar in the Palace gardenfor which
crime I was nearly run through the body by a rascally sentinelI was
driven perforce into the great bleak lonely place before the Palace
with its roads branching off to all the towns in the world which Louis
and Napoleon once intended to conquer and there enjoyed my favourite
pursuit at leisure and was meditating whether I should go back to
Vefours for dinner or patronise my friend M Duboux of the Hotel
des Reservoirs who gives not only a good dinner but as dear a one as
heart can desire I was I say meditating these things when a carriage
passed by It was a smart low calash with a pair of bay horses and a
postilion in a drab jacket that twinkled with innumerable buttons and
I was too much occupied in admiring the build of the machine and
the extreme tightness of the fellows inexpressibles to look at the
personages within the carriage when the gentleman roared out Fitz
and the postilion pulled up and the lady gave a shrill scream and
a little blackmuzzled spaniel began barking and yelling with all his
might and a man with moustaches jumped out of the vehicle and began
shaking me by the hand

Drive home John said the gentleman Ill be with you my love in
an instantits an old friend Fitz let me present you to Mrs Berry

The lady made an exceedingly gentle inclination of her blackvelvet
bonnet and said Pray my love remember that it is just dinnertime
However never mind ME And with another slight toss and a nod to the
postilion that individuals white leather breeches began to jump up
and down again in the saddle and the carriage disappeared leaving me
shaking my old friend Berry by the hand

He had long quitted the army but still wore his military beard
which gave to his fair pink face a fierce and lionlike look He was
extraordinarily glad to see me as only men are glad who live in a small
town or in dull company There is no destroyer of friendships like
London where a man has no time to think of his neighbour and has
far too many friends to care for them He told me in a breath of his
marriage and how happy he was and straight insisted that I must
come home to dinner and see more of Angelica who had invited me
herselfdidnt I hear her

Mrs Berry asked YOU Frank but I certainly did not hear her ask ME

She would not have mentioned the dinner but that she meant me to ask
you I know she did cried Frank Berry And besideshang itIm
master of the house So come you shall No ceremony old boyone or two
friendssnug family partyand well talk of old times over a bottle of
claret

There did not seem to me to be the slightest objection to this
arrangement except that my boots were muddy and my coat of the morning
sort But as it was quite impossible to go to Paris and back again in
a quarter of an hour and as a man may dine with perfect comfort to
himself in a frockcoat it did not occur to me to be particularly
squeamish or to decline an old friends invitation upon a pretext so
trivial

Accordingly we walked to a small house in the Avenue de Paris and were
admitted first into a small garden ornamented by a grotto a fountain
and several nymphs in plasterofParis then up a mouldy old steep stair
into a hall where a statue of Cupid and another of Venus welcomed us
with their eternal simper then through a salleamanger where covers
were laid for six and finally to a little saloon where Fido the dog
began to howl furiously according to his wont

It was one of the old pavilions that had been built for a pleasurehouse
in the gay days of Versailles ornamented with abundance of damp Cupids
and cracked gilt cornices and old mirrors let into the walls and
gilded once but now painted a dingy French white The long low windows
looked into the court where the fountain played its ceaseless dribble
surrounded by numerous rank creepers and weedy flowers but in the midst
of which the statues stood with their bases quite moist and green

I hate fountains and statues in dark confined places that cheerless
endless plashing of water is the most inhospitable sound ever heard The
stiff grin of those French statues or ogling Canova Graces is by no
means more happy I think than the smile of a skeleton and not so
natural Those little pavilions in which the old roues sported were
never meant to be seen by daylight depend ont They were lighted up
with a hundred waxcandles and the little fountain yonder was meant
only to cool their claret And so my first impression of Berrys
place of abode was rather a dismal one However I heard him in the
salleamanger drawing the corks which went off with a CLOOP and that
consoled me

As for the furniture of the rooms appertaining to the Berrys there
was a harp in a leather case and a piano and a flutebox and a huge
tambour with a Saracens nose just begun and likewise on the table
a multiplicity of those little gilt books half sentimental and half
religious which the wants of the age and of our young ladies have
produced in such numbers of late I quarrel with no ladys taste in that
way but heigho I had rather that Mrs FitzBoodle should read Humphry
Clinker

Besides these works there was a Peerage of course What genteel
family was ever without one

I was making for the door to see Frank drawing the corks and was
bounced at by the amiable little blackmuzzled spaniel who fastened his
teeth in my pantaloons and received a polite kick in consequence which
sent him howling to the other end of the room and the animal was just
in the act of performing that feat of agility when the door opened
and madame made her appearance Frank came behind her peering over her
shoulder with rather an anxious look

Mrs Berry is an exceedingly white and lean person She has thick
eyebrows which meet rather dangerously over her nose which is Grecian
and a small mouth with no lipsa sort of feeble pucker in the face as
it were Under her eyebrows are a pair of enormous eyes which she is
in the habit of turning constantly ceilingwards Her hair is rather
scarce and worn in bandeaux and she commonly mounts a sprig of laurel
or a dark flower or two which with the sham tourI believe that is the
name of the knob of artificial hair that many ladies sportgives her
a rigid and classical look She is dressed in black and has invariably
the neatest of silk stockings and shoes for forsooth her foot is a fine
one and she always sits with it before her looking at it stamping it
and admiring it a great deal Fido she says to her spaniel you have
almost crushed my poor foot or Frank to her husband bring me a
footstool or I suffer so from cold in the feet and so forth but
be the conversation what it will she is always sure to put HER FOOT
into it

She invariably wears on her neck the miniature of her late father Sir
George Catacomb apothecary to George III and she thinks those two men
the greatest the world ever saw She was born in Baker Street Portman
Square and that is saying almost enough of her She is as long as
genteel and as dreary as that deadlylively place and sports by
way of ornament her papas hatchment as it were as every tenth Baker
Street house has taught her

What induced such a jolly fellow as Frank Berry to marry Miss Angelica
Catacomb no one can tell He met her he says at a ball at Hampton
Court where his regiment was quartered and where to this day lives
her aunt Lady Pash She alludes perpetually in conversation to that
celebrated lady and if you look in the Baronetage to the pedigree
of the Pash family you may see manuscript notes by Mrs Frank Berry
relative to them and herself Thus when you see in print that Sir John
Pash married Angelica daughter of Graves Catacomb Esquire in a neat
hand you find written AND SISTER OF THE LATE SIR GEORGE CATACOMB OF
BAKER STREET PORTMAN SQUARE AB follows of course It is a wonder
how fond ladies are of writing in books and signing their charming
initials Mrs Berrys beforementioned little gilt books are scored
with pencilmarks or occasionally at the margin with anote of
interjection or the words TOO TRUE AB and so on Much may be
learned with regard to lovely woman by a look at the books she reads in
and I had gained no inconsiderable knowledge of Mrs Berry by the ten
minutes spent in the drawingroom while she was at her toilet in the
adjoining bedchamber

You have often heard me talk of George Fitz says Berry with an
appealing look to madame

Very often answered his lady in a tone which clearly meant a great
deal too much Pray sir continued she looking at my boots with all
her might are we to have your company at dinner

Of course you are my dear what else do you think he came for You
would not have the man go back to Paris to get his evening coat would
you

At least my love I hope you will go and put on YOURS and change
those muddy boots Lady Pash will be here in five minutes and you know
Dobus is as punctual as clockwork Then turning to me with a sort of
apology that was as consoling as a box on the ear We have some friends
at dinner sir who are rather particular persons but I am sure when
they hear that you only came on a sudden invitation they will excuse
your morning dressBah what a smell of smoke

With this speech madame placed herself majestically on a sofa put out
her foot called Fido and relapsed into an icy silence Frank had long
since evacuated the premises with a rueful look at his wife but never
daring to cast a glance at me I saw the whole business at once here
was this lion of a fellow tamed down by a she Van Amburgh and fetching
and carrying at her orders a great deal more obediently than her little
yowling blackmuzzled darling of a Fido

I am not however to be tamed so easily and was determined in this
instance not to be in the least disconcerted or to show the smallest
sign of illhumour so to renouer the conversation I began about Lady
Pash

I heard you mention the name of Pash I think said I I know a lady
of that name and a very ugly one it is too

It is most probably not the same person answered Mrs Berry with
a look which intimated that a fellow like me could never have had the
honour to know so exalted a person

I mean old Lady Pash of Hampton Court Fat womanfair aint sheand
wears an amethyst in her forehead has one eye a blond wig and dresses
in light green

Lady Pash sir is MY AUNT answered Mrs Berry not altogether
displeased although she expected money from the old lady but you know
we love to hear our friends abused when it can be safely done

Oh indeed she was a daughter of old Catacombs of Windsor I
remember the undertaker They called her husband Callipash and her
ladyship Pishpash So you see madam that I know the whole family

Mr FitzSimons exclaimed Mrs Berry rising I am not accustomed to
hear nicknames applied to myself and my family and must beg you
when you honour us with your company to spare our feelings as much as
possible Mr Catacomb had the confidence of his SOVEREIGN sir and Sir
John Pash was of Charles IIs creation The one was my uncle sir the
other my grandfather

My dear madam I am extremely sorry and most sincerely apologise
for my inadvertence But you owe me an apology too my name is not
FitzSimons but FitzBoodle

What of Boodle Hallmy husbands old friend of Charles Is
creation My dear sir I beg you a thousand pardons and am delighted
to welcome a person of whom I have heard Frank say so much Frank to
Berry who soon entered in very glossy boots and a white waistcoat do
you know darling I mistook Mr FitzBoodle for Mr FitzSimonsthat
horrid Irish horsedealing person and I never never never can pardon
myself for being so rude to him

The big eyes here assumed an expression that was intended to kill me
outright with kindness from being calm still reserved Angelica
suddenly became gay smiling confidential and folatre She told me she
had heard I was a sad creature and that she intended to reform me and
that I must come and see Frank a great deal

Now although Mr FitzSimons for whom I was mistaken is as low
a fellow as ever came out of Dublin and having been a captain in
somebodys army is now a blackleg and horsedealer by profession yet
if I had brought him home to Mrs FitzBoodle to dinner I should have
liked far better that that imaginary lady should have received him with
decent civility and not insulted the stranger within her husbands
gates And although it was delightful to be received so cordially
when the mistake was discovered yet I found that ALL Berrys old
acquaintances were by no means so warmly welcomed for another old
schoolchum presently made his appearance who was treated in a very
different manner

This was no other than poor Jack Butts who is a sort of small artist
and picturedealer by profession and was a dayboy at Slaughter House
when we were there and very serviceable in bringing in sausages
pots of pickles and other articles of merchandise which we could not
otherwise procure The poor fellow has been employed seemingly in the
same office of fetcher and carrier ever since and occupied that post
for Mrs Berry It was Mr Butts have you finished that drawing for
Lady Pashs album and Butts produced it and Did you match the silk
for me at Delilles and there was the silk bought no doubt with the
poor fellows last five francs and Did you go to the furnitureman in
the Rue St Jacques and bring the canaryseed and call about my
shawl at that odious dawdling Madame Fichets and have you brought the
guitarstrings

Butts hadnt brought the guitarstrings and thereupon Mrs Berrys
countenance assumed the same terrible expression which I had formerly
remarked in it and which made me tremble for Berry

My dear Angelica though said he with some spirit Jack Butts isnt
a baggagewaggon nor a Jackofalltrades you make him paint pictures
for your womens albums and look after your upholsterer and your
canarybird and your milliners and turn rusty because he forgets your
last message

I did not turn RUSTY Frank as you call it elegantly Im very much
obliged to Mr Butts for performing my commissionsvery much obliged
And as for not paying for the pictures to which you so kindly allude
Frank _I_ should never have thought of offering payment for so paltry a
service but Im sure I shall be happy to pay if Mr Butts will send me
in his bill

By Jove Angelica this is too much bounced out Berry but the little
matrimonial squabble was abruptly ended by Berrys French man flinging
open the door and announcing MILADI PASH and Doctor Dobus which two
personages made their appearance

The person of old Pash has been already parenthetically described But
quite different from her dismal niece in temperament she is as jolly an
old widow as ever wore weeds She was attached somehow to the Court and
has a multiplicity of stories about the princesses and the old King
to which Mrs Berry never fails to call your attention in her grave
important way Lady Pash has ridden many a time to the Windsor hounds
she made her husband become a member of the Fourinhand Club and has
numberless stories about Sir Godfrey Webster Sir John Lade and the
old heroes of those times She has lent a rouleau to Dick Sheridan
and remembers Lord Byron when he was a sulky slim young lad She says
Charles Fox was the pleasantest fellow she ever met with and has not
the slightest objection to inform you that one of the princes was very
much in love with her Yet somehow she is only fiftytwo years old and
I have never been able to understand her calculation One day or other
before her eye went out and before those pearly teeth of hers were
stuck to her gums by gold she must have been a prettylooking body
enough Yet in spite of the latter inconvenience she eats and
drinks too much every day and tosses off a glass of maraschino with a
trembling pudgy hand every finger of which twinkles with a dozen at
least of old rings She has a story about every one of those rings and
a stupid one too But there is always something pleasant I think in
stupid family stories they are goodhearted people who tell them

As for Mrs Muchit nothing need be said of her she is Pashs
companion she has lived with Lady Pash since the peace Nor does my
Lady take any more notice of her than of the dust of the earth She
calls her poor Muchit and considers her a halfwitted creature Mrs
Berry hates her cordially and thinks she is a designing toadeater
who has formed a conspiracy to rob her of her aunts fortune She never
spoke a word to poor Muchit during the whole of dinner or offered to
help her to anything on the table

In respect to Dobus he is an old Peninsular man as you are made to
know before you have been very long in his company and like most army
surgeons is a great deal more military in his looks and conversation
than the combatant part of the forces He has adopted the
shamDukeofWellington air which is by no means uncommon in veterans
and though one of the easiest and softest fellows in existence speaks
slowly and briefly and raps out an oath or two occasionally as it is
said a certain great captain does Besides the above we sat down to
table with Captain Goff late of the  Highlanders the Reverend
Lemuel Whey who preaches at St Germains little Cutler and the
Frenchman who always WILL be at English parties on the Continent and
who after making some frightful efforts to speak English subsides and
is heard no more Young married ladies and heads of families generally
have him for the purpose of waltzing and in return he informs his
friends of the club or the cafe that he has made the conquest of a
charmante Anglaise Listen to me all family men who read this and
never LET AN UNMARRIED FRENCHMAN INTO YOUR DOORS This lecture alone is
worth the price of the book It is not that they do any harm in one case
out of a thousand Heaven forbid but they mean harm They look on our
Susannas with unholy dishonest eyes Hearken to two of the grinning
rogues chattering together as they clink over the asphalte of
the Boulevard with lacquered boots and plastered hair and waxed
moustaches and turneddown shirtcollars and stays and goggling eyes
and hear how they talk of a good simple giddy vain dull Baker
Street creature and canvass her points and show her letters and
insinuatenever mind but I tell you my soul grows angry when I think
of the same and I cant hear of an Englishwoman marrying a Frenchman
without feeling a sort of shame and pity for her 4

To return to the guests The Reverend Lemuel Whey is a teaparty man
with a curl on his forehead and a scented pockethandkerchief He ties
his white neckcloth to a wonder and I believe sleeps in it He brings
his flute with him and prefers Handel of course but has one or two
pet profane songs of the sentimental kind and will occasionally lift
up his little pipe in a glee He does not dance but the honest fellow
would give the world to do it and he leaves his clogs in the passage
though it is a wonder he wears them for in the muddiest weather he
never has a speck on his foot He was at St Johns College Cambridge
and was rather gay for a term or two he says He is in a word full of
the milkandwater of human kindness and his family lives near Hackney

As for Goff he has a huge shining bald forehead and immense bristling
Indianred whiskers He wears white washleather gloves drinks fairly
likes a rubber and has a story for after dinner beginning Doctor ye
racklackt Sandy MLellan who joined us in the West Indies Wal sir
etc These and little Cutler made up the party

Now it may not have struck all readers but any sharp fellow conversant
with writing must have found out long ago that if there had been
something exceedingly interesting to narrate with regard to this dinner
at Frank Berrys I should have come out with it a couple of pages
since nor have kept the public looking for so long a time at the
dishcovers and ornaments of the table

But the simple fact must now be told that there was nothing of the
slightest importance occurred at this repast except that it gave me an
opportunity of studying Mrs Berry in many different ways and in spite
of the extreme complaisance which she now showed me of forming I am
sorry to say a most unfavourable opinion of that fair lady Truth to
tell I would much rather she should have been civil to Mrs Muchit
than outrageously complimentary to your humble servant and as she
professed not to know what on earth there was for dinner would it not
have been much more natural for her not to frown and bob and wink
and point and pinch her lips as often as Monsieur Anatole her French
domestic not knowing the ways of English dinnertables placed anything
out of its due order The allusions to Boodle Hall were innumerable
and I dont know any greater bore than to be obliged to talk of a place
which belongs to ones elder brother Many questions were likewise asked
about the dowager and her Scotch relatives the Plumduffs about whom
Lady Pash knew a great deal having seen them at Court and at Lord
Melvilles Of course she had seen them at Court and at Lord Melvilles
as she might have seen thousands of Scotchmen besides but what mattered
it to me who care not a jot for old Lady FitzBoodle When you write
youll say you met an old friend of her Ladyships says Mrs Berry
and I faithfully promised I would when I wrote but if the New Post
Office paid us for writing letters as very possibly it will soon I
could not be bribed to send a line to old Lady Fitz

In a word I found that Berry like many simple fellows before him had
made choice of an imperious illhumoured and underbred female for a
wife and could see with half an eye that he was a great deal too much
her slave

The struggle was not over yet however Witness that little encounter
before dinner and once or twice the honest fellow replied rather
smartly during the repast taking especial care to atone as much
as possible for his wifes inattention to Jack and Mrs Muchit by
particular attention to those personages whom he helped to everything
round about and pressed perpetually to champagne he drank but little
himself for his amiable wifes eye was constantly fixed on him

Just at the conclusion of the dessert madame who had bouded Berry
during dinnertime became particularly gracious to her lord and master
and tenderly asked me if I did not think the French custom was a good
one of men leaving table with the ladies

Upon my word maam says I I think its a most abominable
practice

And so do I says Cutler

A most abominable practice Do you hear THAT cries Berry laughing
and filling his glass

Im sure Frank when we are alone you always come to the
drawingroom replies the lady sharply

Oh yes when were alone darling says Berry blushing but now
were NOT aloneha ha Anatole du Bordeaux

Im sure they sat after the ladies at Carlton House didnt they Lady
Pash says Dobus who likes his glass

THAT they did says my Lady giving him a jolly nod

I racklackt exclaims Captain Goff when I was in the Mauritius that
Mestress MacWhirter who commanded the SaxtySackond used to say Mac
if ye want to get lively yell not stop for more than two hours after
the leddies have laft ye if ye want to get drunk yell just dine at
the mass So ye see Mestress Barry what was Macs allowancehaw
haw Mester Whey Ill trouble ye for the olives

But although we were in a clear majority that indomitable woman Mrs
Berry determined to make us all as uneasy as possible and would take
the votes all round Poor Jack of course sided with her and Whey said
he loved a cup of tea and a little music better than all the wine of
Bordeaux As for the Frenchman when Mrs Berry said And what do you
think M le Vicomte

Vat you speak said M de Blagueval breaking silence for the first
time during two hours Yaseeh to me you speak

Apry deeny aimyvoo ally avec les dam

Comment avec les dames

Ally avec les dam com a Parry ou resty avec les Messew com on
Onglyterre

Ah madame vous me le demandez cries the little wretch starting up
in a theatrical way and putting out his hand which Mrs Berry took
and with this the ladies left the room Old Lady Pash trotted after her
niece with her hand in Wheys very much wondering at such practices
which were not in the least in vogue in the reign of George III

Mrs Berry cast a glance of triumph at her husband at the defection
and Berry was evidently annoyed that threeeighths of his male forces
had left him

But fancy our delight and astonishment when in a minute they all three
came back again the Frenchman looking entirely astonished and the
parson and the painter both very queer The fact is old downright Lady
Pash who had never been in Paris in her life before and had no notion
of being deprived of her usual hours respite and nap said at once to
Mrs Berry My dear Angelica youre surely not going to keep these
three men here Send them back to the diningroom for Ive a thousand
things to say to you And Angelica who expects to inherit her aunts
property of course did as she was bid on which the old lady fell into
an easy chair and fell asleep immediatelyso soon that is as
the shout caused by the reappearance of the three gentlemen in the
diningroom had subsided

I had meanwhile had some private conversation with little Cutler
regarding the character of Mrs Berry Shes a regular screw
whispered he a regular Tartar Berry shows fight though sometimes
and Ive known him have his own way for a week together After dinner
he is his own master and hers when he has had his share of wine and
thats why she will never allow him to drink any

Was it a wicked or was it a noble and honourable thought which came
to us both at the same minute to rescue Berry from his captivity The
ladies of course will give their verdict according to their gentle
natures but I know what men of courage will think and by their jovial
judgment will abide

We received then the three lost sheep back into our innocent fold
again with the most joyous shouting and cheering We made Berry who
was in truth nothing loth order up I dont know how much more claret
We obliged the Frenchman to drink malgre lui and in the course of
a short time we had poor Whey in such a state of excitement that he
actually volunteered to sing a song which he said he had heard at some
very gay supperparty at Cambridge and which begins

 A pye sat on a peartree
 A pye sat on a peartree
 A pye sat on a peartree
 Heighho heighho heighho

Fancy Mrs Berrys face as she looked in in the midst of that
Bacchanalian ditty when she saw no less a person than the Reverend
Lemuel Whey carolling it

Is it you my dear cries Berry as brave now as any Petruchio Come
in and sit down and hear Wheys song

Lady Pash is asleep Frank said she

Well darling thats the very reason Give Mrs Berry a glass Jack
will you

Would you wake your aunt sir hissed out madame

NEVER MIND ME LOVE IM AWAKE AND LIKE IT cried the venerable Lady
Pash from the salon Sing away gentlemen

At which we all set up an audacious cheer and Mrs Berry flounced back
to the drawingroom but did not leave the door open that her aunt
might hear our melodies

Berry had by this time arrived at that confidential state to which a
third bottle always brings the wellregulated mind and he made a clean
confession to Cutler and myself of his numerous matrimonial annoyances
He was not allowed to dine out he said and but seldom to ask his
friends to meet him at home He never dared smoke a cigar for the life
of him not even in the stables He spent the mornings dawdling in
eternal shops the evenings at endless teaparties or in reading
poems or missionary tracts to his wife He was compelled to take physic
whenever she thought he looked a little pale to change his shoes and
stockings whenever he came in from a walk Look here said he opening
his chest and shaking his fist at Dobus look what Angelica and that
infernal Dobus have brought me to

I thought it might be a flannel waistcoat into which madame had
forced him but it was worse I give you my word of honour it was a
PITCHPLASTER

We all roared at this and the doctor as loud as anyone but he vowed
that he had no hand in the pitchplaster It was a favourite family
remedy of the late apothecary Sir George Catacomb and had been put on
by Mrs Berrys own fair hands

When Anatole came in with coffee Berry was in such high courage that
he told him to go to the deuce with it and we never caught sight of
Lady Pash more except when muffled up to the nose she passed through
the salleamanger to go to her carriage in which Dobus and the parson
were likewise to be transported to Paris Be a man Frank says she
and hold your ownfor the good old lady had taken her nephews part
in the matrimonial businessand you Mr FitzBoodle come and see him
often Youre a good fellow take old oneeyed Callipashs word for it
Shall I take you to Paris

Dear kind Angelica she had told her aunt all I said

Dont go George says Berry squeezing me by the hand So I said I
was going to sleep at Versailles that night but if she would give a
convoy to Jack Butts it would be conferring a great obligation on him
with which favour the old lady accordingly complied saying to him
with great coolness Get up and sit with John in the rumble Mr
Whatdyecallim The fact is the good old soul despises an artist
as much as she does a tailor

Jack tripped to his place very meekly and Remember Saturday cried
the Doctor and Dont forget Thursday exclaimed the divinea
bachelors party you know And so the cavalcade drove thundering down
the gloomy old Avenue de Paris

The Frenchman I forgot to say had gone away exceedingly ill long
before and the reminiscences of Thursday and Saturday evoked by
Dobus and Whey were to tell the truth parts of our conspiracy for in
the heat of Berrys courage we had made him promise to dine with us all
round en garcon with all except Captain Goff who racklacted that he
was engaged every day for the next three weeks as indeed he is to
a thirtysous ordinary which the gallant officer frequents when not
invited elsewhere

Cutler and I then were the last on the field and though we were for
moving away Berry whose vigour had if possible been excited by the
bustle and colloquy in the night air insisted upon dragging us back
again and actually proposed a grill for supper

We found in the salleamanger a strong smell of an extinguished lamp
and Mrs Berry was snuffing out the candles on the sideboard

Hullo my dear shouts Berry easy if you please weve not done
yet

Not done yet Mr Berry groans the lady in a hollow sepulchral tone

No Mrs B not done yet We are going to have some supper aint we
George

I think its quite time to go home said Mr FitzBoodle who to say
the truth began to tremble himself

I think it is sir you are quite right sir you will pardon me
gentlemen I have a bad headache and will retire

Goodnight my dear said that audacious Berry Anatole tell the
cook to broil a fowl and bring some wine

If the loving couple had been alone or if Cutler had not been an
attache to the embassy before whom she was afraid of making herself
ridiculous I am confident that Mrs Berry would have fainted away on
the spot and that all Berrys courage would have tumbled down lifeless
by the side of her So she only gave a martyrised look and left the
room and while we partook of the very unnecessary repast was good
enough to sing some hymntunes to an exceedingly slow movement in the
next room intimating that she was awake and that though suffering
she found her consolations in religion

These melodies did not in the least add to our friends courage The
devilled fowl had somehow no devil in it The champagne in the glasses
looked exceedingly flat and blue The fact is that Cutler and I were
now both in a state of dire consternation and soon made a move for
our hats and lighting each a cigar in the hall made across the little
green where the Cupids and nymphs were listening to the dribbling
fountain in the dark

Im hanged if I dont have a cigar too says Berry rushing after us
and accordingly putting in his pocket a key about the size of a shovel
which hung by the little handle of the outer grille forth he sallied
and joined us in our fumigation

He stayed with us a couple of hours and returned homewards in perfect
good spirits having given me his word of honour he would dine with us
the next day He put his immense key into the grille and unlocked it
but the gate would not open IT WAS BOLTED WITHIN

He began to make a furious jangling and ringing at the bell and in
oaths both French and English called upon the recalcitrant Anatole

After much tolling of the bell a light came cutting across the crevices
of the inner door it was thrown open and a figure appeared with a
lampa tall slim figure of a woman clothed in white from head to
foot

It was Mrs Berry and when Cutler and I saw her we both ran away as
fast as our legs could carry us

Berry at this shrieked with a wild laughter Remember tomorrow old
boys shouted hesix oclock and we were a quarter of a mile off
when the gate closed and the little mansion of the Avenue de Paris was
once more quiet and dark

The next afternoon as we were playing at billiards Cutler saw Mrs
Berry drive by in her carriage and as soon as rather a long rubber was
over I thought I would go and look for our poor friend and so went
down to the Pavilion Every door was open as the wont is in France and
I walked in unannounced and saw this

He was playing a duet with her on the flute She had been out but for
halfanhour after not speaking all the morning and having seen Cutler
at the billiardroom window and suspecting we might take advantage
of her absence she had suddenly returned home again and had flung
herself weeping into her Franks arms and said she could not bear to
leave him in anger And so after sitting for a little while sobbing on
his knee she had forgotten and forgiven every thing

The dear angel I met poor Frank in Bond Street only yesterday but he
crossed over to the other side of the way He had on goloshes and is
grown very fat and pale He has shaved off his moustaches and instead
wears a respirator He has taken his name off all his clubs and lives
very grimly in Baker Street Well ladies no doubt you say he is right
and what are the odds so long as YOU are happy




DENNIS HAGGARTYS WIFE


There was an odious Irishwoman who with her daughter used to frequent
the Royal Hotel at Leamington some years ago and who went by the name
of Mrs Major Gam Gam had been a distinguished officer in His Majestys
service whom nothing but death and his own amiable wife could overcome
The widow mourned her husband in the most becoming bombazeen she could
muster and had at least half an inch of lampblack round the immense
visiting tickets which she left at the houses of the nobility and gentry
her friends

Some of us I am sorry to say used to call her Mrs Major Gammon for
if the worthy widow had a propensity it was to talk largely of herself
and family of her own family for she held her husbands very cheap
and of the wonders of her paternal mansion Molloyville county of Mayo
She was of the Molloys of that county and though I never heard of the
family before I have little doubt from what Mrs Major Gam stated
that they were the most ancient and illustrious family of that part of
Ireland I remember there came down to see his aunt a young fellow
with huge red whiskers and tight nankeens a green coat and an awful
breastpin who after two days stay at the Spa proposed marriage to
Miss S or in default a duel with her father and who drove a
flash curricle with a bay and a grey and who was presented with much
pride by Mrs Gam as Castlereagh Molloy of Molloyville We all agreed
that he was the most insufferable snob of the whole season and were
delighted when a bailiff came down in search of him

Well this is all I know personally of the Molloyville family but at
the house if you met the widow Gam and talked on any subject in life
you were sure to hear of it If you asked her to have peas at dinner
she would say Oh sir after the peas at Molloyville I really dont
care for any othersdo I dearest Jemima We always had a dish in the
month of June when my father gave his head gardener a guinea we had
three at Molloyville and sent him with his compliments and a quart of
peas to our neighbour dear Lord Marrowfat What a sweet place Marrowfat
Park is isnt it Jemima If a carriage passed by the window Mrs
Major Gammon would be sure to tell you that there were three carriages
at Molloyville the barouche the chawiot and the covered cyar In
the same manner she would favour you with the number and names of the
footmen of the establishment and on a visit to Warwick Castle for this
bustling woman made one in every party of pleasure that was formed from
the hotel she gave us to understand that the great walk by the river
was altogether inferior to the principal avenue of Molloyville Park
I should not have been able to tell so much about Mrs Gam and her
daughter but that between ourselves I was particularly sweet upon a
young lady at the time whose papa lived at the Royal and was under
the care of Doctor Jephson

The Jemima appealed to by Mrs Gam in the above sentence was of course
her daughter apostrophised by her mother Jemima my souls darling
or Jemima my blessed child or Jemima my own love The
sacrifices that Mrs Gam had made for that daughter were she said
astonishing The money she had spent in masters upon her the illnesses
through which she had nursed her the ineffable love the mother bore
her were only known to Heaven Mrs Gam said They used to come into
the room with their arms round each others waists at dinner between
the courses the mother would sit with one hand locked in her daughters
and if only two or three young men were present at the time would be
pretty sure to kiss her Jemima more than once during the time whilst the
bohea was poured out

As for Miss Gam if she was not handsome candour forbids me to say she
was ugly She was neither one nor tother She was a person who wore
ringlets and a band round her forehead she knew four songs which
became rather tedious at the end of a couple of months acquaintance
she had excessively bare shoulders she inclined to wear numbers of
cheap ornaments rings brooches ferronnieres smellingbottles and
was always we thought very smartly dressed though old Mrs Lynx
hinted that her gowns and her mothers were turned over and over again
and that her eyes were almost put out by darning stockings

These eyes Miss Gam had very large though rather red and weak and used
to roll them about at every eligible unmarried man in the place But
though the widow subscribed to all the balls though she hired a fly
to go to the meet of the hounds though she was constant at church and
Jemima sang louder than any person there except the clerk and though
probably any person who made her a happy husband would be invited down
to enjoy the three footmen gardeners and carriages at Molloyville yet
no English gentleman was found sufficiently audacious to propose
Old Lynx used to say that the pair had been at Tunbridge Harrogate
Brighton Ramsgate Cheltenham for this eight years past where they
had met it seemed with no better fortune Indeed the widow looked
rather high for her blessed child and as she looked with the contempt
which no small number of Irish people feel upon all persons who get
their bread by labour or commerce and as she was a person whose
energetic manners costume and brogue were not much to the taste of
quiet English country gentlemen Jemimasweet spotless flowerstill
remained on her hands a thought withered perhaps and seedy

Now at this time the 120th Regiment was quartered at Weedon Barracks
and with the corps was a certain AssistantSurgeon Haggarty a large
lean tough rawboned man with big hands knockknees and carroty
whiskers and withal as honest a creature as ever handled a lancet
Haggarty as his name imports was of the very same nation as Mrs Gam
and what is more the honest fellow had some of the peculiarities which
belonged to the widow and bragged about his family almost as much as
she did I do not know of what particular part of Ireland they were
kings but monarchs they must have been as have been the ancestors of
so many thousand Hibernian families but they had been men of no small
consideration in Dublin where my father Haggarty said is as well
known as King Williams statue and where he rowls his carriage too
let me tell ye

Hence Haggarty was called by the wags Rowl the carriage and several
of them made inquiries of Mrs Gam regarding him Mrs Gam when you
used to go up from Molloyville to the Lord Lieutenants balls and had
your townhouse in Fitzwilliam Square used you to meet the famous Doctor
Haggarty in society

Is it Surgeon Haggarty of Gloucester Street ye mean The black Papist
Dye suppose that the Molloys would sit down to table with a creature of
that sort

Why isnt he the most famous physician in Dublin and doesnt he rowl
his carriage there

The horrid wretch He keeps a shop I tell ye and sends his sons out
with the medicine Hes got four of them off into the army Ulick and
Phil and Terence and Denny and now its Charles that takes out the
physic But how should I know about these odious creatures Their mother
was a Burke of Burkes Town county Cavan and brought Surgeon Haggarty
two thousand pounds She was a Protestant and I am surprised how she
could have taken up with a horrid odious Popish apothecary

From the extent of the widows information I am led to suppose that the
inhabitants of Dublin are not less anxious about their neighbours than
are the natives of English cities and I think it is very probable that
Mrs Gams account of the young Haggartys who carried out the medicine
is perfectly correct for a lad in the 120th made a caricature of
Haggarty coming out of a chemists shop with an oilcloth basket under
his arm which set the worthy surgeon in such a fury that there would
have been a duel between him and the ensign could the fiery doctor have
had his way

Now Dionysius Haggarty was of an exceedingly inflammable temperament
and it chanced that of all the invalids the visitors the young squires
of Warwickshire the young manufacturers from Birmingham the young
officers from the barracksit chanced unluckily for Miss Gam and
himself that he was the only individual who was in the least smitten
by her personal charms He was very tender and modest about his love
however for it must be owned that he respected Mrs Gam hugely and
fully admitted like a good simple fellow as he was the superiority of
that ladys birth and breeding to his own How could he hope that he a
humble assistantsurgeon with a thousand pounds his Aunt Kitty left
him for all his fortunehow could he hope that one of the race of
Molloyville would ever condescend to marry him

Inflamed however by love and inspired by wine one day at a picnic at
Kenilworth Haggarty whose love and raptures were the talk of the whole
regiment was induced by his waggish comrades to make a proposal in
form

Are you aware Mr Haggarty that you are speaking to a Molloy
was all the reply majestic Mrs Gam made when according to the usual
formula the fluttering Jemima referred her suitor to Mamma She left
him with a look which was meant to crush the poor fellow to earth she
gathered up her cloak and bonnet and precipitately called for her fly
She took care to tell every single soul in Leamington that the son of
the odious Papist apothecary had had the audacity to propose for her
daughter indeed a proposal coming from whatever quarter it may
does no harm and left Haggarty in a state of extreme depression and
despair

His downheartedness indeed surprised most of his acquaintances in and
out of the regiment for the young lady was no beauty and a doubtful
fortune and Dennis was a man outwardly of an unromantic turn who
seemed to have a great deal more liking for beefsteak and whiskypunch
than for women however fascinating

But there is no doubt this shy uncouth rough fellow had a warmer and
more faithful heart hid within him than many a dandy who is as handsome
as Apollo I for my part never can understand why a man falls in love
and heartily give him credit for so doing never mind with what or
whom THAT I take to be a point quite as much beyond an individuals own
control as the catching of the smallpox or the colour of his hair To
the surprise of all AssistantSurgeon Dionysius Haggarty was deeply and
seriously in love and I am told that one day he very nearly killed the
beforementioned young ensign with a carvingknife for venturing to
make a second caricature representing Lady Gammon and Jemima in a
fantastical park surrounded by three gardeners three carriages three
footmen and the covered cyar He would have no joking concerning them
He became moody and quarrelsome of habit He was for some time much more
in the surgery and hospital than in the mess He gave up the eating for
the most part of those vast quantities of beef and pudding for which
his stomach used to afford such ample and swift accommodation and when
the cloth was drawn instead of taking twelve tumblers and singing
Irish melodies as he used to do in a horrible cracked yelling voice
he would retire to his own apartment or gloomily pace the barrackyard
or madly whip and spur a grey mare he had on the road to Leamington
where his Jemima although invisible for him still dwelt

The season at Leamington coming to a conclusion by the withdrawal of the
young fellows who frequented that wateringplace the widow Gam retired
to her usual quarters for the other months of the year Where these
quarters were I think we have no right to ask for I believe she had
quarrelled with her brother at Molloyville and besides was a great
deal too proud to be a burden on anybody

Not only did the widow quit Leamington but very soon afterwards the
120th received its marching orders and left Weedon and Warwickshire
Haggartys appetite was by this time partially restored but his love
was not altered and his humour was still morose and gloomy I am
informed that at this period of his life he wrote some poems relative to
his unhappy passion a wild set of verses of several lengths and in
his handwriting being discovered upon a sheet of paper in which a
pitchplaster was wrapped up which Lieutenant and Adjutant Wheezer was
compelled to put on for a cold

Fancy then three years afterwards the surprise of all Haggartys
acquaintances on reading in the public papers the following
announcement

Married at Monkstown on the 12th instant Dionysius Haggarty Esq
of HM 120th Foot to Jemima Amelia Wilhelmina Molloy daughter of the
late Major Lancelot Gam RM and granddaughter of the late and niece
of the present Burke Bodkin Blake Molloy Esq Molloyville county
Mayo

Has the course of true love at last begun to run smooth thought I as
I laid down the paper and the old times and the old leering bragging
widow and the high shoulders of her daughter and the jolly days with
the 120th and Doctor Jephsons onehorse chaise and the Warwickshire
hunt andand Louisa S but never mind HERcame back to my mind
Has that goodnatured simple fellow at last met with his reward Well
if he has not to marry the motherinlaw too he may get on well enough

Another year announced the retirement of AssistantSurgeon Haggarty
from the 120th where he was replaced by AssistantSurgeon Angus
Rothsay Leech a Scotchman probably with whom I have not the least
acquaintance and who has nothing whatever to do with this little
history

Still more years passed on during which time I will not say that I kept
a constant watch upon the fortunes of Mr Haggarty and his lady for
perhaps if the truth were known I never thought for a moment about
them until one day being at Kingstown near Dublin dawdling on
the beach and staring at the Hill of Howth as most people at that
wateringplace do I saw coming towards me a tall gaunt man with a pair
of bushy red whiskers of which I thought I had seen the like in former
years and a face which could be no other than Haggartys It was
Haggarty ten years older than when we last met and greatly more grim
and thin He had on one shoulder a young gentleman in a dirty tartan
costume and a face exceedingly like his own peeping from under a
battered plume of black feathers while with his other hand he was
dragging a light green gocart in which reposed a female infant of some
two years old Both were roaring with great power of lungs

As soon as Dennis saw me his face lost the dull puzzled expression
which had seemed to characterise it he dropped the pole of the gocart
from one hand and his son from the other and came jumping forward to
greet me with all his might leaving his progeny roaring in the road

Bless my sowl says he sure its FitzBoodle Fitz dont you
remember me Dennis Haggarty of the 120th Leamington you know Molloy
my boy hould your tongue and stop your screeching and Jemimas too
dye hear Well it does good to sore eyes to see an old face How fat
youre grown Fitz and were ye ever in Ireland before and ant ye
delighted with it Confess now isnt it beautiful

This question regarding the merits of their country which I have
remarked is put by most Irish persons being answered in a satisfactory
manner and the shouts of the infants appeased from an applestall
hard by Dennis and I talked of old times I congratulated him on his
marriage with the lovely girl whom we all admired and hoped he had a
fortune with her and so forth His appearance however did not bespeak
a great fortune he had an old grey hat short old trousers an old
waistcoat with regimental buttons and patched Blucher boots such as
are not usually sported by persons in easy life

Ah says he with a sigh in reply to my queries times are changed
since them days FitzBoodle My wifes not what she wasthe beautiful
creature you knew her Molloy my boy run off in a hurry to your mamma
and tell her an English gentleman is coming home to dine for youll
dine with me Fitz in course And I agreed to partake of that meal
though Master Molloy altogether declined to obey his papas orders with
respect to announcing the stranger

Well I must announce you myself said Haggarty with a smile Come
its just dinnertime and my little cottage is not a hundred yards
off Accordingly we all marched in procession to Denniss little
cottage which was one of a row and a half of onestoried houses with
little courtyards before them and mostly with very fine names on the
doorposts of each Surgeon Haggarty was emblazoned on Denniss gate
on a stained green copperplate and not content with this on the
doorpost above the bell was an oval with the inscription of New
Molloyville The bell was broken of course the court or gardenpath
was mouldy weedy seedy there were some dirty rocks by way of
ornament round a faded glassplat in the centre some clothes and
rags hanging out of most part of the windows of New Molloyville the
immediate entrance to which was by a battered scraper under a broken
trelliswork up which a withered creeper declined any longer to climb

Small but snug says Haggarty Ill lead the way Fitz put your hat
on the flowerpot there and turn to the left into the drawingroom
A fog of onions and turfsmoke filled the whole of the house and gave
signs that dinner was not far off Far off You could hear it frizzling
in the kitchen where the maid was also endeavouring to hush the crying
of a third refractory child But as we entered all three of Haggartys
darlings were in full roar

Is it you Dennis cried a sharp raw voice from a dark corner in
the drawingroom to which we were introduced and in which a dirty
tablecloth was laid for dinner some bottles of porter and a cold
muttonbone being laid out on a rickety grand piano hard by Yere
always late Mr Haggarty Have you brought the whisky from Nowlans
Ill go bail yeve not now

My dear Ive brought an old friend of yours and mine to take potluck
with us today said Dennis

When is he to come said the lady At which speech I was rather
surprised for I stood before her

Here he is Jemima my love answered Dennis looking at me Mr
FitzBoodle dont you remember him in Warwickshire darling

Mr FitzBoodle I am very glad to see him said the lady rising and
curtseying with much cordiality

Mrs Haggarty was blind

Mrs Haggarty was not only blind but it was evident that smallpox
had been the cause of her loss of vision Her eyes were bound with a
bandage her features were entirely swollen scarred and distorted by
the horrible effects of the malady She had been knitting in a corner
when we entered and was wrapped in a very dirty bedgown Her voice to
me was quite different to that in which she addressed her husband She
spoke to Haggarty in broad Irish she addressed me in that most odious
of all languagesIrishEnglish endeavouring to the utmost to disguise
her brogue and to speak with the true dawdling distingue English air

Are you long in Ialand said the poor creature in this accent You
must faind it a sad babaous place Mr FitzBoodle Im shuah It was
vary kaind of you to come upon us en famille and accept a dinner sans
ceremonie Mr Haggarty I hope youll put the waine into aice Mr
FitzBoodle must be melted with this hot weathah

For some time she conducted the conversation in this polite strain and
I was obliged to say in reply to a query of hers that I did not find
her the least altered though I should never have recognised her but for
this rencontre She told Haggarty with a significant air to get the wine
from the cellah and whispered to me that he was his own butlah and the
poor fellow taking the hint scudded away into the town for a pound of
beefsteak and a couple of bottles of wine from the tavern

Will the childhren get their potatoes and butther here said a
barefoot girl with long black hair flowing over her face which she
thrust in at the door

Let them sup in the nursery Elizabeth and sendah Edwards to me

Is it cook you mane maam said the girl

Send her at once shrieked the unfortunate woman and the noise of
frying presently ceasing a hot woman made her appearance wiping her
brows with her apron and asking with an accent decidedly Hibernian
what the misthress wanted

Lead me up to my dressingroom Edwards I really am not fit to be seen
in this dishabille by Mr FitzBoodle

Fait I cant says Edwards sure the masthers at the butchers and
cant look to the kitchenfire

Nonsense I must go cried Mrs Haggarty and Edwards putting on a
resigned air and giving her arm and face a further rub with her apron
held out her arm to Mrs Dennis and the pair went upstairs

She left me to indulge my reflections for halfanhour at the end of
which period she came downstairs dressed in an old yellow satin with
the poor shoulders exposed just as much as ever She had mounted a
tawdry cap which Haggarty himself must have selected for her She had
all sorts of necklaces bracelets and earrings in gold in garnets
in motherofpearl in ormolu She brought in a furious savour of musk
which drove the odours of onions and turfsmoke before it and she
waved across her wretched angular mean scarred features an old cambric
handkerchief with a yellow laceborder

And so you would have known me anywhere Mr FitzBoodle said she
with a grin that was meant to be most fascinating I was sure you
would for though my dreadful illness deprived me of my sight it is a
mercy that it did not change my features or complexion at all

This mortification had been spared the unhappy woman but I dont
know whether with all her vanity her infernal pride folly and
selfishness it was charitable to leave her in her error

Yet why correct her There is a quality in certain people which is
above all advice exposure or correction Only let a man or woman have
DULNESS sufficient and they need bow to no extant authority A dullard
recognises no betters a dullard cant see that he is in the wrong
a dullard has no scruples of conscience no doubts of pleasing or
succeeding or doing right no qualms for other peoples feelings no
respect but for the fool himself How can you make a fool perceive he is
a fool Such a personage can no more see his own folly than he can see
his own ears And the great quality of Dulness is to be unalterably
contented with itself What myriads of souls are there of this admirable
sortselfish stingy ignorant passionate brutal bad sons mothers
fathers never known to do kind actions

To pause however in this disquisition which was carrying us far off
Kingstown New Molloyville Irelandnay into the wide world wherever
Dulness inhabitslet it be stated that Mrs Haggarty from my brief
acquaintance with her and her mother was of the order of persons just
mentioned There was an air of conscious merit about her very hard to
swallow along with the infamous dinner poor Dennis managed after
much delay to get on the table She did not fail to invite me to
Molloyville where she said her cousin would be charmed to see me and
she told me almost as many anecdotes about that place as her mother used
to impart in former days I observed moreover that Dennis cut her
the favourite pieces of the beefsteak that she ate thereof with great
gusto and that she drank with similar eagerness of the various strong
liquors at table We Irish ladies are all fond of a leetle glass of
punch she said with a playful air and Dennis mixed her a powerful
tumbler of such violent grog as I myself could swallow only with some
difficulty She talked of her suffering a great deal of her sacrifices
of the luxuries to which she had been accustomed before marriagein
a word of a hundred of those themes on which some ladies are in the
custom of enlarging when they wish to plague some husbands

But honest Dennis far from being angry at this perpetual wearisome
impudent recurrence to her own superiority rather encouraged the
conversation than otherwise It pleased him to hear his wife discourse
about her merits and family splendours He was so thoroughly beaten
down and henpecked that he as it were gloried in his servitude and
fancied that his wifes magnificence reflected credit on himself He
looked towards me who was half sick of the woman and her egotism as
if expecting me to exhibit the deepest sympathy and flung me glances
across the table as much as to say What a gifted creature my Jemima
is and what a fine fellow I am to be in possession of her When the
children came down she scolded them of course and dismissed them
abruptly for which circumstance perhaps the writer of these pages
was not in his heart very sorry and after having sat a preposterously
long time left us asking whether we would have coffee there or in her
boudoir

Oh here of course said Dennis with rather a troubled air and
in about ten minutes the lovely creature was led back to us again by
Edwards and the coffee made its appearance After coffee her husband
begged her to let Mr FitzBoodle hear her voice He longs for some of
his old favourites

No DO you said she and was led in triumph to the jingling old
piano and with a screechy wiry voice sang those very abominable old
ditties which I had heard her sing at Leamington ten years back

Haggarty as she sang flung himself back in the chair delighted
Husbands always are and with the same song one that they have heard
when they were nineteen years old probably most Englishmens tunes have
that date and it is rather affecting I think to hear an old gentleman
of sixty or seventy quavering the old ditty that was fresh when HE was
fresh and in his prime If he has a musical wife depend on it he thinks
her old songs of 1788 are better than any he has heard since in fact
he has heard NONE since When the old couple are in high goodhumour the
old gentleman will take the old lady round the waist and say My dear
do sing me one of your own songs and she sits down and sings with her
old voice and as she sings the roses of her youth bloom again for a
moment Ranelagh resuscitates and she is dancing a minuet in powder and
a train

This is another digression It was occasioned by looking at poor
Denniss face while his wife was screeching and believe me the former
was the more pleasant occupation Bottom tickled by the fairies could
not have been in greater ecstasies He thought the music was divine
and had further reason for exulting in it which was that his wife was
always in a good humour after singing and never would sing but in that
happy frame of mind Dennis had hinted so much in our little colloquy
during the ten minutes of his ladys absence in the boudoir so at
the conclusion of each piece we shouted Bravo and clapped our hands
like mad

Such was my insight into the life of Surgeon Dionysius Haggarty and his
wife and I must have come upon him at a favourable moment too for poor
Dennis has spoken subsequently of our delightful evening at Kingstown
and evidently thinks to this day that his friend was fascinated by
the entertainment there His inward economy was as follows he had his
halfpay a thousand pounds about a hundred a year that his father
left and his wife had sixty pounds a year from the mother which the
mother of course never paid He had no practice for he was absorbed
in attention to his Jemima and the children whom he used to wash to
dress to carry out to walk or to ride as we have seen and who
could not have a servant as their dear blind mother could never be left
alone Mrs Haggarty a great invalid used to lie in bed till one and
have breakfast and hot luncheon there A fifth part of his income was
spent in having her wheeled about in a chair by which it was his duty
to walk daily for an allotted number of hours Dinner would ensue and
the amateur clergy who abound in Ireland and of whom Mrs Haggarty
was a great admirer lauded her everywhere as a model of resignation and
virtue and praised beyond measure the admirable piety with which she
bore her sufferings

Well every man to his taste It did not certainly appear to me that SHE
was the martyr of the family

The circumstances of my marriage with Jemima Dennis said to me in
some after conversations we had on this interesting subject were the
most romantic and touching you can conceive You saw what an impression
the dear girl had made upon me when we were at Weedon for from the
first day I set eyes on her and heard her sing her delightful song of
Darkeyed Maiden of Araby I felt and said to Turniquet of ours that
very night that SHE was the darkeyed maid of Araby for MEnot that
she was you know for she was born in Shropshire But I felt that I had
seen the woman who was to make me happy or miserable for life You know
how I proposed for her at Kenilworth and how I was rejected and how I
almost shot myself in consequenceno you dont know that for I said
nothing about it to anyone but I can tell you it was a very near thing
and a very lucky thing for me I didnt do it forwould you believe
itthe dear girl was in love with me all the time

Was she really said I who recollected that Miss Gams love of those
days showed itself in a very singular manner but the fact is when
women are most in love they most disguise it

Over head and ears in love with poor Dennis resumed that worthy
fellow whod ever have thought it But I have it from the best
authority from her own mother with whom Im not over and above good
friends now but of this fact she assured me and Ill tell you when and
how

We were quartered at Cork three years after we were at Weedon and it
was our last year at home and a great mercy that my dear girl spoke
in time or where should we have been now Well one day marching
home from parade I saw a lady seated at an open window by another who
seemed an invalid and the lady at the window who was dressed in the
profoundest mourning cried out with a scream Gracious heavens its
Mr Haggarty of the 120th

Sure I know that voice says I to Whiskerton

Its a great mercy you dont know it a deal too well says he its
Lady Gammon Shes on some husbandhunting scheme depend on it for
that daughter of hers She was at Bath last year on the same errand and
at Cheltenham the year before where Heaven bless you shes as well
known as the Hen and Chickens

Ill thank you not to speak disrespectfully of Miss Jemima Gam said
I to Whiskerton shes of one of the first families in Ireland and
whoever says a word against a woman I once proposed for insults medo
you understand

Well marry her if you like says Whiskerton quite peevish marry
her and be hanged

Marry her the very idea of it set my brain awhirling and made me a
thousand times more mad than I am by nature

You may be sure I walked up the hill to the paradeground that
afternoon and with a beating heart too I came to the widows house It
was called New Molloyville as this is Wherever she takes a house for
six months she calls it New Molloyville and has had one in Mallow
in Bandon in Sligo in Castlebar in Fermoy in Drogheda and the deuce
knows where besides but the blinds were down and though I thought I
saw somebody behind em no notice was taken of poor Denny Haggarty
and I paced up and down all messtime in hopes of catching a glimpse of
Jemima but in vain The next day I was on the ground again I was just
as much in love as ever thats the fact Id never been in that way
before look you and when once caught I knew it was for life

Theres no use in telling you how long I beat about the bush but when
I DID get admittance to the house it was through the means of young
Castlereagh Molloy whom you may remember at Leamington and who was
at Cork for the regatta and used to dine at our mess and had taken a
mighty fancy to mewhen I DID get into the house I say I rushed in
medias res at once I couldnt keep myself quiet my heart was too full

Oh Fitz I shall never forget the daythe moment I was inthrojuiced
into the dthrawingroom as he began to be agitated Denniss brogue
broke out with greater richness than ever but though a stranger may
catch and repeat from memory a few words it is next to impossible for
him to KEEP UP A CONVERSATION in Irish so that we had best give up all
attempts to imitate Dennis When I saw old mother Gam said he my
feelings overcame me all at once I rowled down on the ground sir as
if Id been hit by a musketball Dearest madam says I Ill die if
you dont give me Jemima

Heavens Mr Haggarty says she how you seize me with surprise
Castlereagh my dear nephew had you not better leave us and away he
went lighting a cigar and leaving me still on the floor

Rise Mr Haggarty continued the widow I will not attempt to deny
that this constancy towards my daughter is extremely affecting however
sudden your present appeal may be I will not attempt to deny that
perhaps Jemima may have a similar feeling but as I said I never
could give my daughter to a Catholic

Im as good a Protestant as yourself maam says I my mother was
an heiress and we were all brought up her way

That makes the matter very different says she turning up the whites
of her eyes How could I ever have reconciled it to my conscience to
see my blessed child married to a Papist How could I ever have taken
him to Molloyville Well this obstacle being removed _I_ must put
myself no longer in the way between two young people _I_ must sacrifice
myself as I always have when my darling girl was in question YOU shall
see her the poor dear lovely gentle sufferer and learn your fate from
her own lips

The sufferer maam says I has Miss Gam been ill

What havent you heard cried the widow Havent you heard of the
dreadful illness which so nearly carried her from me For nine weeks
Mr Haggarty I watched her day and night without taking a wink of
sleepfor nine weeks she lay trembling between death and life and I
paid the doctor eightythree guineas She is restored now but she is
the wreck of the beautiful creature she was Suffering and perhaps
ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENTbut we wont mention that NOWhave so pulled
her down But I will leave you and prepare my sweet girl for this
strange this entirely unexpected visit

I wont tell you what took place between me and Jemima to whom I was
introduced as she sat in the darkened room poor sufferer nor describe
to you with what a thrill of joy I seized after groping about for it
her poor emaciated hand She did not withdraw it I came out of that
room an engaged man sir and NOW I was enabled to show her that I had
always loved her sincerely for there was my will made three years
back in her favour that night she refused me as I told ye I would
have shot myself but theyd have brought me in non compos and my
brother Mick would have contested the will and so I determined to live
in order that she might benefit by my dying I had but a thousand pounds
then since that my father has left me two more I willed every shilling
to her as you may fancy and settled it upon her when we married as we
did soon after It was not for some time that I was allowed to see
the poor girls face or indeed was aware of the horrid loss she had
sustained Fancy my agony my dear fellow when I saw that beautiful
wreck

There was something not a little affecting to think in the conduct of
this brave fellow that he never once as he told his story seemed to
allude to the possibility of his declining to marry a woman who was not
the same as the woman he loved but that he was quite as faithful to
her now as he had been when captivated by the poor tawdry charms of the
silly Miss of Leamington It was hard that such a noble heart as this
should be flung away upon yonder foul mass of greedy vanity Was it
hard or not that he should remain deceived in his obstinate humility
and continue to admire the selfish silly being whom he had chosen to
worship

I should have been appointed surgeon of the regiment continued
Dennis soon after when it was ordered abroad to Jamaica where it now
is But my wife would not hear of going and said she would break her
heart if she left her mother So I retired on halfpay and took this
cottage and in case any practice should fall in my waywhy there is
my name on the brass plate and Im ready for anything that comes But
the only case that ever DID come was one day when I was driving my wife
in the chaise and another one night of a beggar with a broken head
My wife makes me a present of a baby every year and weve no debts and
between you and me and the post as long as my motherinlaw is out of
the house Im as happy as I need be

What you and the old lady dont get on well said I

I cant say we do its not in nature you know said Dennis with a
faint grin She comes into the house and turns it topsyturvy When
shes here Im obliged to sleep in the scullery Shes never paid her
daughters income since the first year though she brags about her
sacrifices as if she had ruined herself for Jemima and besides when
shes here theres a whole clan of the Molloys horse foot and
dragoons that are quartered upon us and eat me out of house and home

And is Molloyville such a fine place as the widow described it asked
I laughing and not a little curious

Oh a mighty fine place entirely said Dennis Theres the oak park
of two hundred acres the finest land ye ever saw only theyve cut all
the wood down The garden in the old Molloys time they say was the
finest ever seen in the West of Ireland but theyve taken all the glass
to mend the house windows and small blame to them either Theres a
clear rentroll of thirtyfive hundred a year only its in the hand of
receivers besides other debts for which there is no land security

Your cousininlaw Castlereagh Molloy wont come into a large
fortune

Oh hell do very well said Dennis As long as he can get credit
hes not the fellow to stint himself Faith I was fool enough to put my
name to a bit of paper for him and as they could not catch him in Mayo
they laid hold of me at Kingstown here And there was a pretty to do
Didnt Mrs Gam say I was ruining her family thats all I paid it by
instalments for all my money is settled on Jemima and Castlereagh
whos an honourable fellow offered me any satisfaction in life Anyhow
he couldnt do more than THAT

Of course not and now youre friends

Yes and he and his aunt have had a tiff too and he abuses her
properly I warrant ye He says that she carried about Jemima from place
to place and flung her at the head of every unmarried man in England
amostmy poor Jemima and she all the while dying in love with me
As soon as she got over the smallpoxshe took it at FermoyGod bless
her I wish Id been by to be her nursetenderas soon as she was
rid of it the old lady said to Castlereagh Castlereagh go to the
barcks and find out in the Army List where the 120th is Off she came
to Cork hot foot It appears that while she was ill Jemimas love for
me showed itself in such a violent way that her mother was overcome and
promised that should the dear child recover she would try and bring us
together Castlereagh says she would have gone after us to Jamaica

I have no doubt she would said I

Could you have a stronger proof of love than that cried Dennis My
dear girls illness and frightful blindness have of course injured her
health and her temper She cannot in her position look to the children
you know and so they come under my charge for the most part and her
temper is unequal certainly But you see what a sensitive refined
elegant creature she is and may fancy that shes often put out by a
rough fellow like me

Here Dennis left me saying it was time to go and walk out the children
and I think his story has matter of some wholesome reflection in it for
bachelors who are about to change their condition or may console some
who are mourning their celibacy Marry gentlemen if you like leave
your comfortable dinner at the club for coldmutton and curlpapers at
your home give up your books or pleasures and take to yourselves wives
and children but think well on what you do first as I have no doubt
you will after this advice and example Advice is always useful in
matters of love men always take it they always follow other peoples
opinions not their own they always profit by example When they see a
pretty woman and feel the delicious madness of love coming over them
they always stop to calculate her temper her money their own money
or suitableness for the married life Ha ha ha Let us fool in this
way no more I have been in love fortythree times with all ranks and
conditions of women and would have married every time if they would
have let me How many wives had King Solomon the wisest of men And is
not that story a warning to us that Love is master of the wisest It is
only fools who defy him

I must come however to the last and perhaps the saddest part of poor
Denny Haggartys history I met him once more and in such a condition
as made me determine to write this history

In the month of June last I happened to be at Richmond a delightful
little place of retreat and there sunning himself upon the terrace
was my old friend of the 120th he looked older thinner poorer
and more wretched than I had ever seen him What you have given up
Kingstown said I shaking him by the hand

Yes says he

And is my lady and your family here at Richmond

No says he with a sad shake of the head and the poor fellows
hollow eyes filled with tears

Good heavens Denny whats the matter said I He was squeezing my
hand like a vice as I spoke

Theyve LEFT me he burst out with a dreadful shout of passionate
griefa horrible scream which seemed to be wrenched out of his heart
Left me said he sinking down on a seat and clenching his great
fists and shaking his lean arms wildly Im a wise man now Mr
FitzBoodle Jemima has gone away from me and yet you know how I loved
her and how happy we were Ive got nobody now but Ill die soon
thats one comfort and to think its she thatll kill me after all

The story which he told with a wild and furious lamentation such as is
not known among men of our cooler country and such as I dont like now
to recall was a very simple one The motherinlaw had taken possession
of the house and had driven him from it His property at his marriage
was settled on his wife She had never loved him and told him this
secret at last and drove him out of doors with her selfish scorn and
illtemper The boy had died the girls were better he said brought up
among the Molloys than they could be with him and so he was quite alone
in the world and was living or rather dying on forty pounds a year

His troubles are very likely over by this time The two fools who caused
his misery will never read this history of him THEY never read godless
stories in magazines and I wish honest reader that you and I went to
church as much as they do These people are not wicked BECAUSE of
their religious observances but IN SPITE of them They are too dull to
understand humility too blind to see a tender and simple heart under
a rough ungainly bosom They are sure that all their conduct towards my
poor friend here has been perfectly righteous and that they have given
proofs of the most Christian virtue Haggartys wife is considered by
her friends as a martyr to a savage husband and her mother is the angel
that has come to rescue her All they did was to cheat him and desert
him And safe in that wonderful selfcomplacency with which the fools
of this earth are endowed they have not a single pang of conscience for
their villany towards him consider their heartlessness as a proof and
consequence of their spotless piety and virtue




FOOTNOTES

Footnote 1 The words of this song are copyright nor will the
copyright be sold for less than twopencehalfpenny

Footnote 2 A French proverbe furnished the author with the notion of
the rivalry between the Barber and the Tailor

Footnote 3 As it is very probable that many fair readers may not
approve of the extremely forcible language in which the combat is
depicted I beg them to skip it and pass on to the next chapter and to
remember that it has been modelled on the style of the very best writers
of the sporting papers

Footnote 4 Every person who has lived abroad can of course point out
a score of honourable exceptions to the case above hinted at and knows
many such unions in which it is the Frenchman who honours the English
lady by marrying her But it must be remembered that marrying in France
means commonly fortunehunting and as for the respect in which marriage
is held in France let all the French novels in M Rolandis library be
perused by those who wish to come to a decision upon the question
