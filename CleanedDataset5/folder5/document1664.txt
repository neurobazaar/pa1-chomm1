SONGS OF DESIRE




Summer Explorer


 Id like to be a gypsy
 With gold rings in my ears
 Along the road to sit and sing
 And not do another thing
 For years and years

 A road to dream upon by day
 A fire for dreams at night
 Free to wander far away
 Free to shout and free to play
 Quite impolite

 Id pitch my tent beside a wall
 All apple trees within
 And if the apples didnt fall
 I wouldnt hesitate at all
 Id climband sin

 But if the weather wasnt fine
 If all the world were rain
 If there werent anywhere to dine
 And gooseflesh quivered up my spine
 I _might_ come home again




Spring Wish


 A frogs a very happy thing
 Cool and green in early spring
 Quick and silver through the pool
 With no thought of books or school

 Oh I want to be a frog
 Sunning stretching on a log
 Blinking there in splendid ease
 Swimming naked when I please
 Nosing into magic nooks
 Quiet marshes noisy brooks

 Free And fit for anything
 Oh to be a frog in spring




Ambition


 If I were a rocket
 Shot high across the night
 Id rather burst in silver stars
 Than green or purple light

 For then perhaps Id fool the moon
 Although shes very wise
 And thinking me a baby star
 Shed keep me in the skies




Dreams


 Id like to dream my own dreams
 Instead of dreaming those
 The silly sandman brings along
 Like moving picture shows

 Id like to dream of palaces
 Of magic meadowlands
 Of silver gates and golden thrones
 And chanting fairy bands

 Of seas of spraying jewels
 Of dancing crystal ships
 Of the queen of all the elves herself
 Two rubies for her lips

 But alas I never dream such things
 And when I jump and wake
 As an oozy ogre clutches me
 Its just a stomach ache




WaterLily


 Id like to be a waterlily sleeping on the river
 Where solemn rushes whisper and funny ripples quiver
 All day Id watch the blue skyall night Id watch the black
 Floating in the soft waves dreaming on my back
 And when Id tired of dreaming Id call a passing fish
 I want to find the sea Id shout Come You can grant my wish

 Hed bite me from my moorings and softly I would slip
 To the center of the river like an oceangoing ship
 The waves would laugh upon me The wind would blow me fast
 And oh what shores and wonders would greet me as I passed
 Yes if I were a waterlily Id sail to sea in state
 A green frog for my captainand a dragonfly for mate




Humor


 Have you ever watched the clowns at play
 White red and black on circus day
 Theyre always very very gay
 I wonder how they stay that way

 Id like to be a clown
 Playing tricks around the town
 Turning somersaults and springs
 As if they were easy things
 Laughing morning noon and night
 Being such a funny sight

 Do you think then Id grow tired of fun
 Laughing so from sun to sun
 Or when performances are done
 Do clownfolk cry like anyone




Independence


 I like to go out in the night
 When theres neither a sound nor a light
 With my hands and feet bare
 And the wind in my hair
 Not a nurse nor a parent in sight

 But only the night moon and me
 As I dance in the dew joyfully
 Quite daring and bold
 For theres no one to scold
 Because there is no one to see




SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS




A Comparison


 Apple blossoms look like snow
 Theyre different though
 Snow falls softly but it brings
 Noisy things
 Sleighs and bells forts and fights
 Cosy nights

 But apple blossoms when they go
 White and slow
 Quiet all the orchard space
 Till the place
 Hushed with falling sweetness seems
 Filled with dreams




Speculation


 I wonder if God sits alone
 Upon the highest mountain stone
 To stir the clouds and drop the rain
 And then to pick it up again

 I wonder if he sends the brooks
 Foaming from their distant nooks
 And sitting there in robes of gray
 Turns rivers on at break of day




Parade


 The scarlet trumpet flowers are gay
 And yet they never seem to play
 They never trumpet up the dawn
 Nor blow retreat across the lawn

 But oh today I heard a strain
 A happy martial quick refrain
 As down across the garden grass
 I saw the marching flowers pass

 Gaudy phlox and flaunting rose
 Stiff and straight and on their toes
 And blaring from the garden wall
 The trumpet flower led them all




Flower Preferences


 If I were a tiny fairy
 With nothing else to do
 But to wriggle into flowers
 All the long day through

 Id dance among the roses
 Id take a stately walk
 Balancing precisely
 On an Easterlily stalk

 For play Id choose the jonquils
 For swimming poppy cups
 For jokes and tricks and tiny naps
 The Johnnyjumpups

 But on some quiet evening
 Id leave my fairy band
 And on a starflower through the sky
 Id sail to fairyland




Parental Advice


 Who laid the egg that hatched the moon
 Was it the earth I wonder
 Was it the sun the clouds or rain
 Was it night or thunder

 If I were mother to the moon
 Id spank her every day
 Until she learned to stay at home
 And _never_ run away




Song for a Child Watching Clouds


 Ive watched the clouds by day and night
 Great fleecy ones all filled with light
 Gray beasts that steal across the sky
 And little fellows slipping by

 Sometimes they seem like sheep at play
 Sometimes when they are dull and gray
 The pale sun seems a ship to me
 Sailing through a rolling sea

 And Ive seen faces in them too
 Funny white men on the blue
 They look so many different ways
 And not one single cloudlet stays

 But on across the heavens they blow
 I often wonder where they go
 Now sometime maybe when I die
 I too will wander through the sky




Problem


 If I were a violet Id think it a shame
 To be always so simple and modest and tame
 To be hidden away like a hermit or nun
 While the harebrained pink roses can dance in the sun
 But consider the naughty wild ways of the rose
 There _must_ be _respectable_ flowers I suppose




Garden Musings


 Why is the lily so stately and still
 Why doesnt she dance like the gay daffodil
 Why doesnt she blush like the rose or the pink
 Or like mischievous pansy indulge in a wink
 Do you think its because she is holier than they
 Or did God just decide he would make her that way




My Garden


 My garden was silly and stubborn
 I worked but the weeds worked too
 I dug and scraped and scrambled
 They hustled themselves and grew

 Now Teds gardens fine and cleanly
 He has lettuce and roses and peas
 Oh most probably plants are like children
 They only behave when they please




Tracks


 I wonder where the rabbits go
 Who leave their tracks across the snow
 For when I follow to their den
 The tracks always start out again




Chanticleer


 High and proud on the barnyard fence
 Walks rooster in the morning
 He shakes his comb he shakes his tail
 And gives his daily warning

 Get up you lazy boys and girls
 Its time you should be dressing
 I wonder if he keeps a clock
 Or if hes only guessing




Rainbow


 The rainbow comes across the hill
 It shines upon the sky until
 It frightens all the tears from rain
 And then it hides itself again

 Now when Im very tired of play
 Ill cross that rainbow bridge some day
 And while dear nurse and father scold
 Ill reach the endand find the gold




Windmill


 The windmill stands up like a flower on the hill
 With its petals awhirlingthey seldom stay still
 And its funny old voice creaking all the long day
 As it scolds little breezes for running away




CatFish


 The catfish with whiskers that lives in the brook
 Is an ugly old beast with the wickedest look
 I suppose there were mousefish one time in brook town
 Till that ugly old catfish gulped all of them down




Visiting


 You and I shall travel far
 Well pass the old earth by
 Well ride the moon and drive a star
 Across the evening sky

 Well flash upon the milky way
 To pay Dame Night a call
 But should we happen on old Day
 Wed fall and fall and fall




Castles


 I used to build me castles of moisty sand and shells
 And dream they were for princesses who wove me magic spells
 But yesterday along the beach my fairy princess came
 And shes too big for castlesnow isnt that a shame




Parenthood


 The birches that dance on the top of the hill
 Are so slender and young that they cannot keep still
 They bend and they nod at each whiff of a breeze
 For you see they are still just the children of trees

 But the birches below in the valley are older
 They are calmer and straighter and taller and colder
 Perhaps when weve grown up as solemn and grave
 We too will have children who do not behave






SONGS OF CIRCUMSTANCE





Moral Song


 Oh so cool
 In his deep green pool
 Was a frog on a log one day
 He would blink his eyes
 As he snapped at flies
 For his mother was away
 _For his mother was away_

 Now that naughty frog
 Left his own home log
 And started out to play
 He flipped and he flopped
 And he never stopped
 Till he reached the great blue bay
 _Till he reached the great blue bay_

 Alas with a swish
 Came a mighty fish
 And swallowed him where he lay
 Now its things like this
 That never miss
 Little frogs who dont obey
 _Little frogs who dont obey_




Serious Omission


 I know that there are dragons
 St Georges Jasons too
 And many modern dragons
 With scales of green and blue

 But though Ive been there many times
 And carefully looked through
 I cant find a dragon
 In the cages at the zoo




Choice


 If I had just one penny
 On the Fourth of July
 Oh what a problem it would be
 To think what I should buy

 With lollypops and fireworks
 With cakes and whizbangs too
 With tops and candy cigarettes
 Whatever should I do

 Torpedoes have a splendid noise
 But noise is quickly past
 And the sweetness of a lollypop
 Is something that will last




Natural Fireworks


 The fireflies in the valley
 Are having their display
 Among the river willows
 Like little bits of day

 Come light your silver sparkler
 And wave it in the air
 Go dance among the willows
 And sprinkle sparkles there

 Then oh the world will wonder
 To see the willows shine
 And even the fireflies will not know
 Their tiny sparks from mine




Conspiracy


 The sun has a face that is laughing and red
 When nurse pulls me out in the morning from bed
 But hes not half so sly as the silly old moon
 Who winks when Im sent to my bedroom too soon




Cuckoo Clock


 The cuckoo in the clock by day
 Is usually very gay
 And thats because with people near
 Theres not a thing for him to fear

 But when the sitting room is dim
 And no ones there to welcome him
 How tremblingly he must come out
 To flap his wings and look about

 Why Only just the other night
 The cuckoo stopped the clock from fright




The Sentinel


 Im only a little toy doughboy
 And I have neither sorrows nor fears
 But I patiently wait
 With my gun pointed straight
 And my helmet pulled down on my ears

 The ugly wood lions and tigers
 May show their white teeth if they please
 If the whole Noahs ark
 Should threaten and bark
 It wouldnt unstiffen my knees

 And some day when you are a soldier
 With your helmet pulled down on your ears
 Ill still be as straight
 As I wonder and wait
 Standing my watch through the years




Royalty


 If I should meet a king or queen
 Upon the street some day
 Do you think that Id be frightened
 Why Id know just what to say

 Your reverend majesties Id say
 And humbly bow the knee
 I am your very humble swain
 And will you honor me

 The king would strike my shoulder
 With a sword of passing might
 Hed lift me grandly to my feet
 Hed say Arise O Knight

 Oh I would not be frightened
 For Ive seen kings galore
 Dont you think its just to learn of them
 That playing cards are for




Crackers


 Oh there are very many kinds
 Of crackers great and small
 Saltines and gingersnaps and such
 Id like to eat them all

 But theres a kind of cracker
 That I _need much worse_
 A bright red giant cracker
 To set off under nurse




The Drum


 The drums a very quiet fellow
 When hes left alone
 But oh how he does roar and bellow
 Rattle snap and groan
 Clatter spatter dash and patter
 Rumble shriek and moan
 Wheneer I take my sticks in hand
 And beat him soundly for the band




Theatricals


 Now Ill play at being queen
 Hold my head quite stiff and haughty
 Always proud and never naughty
 Sweeping grandly down the green

 Or Ill be a moonlight fairy
 Bobbing lightly on the river
 Dancing where the shadows quiver
 Winged and shining swift and wary

 If the doctor thinks Im sick
 Hes just silly _I am not_
 Im just tired and very hot
 Hating drink thats sweet and thick

 Flowers dance across the walls
 Mothers face seems far away
 Shes the audience Im the play
 She will clap for curtain calls

 NoI do not want to play
 Seven thrones around my bed
 Circling gold about my head
 Angels always fly away




Sally


 If I were a stately sailboat
 Id sail to Zanzibar
 Id sail the seven secret seas
 Where the secret cities are
 And some day Id be sailing with the wind before my prow
 And all the mermaids of the sea would clamber up the bow
 Theyd beckon me with laughter
 Theyd beckon me with smiles
 Theyd show me cakes and candies
 In half a dozen styles
 Theyd promise me a life of ease
 Eating sweets beneath the seas
 Theyd promise me a life of play
 A never ending holiday
 But I would say quite plainly
 And oh how stern Id look
 Do you think that you can tempt me
 While Sally is our cook

 If I were a little fire balloon
 Id float aloft to Mars
 Id pay a call on Venus
 And chatter with the stars
 And just as Id be fluttering across the yellow moon
 The angels would come singing a solemn Sunday tune
 Theyd beckon to me gravely
 Theyd tell me I could stay
 Theyd show me all the jewels
 That pave the milky way
 Theyd promise me a golden crown
 And silver robes like eiderdown
 Theyd give me harps with shiny strings
 And wonderfully fluffy wings
 BUTI would tell them plainly
 I didnt want to die
 Till all the angel cooks had learned
 How Sally makes mince pie




SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE




Bundles


 A bundle is a funny thing
 It always sets me wondering
 For whether it is thin or wide
 You never know just whats inside

 Especially on Christmas week
 Temptation is so great to peek
 Now wouldnt it be much more fun
 If shoppers carried things undone




The Candy Santa Claus


 Im very fond of candles
 With their quaint coquettish way
 But alas I wooed too often
 And now my lifes to pay

 They knew I was important
 When they decked the Christmas tree
 Yes they hung me on the tiptop
 For all the world to see

 But alas A lady candle
 Has come with me to the top
 And Im melting with affection
 Im dying drop by drop




The Tinsel Star


 Im just a shiny tinsel star
 Boxed all the time as such things are
 And only used just once a year
 Oh life is very dull and drear

 A real star has far fields to roam
 A tinsel star must stay at home
 It is a terrible vexation
 To be a silly imitation




The Ambitious Mouse


 If all the world were candy
 And the sky were frosted cake
 Oh it would be a splendid job
 For a mouse to undertake

 To eat a path of sweetmeats
 Through candy forest aisles
 Explore the land of Peppermint
 Stretched out for miles and miles

 To gobble up a cloudlet
 A little cupcake star
 To swim a lake of liquid sweet
 With shores of chocolate bar

 But best of all the eating
 Would be the toothsome fat
 Triumphant hour of mousedesire
 To eat a candy cat




Prayer


 Last night I crept across the snow
 Where only tracking rabbits go
 And then I waited quite alone
 Until the Christmas radiance shone

 At midnight twenty angels came
 Each white and shining like a flame
 At midnight twenty angels sang
 The stars swung out like bells and rang

 They lifted me across the hill
 They bore me in their arms until
 A greater glory greeted them
 It was the town of Bethlehem

 And gently then they set me down
 All worshipping that holy town
 And gently then they bade me raise
 My head to worship and to praise

 And gently then the Christ smiled down
 Ah there was glory in that town
 It was as if the world were free
 And glistening with purity

 And in that vault of crystal blue
 It was as if the world were new
 And myriad angels file on file
 Glorified in the Christchilds smile

 It was so beautiful to see
 Such glory for a child like me
 So beautiful it does not seem
 It could have been a Christmas dream

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
