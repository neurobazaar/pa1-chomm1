CHAPTER I

BILLY WRITES A LETTER



Billy Neilson was eighteen years old when the aunt who had brought her
up from babyhood died Miss Bentons death left Billy quite alone
in the worldalone and peculiarly forlorn To Mr James Harding
of Harding  Harding who had charge of Billys not inconsiderable
property the girl poured out her heart in all its loneliness two days
after the funeral

You see Mr Harding there isnt any onenot any one whocares she
choked

Tut tut my child its not so bad as that surely remonstrated the
old man gently Why II care

Billy smiled through tearwet eyes

But I cant LIVE with you she said

Im not so sure of that either retorted the man Im thinking that
Letty and Ann would LIKE to have you with us

The girl laughed now outright She was thinking of Miss Letty who had
nerves and of Miss Ann who had a heart and she pictured her own
young breezy healthy self attempting to conform to the hushed and
shaded thing that life was within Lawyer Hardings home

Thank you but Im sure they wouldnt she objected You dont know
how noisy I am

The lawyer stirred restlessly and pondered

But surely my dear isnt there some relative somewhere he
demanded How about your mothers people

Billy shook her head Her eyes filled again with tears

There was only Aunt Ella ever that I knew anything about She and
mother were the only children there were and mother died when I was a
year old you know

But your fathers people

Its even worse there He was an only child and an orphan when mother
married him He died when I was but six months old After that there was
only mother and Aunt Ella then Aunt Ella alone and nowno one

And you know nothing of your fathers people

Nothing that isalmost nothing

Then there is some one

Billy smiled A deeper pink showed in her cheeks

Why theres onea man but he isnt really fathers people anyway
But II have been tempted to write to him

Who is he

The one Im named for He was fathers boyhood chum You see thats why
Im Billy instead of being a proper Susie or Bessie or Sally
Jane Father had made up his mind to name his baby William after his
chum and when I came Aunt Ella said he was quite brokenhearted until
somebody hit upon the idea of naming me Billy Then he was content for
it seems that he always called his chum Billy anyhow And soBilly
I am today

Do you know this man

No You see father died and mother and Aunt Ella knew him only very
slightly Mother knew his wife though Aunt Ella said and SHE was
lovely

Hm well we might look them up perhaps You know his address

Oh yes unless hes moved Weve always kept that Aunt Ella used to
say sometimes that she was going to write to him some day about me you
know

Whats his name

William Henshaw He lives in Boston

Lawyer Harding snatched off his glasses and leaned forward in his
chair

William Henshaw Not the Beacon Street Henshaws he cried

It was Billys turn to be excited She too leaned forward eagerly

Oh do you know him Thats lovely And his address IS Beacon Street I
know because I saw it only today You see I HAVE been tempted to write
him

Write him Of course youll write him cried the lawyer And we dont
need to do much looking up there child Ive known the family for
years and this William was a college mate of my boys Nice fellow
too Ive heard Ned speak of him There were three sons William and
two others much younger than he Ive forgotten their names

Then you do know him Im so glad exclaimed Billy You see he never
seemed to me quite real

I know about him corrected the lawyer smilingly though Ill
confess Ive rather lost track of him lately Ned will know Ill ask
Ned Now go home my dear and dry those pretty eyes of yours Or
better still come home with me to tea IIll telephone up to the
house And he rose stiffly and went into the inner office

Some minutes passed before he came back red of face and plainly
distressed

My dear child IIm sorry butbut Ill have to take back that
invitation he blurted out miserably My sisters areare not well
this afternoon Ann has been having a turn with her heartyou know
Anns heart isis bad and LettyLetty is always nervous at such
timesvery nervous ErIm so sorry But youllexcuse it

Indeed I will smiled Billy and thank you just the same onlyher
eyes twinkled mischievouslyyou dont mind if I do say that it IS
lucky that we hadnt gone on planning to have me live with them Mr
Harding

Eh Weller I think your plan about the Henshaws is very good
he interposed hurriedly Ill speak to NedIll speak to Ned he
finished as he ceremoniously bowed the girl from the office

James Harding kept his word and spoke to his son that night but there
was little after all that Ned could tell him Yes he remembered Billy
Henshaw well but he had not heard of him for years since Henshaws
marriage in fact He must be forty years old Ned said but he was a
fine fellow an exceptionally fine fellow and would be sure to deal
kindly and wisely by his little orphan namesake of that Ned was very
sure

Thats good Ill write him declared Mr James Harding Ill write
him tomorrow

He did writebut not so soon as Billy wrote for even as he spoke
Billy in her lonely little room at the other end of the town was
laying bare all her homesickness in four long pages to Dear Uncle
William



CHAPTER II

THE STRATA


Bertram Henshaw called the Beacon Street home The Strata This annoyed
Cyril and even William not a little though they reflected that after
all it was only Bertram For the whole of Bertrams twentyfour years
of life it had been like thisIts only Bertram had been at once the
curse and the salvation of his existence

In this particular case however Bertrams vagary of fancy had some
excuse The Beacon Street house the home of the three brothers was a
Strata

You see its like this Bertram would explain airily to some new
acquaintance who expressed surprise at the name if I could slice off
the front of the house like a loaf of cake youd understand it better
But just suppose that old Bunker Hill should suddenly spout fire and
brimstone and bury us under tons of ashesonly fancy the condition of
mind of those future archaeologists when they struck our house after
their months of digging

What would they find Listen First stratum number one the top floor
thats Cyrils you know Theyd note the bare floors the sparse but
heavy furniture the piano the violin the flute the booklined walls
and the absence of every sort of curtain cushion or knickknack Here
lived a plain man theyd say a scholar a musician stern unloved
and unloving a monk

And what next Theyd strike Williams stratum next the third floor
Imagine it You know William as a State Street broker welloff
a widower tall angular slow of speech a little bald very much
nearsighted and the owner of the kindest heart in the world But really
to know William you must know his rooms William collects things He
has always collected thingsand hes saved every one of them Theres a
tradition that at the age of one year he crept into the house with four
small round white stones Anyhow if he did hes got them now Rest
assured of thatand hes forty this year Miniatures carved ivories
bugs moths porcelains jades stamps postcards spoons baggage tags
theatre programs playingcardsthere isnt anything that he doesnt
collect Hes on teapots now Imagine itWilliam and teapots And
theyre all there in his roomsone glorious mass of confusion Just
fancy those archaeologists trying to make their monk live there

But when they reach me my stratum theyll have a worse time yet You
see _I_ like cushions and comfort and I have them everywhere And I
likewell I like lots of things My rooms dont belong to that monk
not a little bit And so you see Bertram would finish merrily thats
why I call it all The Strata

And The Strata it was to all the Henshaws friends and even to
William and Cyril themselves in spite of their objection to the term

From babyhood the Henshaw boys had lived in the handsome roomy house
facing the Public Garden It had been their fathers boyhood home as
well and he and his wife had died there soon after Kate the only
daughter had married At the age of twentytwo William Henshaw the
eldest son had brought his bride to the house and together they had
striven to make a home for the two younger orphan boys Cyril twelve
and Bertram six But Mrs William after a short five years of married
life had died and since then the house had known almost nothing of a
womans touch or care

Little by little as the years passed the house and its inmates had
fallen into what had given Bertram his excuse for the name Cyril
thirty years old now dignified reserved averse to cats dogs women
and confusion had early taken himself and his music to the peace
and exclusiveness of the fourth floor Below him William had long
discouraged any meddling with his precious chaos of possessions and had
finally come to spend nearly all his spare time among them This left
Bertram to undisputed ownership of the second floor and right royally
did he hold sway there with his paints and brushes and easels his
old armor rich hangings rugs and cushions and everywhere his
specialtyhis Face of a Girl From canvas plaque and panel they
looked outthose girlish faces winsome wilful pert demure merry
sad beautiful even almost uglythey were all there and they were
growing famous too The world of art was beginning to take notice and
to adjust its spectacles for a more critical glance This Face of a
Girl by Henshaw bade fair to be worth while

Below Bertrams cheery second floor were the dim old library and
drawingrooms silent stately and almost never used and below them
were the diningroom and the kitchen Here ruled Dong Ling the Chinese
cook and Pete

Pete wasindeed it is hard telling what Pete was He said he was the
butler and he looked the part when he answered the bell at the great
front door But at other times when he swept a room or dusted Master
Williams curios he lookedlike nothing so much as what he was a
fussy faithful old man who expected to die in the service he had
entered fifty years before as a lad

Thus in all the Beacon Street house there had not for years been the
touch of a womans hand Even Kate the married sister had long since
given up trying to instruct Dong Ling or to chide Pete though she still
walked across the Garden from her Commonwealth Avenue home and tripped
up the stairs to call in turn upon her brothers Bertram William and
Cyril



CHAPTER III

THE STRATAWHEN THE LETTER COMES


It was on the six oclock delivery that William Henshaw received the
letter from his namesake Billy To say the least the letter was a
great shock to him He had not quite forgotten Billys father who had
died so long ago it is true but he had forgotten Billy entirely Even
as he looked at the disconcerting epistle with its round neatly formed
letters he had great difficulty in ferreting out the particular niche
in his memory which contained the fact that Walter Neilson had had a
child and had named it for him

And this child this Billy this unknown progeny of an all but
forgotten boyhood friend was asking a home and with him Impossible
And William Henshaw peered at the letter as if at this second reading
its message could not be so monstrous

Well old man whats up It was Bertrams amazed voice from the hall
doorway and indeed William Henshaw redfaced and plainly trembling
seated on the lowest step of the stairway and gazing wildeyed at the
letter in his hand was somewhat of an amazing sight What IS up

Whats up groaned William starting to his feet and waving the
letter frantically in the air Whats up Young man do you want us to
take in a child to boarda CHILD he repeated in slow horror

Well hardly laughed the other Er perhaps Cyril might like it
though eh

Come come Bertram be sensible for once pleaded his brother
nervously This is serious really serious I tell you

What is serious demanded Cyril coming down the stairway Cant it
wait Pete has already sounded the gong twice for dinner

William made a despairing gesture

Well come he groaned Ill tell you at the table It seems Ive
got a namesake he resumed in a shaking voice a few moments later
Walter Neilsons child

And whos Walter Neilson asked Bertram

A boyhood friend You wouldnt remember him This letter is from his
child

Well lets hear it Go ahead I fancy we can stand theLETTER eh
Cyril

Cyril frowned Cyril did not know perhaps how often he frowned at
Bertram

The eldest brother wet his lips His hand shook as he picked up the
letter

Itits so absurd he muttered Then he cleared his throat and read
the letter aloud


DEAR UNCLE WILLIAM Do you mind my calling you that You see I want
SOME one and there isnt any one now You are the nearest Ive got
Maybe youve forgotten but Im named for you Walter Neilson was my
father you know My Aunt Ella has just died

Would you mind very much if I came to live with you That is between
timesIm going to college of course and after that Im going to
bewell I havent decided that part yet I think Ill consult you You
may have some preference you know You can be thinking it up until I
come

There Maybe I ought not to have said that for perhaps you wont want
me to come I AM noisy Ill own but not so I think youll mind it much
unless some of you have nerves or a heart You see Miss Letty and
Miss Anntheyre Mr Hardings sisters and Mr Harding is our lawyer
and he will write to you Well where was I Oh I knowon Miss Lettys
nerves And say do you know that is where I do geton Miss Lettys
nerves I do truly You see Mr Harding very kindly suggested that
I live with them but mercy Miss Lettys nerves wont let you walk
except on tiptoe and Miss Anns heart wont let you speak except in
whispers All the chairs and tables have worn little sockets in the
carpets and its a crime to move them There isnt a windowshade in
the house that isnt pulled down EXACTLY to the middle sash except
where the sun shines and those are pulled way down Imagine me and
Spunk living there Oh by the way you dont mind my bringing Spunk
do you I hope you dont for I couldnt live without Spunk and he
couldnt live with out me

Please let me hear from you very soon I dont mind if you telegraph
and just come would be all youd have to say Then Id get ready right
away and let you know what train to meet me on And oh sayif youll
wear a pink in your buttonhole I will too Then well know each other
My address is just Hampden Falls

Your awfully homesick namesake

BILLY HENSHAW NEILSON


For one long minute there was a blank silence about the Henshaw
dinnertable then the eldest brother looking anxiously from one man to
the other stammered

Wwell

Great Scott breathed Bertram

Cyril said nothing but his lips were white with their tense pressure
against each other

There was another pause and again William broke it anxiously

Boys this isnt helping me out any Whats to be done

Done flamed Cyril Surely you arent thinking for a moment of
LETTING that child come here William

Bertram chuckled

He WOULD liven things up Cyril wouldnt he Such nice smooth floors
youve got upstairs to trundle little tin carts across

Tin nonsense retorted Cyril Dont be silly Bertram That letter
wasnt written by a baby Hed be much more likely to make himself at
home with your paint box or with some of Williams junk

Oh I say expostulated William well HAVE to keep him out of those
things you know

Cyril pushed back his chair from the table

Well have to keep him out William you cant be in earnest You
arent going to let that boy come here he cried

But what can I do faltered the man

Do Say no of course As if we wanted a boy to bring up

But I must do something IIm all hes got He says so

Good heavens Well send him to boardingschool then or to the
penitentiary anywhere but here

Shucks Let the kid come laughed Bertram Poor little homesick
devil Whats the use Ill take him in How old is he anyhow

William frowned and mused aloud slowly

Why I dont know He must beerwhy boys hes no child broke off
the man suddenly Walter himself died seventeen or eighteen years ago
not more than a year or two after he was married That child must be
somewhere around eighteen years old

And only think how Cyril WAS worrying about those tin carts laughed
Bertram Never mindeight or eighteenlet him come If hes that age
he wont bother much

And thiserSpunk do you take him too But probably he doesnt
bother either murmured Cyril with smooth sarcasm

Gorry I forgot Spunk acknowledged Bertram Say what in time is
Spunk do you suppose

Dog maybe suggested William

Well whatever he is you will kindly keep Spunk downstairs said
Cyril with decision The boy I suppose I shall have to endure but the
dog

Hmm well judging by his name murmured Bertram apologetically it
may be just possible that Spunk wont be easily controlled But maybe he
isnt a dog anyhow Heersounds something like a parrot to me

Cyril rose to his feet abruptly He had eaten almost no dinner

Very well he said coldly But please remember that I hold you
responsible Bertram Whether its a dog or a parrot oror a monkey
I shall expect you to keep Spunk downstairs This adopting into the
family an unknown boy seems to me very absurd from beginning to end
But if you and William will have it so of course Ive nothing to say
Fortunately my rooms are at the TOP of the house he finished as he
turned and left the diningroom

For a moment there was silence The brows of the younger man were
uplifted quizzically

Im afraid Cyril is bothered murmured William then in a troubled
voice

Bertrams face changed Stern lines came to his boyish mouth

He is always botheredwith anything lately

The elder man sighed

I know but with his talent

Talent Great Scott cut in Bertram Half the world has talent of
one sort or another but that doesnt necessarily make them unable
to live with any one else Really Will its becoming seriousabout
Cyril Hes getting to be for all the world like those finicky old
maids that that young namesake of yours wrote about Hell make us
whisper and walk on tiptoe yet

The other smiled

Dont you worry You arent in any danger of being kept too quiet
young man

No thanks to Cyril then retorted Bertram Anyhow thats one
reason why I was for taking the kidto mellow up Cyril He needs it all
right

But I had to take him Bert argued the elder brother his face
growing anxious again But Heaven only knows what Im going to do with
him when I get him What shall I say to him anyway How shall I write
I dont know how to get up a letter of that sort

Why not take him at his word and telegraph I fancy you wont have to
say come but once before you see him He doesnt seem to be a bashful
youth

Hmm I might do that acquiesced William slowly But wasnt there
somebodya lawyergoing to write to me he finished consulting the
letter by his plate Yes he added after a moment a Mr Harding
Wonder if hes any relation to Ned Harding I used to know Ned at
Harvard and seems as if he came from Hampden Falls Well soon see at
all events Maybe Ill hear tomorrow

I shouldnt wonder nodded Bertram as he rose from the table
Anyhow I wouldnt do anything till I did hear



CHAPTER IV

BILLY SENDS A TELEGRAM


James Hardings letter very promptly followed Billys though it was
not like Billys at all It told something of Billys property and
mentioned that according to Mrs Neilsons will Billy would not
come into control of her fortune until the age of twentyone years was
reached It dwelt at some length upon the fact of Billys loneliness in
the world and expressed the hope that her fathers friend could find it
in his heart to welcome the orphan into his home It mentioned Ned and
the old college friendship and it closed by saying that the writer
James Harding was glad to renew his acquaintance with the good old
Henshaw family that he had known long years ago and that he hoped soon
to hear from William Henshaw himself

It was a good letterbut it was not well written James Hardings
handwriting was not distinguished for its legibility and his
correspondents rejoiced that the most of his letters were dictated to
his stenographer In this case however he had elected to use the more
personal pen and it was because of this that William Henshaw even
after reading the letter was still unaware of his mistake in supposing
his namesake Billy to be a boy

In the main the lawyer had referred to Billy by name or as the
orphan or as that poor lonely child And whenever the more
distinctive feminine her or herself had occurred the carelessly
formed letters had made them so much like his and himself that they
carried no hint of the truth to a man who had not the slightest reason
for thinking himself in the wrong It was therefore still for the boy
Billy that William Henshaw at once set about making a place in the
home

First he telegraphed the single word Come to Billy

Ill set the poor lads heart at rest he said to Bertram I shall
answer Hardings letter more at length of course Naturally he wants to
know something about me now before he sends Billy along but there is no
need for the boy to wait before he knows that Ill take him Of course
he wont come yet till Harding hears from me

It was just here however that William Henshaw met with a surprise for
within twentyfour hours came Billys answer and by telegraph


Im coming tomorrow Train due at five P M

BILLY


William Henshaw did not know that in Hampden Falls Billys trunk had
been packed for days Billy was desperate The house even with the
maid and with the obliging neighbor and his wife who stayed there
nights was to Billy nothing but a dismal tomb Lawyer Harding had
fallen suddenly ill she could not even tell him that the blessed
telegram Come had arrived Hence Billy lonely impulsive and always
used to pleasing herself had taken matters in hand with a confident
grasp and had determined to wait no longer

That it was a fearsomely unknown future to which she was so jauntily
pledging herself did not trouble the girl in the least Billy was
romantic To sally gaily forth with a pink in the buttonhole of her
coat to find her fathers friend who was a Billy too seemed to Billy
Neilson not only delightful but eminently sensible and an excellent
way out of her present homesick loneliness So she bought the pink and
her ticket and impatiently awaited the time to start

To the Beacon Street house Billys cheerful telegram brought the direst
consternation Even Kate was hastily summoned to the family conclave
that immediately resulted

Theres nothingsimply nothing that I can do she declared irritably
when she had heard the story Surely you dont expect ME to take the
boy

No no of course not sighed William But you see I supposed Id
have time toto get used to things and to make arrangements and this
is soso sudden I hadnt even answered Hardings letter until today
and he hasnt got thatmuch less replied to it

But what could you expect after sending that idiotic telegram
demanded the lady Come indeed

But thats what Billy told me to do

What if it was Just because a foolish eighteenyearold boy tells
you to do something must you a supposedly sensible fortyyearold man
obey

I think it tickled Wills romantic streak laughed Bertram It seemed
so sort of alluring to send that one word Come out into space and
watch what happened

Well hes found out certainly observed Cyril with grim
satisfaction

Oh no it hasnt happened yet corrected Bertram cheerfully Its
just going to happen Williams got to put on the pink first you know
Thats the talisman

William reddened

Bertram dont be foolish I shant wear any pink You must know
that

Howll you find him then

Why hell have one on thats enough settled William

Hmm maybe Then hell have Spunk too murmured Bertram
mischievously

Spunk cried Kate

Yes He wrote that he hoped we wouldnt mind his bringing Spunk with
him

Whos Spunk

We dont know Bertrams lips twitched

You dont know What do you mean

Well Will thinks its a dog and I believe Cyril is anticipating a
monkey I myself am backing it for a parrot

Boys what have you done groaned Kate falling back in her chair
What have you done

To William her words were like an electric shock stirring him to instant
action He sprang abruptly to his feet

Well whatever weve done weve done it he declared sternly
and now we must do the restand do it well too Hes the son of my
boyhoods dearest friend and he shall be made welcome Now to business
Bertram you said youd take him in Did you mean it

Bertram sobered instantly and came erect in his chair William did not
often speak like this but when he did

Yes Will He shall have the little bedroom at the end of the hall I
never used the room much anyhow and what few duds I have there shall
be cleared out tomorrow

Good Now there are some other little details to arrange then Ill
go downstairs and tell Pete and Dong Ling And please to understand
were going to make this lad welcomewelcome I say

Yes sir said Bertram Neither Kate nor Cyril spoke



CHAPTER V

GETTING READY FOR BILLY


The Henshaw household was early astir on the day of Billys expected
arrival and preparations for the guests comfort were well under way
before breakfast The center of activity was in the little room at the
end of the hall on the second floor though as Bertram said the whole
Strata felt the upheaval

By breakfast time Bertram with the avowed intention of giving the
little chap half a show had the room cleared for action and after
that the whole house was called upon for contributions toward the rooms
adornment And most generously did most of the house respond Even Dong
Ling slippered upstairs and presented a weird Chinese banner which
he said he was velly much glad to give As to PetePete was in his
element Pete loved boys Had he not served them nearly all his life
Incidentally it may be mentioned that he did not care for girls

Only Cyril held himself aloof But that he was not oblivious of the
proceedings below him was evidenced by the somber bass that floated down
from his piano strings Cyril always played according to the mood that
was on him and when Bertram heard this morning the rhythmic beats of
mournfulness he chuckled and said to William

Thats Chopins Funeral March Evidently Cy thinks this is the death
knell to all his hopes of future peace and happiness

Dear me I wish Cyril would take some interest grieved William

Oh he takes interest all right laughed Bertram meaningly He takes
INTEREST

I know butBertram broke off the elder man anxiously from his
perch on the stepladder would you put the rifle over this window or
the fishingrod

Why I dont think it makes much difference so long as theyre
somewhere answered Bertram And there are these Indian clubs and the
swords to be disposed of you know

Yes and its going to look fine dont you think exulted William
And you know for the wallspace between the windows Im going to bring
down that case of mine of spiders

Bertram raised his hands in mock surprise

Heredown here Youre going to trust any of those precious treasures
of yours down here

William frowned

Nonsense Bertram dont be silly Theyll be safe enough Besides
theyre old anyhow I was on spiders years agowhen I was Billys age
in fact I thought hed like them here You know boys always like such
things

Oh twasnt Billy I was worrying about retorted Bertram It was
youand the spiders

Not much you worry about meor anything else replied William
goodhumoredly There how does that look he finished as he
carefully picked his way down the stepladder

Fineeronly rather warlike maybe with the guns and that riotous
confusion of knives and scimitars over the chiffonier But then maybe
youre intending Billy for a soldier eh

Do you know I AM getting interested in that boy beamed William with
some excitement What kind of things do you suppose he does like

Theres no telling Maybe hes a sissy chap and will howl at your guns
and spiders Perhaps hell prefer autumn leaves and worsted mottoes for
decoration

Not much he will contested the other No son of Walter Neilsons
could be a sissy Neilson was the best halfback in ten years at
Harvard and he was always in for everything going that was worth while
Autumn leaves and worsted mottoes indeed Bah

All right but theres still a dark horse in the case you know We
mustnt forgetSpunk

The elder man stirred uneasily

Bert what do you suppose that creature is You dont think Cyril can
be right and that its amonkey

You never can tell quoted Bertram merrily Of course there ARE
other things If it were you now wed only have to hunt up the special
thing you happened to be collecting at the time and that would be it a
snake a lizard a toad or maybe a butterfly You know you were always
lugging those things home when you were his age

Yes I know sighed William But I cant think its anything like
that he finished as he turned away

There was very little done in the Beacon Street house that day but to
get ready for Billy In the kitchen Dong Ling cooked Everywhere else
except in Cyrils domain Pete dusted and swept and puttered to his
hearts content William did not go to the office at all that day and
Bertram did not touch his brushes Only Cyril attended to his usual
work practising for a coming concert and correcting the proofs of his
new book Music in Russia

At ten minutes before five William anxiouseyed and nervous found
himself at the North Station Then and not till then did he draw a
long breath of relief

There I think everythings ready he sighed to himself At last

He wore no pink in his buttonhole There was no need that he should
accede to that silly request he told himself He had only to look for
a youth of perhaps eighteen years who would be alone a little
frightened possibly and who would have a pink in his buttonhole and
probably a dog on a leash

As he waited the man was conscious of a curious warmth at his heart
It was his namesake Walter Neilsons boy that he had come to meet a
homesick lonely orphan who had appealed to himto him out of all the
world Long years ago in his own arms there had been laid a tiny bundle
of flannel holding a precious little red puckered face But in a
months time the little face had turned cold and waxen and the hopes
that the white flannel bundle had carried had died with the baby
boyand that baby would have been a lad grown by this time if he had
liveda lad not far from the age of this Billy who was coming today
reflected the man And the warmth in his heart deepened and glowed the
more as he stood waiting at the gate for Billy to arrive

The train from Hampden Falls was late Not until quite fifteen minutes
past five did it roll into the trainshed Then at once its long line of
passengers began to sweep toward the iron gate

William was just inside the gate now anxiously scanning every face and
form that passed There were many halfgrown lads but there was not one
with a pink in his buttonhole until very near the end Then William saw
hima pleasantfaced blueeyed boy in a neat gray suit With a low cry
William started forward but he saw at once that the grayclad youth was
unmistakably one of a merry family party He looked to be anything but a
lad that was lonely and forlorn

William hesitated and fell back This debonair selfreliant fellow
could not be Billy But as a hasty glance down the line revealed only
half a dozen straggling women and beyond them no one William decided
that it must be Billy and taking brave hold of his courage he hurried
after the blueeyed youth and tapped him on the shoulder

Erarent you Billy he stammered

The lad stopped and stared He shook his head slowly

No sir he said

But you must be Are you sure

The boy laughed this time

Sorry sir but my name is Frank isnt it mother he added
merrily turning to the lady at his side who was regarding William very
unfavorably through a pair of goldbowed spectacles

William did not wait for more With a stammered apology and a flustered
lifting of his hat he backed away

But where was Billy

William looked about him in helpless dismay All around was a wide
empty space The long aisle to the Hampden Falls train was deserted
save for the baggagemen loading the trunks and bags on to their trucks
Nowhere was there any one who seemed forlorn or ill at ease except a
pretty girl with a suitcase and with a covered basket on her arm who
stood just outside the gate gazing a little nervously about her

William looked twice at this girl First because the splash of color
against her brown coat had called his attention to the fact that she was
wearing a pink and secondly because she was very pretty and her dark
eyes carried a peculiarly wistful appeal

Too bad Bertram isnt here thought William Hed be sketching that
face in no time on his cuff

The pink had given William almost a pang He had been so longing to see
a pinkthough in a different place He wondered sympathetically if she
too had come to meet some one who had not appeared He noticed that she
walked away from the gate once or twice toward the waitingroom and
peered anxiously through the glass doors but always she came back to
the gate as if fearful to be long away from that place He forgot all
about her very soon for her movements had given him a sudden idea
perhaps Billy was in the waitingroom How stupid of him not to think of
it before Doubtless they had missed each other in the crowd and Billy
had gone straight to the waitingroom to look for him And with this
thought William hurried away at once leaving the girl still standing by
the gate alone

He looked everywhere Systematically he paced up and down between the
long rows of seats looking for a boy with a pink He even went out upon
the street and gazed anxiously in all directions It occurred to him
after a time that possibly Billy like himself had changed his mind at
the last moment and not worn the pink Perhaps he had forgotten it or
lost it or even not been able to get it at all Very bitterly William
blamed himself then for disregarding his own part of the suggested
plan If only he had worn the pink himselfbut he had not and it
was useless to repine In the meantime where was Billy he wondered
frantically



CHAPTER VI

THE COMING OF BILLY


After another long search William came back to the trainshed vaguely
hoping that Billy might even then be there The girl was still standing
alone by the gate There was another train on the track now and
the rush of many feet had swept her a little to one side She looked
frightened now and almost ready to cry Still William noticed that
her chin was lifted bravely and that she was making a stern effort at
selfcontrol He hesitated a moment then went straight toward her

I beg your pardon he said kindly lifting his hat but I notice that
you have been waiting here some time Perhaps there is something I can
do for you

A rosy color swept to the girls face Her eyes lost their frightened
appeal and smiled frankly into his

Oh thank you sir There IS something you can do for me if you will
be so kind You see I cant leave this place Im so afraid hell
come and Ill miss him ButI think theres some mistake Could you
telephone for me Billy Neilson was countrybred and in Hampden Falls
all men served all other men and women whether they were strangers or
not so to Billy this was not an extraordinary request to make in the
least

William Henshaw smiled

Certainly I shall be very glad to telephone for you Just tell me whom
you want and what you want to say

Thank you If youll call up Mr William Henshaw then of Beacon
Street please and tell him Billys come Ill wait here

Oh then Billy did come cried the man in glad surprise his face
alight But where is he Do YOU know Billy

I should say I did laughed Billy with the lightness of a longlost
child who has found a friend Why I am Billy myself

To William Henshaw the world swam dizzily and went suddenly mad
The floor rose and the roof fell while cars and people performed
impossible acrobatic feats above below and around him Then from afar
off he heard his own voice stammer

YouareBBilly

Yes and Ill wait here if youll just tell him please Hes
expecting me you know so its all right only perhaps he made a
mistake in the time Maybe you know him anyhow

With one mighty effort William Henshaw pulled himself sharply together
He even laughed and tossed his head in a valiant imitation of Billy
herself but his voice shook

Know himI should say I did he cried Why I am William Henshaw
myself

YouUncle William Why wheres your pink

The mans face was already so red it could not get any redderbut it
tried to do so

Why erIiterif youll just come into the waitingroom a minute
my dear he stuttered miserably IIll explainabout that I shall
have to leave youfor a minute he plunged on frenziedly as he led
the way to a seat Amatter of business that I must attend to Ill
beright back Wait here please And he almost pushed the girl into a
seat and hurried away

At a safe distance William Henshaw turned and looked back His knees
were shaking and his fingers had grown cold at their tips He could see
her plainly as she bent over the basket in her lap He could see even
the pretty curve of her cheek and of her slender throat when she lifted
her head

And that was Billya GIRL

People near him at that moment saw a flushedfaced nervousappearing
man throw up his hands with a despairing gesture roll his eyes
heavenward and then plunge into the nearest telephone booth

In due time William Henshaw had his brother Bertram at the other end of
the wire

Bertram he called shakily

Hullo Will that you Whats the matter Youre late Didnt he come

Come groaned William Good Lord BertramBillys a GIRL

A whwhat

A girl

A GIRL

Yes yes Dont stand there repeating what I say in that idiotic
fashion Bertram Do somethingdo something

despairingly

Well by Jove breathed Bertram

Come come think What shall we do

Why bring her home of course

Homehome chattered William Do you think we five men can bring up

hair

With whaat

smoke Tote her alongI want to see her

But I say we cant keep her there with us Bertram Dont you see we

Then take her to Kates or toto one of those Young Womens Christian
Union things

No no I cant do that Thats impossible Dont you understand Shes
expecting to go home with meHOME Im her Uncle William

Lucky Uncle William

Be still Bertram

Well doesnt she know yourmistakethat you thought she was a boy

Heaven forbidI hope not cried the man fervently I most let it
out once but I think she didnt notice it You see wewe were both
surprised

Well I should say

And Bertram I cant turn her outI cant I tell you Only fancy my
going to her now and saying If you please Billy you cant live at
my house after all I thought you were a boy you know Great Scott
Bert if shed once turned those big brown eyes of hers on you as she

Sounds real interesting

Bertram cant you be serious and help me out

But what CAN we do

I dont know Well have to think but for now get Kate Telephone
her Tell her to come right straight over and that shes got to stay
all night

All night

Of course Billys got to have a chaperon hasnt she Now hurry We

EhohGreat Scott I forgot Spunk I dont know Shes got a basket
Hes in that I suppose Anyhow he cant be any more of a bombshell
than his mistress was Now be quick and none of your fooling Bertram
Tell them allPete and Dong Ling Dont forget I wouldnt have Billy
find out for the world Fix it up with Kate Youll have to fix it up
with her thats all And there came the sharp click of the receiver
against the hook



CHAPTER VII

INTRODUCING SPUNK


In the soft April twilight Cyril was playing a dreamy waltz when Bertram
knocked and pushed open the door

Say old chap youll have to quit your mooning this time and sit up
and take notice

What do you mean Cyril stopped playing and turned abruptly

I mean that Will has gone crazy and I think the rest of us are going
to follow suit

Cyril shrugged his shoulders and whirled about on the piano stool In a
moment his fingers had slid once more into the dreamy waltz

When you get ready to talk sense Ill listen he said coldly

Oh very well if you really want it broken gently its this Will has
met Billy and Billy is a girl Theyre due here now most any time

The music stopped with a crash

AGIRL

Yes a girl Oh Ive been all through that and I know how you feel
But as near as I can make out its really so Ive had instructions to
tell everybody and Ive told I got Kate on the telephone and shes
coming over You KNOW what SHELL be Dong Ling is having what I suppose
are Chinese hysterics in the kitchen and Pete is swinging back and
forth like a pendulum in the diningroom moaning Good Lord deliver
us at every breath I would suggest that you follow me downstairs so
that we may be decently ready forwhatever comes And he turned about
and stalked out of the room followed by Cyril who was too stunned to
open his lips

Kate came first She was not stunned She had a great deal to say

Really this is a little the most absurd thing I ever heard of she
fumed What in the world does your brother mean

That she quite ignored her own relationship to the culprit was not lost
on Bertram He made instant response

As near as I can make out he replied smoothly YOUR brother has
fallen under the sway of a pair of great dark eyes two pink cheeks and
an unknown quantity of curly hair all of which in its entirety is his
namesake is lonesome and is in need of a home

But she cant livehere

Will says she shall

But that is utter nonsense cut in Cyril

For once I agree with you Cyril laughed Bertram but William
doesnt

But how can she do it demanded Kate

Dont know answered Bertram Hes established a petticoat propriety
in you for a few hours at least Meanwhile hes going to think At
least he says he is and that weve got to help him

Humph snapped Kate Well I can prophesy we shant think alikeso
youd notice it

I know that nodded Bertram and Im with you and Cyril on this The
whole thing is absurd The idea of thrusting a silly eighteenyearold
girl here into our lives in this fashion But you know what Will is when
hes really roused You might as well try to move a nice goodnatured
mountain by saying please as to try to stir him under certain
circumstances Most of the time Ill own we can twist him around our
little fingers But not now Youll see In the first place shes the
daughter of his dead friend and she DID write a pathetic little letter
It got to the inside of me anyhow when I thought she was a boy

A boy Who wouldnt think she was a boy interposed Cyril Billy
indeed Can you tell me what for any sane man should have named a girl
Billy

For William your brother evidently retorted Bertram dryly
Anyhow he did it and of course our mistake was a very natural one
The dickens of it is now that weve got to keep it from her so Will
says and howhush here they are he broke off as there came the
sound of wheels stopping before the house

There followed the click of a key in the lock and the opening of a heavy
door then full in the glare of the electric lights stood a plainly
nervous man and a girl with startled appealing eyes

My dear stammered William this is my sister Kate Mrs Hartwell
and here are Cyril and Bertram whom Ive told you of And of course I
dont need to say to them that you are Billy

It was over William drew a long breath and gave an agonized look into
his brothers eyes Then Billy turned from Mrs Hartwell and held out a
cordial hand to each of the men in turn

Oh you dont know how lovely this isto me she cried softly And
to think that you were willing I should come The two younger men
caught their breath sharply and tried not to see each others eyes
You look so goodall of you and I dont believe theres one of you
thats got nerves or a heart she laughed

Bertram rallied his wits to respond to the challenge

No heart Miss Billy Now isnt that just a bit hard on usright at
first

Not a mite if you take it the way I mean it dimpled Billy Hearts
that are all right just keep on pumping and you never know they are
there They arent worth mentioning Its the other kindthe kind that
flutters at the least noise and jumps at the least bang And I dont
believe any of you mind noises and bangs she finished merrily as she
handed her hat and coat to Mrs Hartwell who was waiting to receive
them

Bertram laughed Cyril scowled and occupied himself in finding a chair
William had already dropped himself wearily on to the sofa near his
sister Billy still continued to talk

Now when Spunk and I get to trainingoh and you havent seen Spunk
she interrupted herself suddenly Why the introductions arent half
over Where is he Uncle Williamthe basket

II put it inin the hall mumbled William starting to rise

No no Ill get him cried Billy hurrying from the room She
returned in a moment the green covered basket in her hand Hes been
asleep I guess Hes slept most all the way down anyhow Hes so used
to being toted round in this basket that he doesnt mind it a bit I
take him everywhere in it at the Falls

There was an electric pause Four pairs of startled questioning
fearful eyes were on the basket while Billy fumbled at the knot of the
string The next moment with a triumphant flourish Billy lifted from
the basket and placed on the floor a very small gray kitten with a very
large pink bow

There ladies and gentlemen may I present to you Spunk

The tiny creature winked and blinked and balanced for a moment on
sleepy legs then at the uncontrollable shout that burst from Bertrams
throat he faced the man humped his tiny back bristled his diminutive
tail to almost unbelievable fluffiness and spit wrathfully

And so that is Spunk choked Bertram

Yes said Billy This is Spunk



CHAPTER VIII

THE ROOMAND BILLY


For the first fifteen minutes after Billys arrival conversation was a
fitful thing made up mostly of a merry monologue on the part of Billy
herself interspersed with somewhat dazed replies from one after another
of her auditors as she talked to them in turn No one thought to ask if
she cared to go up to her room and during the entire fifteen minutes
Billy sat on the floor with Spunk in her lap She was still there when
the funereal face of Pete appeared in the doorway Petes jaw dropped
It was plain that only the sternest selfcontrol enabled him to announce
dinner with anything like dignity But he managed to stammer out the
words and then turn loftily away Bertram who sat near the door
however saw him raise his hands in horror as he plunged through the
hall and down the stairway

With a motion to Bertram to lead the way with Billy William frenziedly
gripped his sisters arm and hissed in her ear for all the world like a
villain in melodrama

Listen Youll sleep in Berts room tonight and Bert will come
upstairs with me Get Billy to bed as soon as you can after dinner
and then come back down to us Weve got to plan whats got to be done
Shh And he dragged his sister downstairs

In the diningroom there was a slight commotion Billy stood at her
chair with Spunk in her arms Before her Pete was standing dumbly
staring into her eyes At last he stammered

Maam

A chair please I said for Spunk you know Spunk always sits at the
table right next to me

It was too much for Bertram He fled chokingly to the hall William
dropped weakly into his own place Cyril stared as had Pete but Mrs
Hartwell spoke

You dont meanthat that cathas a chairat the table she gasped

Yes and isnt it cute of him beamed Billy entirely misconstruing
the surprise in the ladys voice His mother always sat at table with
us and behaved beautifully too Of course Spunk is little and makes
mistakes sometimes But hell learn Oh theres a chair right here
she added as she spied Bertrams childhoods highchair which for long
years had stood unused in the corner Ill just squeeze it right in
here she finished gleefully making room for the chair at her side

When Bertram a little red of face but very grave entered the
diningroom a moment later he found the family seated with Spunk snugly
placed between Billy and a plainly disgusted and dismayed brother
Cyril The kitten was alert and interested but he had settled back in
his chair and was looking as absurdly dignified as the flaring pink bow
would let him

Isnt he a dear Billy was saying But Bertram noticed that there was
no reply to this question

It was a peculiar dinnerparty Only Billy did not feel the strain Even
Spunk was not entirely happyhis efforts to investigate the table
and its contents were too frequently curbed by his mistress for his
unalloyed satisfaction William it is true made a valiant attempt to
cause the conversation to be general but he failed dismally Kate
was sternly silent while Cyril was openly repellent Bertram talked
indeedbut Bertram always talked and very soon he and Billy had things
pretty much to themselvesthat is with occasional interruptions caused
by Spunk Spunk had an inquisitive nose or paw for each new dish placed
before his mistress and Billy spent much time admonishing him Billy
said she was training him that it was wonderful what training would do
and of course Spunk WAS little now

Dinner was half over when there was a slight diversion created by
Spunks conclusion to get acquainted with the silent man at his left
Cyril however did not respond to Spunks advances So very evident
indeed was the mans aversion that Billy turned in amazement

Why Mr Cyril dont you see Spunk is trying to say How do you do

Very likely but Im not fond of cats Miss Billy

Youre not fondofcats repeated the girl as if she could not have
heard aright Why not

Cyril changed his position

Why just because IIm not he retorted lamely Isnt there
anything thatthat you dont like

Billy considered

Why not that I know of she began after a moment only rainy days
andtripe And Spunk isnt a bit like those

Bertram chuckled and even Cyril smiledthough unwillingly

All the same he reiterated I dont like cats

Oh Im so sorry lamented Billy and at the grieved hurt in her dark
eyes Bertram came promptly to the rescue

Never mind Miss Billy Cyril is only ONE of us and there is all the
rest of the Strata besides

Thewhat

The Strata You dont know of course but listen and Ill tell you
And he launched gaily forth into his favorite story

Billy was duly amused and interested She laughed and clapped her hands
and when the story was done she clapped them again

Oh what a funny house And how perfectly lovely that Im going to
live in it she cried Then straight at Mrs Hartwell she hurled a
bombshell But where is your stratum she demanded Mr Bertram
didnt mention a thing about you

Cyril said a sharp word under his breath Bertram choked over a cough
Kate threw into Williams eyes a look that was at once angry accusing
and despairing Then William spoke

Ersheit isnt anywhere my dear he stammered or rather it
isnt here Kate lives up on the Avenue you see and is only here
forfor a day or twojust now

Oh murmured Billy And there was not one in the room at that moment
who did not bless Spunkfor Spunk suddenly leaped to the table before
him and in the ensuing confusion his mistress quite forgot to question
further concerning Mrs Hartwells stratum

Dinner over the three men with their sister and Billy trailed
upstairs to the drawingrooms Billy told them then of her life at
Hampden Falls She cried a little at the mention of Aunt Ella and she
portrayed very vividly the lonely life from which she herself had so
gladly escaped She soon had every one laughing even Cyril over her
stories of the lawyers home that might have been hers with its gloom
and its hush and its socketed chairs

As soon as possible however Mrs Hartwell with a murmured I know you
must be tired Billy suggested that the girl go upstairs to her room
Come she added I will show you the way

There was some delay even then for Spunk had to be provided with
sleeping quarters and it was not without some hesitation that Billy
finally placed the kitten in the reluctant hands of Pete who had been
hastily summoned Then she turned and followed Mrs Hartwell upstairs

It seemed to the three men in the drawingroom that almost immediately
came the piercing shriek and the excited voice of their sister in
expostulation Without waiting for more they leaped to the stairway and
hurried up two steps at a time

For heavens sake Kate what is it panted William who had been
outdistanced by his more agile brothers

Kate was on her feet her face the picture of distressed amazement In
the low chair by the window Billy sat where she had flung herself her
hands over her face Her shoulders were shaking and from her throat
came choking little cries

I dont know quavered Kate I havent the least idea She was all
right till she got upstairs here and I turned on the lights Then she
gave one shriek andyou know all I know

William advanced hurriedly

Billy what is the matter What are you crying for he demanded

Billy dropped her hands then and they saw her face She was not crying
She was laughing She was laughing so she could scarcely speak

Oh you did you did she gurgled I thought you did and now I
know

Did what What do you mean Williams usually gentle voice was sharp
Even Williams nerves were beginning to feel the strain of the last few
hours

Thought I was abboy choked Billy You called me he once in the
stationI thought you did but I wasnt surenot till I saw this room
But now I knowI know And off she went into another hysterical gale
of laughterBillys nerves too were beginning to respond to the
excitement of the last few hours

As to the three men and the woman they stood silent helpless looking
into each others faces with despairing eyes

In a moment Billy was on her feet fluttering about the room touching
this thing looking at that Nothing escaped her

Im to fishand shootand fence she crowed And ohlook at
those knives Uugh And my what are these she cried pouncing
on the Indian clubs And look at the spiders Dear dear I AM glad
theyre dead anyhow she shuddered with a nervous laugh that was
almost a sob

Something in Billys voice stirred Mrs Hartwell to sudden action

Come come this will never do she protested authoritatively
motioning her brothers to leave the room Billy is quite tired out and
needs rest She mustnt talk another bit tonight

Of ccourse not stammered William And only too glad of an excuse to
withdraw from a very embarrassing situation the three men called back a
faltering goodnight and precipitately fled downstairs



CHAPTER IX

A FAMILY CONCLAVE


Well William greeted Kate grimly when she came into the
drawingroom after putting her charge to bed have you had enough
now

Enough What do you mean

Kate raised her eyebrows

Why surely youre not thinking NOW that you can keep this girl here
are you

I dont know why not

William

Well where shall she go Will you take her

I Certainly not declared Kate with decision Im sure I see no
reason why I should

No more do I see why William should either cut in Cyril

Oh come whats the use interposed Bertram Let her stay Shes a
nice little thing Im sure

Cyril and Kate turned sharply

Bertram The cry was a duet of angry amazement Then Kate added It
seems that you too have come under the sway of dark eyes pink cheeks
and an unknown quantity of curly hair

Bertram laughed

Oh well she would be nice toerpaint he murmured

See here children demurred William a little sternly all this is
wasting time There is no way out of it I wouldnt be seen turning that
homeless child away now We must keep her thats settled The question
is how shall it be done We must have some woman friend here to be her
companion of course but whom shall we get

Kate sighed and looked her dismay Bertram threw a glance into Cyrils
eyes and made an expressive gesture

You see it seemed to say I told you how it would be

Now whom shall we get questioned William again We must think

Unattached gentlewomen of suitable age and desirable temper did not
prove to be so numerous among the Henshaws acquaintances however as
to make the selection of a chaperon very easy Several were thought of
and suggested but in each case the candidate was found to possess
one or more characteristics that made the idea of her presence utterly
abhorrent to some one of the brothers At last William expostulated

See here boys we arent any nearer a settlement than we were in the
first place There isnt any woman of course who would exactly suit
all of us and so we shall just have to be willing to take some one who
doesnt

The trouble is explained Bertram airily we want some one who will
be invisible to every one except the world and Billy and who will be
inaudible always

I dont know but you are right sighed William But suppose we settle
on Aunt Hannah She seems to be the least objectionable of the lot
and I think shed come Shes alone in the world and I believe the
comfortable roominess of this house would be very grateful to her after
the inconvenience of her stuffy little room over at the Back Bay

You bet it would murmured Bertram feelingly but William did not
appear to hear him

Shes amiable fairly sensible and always a lady he went on and
tomorrow morning I believe Ill run over and see if she cant come
right away

And may I ask whicherstratum shetheywill occupy smiled
Bertram

You may ask but Im afraid you wont find out very soon retorted
William dryly if we take as long to decide that matter as we have the
rest of it

ErCyril has the mostUNOCCUPIED space volunteered Bertram
cheerfully

Indeed retaliated Cyril Suppose you let me speak for myself Of
course so far as truck is concerned Im not in it with you and Will
But as for the USE I put my rooms to Besides I already have Pete
there and would have Dong Ling probably if he slept here However
if you want any of my rooms dont let my petty wants and wishes
interfere

No no interrupted William in quick conciliation We dont want
your rooms Cyril Aunt Hannah abhors stairs Of course I might move I
suppose My rooms are one flight less but if I only didnt have so many
things

Oh you men shrugged Kate wearily Why dont you ask my opinion
sometimes It seems to me that in this case a womans wit might be of
some help

All right go ahead nodded William

Kate leaned forward eagerlyKate loved to manage

Go easy now cautioned Bertram warily You know a strata even one
as solid as ours wont stand too much of an earthquake

It isnt an earthquake at all sniffed Kate Its a very sensible
move all around Here are these two great drawingrooms the library
and the little receptionroom across the hall and not one of them is
ever used but this Of course the women wouldnt like to sleep down
here but why dont you Bertram take the back drawingroom the
library and the little receptionroom for yours and leave the whole of
the second floor for Billy and Aunt Hannah

Good for you Kate cried Bertram appreciatively Youve hit it
square on the head and well do it Ill move tomorrow The light down
here is just as good as it is upstairsif you let it in

Thank you Bertram and you too Kate breathed William fervently
Now if you dont mind I believe Ill go to bed I am tired



CHAPTER X

AUNT HANNAH


As soon as possible after breakfast William went to see Aunt Hannah

Hannah Stetson was not really Williams aunt though she had been called
Aunt Hannah for years She was the widow of a distant cousin and she
lived in a snug little room in a Back Bay boardinghouse She was a
slender whitehaired woman with kind blue eyes and a lovable smile
Her cheeks were still faintly pink and her fine silverwhite hair broke
into little kinks and curls about her ears According to Bertram she
always made one think of lavender and old lace

She welcomed William cordially this morning though with faint surprise
in her eyes

Yes I know Im an early caller and an unexpected one began William
hurriedly And I shall have to plunge straight into the matter too
for there isnt time to preamble Ive taken an eighteenyearold girl
to bring up Aunt Hannah and I want you to come down and live with us
to chaperon her

My grief and conscience WILLIAM gasped the little woman agitatedly

Yes yes I know Aunt Hannah everything you would say if you could
But please skip the hysterics Weve all had them and Kate has already
used every possible adjective that you could think up Now its just
this And he hurriedly gave Mrs Stetson a full account of the case
and told her plainly what he hoped and expected that she would do for
him

Why yes of courseIll come acquiesced the lady a little
breathlessly ifif you are sure youre going tokeep her

Good And remember I said now pleasethat I wanted you to come
right away today Of course Kate cant stay Just get in half a dozen
women to help you pack and come

Half a dozen women in that little room Williamimpossible

Well I only meant to get enough so you could come right off this
morning

But I dont need them William There are only my clothes and books
and such things You know it is a FURNISHED room

All right all right Aunt Hannah I wanted to make sure you hurried
thats all You see I dont want Billy to suspect just how much shes
upsetting us Ive asked Kate to take her over to her house for the
day while Bertram is moving downstairs and while were getting you
settled II think youll like it there Aunt Hannah added William
anxiously Of course Billys got Spunk but he hesitated and smiled
a little

Got what faltered the other

Spunk Oh I dont mean THAT kind laughed William in answer to the
dismayed expression on his aunts face Spunk is a cat

A catbut such a name William II think well change that

Eh Oh you do murmured William with a curious smile Very well be
that as it may Anyhow youre coming and we shall want you all settled
by dinner time he finished as he picked up his hat to go

With Kate Billy spent the long day very contentedly in Kates beautiful
Commonwealth Avenue home The two boys Paul twelve years old and
Egbert eight were a little shy it is true and not really of much use
as companions but there was a little Kate four years old who proved
to be wonderfully entertaining

Billy was not much used to children and she found this fouryearold
atom of humanity to be a great source of interest and amusement She
even told Mrs Hartwell at parting that little Kate was almost as nice
as Spunkwhich remark oddly enough did not appear to please Mrs
Hartwell to the extent that Billy thought that it would

At the Beacon Street house Billy was presented at once to Mrs Stetson

And you are to call me Aunt Hannah my dear said the little woman
graciously just as the boys do

Thank you dimpled Billy and you dont know Aunt Hannah how good
it seems to me to come into so many relatives all at once

Upon going upstairs Billy found her room somewhat changed It was far
less warlike and the case of spiders had been taken away

And this will be your stratum you know announced Bertram from the
stairway yours and Aunt Hannahs Youre to have this whole floor
Will and Cyril are above and Im downstairs

You are Why I thought youwerehere Billys face was puzzled

Here Oh well I did havesome things here he retorted airily but
I took them all away today You see my stratum is downstairs and
it doesnt do to mix the layers By the way you havent been upstairs
yet have you Come on and Ill show youand you too Aunt Hannah

Billy clapped her hands but Aunt Hannah shook her head

Ill leave that for younger feet than mine she said adding
whimsically Its best sometimes that one doesnt try to step too far
off ones own level you know

All right laughed the man Come on Miss Billy

On the door at the head of the stairs he tapped twice lightly

Well Pete called Cyrils voice none too cordially

Pete indeed scoffed Bertram Youve got company young man Open
the door Miss Billy is viewing the Strata

The bare floor echoed to a quick tread then the door opened and Cyril
faced them with a forced smile on his lips

Come inthough I fear there will be littleto see he said

Bertram assumed a pompous attitude

Ladies and gentlemen you behold here the lion in his lair

Be still Bertram ordered Cyril

He is a lion really confided Bertram in a lower voice but as he
prefers it well just call him the Musical Man

I should think I was some sort of musicbox that turned with a crank
bristled Cyril

Bertram grinned

ACRANK did you say Well even I wouldnt have quite dared to say
that you know

With an impatient gesture Cyril turned on his heel Bertram fell once
more into his pompous attitude

Before you is the Mans workshop he orated At your right you see
his instruments of torI mean his instruments a piano flute etc
At your left is the desk with its pens paper erasers ink and postage
stamps I mention these because there areerso few things to mention
here Beyond through the open door one may catch glimpses of still
other rooms but they hold even less than this one holds Tradition
doth assert however that in one is a couchbed and in another two
chairs

Billy listened silently Her eyes were questioning She was not
quite sure how to take Bertrams words and the bare rooms and their
sternfaced master filled her with a vague pity But the pause that
followed Bertrams nonsense seemed to be waiting for her to fill it

Oh I should like to hear youplay Mr Cyril she stammered Then
gathering courage CAN you play The Maidens Prayer

Bertram gave a cough a spasmodic cough that sent him redfaced out
into the hall From there he called

Cant stop for the animals to perform Miss Billy Its most dinner
time and weve got lots to see yet

All right butsometime nodded Billy over her shoulder to Cyril as
she turned away I just love that Maidens Prayer

Now this is Williams stratum announced Bertram at the foot of the
stairs You will perceive that there is no knocking here Williams
doors are always open

By all means Come income in called Williams cheery voice

Oh my what a lot of things exclaimed Billy Mymywhat a lot of
things How Spunk will like this room

Bertram chuckled then he made a great display of drawing a long breath

In the short time at our disposal he began loftily it will be
impossible to point out each particular article and give its history
from the beginning but somewhere you will find four round white stones
which

Eryes we know all about those white stones interrupted William
and youll please let me talk about my own things myself And he
beamed benevolently on the wonderingeyed girl at Bertrams side

But there are so many breathed Billy

All the more chance then smiled William that somewhere among them
youll find something to interest you Now these Chinese ceramics
and these bronzesmaybe youd like those he suggested And with a
resigned sigh and an exaggerated air of submission Bertram stepped back
and gave way to his brother

And there are these miniatures and these Japanese porcelains Or
perhaps youd like stamps or theatre programs better William finished
anxiously

Billy did not reply She was turning round and round her eyes wide and
amazed Suddenly she pounced on a beautifully decorated teapot and held
it up in admiring hands

Oh what a pretty teapot And what a cute little plate it sets in she
cried

The collector fairly bubbled over with joy

Thats a Lowestofta real Lowestoft he crowed Not that
hardpaste stuff from the Orient thats CALLED Lowestoft but the real
thingEnglish you know And thats the tray that goes with it
too Wonderfulhow I got them both You know they most always get
separated I paid a cool hundred for them anyhow

A hundred dollars for a teapot gasped Billy

Yes and heres a nice little piece of lustreware Prettyisnt it
And theres a fine bit of black basalt And

ErWill interposed Bertram meekly

Oh and heres a Castleford cried William paying no attention to
the interruption Marked too see D D  Co Castleford You know
there isnt much of that ware marked This is a beauty too I think
You see this pitted surfacethey made that with tiny little points set
into the inner side of the mold The design stands out fine on this
Its one of the best I ever saw And oh

ErWilliam interposed Bertram again a little louder this time May
I just say

And did you notice this Old Blue hurried on William eagerly Lid
sets down in you seethats older than the kind where it sets over the
top Now heres one

William almost shouted Bertram DINNER IS READY Pete has sounded
the gong twice already

Eh Oh sure enoughsure enough acknowledged William with a
regretful glance at his treasures Well we must go we must go

But I havent seen your stratum at all demurred Billy to her guide
as they went down the stairway

Then theres something left for tomorrow promised Bertram but
you must remember I havent got any beautiful Old Blues and black
basalts to say nothing of stamps and baggage tags But Ill make you
some teasome real teaand thats more than William has done with all
his hundred and one teapots



CHAPTER XI

BERTRAM HAS VISITORS


Spunk did not change his name but that was perhaps the only thing that
did not meet with some sort of change during the weeks that immediately
followed Billys arrival Given a house five men and an ironbound
routine of life and it is scarcely necessary to say that the advent
of a somewhat fussy elderly woman an impulsive young girl and a
verymuchalive small cat will make some difference As to Spunks
nameit was not Mrs Stetsons fault that even that was left
undisturbed

Mrs Stetson early became acquainted with Spunk She was introduced
to him indeed on the night of her arrivalthough fortunately not
at table William had seen to it that Spunk did not appear at dinner
though to accomplish this the man had been obliged to face the amazed
and grieved indignation of the kittens mistress

But I dont see how any one CAN object to a nice clean little cat at
the table Billy had remonstrated tearfully

I know buterthey do sometimes William had stammered and this
is one of the times Aunt Hannah would never stand for itnever

Oh but she doesnt know Spunk Billy had observed then hopefully
You just wait until she knows him

Mrs Stetson began to know Spunk the next day The immediate source of
her knowledge was the discovery that Spunk had found her ball of black
knitting yarn and had delightedly captured it Not that he was content
to let it remain where it wasindeed no He rolled it down the stairs
batted it through the hall to the drawingroom and then proceeded to
chasse with it in and out among the legs of various chairs and tables
ending in one grand whirl that wound the yarn round and round his small
body and keeled him over half upon his back There he blissfully went
to sleep

Billy found him after a gleeful following of the slender woollen trail
Mrs Stetson was with herbut she was not gleeful

Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah gurgled Billy isnt he just too cute
for anything

Aunt Hannah shook her head

I must confess I dont see it she declared My dear just look at
that hopeless snarl

Oh but it isnt hopeless at all laughed Billy Its like one of
those strings they unwind at parties with a present at the end of it
And Spunk is the present she added when she had extricated the small
gray cat And you shall hold him she finished graciously entrusting
the sleepy kitten to Mrs Stetsons unwilling arms

But IitI cantBilly I dont like that name blurted out the
indignant little lady with as much warmth as she ever allowed herself to
show It must be changed toto Thomas

Changed Spunks name changed demanded Billy in a horrified voice
Why Aunt Hannah it cant be changed its HIS you know Then she
laughed merrily Thomas indeed Why you old dearjust suppose I
should ask YOU to change your name Now _I_ like Helen Clarabella lots
better than Hannah but Im not going to ask you to change thatand
Im going to love you just as well even if you are Hannahsee if I
dont And youll love Spunk too Im sure you will Now watch me find
the end of this snarl And she danced over to the dumbfounded little
lady in the big chair gave her an affectionate kiss and then attacked
the tangled mass of black with skilful fingers

But Iyouoh my grief and conscience finished the little woman
whose name was not Helen ClarabellaOh my grief and conscience
according to Bertram was Aunt Hannahs deadliest swearword

In Aunt Hannahs black silk lap Spunk stretched luxuriously and blinked
sleepy eyes then with a long purr of content he curled himself for
another napstill Spunk

It was some time after luncheon that day that Bertram heard a knock at
his studio door Bertram was busy His particular pet Face of a Girl
was to be submitted soon to the judges of a forthcoming Art Exhibition
and it was not yet finished He was trying to make up now for the many
hours lost during the last few days and even Bertram at times did not
like interruptions His model had gone but he was still working rapidly
when the knock came His tone was not quite cordial when he answered

Well

Its ISpunk and I May we come in called a confident voice

Bertram said a sharp word behind his teethbut he opened the door

Of course I waspainting he announced

How lovely And Ill watch you Oh mywhat a pretty room

Im glad you like it

Indeed I do I like it ever so much I shall stay here lots I know

Oh youwill For once even Bertrams ready tongue failed to find
fitting response

Yes Now paint I want to see you Aunt Hannah has gone out anyway and
Im lonesome I think Ill stay

But I cantthat is Im not used to spectators

Of course you arent you poor old lonesomeness But it isnt going to
be that way any more you know now that Ive come I shant let you
be lonesome

I could swear to that declared the man with sudden fervor and for
Billys peace of mind it was just as well perhaps that she did not
know the exact source of that fervency

Now paint commanded Billy again

Because he did not know what else to do Bertram picked up a brush but
he did not paint The first stroke of his brush against the canvas was
to Spunk a challenge and Spunk never refused a challenge With a bound
he was on Bertrams knee gleeful paw outstretched batting at the end
of the brush

Tut tutno nonaughty Spunk Say but wasnt that cute chuckled
Billy Do it again

The artist gave an exasperated sigh

My dear girl he protested cruel as it may seem to you this picture
is not a kindergarten game for the edification of small cats I must
politely ask Spunk to desist

But he wont laughed Billy Never mind we will take it some day
when hes asleep Lets not paint any more anyhow Ive come to see
your rooms And she sprang blithely to her feet Dear dear what a
lot of facesand all girls too How funny Why dont you paint other
things Still they are rather nice

Thank you accepted Bertram dryly

Bertram did not paint any more that afternoon Billy found much to
interest her and she asked numberless questions She was greatly
excited when she understood the full significance of the omnipresent
Face of a Girl and she graciously offered to pose herself for the
artist She spent indeed quite half an hour turning her head from side
to side and demanding Now hows thatand that Tiring at last of
this she suggested Spunk as a substitute remarking that after all
catspretty cats like Spunkwere even nicer to paint than girls

She rescued Spunk then from the paintbox where he had been holding high
carnival with Bertrams tubes of paint and demanded if Bertram ever saw
a more delightful more entrancing more altogethertobedesired
model She was so artless so merry so frankly charmed with it all that
Bertram could not find it in his heart to be angry notwithstanding
his annoyance But when at four oclock she took herself and her cat
cheerily upstairs he lifted his hands in despair

Great Scott he groaned If this is a sample of whats comingIm
GOING thats all



CHAPTER XII

CYRIL TAKES HIS TURN


Billy had been a member of the Beacon Street household a week before she
repeated her visit to Cyril at the top of the house This time Bertram
was not with her She went alone Even Spunk was left behindBilly
remembered her prospective hosts aversion to cats

Billy did not feel that she knew Cyril very well She had tried several
times to chat with him but she had made so little headway that she
finally came to the conclusionprivately expressed to Bertramthat Mr
Cyril was bashful Bertram had only laughed He had laughed the harder
because at that moment he could hear Cyril pounding out his angry
annoyance on the piano upstairsCyril had just escaped from one of
Billys most determined attempts and Bertram knew it Bertrams laugh
had puzzled Billyand it had not quite pleased her Hence today she
did not tell him of her plan to go upstairs and see what she could do
herself alone to combat this foolish bashfulness on the part of Mr
Cyril Henshaw

In spite of her bravery Billy waited quite one whole minute at the top
of the stairs before she had the courage to knock at Cyrils door

The door was opened at once

WhyBilly cried the man in surprise

Yes its Billy II came up toto get acquainted she smiled
winningly

Why eryou are very kind Will youcome in

Thank you yes You see I didnt bring Spunk Iremembered

Cyril bowed gravely

You are very kindagain he said

Billy fidgeted in her chair To her mind she was not getting on at
all She determined on a bold stroke

You see I thought ifif I should come up here where there wouldnt
be so many around we might get acquainted she confided then I would
get to like you just as well as I do the others

At the odd look that came into the mans face the girl realized
suddenly what she had said Her cheeks flushed a confused red

Oh dear That is I meanI like you of course she floundered
miserably then she broke off with a frank laugh There you see I
never could get out of anything I might as well own right up I DONT
like you as well as I do Uncle William and Mr Bertram So there

Cyril laughed For the first time since he had seen Billy something
that was very like interest came into his eyes

Oh you dont he retorted Now that iservery UNkind of you

Billy shook her head

You dont say that as if you meant it she accused him her eyes
gravely studying his face Now IM in earnest _I_ really want to like
YOU

Thank you Then perhaps you wont mind telling me why you dont like
me he suggested

Again Billy flushed

Why II just dont thats all she faltered Then she cried
aggrievedly There now youve made me be impolite and I didnt mean
to be truly

Of course not assented the man and it wasnt impolite because I
asked you for the information you know I may conclude then he went
on with an odd twinkle in his eyes that I am merely classed with tripe
and rainy days

Withwhaat

Tripe and rainy days Those are the only things if I remember rightly
that you dont like

The girl stared then she chuckled

There I knew Id like you better if youd only SAY something she
beamed But lets not talk any more about that Play to me wont you
You know you promised me The Maidens Prayer

Cyril stiffened

Pardon me but you must be mistaken he replied coldly I do not play
The Maidens Prayer

Oh what a shame And I do so love it But you play other things
Ive heard you a little and Mr Bertram says you doin concerts and
things

Does he murmured Cyril with a slight lifting of his eyebrows

There Now off you go again all silent and horrid chaffed Billy
What have I said now Mr Cyrildo you know what I think I believe
youve got NERVES Billys voice was so tragic that the man could but
laugh

Perhaps I have Miss Billy

Like Miss Lettys

Im not acquainted with the lady

Gee wouldnt you two make a pair chuckled Billy unexpectedly No
but really I meando you want people to walk on tiptoe and speak in
whispers

Sometimes perhaps

The girl sprang to her feetbut she sighed

Then Im going This might be one of the times you know She
hesitated then walked to the piano My wouldnt I like to play on
that she breathed

Cyril shuddered Cyril could imagine what Billy would playand Cyril
did not like ragtime nor The Storm

Oh do you play he asked constrainedly

Billy shook her head

Not much Only little bits of things you know she said wistfully as
she turned toward the door

For some minutes after she had gone Cyril stood where she had left him
his eyes moody and troubled

I suppose I might have playedsomething he muttered at last
butThe Maidens Prayergood heavens

Billy was a little shy with Cyril when he came down to dinner that
night For the next few days indeed she held herself very obviously
aloof from him Cyril caught himself wondering once if she were afraid
of his nerves He did not try to find out however he was too
emphatically content that of her own accord she seemed to be leaving him
in peace

It must have been a week after Billys visit to the top of the house
that Cyril stopped his playing very abruptly one day and opened his
door to go downstairs At the first step he started back in amazement

Why Billy he ejaculated

The girl was sitting very near the top of the stairway At his
appearance she got to her feet shamefacedly

Why Billy what in the world are you doing there

Listening

Listening

Yes Do you mind

The man did not answer He was too surprised to find words at once and
he was trying to recollect what he had been playing

You see listening to music this way isnt like listening toto
talking hurried on Billy feverishly It isnt sneaking like that is
it

Whyno

And you dont mind

Why surely I ought not to mindthat he admitted

Then I can keep right on as I have done Thank you sighed Billy in
relief

Keep right on Have you been here before

Why yes lots of days And say Mr Cyril what is thatthat thing
thats all chords with big bass notes that keep saying something so fine
and splendid that it marches on and on getting bigger and grander just
as if there couldnt anything stop it until it all ends in one great
burst of triumph Mr Cyril what is that

Why Billythe interest this time in the mans face was not
faintI wish I might make others catch my meaning as I have evidently
made you do it Thats something of my ownthat Im writing you
understand and Ive tried to sayjust what you say you heard

And I did hear itI did Oh wont you play it please with the door
open

I cant Billy Im sorry indeed I am But Ive an appointment and
Im late now You shall hear it though I promise you and with the
door wide open continued the man as with a murmured apology he
passed the girl and hurried down the stairs

Billy waited until she heard the outer hall door shut then very softly
she crept through Cyrils open doorway and crossed the room to the
piano



CHAPTER XIII

A SURPRISE ALL AROUND


May came and with it warm sunny days There was a little balcony at the
rear of the second floor and on this Mrs Stetson and Billy sat many a
morning and sewed There were occupations that Billy liked better than
sewing but she was dutiful and she was really fond of Aunt Hannah so
she accepted as gracefully as possible that good ladys dictum that a
woman who could not sew and sew well was no lady at all

One of the things that Billy liked to do so much better than to sew was
to play on Cyrils piano She was very careful however that Mr Cyril
himself did not find this out Cyril was frequently gone from the house
and almost as frequently Aunt Hannah took naps At such times it was
very easy to slip upstairs to Cyrils rooms and once at the piano
Billy forgot everything else

One day however the inevitable happened Cyril came home unexpectedly
The man heard the piano from Williams floor and with a surprised
ejaculation he hurried upstairs two steps at a time At the door he
stopped in amazement

Billy was at the piano but she was not playing ragtime The Storm
nor yet The Maidens Prayer There was no music before her but under
her fingers big bass notes very much like Cyrils own were marching
on and on to victory Billys face was rapturously intent and happy

By JoveBilly gasped the man

Billy leaped to her feet and whirled around guiltily

Oh Mr CyrilIm so sorry

Sorryand you play like that

No no Im not sorry I played Its because youfound me

Billys cheeks were a shamed red but her eyes were defiantly brilliant
and her chin was at a rebellious tilt I wasnt doing anyharm not if
you werent herewith your NERVES

The man laughed and came slowly into the room

Billy who taught you to play

No one I cant play I can only pick out little bits of things in C

But you do play I just heard you

Billy shrugged her shoulders

That was nothing It was only what I had heard I was trying to make it
sound likeyours

And by George you succeeded muttered Cyril under his breath then
aloud he asked Didnt you ever study music

Billys eyes dimmed

No That was the only thing Aunt Ella and I didnt think alike about
She had an old square piano all tinpanny and thin you know I played
some on it and wanted to take lessons but I didnt want to practise
on that I wanted a new one Thats what she wouldnt doget me a new
piano or let me do it She said SHE practised on that piano and that
it was quite good enough for me especially to learn on IIm afraid
I got stuffy I hated that piano so But I was almost ready to give in
whenwhen Aunt Ella died

And all you play then is just by ear

Byear I suppose soif you mean what I hear Easy things I can play
quick butbut those chords ARE hard they skip around so

Cyril smiled oddly

I should say so he agreed But perhaps there is something else that
I playthat you like Is there

Oh yes Now theres that little thing that swings and sways like
this cried Billy dropping herself on to the piano stool and whisking
about Billy was not afraid now nor defiant She was only eager and
happy again In a moment a dreamy waltz fell upon Cyrils earsa waltz
that he often played himself It was not played correctly it is true
There were notes and sometimes whole measures that were very different
from the printed music But the tune the rhythm and the spirit were
there

And theres this said Billy and this she went on sliding into
one little strain after anotherall of which were recognized by the
amazed man at her side

Billy he cried when she had finished and whirled upon him again
Billy would you like to learn to playreally play from notes

Oh wouldnt I

Then you shall Well have a piano tomorrow in your rooms for you to
practise on AndIll teach you myself

Oh thank you Mr Cyrilyou dont know how I thank you exulted
Billy as she danced from the room to tell Aunt Hannah of this great and
good thing that had come into her life

To Billy this promise of Cyrils to be her teacher was very kind very
delightful but it was not in the least a thing at which to marvel To
Bertram however it most certainly was

Well guess whats happened he said to William that night after he
had heard the news Ill believe anything nowanything that youll
raffle off your collection of teapots at the next church fair or that
I shall go to Egypt as a Cooky guide Listen Cyril is going to give
piano lessons to BillyCYRIL



CHAPTER XIV

AUNT HANNAH SPEAKS HER MIND


Bertram said that the Strata was not a strata any longer He declared
that between them Billy and Spunk had caused such an upheaval that
there was no telling where one stratum left off and another began What
Billy had not attended to Spunk had he said

You see its like this he explained to an amused friend one day
Billy is taking piano lessons of Cyril and she is posing for one of my
heads Naturally then such feminine belongings as fancywork thread
thimbles and hairpins are due to show up at any time either in Cyrils
apartments or mineto say nothing of Williams and shes in Williams
lotsto look for Spunk if for no other purpose

You must know that Spunk likes Williams floor the best of the bunch
there are so many delightful things to play with Not that Spunk stays
theredear me no Hes a sociable little chap and his usual course is
to pounce on a shelf knock off some object that tickles his fancy
then lug it in his mouth towell anywhere that he happens to feel like
going Cyril has found him upstairs with a small miniature battered
and chewed almost beyond recognition And Aunt Hannah nearly had a fit
one day when he appeared in her room with an enormous hardshelled black
bugdead of coursethat he had fished from a case that Pete had left
open As for me I can swear that the little round white stone he was
playing with in my part of the house was one of Williams Collection
Number One

And that isnt all Bertram continued Billy brings her music down to
show to me and lugs my heads all over the rest of the house to show
to other folks And there is always everywhere a knit shawl for Aunt
Hannah is sure to feel a draught and Billy keeps shawls handy So there
you are We certainly arent a strata any longer he finished

Billy was indeed very much at home in the Beacon Street housetoo
much so Aunt Hannah thought Aunt Hannah was in fact seriously
disturbed To William one evening late in May she spoke her mind

William what are you going to do with Billy she asked abruptly

Do with her What do you mean returned William with the contented
smile that was so often on his lips these days This is Billys home

Thats the worst of it sighed the woman with a shake of her head

The worst of it Aunt Hannah what do you mean Dont you like Billy

Yes yes William of course I like Billy I love her Who could help
it Thats not what I mean Its of Billy Im thinking and of the rest
of you She cant stay here like this She must go away to school
oror somewhere

And shes going in September replied the man Shell go to
preparatory school first and to college probably

Yes but nowright away She ought to gosomewhere

Why yes for the summer of course But those plans arent completed
yet Billy and I were talking of it last evening You know the boys are
always away more or less but I seldom go until August and we let Pete
and Dong Ling off then for a month and close the house I told Billy Id
send you and her anywhere she liked for the whole summer but she says
no She prefers to stay here with me But I dont quite fancy that
ideathrough all the hot June and Julyso I dont know but Ill get a
cottage somewhere near at one of the beaches where I can run back and
forth night and morning Of course in that case we take Pete and Dong
Ling with us and close the house right away I fear Cyril would not
fancy it much but after all he and Bertram would be off more or less
They always are in the summer

But William you havent yet got my idea at all demurred Aunt
Hannah with a discouraged shake of her head Its awayaway from all
thisfrom youthat I want to get Billy

Away Away from me cried the man with an odd intonation of terror
as he started forward in his chair Why Aunt Hannah what are you
talking about

About Billy This is no place in which to bring up a young girla
young girl who has not one shred of relationship to excuse it

But she is my namesake and quite alone in the world Aunt Hannah
quite alonepoor child

My dear William that is exactly itshe is a child and yet she is
not Thats where the trouble lies

What do you mean

William Billy has been brought up in a little country town with a
spinster aunt and a whole goodnatured tolerant village for company
Well she has accepted you and your entire household even down to Dong
Ling on the same basis

Well Im sure Im glad asserted the man with genial warmth Its
good for us to have her here Its good for the boys Shes already
livened Cyril up and toned Bertram down I may as well confess Aunt
Hannah that Ive been more than a little disturbed about Bertram of
late I dont like that Bob Seaver that he is so fond of and some other
fellows too that have been coming here altogether too much during
the last year Bertram says theyre only a little Bohemian in their
tastes And to me thats the worst of it for Bertram himself is quite
too much inclined that way

Exactly William And that only goes to prove what I said before
Bertram is not a spinster aunt and neither are any of the rest of you
But Billy takes you that way

Takes us that wayas spinster aunts

Yes She makes herself as free in this house as she was in her Aunt
Ellas at Hampden Falls She flies up to Cyrils rooms half a dozen
times a day with some question about her lessons and I dont know how
long shed sit at his feet and adoringly listen to his playing if he
didnt sometimes get out of patience and tell her to go and practise
herself She makes nothing of tripping into Bertrams studio at all
hours of the day and hes sketched her head at every conceivable
anglewhich certainly doesnt tend to make Billy modest or retiring
As to youyou know how much shes in your rooms spending evening after
evening fussing over your collections

I know but werewere sorting them and making a catalogue defended
the man anxiously Besides II like to have her there She doesnt
bother me a bit

No I know she doesnt replied Aunt Hannah with a curious
inflection But dont you see William that all this isnt going to
quite do Billys too youngand too old

Come come Aunt Hannah is that exactly logical

Its true at least

But after all wheres the harm Dont you think that you are just a
little bit toofastidious Billys nothing but a carefree child

Its the free part that I object to William She has taken every one
of you into intimate companionshipeven Pete and Dong Ling

Pete and Dong Ling

Yes Mrs Stetsons chin came up and her nostrils dilated a little
Billy went to Pete the other day to have him button her shirtwaist
up in the back and yesterday I found her downstairs in the kitchen
instructing Dong Ling how to make chocolate fudge

William fell back in his chair

Well well he muttered well well She is a child and no mistake
He paused his brows drawn into a troubled frown But Aunt Hannah
what CAN I do Of course you could talk to her butI dont seem to
quite like that idea

My grief and conscienceno no That isnt what is needed at all
It would only serve to make her selfconscious and thats her one
salvation nowthat she isnt selfconscious You see its only the
fault of her environment and training after all It isnt her heart
thats wrong

Indeed it isnt

It will be different when she is olderwhen she has seen a little more
of the world outside Hampden Falls Shell go to school of course and
I think she ought to travel a little Meanwhile she mustnt livejust
like this though certainly not for a time at least

No no Im afraid not agreed William perplexedly rising to his
feet But we must thinkwhat can be done His step was even slower
than usual as he left the room and his eyes were troubled



CHAPTER XV

WHAT BERTRAM CALLS THE LIMIT


At half past ten oclock on the evening following Mrs Stetsons very
plain talk with William the telephone bell at the Beacon Street house
rang sharply Pete answered it

WellPete never said hello

Hello Is that you Pete called Billys voice agitatedly Is Uncle
William there

No Miss Billy

Oh dear Well Mr Cyril then

Hes out too Miss Billy And Mr Bertramtheyre all out

Yes yes I know HES out almost sobbed Billy Dear dear what
shall I do Pete youll have to come There isnt any other way

Yes Miss where Petes voice was dubious but respectful

To the Boylston Street subwayon the Common you knowNorthbound
side Ill wait for youbut HURRY You see Im all alone here

Alone Miss Billyin the subway at this time of night But Miss
Billy you shouldntyou cantyou mustnt stuttered the old man in
helpless horror

Yes yes Pete but never mind I am here And I should think if twas
such a dreadful thing you would hurry FAST to get here so I wouldnt be
alone appealed Billy

With an inarticulate cry Pete jerked the receiver on to the hook and
stumbled away from the telephone Five minutes later he had left the
house and was hurrying through the Common to the Boylston Street subway
station

Billy a long cloak thrown over her white dress was waiting for him
Her white slippers tapped the platform nervously and her hair under
the light scarf of lace fluffed into little broken curls as if it had
been blown by the wind

Miss Billy Miss Billy what can this mean gasped the man Where is
Mrs Stetson

At Mrs Hartwellsyou know she is giving a reception tonight But
come we must hurry Im after Mr Bertram

After Mr Bertram

Yes yes

Alonelike this

But Im not alone now I have you Dont you see

At the blank stupefaction in the mans face the girl sighed
impatiently

Dear me I suppose Ill have to explain but were losing timeand we
mustntwe mustnt she cried feverishly Listen then quick It was
at Mrs Hartwells tonight Id been watching Mr Bertram He was
with that horrid Mr Seaver and I never liked him never I overheard
something they said about some place they were going to and I didnt
like what Mr Seaver said I tried to speak to Mr Bertram but I didnt
get a chance and the next thing I knew hed gone with that Seaver man
I saw them just in time to snatch my cloak and follow them

FOLLOW them MISS BILLY

I had to Pete dont you see There was no one else Mr Cyril and
Uncle William had gonehome I supposed I sent back word by the maid
to Aunt Hannah that Id gone ahead you know the carriage was ordered
for eleven but Im afraid she wont have sense to tell Aunt Hannah she
looked so dazed and frightened when I told her But I COULDNT wait to
say more Well I hurried out and caught up with Mr Bertram just as
they were crossing Arlington Street to the Garden Id heard them say
they were going to walk so I knew I could do it But Pete after I got
there I didnt dare to speakI didnt DARE to So I justfollowed
They went straight through the Garden and across the Common to Tremont
Street and on and on until they stopped and went down some stairs all
marble and lights and mirrors Twas a restaurant I think I saw just
where it was then I flew back here to telephone for Uncle William I
knew HE could do something Butwell you know the rest I had to take
you Now come quick Ill show you

But Miss Billy I cant You mustnt its impossible chattered old
Pete Come let me take ye home Miss Billy do

Homeand leave Mr Bertram with that Seaver man No no

What CAN ye do

Do I can get him to come home with me of course

The old man made a despairing gesture and looked about him as if for
help He saw then the curious questioning eyes on all sides and with a
quick change of manner he touched Miss Billys arm

Yes well go Come he apparently agreed But once outside on the
broad expanse before the Subway entrance he stopped again Miss Billy
please come home he implored Ye dont knowye cant know what yer
adoin

The girl tossed her head She was angry now

Pete if you will not go with me I shall go alone I am not afraid

But the hourthe placeyou a young girl Miss Billy remonstrated
the old man agitatedly

It isnt so very late Ive been out lots of times later than this
at home And as for the place its all light and bright and lots of
people were going inladies and gentlemen Nothing could hurt me Pete
and I shall go but Id rather you were with me Why Pete we mustnt
leave him He isnthe isnt HIMSELF Pete Hehes been DRINKING
Billys voice broke and her face flushed scarlet She was almost
crying Come you wont refuse now she finished resolutely turning
toward the street

And because old Pete could not pick her up bodily and carry her home
he followed close at her heels At the head of the marble stairs all
lights and mirrors however he made one last plea

Miss Billy once more I beg of ye wont ye come home Ye dont know
what yer adoin Miss Billy ye dontye dont

I cant go home persisted Billy I must get Mr Bertram away from
that man Now come well just stand at the door and look in until we
see him Then Ill go straight to him and speak to him And with that
she turned and ran down the steps

Billy blinked a little at the lights which reflected in the great
plateglass mirrors were a million dazzling points that found
themselves again repeated in the sparkling crystal and glittering silver
on the flowerdecked tables All about her Billy saw flushedfaced men
and brighteyed women laughing chatting and clinking together their
slenderstemmed wine glasses But nowhere as she looked about her
could Billy descry the man she sought

The head waiter came forward with uplifted hand but Billy did not see
him A girl at her left laughed disagreeably and several men stared
with boldly admiring eyes but to them too Billy paid no heed Then
halfway across the room she spied Bertram and Seaver sitting together at
a small table alone

Simultaneously her own and Bertrams eyes met

With a sharp word under his breath Bertram sprang to his feet His
befogged brain had cleared suddenly under the shock of Billys presence

Billy for Heavens sake what are you doing here he demanded in a low
voice as he reached her side

I came for you I want you to go home with me please Mr Bertram
whispered Billy pleadingly

The man had not waited for an answer to his question With a deft
touch he had turned Billy toward the door and even as she finished
her sentence she found herself in the marble hallway confronting Pete
pallidfaced and shaking

And you too Pete Great Scott what does this mean he exploded
angrily

Pete could only shake his head and glance imploringly at Billy His dry
lips and tongue refused to articulate even one word

We cameforyou choked Billy You see I dont like that Seaver
man

Well by Jove this is the limit breathed Bertram



CHAPTER XVI

KATE TAKES A HAND


Undeniably Billy was in disgrace and none knew it better than Billy
herself The whole family had contributed to this knowledge Aunt Hannah
was inexpressibly shocked she had not breath even to ejaculate My
grief and conscience Kate was disgusted Cyril was coldly reserved
Bertram was frankly angry even William was vexed and showed it Spunk
too as if in league with the rest took this opportunity to display one
of his occasional fits of independence and when Billy longing for some
sort of comfort called him to her he settled back on his tiny haunches
and imperturbably winked and blinked his indifference

Nearly all the family had had something to say to Billy on the matter
with not entirely satisfactory results when Kate determined to see what
she could do She chose a time when she could have the girl quite to
herself with small likelihood of interruption

But Billy how could you do such an absurd thing she demanded The
idea of leaving my house alone at halfpast ten at night to follow a
couple of men through the streets of Boston and then with my brothers
butler make a scene like that in aa public diningroom

Billy sighed in a discouraged way

Aunt Kate cant I make you and the rest of them understand that I
didnt start out to do all that I meant just to speak to Mr Bertram
and get him away from that man

But my dear child even that was bad enough

Billy lifted her chin

You dont seem to think Aunt Kate Mr Bertram waswas not sober

All the more reason then why you should NOT have done what you did

Why Aunt Kate you wouldnt leave him alone in that condition with
that man

It was Mrs Hartwells turn to sigh

But Billy she contested wearily cant you understand that it
wasnt YOUR place to interfereyou a young girl

Im sure I dont see what difference that makes I was the only one
that could do it Besides afterward I did try to get some one else
Uncle William and Mr Cyril But when I found I couldnt get them I
just had to do it alonethat is with Pete

Pete scoffed Mrs Hartwell Pete indeed

Billys head came up with a jerk Billy was very angry now

Aunt Kate it seems Ive done a very terrible thing but Im sure I
dont see it that way I wasnt afraid and I wasnt in the least bit of
danger anywhere I knew my way perfectly and I did NOT make any scene
in that restaurant I just asked Mr Bertram to come home with me One
would think you WANTED Mr Bertram to go off with that man andand
drink too much But Uncle William hasnt liked him before not one bit
Ive heard him talk about himthat Mr Seaver

Mrs Hartwell raised both her hands palms outward

Billy it is useless to talk with you You are quite impossible It is
even worse than I expected she cried with wrathful impatience

Worse than youexpected What do you mean please

Worse than I thought it would bebefore you came The idea of those
five men taking a girl to bring up

Billy sat very still She was even holding her breath though Mrs
Hartwell did not know that

You meanthat they did notwant me she asked quietly so quietly
that Mrs Hartwell did not realize the sudden tension behind the words
For that matter Mrs Hartwell was too angry now to realize anything
outside of herself

Want you Billy it is high time that you understand just how things
are and have been at the house then perhaps you will conduct yourself
with an eye a little more to other peoples comfort Can you imagine
three young men like my brothers WANTING to take a strange young woman
into their home to upset everything

Toupseteverything echoed Billy faintly And have I donethat

Of course you have How could you help it To begin with they thought
you were a boy and that was bad enough but William was so anxious
to do right by his dead friend that he insisted upon taking you much
against the will of all the rest of us Oh I know this isnt pleasant
for you to hear admitted Mrs Hartwell in response to the dismayed
expression in Billys eyes but I think its high time you realize
something of what those men have sacrificed for you Now to resume
When they found you were a girl what did they do Did they turn you
over to some school or such place as they should have done Certainly
not William would not hear of it He turned Bertram out of his rooms
put you into them and established Aunt Hannah as chaperon and me as
substitute until she arrived But because through it all he smiled
blandly you have been blind to the whole thing

And what is the result His entire household routine is shattered to
atoms You have accepted the whole house as if it were your own
You take Cyrils time to teach you music and Bertrams to teach you
painting without a thought of what it means to them There I suppose
I ought not to have said all this but I couldnt help it Billy And
surely now NOW you appreciate a little more what your coming to this
house has meant and what my brothers have done for you

I do certainly said Billy still in that voice that was so oddly
smooth and emotionless

And youll try to be more tractable less headstrong less assertive of
your presence

The girl sprang to her feet now

More tractable Less assertive of my presence she cried Mrs
Hartwell do you mean to say you think Id STAY after what youve told
me

Stay Why of course youll stay Dont be silly child I didnt tell
you this to make you go I only wanted you to understand how things
wereand are

And I do understandand Im going

Mrs Hartwell frowned Her face changed color

Come come Billy this is nonsense William wants you here He would
never forgive me if anything I said should send you away You must not
be angry with him

Billy turned now like an enraged little tigress

Angry with him Why I love himI love them all They are the dearest
men ever and theyve been so good to me The girls voice broke a
little then went on with a more determined ring Do you think Id have
them know why Im goingthat Id hurt them like that Never

But Billy what are you going to do

I dont know Ive got to plan it out I only know now that Im going
sure And with a choking little cry Billy ran from the room

In her own chamber a minute later the tears fell unrestrained

Its homeall the home there isanywhere she sobbed But its got
to goits got to go



CHAPTER XVII

A PINKRIBBON TRAIL


Mrs Stetson wore an air of unmistakable relief as she stepped into
Williams sittingroom Even her knock at the halfopen door had sounded
almost triumphant

William it does seem as if Fate itself had intervened to help us
out she began delightedly Billy of her own accord came to me this
morning and said that she wanted to go away with me for a little trip
So you see that will make it easier for us

Good That is fortunate indeed cried William but his voice did not
carry quite the joy that his words expressed I have been disturbed
ever since your remarks the other day he continued wearily and of
course her extraordinary escapade the next evening did not help matters
any It is better I know that she shouldnt be herefor a time
Though I shall miss her terribly But tell me what is itwhat does
she want to do

She says she guesses she is homesick for Hampden Falls that shed
like to go back there for a few weeks this summer if Ill go with her
Thethe dear child seems suddenly to have taken a great fancy to me
explained Aunt Hannah unsteadily I never saw her so affectionate

She is a dear girla very dear girl and she has a warm heart
William cleared his throat sonorously but even that did not clear
his voice It was her heart that led her wrong the other night he
declared Hers was a brave and fearless actbut a very unwise one
Much as I deplore Bertrams intimacy with Seaver I should hesitate to
take the course marked out by Billy Bertram is not a child But tell me
more of this trip of yours How did Billy happen to suggest it

I dont know I noticed yesterday that she seemed strangely
silentunhappy in fact She sat alone in her room the greater part of
the day and I could not get her out of it But this morning she came to
my door as bright as the sun itself and made me the proposition I told
you of She says her aunts house is closed awaiting its sale but that
she would like to open it for awhile this summer if Id like to go
Naturally you can understand that Id very quickly fall in with a plan
like thatone which promised so easily to settle our difficulties

Yes of course of course muttered William It is very fine very
fine indeed he concluded And again his voice failed quite to match
his words in enthusiasm

Then Ill go and begin to see to my things murmured Mrs Stetson
rising to her feet Billy seems anxious to get away

Billy did indeed seem anxious to get away She announced her intended
departure at once to the family She called it a visit to her old home
and she seemed very glad in her preparations If there was anything
forced in this gayety no one noticed it or at least no one spoke of
it The family saw very little of Billy indeed these days She said
that she was busy that she had packing to do She stopped taking
lessons of Cyril and visited Bertrams studio only once during the
whole three days before she went away and then merely to get some
things that belonged to her On the fourth day almost before the family
realized what was happening she was gone and with her had gone Mrs
Stetson and Spunk

The family said they liked itthe quiet the freedom They said they
liked to be aloneall but William He said nothing

And yet

When Bertram went to his studio that morning he did not pick up his
brushes until he had sat for long minutes before the sketch of a
redcheeked curlyheaded young girl whose eyes held a peculiarly
wistful appeal and Cyril at his piano upstairs sat with idle fingers
until they finally drifted into a simple little melodythe last thing
Billy had been learning

It was Pete who brought in the kitten and Billy had been gone a whole
week then

The poor little beast was cryin at the alleyway door sir he
explained II made so bold as to bring him in

Of course said William Did you feed it

Yes sir Ling did

There was a pause then Pete spoke diffidently

I thought sir if ye didnt mind Id keep it Ill try to see that it
stays downstairs sir out of yer way

Thats all right Pete keep it by all means by all means approved
William

Thank ye sir Ye see its a stray It hasnt got any home And did
ye notice sir it looks like Spunk

Yes I noticed said William stirring with sudden restlessness I
noticed

Yes sir said Pete And he turned and carried the small gray cat
away

The new kitten did not stay downstairs Pete tried it is true to keep
his promise to watch it but after he had seen the little animal
carried surreptitiously upstairs in Mr Williams arms he relaxed
his vigilance Some days later the kitten appeared with a huge pink bow
behind its ears somewhat awkwardly tied if it must be confessed
Where it came from or who put it there was not knownuntil one day the
kitten was found in the hall delightedly chewing at the end of what had
been a roll of pink ribbon Up the stairs led a trail of pink ribbon and
curling white paperand the end of the trail was in Williams room



CHAPTER XVIII

BILLY WRITES ANOTHER LETTER


By the middle of June only William and the gray kitten were left with
Pete and Dong Ling in the Beacon Street house Cyril had sailed for
England and Bertram had gone on a sketching trip with a friend

To William the house this summer was unusually lonely indeed he found
the silent deserted rooms almost unbearable Even the presence of the
little gray cat served only to accentuate the lonelinessit reminded
him of Billy

William missed Billy He owned that now even to Pete He said that he
would be glad when she came back To himself he said that he wished he
had not fallen in quite so readily with Aunt Hannahs notion of getting
the child away It was all nonsense he declared All she needed was a
little curbing and directing both of which could just as well have been
done there at home But she had gone and it could not be helped now
The only thing left for him to do was to see that it did not occur
again When Billy came back she should stay except for necessary
absences for school of course All this William settled in his own mind
quite to his own satisfaction entirely forgetting strange to say that
it had been Billys own suggestion that she go away

Very promptly William wrote to Billy He told her how he missed her and
said that he had stopped trying to sort and catalogue his collections
until she should be there to help him He told her too after a time
of the gray kitten Spunkie that looked so much like Spunk

In reply he received plump white envelopes directed in the round
schoolboy hand that he remembered so well In the envelopes were
letters cheery and entertaining like Billy herself They thanked him
for all his many kindnesses and they told him something of what Billy
was doing They showed unbounded interest in the new kitten and in all
else that William wrote about but they hinted very plainly that he had
better not wait for her to help him out on the catalogue for it would
soon be autumn and she would be in school

William frowned at this and shook his head yet he knew that it was
true

In August William closed the Beacon street house and went to the
Rangeley Lakes on a camping trip He told himself that he would not
go had it not been for a promise given to an old college friend months
before True he had been anticipating this trip all winter but it
occurred to him now that it would be much more interesting to go to
Hampden Falls and see Billy He had been to the Rangeley Lakes and he
had not been to Hampden Falls besides there would be Ned Harding and
those queer old maids with their shaded house and socketed chairs to
see In short to William at the moment there seemed no place quite
so absorbingly interesting as was Hampden Falls But he went to the
Rangeley Lakes

In September Cyril came back from Europe and Bertram from the
Adirondacks where he had been spending the month of August William
already had arrived and with Pete and Dong Ling had opened the house

Wheres Billy Isnt Billy here demanded Bertram

No She isnt back yet replied William

You dont mean to say shes stayed up there all summer exclaimed
Cyril

Why yes II suppose so hesitated William You see I havent
heard but once for a month Ive been down in Maine you know

William wrote to Billy that night

My dear he said in part I hope youll come home right away We
want to see SOMETHING of you before you go away again and you know the
schools will be opening soon

By the way it has just occurred to me as I write that perhaps after
all you wont have to go quite away There are plenty of good schools
for young ladies right in and near Boston which I am sure you could
attend and still live at home Suppose you come back then as soon as
you can and well talk it up And that reminds me I wonder how Spunk
will get along with Spunkie Spunkie has been boarding out all August at
a cat home but he seems glad to get back to us I am anxious to see the
two little chaps together just to find out how much alike they really
do look

Very promptly came Billys answer but Williams face after he had read
the letter was almost as blank as it had been on that April day when
Billys first letter camethough this time for a far different reason

Why boys sheisntcoming he announced in dismay

Isnt coming ejaculated two astonished Voices

No

NotatALL

Why of course later retorted William with unwonted sharpness But
not now This is what she says And he read aloud


DEAR UNCLE WILLIAMYou poor dear man Did you think Id really let
you spend your time and your thought over hunting up a school for me
after all the rest you have done for me Not a bit of it Why Aunt
Hannah and I have been buried under school catalogues all summer and
I have studied them all until I know just which has turkey dinners
on Sundays and which ice cream at least twice a week And its all
settled too long ago Im going to a girls school up the Hudson a
little waya lovely place Im sure from the pictures of it

Oh and another thing I shall go right from here Two girls at Hampden
Falls are going and I shall go with them Isnt that a fine chance
for me You see it would never do anyway for me to go aloneme a
Billyunless I sent a special courier ahead to announce that Billy
was a girl

Aunt Hannah has decided to stay here this winter in the old house She
likes it ever so much and I dont think I shall sell the place just
yet anyway She will go back of course to Boston after Ive gone
to get some things at the house that shell want and also to do some
shopping But shell let you know when shell be there

Ill write more later but just now Im in a terrible rush I only
write this note to set your poor heart at rest about having to hunt up a
school for me

With love to all

BILLY


As had happened once before after a letter from Billy had been read
there was a long pause

Well by Jove breathed Bertram

Its very sensible Im sure declared Cyril Still I must confess
I would have liked to pick out her piano teacher for her

William said nothingperhaps because he was reading Billys letter
again

At eight oclock that night Bertram tapped on Cyrils door

Whats the trouble demanded Cyril in answer to the look on the
others face

Bertram lifted his eyebrows oddly

Im not sure whether youll call it trouble or not he replied but
I think its safe to say that Billy is gonefor good

For good What do you meanthat shes not coming backever

Exactly that

Nonsense Whats put that notion into your head

Billys letter first after that Pete

Pete

Yes He came to me a few minutes ago looking as if he had seen a
ghost It seems he swept Billys rooms this morning and put them in
order against her coming and tonight William told him that she wouldnt
be here at present Pete came straight to me He said he didnt dare
tell Mr William but hed got to tell some one there wasnt one
single thing of Miss Billys left in her rooms nor anywhere else in the
housenot so much as a handkerchief or a hairpin

Hmm that does looksuspicious murmured Cyril Whats up do you
think

Dont know but something sure Still of course we may be wrong
We wont say anything to Will about it anyhow Poor old chap twould
worry him specially if he thought Billys feelings had been hurt

Hurtnonsense Why we did everything for hereverything

Yes I knowand she tried to do EVERYTHING for us too retorted
Bertram quizzically as he turned away



CHAPTER XIX

SEEING BILLY OFF


Early in October Mrs Stetson arrived at the Beacon Street house but
she did not stay long

Ive come for just a few things I want and to do some shopping she
explained

But Aunt Hannah remonstrated William what is the meaning of this
Why are you staying up there at Hampden Falls

I like it there William and why shouldnt I stay Surely theres no
need for me to be here now with Billy away

But Billys coming back

Of course shes coming back laughed Aunt Hannah but not this
winter certainly Why William whats the matter Im sure I think
its a beautiful arrangement Why dont you remember Its just what we
said we wantedto keep Billy away for awhile And the best part of it
is its her own idea from the start

Yes I know I know frowned William but Im not sure after all
that that idea of ours wasnt a mistakea mistake that she needed to
get away

Never We were just right about it declared Aunt Hannah with
conviction

And is Billyhappy

She seems to be

Hmm well THATS good said William as he turned to go up to his
room But as he climbed the stairs he sighed and to hear him one would
have thought it anything but good to himthat Billy was happy

One by one the weeks passed Mrs Stetson had long since gone back to
Hampden Falls and Bertram said that the Strata was beginning to look
natural again There remained now indeed only Spunkie the small gray
cat to remind any one of the days that were gonethough to be sure
there were Billys letters if they might be called a reminder

Billy did not write often She said that she was too busy to breathe
Such letters as did come from her were addressed to William though they
soon came to be claimed by the entire family Bertram and Cyril frankly
demanded that William read them aloud and even Pete always contrived to
have some dusting or puttering within earshota subterfuge quite well
understood but never reproved by any of the brothers

When the Christmas vacation drew near William wrote that he hoped
Billy and Aunt Hannah would spend it with them but Billy answered that
although she appreciated their kindness and thanked them for it yet she
must decline their invitation as she had already invited several of the
girls to go home with her to Hampden Falls for a country Christmas

For the Easter vacation William was even more insistentbut so was
Billy she had already accepted an invitation to go home with one of
the girls and she did not think it would be at all polite to change her
plans now

William fretted not a little Even Cyril and Bertram said that it was
too bad that they themselves would like to see the girlso they
would

It was in the spring at the close of school however that the heaviest
blow fell Billy was not coming to Boston even then She wrote that she
and Aunt Hannah were going to run across the water for a little trip
through the British Isles and that their passage was already engaged

And so you see she explained I shall not have a minute to spare
Therell be only time to skip home for Aunt Hannah and to pack the
trunks before itll be time to start

Bertram looked at Cyril significantly when this letter was read aloud
and afterward he muttered in Cyrils ear

You see Its Hampden Falls she calls home nownot the Strata

Yes I see frowned Cyril It does look suspicious

Two days before the date of Billys expected sailing William announced
at the breakfast table that he was going away on business might be gone
until the end of the week

You dont say commented Bertram IM going tomorrow but Im coming
back in a couple of days

Hmm murmured William abstractedly Oh well I may be back before
the end of the week

Only one meal did Cyril eat alone after his brothers had gone then he
told Pete that he had decided to take the night boat for New York There
was a little matter that called him there he said and he believed the
trip by water would be a pleasure the night was so fine and warm

In New York Cyril had little trouble in finding Billy as he knew the
steamship she was to take

I thought as long as I was in New York today Id just come and say
goodby to you and Aunt Hannah he informed her with an evident aim
toward making his presence appear to be casual

That was good of you exclaimed Billy And how are Uncle William and
Mr Bertram

Very well I fancy though they werent there when I left replied the
man

Ohgone away

Yes A little matter of business they said butwell by Jove he
broke off his gaze on a familiar figure hurrying at that moment toward
them Theres William now

William with no eyes but for Billy came rapidly forward

Well well Billy I thought as long as I happened to be in New York
today Id just run down to the boat and see you and Aunt Hannah off
and wishCYRIL Where did YOU come from

Billy laughed

He just happened to be in town too Uncle William like you she
explained And Im sure I think its lovely of you to be so kind Aunt
Hannahll be up right away She went down to the stateroom to This
time it was Billy who stopped abruptly The two men facing her could not
see what she saw and not until their brother Bertrams merry greeting
fell on their ears did they understand her sudden silence

And is this the way you meant to run away from us young lady cried
Bertram Not so fast You see I happened to be in New York this
morning and so I Something in Billys face sent a pause to his words
just as his eyes spied the two men at the girls side For a moment he
stared dumbly then he gave a merry gesture of defeat

Its all up I might as well confess IVE been planning this thing for
three weeks Billy ever since your letter came in fact As for my two
fellowsinners here Ill wager they werent two days behind me in their
planning So now own up boys

William and Cyril however did not have to own up Mrs Stetson
appeared at the moment and created for them a very welcome diversion

Long minutes later when the goodbyes had become nothing but a flutter
of white handkerchiefs from deck to shore and shore to deck William
drew a long sigh

Thats a nice little girl boys a nice little girl he exclaimed I
declare I didnt suppose Id mind so much her going so far away



CHAPTER XX

BILLY THE MYTH


To all appearances it came about very naturally that Billy did
not return to America for some time During the summer she wrote
occasionally to William and gave glowing accounts of their travels
Then in September came the letter telling him that they had concluded to
stay through the winter in Paris Billy wrote that she had decided not
to go to college She would take up some studies there in Paris she
said but she would devote herself more particularly to her music

When the next summer came there was still something other than America
to claim her attention the Calderwells had invited her to cruise with
them for three months Their yacht was a little floating palace of
delight Billy declared not to mention the charm of the unknown lands
and waters that she and Aunt Hannah would see

Of all this Billy wrote to Williamat occasional intervalsbut she did
not come home Even when the next autumn came there was still Paris to
detain her for another long winter of study

In the Henshaw house on Beacon Street William mourned not a little as
each recurring season brought no Billy

The idea Its just as if one didnt have a namesake he fumed

Well did you have one Bertram demanded one day Really Will Im
beginning to think shes a myth Long years ago from the first of
April till June we did have two frolicsome sprites here that announced
themselves as Billy and Spunk Ill own And a year later by ways
devious and secret we three managed to see the one called Billy off
on a great steamship Since then what A worda messagea scrap of
paper Billys a myth I say

William sighed

Sometimes I dont know but you are right he admitted Why itll
be three years next June since Billy was here She must be nearly
twentyoneand we know almost nothing about her

Thats so I wonder Bertram paused and laughed a little I wonder
if NOW shed play guardian angel to me through the streets of Boston

William threw a keen glance into his brothers face

I dont believe it would be quite necessary NOW Bert he said
quietly

The other flushed a little but his eyes softened

Maybe not Will stillone can always find some use fora guardian
angel you know he finished almost under his breath

To Cyril Bertram had occasionally spoken during the last two years
of their first suspicions concerning Billys absence They speculated
vaguely too as to why she had gone and if she would ever come back
and they wondered if anything could have wounded her and sent her away
To William they said nothing of all this however though they agreed
that they would have asked Kate for her opinion had she been there
But Kate was not there As it chanced a good business opportunity had
called Kates husband to a Western town very soon after Billy herself
had gone to Hampden Falls and since the familys removal to the West
Mrs Hartwell had not once returned to Boston

It was in April three years since Billys first appearance in the
Beacon Street house that Bertram met his friend Hugh Calderwell on
the street one afternoon and brought him home to dinner

Hugh Calderwell was a youth who Bertram said had been born with a
whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth And indeed it would seem so
if present prosperity were any indication He was a goodlooking young
fellow with a frank manliness that appealed to men and a deferential
chivalry that appealed to women a combination that brought him many
friendsand some enemies With plenty of money to indulge a passion
for traveling young Calderwell had spent the most of his time since
graduation in daring trips into the heart of almost impenetrable
forests or to the top of almost inaccessible mountains with an
occasional more ordinary trip to give variety He had now come to the
point however where he was determined to settle down to something
that meant something he told the Henshaws as the four men smoked in
Bertrams den after dinner

Yes sir I have he iterated And by the way the little girl
that has set me to thinking in such good earnest is a friend of yours
tooMiss Neilson I met her in Paris She was on our yacht all last
summer

Three men sat suddenly erect in their chairs

Billy cried three voices Do you know Billy

To be sure And you do too she says

Oh no we dont disputed Bertram emphatically But we WISH we
did

His guest laughed

Well I fancy you DO know her or you wouldnt have answered like
that he retorted For you just begin to know Miss Billy when you find
out that you DONT know her She is a charming girla very charming
girl

She is my namesake announced William in what Bertram called his
finest ever voice that he used only for the choicest bits in his
collections

Yes she told me smiled Calderwell Billy for William Odd
idea too but clever It helps to distinguish her even morethough she
doesnt need it for that matter

Doesnt need it echoed William in a puzzled voice

No Perhaps you dont know Mr Henshaw but Miss Billy is a very
popular young woman You have reason to be proud of your namesake

I have always been that declared William with just a touch of
hauteur

Tell us about her begged Bertram You remember I said that we wished
we did know her

Calderwell smiled

I dont believe after all that you do know much about her he began
musingly Billy is not one who talks much of herself I fancy in her
letters

William frowned This time there was more than a touch of hauteur in his
voice

MISS NEILSON is not one to show vanity anywhere he said with
suggestive emphasis on the name

Indeed she isnt agreed Calderwell heartily She is a fine
girlquite one of the finest I know in fact

There was an uncomfortable silence Over in the corner Cyril puffed at
his cigar with an air almost of boredom He had not spoken since his
first surprised questioning with the others Do you know Billy
William was still frowning Even Bertram wore a look that was not quite
satisfied

Miss Neilson has spent two winters in Paris now you know resumed
Calderwell after a moment and she is very popular both with
the American colony and with the other students As for her Aunt
Hannahthey all make a pet of her but that is perhaps because Billy
herself is so devoted

Again William frowned at the familiar Billy but Calderwell talked on
unheeding

After all Im not sure but some of us regard Aunt Hannah with scant
favor occasionally he laughed something as if she were the dragon
that guarded the princess you know Miss Billy IS popular with the men
and she has suitors enough to turn any girls headbut her own

Suitors cried William plainly aghast Why Billys nothing but a
child

Calderwell gave an odd smile

How long is it since youve seenMiss Neilson he asked

Two years

And then only for a few minutes just before she sailed amended
Bertram We havent really seen much of her since three years ago

Hmm well youll see for yourself soon You know shes coming home
next month

Not one of the brothers did know itbut not one of them intended that
Calderwell should find out that they did not

Yes shes coming home said William lifting his chin a little

Oh yes next month added Bertram nonchalantly

Even Cyril across the room was not to be outdone

Yes Miss Neilson comes home next month he said



CHAPTER XXI

BILLY THE REALITY


Very early in May came the cheery letter from Billy herself announcing
the news of her intended return

And I shall be so glad to see you all she wrote in closing It seems
so long since I left America Then she signed her name with kindest
regards to allBilly did not send love to all any more

William at once began to make plans for his namesakes comfort

But Will she didnt say she was coming here Bertram reminded him

She didnt need to smiled William confidently She just took it for
granted of course This is her home

But it hasnt beenfor years Shes called Hampden Falls home

I know but that was before demurred William his eyes a little
anxious Besides theyve sold the house now you know Theres nowhere
for her to go but here Bertram

All right acquiesced the younger man still doubtingly Maybe thats
so maybe But he did not finish his sentence and his eyes were
troubled as he watched his brother begin to rearrange Billys rooms
In time however so sure was William of Billys return to the Beacon
Street house that Bertram ceased to question and with almost as much
confidence as William himself displayed he devoted his energies to the
preparations for Billys arrival

And what preparations they were Even Cyril helped this time to the
extent of placing on Billys piano a copy of his latest book and a pile
of new music Nor were the melodies that floated down from the upper
floor akin to funeral marches they were perilously near to being allied
to ragtime

At last everything was ready There was not one more bit of dust to
catch Petes eye nor one more adornment that demanded Williams careful
hand to adjust In Billys rooms new curtains graced the windows and new
rugs the floors In Mrs Stetsons too similar changes had been made
The latest and best Face of a Girl smiled at one from above
Billys piano and the very rarest of Williams treasures adorned the
mantelpiece No guns nor knives nor fishingrods met the eyes now
Instead at every turn there was a hint of feminine tastes a mirror a
workbasket a low sewingchair a stand with a tea tray And everywhere
were roses upstairs and downstairs until the air was heavy with
their perfume In the diningroom Pete was again swinging back and
forth like a pendulum it is true but it was a cheerful pendulum
today anxious only that no time should be lost In the kitchen alone
was there unhappiness and there because Dong Ling had already spoiled
a whole cake of chocolate in a vain attempt to make Billys favorite
fudge Even Spunkie grown now to be sleek lazy and majestically
indifferent was in holiday attire for a brandnew pink bow of huge
dimensions adorned his fat neckfor the first time in many months

You see William had explained to Bertram I put on that ribbon again
because I thought it would make Spunkie seem more homelike and more
like Spunk You know there wasnt anything Billy missed so much as that
kitten when she went abroad Aunt Hannah said so

Yes I know Bertram had laughed but still Spunkie isnt Spunk you
understand he had finished with a vision in his eyes of Billy as she
had looked that first night when she had triumphantly lifted from the
green basket the little gray kitten with its enormous pink bow This
time there was no circuitous journeying no secrecy in the trip to New
York Quite as a matter of course the three brother made their plans to
meet Billy and quite as a matter of course they met her Perhaps
the only cloud in the horizon of their happiness was the presence
of Calderwell He too had come to meet Billyand all the Henshaw
brothers were vaguely conscious of a growing feeling of dislike toward
Calderwell

Billy was unmistakably glad to see themand to see Calderwell It was
while she was talking to Calderwell indeed that William and Cyril and
Bertram had an opportunity really to see the girl and to note what time
had done for her They knew then at once that time had been very kind

It was a slim Billy that they saw with a head royally poised and a
chin that was round and soft and yet knew well its own mind The eyes
were still appealing in a way yet behind the appeal lay unsounded
depths ofnot one of the brothers could quite make up his mind just
what yet all the brothers determined to find out The hair still curled
distractingly behind the pretty ears and fluffed into burnished bronze
where the wind had loosened it The cheeks were paler now though the
roseflush still glowed warmly through the clear smooth skin The
mouthBillys mouth had always been fascinating Bertram suddenly
decided as he watched it now He wanted to paint itagain It was not
too large for beauty nor too small for strength It curved delightfully
and the lower lip had just the fullness and the color that he likedto
paint he said to himself

William too was watching Billys mouth in factthough he did not
know itone never was long near Billy without noticing her mouth if
she talked William thought it pretty merry and charmingly kissable
but just now he wished that it would talk to him and not to Calderwell
any longer Cyrilindeed Cyril was paying little attention to Billy
He had turned to Aunt Hannah To tell the truth it seemed to Cyril
that after all Billy was very much like other merry thoughtless
rather noisy young women of whom he knewand dislikedscores It had
occurred to him suddenly that perhaps it would not be unalloyed bliss to
take this young namesake of Williams home with them

It was not until an hour later when Billy Aunt Hannah and the
Henshaws had reached the hotel where they were to spend the night that
the Henshaw brothers began really to get acquainted with Billy She
seemed then more like their own Billythe Billy that they had known

And Im so glad to be here she cried and to see you all America IS
the best place after all

And of America Boston is the Hub you know Bertram reminded her

It is nodded Billy

And it hasnt changed a mite except to grow better Youll see
tomorrow

As if I hadnt been counting the days she exulted And now what have
you been doingall of you

Just wait till you see laughed Bertram Theyre all spread out for
your inspection

A new Face of a Girl

Of courseyards of them

And heaps of Old Blues and black basalts she questioned turning
to William

Well afew hesitated William modestly

Andthe music what of that Billy looked now at Cyril

Youll see he shrugged Theres very little after allof
anything

Billy gave a wise shake of her head

I know better and I want to see it all so much Weve talked and
talked of it havent we Aunt Hannahof what we would do when we got
to Boston

Yes my dear YOU have

The girl laughed

I accept the amendment she retorted with mock submission I suppose
it is always I who talk

It waswhen I painted you teased Bertram By the way Ill LET you
talk if youll pose again for me he finished eagerly

Billy uptilted her nose

Do you think sir you deserve it after that speech she demanded

But how about YOUR artyour music entreated William You have said
so little of that in your letters

Billy hesitated For a brief moment she glanced at Cyril He did not
appear to have heard his brothers question He was talking with Aunt
Hannah

Oh I playsome murmured the girl almost evasively But tell me of
yourself Uncle William and of what you are doing And William needed
no second bidding

It was some time later that Billy turned to him with an amazed
exclamation in response to something he had said

Home with you Why Uncle William what do you mean You didnt really
think youd got to be troubled with ME any longer she cried merrily

Williams face paled then flushed

I did not call it trouble Billy he said quietly His grieved eyes
looked straight into hers and drove the merriment quite away

Oh Im so sorry she said gently And I appreciate your kindness
indeed I do but I couldntreally I couldnt think of such a thing

And you dont have to think of it cut in Bertram who considered that
the situation was becoming much too serious All you have to do is to
come

Billy shook her head

You are so good all of you But you didntyou really didnt think I
WAScoming she protested

Indeed we did asserted Bertram promptly and we have done
everything to get ready for you too even to rigging up Spunkie to
masquerade as Spunk Ill warrant that Petes nose is already flattened
against the windowpane lest we should HAPPEN to come tonight and
theres no telling how many cakes of chocolate Dong Ling has spoiled by
this time We left him trying to make fudge you know

Billy laughedbut she cried too at least her eyes grew suddenly
moist Bertram tried to decide afterward whether she laughed till she
cried or cried till she laughed

No no she demurred tremulously I couldnt I really have never
intended that

But why not What are you going to do questioned William in a voice
that was dazed and hurt

The first question Billy ignored The second she answered with a
promptness and a gayety that was meant to turn the thoughts away from
the first

We are going to Boston Aunt Hannah and I Weve got rooms engaged
for just now but later were going to take a house and live together
Thats what were going to do



CHAPTER XXII

HUGH CALDERWELL


In the Beacon Street house William mournfully removed the huge pink bow
from Spunkies neck and Bertram threw away the roses Cyril marched
upstairs with his pile of new music and his book and Pete in
obedience to orders hid the workbasket the tea table and the low
sewingchair With a great display of a getting back home air Bertram
moved many of his belongings upstairsbut inside of a week he had moved
them down again saying that after all he believed he liked the first
floor better Billys rooms were closed then and remained as they had
for yearssilent and deserted

Billy with Aunt Hannah had gone directly to their Back Bay hotel This
is for just while Im househunting the girl had said But very soon
she had decided to go to Hampden Falls for the summer and postpone her
housebuying until the autumn Billy was twentyone now and there were
many matters of business to arrange with Lawyer Harding concerning her
inheritance It was not until September therefore when Billy once more
returned to Boston that the Henshaw brothers had the opportunity of
renewing their acquaintance with Williams namesake

I want a home Billy said to Bertram and William on the night of
her arrival As before Mrs Stetson and Billy had gone directly to a
hotel I want a real home with a furnace to shakeif I want toand
some dirt to dig in

Well Im sure that ought to be easy to find smiled Bertram

Oh but that isnt all supplemented Billy It must be mostly closets
and piazza At least those are the important things

Well you might run across a snag there Why dont you build

Billy gave a gesture of dissent

Too slow I want it now

Bertram laughed His eyes narrowed quizzically

From what Calderwell says he bantered I should judge that there are
plenty of sighing swains who are only too ready to give you a homeand
now

The pink deepened in Billys cheeks

I said closets and a piazza dirt to dig and a furnace to shake she
retorted merrily I didnt say I wanted a husband

And you dont of course interposed William decidedly You are much
too young for that

Yes sir agreed Billy demurely but Bertram was sure he saw a twinkle
under the downcast lashes

And where is Cyril asked Mrs Stetson coming into the room at that
moment

William stirred restlessly

Well Cyril couldntcouldnt come stammered William with an uneasy
glance at his brother

Billy laughed unexpectedly

Its too badabout Mr Cyrils not coming she murmured And again
Bertram caught the twinkle in the downcast eyes

To Bertram the twinkle looked interesting and worth pursuit but at
the very beginning of the chase Calderwells card came up and that
endedeverything so Bertram declared crossly to himself

Billy found her dirt to dig in and her furnace to shake in Brookline
There were closets too and a generous expanse of veranda They all
belonged to a quaint little house perched on the side of Corey Hill
From the veranda in the rear and from many of the windows one looked
out upon a delightful view of manyhued manyshaped roofs nestling
among towering trees with the wide sweep of the sky above and the haze
of faraway hills at the horizon

In fact its as nearly perfect as it can beand not take angelwings
and fly away declared Billy I have named it Hillside

Very early in her career as houseowner Billy decided that however
delightful it might be to have a furnace to shake it would not be at
all delightful to shake it besides there was the new motor car to run
Billy therefore sought and found a good strong man who had not only the
muscle and the willingness to shake the furnace but the skill to turn
chauffeur at a moments notice Best of all this man had also a wife
who with a maid to assist her would take full charge of the house and
thus leave Billy and Mrs Stetson free from care All these together
with a canary and a kitten as near like Spunk as could be obtained
made Billys household

And now Im ready to see my friends she announced

And I think your friends will be ready to see you Bertram assured
her

And they wereat least so it appeared For at once the little house
perched on the hillside became the Mecca for many of the Henshaws
friends who had known Billy as Williams merry eighteenyearold
namesake There were others too whom Billy had met abroad and
there were softstepping sweetfaced old women and an occasional
whitewhiskered old manAunt Hannahs friendswho found that the young
mistress of Hillside was a charming hostess There were also the Henshaw
boys and there was always Calderwellat least so Bertram declared
to himself sometimes

Bertram came frequently to the little house on the hill even more
frequently than William but Cyril was not seen there so often He came
once at first it is true and followed Billy from room to room as she
proudly displayed her new home He showed polite interest in her view
and a perfunctory enjoyment of the tea she prepared for him But he
did not come again for some time and when he did come he sat stiffly
silent while his brothers did most of the talking

As to CalderwellCalderwell seemed suddenly to have lost his interest
in impenetrable forests and unclimbable mountains Nothing more
intricate than the long Beacon Street boulevard or more inaccessible
than Corey Hill seemed worth exploring apparently According to
Calderwells own version of it he had settled down he was going
to be something that was something And he did spend sundry of his
morning hours in a Boston law office with ponderous calfbound volumes
spread in imposing array on the desk before him Other hoursmany
hourshe spent with Billy

One day very soon in fact after she arrived in Boston Billy asked
Calderwell about the Henshaws

Tell me about them she said Tell me what they have been doing all
these years

Tell you about them Why dont you know

She shook her head

No Cyril says nothing William little moreabout themselves and you
know what Bertram is One can hardly separate sense from nonsense with
him

You dont know then how splendidly Bertram has done with his art

No only from the most casual hearsay Has he done well then

Finely The public has been his for years and now the critics
are tumbling over each other to do him honor They rave about his
sensitive brilliant nervous touchwhatever that may be his
marvelous color sense his beauty of line and pose And they quarrel
over whether its realism or idealism that constitutes his charm

Im so glad And is it still the Face of a Girl

Yes only hes doing straight portraiture now as well Its got to be
quite the thing to be done by Henshaw and theres many a fair lady
that has graciously commissioned him to paint her portrait Hes a fine
fellow tooa mighty fine fellow You may not know perhaps but three
or four years ago he waswell not wild but frolicsome he would
probably have called it He got in with a lot of fellows thatwell
that werent good for a chap of Bertrams temperament

LikeMr Seaver

Calderwell turned sharply

Did YOU know Seaver he demanded in obvious surprise

I used to SEE himwith Bertram

Oh Well he WAS one of them unfortunately But Bertram shipped him
years ago

Billy gave a sudden radiant smilebut she changed the subject at once

And Mr William still collects I suppose she observed

Jove I should say he did Ive forgotten the latest but hes a fine
fellow too like Bertram

AndMr Cyril

Calderwell frowned

That chaps a poser for me Billy and no mistake I cant make him
out

Whats the matter

I dont know Probably Im not tuned to his pitch Bertram told me
once that Cyril was very sensitively strung and never responded until
a certain note was struck Well I havent ever found that note I
reckon

Billy laughed

I never heard Bertram say that but I think I know what he means and
hes right too I begin to realize now what a jangling discord I must
have created when I tried to harmonize with him three years ago But
what is he doing in his music

The other shrugged his shoulders

Same thing Plays occasionally and plays well too but hes so
erratic its difficult to get him to do it Everything must be just so
you knowair light piano and audience Hes got another book out
Im tolda profound treatise on somebodys something or othermusical
of course

And he used to write music doesnt he do that any more

I believe so I hear of it occasionally through musical friends of
mine They even play it to me sometimes But I cant stand for much of
ithis stuffreally Billy

Stuff indeed And why not An odd hostility showed in Billys eyes

Again Calderwell shrugged his shoulders

Dont ask me I dont know But theyre always dead slow somber
things with the wail of a lost spirit shrieking through them

But I just love lost spirits that wail avowed Billy with more than a
shade of reproach in her voice

Calderwell stared then he shook his head

Not in mine thank you he retorted whimsically I prefer my spirits
of a more sane and cheerful sort

The girl laughed but almost instantly she fell silent

Ive been wondering she began musingly after a time why some one
of those three men does notmarry

You wouldnt wonderif you knew them better declared Calderwell
Now think Lets begin at the top of the Strataby the way Bertrams
name for that establishment is mighty clever First Cyril according
to Bertram Cyril hates all kinds of women and other confusion and I
fancy Bertram hits it about right So that settles Cyril Then theres
Williamyou know William Any girl would say William was a dear but
William isnt a MARRYING man Dad saysCalderwells voice softened a
littledad says that William and his young wife were the most devoted
couple that he ever saw and that when she died she seemed to take with
her the whole of Williams heartthat is what hadnt gone with the
baby a few years before There was a boy you know that died

Yes I know nodded Billy quick tears in her eyes Aunt Hannah told
me

Well that counts out William then said Calderwell with an air of
finality

But how about Bertram You havent settled Bertram laughed Billy
archly

Bertram Calderwells eyes widened Billy can you imagine Bertrams
making love in real earnest to a girl

Why Idontknow maybe Billy tipped her head from side to side as
if she were viewing a picture set up for her inspection

Well I cant In the first place no girl would think he was serious
or if by any chance she did shed soon discover that it was the turn
of her head or the tilt of her chin that he admiredTO PAINT Now isnt
that so

Billy laughed but she did not answer

It is and you know it declared Calderwell And that settles him
Now you can see perhaps why none of these menwill marry

It was a long minute before Billy spoke

Not a bit of it I dont see it at all she declared with roguish
merriment Moreover I think that some day some one of themwill
marry Sir Doubtful

Calderwell threw a quick glance into her eyes Evidently something he
saw there sent a swift shadow to his own He waited a moment then asked
abruptly

Billy WONT you marry me

Billy frowned though her eyes still laughed

Hugh I told you not to ask me that again she demurred

And I told you not to ask impossibilities of me he retorted
imperturbably Billy wont you nowseriously

Seriously no Hugh Please dont let us go all over that again when
weve done it so many times

No lets dont agreed the man cheerfully And we dont have to
either if youll only say yes now right away without any more
fuss

Billy sighed impatiently

Hugh wont you understand that Im serious she cried then she
turned suddenly with a peculiar flash in her eyes

Hugh I dont believe Bertram himself could make love any more
nonsensically than you can

Calderwell laughed but he frowned too and again he threw into
Billys face that keenly questioning glance He said somethinga light
somethingthat brought the laugh to Billys lips in spite of herself
but he was still frowning when he left the house some minutes later and
the shadow was not gone from his eyes



CHAPTER XXIII

BERTRAM DOES SOME QUESTIONING


Billys time was well occupied There were so many many things she
wished to do and so few few hours in which to do them First there was
her music She made arrangements at once to study with one of Bostons
best piano teachers and she also made plans to continue her French and
German She joined a musical club a literary club and a more strictly
social club and to numerous church charities and philanthropic
enterprises she lent more than her name giving freely of both time and
money

Friday afternoons of course were to be held sacred to the Symphony
concerts and on certain Wednesday mornings there was to be a series of
recitals in which she was greatly interested

For Society with a capital S Billy cared little but for sociability
with a small s she cared much and very wide she opened her doors to
her friends lavishing upon them a wealth of hospitality Nor did
they all come in carriages or automobilesthese friends A certain
palefaced little widow over at the South End knew just how good Miss
Neilsons tea tasted on a crisp October afternoon and Marie Hawthorn a
frail young woman who gave music lessons knew just how restful was Miss
Neilsons couch after a weary day of long walks and fretful pupils

But how in the world do you discover them allthese forlorn specimens
of humanity queried Bertram one evening when he had found Billy
entertaining a freckledfaced messengerboy with a plate of ice cream
and a big square of cake

Anywhereeverywhere smiled Billy

Well this last candidate for your favor who has just gonewhos he

I dont know beyond that his name is Tom and that he likes ice
cream

And you never saw him before

Never

Humph One wouldnt think it to see his charming air of nonchalant
accustomedness

Oh but it doesnt take much to make a little fellow like that feel at
home laughed Billy

And are you in the habit of feeding every one who comes to your house
on ice cream and chocolate cake I thought that stone doorstep of yours
was looking a little worn

Not a bit of it retorted Billy This little chap came with a message
just as I was finishing dinner The ice cream was particularly good
tonight and it occurred to me that he might like a taste so I gave it
to him

Bertram raised his eyebrows quizzically

Very kind of course butwhy ice cream he questioned I thought it
was roast beef and boiled potatoes that was supposed to be handed out to
gaunteyed hunger

It is nodded Billy and thats why I think sometimes theyd like ice
cream and chocolate frosting Besides to give sugar plums one doesnt
have to unwind yards of red tape or worry about pauperizing the poor
To give red flannels and a ton of coal one must be properly circumspect
and consult records and city missionaries of course and thats why
its such a relief sometimes just to hand over a simple little sugar
plum and see them smile

For a minute Bertram was silent then he asked abruptly

Billy why did you leave the Strata

Billy was taken quite by surprise A pink flush spread to her forehead
and her tongue stumbled at first over her reply

Why Iit seemedyouwhy I left to go to Hampden Falls to be sure
Dont you remember she finished gaily

Oh yes I remember THAT conceded Bertram with disdainful emphasis
But why did you go to Hampden Falls

Why itit was the only place to gothat is I WANTED to go there
she corrected hastily Didnt Aunt Hannah tell you that II was
homesick to get back there

Oh yes Aunt Hannah SAID that observed the man but wasnt that
homesickness a littlesudden

Billy blushed pink again

Why maybe butwell homesickness is always more or less sudden
isnt it she parried

Bertram laughed but his eyes grew suddenly almost tender

See here Billy you cant bluff worth a cent he declared You are
much too refreshingly frank for that Something was the trouble Now
what was it Wont you tell me please

Billy pouted She hesitated and gazed anywhere but into the challenging
eyes before her Then very suddenly she looked straight into them

Very well there WAS a reason for my leaving she confessed a little
breathlessly Ididnt want tobother you any moreall of you

Bother us

No I found out You couldnt paint Mr Cyril couldnt play or write
andand everything was different because I was there But I didnt
blame youno no she assured him hastily It was only that Ifound
out

And may I ask HOW you obtained this most extraordinary information
demanded Bertram savagely

Billy shook her head Her round little chin looked suddenly square and
determined

You may ask but I shall not tell she declared firmly

If Bertram had known Billy just a little better he would have let the
matter drop there but he did not know Billy so he asked

Was it anything I didor said

The girl did not answer

Billy was it Bertrams voice showed terror now

Billy laughed unexpectedly

Do you think Im going to say no to a series of questions and then
give the whole thing away by my silence when you come to the right one
she demanded merrily No sir

Well anyhow it wasnt I then sighed the man in relief for
you just observed that you were not going to say no to a series of
questionsand that was the first one So Ive found out that much
anyhow he concluded triumphantly

The girl eyed him for a moment in silence then she shook her head

Im not going to be caught that way either she smiled You
knowjust what you did in the first place about it nothing

The man stirred restlessly and pondered After a long pause he adopted
new tactics With a searching study of her face to note the slightest
change he enumerated

Was it Cyril then Will Aunt Hannah Kate It couldnt have been
Pete or Dong Ling

Billy still smiled inscrutably At no name had Bertram detected so
much as the flicker of an eyelid and with a glance halfadmiring
halfchagrined he fell back into his chair

Ill give it up Youve won he acknowledged But Billyhis
manner changed suddenlyI wonder if you know just what a hole you left
in the Strata when you went away

But I couldnt havein the whole Strata objected Billy I occupied
only one stratum and a stratum doesnt go up and down you know only
across and mine was the second floor

Bertram gave a slow shake of his head

I know but yours was a freak formation he maintained gravely It
DID go up and down Honestly Billy we did carelots Will and I were
inconsolable and even Cyril played dirges for a week

Did he gurgled Billy with sudden joyousness Im so glad

Thank you murmured Bertram disapprovingly We hadnt considered it
a subject for exultation

What Oh I didnt mean that That is she stopped helplessly

Oh never mind about trying to explain interposed Bertram I fancy
the remedy would be worse than the disease in this case

Nonsense I only meant that I like to be missedsometimes retorted
Billy a little nettled

And you rejoice then to have me mope Cyril play dirges and Will
wander mournfully about the house with Spunkie in his arms You should
have seen William If his forlornness did not bring tears to your eyes
the grace of the pink bow that lopped behind Spunkies left ear would
surely have brought a copious flow

Billy laughed but her eyes grew tender

Did Uncle William dothat she asked

He didand he did more Pete told me after a time that you had
not left one thing in the house anywhere but one day over behind
Williams most treasured Lowestoft I found a small shell hairpin and
a flat brown silk button that I recognized as coming from one of your
dresses

Oh said Billy softly Dear Uncle Williamand how good he was to
me



CHAPTER XXIV

CYRIL THE ENIGMA


Perhaps it was because Billy saw so little of Cyril that it was Cyril
whom she wished particularly to see William Bertram Calderwellall
her other friends came frequently to the little house on the hill Billy
told herself only Cyril held aloofand it was Cyril that she wanted

Billy said that it was his music that she wanted to hear him play and
that she wanted him to hear her She felt grieved and chagrined Not
once since she had come had he seemed interestedreally interested in
her music He had asked her it is true in a perfunctory way what
she had done and who her teachers had been But all the while she was
answering she had felt that he was not listening that he did not care
And she cared so much She knew now that all her practising through
the long hard months of study had been for Cyril Every scale had been
smoothed for his ears and every phrase had been interpreted with his
approbation in view Across the wide waste of waters his face had shone
like a star of promise beckoning her on and on to heights unknown
And now she was here in Boston but she could not even play the
scale nor interpret the phrase for the ear to which they had been so
laboriously attuned and Cyrils face in the flesh was no beckoning
star of promise but was a thing as cold and relentless as was the waste
of waters across which it had shone in the past

Billy did not understand it She knew it is true of Cyrils reputed
aversion to women in general and to noise but she was neither women in
general nor noise she told herself indignantly She was only the little
maid grown three years older who had sat at his feet and adoringly
listened to all that he had been pleased to say in the old days at the
top of the Strata And he had been kind thenvery kind Billy declared
stoutly He had been patient and interested too and he had seemed not
only willing but glad to teach her while now

Sometimes Billy thought she would ask him candidly what was the matter
But it was always the old frank Billy that thought this the impulsive
Billy that had gone up to Cyrils rooms years before and cheerfully
announced that she had come to get acquainted It was never the
sensible circumspect Billy that Aunt Hannah had for three years
been shaping and coaxing into being But even this Billy frowned
rebelliously and declared that sometime something should be said that
would at least give him a chance to explain

In all the weeks since Billys purchase of Hillside Cyril had been
there only twice and it was nearly Thanksgiving now Billy had seen
him once or twice also at the Beacon Street house when she and Aunt
Hannah had dined there but on all these occasions he had been either
the coldly reserved guest or the painfully punctilious host Never had
he been in the least approachable

He treats me exactly as he treated poor little Spunk that first night
Billy declared hotly to herself

Only once since she came had Billy heard Cyril play and that was
when she had shared the privilege with hundreds of others at a public
concert She had sat then entranced with her eyes on the cleancut
handsome profile of the man who played with so sure a skill and power
yet without a note before him Afterward she had met him face to face
and had tried to tell him how moved she was but in her agitation and
because of a strange shyness that had suddenly come to her she had
ended only in stammering out some flippant banality that had brought to
his face merely a bored smile of acknowledgment

Twice she had asked him to play for her but each time he had begged to
be excused courteously but decidedly

Its no use to tease Bertram had interposed once with an airy wave
of his hands This lion always did refuse to roar to order If you
really must hear him youll have to slip upstairs and camp outside his
door waiting patiently for such crumbs as may fall from his table

Arent your metaphors a little mixed questioned Cyril irritably

Yes sir acknowledged Bertram with unruffled temper but I dont
mind if Billy doesnt I only meant her to understand that shed have to
do as she used to dolisten outside your door

Billys cheeks reddened

But that is what I shant do she retorted with spirit And
moreover I still have hopes that some day hell play to me

Maybe conceded Bertram doubtfully if the stool and the piano and
the pedals and the weather and his fingers and your ears and my watch
are all just rightthen hell play

Nonsense scowled Cyril Ill play of course some day But Id
rather not today And there the matter had ended Since then Billy had
not asked him to play



CHAPTER XXV

THE OLD ROOMAND BILLY


Thanksgiving was to be a great day in the Henshaw family The Henshaw
brothers were to entertain Billy and Aunt Hannah had been invited to
dinner and so joyously hospitable was Williams invitation that it
would have included the new kitten and the canary if Billy would have
consented to bring them

Once more Pete swept and garnished the house and once more Dong Ling
spoiled uncounted squares of chocolate trying to make the baffling
fudge Bertram said that the entire Strata was aquiver Not but that
Billy and Aunt Hannah had visited there before but that this was
different They were to come at noon this time This visit was not to be
a tantalizing little piece of stiffness an hour and a half long It was
to be a satisfying wholesouled matter of half a days comradeship
almost like old times So once more the roses graced the rooms and
a flaring pink bow adorned Spunkies fat neck and once more Bertram
placed his latest Face of a Girl in the best possible light There was
still a difference however for this time Cyril did not bring any music
down to the piano nor display anywhere a copy of his newest book

The dinner was to be at three oclock but by special invitation the
guests were to arrive at twelve and promptly at the appointed hour they
came

There this is something like exulted Bertram when the ladies
divested of their wraps toasted their feet before the open fire in his
den

Indeed it is for now Ive time to see everythingeverything youve
done since Ive been gone cried Billy gazing eagerly about her

Hmm well THAT wasnt what I meant shrugged Bertram

Of course not but its what I meant retorted Billy And there are
other things too I expect there are half a dozen new Old Blues and
black basalts that I want to see eh Uncle William she finished
smiling into the eyes of the man who had been gazing at her with doting
pride for the last five minutes

Ho Will isnt on teapots now quoth Bertram before his brother had
a chance to reply You might dangle the oldest Old Blue that ever was
before him now and hed pay scant attention if he happened at the same
time to get his eyes on some old pewter chain with a green stone in it

Billy laughed but at the look of genuine distress that came into
Williams face she sobered at once

Dont you let him tease you Uncle William she said quickly
Im sure pewter chains with green stones in them sound just awfully
interesting and I want to see them right away now Come she finished
springing to her feet take me upstairs please and show them to me

William shook his head and said No no protesting that what he had
were scarcely worth her attention but even while he talked he rose to
his feet and advanced half eagerly half reluctantly toward the door

Nonsense said Billy fondly as she laid her hand on his arm I know
they are very much worth seeing Come And she led the way from the
room Oh oh she exclaimed a few moments later as she stood before a
small cabinet in one of Williams rooms Oh oh how pretty

Do you like them I thought you would triumphed William quick joy
driving away the anxious fear in his eyes You see II thought of
you when I got themevery one of them I thought youd like them But
I havent very many yet of course This is the latest one And he
tenderly lifted from its black velvet mat a curious silver necklace made
of small flat chainlinked disks heavily chased and set at regular
intervals with a strange bluegreen stone

Billy hung above it enraptured

Oh what a beauty And this I suppose is Bertrams pewter chain
Pewter indeed she scoffed Tell me Uncle William where did you
get it

And uncle William told happily thirstily drinking in Billys evident
interest with delight There were too a quaintlyset ring and a
catseye brooch and to each belonged a story which William was
equally glad to tell There were other treasures also buckles rings
brooches and necklaces some of dull gold some of equally dull silver
but all of odd design and curious workmanship studded here and there
with bits of red green yellow blue and flamecolored stones Very
learnedly then from Williams lips fell the new vocabulary that had come
to him with his latest treasures chrysoprase carnelian girasol onyx
plasma sardonyx lapis lazuli tourmaline chrysolite hyacinth and
carbuncle

They are lovely perfectly lovely breathed Billy when the last chain
had slipped through her fingers into Williams hand I think they are
the very nicest things you ever collected

So do I agreed the man emphatically And they aredifferent too

They are said Billy verydifferent But she was not looking at
the jewelry her eyes were on a small shell hairpin and a brown silk
button half hidden behind a Lowestoft teapot

On the way downstairs William stopped a moment at Billys old rooms

I wish you were here now he said wistfully Theyre all ready for
youthese rooms

Oh but why dont you use themsuch pretty rooms cried Billy
quickly

William gave a gesture of dissent

We have no use for them besides they belong to you and Aunt Hannah
You left your imprint long ago my dearwe should not feel at home in
them

Oh but you should You mustnt feel like that objected Billy
hurriedly crossing the room to the window to hide a sudden nervousness
that had assailed her And heres my piano too and open she
finished gaily dropping herself upon the piano stool and dashing into a
brilliant mazourka

Billy like Cyril had a way of working off her moods at her finger
tips and today the tripping notes and crashing chords told of a
nervous excitement that was not all joy From the doorway William
watched her flying fingers with fond pride and it was very reluctantly
that he acceded to Petes request to go downstairs for a moment to
settle a vexed question concerning the table decorations

Billy left alone still played but with a difference The tripping
notes slowed into a weird melody that rose and fell and lost itself in
the exquisite harmony that had been born of the crashing chords Billy
was improvising now and into her music had crept something of her
oldtime longing when she had come to that house a lonely orphan girl
in search of a home On and on she played then with a discordant
note she suddenly rose from the piano She was thinking of Kate and
wondering if had Kate not managed the little room would still be
home

So swiftly did Billy cross to the door that the man on the stairs
outside had not time to get quite out of sight Billy did not see his
face however she saw only a pair of graytrousered legs disappearing
around the curve of the landing above She thought nothing of it until
later when dinner was announced and Cyril came downstairs then
she saw that he and he only that afternoon wore trousers of that
particular shade of gray

The dinner was a great success Even the chocolate fudge in the little
cut glass bonbon dishes was perfect and it was a question whether Pete
or Dong Ling tried the harder to please

After dinner the family gathered in the drawingroom and chatted
pleasantly Bertram displayed his prettiest and newest pictures and
Billy played and sungbright tuneful little things that she knew Aunt
Hannah and Uncle William liked If Cyril was pleased or displeased he
did not show itbut Billy had ceased to play for Cyrils ears She told
herself that she did not care but she did wonder was that Cyril on the
stairs and if sowhat was he doing there



CHAPTER XXVI

MUSIC HATH CHARMS


Two days after Thanksgiving Cyril called at Hillside

Ive come to hear you play he announced abruptly

Billys heart sung within herbut her temper rose Did he think then
that he had but to beckon and she would comeand at this late day she
asked herself Aloud she said

Play But this is so sudden Besides you have heard me

The man made a disdainful gesture

Not that I mean playreally play Billy why havent you played to me
before

Billys chin rose perceptibly

Why havent you asked me she parried

To Billys surprise the man answered this with calm directness

Because Calderwell said that you were a dandy player and I dont care
for dandy players

Billy laughed now

And how do you know Im not a dandy player Sir Impertinent she
demanded

Because Ive heard youwhen you werent

Thank you murmured Billy

Cyril shrugged his shoulders

Oh you know very well what I mean he defended Ive heard you
thats all

When

That doesnt signify

Billy was silent for a moment her eyes gravely studying his face Then
she asked

Were you longon that stairway

Eh What Oh Cyrils forehead grew suddenly pink Well he finished
a little aggressively

Oh nothing smiled the girl Of course people who live in glass
houses must not throw stones

Very well then I did listen acknowledged the man testily I liked
what you were playing I hoped downstairs later that youd play it
again but you didnt I came today to hear it

Again Billys heart sung within herbut again her temper rose too

I dont think I feel like it she said sweetly with a shake of her
head Not today

For a brief moment Cyril stared frowningly then his face lighted with
his rare smile

Im fairly checkmated he said rising to his feet and going straight
to the piano

For long minutes he played modulating from one enchanting composition
to another and finishing with the one all chords with big bass notes
that marched on and onthe one Billy had sat long ago on the stairs to
hear

There Now will you play for me he asked rising to his feet and
turning reproachful eyes upon her

Billy too rose to her feet Her face was flushed and her eyes were
shining Her lips quivered with emotion As was always the case Cyrils
music had carried her quite out of herself

Oh thank you thank you she sighed You dont knowyou cant know
how beautiful it all isto me

Thank you Then surely now youll play to me he returned

A look of real distress came to Billys face

But I cantnot what you heard the other day she cried remorsefully
You see I wasonly improvising

Cyril turned quickly

Only improvising Billy did you ever write it downany of your
improvising

An embarrassed red flew to Billys face

Notnot that amounted towell that is somea little she
stammered

Let me see it

No no I couldntnot YOU

Again the rare smile lighted Cyrils eyes

Billy let me see that paperplease

Very slowly the girl turned toward the music cabinet She hesitated
glanced once more appealingly into Cyrils face then with nervous haste
opened the little mahogany door and took from one of the shelves a sheet
of manuscript music But like a shy child with her first copy book she
held it half behind her back as she came toward the piano

Thank you said Cyril as he reached far out for the music The next
moment he seated himself again at the piano

Twice he played the little song through carefully slowly

Now sing it he directed

Falteringly in a very faint voice and with very many breaths taken
where they should not have been taken Billy obeyed

When we want to show off your song Billy we wont ask you to sing
it observed the man dryly when she had finished

Billy laughed and dimpled into a blush

When I want to show off my song I shant be singing it to you for the
first time she pouted

Cyril did not answer He was playing over and over certain harmonies in
the music before him

Hmm I see youve studied your counterpoint to some purpose he
vouchsafed finally then Where did you get the words

The girl hesitated The flush had deepened on her face

Well I she stopped and gave an embarrassed laugh Im like the
small boy who made the toys I got them all out of my own head and
theres wood enough to make another

Hmm indeed grunted the man Well have you made any others

Oneor two maybe

Let me see them please

I thinkweve had enoughfor today she faltered

I havent Besides if I could have a couple more to go with this it
would make a very pretty little group of songs

To go with this What do you mean

To the publishers of course

The PUBLISHERS

Certainly Did you think you were going to keep these songs to
yourself

But they arent worth it They cant begood enough Unbelieving joy
was in Billys voice

No Well well let others decide that observed Cyril with a shrug
All is if youve got any more woodlike thisI advise you to make it
up right away

But I have already cried the girl excitedly There are lots of
little things that Ivethat is there aresome she corrected
hastily at the look that sprang into Cyrils eyes

Oh there are laughed Cyril Well well see what But he did
not see He did not even finish his sentence for Billys maid Rosa
appeared just then with a card

Show Mr Calderwell in here said Billy Cyril said nothingaloud
which was well His thoughts just then were better left unspoken



CHAPTER XXVII

MARIE WHO LONGS TO MAKE PUDDINGS


Wonderful days came then to Billy Four songs it seemed had been
pronounced by competent critics decidedly worth itunmistakably good
enough and they were to be brought out as soon as possible

Of course you understand explained Cyril that theres no hit
expected Thank heaven they arent that sort And theres no great money
in it either Youd have to write a masterpiece like Shes my JuJu
Baby or some such gem to get the hit and the money But the songs are
fine and theyll take with cultured hearers Well get them introduced
by good singers of course and theyll be favorites soon for the
concert stage and for parlors

Billy saw a good deal of Cyril now Already she was at work rewriting
and polishing some of her halfcompleted melodies and Cyril was helping
her by his interest as well as by his criticism He was in fact
at the house very frequentlytoo frequently indeed to suit either
Bertram or Calderwell Even William frowned sometimes when his cozy
chats with Billy were interrupted by Cyrils appearing with a roll of
new music for her to try though William told himself that he ought
to be thankful if there was anything that could make Cyril more
companionable less reserved and morose And Cyril WAS differentthere
was no disputing that Calderwell said that he had come out of his
shell and Bertram told Billy that she must have found his note and
struck it good and hard

Billy was very happy To the little music teacher Marie Hawthorn she
talked more freely perhaps than she did to any one else

Its so wonderful Marieso wonderfully wonderful she said one
day to sit here in my own room and sing a little song that comes from
somewhere anywhere out of the sky itself Then by and by that little
song will fly away away over land and sea and some day it will touch
somebodys heart just as it has touched mine Oh Marie is it not
wonderful

It is dearand it is not Your songs could not help reaching
somebodys heart Theres nothing wonderful in that

Sweet flatterer

But I mean it They are beautiful and so isMr Henshaws music

Yes it is murmured Billy abstractedly

There was a long pause then Marie asked with shy hesitation

Do you think Miss Billythat he would care I listened yesterday when
he was playing to you I was up here in your room but when I heard the
music II went out on the stairs and sat down Was it verybad of
me

Billy laughed happily

If it was he cant say anything she reassured her Hes done the
same thing himselfand so have I

HE has done it

Yes It was at his home last Thanksgiving It was then that he found
outabout my improvising

Ohh Maries eyes were wistful And he cares so much now for your
music

Does he Do you think he does demanded Billy

I know he doesand for the one who makes it too

Nonsense laughed Billy with pinker cheeks Its the music not the
musician that pleases him Mr Cyril doesnt like women

He doesnt like women

No But dont look so shocked my dear Every one who knows Mr Cyril
knows that

But I dont thinkI believe it demurred Marie gazing straight into
Billys eyes Im sure I dont believe it

Under the little music teachers steady gaze Billy flushed again The
laugh she gave was an embarrassed one but through it vibrated a pleased
ring

Nonsense she exclaimed springing to her feet and moving restlessly
about the room With the next breath she had changed the subject to one
far removed from Mr Cyril and his likes and dislikes

Some time later Billy played and it was then that Marie drew a long
sigh

How beautiful it must be to playlike that she breathed

As if you a music teacher could not play laughed Billy

Not like that dear You know it is not like that

Billy frowned

But you are so accurate Marie and you can read at sight so rapidly

Oh yes like a little machine I know scorned the usually gentle
Marie bitterly Dont they have a thing of metal that adds figures
like magic Well Im like that I see g and I play g I see d and I
play d I see f and I play f and after Ive seen enough gs and ds and
fs and played them all the thing is done Ive played

Why Marie Marie my dear The second exclamation was very tender
for Marie was crying

There I knew I should some day have it outall out sobbed Marie I
felt it coming

Then perhaps youllyoull feel better now stammered Billy She
tried to say moreother words that would have been a real comfort but
her tongue refused to speak them She knew so well so woefully well
how very wooden and mechanical the little music teachers playing
always had been But that Marie should realize it herself like thisthe
tragedy of it made Billys heart ache At Maries next words however
Billy caught her breath in surprise

But you see it wasnt musicit wasnt ever music that I wantedto
do she confessed

It wasnt music But whatI dont understand murmured Billy

No I suppose not sighed the other You play so beautifully
yourself

But I thought you loved music

I do I love it dearlyin others But I cantI dont want to make it
myself

But what do you want to do

Marie laughed suddenly

Do you know my dear I have half a mind to tell you what I do like to
dojust to make you stare

Well Billys eyes were wide with interest

I like best of anything todarn stockings and make puddings

Marie

Rank heresy isnt it smiled Marie tearfully But I do truly I
love to weave the threads evenly in and out and see a big hole close
As for the puddings I dont mean the common breadandbutter kind but
the ones that have whites of eggs and fruit and pretty quivery jellies
all ruby and amber lights you know

You dear little piece of domesticity laughed Billy Then why in the
world dont you do these things

I cant in my own kitchen I cant afford a kitchen to do them in And
I just couldnt do themright alongin other peoples kitchens

But why do youplay

I was brought up to it You know we had money once lots of it sighed
Marie as if she were deploring a misfortune And mother was determined
to have me musical Even then as a little tot I liked puddingmaking
and after my mudpie days I was always begging mother to let me go down
into the kitchen to cook But she wouldnt allow it ever She engaged
the most expensive masters and set me practising always practising
I simply had to learn music and I learned it like the adding machine
Then afterward when father died and then mother and the money flew
away why of course I had to do something so naturally I turned to
the music It was all I could do Butwell you know how it is dear I
teach and teach well perhaps so far as the mechanical part goes but
as for the restI am always longing for a cozy corner with a basket of
stockings to mend or a kitchen where there is a pudding waiting to be
made

You poor dear cried Billy Ive a pair of stockings now that needs
attention and Ive been just longing for one of your quivery jellies
all ruby and amber lights ever since you mentioned them Butwell is
there anything I could do to help

Nothing thank you sighed Marie rising wearily to her feet and
covering her eyes with her hand for a moment My head aches shockingly
but Ive got to go this minute and instruct little Jennie Knowls how to
play the wonderful scale of G with a black key in it Besides you do
help me you have helped me you are always helping me dear she added
remorsefully and its wicked of me to make that shadow come to your
eyes Please dont think of it or of me any more And with a
choking little sob she hurried from the room followed by the amazed
questioning sorrowful eyes of Billy



CHAPTER XXVIII

IM GOING TO WIN


Nearly all of Billys friends knew that Bertram Henshaw was in love with
Billy Neilson before Billy herself knew it Not that they regarded it
as anything seriousits only Bertram was still said of him on almost
all occasions But to Bertram himself it was very serious

The world to Bertram indeed had come to assume a vastly different
aspect from what it had displayed in times past Heretofore it had been
a plaything which like a jugglers tinsel ball might be tossed from hand
to hand at will Now it was no playthingno glittering bauble It
was something big and serious and splendidbecause Billy lived in it
something that demanded all his powers to do and bebecause Billy was
watching something that might be a Hades of torment or an Elysium of
blissaccording to whether Billy said no or yes

Since Thanksgiving Bertram had known that it was lovethis consuming
fire within him and since Thanksgiving he had known too that it
was jealousythis fierce hatred of Calderwell He was ashamed of the
hatred He told himself that it was unmanly unkind and unreasonable
and he vowed that he would overcome it At times he even fancied that
he had overcome it but always the sight of Calderwell in Billys little
drawingroom or of even the mans card on Billys silver tray was enough
to show him that he had not

There were others too who annoyed Bertram not a little foremost of
these being his own brothers Still he was not really worried about
William and Cyril he told himself William he did not consider to be a
marrying man and Cyrilevery one knew that Cyril was a womanhater
He was doubtless attracted now only by Billys music There was no
real rivalry to be feared from William and Cyril But there was always
Calderwell and Calderwell was serious Bertram decided therefore
after some weeks of feverish unrest that the only road to peace lay
through a frank avowal of his feelings and a direct appeal to Billy to
give him the great boon of her love

Just here however Bertram met with an unexpected difficulty He could
not find words with which to make his avowal or to present his appeal
He was surprised and annoyed Never before had he been at a loss for
wordsmere words And it was not that he lacked opportunity He
walked drove and talked with Billy and always she was companionable
attentive to what he had to say Never was she cold or reserved Never
did she fail to greet him with a cheery smile

Bertram concluded indeed after a time that she was too companionable
too cheery He wished she would hesitate stammer blush be a
little shy He wished that she would display surprise annoyance
evenanything but that eternal air of comradeship And then one
afternoon in the early twilight of a January day he freed his mind
quite unexpectedly

Billy I wish you WOULDNT be soso friendly he exclaimed in a voice
that was almost sharp

Billy laughed at first but the next moment a shamed distress drove the
merriment quite out of her face

You mean that I presume onon our friendship she stammered That
you fear that I will againshadow your footsteps It was the first
time since the memorable night itself that Billy had ever in Bertrams
presence referred to her young guardianship of his welfare She realized
now suddenly that she had just been giving the man before her some
very sisterly advice and the thought sent a confused red to her
cheeks

Bertram turned quickly

Billy that was the dearest and loveliest thing a girl ever didonly
I was too great a chump to appreciate it finished Bertram in a voice
that was not quite steady

Thank you smiled the girl with a slow shake of her head and a
relieved look in her eyes but Im afraid I cant quite agree to that
The next moment she had demanded mischievously Why then pray this
unflattering objection to myfriendliness now

Because I dont want you for a friend or a sister or anything else
thats related stormed Bertram with sudden vehemence I dont want
you for anything buta wife Billy WONT you marry me

Again Billy laughedlaughed until she saw the pained anger leap to the
gray eyes before her then she became grave at once

Bertram forgive me I didnt think you couldyou cant beserious

But I am

Billy shook her head

But you dont love menot ME Bertram Its only the turn of my head
oror the tilt of my chin that you loveto paint she protested
unconsciously echoing the words Calderwell had said to her weeks before
Im only another Face of a Girl

Youre the only Face of a girl to me now Billy declared the man
with disarming tenderness

No no not that demurred Billy in distress You dont mean it You
only think you do It couldnt be that It cant be

But it is dear I think I have loved you ever since that night long
ago when I saw your dear startled face appealing to me from beyond
Seavers hateful smile And Billy I never went once with Seaver
againanywhere Did you know that

No butIm gladso glad

And Im glad too So you see I must have loved you then though
unconsciously perhaps and I love you now

No no please dont say that It cant beit really cant be II
dont love youthat way Bertram

The man paled a little

Billyforgive me for asking but its so much to meis it that there
issome one else His voice shook

No no indeed There is no one

Its notCalderwell

Billys forehead grew pink She laughed nervously

No no never

But there are others so many others

Nonsense Bertram theres no oneno one I assure you

Its not William of course nor Cyril Cyril hates women

A deeper flush came to Billys face Her chin rose a little and an odd
defiance flashed from her eyes But almost instantly it was gone and a
slow smile had come to her lips

Yes I know Every onesays that Cyril hates women she observed
demurely

Then Billy I shant give up vowed Bertram softly Sometime you
WILL love me

No no I couldnt That is Im not going toto marry stammered
Billy

Not going to marry

No Theres my musicyou know how I love that and how much it is to
me I dont think therell ever be a manthat Ill love better

Bertram lifted his head Very slowly he rose till his splendid six feet
of cleanlimbed strength and manly beauty towered away above the low
chair in which Billy sat His mouth showed new lines about the corners
and his eyes looked down very tenderly at the girl beside him but
his voice when he spoke had a light whimsicality that deceived even
Billys ears

And so its musica cold senseless thing of spidery marks on clean
white paperthat is my only rival he cried Then Ill warn you
Billy Ill warn you Im going to win And with that he was gone



CHAPTER XXIX

IM NOT GOING TO MARRY


Billy did not know whether to be more amazed or amused at Bertrams
proposal of marriage She was vexed she was very sure of that To marry
Bertram Absurd Then she reflected that after all it was only
Bertram so she calmed herself

Still it was annoying She liked Bertram she had always liked him He
was a nice boy and a most congenial companion He never bored her as
did some others and he was always thoughtful of cushions and footstools
and cups of tea when one was tired He was in fact an ideal friend
just the sort she wanted and it was such a pity that he must spoil it
all now with this silly sentimentality And of course he had spoiled it
all There was no going back now to their old friendliness He would be
morose or silly by turns according to whether she frowned or smiled
or else he would take himself off in a tragic sort of way that was very
disturbing He had said to be sure that he would win Win indeed
As if she could marry Bertram When she married her choice would fall
upon a man not a boy a big grave earnest man to whom the world meant
something a man who loved music of course a man who would single her
out from all the world and show to her and to her only the depth
and tenderness of his love a man whobut she was not going to marry
anyway remembered Billy suddenly And with that she began to cry The
whole thing was so tiresome she declared and so absurd

Billy rather dreaded her next meeting with Bertram She fearedshe knew
not what But as it turned out she need not have feared anything for
he met her tranquilly cheerfully as usual and he did nothing and said
nothing that he might not have done and said before that twilight chat
took place

Billy was relieved She concluded that after all Bertram was going
to be sensible She decided that she too would be sensible She would
accept him on this his chosen plane and she would think no more of his
nonsense

Billy threw herself then even more enthusiastically into her beloved
work She told Marie that after all was said and done there could not
be any man that would tip the scales one inch with music on the other
side She was a little hurt it is true when Marie only laughed and
answered

But what if the man and the music both happen to be on the same side
my dear what then

Maries voice was wistful in spite of the laughso wistful that it
reminded Billy of their conversation a few weeks before

But it is you Marie who want the stockings to darn and the puddings
to make she retorted playfully Not I And do you know I believe I
shall turn matchmaker yet and find you a man and the chiefest of his
qualifications shall be that hes wretchedly hard on his hose and that
he adores puddings

No no Miss Billy dont please begged the other in quick terror
Forget all I said the other day please do Dont tellanybody

She was so obviously distressed and frightened that Billy was puzzled

There there twas only a jest of course she soothed her But
really Marie it is the dear domestic little mouse like yourself that
ought to be somebodys wifeand thats the kind men are looking for
too

Marie gave a slow shake of her head

Not the kind of man that is somebody that does something she
objected and thats the only kind I couldlove HE wants a wife that
is beautiful and clever that can do things like himselfLIKE HIMSELF
she iterated feverishly

Billy opened wide her eyes

Why Marie one would thinkyou already knewsuch a man she cried

The little music teacher changed her position and turned her eyes away

I do of course she retorted in a merry voice lots of them Dont
you Come weve discussed my matrimonial prospects quite long enough
she went on lightly You know we started with yours Suppose we go back
to those

But I havent any demurred Billy as she turned with a smile to greet
Aunt Hannah who had just entered the room Im not going to marry am
I Aunt Hannah

Erwhat Marry My grief and conscience what a question Billy
Of course youre going to marrywhen the time comes exclaimed Aunt
Hannah

Billy laughed and shook her head vigorously But even as she opened
her lips to reply Rosa appeared and announced that Mr Calderwell was
waiting downstairs Billy was angry then for after the maid was gone
the merriment in Aunt Hannahs laugh only matched that in Mariesand
the intonation was unmistakable

Well Im not declared Billy with pink cheeks and much indignation
as she left the room And as if to convince herself Marie Aunt Hannah
and all the world that such was the case she refused Calderwell so
decidedly that night when he for the halfdozenth time laid his hand
and heart at her feet that even Calderwell himself was convincedso
far as his own case was concernedand left town the next day

Bertram told Aunt Hannah afterward that he understood Mr Calderwell
had gone to parts unknown To himself Bertram shamelessly owned that the
more unknown they were the better he himself would be pleased



CHAPTER XXX

MARIE FINDS A FRIEND


It was on a very cold January afternoon and Cyril was hurrying up the
hill toward Billys house when he was startled to see a slender young
woman sitting on a curbstone with her head against an electriclight
post He stopped abruptly

I beg your pardon butwhy Miss Hawthorn It is Miss Hawthorn isnt
it

Under his questioning eyes the girls pale face became so painfully
scarlet that in sheer pity the man turned his eyes away He thought he
had seen women blush before but he decided now that he had not

Im surehavent I met you at Miss Neilsons Are you ill Cant I do
something for you he begged

Yesnothat is I AM Miss Hawthorn and Ive met you at Miss
Neilsons stammered the girl faintly But there isnt anything
thank you that you can doMr Henshaw I stopped torest

The man frowned

But surelypardon me Miss Hawthorn but I cant think it your
usual custom to choose an icy curbstone for a resting place with the
thermometer down to zero You must be ill Let me take you to Miss
Neilsons

No no thank you cried the girl struggling to her feet the vivid
red again flooding her face I have a lessonto give

Nonsense Youre not fit to give a lesson Besides they are all
folderol anyway half of them A dozen lessons more or less wont
make any difference theyll play just as welland just as atrociously
Come I insist upon taking you to Miss Neilsons

No no thank you I really mustnt I She could say no more A
strong yet very gentle hand had taken firm hold of her arm in such
a way as half to support her A force quite outside of herself was
carrying her forward step by stepand Miss Hawthorn was not used to
strong gentle hands nor yet to a force quite outside of herself
Neither was she accustomed to walk arm in arm with Mr Cyril Henshaw to
Miss Billys door When she reached there her cheeks were like red roses
for color and her eyes were like the stars for brightness Yet a minute
later confronted by Miss Billys astonished eyes the stars and the
roses fled and a very whitefaced girl fell over in a deathlike faint
in Cyril Henshaws arms

Marie was put to bed in the little room next to Billys and was
peremptorily hushed when faint remonstrance was made The next morning
whitefaced and wideeyed she resolutely pulled herself half upright
and announced that she was all well and must go homehome to Marie was
a sixbynine hall bedroom in a South End lodging house

Very gently Billy pushed her back on the pillow and laid a detaining
hand on her arm

No dear Now please be sensible and listen to reason You are my
guest You did not know it perhaps for Im afraid the invitation got a
little delayed But youre to stayoh lots of weeks

Istay here Why I cantindeed I cant protested Marie

But that isnt a bit of a nice way to accept an invitation
disapproved Billy You should say Thank you Id be delighted Im
sure and Ill stay

In spite of herself the little music teacher laughed and in the laugh
her tense muscles relaxed

Miss Billy Miss Billy what is one to do with you Surely you
knowyou must know that I cant do what you ask

Im sure I dont see why not argued Billy Im merely giving you an
invitation and all you have to do is to accept it

But the invitation is only the kind way your heart has of covering
another of your many charities objected Marie besides I have to
teach I have my living to earn

But you cant demurred the other Thats just the trouble Dont
you see The doctor said last night that you must not teach again this
winter

Not teachagainthis winter No no he could not be so cruel as
that

It wasnt cruel dear it was kind You would be ill if you attempted
it Now youll get better He says all you need is rest and careand
thats exactly what I mean my guest shall have

Quick tears came to the sick girls eyes

There couldnt be a kinder heart than yours Miss Billy she murmured
but I couldntI really couldnt be a burden to you like this I shall
go to some hospital

But you arent going to be a burden You are going to be my friend and
companion

A companionand in bed like this

Well THAT wouldnt be impossible smiled Billy but as it happens
you wont have to put that to the test for youll soon be up and
dressed The doctor says so Now surely you will stay

There was a long pause The little music teachers eyes had left Billys
face and were circling the room wistfully lingering on the hangings of
filmy lace the dainty wall covering and the exquisite water colors in
their whiteandgold frames At last she drew a deep sigh

Yes Ill stay she breathed rapturously butyou must let me help

Help Help what

Help you your letters your musiccopying your accountsanything
everything And if you dont let me helpthe music teachers
voice was very stern nowif you dont let me help I shall go home
justassoonasIcanwalk

Dear me dimpled Billy And is that all Well you shall help and to
your hearts content too In fact Im not at all sure that I shant
keep you darning stockings and making puddings all the time she added
mischievously as she left the room

Miss Hawthorn sat up the next day The day following in one of Billys
fluttery wrappers as she called them she walked all about the room
Very soon she was able to go downstairs and in an astonishingly short
time she fitted into the daily life as if she had always been there She
was moreover of such assistance to Billy that even she herself could
see the value of her work and so she stayed content

The little music teacher saw a good deal of Billys friends then
particularly of the Henshaw brothers and very glad was Billy to see the
comradeship growing between them She had known that William would
be kind to the orphan girl but she had feared that Marie would not
understand Bertrams nonsense or Cyrils reserve But very soon Bertram
had begged and obtained permission to try to reproduce on canvas the
sheen of the fine fair hair and the veiled bloom of the roseleaf skin
that were Maries greatest charms and already Cyril had unbent from his
usual stiffness enough to play to her twice So Billys fears on that
score were at an end



CHAPTER XXXI

THE ENGAGEMENT OF ONE


Many times during those winter days Billy thought of Maries words But
what if the man and the music both happen to be on the same side They
worried her to some extent and curiously they pleased and displeased
her at the same time

She told herself that she knew very well of course what Marie meant
it was Cyril he was the man and the music But was Cyril beginning
to care for her and did she want him to Very seriously one day Billy
asked herself these questions very calmly she argued the matter in her
mindas was Billys way

She was proud certainly of what her influence had apparently done for
Cyril She was gratified that to her he was showing the real depth and
beauty of his nature It WAS flattering to feel that she and only she
had thus won the regard of a professional womanhater Then besides
all this there was his musichis glorious music Think of the bliss
of living ever with that Imagine life with a man whose soul would be so
perfectly attuned to hers that existence would be one grand harmony
Ah that truly would be the ideal marriage But she had planned not to
marry Billy frowned now and tapped her foot nervously It was indeed
most puzzlingthis question and she did not want to make a mistake
Then too she did not wish to wound Cyril If the dear man HAD come
out of his icy prison and were reaching out timid hands to her for
her help her interest her lovethe tragedy of it if he met with
no response This vision of Cyril with outstretched hands and of
herself with cold averted eyes was the last straw in the balance with
Billy She decided suddenly that she did care for Cyrila little and
that she probably could care for him a great deal With this thought
Billy blushedalready in her own mind she was as good as pledged to
Cyril

It was a great change for Billythis sudden leap from girlhood and
irresponsibility to womanhood and care but she took it fearlessly
resolutely If she was to be Cyrils wife she must make herself fit
for itand in pursuance of this high ideal she followed Marie into the
kitchen the very next time the little music teacher went out to make one
of her dainty desserts that the family liked so well

Ill just watch if you dont mind announced Billy

Why of course not smiled Marie but I thought you didnt like to
make puddings

I dont owned Billy cheerfully

Then why thiswatchfulness

Nothing only I thought it might be just as well if I knew how to make
them You know how Cyrilthat is ALL the Henshaw boys like every kind
you make

The egg in Maries hand slipped from her fingers and crashed untidily
on the shelf With a gleeful laugh Billy welcomed the diversion She had
not meant to speak so plainly It was one thing to try to fit herself
to be Cyrils wife and quite another to display those efforts so openly
before the world

The pudding was made at last but Marie proved to be a nervous teacher
Her hand shook and her memory almost failed her at one or two critical
points Billy laughingly said that it must be stage fright owing to
the presence of herself as spectator and with this Marie promptly and
somewhat effusively agreed

So very busy was Billy during the next few days acquiring her new
domesticity that she did not notice how little she was seeing of Cyril
Then she suddenly realized it and asked herself the reason for it
Cyril was at the house certainly just as frequently as he had been but
she saw that a new shyness in herself had developed which was causing
her to be restless in his presence and was leading her to like better
to have Marie or Aunt Hannah in the room when he called She discovered
too that she welcomed William and even Bertram with peculiar
enthusiasmif they happened to interrupt a teteatete with Cyril

Billy was disturbed at this She told herself that this shyness was not
strange perhaps inasmuch as her ideas in regard to love and marriage
had undergone so abrupt a change but it must be overcome If she was to
be Cyrils wife she must like to be with himand of course she really
did like to be with him for she had enjoyed his companionship very
much during all these past weeks She set herself therefore now
determinedly to cultivating Cyril

It was then that Billy made a strange and fearsome discovery there were
some things about Cyril that she didnotlike

Billy was inexpressibly shocked Heretofore he had been so high so
irreproachable so godlikebut heretofore he had been a friend
Now he was appearing in a new rolethough unconsciously she knew
Heretofore she had looked at him with eyes that saw only the delightful
and marvelous unfolding of a coldly reserved nature under the warmth of
her own encouraging smile Now she looked at him with eyes that saw only
the possibilities of that same nature when it should have been unfolded
in a lifelong companionship And what she saw frightened her There was
still the musicshe acknowledged that but it had come to Billy with
overwhelming force that music after all was not everything The man
counted as well Very frankly then Billy stated the case to herself

What passes for fascinating mystery in him now will be plain
morosenesssometime He is taciturn now hell becross then It is
erratic when he wont play the piano today but a few years from now
when he refuses some simple request of mine it will bestubbornness
All this it will beif I dont love him and I dont I know I dont
Besides we arent really congenial I like people around he doesnt
I like to go to plays he doesnt He likes rainy days I abhor them
There is no doubt of itlife with him would not be one grand harmony
it would be one jangling discord I simply cannot marry him I shall
have to break the engagement

Billy spoke with regretful sorrow It was evident that she grieved to
bring pain to Cyril Then suddenly the gloom left her face she had
remembered that the engagement was just three weeks oldand was a
profound secret not only to the bridegroom elect but to all the world
as wellsave herself

Billy was very happy after that She sang about the house all day and
she danced sometimes from room to room so light were her feet and her
heart She made no more puddings with Maries supervision but she was
particularly careful to have the little music teacher or Aunt Hannah
with her when Cyril called She made up her mind it is true that she
had been mistaken and that Cyril did not love her still she wished to
be on the safe side and she became more and more averse to being left
alone with him for any length of time



CHAPTER XXXII

CYRIL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY


Long before spring Billy was forced to own to herself that her fancied
security from lovemaking on the part of Cyril no longer existed She
began to suspect that there was reason for her fears Cyril certainly
was different He was more approachable less reserved even with
Marie and Aunt Hannah He was not nearly so taciturn either and he
was much more gracious about his playing Even Marie dared to ask him
frequently for music and he never refused her request Three times he
had taken Billy to some play that she wanted to see and he had invited
Marie too besides Aunt Hannah which had pleased Billy very much
He had been at the same time so genial and so gallant that Billy had
declared to Marie afterward that he did not seem like himself at all
but like some one else

Marie had disagreed with her it is true and had said stiffly

Im sure I thought he seemed very much like himself But that had not
changed Billys opinion at all

To Billys mind nothing but love could so have softened the stern Cyril
she had known She was therefore all the more careful these days to
avoid a teteatete with him though she was not always successful
particularly owing to Maries unaccountable perverseness in so often
having letters to write or work to do just when Billy most wanted
her to make a safe third with herself and Cyril It was upon such an
occasion after Marie had abruptly left them alone together that Cyril
had observed a little sharply

Billy I wish you wouldnt say again what you said ten minutes ago when
Miss Marie was here

What was that

A very silly reference to that old notion that you and every one else
seem to have that I am a womanhater

Billys heart skipped a beat One thought pounded through her brain and
dinned itself into her earsat all costs Cyril must not be allowed to
say that which she so feared he must be saved from himself

Womanhater Why of course youre a womanhater she cried merrily
Im sure II think its lovely to be a womanhater

The man opened wide his eyes then he frowned angrily

Nonsense Billy I know better Besides Im in earnest and Im not a
womanhater

Oh but every one says you are chattered Billy And after all you
know it IS distinguishing

With a disdainful exclamation the man sprang to his feet For a time he
paced the room in silence watched by Billys fearful eyes then he came
back and dropped into the low chair at Billys side His whole manner
had undergone a complete change He was almost shamefaced as he said

Billy I suppose I might as well own up I dont think I did think much
of women until I sawyou

Billy swallowed and wet her lips She tried to speak but before she
could form the words the man went on with his remarks and Billy did not
know whether to be the more relieved or frightened thereat

But you see now its different Thats why I dont like to sail any
longer under false colors Theres been a changea great and wonderful
change that I hardly understand myself

Thats it You dont understand it Im sure interposed Billy
feverishly It may not be such a change after all You may be
deceiving yourself she finished hopefully

The man sighed

I cant wonder you think so of course he almost groaned I was
afraid it would be like that When ones been painted black all ones
life its not easy to change ones color of course

Oh but I didnt say that black wasnt a very nice color stammered
Billy a little wildly

Thank you Cyrils heavy brows rose and fell the fraction of an inch
Still I must confess that just now I should prefer another shade

He paused and Billy cast distractedly about in her mind for a simple
natural change of subject She had just decided to ask him what he
thought of the condition of the Brittany peasants when he questioned
abruptly and in a voice that was not quite steady

Billy what should you say if I should tell you that the avowed
womanhater had strayed so far from the prescribed path as toto like
one woman well enough as to want tomarry her

The word was like a match to the gunpowder of Billys fears Her
selfcontrol was shattered instantly into bits

Marry No no you wouldntyou couldnt really be thinking of that
she babbled growing red and white by turns Only think how a wife
wouldwould bbother you

Bother me When I loved her

But just thinkremember Shed want cushions and rugs and curtains
and you dont like them and shed always be talking and laughing when
you wanted quiet and sheshed want to drag you out to plays and
parties andand everywhere Indeed Cyril Im sure youd never like a
wifelong Billy stopped only because she had no breath with which to
continue

Cyril laughed a little grimly

You dont draw a very attractive picture Billy Still Im not afraid
I dont think this particularwife would do any of those thingsto
trouble me

Oh but you dont know you cant tell argued the girl Besides you
have had so little experience with women that youd just be sure to
make a mistake at first You want to look around very carefullyvery
carefully before you decide

I have looked around and very carefully Billy I know that in all the
world there is just one woman for me

Billy struggled to her feet Mingled pain and terror looked from her
eyes She began to speak wildly incoherently She wondered afterward
just what she would have said if Aunt Hannah had not come into the room
at that moment and announced that Bertram was at the door to take her
for a sleighride if she cared to go

Of course shell go declared Cyril promptly answering for her
It is time I was off anyhow To Billy he said in a low voice You
havent been very encouraging little girlin fact youve been mighty
discouraging But some daysome other day Ill try to make clear to
youmany things

Billy greeted Bertram very cordially It was such a reliefhis cheery
genial companionship The air too was bracing and all the world
lay under a snowwhite blanket of sparkling purity Everything was so
beautiful so restful

It was not surprising perhaps that the very frankness of Billys joy
misled Bertram a little His blood tingled at her nearness and his eyes
grew deep and tender as he looked down at her happy face But of all the
eager words that were so near his lips not one reached the girls ears
until the goodbyes were said then wistfully Bertram hazarded

Billy dont you think sometimes that Im gainingjust a little on
that rival of minethat music

Billys face clouded She shook her head gently

Bertram please dontwhen weve had such a beautiful hour together
she begged It troubles me If you do I cant goagain

But you shall go again cried Bertram bravely smiling straight into
her eyes And there shant ever anything in the world trouble you
eitherthat I can help



CHAPTER XXXIII

WILLIAM IS WORRIED


Billys sleighride had been due to the kindness of a belated winter
storm that had surprised every one the last of March After that March
as if ashamed of her untoward behavior donned her sweetest smiles and
went out like the proverbial lamb With the coming of April and the
stirring of life in the trees Billy too began to be restless and at
the earliest possible moment she made her plans for her long anticipated
digging in the dirt

Just here much to her surprise she met with wonderful assistance from
Bertram He seemed to know just when and where and how to dig and he
displayed suddenly a remarkable knowledge of landscape gardening That
this knowledge was as recent in its acquirement as it was sudden in its
display Billy did not know Very learnedly he talked of perennials and
annuals and without hesitation he made out a list of flowering shrubs
and plants that would give her a succession of bloom throughout
the season His words and phrases smacked loudly of the very newest
florists catalogues but Billy did not notice that She only wondered
at the seemingly exhaustless source of his wisdom

I suspect twould have been better if wed begun things last fall he
told her frowningly one day But theres plenty we can do now anyway
and well put in some quickgrowing things just for this season until
we can get the more permanent things established

And so they worked together studying scheming ordering plants
and seeds their two heads close together above the gaily colored
catalogues Later there was the work itself to be done and though
strong men did the heavier part there was yet plenty left for Billys
eager fingersand for Bertrams And if sometimes in the intimacy of
seedsowing and plantsetting the touch of the slenderer fingers sent
a thrill through the browner ones Bertram made no sign He was careful
always to be the cheerful helpful assistantand that was all

Billy it is true was a little disturbed at being quite so much with
Bertram She dreaded a repetition of some such words as had been uttered
at the end of the sleighride She told herself that she had no right
to grieve Bertram to make it hard for him by being with him but at
the very next breath she could but question did she grieve him Was
it hard for him to have her with him Then she would glance at his eager
face and meet his buoyant smileand answer no After that for a
time at least her fears would be less

Systematically Billy avoided Cyril these days She could not forget his
promise to make many things clear to her some day She thought she knew
what he meantthat he would try to convince her as she had tried to
convince herself that she would make a good wife for him

Billy was very sure that if Cyril could be prevented from speaking his
mind just now his mind would change in time hence her determination to
give his mind that opportunity

Billys avoidance of Cyril was the more easily accomplished because she
was for a time taking a complete rest from her music The new songs
had been finished and sent to the publishers There was no excuse
therefore for Cyrils coming to the house on that score and indeed
he seemed of his own accord to be making only infrequent visits now
Billy was pleased particularly as Marie was not there to play third
party Marie had taken up her teaching again much to Billys distress

But I cant stay here always like this Marie had protested

But I should like to keep you Billy had responded with no less
decision

Marie had been firm however and had gone leaving the little house
lonely without her

Aside from her work in the garden Billy as resolutely avoided Bertram as
she did Cyril It was natural therefore that at this crisis she should
turn to William with a peculiar feeling of restfulness He at least
would be safe she told herself So she frankly welcomed his every
appearance sung to him played to him and took long walks with him
to see some wonderful bracelet or necklace that he had discovered in a
dingy little curioshop

William was delighted He was very fond of his namesake and he had
secretly chafed a little at the way his younger brothers had monopolized
her attention He was rejoiced now that she seemed to be turning to him
for companionship and very eagerly he accepted all the time she could
give him

William had in truth been growing more and more lonely ever since
Billys brief stay beneath his roof years before Those few short weeks
of her merry presence had shown him how very forlorn the house was
without it More and more sorrowfully during past years his thoughts
had gone back to the little white flannel bundle and to the dear hopes
it had carried so long ago If the boy had only lived thought William
mournfully there would not now have been that dreary silence in his
home and that sore ache in his heart

Very soon after William had first seen Billy he began to lay wonderful
plans and in every plan was Billy She was not his child by flesh and
blood he acknowledged but she was his by right of love and needed
care In fancy he looked straight down the years ahead and everywhere
he saw Billy a loving muchloved daughter the joy of his life the
solace of his declining years

To no one had William talked of thisand to no one did he show the
bitterness of his grief when he saw his vision fade into nothingness
through Billys unchanging refusal to live in his home Only he himself
knew the heartache the loneliness the almost unbearable longing of
the past winter months while Billy had lived at Hillside and only he
himself knew now the almost overwhelming joy that was his because of
what he thought he saw in Billys changed attitude toward himself

Great as was Williams joy however his caution was greater He said
nothing to Billy of his new hopes though he did try to pave the way by
dropping an occasional word about the loneliness of the Beacon Street
house since she went away There was something else too that caused
William to be silentwhat he thought he saw between Billy and Bertram
That Bertram was in love with Billy he guessed but that Billy was not
in love with Bertram he very much feared He hesitated almost to speak
or move lest something he should say or do should just at the critical
moment turn matters the wrong way To William this marriage of Bertram
and Billy was an ideal method of solving the problem as of course Billy
would come there to the house to live and he would have his daughter
after all But as the days passed and he could see no progress
on Bertrams part no change in Billy he began to be seriously
worriedand to show it



CHAPTER XXXIV

CLASS DAY


Early in June Billy announced her intention of not going away at all
that summer

I dont need it she declared I have this cool beautiful house
this air this sunshine this adorable view Besides Ive got a scheme
I mean to carry out

There was some consternation among Billys friends when they found out
what this scheme was sundry of Billys humbler acquaintances were to
share the house the air the sunshine and the adorable view with her

But my dear Billy Bertram cried aghast you dont mean to say that
you are going to turn your beautiful little house into a freshair place
for Bostons slum children

Not a bit of it smiled the girl though Id like to really if I
could she added perversely But this is quite another thing Its no
slum work no charity In the first place my guests arent quite so poor
as that and theyre much too proud to be reached by the avowed charity
worker But they need it just the same

But you havent much spare room have you questioned Bertram

No unfortunately so I shall have to take only two or three at a time
and keep them maybe a week or ten days Its just a sugar plum Bertram
Truly it is she added whimsically but with a tender light in her
eyes

But who are these people Bertrams face had lost its look of shocked
surprise and his voice expressed genuine interest

Well to begin with theres Marie Shell stay all summer and help me
entertain my guests at the same time her duties wont be arduous
and shell get a little playtime herself One week Im going to have a
little old maid who keeps a lodging house in the West End For uncounted
years shes been practically tied to a doorbell with never a whole day
to breathe free Ive made arrangements there for a sister to keep house
a whole week and Im going to show this little old maid things she
hasnt seen for years the ocean the green fields and a summer play or
two perhaps

Then theres a little couple that live in a thirdstory flat in South
Boston Theyre young and like good times but the man is on a small
salary and they have had lots of sickness Hes been out so much he
cant take any vacation and they wouldnt have any money to go anywhere
if he could Well Im going to have them a week Shell be here all the
time and hell come out at night of course

Another one is a widow with six children The children are already
provided for by a freshair society but the woman Im going to take
andand give her a whole week of food that she didnt have to cook
herself Another one is a woman who is not so very poor but who has
lost her baby and is blue and discouraged There are some children
too one crippled and a boy who says hes just lonesome And there
arereally Bertram there is no end to them

I can well believe that declared Bertram with emphasis so far as
your generous heart is concerned

Billy colored and looked distressed

But it isnt generosity or charity at all Bertram she protested
You are mistaken when you think it isreally Why I shall enjoy every
bit of it just as well as they doand better perhaps

But you stay herein the cityall summer for their sakes

What if I do Besides this isnt the real city argued Billy with
all these trees and lawns about one And another thing she added
leaning forward confidentially I might as well confess Bertram you
couldnt hire me to leave the place this summernot while all these
things I planted are coming up

Bertram laughed but for some reason he looked wonderfully happy as he
turned away

On the fifteenth of June Kate and her husband arrived from the West A
young brother of Mr Hartwells was to be graduated from Harvard and
Kate said they had come on to represent the family as the elder Mr and
Mrs Hartwell were not strong enough to undertake the journey Kate was
looking well and happy She greeted Billy with effusive cordiality and
openly expressed her admiration of Hillside She looked very keenly into
her brothers face and seemed well pleased with the appearance of Cyril
and Bertram but not so much so with Williams countenance

William does NOT look well she declared one day when she and Billy
were alone together

Sick Uncle William sick Oh I hope not cried the girl

I dont know whether its sick or not returned Mrs Hartwell But
its something Hes troubled Im going to speak to him Hes worried
over something and hes grown terribly thin

But hes always thin reasoned Billy

I know but not like thisever You dont notice it perhaps or
realize it seeing him every day as you do But I know something
troubles him

Oh I hope not murmured Billy with anxious eyes We dont want
Uncle William troubled we all love him too well

Mrs Hartwell did not at once reply but for a long minute she
thoughtfully studied Billys face as it was bent above the sewing in
Billys hand When she did speak she had changed the subject

Young Hartwell was to deliver the Ivy Oration in the Stadium on Class
Day and all the Henshaws were looking eagerly forward to the occasion

You have seen the Stadium of course said Bertram to Billy a few
days before the anticipated Friday

Only from across the river

Is that so And youve never been here Class Day either Good Then
youve got a treat in store Just wait and see

And Billy waitedand she saw Billy began to see in fact before Class
Day Young Hartwell was a popular fellow and he was eager to have his
friends meet Billy and the Henshaws He was a member of the Institute
of 1770 D K E Stylus Signet Round Table and Hasty Pudding Clubs
and nearly every one of these had some sort of function planned for
ClassDay week By the time the day itself arrived Billy was almost as
excited as was young Hartwell himself

It rained ClassDay morning but at nine oclock the sun came out and
drove the clouds away much to every ones delight Billys day began
at noon with the spread given by the Hasty Pudding Club Billy wondered
afterward how many times that day remarks like these were made to her

Youve been here Class Day before of course Youve seen the
confettithrowing No Well you just wait

At ten minutes of four Billy and Mrs Hartwell with Mr Hartwell and
Bertram as escorts entered the cool echoing shadows under the Stadium
and then out in the sunlight they began to climb the broad steps to
their seats

I wanted them high up you see explained Bertram because you can
get the effect so much better There here we are

For the first time Billy turned and looked about her She gave a low cry
of delight

Oh oh how beautifulhow wonderfully beautiful

You just wait crowed Bertram If you think this is beautiful you
just wait

Billy did not seem to hear him Her eyes were sweeping the wonderful
scene before her and her face was aglow with delight

First there was the great amphitheater itself Only the wide curve of
the horseshoe was roped off for todays audience Beyond lay the two
sides with their tier above tier of empty seats almost dazzling in
the sunshine Within the ropedoff curve the scene was of kaleidoscopic
beauty Charmingly gowned young women and carefully groomed young men
were everywhere stirring chatting laughing Gaycolored parasols and
flowergarden hats made here and there brilliant splashes of rainbow
tints Above was an almost cloudless canopy of blue and at the far
horizon earth and sky met and made a picture that was like a wondrous
painted curtain hung from heaven itself

At the first sound of the distant band that told of the graduates
coming Bertram said almost wistfully

Class Day is the only time when I feel out of it You see Im the
first male Henshaw for ages that hasnt been through Harvard and
today you know is the time when the old grads come back and do stunts
like the kidsif they can and some of them can all right They march
in by classes ahead of the seniors and vie with each other in giving
their yells Youll see Cyril and William if your eyes are sharp
enoughand youll see them as you never saw them before

Far down the green field Billy spied now the long black line of moving
figures with a band in the lead Nearer and nearer it came until
greeted by a mighty roar from thousands of throats the leaders swept
into the great bowl of the horseshoe curve

And how they yelled and cheeredthose men whose first Class Day lay
five ten fifteen even twenty or more years behind them as told by
the banners which they so proudly carried How they got their heads
together and gave the Rah Rah Rah with unswerving eyes on their
leader How they beat the air with their hats in time to their lusty
shouts And how the throngs above cheered and clapped in answer until
they almost split their throatsand did split their glovesespecially
when the blackgowned seniors swept into view

And when the curving line of black had become one solid mass of
humanity that filled the bowl from side to side the vast throng seated
themselves and a great hush fell while the Glee Club sang

Young Hartwell proved to be a good speaker and his ringing voice
reached even the topmost tier of seats Billy was charmed and
interested Everything she saw and heard was but a new source of
enjoyment and she had quite forgotten the thing for which she was to
wait when she saw the ushers passing through the aisles with their
baskets of manyhued packages of confetti and countless rolls of paper
ribbon

It began then the merry war between the students below and the throng
above In a trice the air was filled with shimmering bits of red blue
white green purple pink and yellow From all directions fluttering
streamers that showed every color of the rainbow were flung to the
breeze until upheld by the supporting wires they made a fairy lace
work of marvelous beauty

Oh oh oh cried Billy her eyes misty with emotion I think I never
saw anything in my life so lovely

I thought youd like it gloried Bertram You know I said to wait

But even with this Class Day for Billy was not finished There was
still Hartwells own spread from six to eight and after that there were
the Presidents reception and dancing in the Memorial Hall and in the
Gymnasium There was the Fairyland of the yard too softly aglow
with moving throngs of beautiful women and gallant men But what Billy
remembered best of all was the exquisite harmony that came to her
through the hushed night air when the Glee Club sang Fair Harvard on the
steps of Holworthy Hall



CHAPTER XXXV

SISTER KATE AGAIN


It was on the Sunday following Class Day that Mrs Hartwell carried out
her determination to speak to William The West had not taken from
Kate her love of managing and she thought she saw now a matter that
sorely needed her guiding hand

Williams thin face anxious looks and nervous manner had troubled
her ever since she came Then one day very suddenly had come
enlightenment William was in loveand with Billy

Mrs Hartwell watched William very closely after that She saw his eyes
follow Billy fondly yet anxiously She saw his open joy at being with
her and at any little attention word or look that the girl gave him
She remembered too something that Bertram had said about Williams
grief because Billy would not live at the Strata She thought she saw
something else also that Billy was fond of William but that William
did not know it hence his frequent troubled scrutiny of her face
Why these two should play at cross purposes Sister Kate could not
understand She smiled however confidently they should not play at
cross purposes much longer she declared

On Sunday afternoon Kate asked her eldest brother to take her driving

Not a motor car I want a horsethat will let me talk she said

Certainly agreed William with a smile but Bertram who chanced to
hear her put in the sly comment As if ANY horse could preventthat

On the drive Kate began to talk at once but she did not plunge into
the subject nearest her heart until she had adroitly led William into a
glowing enumeration of Billys many charming characteristics then she
said

William why dont you take Billy home with you

William stirred uneasily as he always did when anything annoyed him

My dear Kate there is nothing I should like better to do he replied

Then why dont you do it

Ihope to sometime

But why not now

Im afraid Billy is not quiteready

Nonsense A young girl like that does not know her own mind lots
of times Just press the matter a little Love will work
wonderssometimes

William blushed like a girl To him her words had but one
meaningBertrams love for Billy William had never spoken of this
suspected love affair to any one He had even thought that he was the
only one that had discovered it To hear his sister refer thus lightly
to it came therefore in the nature of a shock to him

Then you haveseen ittoo he stammered

Seen it too laughed Kate with her confident eyes on Williams
flushed face I should say I had seen it Any one could see it

William blushed again Love to him had always been something sacred
something that called for hushed voices and twilight This merry
discussion in the sunlight of even anothers love was disconcerting

Now come William resumed Kate after a moment speak to Billy and
have the matter settled once for all Its worrying you I can see it
is

Again William stirred uneasily

But Kate I cant do anything I told you before I dont believe
Billy isready

Nonsense Ask her

But Kate a girl wont marry against her will

I dont believe it is against her will

Kate Honestly

Honestly Ive watched her

Then I WILL speak cried the man his face alight ifif you think
anything I can say wouldhelp There is nothingnothing in all this
world that I so desire Kate as to have that little girl back home And
of course that would do it Shed live there you know

Why ofcourse murmured Kate with a puzzled frown There was
something in this last remark of Williams that she did not quite
understand Surely he could not suppose that she had any idea that after
he had married Billy they would go to live anywhere elseshe thought
For a moment she considered the matter vaguely then she turned her
attention to something else She was the more ready to do this because
she believed that she had said enough for the present it was well to
sow seeds but it was also well to let them have a chance to grow she
told herself

Mrs Hartwells next move was to speak to Billy and she was careful to
do this at once so that she might pave the way for William

She began her conversation with an ingratiating smile and the words

Well Billy Ive been doing a little detective work on my own
account

Detective work

Yes about William You know I told you the other day how troubled and
anxious he looked to me Well Ive found out whats the matter

What is it

Yourself

Myself Why Mrs Hartwell what can you mean

The elder lady smiled significantly

Oh its merely another case my dear of faint heart never won fair
lady Ive been helping on the faint heart thats all

But I dont understand

No I cant believe you quite mean that my dear Surely you must know
how earnestly my brother William is longing for you to go back and live
with him

Like William Billy flushed scarlet

Mrs Hartwell certainly no one could know better than YOURSELF why
that is quite impossible she frowned

The other colored confusedly

I understand of course what you mean And Billy Ill confess that
Ive been sorry lots of times since that I spoke as I did to you
particularly when I saw how it grieved my brother William to have you go
away If I blundered then Im sorry and perhaps I did blunder At all
events that is only the more reason now why I am so anxious to do what
I can to rectify that old mistake and plead Williams suit

To Mrs Hartwells blank amazement Billy laughed outright

Williams suit she quoted merrily Why Mrs Hartwell there isnt
any suit to it Uncle William doesnt want me to marry him

Indeed he does

Billy stopped laughing and sat suddenly erect

MRS HARTWELL

Billy is it possible that you did not know this

Indeed I dont know it andexcuse me but I dont think you do
either

But I do Ive talked with him and hes very much in earnest urged
Mrs Hartwell speaking very rapidly He says theres nothing in all
the world that he so desires And Billy you do care for himI know
you do

Why of course I care for himbut notthat way

But Billy think Mrs Hartwell was very earnest now and a little
frightened She felt that she must bring Billy to terms in some way
now that William had been encouraged to put his fate to the test Just
remember how good William has always been to you and think what you
have been and may BEif you only willin his lonely life Think of
his great sorrow years ago Think of this dreary waste of years between
Think how now his heart has turned to you for love and comfort and rest
Billy you cant turn awayyou cant find it in your heart to turn
away from that dear good man who loves you so Mrs Hartwells voice
shook effectively and even her eyes looked through tears Mentally
she was congratulating herself she had not supposed she could make so
touching an appeal

In the chair opposite the girl sat very still She was pale and her
eyes showed a frightened questioning in their depths For a long minute
she said nothing then she rose dazedly to her feet

Mrs Hartwell please do not speak of this to any one she begged in
a low voice II am taken quite by surprise I shall have to think it
outalone

Billy did not sleep well that night Always before her eyes was the
vision of Williams face and always in her ears was the echo of Mrs
Hartwells words Remember how good William has always been to you
Think of his great sorrow years ago Think of this dreary waste of years
between Think how now his heart has turned to you for love and comfort
and rest

For a time Billy tossed about on her bed trying to close her eyes to
the vision and her ears to the echo Then finding that neither was
possible she set herself earnestly to thinking the matter out

William loved her Extraordinary as it seemed such was the fact Mrs
Hartwell said so And nowwhat must she do what could she do She
loved no oneof that she was very sure She was even beginning to
think that she would never love any one There were Calderwell Cyril
Bertram to say nothing of sundry others who had loved her apparently
but whom she could not love Such being the case if she were indeed
incapable of love herself why should she not make the sacrifice of
giving up her career her independence and in that way bring this great
joy to Uncle Williams heart Even as she said the Uncle William
to herself Billy bit her lip and realized that she must no longer say
Uncle Williamif she married him

If she married him The words startled her If she married him
Well what of it She would go to live at the Strata of course and
there would be Cyril and Bertram It might be awkward and yetshe did
not believe Cyril was in love with anything but his music and as to
Bertramit was the same with Bertram and his painting and he would
soon forget that he had ever fancied he loved her After that he would
be simply a congenial friend and companiona good comrade As Billy
thought of it indeed one of the pleasantest features of this marriage
with William would be the delightful comradeship of her brother
Bertram

Billy dwelt then at some length on Williams love for her his longing
for her presence and his dreary years of loneliness And he was so
good to her she recollected he had always been good to her He was
older to be suremuch older than she but after all it would not be
so difficult so very difficult to learn to love him At all events
whatever happened she would have the supreme satisfaction of knowing
that at least she had brought into dear Unclethat is into Williams
life the great peace and joy that only she could give

It was almost dawn when Billy arrived at this not uncheerful state of
prospective martyrdom She turned over then with a sigh and settled
herself to sleep She was relieved that she had decided the question
She was glad that she knew just what to say when William should speak
He was a dear dear man and she would not make it hard for him she
promised herself She would be Williams wife



CHAPTER XXXVI

WILLIAM MEETS WITH A SURPRISE


In spite of his sisters confident assurance that the time was ripe for
him to speak to Billy William delayed some days before broaching the
matter to her His courage was not so good as it had been when he was
talking with Kate It seemed now as it always had a fearsome thing to
try to hasten on this love affair between Billy and Bertram He could
not see in spite of Kates words that Billy showed unmistakable
evidence at all of being in love with his brother The more he thought
of it in fact the more he dreaded the carrying out of his promise to
speak to his namesake

What should he say he asked himself How could he word it He could not
very well accost her with Oh Billy I wish youd please hurry up and
marry Bertram because then youd come and live with me Neither could
he plead Bertrams cause directly Quite probably Bertram would prefer
to plead his own Then too if Billy really was not in love with
Bertramwhat then Might not his own untimely haste in the matter
forever put an end to the chance of her caring for him

It was indeed a delicate matter and as William pondered it he wished
himself well out of it and that Kate had not spoken But even as
he formed the wish William remembered with a thrill Kates positive
assertion that a word from him would do wonders and that now was the
time to utter it He decided then that he would speak that he must
speak but that at the same time he would proceed with a caution that
would permit a hasty retreat if he saw that his words were not having
the desired effect He would begin with a frank confession of his
grief at her leaving him and of his longing for her return then very
gradually if wisdom counseled it he would go on to speak of Bertrams
love for her and of his own hope that she would make Bertram and all
the Strata glad by loving him in return

Mrs Hartwell had returned to her Western home before William found just
the opportunity for his talk with Billy True to his belief that only
hushed voices and twilight were fitting for such a subject he waited
until he found the girl early one evening alone on her vineshaded
veranda He noticed that as he seated himself at her side she flushed a
little and half started to rise with a nervous fluttering of her hands
and a murmured Ill call Aunt Hannah It was then that with sudden
courage he resolved to speak

Billy dont go he said gently with a touch of his hand on her arm
There is something I want to say to you II have wanted to say it for
some time

Why ofof course stammered the girl falling back in her seat And
again William noticed that odd fluttering of the slim little hands

For a time no one spoke then William began softly his eyes on the
distant skyline still faintly aglow with the sunsets reflection

Billy I want to tell you a story Long years ago there was a man who
had a happy home with a young wife and a tiny baby boy in it I could
not begin to tell you all the plans that man made for that baby boy
Such a great and good and wonderful being that tiny baby was one day to
become But the babywent away after a time and carried with him all
the plansand he never came back Behind him he left empty hearts that
ached and great bare rooms that seemed always to be echoing sighs and
sobs And then one day such a few years after the young wife went to
find her baby and left the man all alone with the heart that ached and
the great bare rooms that echoed sighs and sobs

Perhaps it was thisthe bareness of the roomsthat made the man turn
to his boyish passion for collecting things He wanted to fill those
rooms full fullso that the sighs and sobs could not be heard and he
wanted to fill his heart too with something that would still the ache
And he tried Already he had his boyish treasures and these he lined up
in brave array but his rooms still echoed and his heart still ached
so he built more shelves and bought more cabinets and set himself to
filling them hoping at the same time that he might fill all that dreary
waste of hours outside of businesshours which once had been all too
short to devote to the young wife and the baby boy

One by one the years passed and one by one the shelves and the
cabinets were filled The man fancied sometimes that he had succeeded
but in his heart of hearts he knew that the ache was merely dulled and
that darkness had only to come to set the rooms once more to echoing
the sighs and sobs And thenbut perhaps you are tired of the story
Billy William turned with questioning eyes

No oh no faltered Billy It is beautiful but sosad

But the saddest part is doneI hope said William softly Let me
tell you A wonderful thing happened then Suddenly right out of a dull
gray sky of hopelessness dropped a little browneyed girl and a little
gray cat All over the house they frolicked filling every nook and
cranny with laughter and light and happiness And then like magic the
man lost the ache in his heart and the rooms lost their echoing sighs
and sobs The man knew then that never again could he hope to fill his
heart and life with senseless things of clay and metal He knew that the
one thing he wanted always near him was the little browneyed girl and
he hoped that he could keep her But just as he was beginning to bask
in this new lightit went out As suddenly as they had come the little
browneyed girl and the gray cat went away Why the man did not know
He knew only that the ache had come back doubly intense and that the
rooms were more gloomy than ever And now BillyWilliams voice
shook a littleit is for you to finish the story It is for you to say
whether that mans heart shall ache on and on down to a lonely old age
and whether those rooms shall always echo the sighs and sobs of the
past

And I will finish it choked Billy holding out both her hands It
shant achethey shant echo

The man leaned forward eagerly unbelievingly and caught the hands in
his own

Billy do you mean it Then you willcome

Yes yes I didnt knowI didnt think I never supposed it was like
that Of course Ill come And in a moment she was sobbing in his arms

Billy breathed William rapturously as he touched his lips to her
forehead My own little Billy

It was a few minutes later when Billy was more calm that William
started to speak of Bertram For a moment he had been tempted not to
mention his brother now that his own point had been won so surprisingly
quick but the new softness in Billys face had encouraged him and he
did not like to let the occasion pass when a word from him might do so
much for Bertram His lips parted but no words cameBilly herself had
begun to speak

Im sure I dont know why Im crying she stammered dabbing her eyes
with her round moist ball of a handerchief I hope when Im your wife
Ill learn to be more selfcontrolled But you know I am young and
youll have to be patient

As once before at something Billy said the world to William went
suddenly mad His head swam dizzily and his throat tightened so that
he could scarcely breathe By sheer force of will he kept his arm about
Billys shoulder and he prayed that she might not know how numb and
cold it had grown Even then he thought he could not have heard aright

Eryou said he questioned faintly

I say when Im your wife I hope Ill learn to be more selfcontrolled
laughed Billy nervously You see I just thought I ought to remind you
that I am young and that youll have to be patient

William stammered somethinga hurried something he wondered afterward
what it was That it must have been satisfactory to Billy was evident
for she began laughingly to talk again What she said William scarcely
knew though he was conscious of making an occasional vague reply He
was still floundering in a hopeless sea of confusion and dismay His own
desire was to get up and say good night at once He wanted to be alone
to think He realized however with sickening force that men do not
propose and run awayif they are accepted And he was accepted he
realized that too overwhelmingly Then he tried to think how it had
happened what he had said how she could so have misunderstood his
meaning This line of thought he abandoned quickly however it could do
no good But what could do good he asked himself What could he do

With blinding force came the answer he could do nothing Billy cared
for him Billy had said yes Billy expected to be his wife As if he
could say to her now I beg your pardon but twas all a mistake _I_
did not ask you to marry me

Very valiantly then William summoned his wits and tried to act his part
He told himself too that it would not be a hard one that he loved
Billy dearly and that he would try to make her happy He winced a
little at this thought for he remembered suddenly how old he wasas if
he at his age were a fit match for a girl of twentyone

And then he looked at Billy The girl was plainly nervous There was a
deep flush on her cheeks and a brilliant sparkle in her eyes She
was talking rapidlyalmost incoherently at timesand her voice was
tremulous Frequent little embarrassed laughs punctuated her sentences
and her fingers toyed with everything that came within reach Some time
before she had sprung to her feet and had turned on the electric lights
and when she came back she had not taken her old position at Williams
side but had seated herself in a chair near by All of which according
to Williams eyes meant the maidenly shyness of a girl who has just
said yes to the man she loves

William went home that night in a daze To himself he said that he had
gone out in search of a daughter and had come back with a wife



CHAPTER XXXVII

WILLIAMS BROTHER


It was decided that for the present the engagement should not be
known outside the family The wedding would not take place immediately
William said and it was just as well to keep the matter to themselves
until plans were a little more definite

The members of the family were told at once Aunt Hannah said Oh my
grief and conscience three times and made matters scarcely better by
adding apologetically Oh of course its all right its all right
only She did not finish her sentence and William who had told her
the news did not know whether he would have been more or less pleased
if she had finished it

Cyril received the information moodily and lapsed at once into a fit
of abstraction from which he roused himself hardly enough to offer
perfunctory congratulations and best wishes

Billy was a little puzzled at Cyrils behavior She had been sure for
some time that Cyril had ceased to care specially for her even if
he ever did fancy that he loved her She had hoped to keep him for
a friend but of late she had been forced to question even his
friendliness He had in fact gone back almost to his old reserve and
taciturn aloofness

From the West in response to Williams news of the engagement came a
cordially pleased note in Kates scrawling handwriting Kate indeed
seemed to be the only member of the family who was genuinely delighted
with the coming marriage As to BertramBertram appeared to have aged
years in a single night so drawn and white was his face the morning
after William had told him his plans

William had dreaded most of all to tell Bertram He was very sure that
Bertram himself cared for Billy and it was doubly hard because in
Williams own mind was a strong conviction that the younger man was
decidedly the one for her Realizing however that Bertram must be
told William chose a time for the telling when Bertram was smoking in
his den in the twilight with his face half hidden from sight

Bertram said littlevery little that night but in the morning he went
straight to Billy

Billy was shocked She had never seen the smiling selfreliant
debonair Bertram like this

Billy is this true he demanded The dull misery in his voice told
Billy that he knew the answer before he asked the question

Yes yes but Bertram pleaseplease dont take it like this she
implored

How would you have me take it

Why justjust sensibly You know I told you thatthat the other
never could benever

I know YOU said so but Ibelieved otherwise

But I told youI did not love youthat way

Bertram winced He rose to his feet abruptly

I know you did Billy Im a fool of course to think that I could
everchange it I shouldnt have come here either this morning But
Ihad to Goodby His face as he held out his hand was tragic with
renunciation

Why Bertram you arent goingnowlike this cried the girl
Youve just come

The man turned almost impatiently

And do you think I can staylike this Billy wont you say goodby
he asked in a softer voice again with outstretched hand

Billy shook her head She ignored the hand and resolutely backed away

No not like that You are angry with me she grieved Besides you
make it sound as ifif you were going away

I am going away

Bertram There was terror as well as dismay in Billys voice

Again the man turned sharply

Billy why are you making this thing so hard for me he asked in
despair Cant you see that I must go

Indeed I cant And you mustnt go either There isnt any reason
why you should urged Billy talking very fast and working her fingers
nervously Things are just the same as they were beforefor you Im
just going to marry William but I wasnt ever going to marry you so
that doesnt change things any for you Dont you see Why Bertram you
mustnt go away There wont be anybody left Cyrils going next week
you know and if you go there wont be anybody left but William and
me Bertram you mustnt go dont you see I should feel lost
withoutyou Billy was almost crying now

Bertram looked up quickly An odd change had come to his face For a
moment he gazed silently into Billys agitated countenance then he
asked in a low voice

Billy did you think that after you and William were married I should
still continue to live atthe Strata

Why of course you will cried the girl indignantly Why Bertram
youll be my brother thenmy real brother and one of the very chiefest
things Im anticipating when I go there to live is the good times you
and I will have together when Im Williams wife

Bertram drew in his breath audibly and caught his lower lip between
his teeth With an abrupt movement he turned his back and walked to
the window For a full minute he stayed there watched by the amazed
displeased eyes of the girl When he came back he sat down quietly in
the chair facing Billy His countenance was grave and his eyes were a
little troubled but the haggard look of misery was quite gone

Billy he began gently you must forgive my saying this butare you
quite sure youlove William

Billy flushed with anger

You have no right to ask such a question Of course I love William

Of course you dowe all love William William is in fact a most
lovable man But Williams wife should perhaps love him a little
differently fromall of us

And she will certainly retorted the girl with a quick lifting of
her chin Bertram I dont think you have any right toto make such
insinuations

And I wont make them any more replied Bertram gravely I just
wanted you to make sure that youknew

I shall make sure and I shall know said Billy firmlyso firmly
that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well
as others

There was a long pause then the man asked diffidently

And so you are very sure thatthat you want me tostay

Indeed I do Besidesdont you rememberthere are all my people to
be entertained They must be taken to places and given motor rides
and picnics You told me last week that youd love to help me but of
course if you dont want to

But I do want to cried Bertram heartily a gleam of the old
cheerfulness springing to his eyes Im dying to

The girl looked up with quick distrust For a moment she eyed him
with bent brows To her mind he had gone back to his old airy hopeful
lightheartedness He was once more only Bertram She hesitated then
said with stern decision

Bertram you know I want you and you must know that Im delighted to
have you drop this silly notion of going away But if this quick change
means that you are staying with any idea thatthat _I_ shall change
thenthen you must go But if you will stay as WILLIAMS BROTHER
thenIll be more than glad to have you

Ill stayas Williams brother agreed Bertram and Billy did not
notice the quick indrawing of his breath nor the close shutting of his
lips after the words were spoken



CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE ENGAGEMENT OF TWO


By the middle of July the routine of Billys days was well established
Marie had been for a week a welcome addition to the family and she
was proving to be of invaluable aid in entertaining Billys guests The
overworked widow and the little lodginghouse keeper from the West End
were enjoying Billys hospitality now and just to look at their beaming
countenances was an inspiration Billy said

Cyril had gone abroad Aunt Hannah was spending a week at the North
Shore with friends Bertram true to his promise was playing the
gallant to Billys guests and so assiduous was he in his attentions
that Billy at last remonstrated with him

But I didnt mean them to take ALL your time she protested

Dont they like it Do they see too much of me he demanded

No no They love it of course You must know that Nobody else could
give such beautiful times as youve given us But its yourself Im
thinking of Youre giving up all your time Besides I didnt mean to
keep you here all summer of course You always go away some you know
for a vacation

But Im having a vacation here doing this laughed Bertram Im sure
Im getting sea air down to the beaches and mountain air out to the
Blue Hills And as for excitementif you can find anything more wildly
exciting than it was yesterday when Miss Marie and I took the widow
and the spinster lady on the Rollercoasterjust show it to me thats
all

Billy laughed

They told me about itMarie in particular She said you were lovely to
them and let them do every single thing they wanted to and that half
an hour after they got there they were like two children let out of
school Dear me I wish Id gone I never stay at home that I dont miss
something she finished regretfully

Bertram shrugged his shoulders

If its Rollercoasters and Chutethechutes that you want I fancy
youll get enough before the week is out he sighed laughingly They
said theyd like to go there tomorrow please when I asked them what
we should do next What surprises me is that they like such thingssuch
hairraising things When I first saw them blackgowned and
stiffbacked sitting in your little room here I thought I should never
dare offer them anything more wildly exciting than a church service or
a lecture on psychology with perhaps a band concert hinted at provided
the band could be properly instructed beforehand as to tempo and
selections But nowreally Billy why do you suppose they have taken
such a fancy to these kiddish stuntsthose two staid women

Billy laughed but her eyes softened

I dont know unless its because all their lives theyve been tied
to such dead monotony that just the exhilaration of motion is bliss to
them But you wont always have to risk your neck and your temper in
this fashion Bertram Next week my little couple from South Boston
comes She adores pictures and stuffed animals Youll have to do the
museums with her Then theres little crippled Tommyhell be perfectly
contented if youll put him down where he can hear the band play And
all youll have to do when that one stops is to pilot him to the next
one This IS good of you Bertram and I do thank you for it finished
Billy fervently just as Marie the widow and the spinster lady
entered the room

Billy told herself these days that she was very happyvery happy
indeed Was she not engaged to a good man and did she not also have it
in her power to make the long summer days a pleasure to many people
The fact that she had to tell herself that she was happy in order to
convince herself that she was so did not occur to Billyyet

Not long after Marie arrived Billy told her of the engagement William
was at the house very frequently and owing to the intimacy of Maries
relationship with the family Billy decided to tell her how matters
stood Maries reception of the news was somewhat surprising First she
looked frightened

To Williamyou are engaged to William

Whyyes

But I thoughtsurely it wasdont you meanMr Cyril

No I dont laughed Billy And certainly I ought to know

And you dontcare for him

I hope notif Im going to marry William

So light was Billys voice and manner that Marie dared one more
question

And hedoesnt carefor you

I hope notif William is going to marry me laughed Billy again

Ohh breathed Marie with an odd intonation of relief Then Im
gladso glad And I hope youll be very very happy dear

Billy looked into Maries glowing face and was pleased there seemed to
be so few so very few faces into which she had looked and found entire
approbation of her engagement to William

Billy saw a great deal of William now He was always kind and
considerate and he tried to help her entertain her guests but Billy
grateful as she was to him for his efforts was relieved when he
resigned his place to Bertram Bertram did indeed know so much better
how to do it William tried to help her too about training her vines
and rosebushes but of course even in this he could not be expected to
show quite the interest that Bertram manifested in every green shoot and
opening bud for he had not helped her plant them as Bertram had

Billy was a little troubled sometimes that she did not feel more at
ease with William She thought it natural that she should feel a little
diffident with him in the face of his sudden change from an uncle
to an accepted lover but she did not see why she should be afraid of
himyet she was She owned that to herself unhappily And he was so
goodshe owned that too He seemed not to have a thought in the world
but for her comfort and happiness and there was no end to the tactful
little things he was always doing for her pleasure He seemed also to
have divined that she did not like to be kissed and caressed and only
occasionally did he kiss her and then it was merely a sort of fatherly
salute on her foreheadfor which consideration Billy was grateful
Billy decided that she would not like to be kissed on the lips

After some days of puzzling over the matter Billy concluded that it was
selfconsciousness that caused all the trouble With William she was
selfconscious If she could only forget that she was some day to be
Williams wife the old delightful comradeship would return and
she would be at ease again with him In time after she had become
accustomed to the idea of marriage it would not so confuse her of
course She loved him dearly and she wanted to make him happy but for
the presentjust while she was getting used to thingsshe would try
to forget sometimes that she was going to be Williams wife

Billy was happier now She was always happier after she had thought
things out to her own satisfaction She turned with new zest to
the entertainment of her guests and with Bertram she planned many
delightful trips for their pleasure Bertram was a great comfort to her
these days Never in word or look could she see that he overstepped
the role which he had promised to playWilliams brother

Billy went back to her music too A new melody was running through her
head and she longed to put it on paper Already her first little Group
of Songs had found friends and Billy to a very modest extent was
beginning to taste the sweets of fame

Thus by all these interests did Billy try to get used to things



CHAPTER XXXIX

A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER


Of all Billys guests Marie was very plainly the happiest She was a
permanent guest it is true while the others came for only a week or
two at a time but it was not this Billy decided that had brought so
brilliant a sparkle to Maries eyes so joyous a laugh to her lips The
joyousness was all the more noticeable because heretofore Marie while
very sweet had been also sad Her big blue eyes had always carried a
haunting shadow and her step had lacked the spring belonging to youth
and happiness Certainly Billy had never seen her like this before

Verily Marie she teased one day have you found an exhaustless
supply of stockings to mend or a neverdone pudding to makewhich

Why What do you mean

Oh nothing I was only wondering just what had brought that new light
to your eyes

Is there a new light

There certainly is

It must be because Im so happy then sighed Marie because youre
so good to me

Is that all

Isnt that enough Maries tone was evasive

No Billy shook her head mischievously Marie what is it

Its nothingreally its nothing protested Marie hurrying out of
the room with a nervous laugh

Billy frowned She was suspicious before she was sure now In less than
twelve hours time came her opportunity She was alone again with Marie

Marie who is he she asked abruptly

He Who

The man who is to wear the stockings and eat the pudding

The little music teacher flushed very red but she managed to display
something that might pass for surprise

BILLY

Come dear coaxed Billy winningly Tell me about it Im so
interested

But there isnt anything to tellreally there isnt

Who is he

He isnt anybodythat is he doesnt know hes anybody amended
Marie

Billy laughed softly

Oh doesnt he Hasnt he ever shownthat he cared

No that isperhaps he has only I thought thenthat it wasanother
girl

Another girl So theres another girl in the case

Yes I mean no corrected Marie suddenly beginning to realize what
she was saying Really it wasnt anythingit isnt anything she
protested

Hmm murmured Billy archly Oh Im getting on some He did show
once that he cared but you thought it was another girl and you
coldly looked the other way Now there ISNT any other girl you find
andMarie tell me the rest

Marie shook her head emphatically and pulled herself gently away from
Billys grasp

No no please she begged It really isnt anything Im sure Im
imagining it all she cried as she ran away

During the days that followed Billy speculated not a little on Maries
halftold story and wondered interestedly who the man might be She
questioned Marie once again but the girl would tell nothing more and
indeed Billy was so occupied with her own perplexities that she had
little time for those of other people

To herself Billy was forced to own that she was not getting used to
things She was still selfconscious with William she could not forget
that she was one day to be his wife She could not bring back the dear
old freedom of comradeship with him

Billy was alarmed now She had begun to ask herself searching questions
What should she do if never never should she get used to the idea
of marrying William How could she marry him if he was still Uncle
William and never her dear lover in her eyes Why had she not been
wise enough and brave enough to tell him in the first place that she
was not at all sure that she loved him but that she would try to do so
Then when she had triedas she had nowand failed she could have told
him honestly the truth and it would not have been so great a shock to
him as it must be now if she should tell him

Billy had remorsefully come to the conclusion that she could never love
any man well enough to marry him when one day so small a thing as a
piece of paper fluttered into her vision and showed her the fallacy of
that idea

It was a halfsheet of note paper and it blew from Maries balcony to
the lawn below Billy found it there later and as she picked it up her
eyes fell on a single name in Maries handwriting inscribed half a dozen
times as if the writer had musingly accompanied her thoughts with her
pen and the name was Marie Henshaw

For a moment Billy stared at the name perplexedlythen in a flash came
the remembrance of Maries words and Billy breathed Henshawthe
manBERTRAM

Billy dropped the paper then and fled In her own room behind locked
doors she sat down to think

Bertram It was he for whom Marie caredHER Bertram And then it came
to Billy with staggering force that he was not HER Bertram at all He
never could be her Bertram now He wasMaries

Billy was frightened then so fierce was this strange new something that
rose within herthis overpowering something that seemed to blot out all
the world and leave onlyBertram She knew then that it had always
been Bertram to whom she had turned though she had been blind to the
cause of that turning Always her plans had included him Always she had
been the happiest in his presence never had she pictured him anywhere
else but at her side Certainly never had she pictured him as the
devoted lover of another woman And she had not known what it all
meantpoor blind child that she was

Very resolutely now Billy set herself to looking matters squarely in
the face She understood it quite well All summer Marie and Bertram had
been thrown together No wonder Marie had fallen in love with Bertram
and that heBilly thought she comprehended now why Bertram had found it
so easy for the last few weeks to be Williams brother She of course
had been the other girl whom Marie had once feared that the man loved
It was all so clearso woefully clear

With an aching heart Billy asked herself what now was to be done
For herself turn whichever way she could she could see nothing but
unhappiness She determined therefore with Spartan fortitude that
to no one else would she bring equal unhappiness She would be silent
Bertram and Marie loved each other That matter was settled As to
WilliamBilly thought of the story William had told her of his lonely
lifeof the plea he had made to her and her heart ached Whatever
happened William must be made happy William must not be told Her
promise to William must be kept



CHAPTER XL

WILLIAM PAYS A VISIT


Before September passed all Billys friends said that her summers
selfappointed task had been too hard for her In no other way could
they account for the sad change that had come to her

Undeniably Billy looked really ill Always slender she was shadowlike
now Her eyes had found again the wistful appeal of her girlhood only
now they carried something that was almost fear as well The roseflush
had gone from her cheeks and pathetic little hollows had appeared
making the round young chin below look almost pointed Certainly Billy
did seem to be ill

Late in September William went West on business Incidentally he called
to see his sister Kate

Well and how is everybody asked Kate cheerily after the greetings
were over

William sighed

Well everybody to me Kate is pretty badly off Were worried
about Billy

Billy You dont mean shes sick Why shes always been the picture of
health

I know she has but she isnt now

Whats the trouble

Thats what we dont know

Youve had the doctor

Of course two or three of themthough much against Billys will
Butthey didnt help us

What did they say

They could find nothing except perhaps a little temporary stomach
trouble or something of that kind which they all agreed was no just
cause for her present condition

But what did they say it was

Why they said it seemed like nervousness or as if something was
troubling her They asked if she werent under some sort of strain

Well is she Does anything trouble her

Not that I know of Anyhow if there is anything none of us can find
out what it is

Kate frowned She threw a quick look into her brothers face

William she began hesitatingly forgive me butBilly is quite
happy inher engagement I suppose

The man flushed painfully and sighed

Ive thought of that of course In fact it was the first thing I
did think of I even began to watch her rather closely and once
Iquestioned her a little

What did she say

She seemed so frightened and distressed that I didnt say much myself
I couldnt I had but just begun when her eyes filled with tears and
she asked me in a frightened little voice if she had done anything to
displease me anything to make me unhappy and she seemed so anxious
and grieved and dismayed that I should even question her that I had to
stop

What has she done this summer Where has she been

She hasnt been anywhere Didnt I write you Shes kept open house for
a lot of her less fortunate friendsa sort of vacation home you know
andand I must say shes given them a world of happiness too

But wasnt that hard for her

It didnt seem to be She appeared to enjoy it immensely particularly
at first Of course she had plenty of help and that wonderful little
Miss Hawthorn has been a host in herself Theyre all gone now anyway
except Miss Hawthorn

But Billy must have had the care and the excitement

Perhapsto a certain extent Though not much after all You see
Bertram too has given up his summer to them and has been playing the
devoted escort to the whole bunch Indeed for the last few weeks of it
since Billy began to seem so ill he and Miss Hawthorn have schemed
to take all the care from Billy and they have done the whole thing
together

But what HAS Billy done to make her like this

I dont know Shes done lots for me in all sorts of wayscataloguing
my curios you know and going with me to hunt up things In fact she
seems the happiest when she IS doing something for me Its come to be
a sort of mania with her Im afraidto do something for me Kate Im
really worried What do you suppose is the matter

Kate shook her head The puzzled frown had come back to her face

I cant imagine she began slowly Of course when I told her you
loved her and

When you told her whaat exploded the usually lowvoiced William
with sudden sharpness

When I told her that you loved her William You see I

William sprang to his feet

Told her that I loved her he cried aghast Good heavens Kate do
you mean to say that YOU told her THAT

Why yyes

And may I ask where you got your information

Why William Henshaw what a question I got it from yourself of
course defended Kate

From ME Williams face expressed sheer amazement

Certainly on that drive when I was East in June returned Kate with
dignity YOU evidently have forgotten it but I have not You told me
very frankly how much you thought of her and how you longed to have her
back there with you but that she didnt seem to be ready to come I was
sorry for you and I wanted to do something to help particularly as
it might have been my fault partly that she went away in the first
place

William lifted his head

What do you mean

Why nothing only that II told her a little of howhow upsetting
her arrival had been to everything and of how much you had done for
her and put yourself out I said it so shed appreciate things of
course but she took it quite differently from what I had intended she
should take it and seemed quite cut up about it Then she went away in
that wily impulsive fashion

William bit his lip but he did not speak Kate was plunging on
feverishly and in the face of the greater revelation he let the lesser
one drop

And so thats why I was particularly anxious to bring things around
right again continued Kate And thats why I spoke I thought Id
seen how things were and on the drive I said so Then is when I advised
you to speak to Billy but you declared that Billy wasnt ready and
that you couldnt make a girl marry against her will NOW dont you
recollect it

A great light of understanding broke over Williams face He started
to speak but something evidently stayed the words on his lips With
controlled deliberation he turned and sat down Then he said

Kate will you kindly tell me just what you DID do

Why I didnt do so very much I just tried to help thats all After
I talked with you and advised you to ask Billy right away to marry you
I went to her I thought she cared for you already anyway but I just
wanted to tell her how very much it was to you and so sort of pave the
way And now comes the part that I started to tell you a little while
ago when you caught me up so sharply I was going to say that when I
told Billy this she appeared to be surprised and almost frightened
You see she hadnt known you cared for her after all and so I had a
chance to help and make it plain to her how you did love her so that
when you spoke everything would be all right There thats all You see
I didnt do so very much

So very much groaned William starting to his feet Great Scott

Why William what do you mean Where are you going

Im goingtoBilly retorted William with slow distinctness
And Im going to try to get therebeforeyouCAN And with this
extraordinary shotfor Williamhe left the house

William went to Billy as fast as steam could carry him He found her in
her little drawingroom listlessly watching with Aunt Hannah the game of
chess that Bertram and Marie were playing

Billy you poor dear child come here he said abruptly as soon as
the excitement of his unexpected arrival had passed I want to talk to
you And he led the way to the veranda which he knew would be silent
and deserted

To talk tome murmured Billy as she wonderingly came to his side a
startled questioning in her wide dark eyes



CHAPTER XLI

THE CROOKED MADE STRAIGHT


William did not reenter the house after his talk with Billy on the
veranda

I will go down the steps and around by the rose garden to the street
dear he said Id rather not go in now Just make my adieus please
and say that I couldnt stay any longer And nowgoodby His eyes as
they looked down at her were moist and very tender His lips trembled a
little but they smiled and there was a look of newborn peace and joy
on his face

Billy too was smiling though wistfully The frightened questioning
had gone from her eyes leaving only infinite tenderness

You are sure itit is all rightnow she stammered

Very sure little girl and its the first time it has been right for
weeks Billy that was very dear of you and I love you for it but
think how nearhow perilously near you came to lifelong misery

But I thoughtyou wanted meso much she smiled shyly

And I did and I dofor a daughter You dont doubt that NOW

No oh no laughed Billy softly and to her face came a happy look
of relief as she finished And Ill be so glad to bethe daughter

For some minutes after the man had gone Billy stood by the steps where
he had left her She was still there when Bertram came to the veranda
door and spoke to her

Billy I saw William go by the window so I knew you were alone May I
speak to you

The girl turned with a start

Why of course What is itbut I thought you were playing Where is
Marie

The game is finished besidesBilly why are you always asking
me lately where Marie is as if I were her keeper or she mine he
demanded with a touch of nervous irritation

Why nothing Bertram smiled Billy a little wearily only that you
were playing together a few minutes ago and I wondered where she had
gone

A few minutes ago echoed Bertram with sudden bitterness Evidently
the time passed swiftly with you Billy William was out here MORE than
an hour

WhyBertram

Yes I know Ive no business to say that of course sighed the man
but Billy thats why I came outbecause I must speak to you this
once Wont you come and sit down please he implored despairingly

Why Bertram murmured Billy again faintly as she turned toward the
vineshaded corner and sat down Her eyes were startled A swift color
had come to her cheeks

Billy began the man in a sternly controlled voice please let me
speak this once and dont try to stop me You may think for a moment
that its disloyal to William if you listen but it isnt Theres this
much due to methat you let me speak now Billy I cant stand it
Ive tried but its no use Ive got to go away and its right that I
should Im not the only one that thinks so either Marie does too

MARIE

Yes I talked it all over with her Shes known for a long time how
its been with me how I caredfor you

Marie Youve told Marie that gasped Billy

Yes Surely you dont mind Maries knowing went on Bertram
dejectedly And shes been so good to me and tried tohelp me

Bertram was not looking at Billy now If he had been he would have seen
the incredulous joy come into her face His eyes were moodily fixed on
the floor

And so Billy Ive come to tell you Im going away he continued
after a moment Ive got to go I thought once when I first talked
with you of William that you didnt know your own heart that you
didnt really care for him I was even fool enough to think thatthat
it would be I to whom youd turnsome day And so I stayed But I
stayed honorably Billy YOU know that You know that I havent once
forgottennot once that I was only Williams brother I promised you
Id be thatand I have been havent I

Billy nodded silently Her face was turned away

But Billy I cant do it any longer Ive got to ask for my promise
back and then of course I cant stay

But youyou dont have to goaway murmured the girl faintly

Bertram sprang to his feet His face was white

Billy he cried standing tall and straight before her Billy I
love every touch of your hand every glance of your eye every word that
falls from your lips Do you think I can staynow I want my promise
back When Im no longer Williams brotherthen Ill go

But you dont have to have it backthat is you dont have to have it
at all stammered Billy flushing adorably She too was on her feet
now

Billy what do you mean

Dont you see II HAVE turned she faltered breathlessly holding
out both her hands

Even then in spite of the great light that leaped to his eyes Bertram
advanced only a single step

ButWilliam he questioned unbelievingly

It WAS a mistake just as you thought We know nowboth of us We
dont either of us care for the otherthat way AndBertram I think
it HAS been youall the time only I didnt know

Billy Billy choked Bertram in a voice shaken with emotion He opened
his arms then wideand Billy walked straight into them



CHAPTER XLII

THE END OF THE STORY


It was two days after Billys new happiness had come to her that Cyril
came home He went very soon to see Billy

The girl was surprised at the change in his appearance He had grown
thin and haggard looking and his eyes were somber He moved restlessly
about the room for a time finally seating himself at the piano and
letting his fingers slip from one mournful little melody to another
Then with a discordant crash he turned

Billy do you think any girl would marryme he demanded

Why Cyril

There now please dont begin that he begged fretfully I realize
of course that Im a very unlikely subject for matrimony You made me
understand that clearly enough last winter

Lastwinter

Cyril raised his eyebrows

Oh I came to you for a little encouragement and to make a
confession he said I made the confessionbut I didnt get the
encouragement

Billy changed color She thought she knew what he meant but at the
same time she couldnt understand why he should wish to refer to that
conversation now

Aconfession she repeated hesitatingly

Yes I told you that Id begun to doubt my being such a womanhater
after all I intimated that YOUD begun the softening process and that
then Id found a certain other young woman who hadwell who had kept
up the good work

Oh cried Billy suddenly with a peculiar intonation Ohh Then she
laughed softly

Well that was the confession resumed Cyril Then I came out
flatfooted and said that I wanted to marry herbut there is where I
didnt get the encouragement

Indeed Im afraid I wasnt very considerate stammered Billy

No you werent agreed Cyril moodily I didnt know but now his
voice softened a littlewith this new happiness of yours and Bertrams
thatyou might find a little encouragement for me

And I will cried Billy promptly Tell me about her

I didlast winter reproached the man and you were sure I was
deceiving myself You drew the gloomiest sort of picture of the misery I
would take with a wife

I did Billy was laughing very merrily now

Yes You said shed always be talking and laughing when I wanted to be
quiet and that shed want to drag me out to parties and plays when
I wanted to stay at home andoh lots of things I tried to make
it clear to you thatthat this little woman wasnt that sort But I
couldnt finished Cyril gloomily

But of course she isnt declared Billy with quick sympathy II
didnt knowWHATI wastalking about she added with emphatic
distinctness Then she smiled to think how little Cyril knew how very
true those words were Tell me about her she begged again I
know she must be very lovely and brilliant and of course a wonderful
musician YOU couldnt choose any one else

To her surprise Cyril turned abruptly and began to play again A nervous
little staccato scherzo fell from his fingers but it dropped almost at
once into a quieter melody and ended with something that sounded very
much like the last strain of Home Sweet Home Then he wheeled about
on the piano stool

Billy thats exactly where youre wrongI DONT want that kind of
wife I dont want a brilliant one andnow Billy this sounds like
horrible heresy I know but its trueI dont care whether she can
play or not but I should prefer that she shouldnt playmuch

Why Cyril Henshawand you with your music As if you could be
contented with a woman like that

Oh I want her to like music of course modified Cyril but I dont
care to have her MAKE it Billy do you know Youll laugh of course
but my picture of a wife is always one thing a room with a table and
a shaded lamp and a little woman beside it with the light on her hair
and a great basket of sewing beside her You see I AM domestic he
finished a little defiantly

I should say you were laughed Billy And have you found herthis
little woman who is to do nothing but sit and sew in the circle of the
shaded lamp

Yes Ive found her but Im not at all sure shes found me Thats
where I want your help Oh I dont mean of course he added that
shes got to sit under that lamp all the time Its only thatthat I
hope she likes that sort of thing

Anddoes she

Yes that is I think she does smiled Cyril Anyhow she told me
once thatthat the things she liked best to do in all the world were to
mend stockings and to make puddings

Billy sprang to her feet with a little cry Now indeed had Cyril kept
his promise and made many things clear to her

Cyril come here she cried tremulously leading the way to the open
veranda door The next moment Cyril was looking across the lawn to the
little summerhouse in the midst of Billys rose garden In full view
within the summerhouse sat Mariesewing

Go Cyril shes waiting for you smiled Billy mistily The lights
only the sun to be sure and maybe there isnt a whole basket of sewing
there ButSHES there

Youveguessed then breathed Cyril

Ive not guessedI know Andits all right

You mean Only Cyrils pleading eyes finished the question

Yes Im sure she does nodded Billy And then she added under her
breath as the man passed swiftly down the steps Marie Henshaw
indeed So twas Cyril all the timeand never Bertramwho was the
inspiration of that bit of paper giveaway

When she turned back into the room she came face to face with Bertram

I spoke dear but you didnt hear he said as he hurried forward
with outstretched hands

Bertram greeted Billy with surprising irrelevance and they all
lived happily ever afterthey DID Isnt that always the ending to the
storya love story

Of course said Bertram with emphasisOUR love story

And theirs supplemented Billy softly but Bertram did not hear that
