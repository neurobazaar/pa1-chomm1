ACT I

SCENE I

 The scene is a welllighted and large oakpanelled hall with
 an air of being lived in and a broad oak staircase The
 diningroom drawingroom billiardroom all open into it and
 under the staircase a door leads to the servants quarters In
 a huge fireplace a log fire is burning There are tigerskins
 on the floor horns on the walls and a writingtable against
 the wall opposite the fireplace FREDA STUDDENHAM a pretty
 pale girl with dark eyes in the black dress of a ladysmaid
 is standing at the foot of the staircase with a bunch of white
 roses in one hand and a bunch of yellow roses in the other A
 door closes above and SIR WILLIAM CHESHIRE in evening dress
 comes downstairs He is perhaps fiftyeight of strong build
 rather bullnecked with grey eyes and a wellcoloured face
 whose choleric autocracy is veiled by a thin urbanity He
 speaks before he reaches the bottom

SIR WILLIAM Well Freda Nice roses Who are they for

FREDA My lady told me to give the yellow to Mrs Keith Sir
William and the white to Miss Lanfarne for their first evening

SIR WILLIAM Capital Passing on towards the drawingroom Your
father coming up tonight

FREDA Yes

SIR WILLIAM Be good enough to tell him I specially want to see him
here after dinner will you

FREDA Yes Sir William

SIR WILLIAM By the way just ask him to bring the gamebook in if
hes got it

 He goes out into the drawingroom and FREDA stands restlessly
 tapping her foot against the bottom stair With a flutter of
 skirts CHRISTINE KEITH comes rapidly down She is a
 nicelooking freshcoloured young woman in a lownecked dress

CHRISTINE Hullo Freda How are YOU

FREDA Quite well thank you Miss ChristineMrs Keith I mean
My lady told me to give you these

CHRISTINE Taking the roses Oh Thanks How sweet of mother

FREDA In a quick toneless voice The others are for Miss Lanfarne
My lady thought white would suit her better

CHRISTINE They suit you in that black dress

 FREDA lowers the roses quickly

What do you think of Joans engagement

FREDA Its very nice for her

CHRISTINE I say Freda have they been going hard at rehearsals

FREDA Every day Miss Dot gets very cross stagemanaging

CHRISTINE I do hate learning a part Thanks awfully for unpacking
Any news

FREDA In the same quick dull voice The underkeeper Dunning
wont marry Rose Taylor after all

CHRISTINE What a shame But I say thats serious I thought there
wasshe wasI mean

FREDA Hes taken up with another girl they say

CHRISTINE Too bad Pinning the roses Dyou know if Mr Bills
come

FREDA With a swift upward look Yes by the sixforty

 RONALD KEITH comes slowly down a weathered firmlipped man in
 evening dress with eyelids half drawn over his keen eyes and
 the air of a horseman

KEITH Hallo Roses in December I say Freda your father missed
a wigging this morning when they drew blank at Warnhams spinney
Wheres that litter of little foxes

FREDA Smiling faintly I expect father knows Captain Keith

KEITH You bet he does Emigration Or thin air What

CHRISTINE Studdenhamd never shoot a fox Ronny Hes been here
since the flood

KEITH Theres more ways of killing a cateh Freda

CHRISTINE Moving with her husband towards the drawingroom Young
Dunning wont marry that girl Ronny

KEITH Phew Wouldnt be in his shoes then Sir Williamll never
keep a servant whos made a scandal in the village old girl Bill
come

 As they disappear from the hall JOHN LATTER in a clergymans
 evening dress comes sedately downstairs a tall rather pale
 young man with something in him as it were both of heaven
 and a drawingroom He passes FREDA with a formal little nod
 HAROLD a freshcheeked cheerylooking youth comes down three
 steps at a time

HAROLD Hallo Freda Patience on the monument Lets have a
sniff For Miss Lanfarne Bill come down yet

FREDA No Mr Harold

 HAROLD crosses the hall whistling and follows LATTER into the
 drawingroom There is the sound of a scuffle above and a
 voice crying Shut up Dot And JOAN comes down screwing her
 head back She is pretty and small with large clinging eyes

JOAN Am I all right behind Freda That beast Dot

FREDA Quite Miss Joan

 DOTs face like a full moon appears over the upper banisters
 She too comes running down a frank figure with the face of a
 rebel

DOT You little being

JOAN Flying towards the drawingroam is overtaken at the door
Oh Dot Youre pinching

 As they disappear into the drawingroom MABEL LANFARNE a tall
 girl with a rather charming Irish face comes slowly down And
 at sight of her FREDAs whole figure becomes set and meaningfull

FREDA For you Miss Lanfarne from my lady

MABEL In whose speech is a touch of wilful Irishry How sweet
Fastening the roses And how are you Freda

FREDA Very well thank you

MABEL And your father Hope hes going to let me come out with the
guns again

FREDA Stolidly Hell be delighted Im sure

MABEL Yees I havent forgotten his facelast time

FREDA You stood with Mr Bill Hes better to stand with than Mr
Harold or Captain Keith

MABEL He didnt touch a feather that day

FREDA People dont when theyre anxious to do their best

 A gong sounds And MABEL LANFARNE giving FREDA a rather
 inquisitive stare moves on to the drawingroom Left alone
 without the roses FREDA still lingers At the slamming of a
 door above and hasty footsteps she shrinks back against the
 stairs BILL runs down and comes on her suddenly He is a
 tall goodlooking edition of his father with the same stubborn
 look of veiled choler

BILL Freda And as she shrinks still further back whats the
matter Then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away
from her Arent you glad to see me

FREDA Ive something to say to you Mr Bill After dinner

BILL Mister

 She passes him and rushes away upstairs And BILL who stands
 frowning and looking after her recovers himself sharply as the
 drawingroom door is opened and SIR WILLIAM and MISS LANFARNE
 come forth followed by KEITH DOT HAROLD CHRISTINE LATTER
 and JOAN all leaning across each other and talking By
 herself behind them comes LADY CHESHIRE a refinedlooking
 woman of fifty with silvery dark hair and an expression at
 once gentle and ironic They move across the hall towards the
 diningroom

SIR WILLIAM Ah Bill

MABEL How do you do

KEITH How are you old chap

DOT gloomily Do you know your part

HAROLD Hallo old man

CHRISTINE gives her brother a flying kiss JOAN and LATTER pause and
look at him shyly without speech

BILL Putting his hand on JOANs shoulder Good luck you two
Well mother

LADY CHESHIRE Well my dear boy Nice to see you at last What a
long time

 She draws his arm through hers and they move towards the
 diningroom

 The curtain falls

 The curtain rises again at once



SCENE II

 CHRISTINE LADY CHESHIRE DOT MABEL LANFARNE
 and JOAN are returning to the hall after dinner

CHRISTINE in a low voice Mother is it true about young Dunning
and Rose Taylor

LADY CHESHIRE Im afraid so dear

CHRISTINE But cant they be

DOT Ah ahh CHRISTINE and her mother are silent My child Im
not the young person

CHRISTINE No of course notonlynodding towards JOAN and
Mable

DOT Look here This is just an instance of what I hate

LADY CHESHIRE My dear Another one

DOT Yes mother and dont you pretend you dont understand
because you know you do

CHRISTINE Instance Of what

JOAN and MABEL have ceased talking and listen still at the fire

DOT Humbug of course Why should you want them to marry if hes
tired of her

CHRISTINE Ironically Well If your imagination doesnt carry you
as far as that

DOT When people marry do you believe they ought to be in love with
each other

CHRISTINE With a shrug Thats not the point

DOT Oh Were you in love with Ronny

CHRISTINE Dont be idiotic

DOT Would you have married him if you hadnt been

CHRISTINE Of course not

JOAN Dot You are

DOT Hallo my little snipe

LADY CHESHIRE Dot dear

DOT Dont shut me up mother To JOAN Are you in love with
John JOAN turns hurriedly to the fire Would you be going to
marry him if you were not

CHRISTINE You are a brute Dot

DOT Is Mabel in love withwhoever she is in love with

MABEL And I wonder who that is

DOT Well would you marry him if you werent

MABEL No I would not

DOT Now mother did you love father

CHRISTINE Dot you really are awful

DOT Rueful and detached Well it is a bit too thick perhaps

JOAN Dot

DOT Well mother did youI mean quite calmly

LADY CHESHIRE Yes dear quite calmly

DOT Would you have married him if you hadnt LADY CHESHIRE shakes
her head Then were all agreed

MABEL Except yourself

DOT Grimly Even if I loved him he might think himself lucky if I
married him

MABEL Indeed and Im not so sure

DOT Making a face at her What I was going to

LADY CHESHIRE But dont you think dear youd better not

DOT Well I wont say what I was going to say but what I do say
isWhy the devil

LADY CHESHIRE Quite so Dot

DOT A little disconcerted If theyre tired of each other they
ought not to marry and if fathers going to make them

CHRISTINE You dont understand in the least Its for the sake of
the

DOT Out with it Old Sweetness The approaching infant God bless
it

 There is a sudden silence for KEITH and LATTER are seen coming
 from the diningroom

LATTER That must be so Ronny

KEITH No John not a bit of it

LATTER You dont think

KEITH Good Gad who wants to think after dinner

DOT Come on Lets play pool She turns at the billiardroom
door Look here Rehearsal tomorrow is directly after breakfast
from Eccles enters breathless to the end

MABEL Whatever made you choose Caste DOT You know its awfully
difficult

DOT Because its the only play thats not too advanced The girls
all go into the billiardroom

LADY CHESHIRE Wheres Bill Ronny

KEITH With a grimace I rather think Sir William and he are in
Committee of SupplyMemSahib

LADY CHESHIRE Oh

 She looks uneasily at the diningroom then follows the girls
 out

LATTER In the tone of one resuming an argument There cant be
two opinions about it Ronny Young Dunnings refusal is simply
indefensible

KEITH I dont agree a bit John

LATTER Of course if you wont listen

KEITH Clipping a cigar Draw it mild my dear chap Weve had
the whole thing over twice at least

LATTER My point is this

KEITH Regarding LATTER quizzically with his halfclosed eyes
I knowI knowbut the point is how far your point is simply
professional

LATTER If a man wrongs a woman he ought to right her again
Theres no answer to that

KEITH It all depends

LATTER Thats rank opportunism

KEITH Rats Look hereOh hang it John one cant argue this out
with a parson

LATTER Frigidly Why not

HAROLD Who has entered from the diningroom Pull devil pull
baker

KEITH Shut up Harold

LATTER To play the game is the religion even of the Army

KEITH Exactly but what is the game

LATTER What else can it be in this case

KEITH Youre too puritanical young John You cant help itline
of country laid down for you All draghuntin What

LATTER With concentration Look here

HAROLD Imitating the action of a man pulling at a horses head
Come hup I say you hugly beast

KEITH To LATTER Youre not going to draw me old chap You
dont see where youd land us all He smokes calmly

LATTER How do you imagine vice takes its rise From precisely this
sort of thing of young Dunnings

KEITH From human nature I should have thought John I admit that
I dont like a fellows leavin a girl in the lurch but I dont see
the use in drawin hard and fast rules You only have to break em
Sir William and you would just tie Dunning and the girl up together
willynilly to save appearances and ten to one but therell be the
deuce to pay in a years time You can take a horse to the water
you cant make him drink

LATTER I entirely and absolutely disagree with you

HAROLD Good old John

LATTER At all events we know where your principles take you

KEITH Rather dangerously Where please HAROLD turns up his
eyes and points downwards Dry up Harold

LATTER Did you ever hear the story of Faust

KEITH Now look here John with all due respect to your cloth and
all the politeness in the world you may go toblazes

LATTER Well I must say Ronnyof all the rude boorsHe turns
towards the billiardroom

KEITH Sorry I smashed the glass old chap

 LATTER passes out There comes a mingled sound through the
 opened door of female voices laughter and the click of
 billiard balls dipped of by the sudden closing of the door

KEITH Impersonally Deuced odd the way a parson puts ones back
up Because you know I agree with him really young Dunning ought to
play the game and I hope Sir Williamll make him

 The butler JACKSON has entered from the door under the stairs
 followed by the keeper STUDDENHAM a man between fifty and
 sixty in a fullskirted coat with big pockets cord breeches
 and gaiters he has a steady self respecting weathered face
 with blue eyes and a short grey beard which has obviously once
 been red

KEITH Hullo Studdenham

STUDDENHAM Touching his forehead Evenin Captain Keith

JACKSON Sir William still in the diningroom with Mr Bill sir

HAROLD With a grimace He is Jackson

 JACKSON goes out to the diningroom

KEITH Youve shot no pheasants yet Studdenham

STUDDENHAM No Sir Only birds Well be doin the spinneys and
the home covert while youre down

KEITH I say talkin of spinneys

 He breaks off sharply and goes out with HAROLD into the
 billiardroom SIR WILLIAM enters from the diningroom
 applying a gold toothpick to his front teeth

SIR WILLIAM Ah Studdenham Bad business this about young
Dunning

STUDDENHAM Yes Sir William

SIR WILLIAM He definitely refuses to marry her

STUDDENHAM He does that

SIR WILLIAM That wont do you know What reason does he give

STUDDENHAM Wont say other than that he dont want no more to do
with her

SIR WILLIAM God bless me Thats not a reason I cant have a
keeper of mine playing fast and loose in the village like this
Turning to LADY CHESHIRE who has come in from the billiardroom
That affair of young Dunnings my dear

LADY CHESHIRE Oh Yes Im so sorry Studdenham The poor girl

STUDDENHAM Respectfully Fancy hes got a feeling shes not his
equal now my lady

LADY CHESHIRE To herself Yes I suppose he has made her his
superior

SIR WILLIAM What Eh Quite Quite I was just telling
Studdenham the fellow must set the matter straight We cant have
open scandals in the village If he wants to keep his place he must
marry her at once

LADY CHESHIRE To her husband in a low voice Is it right to force
them Do you know what the girl wishes Studdenham

STUDDENHAM Shows a spirit my ladysays shell have himwillin
or not

LADY CHESHIRE A spirit I see If they marry like that theyre
sure to be miserable

SIR WILLIAM What Doesnt follow at all Besides my dear you
ought to know by this time theres an unwritten law in these
matters Theyre perfectly well aware that when there are
consequences they have to take them

STUDDENHAM Some o these young people my lady they dont put two
and two together no more than an old cock pheasant

SIR WILLIAM Ill give him till tomorrow If he remains obstinate
hell have to go hell get no character Studdenham Let him know
what Ive said I like the fellow hes a good keeper I dont want
to lose him But this sort of thing I wont have He must toe the
mark or take himself off Is he up here tonight

STUDDENHAM Hangin partridges Sir William Will you have him in

SIR WILLIAM Hesitating Yesyes Ill see him

STUDDENHAM Goodnight to you my lady

LADY CHESHIRE Fredas not looking well Studdenham

STUDDENHAM Shes a bit pernickitty with her food thats where it
is

LADY CHESHIRE I must try and make her eat

SIR WILLIAM Oh Studdenham Well shoot the home covert first
What did we get last year

STUDDENHAM Producing the gamebook but without reference to it
Two hundred and fiftythree pheasants eleven hares fiftytwo
rabbits three woodcock sundry

SIR WILLIAM Sundry Didnt include a fox did it Gravely I was
seriously upset this morning at Warnhams spinney

SUDDENHAM Very gravely You dont say Sir William that
fouryearold he du look a handful

SIR WILLIAM With a sharp look You know well enough what I mean

STUDDENHAM Unmoved Shall I send young Dunning Sir William

 SIR WILLIAM gives a short sharp nod and STUDDENHAM retires by
 the door under the stairs

SIR WILLIAM Old fox

LADY CHESHIRE Dont be too hard on Dunning Hes very young

SIR WILLIAM Patting her arm My dear you dont understand young
fellows how should you

LADY CHESHIRE With her faint irony A husband and two sons not
counting Then as the door under the stairs is opened Bill now
do

SIR WILLIAM Ill be gentle with him Sharply Come in

 LADY CHESHIRE retires to the billiardroom She gives a look
 back and a half smile at young DUNNING a fair young man dressed
 in broom cords and leggings and holding his cap in his hand
 then goes out

SIR WILLIAM Evenin Dunning

DUNNING Twisting his cap Evenin Sir William

SIR WILLIAM Studdenhams told you what I want to see you about

DUNNING Yes Sir

SIR WILLIAM The things in your hands Take it or leave it I
dont put pressure on you I simply wont have this sort of thing on
my estate

DUNNING Id like to say Sir William that she He stops

SIR WILLIAM Yes I daresaySix of one and half a dozen of the
other Cant go into that

DUNNING No Sir William

SIR WILLIAM Im quite mild with you This is your first place If
you leave here youll get no character

DUNNING I never meant any harm sir

SIR WILLIAM My good fellow you know the custom of the country

DUNNING Yes Sir William but

SIR WILLIAM You should have looked before you leaped Im not
forcing you If you refuse you must go thats all

DUNNING Yes Sir William

SIR WILLIAM Well now go along and take a day to think it over

 BILL who has sauntered moody from the diningroom stands by the
 stairs listening Catching sight of him DUNNING raises his
 hand to his forelock

DUNNING Very good Sir William He turns fumbles and turns
again My old mothers dependent on me

SIR WILLIAM Now Dunning Ive no more to say
 Dunning goes sadly away under the stairs

SIR WILLIAM Following And look here Just understand this
 He too goes out

 BILL lighting a cigarette has approached the writingtable
 He looks very glum The billiardroom door is flung open
 MABEL LANFARNE appears and makes him a little curtsey

MABEL Against my will I am bidden to bring you in to pool

BILL Sorry Ive got letters

MABEL You seem to have become very conscientious

BILL Oh I dont know

MABEL Do you remember the last day of the covert shooting

BITS I do

MABEL Suddenly What a pretty girl Freda Studdenhams grown

BILL Has she

MABEL She walks in beauty

BILL Really Hadnt noticed

MABEL Have you been taking lessons in conversation

BILL Dont think so

MABEL Oh There is a silence Mr Cheshire

BILL Miss Lanfarne

MABEL Whats the matter with you Arent you rather queer
considering that I dont bite and was rather a pal

BILL Stolidly Im sorry

 Then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiardroom
 he sits down at the writingtable

LADY CHESHIRE Mabel dear do take my cue Wont you play too
Bill and try and stop Ronny hes too terrible

BILL Thanks Ive got these letters

MABEL taking the cue passes back into the billiardroom whence comes
out the sound of talk and laughter

LADY CHESHIRE Going over and standing behind her sons chair
Anything wrong darling

BILL Nothing thanks Suddenly I say I wish you hadnt asked
that girl here

LADY CHESHIRE Mabel Why Shes wanted for rehearsals I thought
you got on so well with her last Christmas

BILL With a sort of sullen exasperation A year ago

LADY CHESHIRE The girls like her so does your father personally I
must say I think shes rather nice and Irish

BILL Shes all right I daresay

 He looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be
 left alone But LADY CHESHIRE having seen that he is about to
 look at her is not looking at him

LADY CHESHIRE Im afraid your fathers been talking to you Bill

BILL He has

LADY CHESHIRE Debts Do try and make allowances With a faint
smile Of course he is a little

BILL He is

LADY CHESHIRE I wish I could

BILL Oh Lord Dont you get mixed up in it

LADY CHESHIRE It seems almost a pity that you told him

BILL He wrote and asked me point blank what I owed

LADY CHESHIRE Oh Forcing herself to speak in a casual voice
I happen to have a little money BillI think it would be simpler
if

BILL Now look here mother youve tried that before I cant help
spending money I never shall be able unless I go to the Colonies
or something of the kind

LADY CHESHIRE Dont talk like that dear

BILL I would for two straws

LADY CHESHIRE Its only because your father thinks such a lot of
the place and the name and your career The Cheshires are all like
that Theyve been here so long theyre allroot

BILL Deuced funny business my career will be I expect

LADY CHESHIRE Fluttering but restraining herself lest he should
see But Bill why must you spend more than your allowance

BILL Whyanything I didnt make myself

LADY CHESHIRE Im afraid we did that It was inconsiderate
perhaps

BILL Yes youd better have left me out

LADY CHESHIRE But why are you soOnly a little fuss about money

BILL Yees

LADY CHESHIRE Youre not keeping anything from me are you

BILL Facing her No He then turns very deliberately to the
writing things and takes up a pen I must write these letters
please

LADY CHESHIRE Bill if theres any real trouble you will tell me
wont you

BILL Theres nothing whatever

 He suddenly gets up and walks about LADY CHESHIRE too moves
 over to the fireplace and after an uneasy look at him turns to
 the fire Then as if trying to switch of his mood she changes
 the subject abruptly

LADY CHESHIRE Isnt it a pity about young Dunning Im so sorry
for Rose Taylor

 There is a silence Stealthily under the staircase FREDA has
 entered and seeing only BILL advances to speak to him

BILL Suddenly Oh wellyou cant help these things in the
country

 As he speaks FREDA stops dead perceiving that he is not alone
 BILL too catching sight of her starts

LADY CHESHIRE Still speaking to the fire It seems dreadful to
force him I do so believe in people doing things of their own
accord Then seeing FREDA standing so uncertainly by the stairs Do
you want me Freda

FREDA Only your cloak my lady Shall Ibegin it

 At this moment SIR WILLIAM enters from the drawingroom

LADY CHESHIRE Yes yes

SIR WILLIAM Genially Can you give me another five minutes Bill
Pointing to the billiardroom Well come directly my dear

 FREDA with a look at BILL has gone back whence she came and
 LADY CHESHIRE goes reluctantly away into the billiardroom

SIR WILLIAM I shall give young Dunning short shrift He moves
over to the fireplace and divides hip coattails Now about you
Bill I dont want to bully you the moment you come down but you
know this cant go on Ive paid your debts twice Shant pay them
this time unless I see a disposition to change your mode of life
A pause You get your extravagance from your mother Shes very
queerA pauseAll the Winterleighs are like that about money

BILL Mothers particularly generous if thats what you mean

SIR WILLIAM Drily We will put it that way A pause At the
present moment you owe as I understand it eleven hundred pounds

BILL About that

SIR WILLIAM Mere fleabite A pause Ive a proposition to make

BILL Wont it do tomorrow sir

SIR WILLIAM Tomorrow appears to be your motto in life

BILL Thanks

SIR WILLIAM Im anxious to change it today BILL looks at him in
silence Its time you took your position seriously instead of
hanging about town racing and playing polo and what not

BILL Go ahead

 At something dangerous in his voice SIR WILLIAM modifies his
 attitude

SIR WILLIAM The propositions very simple I cant suppose
anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you but
drily I mention it Marry a nice girl settle down and stand for
the division you can have the Dower House and fifteen hundred a
year and Ill pay your debts into the bargain If youre elected
Ill make it two thousand Plenty of time to work up the
constituency before we kick out these infernal Rads Carpetbagger
against you if you go hard at it in the summer itll be odd if you
dont manage to get in your three days a week next season You can
take Rocketer and that fouryearoldhes well up to your weight
fully eight and a half inches of bone Youll only want one other
And if Missif your wife means to hunt

BILL Youve chosen my wife then

SIR WILLIAM With a quick look I imagine youve some girl in
your mind

BILL Ah

SIR WILLIAM Used not to be unnatural at your age I married your
mother at twentyeight Here you are eldest son of a family that
stands for something The more I see of the times the more Im
convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to and
save the landmarks left Unless were true to our caste and
prepared to work for it the landed classes are going to go under to
this infernal democratic spirit in the air The outlooks very
serious Were threatened in a hundred ways If you mean business
youll want a wife When I came into the property I should have been
lost without your mother

BILL I thought this was coming

SIR WILLIAM With a certain geniality My dear fellow I dont
want to put a pistol to your head Youve had a slack rein so far
Ive never objected to your sowing a few wild oatsso long as you
erUnseen by SIR WILLIAM BILL makes a sudden movement Short of
thatat all events Ive not inquired into your affairs I can only
judge by theerpecuniary evidence youve been good enough to
afford me from time to time I imagine youve lived like a good many
young men in your positionIm not blaming you but theres a time
for all things

BILL Why dont you say outright that you want me to marry Mabel
Lanfarne

SITS WILLIAM Well I do Girls a nice one Good familygot a
little moneyrides well Isnt she goodlooking enough for you or
what

BILL Quite thanks

SIR WILLIAM I understood from your mother that you and she were on
good terms

BILL Please dont drag mother into it

SIR WILLIAM With dangerous politeness Perhaps youll be good
enough to state your objections

BILL Must we go on with this

SIR WILLIAM Ive never asked you to do anything for me before I
expect you to pay attention now Ive no wish to dragoon you into
this particular marriage If you dont care for Miss Lanfarne marry
a girl youre fond of

BILL I refuse

SIR WILLIAM In that case you know what to look out for With a
sudden rush of choler You young He checks himself and stands
glaring at BILL who glares back at him This means I suppose that
youve got some entanglement or other

BILL Suppose what you like sir

SITS WILLIAM I warn you if you play the blackguard

BILL You cant force me like young Dunning

 Hearing the raised voices LADY CHESHIRE has come back from the
 billiardroom

LADY CHESHIRE Closing the door What is it

SIR WILLIAM You deliberately refuse Go away Dorothy

LADY CHESHIRE Resolutely I havent seen Bill for two months

SIR WILLIAM What Hesitating Wellwe must talk it over again

LADY CHESHIRE Come to the billiardroom both of you Bill do
finish those letters

 With a deft movement she draws SIR WILLIAM toward the
 billiardroom and glances back at BILL before going out but he
 has turned to the writingtable When the door is closed BILL
 looks into the drawingroom them opens the door under the
 stairs and backing away towards the writingtable sits down
 there and takes up a pen FREDA who has evidently been
 waiting comes in and stands by the table

BILL I say this is dangerous you know

FREDA Yesbut I must

BILL Well thenWith natural recklessness Arent you going to
kiss me

 Without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry

BILL Do you know you havent seen me for eight weeks

FREDA Quitelong enoughfor you to have forgotten

BILL Forgotten I dont forget people so soon

FREDA No

BILL Whats the matter with you Freda

FREDA After a long look Itll never be as it was

BILL Jumping up How dyou mean

FREDA Ive got something for you She takes a diamond ring out of
her dress and holds it out to him Ive not worn it since Cromer

BILL Now look here

FREDA Ive had my holiday I shant get another in a hurry

BILL Freda

FREDA Youll be glad to be free That fortnights all you really
loved me in

BILL Putting his hands on her arms I swear

FREDA Between her teeth Miss Lanfarne need never know about me

BILL So thats it Ive told you a dozen timesnothings changed
 FREDA looks at him and smiles

BILL Oh very well If you will make yourself miserable

FREDA Everybody will be pleased

BILL At what

FREDA When you marry her

BILL This is too bad

FREDA Its what always happenseven when its not agentleman

BILL Thats enough

FREDA But Im not like that girl down in the village You neednt
be afraid Ill say anything whenit comes Thats what I had to
tell you

BILL What

FREDA I can keep a secret

BILL Do you mean this She bows her head

BILL Good God

FREDA Father brought me up not to whine Like the puppies when
they hold them up by their tails With a sudden break in her voice
Oh Bill

BILL With his head down seizing her hands Freda He breaks
away from her towards the fire Good God

 She stands looking at him then quietly slips away
 by the door under the staircase BILL turns to
 speak to her and sees that she has gone He
 walks up to the fireplace and grips the mantelpiece

BILL By Jove This is


 The curtain falls




ACT II


 The scene is LADY CHESHIREs morning room at ten oclock on the
 following day It is a pretty room with white panelled walls
 and chrysanthemums and carmine lilies in bowls A large bow
 window overlooks the park under a souwesterly sky A piano
 stands open a fire is burning and the mornings correspondence
 is scattered on a writingtable Doors opposite each other lead
 to the maids workroom and to a corridor LADY CHESHIRE is
 standing in the middle of the room looking at an opera cloak
 which FREDA is holding out

LADY CHESHIRE Well Freda suppose you just give it up

FREDA I dont like to be beaten

LADY CHESHIRE Youre not to worry over your work And by the way
I promised your father to make you eat more FREDA smiles

LADY CHESHIRE Its all very well to smile You want bracing up
Now dont be naughty I shall give you a tonic And I think you had
better put that cloak away

FREDA Id rather have one more try my lady

LADY CHESHIRE Sitting doom at her writingtable Very well

 FREDA goes out into her workroom as JACKSON comes in from the
 corridor

JACKSON Excuse me my lady Theres a young woman from the
village says you wanted to see her

LADY CHESHIRE Rose Taylor Ask her to come in Oh and Jackson
the car for the meet please at halfpast ten

 JACKSON having bowed and withdrawn LADY CHESHIRE rises with
 worked signs of nervousness which she has only just suppressed
 when ROSE TAYLOR a stolid country girl comes in and stands
 waiting by the door

LADY CHESHIRE Well Rose Do come in

 with a book of Caste in her hand arranges the room according
 to a diagram

ear and holds it forth Lets see you try

FREDA Borrow a real one Miss Joan There are some that dont

 abruptly and goes out

DOT Buck up Where are Bill and Harold To JOAN Go and find

 But BILL and HAROLD followed by LATTER are already in the
 doorway They come in and LATTER stumbling over the
 wastepaper basket takes it up to improve its position

DOT Drop that cradle John As he picks the footstool out of it
Leave the baby in Now then Bill you enter there She points to
the workroom door where BILL and MABEL range themselves close to the
piano while HAROLD goes to the window John get off the stage

MABEL Oh no Mr Latter

LATTER I dont in the least want to destroy the balance of the
scene but I do want to be clear about the spirit What is the
spirit

DOT With gloom Rollicking

LATTER Well I dont think so We shall run a great risk with

DOT Shall we Now look here

MABEL Softly to BILL Mr Cheshire

BILL Desperately Lets get on

DOT Waving LATTER back Begin begin At last
 But JACKSON has came in

JACKSON To CHRISTINE Studdenham says Mm if the young ladies

JOAN Starting up Oh come on John
 She flies towards the door followed by LATTER

DOT Gesticulating with her book Stop You
 CHRISTINE and HAROLD also rush past

DOT Despairingly First pick Tearing her hair Pigs Devils
 She rushes after them BILL and MABEL are left alone

MABEL Mockingly And dont you want one of the spaniel pups

BILL Painfully reserved and sullen and conscious of the workroom
door Cant keep a dog in town You can have one if you like The
breedings all right

MABEL Sixth Pick

BILL The girlsll give you one of theirs They only fancy they
want em

Mann Moving nearer to him with her hands clasped behind her You
know you remind me awfully of your father Except that youre not
nearly so polite I dont understand you Englishlords of the soil
The way you have of disposing of your females With a sudden change
of voice What was the matter with you last night Softly Wont
you tell me

BILL Nothing to tell

MABEL Ah no Mr Bill

BILL Almost succumbing to her voicethen sullenly Worried I
suppose

MABEL Returning to her mocking Quite got over it

BILL Dont chaff me please

MABEL You really are rather formidable

BILL Thanks

MABEL But you know I love to cross a field where theres a bull

BILL Really Very interesting

MABEL The way of their only seeing one thing at a time She moves
back as he advances And overturning people on the journey

BILL Hadnt you better be a little careful

MABEL And never to see the hedge until theyre stuck in it And
then straight from that hedge into the opposite one

BILL Savagely What makes you bait me this morning of all
mornings

MABEL The beautiful morning Suddenly It must be dull for poor
Freda working in there with all this fun going on

BILL Glancing at the door Fun you call it

MABEL To go back to younowMr Cheshire

BILL No

MABEL You always make me feel so Irish Is it because youre so
English dyou think Ah I can see him moving his ears Now hes
pawing the groundHes started

BILL Miss Lanfarne

MABEL Still backing away from him and drawing him on with her
eyes and smile You cant help coming after me Then with a sudden
change to a sort of sierra gravity Can you Youll feel that when
Ive gone

 They stand quite still looking into each others eyes and
 FREDA who has opened the door of the workroom stares at them

MABEL Seeing her Heres the stile Adieu Monsieur le taureau

 She puts her hand behind her opens the door and slips through
 leaving BILL to turn following the direction of her eyes and
 see FREDA with the cloak still in her hand

BILL Slowly walking towards her I havent slept all night

FREDA No

BILL Have you been thinking it over
 FREDA gives a bitter little laugh

BILL Dont We must make a plan Ill get you away I wont let
you suffer I swear I wont

FREDA That will be clever

BILL I wish to Heaven my affairs werent in such a mess

FREDA I shall beallright thank you

BILL You must think me a blackguard She shakes her head Abuse
mesay something Dont look like that

FREDA Were you ever really fond of me

BILL Of course I was I am now Give me your hands

 She looks at him then drags her hands from his and covers her
 face

BILL Clenching his fists Look here Ill prove it Then as
she suddenly flings her arms round his neck and clings to him
There there

 There is a click of a door handle They start away from each
 other and see LADY CHESHIRE regarding them

LADY CHESHIRE Without irony I beg your pardon

 She makes as if to withdraw from an unwarranted intrusion but
 suddenly turning stands with lips pressed together waiting

LADY CHESHIRE Yes

 FREDA has muffled her face But BILL turns and confronts his
 mother

BILL Dont say anything against her

LADY CHESHIRE Tries to speak to him and failsthen to FREDA
Pleasego

BILL Taking FREDAs arm No

 LADY CHESHIRE after a moments hesitation herself moves
 towards the door

BILL Stop mother

LADY CHESHIRE I think perhaps not

BILL Looking at FREDA who is cowering as though from a blow Its
a dd shame

LADY CHESHIRE It is

BILL With sudden resolution Its not as you think Im engaged
to be married to her

 FREDA gives him a wild stare and turns away

LADY CHESHIRE Looking from one to the other I dont think
Iquiteunderstand

BILL With the brutality of his mortification What I said was
plain enough

LADY CHESHIRE Bill

BILL I tell you I am going to marry her

LADY CHESHIRE To FREDA Is that true

 FREDA gulps and remains silent

BILL If you want to say anything say it to me mother

LADY CHESHIRE Gripping the edge of a little table Give me a
chair please BILL gives her a chair

LADY CHESHIRE To FREDA Please sit down too

 FREDA sits on the piano stool still turning her face away

LADY CHESHIRE Fixing her eyes on FREDA Now

BILL I fell in love with her And she with me

LADY CHESHIRE When

BILL In the summer

LADY CHESHIRE Ah

BILL It wasnt her fault

LADY CHESHIRE No

BILL With a sort of menace Mother

LADY CHESHIRE Forgive me I am not quite used to the idea You say
that youare engaged

BILL Yes

LADY CHESHIRE The reasons against such an engagement have occurred
to you I suppose With a sudden change of tone Bill what does it
mean

BILL If you think shes trapped me into this

LADY CHESHIRE I do not Neither do I think she has been trapped
I think nothing I understand nothing

BILL Grimly Good

LADY CHESHIRE How long has thisengagement lasted

BILL After a silence Two months

LADY CHESHIRE Suddenly This isthis is quite impossible

BILL Youll find it isnt

LADY CHESHIRE Its simple misery

BILL Pointing to the workroom Go and wait in there Freda

LADY CHESHIRE Quickly And are you still in love with her

 FREDA moving towards the workroom smothers a sob

BILL Of course I am

 FREDA has gone and as she goes LADY CHESHIRE rises suddenly
 forced by the intense feeling she has been keeping in hand

LADY CHESHIRE Bill Oh Bill What does it all mean BILL
looking from side to aide only shrugs his shoulders You are not in
love with her now Its no good telling me you are

BILL I am

LADY CHESHIRE Thats not exactly how you would speak if you were

BILL Shes in love with me

LADY CHESHIRE Bitterly I suppose so

BILL I mean to see that nobody runs her down

LADY CHESHIRE With difficulty Bill Am I a hard or mean woman

BILL Mother

BILL Ive told you that I am

LADY CHESHIRE You are not Almost fiercely I knowI know
theres more behind

BILL Thereisnothing

LADY CHESHIRE Baffled but unconvinced Do you mean that your love
for her has been just what it might have been for a lady

BILL Bitterly Why not

LADY CHESHIRE With painful irony It is not so as a rule

BILL Up to now Ive never heard you or the girls say a word against
Freda This isnt the moment to begin please

LADY CHESHIRE Solemnly All such marriages end in wretchedness
You havent a taste or tradition in common You dont know what
marriage is Day after day year after year Its no use being
sentimentalfor people brought up as we are to have different
manners is worse than to have different souls Besides its
poverty Your father will never forgive you and Ive practically
nothing What can you do You have no profession How are you
going to stand it with a woman who Its the little things

BILL I know all that thanks

LADY CHESHIRE Nobody does till theyve been through it Marriage
is hard enough when people are of the same class With a sudden
movement towards him Oh my dearbefore its too late

BILL After a struggle Its no good

LADY CHESHIRE Its not fair to her It can only end in her misery

BILL Leave that to me please

LADY CHESHIRE With an almost angry vehemence Only the very
finest can do such things And you dont even know what troubles
like

BILL Drop it please mother

LADY CHESHIRE Bill on your word of honour are you acting of your
own free will

BILL Breaking away from her I cant stand any more
 He goes out into the workroom

LADY CHESHIRE What in Gods name shall I do

 In her distress she walks up and doom the room then goes to the
 workroom door and opens it

LADY CHESHIRE Come in here please Freda

 After a seconds pause FREDA white and trembling appears in
 the doorway followed by BILL

LADY CHESHIRE No Bill I want to speak to her alone

 BILL does not move

LADY CHESHIRE Icily I must ask you to leave us

 BILL hesitates then shrugging his shoulders he touches FREDAs
 arms and goes back into the workroom closing the door There
 is silence

LADY CHESHIRE How did it come about

FREDA I dont know my lady

LADY CHESHIRE For heavens sake child dont call me that again
whatever happens She walks to the window and speaks from there
I know well enough how love comes I dont blame you Dont cry
But you see its my eldest son FREDA puts her hand to her
breast Yes I know Women always get the worst of these things
Thats natural But its not only you is it Does any one guess

FREDA No

LADY CHESHIRE Not even your father FREDA shakes her head Theres
nothing more dreadful than for a woman to hang like a stone round a
mans neck How far has it gone Tell me

FREDA I cant

LADY CHESHIRE Come

FREDA Iwont

LADY CHESHIRE Smiling painfully Wont give him away Both of
you the same Whats the use of that with me Look at me Wasnt

FREDA Hesalwaysbehavedlikeagentleman

LADY CHESHIRE Like a man you mean

FREDA It hasnt been his fault I love him so

 LADY CHESHIRE turns abruptly and begins to walk up and down the
 room Then stopping she looks intently at FREDA

LADY CHESHIRE I dont know what to say to you Its simple
madness It cant and shant go on

FREDA Sullenly I know Im not his equal but I amsomebody

LADY CHESHIRE Answering this first assertion of rights with a
sudden steeliness Does he love you now

FREDA Thats not fairits not fair

LADY CHESHIRE If men are like gunpowder Freda women are not If
youve lost him its been your own fault

FREDA But he does love me he must Its only four months

LADY CHESHIRE Looking down and speaking rapidly Listen to me
I love my son but I know himI know all his kind of man Ive
lived with one for thirty years I know the way their senses work
When they want a thing they must have it and thentheyre sorry

FREDA Sullenly Hes not sorry

LADY CHESHIRE Is his love big enough to carry you both over
everything You know it isnt

FREDA If I were a lady you wouldnt talk like that

LADY CHESHIRE If you were a lady thered be no trouble before
either of you Youll make him hate you

FREDA I wont believe it I could make him happyout there

LADY CHESHIRE I dont want to be so odious as to say all the things
you must know I only ask you to try and put yourself in our
position

FREDA Ah yes

LADY CHESHIRE You ought to know me better than to think Im purely
selfish

FREDA Would you like to put yourself in my position

LADY CHESHIRE What

FREDA Yes Just like Rose

LADY CHESHIRE In a low horrorstricken voice Oh

 There is a dead silence then going swiftly up to her she looks
 straight into FREDAs eyes

FREDA Meeting her gaze Oh Yesits the truth Then to Bill
who has come in from the workroom she gasps out I never meant to
tell

BILL Well are you satisfied

LADY CHESHIRE Below her breath This is terrible

BILL The Governor had better know

LADY CHESHIRE Oh no not yet

BILL Waiting wont cure it

 The door from the corridor is thrown open CHRISTINE and DOT run
 in with their copies of the play in their hands seeing that
 something is wrong they stand still After a look at his
 mother BILL turns abruptly and goes back into the workroom
 LADY CHESHIRE moves towards the window

JOAN Following her sisters The cars round Whats the matter

DOT Shut up

 SIR WILLIAMS voice is heard from the corridor calling
 Dorothy As LADY CHESHIRE passing her handkerchief over her
 face turns round he enters He is in full hunting dress
 wellweathered pink buckskins and mahogany tops

SIR WILLIAM Just off my dear To his daughters genially
Rehearsin What He goes up to FREDA holding out his gloved right

 FREDA buttons the glove LADY CHESHIRE and the girls watching
 in hypnotic silence

SIR WILLIAM Thank you Balmy as May scent ought to be
firstrate To LADY CHESHIRE Goodbye my dear Sampsons Gorse

 He goes out leaving the door open and as his footsteps and the
 chink of his spurs die away FREDA turns and rushes into the
 workroom

CHRISTINE Mother What

 But LADY CHESHIRE waves the question aside passes her daughter
 and goes out into the corridor The sound of a motor car is
 heard

JOAN Running to the window Theyve started Chris What is

MABEL Whats the matter

CHRISTINE Oh nothing

MABEL Really I am sorry Hesitating Is it bad enough for me to

CHRISTINE Oh no Mabel

DOT Sardonically I should think very likely

 While she is looking from face to face BILL comes in from the
 workroom He starts to walk across the room but stops and
 looks stolidly at the four girls

BILL Exactly Fact of the matter is Miss Lanfarne Im engaged to
my mothers maid

 No one moves or speaks Suddenly MABEL LANFARNE goes towards
 him holding out her hand BILL does not take her hand but
 bows Then after a swift glance at the girls faces MABEL goes
 out into the corridor and the three girls are left staring at
 their brother

BILL Coolly Thought you might like to know
 He too goes out into the corridor

CHRISTINE Great heavens

JOAN How awful

CHRISTINE I never thought of anything as bad as that

JOAN Oh Chris Something must be done

DOT Suddenly to herself Ha When Father went up to have his
glove buttoned

 There is a sound JACKSON has came in from the corridor

JACKSON To Dot If you please Miss Studdenhams brought up the
other two pups Hes just outside Will you kindly take a look at

CHRISTINE How ghastly

DOT Suddenly catching sight of the book in her hand Caste
 She gives vent to a short sharp laugh


 The curtain falls




ACT III

 It is five oclock of the same day The scene is the
 smokingroom with walls of Leander red covered by old
 steeplechase and hunting prints Armchairs encircle a high
 ferulered hearth in which a fire is burning The curtains are
 not yet drawn across mullioned windows but electric light is
 burning There are two doors leading the one to the
 billiardroom the other to a corridor BILL is pacing up and
 doom HAROLD at the fireplace stands looking at him with
 commiseration

BILL Whats the time

HAROLD Nearly five They wont be in yet if thats any
consolation Always a tough meetsoftly as the tiger said when he
ate the man

BILL By Jove Youre the only person I can stand within a mile of
me Harold

HAROLD Old boy Do you seriously think youre going to make it any
better by marrying her

 Bill shrugs his shoulders still pacing the room

BILL Look here Im not the sort that finds it easy to say things

HAROLD No old man

BILL But Ive got a kind of selfrespect though you wouldnt think
it

HAROLD My dear old chap

BILL This is about as lowdown a thing as one could have done I
supposeones own mothers maid weve known her since she was so
high I see it now thatIve got over the attack

HAROLD But heavens if youre no longer keen on her Bill Do
apply your reason old boy

 There is silence while BILL again paces up and dozen

BILL If you think I care two straws about the morality of the
thing

HAROLD Oh my dear old man Of course not

BILL Its simply that I shall feel such a dd skunk if I leave
her in the lurch with everybody knowing Try it yourself youd
soon see

HAROLD Poor old chap

BILL Its not as if shed tried to force me into it And shes a
soft little thing Why I ever made such a sickening ass of myself I
cant think I never meant

HAROLD No I know But dont do anything rash Bill keep your
head old man

BILL I dont see what loss I should be if I did clear out of the
country The sound of cannoning billiard balls is heard Whos
that knocking the balls about

HAROLD John I expect The sound ceases

BILL Hes coming in here Cant stand that

 As LATTER appears from the billiardroom he goes hurriedly out

LATTER Was that Bill

HAROLD Yes

LATTER Well

HAROLD Pacing up and down in his turn Rat in a cage is a fool to
him This is the sort of thing you read of in books John What
price your argument with Runny now Well its not too late for you

LATTER What do you mean

HAROLD You neednt connect yourself with this eccentric family

LATTER Im not a bounder Harold

HAROLD Good

LATTER Its terrible for your sisters

HAROLD Deuced lucky we havent a lot of people staying here Poor
mother John I feel awfully bad about this If something isnt
done pretty mess I shall be in

LATTER How

come to me

LATTER Oh

HAROLD Poor old Bill I say the play Nemesis What Moral
Caste dont matter Got us fairly on the hop

LATTER Its too bad of Bill It really is Hes behaved
disgracefully

HAROLD Warningly Well There are thousands of fellows whod
never dream of sticking to the girl considering what it means

LATTER Perfectly disgusting

HAROLD Hang you John Havent you any human sympathy Dont you
know how these things come about Its like a spark in a strawyard

LATTER One doesnt take lighted pipes into strawyards unless ones
an idiot or worse

HAROLD Hm With a grin Youre not allowed tobacco In the
good old days no one would hive thought anything of this My
greatgrandfather

LATTER Spare me your greatgrandfather

HAROLD I could tell you of at least a dozen men I know whove been
through this same business and got off scotfree and now because
Bills going to play the game itll smash him up

LATTER Why didnt he play the game at the beginning

HAROLD I cant stand your sort John When a thing like this
happens all you can do is to cry out Why didnt he Why didnt
she Whats to be donethats the point

LATTER Of course hell have to

HAROLD Ha

LATTER What do you mean bythat

HAROLD Look here John You feel in your bones that a marriagell

Now dont you

LATTER The whole thing isis most unfortunate

HAROLD By Jove I should think it was

 As he speaks CHRISTINE and KEITH Come in from the billiardroom
 He is still in splashed hunting clothes and looks exceptionally
 weathered thinlipped reticent He lights a cigarette and
 sinks into an armchair Behind them DOT and JOAN have come
 stealing in

CHRISTINE Ive told Ronny

JOAN This waiting for father to be told is awful

HAROLD To KEITH Where did you leave the old man

KEITH Clackenham Hell be home in ten minutes

discomfiture She walked into Gracely and sent herself a telegram

HAROLD Phew

 KEITH looking at JOAN slowly emits smoke and LATTER passing
 his arm through JOANS draws her away with him into the
 billiardroom

DOT Music Squeaks Ugh The whole things like a concertina

 They all turn as the door opens and a FOOTMAN enters with a
 tray of whiskey gin lemons and soda water In dead silence
 the FOOTMAN puts the tray down

HAROLD Forcing his voice Did you get a run Ronny As KEITH
nods What point

KEITH Eight mile

FOOTMAN Will you take tea sir

KEITH No thanks Charles

 In dead silence again the FOOTMAN goes out and they all look
 after him

HAROLD Below his breath Good Gad Thats a squeeze of it

HAROLD I wont take what Bill ought to have nor would any of you

CHRISTINE and DOT Of course not

KEITH Patting his wifes arm Hardly the point is it

DOT If it wasnt for mother Fredas just as much of a lady as

his head down Oh do try Its only fair to her and all of us

LADY CHESHIRE Painfully There are things one cant do

CHRISTINE But its Bill I know you can make her give him up if
youll only say all you can And after all whats coming wont
affect her as if shed been a lady Only you can do it mother Do
back me up all of you Its the only way

 Hypnotised by their private longing for what CHRISTINE has been
 urging they have all fixed their eyes on LADY CHESHIRE who
 looks from face to face and moves her hands as if in physical
 pain

CHRISTINE Softly Mother

 LADY CHESHIRE suddenly rises looking towards the billiardroom
 door listening They all follow her eyes She sits down
 again passing her hand over her lips as SIR WILLIAM enters
 His hunting clothes are splashed his face very grim and set
 He walks to the fore without a glance at any one and stands
 looking down into it Very quietly every one but LADY CHESHIRE
 steals away

LADY CHESHIRE What have you done

SIR WILLIAM You there

LADY CHESHIRE Dont keep me in suspense

SIR WILLIAM The fool My God Dorothy I didnt think I had a
blackguard for a son who was a fool into the bargain

LADY CHESHIRE Rising If he were a blackguard he would not be
what you call a fool

SIR WILLIAM After staring angrily makes her a slight bow Very
well

LADY CHESHIRE In a low voice Bill dont be harsh Its all too
terrible

SIR WILLIAM Sit down my dear
 She resumes her seat and he turns back to the fire

SIR WILLIAM In all my life Ive never been face to face with a
thing like this Gripping the mantelpiece so hard that his hands
and arms are seen shaking You ask me to be calm I am trying to be
Be good enough in turn not to take his part against me

LADY CHESHIRE Bill

SIR WILLIAM I am trying to think I understand that youve known
thispiece of news since this morning Ive known it ten minutes
Give me a little time please Then after a silence Wheres the

LADY CHESHIRE In the workroom

SIR WILLIAM Raising his clenched fist What in Gods name is he
about

LADY CHESHIRE What have you said to him

and walks up and down My family goes back to the thirteenth
century Nowadays they laugh at that I dont Nowadays they laugh

LADY CHESHIRE Beneath her breath Ive tried thatit doesnt

SIR WILLIAM This girl who was born on the estate had the run of
the housebrought up with money earned from menothing but kindness
from all of us shes broken the common rules of gratitude and
decencyshe lured him on I havent a doubt

LADY CHESHIRE To herself In a way I suppose

SIR WILLIAM What Its ruin Weve always been here Who the
deuce are we if we leave this place Dyou think we could stay Go
out and meet everybody just as if nothing had happened Goodbye to

business nothing can get over Ive seen it before As to that

LADY CHESHIRE I did before I knew what was in front of herI said

SIR WILLIAM What are you going to do thenfold your hands Then

titleI cant help My God Does that meet your wishes

LADY CHESHIRE With sudden fire Youve no right to put such an
alternative to me Id give ten years of my life to prevent this

SIR WILLIAM Then why cant you go to the girl She deserves no
consideration Its not a question of morality Morality be dd

LADY CHESHIRE But not selfrespect

SIR WILLIAM What Youre his mother

LADY CHESHIRE Ive tried I putting her hand to her throat cant

chance LADY CHESHIRE turns away

SIR WILLIAM In the whole course of our married life Dorothy Ive
never known you set yourself up against me I resent this I warn
youI resent it Send the girl to me Ill do it myself

 With a look back at him LADY CHESHIRE goes out into the
 corridor

SIR WILLIAM This is a nice end to my day

 He takes a small china cup from of the mantelpiece it breaks
 with the pressure of his hand and falls into the fireplace
 While he stands looking at it blankly there is a knock

SIR WILLIAM Come in

 FREDA enters from the corridor

SIR WILLIAM Ive asked you to be good enough to come in order
thatpointing to chairYou may sit down

 But though she advances two or three steps she does not sit
 down

SIR WILLIAM This is a sad business

FREDA Below her breath Yes Sir William

SIR WILLIAM Becoming conscious of the depths of feeling before
him Ierare you attached to my son

FREDA In a whisper Yes

SIR WILLIAM Its very painful to me to have to do this He turns
away from her and speaks to the fire I sent for youtoask
quickly How old are you

FREDA Twentytwo

SIR WILLIAM More resolutely Do you expect me to sanction such a
mad idea as a marriage

FREDA I dont expect anything

SIR WILLIAM You knowyou havent earned the right to be considered

FREDA Not yet

SIR WILLIAM What That oughtnt to help you On the contrary Now
brace yourself up and listen to me

 She stands waiting to hear her sentence SIR WILLIAM looks at
 her and his glance gradually wavers

SIR WILLIAM Ive not a word to say for my son Hes behaved like a
scamp

FREDA Oh no

SIR WILLIAM With a silencing gesture At the same timeWhat
made you forget yourself Youve no excuse you know

FREDA No

SIR WILLIAM Youll deserve all youll get Confound it To expect
me toIts intolerable Do you know where my son is

FREDA Faintly I think hes in the billiardroom with my lady

SIR WILLIAM With renewed resolution I wanted toto put it to
youas aas awhat Seeing her stand so absolutely motionless
looking at him he turns abruptly and opens the billiardroom door
Ill speak to him first Come in here please To FREDA Go in and
wait

 LADY CHESHIRE and BILL Come in and FREDA passing them goes
 into the billiardroom to wait

SIR WILLIAM Speaking with a pause between each sentence Your
mother and I have spoken of thiscalamity I imagine that even you
have some dim perception of the monstrous nature of it I must tell
you this If you do this mad thing you fend for yourself Youll
receive nothing from me now or hereafter I consider that only due
to the position our family has always held here Your brother will
take your place We shallget on as best we can without you There
is a dead silence till he adds sharply Well

BILL I shall marry her

LADY CHESHIRE Oh Bill Without lovewithout anything

BILL All right mother To SIR WILLIAM youve mistaken your man
sir Because Im a rotter in one way Im not necessarily a rotter
in all You put the butt end of the pistol to Dunnings head
yesterday you put the other end to mine today Well He turns
round to go out Let the dd thing off

LADY CHESHIRE Bill

BILL Turning to her Im not going to leave her in the lurch

SIR WILLIAM Do me the justice to admit that I have not attempted to
persuade you to

BILL No youve chucked me out I dont see what else you could
have done under the circumstances Its quite all right But if you
wanted me to throw her over father you went the wrong way to work
thats all neither you nor I are very good at seeing consequences

SIR WILLIAM Do you realise your position

BILK Grimly Ive a fair notion of it

SIR WILLIAM With a sudden outburst You have nonenot the
faintest brought up as youve been

BILL I didnt bring myself up

SIR WILLIAM With a movement of uncontrolled anger to which his son
responds Youungrateful young dog

LADY CHESHIRE How can youboth
They drop their eyes and stand silent

SIR WILLIAM With grimly suppressed emotion I am speaking under the
stress of very great painsome consideration is due to me This is
a disaster which I never expected to have to face It is a matter
which I naturally can never hope to forget I shall carry this down
to my death We shall all of us do that I have had the misfortune
all my life to believe in our position hereto believe that we
counted for somethingthat the country wanted us I have tried to
do my duty by that position I find in one moment that it is gone
smokegone My philosophy is not equal to that To countenance
this marriage would be unnatural

BILL I know Im sorry Ive got her into thisI dont see any
other way out Its a bad business for me father as well as for
you

 He stops seeing that JACKSON has route in and is standing
 there waiting

JACKSON Will you speak to Studdenham Sir William Its about
young Dunning

 After a moment of dead silence SIR WILLIAM nods and the butler
 withdraws

BILL Stolidly Hed better be told

SIR WILLIAM He shall be

 STUDDENHAM enters and touches his forehead to them all with a
 comprehensive gesture

STUDDENHAM Good evenin my lady Evenin Sir William

STUDDENHAM Glad to be able to tell you the young mans to do the
proper thing Asked me to let you know Sir William Bannsll be up
next Sunday Struck by the silence he looks round at all three in
turn and suddenly seeing that LADY CHESHIRE is shivering Beg
pardon my lady youre shakin like a leaf

BILL Blurting it out Ive a painful piece of news for you
Studdenham Im engaged to your daughter Were to be married at
once

STUDDENHAM Idontunderstand yousir

BILL The fact is Ive behaved badly but I mean to put it

STUDDENHAM TO SIR WILLIAM YOU tell me that my daughters in the
position of that girl owing to your son Men ha been shot for less

BILL If you like to have a pot at me Studdenham youre welcome

STUDDENHAM Averting his eyes from BILL at the sheer idiocy of this
sequel to his words Ive been in your service five and twenty years
Sir William but this is man to manthis is

SIR WILLIAM I dont deny that Studdenham

STUDDENHAM With eyes shifting in sheer anger Notwouldnt be
very easy Did I understand him to say that he offers her marriage

SIR WILLIAM You did

STUDDENHAM Into his beard Wellthats something Moving his
hands as if wringing the neck of a bird Im tryin to see the rights
o this

SIR WILLIAM Bitterly Youve all your work cut out for you
Studdenham

 Again STUDDENHAM makes the unconscious wringing movement with
 his hands

LADY CHESHIRE Turning from it with a sort of horror Dont
Studdenham Please

STUDDENHAM Whats that mlady

LADY CHESHIRE Under her breath Youryourhands

 While STUDDENHAM is still staring at her FREDA is seen standing
 in the doorway like a black ghost

STUDDENHAM Come here You FREDA moves a few steps towards her
father When did you start this

FREDA Almost inaudibly In the summer father

LADY CHESHIRE Dont be harsh to her

STUDDENHAM Harsh His eyes again move from side to side as if
pain and anger had bewildered them Then looking sideways at FREDA
but in a gentler voice And when did you tell him aboutwhats come
to you

FREDA Last night

STUDDENHAM Oh With sudden menace You young He makes a
convulsive movement of one hand then in the silence seems to lose
grip of his thoughts and pits his hand up to his head I want to
clear me mind a bitI dont see it plain at all Without looking
at BILL Tis said theres been an offer of marriage

BILL Ive made it I stick to it

STUDDENHAM Oh With slow puzzled anger I want time to get the
pith o this You dont say anything Sir William

SIR WILLIAM The facts are all before you

STUDDENHAM Scarcely moving his lips Mlady

 LADY CHESHIRE is silent

STUDDENHAM Stammering My girl waswas good enough for any man
Its not for him thatsthats to look down on her To FREDA You
hear the handsome offer thats been made you Well FREDA moistens
her lips and tries to speak but cannot If nobodys to speak a
word we wont get much forrarder Id like for you to say whats in
your mind Sir William

SIR WILLIAM IIf my son marries her hell have to make his own
way

STUDDENHAM Savagely Im not puttin thought to that

SIR WILLIAM I didnt suppose you were Studdenham It appears to
rest with your daughter He suddenly takes out his handkerchief
and puts it to his forehead Infernal fires they make up here

LADY CHESHIRE who is again shivering desperately as if with intense
cold makes a violent attempt to control her shuddering

STUDDENHAM Suddenly Theres luxuries thats got to be paid for
To FREDA Speak up now

 FREDA turns slowly and looks up at SIR WILLIAM he involuntarily
 raises his hand to his mouth Her eyes travel on to LADY
 CHESHIRE who faces her but so deadly pale that she looks as if
 she were going to faint The girls gaze passes on to BILL
 standing rigid with his jaw set

FREDA I wantThen flinging her arm up over her eyes she turns
from him No

SIR WILLIAM Ah

 At that sound of profound relief STUDDENHAM whose eyes have
 been following his daughters moves towards SIR WILLIAM all
 his emotion turned into sheer angry pride

STUDDENHAM Dont be afraid Sir William We want none of you
Shell not force herself where shes not welcome She may ha
slipped her good name but shell keep her proper pride Ill have
no charity marriage in my family

SIR WILLIAM Steady Studdenham

STUDDENHAM If the young gentleman has tired of her in three months
as a blind man can see by the looks of himshes not for him

BILL Stepping forward Im ready to make it up to her

STUDDENHAM Keep back there He takes hold of FREDA and looks
around him Well Shes not the first this has happened to since
the world began an she wont be the last Come away now come away

Taking FREDA by the shoulders he guides her towards the door

SIR WILLIAM Dn it Studdenham Give us credit for something

STUDDENHAM Turning his face and eyes lighted up by a sort of
smiling snarl Ah I do that Sir William But theres things that
cant be undone

 He follows FREDA Out As the door closes SIR WILLIAMS Calm
 gives way He staggers past his wife and sinks heavily as
 though exhausted into a chair by the fire BILL following
 FREDA and STUDDENHAM has stopped at the shut door LADY
 CHESHIRE moves swiftly close to him The door of the
 billiardroom is opened and DOT appears With a glance round
 she crosses quickly to her mother

DOT In a low voice Mabels just going mother Almost
whispering Wheres Freda Is itHas she really had the pluck

 LADY CHESHIRE bending her head for Yes goes out into the
 billiardroom DOT clasps her hands together and standing
 there in the middle of the room looks from her brother to her
 father from her father to her brother A quaint little pitying
 smile comes on her lips She gives a faint shrug of her shoulders



The curtain falls
