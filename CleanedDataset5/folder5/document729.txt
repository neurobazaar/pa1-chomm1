PART ONE True Hackers
CAMBRIDGE The Fifties and Sixties

CHAPTER 1 THE TECH MODEL RAILROAD CLUB

Just why Peter Samson was wandering around in Building 26 in the
middle of the night is a matter that he would find difficult to
explain Some things are not spoken If you were like the
people whom Peter Samson was coming to know and befriend in this
his freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
the winter of 195859 no explanation would be required
Wandering around the labyrinth of laboratories and storerooms
searching for the secrets of telephone switching in machine
rooms tracing paths of wires or relays in subterranean steam
tunnels    for some it was common behavior and there was
no need to justify the impulse when confronted with a closed
door with an unbearably intriguing noise behind it to open the
door uninvited And then if there was no one to physically bar
access to whatever was making that intriguing noise to touch the
machine start flicking switches and noting responses and
eventually to loosen a screw unhook a template jiggle some
diodes and tweak a few connections Peter Samson and his friends
had grown up with a specific relationship to the world wherein
things had meaning only if you found out how they worked And
how would you go about that if not by getting your hands on them

It was in the basement of Building 26 that Samson and his friends
discovered the EAM room Building 26 was a long glassandsteel
structure one of MITs newer buildings contrasting with the
venerable pillared structures that fronted the Institute on
Massachusetts Avenue In the basement of this building void of
personality the EAM room Electronic Accounting Machinery A
room that housed machines which ran like computers

Not many people in 1959 had even seen a computer let alone
touched one Samson a wiry curlyhaired redhead with a way of
extending his vowels so that it would seem he was racing through
lists of possible meanings of statements in midword had viewed
computers on his visits to MIT from his hometown of Lowell
Massachusetts less than thirty miles from campus This made him
a Cambridge urchin one of dozens of sciencecrazy high
schoolers in the region who were drawn as if by gravitational
pull to the Cambridge campus He had even tried to rig up his
own computer with discarded parts of old pinball machines they
were the best source of logic elements he could find

LOGIC ELEMENTS the term seems to encapsulate what drew Peter
Samson son of a mill machinery repairman to electronics The
subject made sense When you grow up with an insatiable
curiosity as to how things work the delight you find upon
discovering something as elegant as circuit logic where all
connections have to complete their loops is profoundly
thrilling Peter Samson who early on appreciated the
mathematical simplicity of these things could recall seeing a
television show on Bostons public TV channel WGBH which gave a
rudimentary introduction to programming a computer in its own
language It fired his imagination to Peter Samson a computer
was surely like Aladdins lamprub it and it would do your
bidding So he tried to learn more about the field built
machines of his own entered science project competitions and
contests and went to the place that people of his ilk aspired
to MIT The repository of the very brightest of those weird
high school kids with owllike glasses and underdeveloped
pectorals who dazzled math teachers and flunked PE who dreamed
not of scoring on prom night but of getting to the finals of the
General Electric Science Fair competition MIT where he would
wander the hallways at two oclock in the morning looking for
something interesting and where he would indeed discover
something that would help draw him deeply into a new form of
creative process and a new lifestyle and would put him into
the forefront of a society envisioned only by a few
sciencefiction writers of mild disrepute He would discover a
computer that he could play with

The EAM room which Samson had chanced on was loaded with large
keypunch machines the size of squat file cabinets No one was
protecting them the room was staffed only by day when a select
group who had attained official clearance were privileged enough
to submit long manila cards to operators who would then use these
machines to punch holes in them according to what data the
privileged ones wanted entered on the cards A hole in the card
would represent some instruction to the computer telling it to
put a piece of data somewhere or perform a function on a piece
of data or move a piece of data from one place to another An
entire stack of these cards made one computer program a program
being a series of instructions which yield some expected result
just as the instructions in a recipe when precisely followed
lead to a cake Those cards would be taken to yet another
operator upstairs who would feed the cards into a reader that
would note where the holes were and dispatch this information to
the IBM 704 computer on the first floor of Building 26 The
Hulking Giant

The IBM 704 cost several million dollars took up an entire room
needed constant attention from a cadre of professional machine
operators and required special airconditioning so that the
glowing vacuum tubes inside it would not heat up to
datadestroying temperatures When the airconditioning broke
downa fairly common occurrencesa loud gong would sound and
three engineers would spring from a nearby office to frantically
take covers off the machine so its innards wouldnt melt All
these people in charge of punching cards feeding them into
readers and pressing buttons and switches on the machine were
what was commonly called a Priesthood and those privileged
enough to submit data to those most holy priests were the
official acolytes It was an almost ritualistic exchange

ACOLYTE Oh machine would you accept my offer of information so
you may run my program and perhaps give me a computation

PRIEST on behalf of the machine We will try We promise
nothing

As a general rule even these most privileged of acolytes were
not allowed direct access to the machine itself and they would
not be able to see for hours sometimes for days the results of
the machines ingestion of their batch of cards

This was something Samson knew and of course it frustrated the
hell out of Samson who wanted to get at the damn machine For
this was what life was all about

What Samson did not know and was delighted to discover was that
the EAM room also had a particular keypunch machine called the
407 Not only could it punch cards but it could also read
cards sort them and print them on listings No one seemed to
be guarding these machines which were computers sort of Of
course using them would be no picnic one needed to actually
wire up what was called a plug board a twoinchbytwoinch
plastic square with a mass of holes in it If you put hundreds
of wires through the holes in a certain order you would get
something that looked like a rats nest but would fit into this
electromechanical machine and alter its personality It could do
what you wanted it to do

So without any authorization whatsoever that is what Peter
Samson set out to do along with a few friends of his from an MIT
organization with a special interest in model railroading It
was a casual unthinking step into a sciencefiction future but
that was typical of the way that an odd subculture was pulling
itself up by its bootstraps and growing to underground
prominenceto become a culture that would be the impolite
unsanctioned soul of computerdom It was among the first
computer hacker escapades of the Tech Model Railroad Club or
TMRC

   

Peter Samson had been a member of the Tech Model Railroad Club
since his first week at MIT in the fall of 1958 The first event
that entering MIT freshmen attended was a traditional welcoming
lecture the same one that had been given for as long as anyone
at MIT could remember LOOK AT THE PERSON TO YOUR LEFT   
LOOK AT THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT    ONE OF YOU THREE WILL NOT
GRADUATE FROM THE INSTITUTE The intended effect of the speech
was to create that horrid feeling in the back of the collective
freshman throat that signaled unprecedented dread All their
lives these freshmen had been almost exempt from academic
pressure The exemption had been earned by virtue of brilliance
Now each of them had a person to the right and a person to the
left who was just as smart Maybe even smarter

But to certain students this was no challenge at all To these
youngsters classmates were perceived in a sort of friendly haze
maybe they would be of assistance in the consuming quest to find
out how things worked and then to master them There were
enough obstacles to learning alreadywhy bother with stupid
things like brownnosing teachers and striving for grades To
students like Peter Samson the quest meant more than the degree

Sometime after the lecture came Freshman Midway All the campus
organizationsspecialinterest groups fraternities and such
set up booths in a large gymnasium to try to recruit new members
The group that snagged Peter was the Tech Model Railroad Club
Its members brighteyed and crewcutted upperclassmen who spoke
with the spasmodic cadences of people who want words out of the
way in a hurry boasted a spectacular display of HO gauge trains
they had in a permanent clubroom in Building 20 Peter Samson
had long been fascinated by trains especially subways So he
went along on the walking tour to the building a shingleclad
temporary structure built during World War II The hallways were
cavernous and even though the clubroom was on the second floor
it had the dank dimly lit feel of a basement

The clubroom was dominated by the huge train layout It just
about filled the room and if you stood in the little control
area called the notch you could see a little town a little
industrial area a tiny working trolley line a papiermache
mountain and of course a lot of trains and tracks The trains
were meticulously crafted to resemble their fullscale
counterparts and they chugged along the twists and turns of
track with picturebook perfection

And then Peter Samson looked underneath the chesthigh boards
which held the layout It took his breath away Underneath this
layout was a more massive matrix of wires and relaysand crossbar
switches than Peter Samson had ever dreamed existed There were
neat regimental lines of switches and achingly regular rows of
dull bronze relays and a long rambling tangle of red blue and
yellow wirestwisting and twirling like a rainbowcolored
explosion of Einsteins hair It was an incredibly complicated
system and Peter Samson vowed to find out how it worked

The Tech Model Railroad Club awarded its members a key to the
clubroom after they logged forty hours of work on the layout
Freshman Midway had been on a Friday By Monday Peter Samson
had his key

   

There were two factions of TMRC Some members loved the idea of
spending their time building and painting replicas of certain
trains with historical and emotional value or creating realistic
scenery for the layout This was the knifeandpaintbrush
contingent and it subscribed to railroad magazines and booked
the club for trips on aging train lines The other faction
centered on the Signals and Power Subcommittee of the club and
it cared far more about what went on under the layout This was
The System which worked something like a collaboration between
Rube Goldberg and Wernher von Braun and it was constantly being
improved revamped perfected and sometimes gronkedin club
jargon screwed up SP people were obsessed with the way The
System worked its increasing complexities how any change you
made would affect other parts and how you could put those
relationships between the parts to optimal use

Many of the parts for The System had been donated by the Western
Electric College Gift Plan directly from the phone company The
clubs faculty advisor was also in charge of the campus phone
system and had seen to it that sophisticated phone equipment was
available for the model railroaders Using that equipment as a
starting point the Railroaders had devised a scheme which
enabled several people to control trains at once even if the
trains were at different parts of the same track Using dials
appropriated from telephones the TMRC engineers could specify
which block of track they wanted control of and run a train from
there This was done by using several types of phone company
relays including crossbar executors and step switches which let
you actually hear the power being transferred from one block to
another by an otherworldly chunkachunkachunka sound

It was the SP group who devised this fiendishly ingenious
scheme and it was the SP group who harbored the kind of
restless curiosity which led them to root around campus buildings
in search of ways to get their hands on computers They were
lifelong disciples of a HandsOn Imperative Head of SP was an
upperclassman named Bob Saunders with ruddy bulbous features
an infectious laugh and a talent for switch gear As a child in
Chicago he had built a highfrequency transformer for a high
school project it was his sixfoothigh version of a Tesla coil
something devised by an engineer in the 1800s which was supposed
to send out furious waves of electrical power Saunders said his
coil project managed to blow out television reception for blocks
around Another person who gravitated to SP was Alan Kotok a
plump chinless thickspectacled New Jerseyite in Samsons
class Kotoks family could recall him at age three prying a
plug out of a wall with a screwdriver and causing a hissing
shower of sparks to erupt When he was six he was building and
wiring lamps In high school he had once gone on a tour of the
Mobil Research Lab in nearby Haddonfield and saw his first
computerthe exhilaration of that experience helped him decide
to enter MIT In his freshman year he earned a reputation as
one of TMRCs most capable SP people

The SP people were the ones who spent Saturdays going to Eli
Heffrons junkyard in Somerville scrounging for parts who would
spend hours on their backs resting on little rolling chairs they
called bunkies to get underneath tight spots in the switching
system who would work through the night making the wholly
unauthorized connection between the TMRC phone and the East
Campus Technology was their playground

The core members hung out at the club for hours constantly
improving The System arguing about what could be done next
developing a jargon of their own that seemed incomprehensible to
outsiders who might chance on these teenaged fanatics with
their checked shortsleeve shirts pencils in their pockets
chino pants and always a bottle of CocaCola by their side
TMRC purchased its own Coke machine for the then forbidding sum
of 165 at a tariff of five cents a bottle the outlay was
replaced in three months to facilitate sales Saunders built a
change machine for Coke buyers that was still in use a decade
later When a piece of equipment wasnt working it was
losing when a piece of equipment was ruined it was munged
Mash Until No Good the two desks in the corner of the room
were not called the office but the orifice one who insisted
on studying for courses was a tool garbage was called cruft
and a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill
some constructive goal but with some wild pleasure taken in mere
involvement was called a hack

This latter term may have been suggested by ancient MIT lingo
the word hack had long been used to describe the elaborate
college pranks that MIT students would regularly devise such as
covering the dome that overlooked the campus with reflecting
foil But as the TMRC people used the word there was serious
respect implied While someone might call a clever connection
between relays a mere hack it would be understood that to
qualify as a hack the feat must be imbued with innovation
style and technical virtuosity Even though one might
selfdeprecatingly say he was hacking away at The System much
as an axewielder hacks at logs the artistry with which one
hacked was recognized to be considerable

The most productive people working on Signals and Power called
themselves hackers with great pride Within the confines of
the clubroom in Building 20 and of the Tool Room where some
study and many techno bull sessions took place they had
unilaterally endowed themselves with the heroic attributes of
Icelandic legend This is how Peter Samson saw himself and his
friends in a Sandburgesque poem in the club newsletter

Switch Thrower for the World
Fuze Tester Maker of Routes
Player with the Railroads and the Systems Advance Chopper
Grungy hairy sprawling
Machine of the PointFunction Lineolite
They tell me you are wicked and I believe them for I have seen
 your painted light bulbs under the lucite luring
 the system coolies   
Under the tower dust all over the place hacking with bifur
 cated springs   
Hacking even as an ignorant freshman acts who has never lost
 occupancy and has dropped out
Hacking the MBoards for under its locks are the switches and
 under its control the advance around the layout
 Hacking
Hacking the grungy hairy sprawling hacks of youth uncabled
 frying diodes proud to be Switchthrower Fuze
 tester Maker of Routes Player with Railroads
 and Advance Chopper to the System

Whenever they could Samson and the others would slip off to the
EAM room with their plug boards trying to use the machine to
keep track of the switches underneath the layout Just as
important they were seeing what the electromechanical counter
could do taking it to its limit

That spring of 1959 a new course was offered at MIT It was the
first course in programming a computer that freshmen could take
The teacher was a distant man with a wild shock of hair and an
equally unruly beardJohn McCarthy A master mathematician
McCarthy was a classically absentminded professor stories
abounded about his habit of suddenly answering a question hours
sometimes even days after it was first posed to him He would
approach you in the hallway and with no salutation would begin
speaking in his robotically precise diction as if the pause in
conversation had been only a fraction of a second and not a
week Most likely his belated response would be brilliant

McCarthy was one of a very few people working in an entirely new
form of scientific inquiry with computers The volatile and
controversial nature of his field of study was obvious from the
very arrogance of the name that McCarthy had bestowed upon it
Artificial Intelligence This man actually thought that
computers could be SMART Even at such a scienceintensive place
as MIT most people considered the thought ridiculous they
considered computers to be useful if somewhat absurdly
expensive tools for numbercrunching huge calculations and for
devising missile defense systems as MITs largest computer the
Whirlwind had done for the earlywarning SAGE system but
scoffed at the thought that computers themselves could actually
be a scientific field of study Computer Science did not
officially exist at MIT in the late fifties and McCarthy and his
fellow computer specialists worked in the Electrical Engineering
Department which offered the course No 641 that Kotok
Samson and a few other TRMC members took that spring

McCarthy had started a mammoth program on the IBM 704the
Hulking Giantthat would give it the extraordinary ability to
play chess To critics of the budding field of Artificial
Intelligence this was just one example of the boneheaded
optimism of people like John McCarthy But McCarthy had a
certain vision of what computers could do and playing chess was
only the beginning

All fascinating stuff but not the vision that was driving Kotok
and Samson and the others They wanted to learn how to WORK the
damn machines and while this new programming language called
LISP that McCarthy was talking about in 641 was interesting it
was not nearly as interesting as the act of programming or that
fantastic moment when you got your printout back from the
Priesthoodword from the source itselfand could then spend
hours poring over the results of the program what had gone wrong
with it how it could be improved The TMRC hackers were
devising ways to get into closer contact with the IBM 704 which
soon was upgraded to a newer model called the 709 By hanging
out at the computation center in the wee hours of the morning
and by getting to know the Priesthood and by bowing and scraping
the requisite number of times people like Kotok were eventually
allowed to push a few buttons on the machine and watch the
lights as it worked

There were secrets to those IBM machines that had been
painstakingly learned by some of the older people at MIT with
access to the 704 and friends among the Priesthood Amazingly a
few of these programmers grad students working with McCarthy
had even written a program that utilized one of the rows of tiny
lights the lights would be lit in such an order that it looked
like a little ball was being passed from right to left if an
operator hit a switch at just the right time the motion of the
lights could be reversedComputer PingPong This obviously was
the kind of thing that youd show off to impress your peers who
would then take a look at the actual program you had written and
see how it was done

To top the program someone else might try to do the same thing
with fewer instructionsa worthy endeavor since there was so
little room in the small memory of the computers of those days
that not many instructions could fit into them John McCarthy had
once noticed how his graduate students who loitered around the
704 would work over their computer programs to get the most out
of the fewest instructions and get the program compressed so
that fewer cards would need to be fed to the machine Shaving
off an instruction or two was almost an obsession with them
McCarthy compared these students to ski bums They got the same
kind of primal thrill from maximizing code as fanatic skiers
got from swooshing frantically down a hill So the practice of
taking a computer program and trying to cut off instructions
without affecting the outcome came to be called program
bumming and you would often hear people mumbling things like
Maybe I can bum a few instructions out and get the octal
correction card loader down to three cards instead of four

McCarthy in 1959 was turning his interest from chess to a new way
of talking to the computer the whole new language called LISP
Alan Kotok and his friends were more than eager to take over the
chess project Working on the batchprocessed IBM they embarked
on the gargantuan project of teaching the 704 and later the 709
and even after that its replacement the 7090 how to play the
game of kings Eventually Kotoks group became the largest users
of computer time in the entire MIT computation center

Still working with the IBM machine was frustrating There was
nothing worse than the long wait between the time you handed in
your cards and the time your results were handed back to you If
you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction the
program would crash and you would have to start the whole
process over again It went hand in hand with the stifling
proliferation of goddamn RULES that permeated the atmosphere of
the computation center Most of the rules were designed to keep
crazy young computer fans like Samson and Kotok and Saunders
physically distant from the machine itself The most rigid rule
of all was that no one should be able to actually touch or tamper
with the machine itself This of course was what those Signals
and Power people were dying to do more than anything else in the
world and the restrictions drove them mad

One priesta lowlevel subpriest reallyon the latenight
shift was particularly nasty in enforcing this rule so Samson
devised a suitable revenge While poking around at Elis
electronic junk shop one day he chanced upon an electrical board
precisely like the kind of board holding the clunky vacuum tubes
which resided inside the IBM One night sometime before 4 AM
this particular subpriest stepped out for a minute when he
returned Samson told him that the machine wasnt working but
theyd found the troubleand held up the totally smashed module
from the old 704 hed gotten at Elis

The subpriest could hardly get the words out Wwhere did you
get that

Samson who had wide green eyes that could easily look maniacal
slowly pointed to an open place on the machine rack where of
course no board had ever been but the space still looked sadly
bare The subpriest gasped He made faces that indicated his
bowels were about to give out He whimpered exhortations to the
deity Visions no doubt of a milliondollar deduction from his
paycheck began flashing before him Only after his supervisor a
high priest with some understanding of the mentality of these
young wiseguys from the Model Railroad Club came and explained
the situation did he calm down

He was not the last administrator to feel the wrath of a hacker
thwarted in the quest for access

   

One day a former TMRC member who was now on the MIT faculty paid
a visit to the clubroom His name was Jack Dennis When he had
been an undergraduate in the early 1950s he had worked furiously
underneath the layout Dennis lately had been working a computer
which MIT had just received from Lincoln Lab a military
development laboratory affiliated with the Institute The
computer was called the TX0 and it was one of the first
transistorrun computers in the world Lincoln Lab had used it
specifically to test a giant computer called the TX2 which had
a memory so complex that only with this specially built little
brother could its ills be capably diagnosed Now that its
original job was over the threemilliondollar TX0 had been
shipped over to the Institute on longterm loan and apparently
no one at Lincoln Lab had marked a calendar with a return date
Dennis asked the SP people at TMRC whether they would like to

Hey you nuns Would you like to meet the Pope

The TX0 was in Building 26 in the secondfloor Radio Laboratory
of Electronics RLE directly above the firstfloor Computation
Center which housed the hulking IBM 704 The RLE lab resembled
the control room of an antique spaceship The TX0 or Tixo as
it was sometimes called was for its time a midget machine since
it was one of the first computers to use fingersize transistors
instead of handsize vacuum tubes Still it took up much of the
room along with its fifteen tons of supporting airconditioning
equipment The TXOs workings were mounted on several tall
thin chassis like rugged metal bookshelves with tangled wires
and neat little rows of tiny bottlelike containers in which the
transistors were inserted Another rack had a solid metal front
speckled with grimlooking gauges Facing the racks was an
Lshaped console the control panel of this H G Wells
spaceship with a blue countertop for your elbows and papers On
the short arm of the L stood a Flexowriter which resembled a
typewriter converted for tank warfare its bottom anchored in a
military gray housing Above the top were the control panels
boxlike protrusions painted an institutional yellow On the
sides of the boxes which faced the user were a few gauges
several lines of quarterinch blinking lights a matrix of steel
toggle switches the size of large grains of rice and best of
all an actual cathode ray tube display round and smokegray

The TMRC people were awed THIS MACHINE DID NOT USE CARDS The
user would first punch in a program onto a long thin paper tape
with a Flexowriter there were a few extra Flexowriters in an
adjoining room then sit at the console feed in the program by
running the tape through a reader and be able to sit there while
the program ran If something went wrong with the program you
knew immediately and you could diagnose the problem by using
some of the switches or checking out which of the lights were
blinking or lit The computer even had an audio output while
the program ran a speaker underneath the console would make a
sort of music like a poorly tuned electric organ whose notes
would vibrate with a fuzzy ethereal din The chords on this
organ would change depending on what data the machine was
reading at any given microsecond after you were familiar with
the tones you could actually HEAR what part of your program the
computer was working on You would have to discern this though
over the clacking of the Flexowriter which could make you think
you were in the middle of a machinegun battle Even more
amazing was that because of these interactive capabilities
and also because users seemed to be allowed blocks of time to use
the TX0 all by themselves you could even modify a program WHILE
SITTING AT THE COMPUTER A miracle

There was no way in hell that Kotok Saunders Samson and the
others were going to be kept away from that machine
Fortunately there didnt seem to be the kind of bureaucracy
surrounding the TX0 that there was around the IBM 704 No cadre
of officious priests The technician in charge was a canny
whitehaired Scotsman named John McKenzie While he made sure
that graduate students and those working on funded projects
Officially Sanctioned Usersmaintained access to the machine
McKenzie tolerated the crew of TMRC madmen who began to hang out
in the RLE lab where the TX0 stood

Samson Kotok Saunders and a freshman named Bob Wagner soon
figured out that the best time of all to hang out in Building 26
was at night when no person in his right mind would have signed
up for an hourlong session on the piece of paper posted every
Friday beside the air conditioner in the RLE lab The TX0 as a
rule was kept running twentyfour hours a daycomputers back
then were too expensive for their time to be wasted by leaving
them idle through the night and besides it was a hairy
procedure to get the thing up and running once it was turned off
So the TMRC hackers who soon were referring to themselves as
TX0 hackers changed their lifestyle to accommodate the
computer They laid claim to what blocks of time they could and
would vulture time with nocturnal visits to the lab on the off
chance that someone who was scheduled for a 3 AM session might
not show up

Oh Samson would say delightedly a minute or so after someone
failed to show up at the time designated in the logbook Make
sure it doesnt go to waste

It never seemed to because the hackers were there almost all the
time If they werent in the RLE lab waiting for an opening to
occur they were in the classroom next to the TMRC clubroom the
Tool Room playing a hangmanstyle word game that Samson had
devised called Come Next Door waiting for a call from someone
who was near the TX0 monitoring it to see if someone had not
shown up for a session The hackers recruited a network of
informers to give advance notice of potential openings at the
computerif a research project was not ready with its program in
time or a professor was sick the word would be passed to TMRC
and the hackers would appear at the TX0 breathless and ready to
jam into the space behind the console

Though Jack Dennis was theoretically in charge of the operation
Dennis was teaching courses at the time and preferred to spend
the rest of his time actually writing code for the machine
Dennis played the role of benevolent godfather to the hackers
he would give them a brief handson introduction to the machine
point them in certain directions be amused at their wild
programming ventures He had little taste for administration
though and was just as happy to let John McKenzie run things
McKenzie early on recognized that the interactive nature of the
TX0 was inspiring a new form of computer programming and the
hackers were its pioneers So he did not lay down too many
edicts

The atmosphere was loose enough in 1959 to accommodate the
strayssciencemad people whose curiosity burned like a hunger
who like Peter Samson would be exploring the uncharted maze of
laboratories at MIT The noise of the airconditioning the
audio output and the drillhammer Flexowriter would lure these
wanderers whod poke their heads into the lab like kittens
peering into baskets of yarn

One of those wanderers was an outsider named Peter Deutsch Even
before discovering the TX0 Deutsch had developed a fascination
for computers It began one day when he picked up a manual that
someone had discarded a manual for an obscure form of computer
language for doing calculations Something about the orderliness
of the computer instructions appealed to him he would later
describe the feeling as the same kind of eerily transcendent
recognition that an artist experiences when he discovers the
medium that is absolutely right for him THIS IS WHERE I BELONG
Deutsch tried writing a small program and signing up for time
under the name of one of the priests ran it on a computer
Within weeks he had attained a striking proficiency in
programming He was only twelve years old

He was a shy kid strong in math and unsure of most everything
else He was uncomfortably overweight deficient in sports but
an intellectual star performer His father was a professor at
MIT and Peter used that as his entree to explore the labs

It was inevitable that he would be drawn to the TX0 He first
wandered into the small Kluge Room a kluge is a piece of
inelegantly constructed equipment that seems to defy logic by
working properly where three offline Flexowriters were
available for punching programs onto paper tape which would later
be fed into the TX0 Someone was busy punching in a tape
Peter watched for a while then began bombarding the poor soul
with questions about that weirdlooking little computer in the
next room Then Peter went up to the TX0 itself examined it
closely noting how it differed from other computers it was
smaller had a CRT display and other neat toys He decided
right then to act as if he had a perfect right to be there He
got hold of a manual and soon was startling people by spouting
actual makesense computer talk and eventually was allowed to
sign up for night and weekend sessions and to write his own
programs

McKenzie worried that someone might accuse him of running some
sort of summer camp with this shortpants little kid barely
tall enough to stick his head over the TXOs console staring at
the code that an Officially Sanctioned User perhaps some
selfimportant graduate student would be hammering into the
Flexowriter and saying in his squeaky preadolescent voice
something like Your problem is that this credit is wrong over
here    you need this other instruction over there and the
selfimportant grad student would go crazyWHO IS THIS LITTLE
WORMand start screaming at him to go out and play somewhere
Invariably though Peter Deutschs comments would turn out to be
correct Deutsch would also brazenly announce that he was going
to write better programs than the ones currently available and
he would go and do it

Samson Kotok and the other hackers accepted Peter Deutsch by
virtue of his computer knowledge he was worthy of equal
treatment Deutsch was not such a favorite with the Officially
Sanctioned Users especially when he sat behind them ready to
spring into action when they made a mistake on the Flexowriter
These Officially Sanctioned Users appeared at the TX0 with the
regularity of commuters The programs they ran were statistical
analyses cross correlations simulations of an interior of the
nucleus of a cell Applications That was fine for Users but
it was sort of a waste in the minds of the hackers What hackers
had in mind was getting behind the console of the TX0 much in
the same way as getting in behind the throttle of a plane Or as
Peter Samson a classical music fan put it computing with the
TX0 was like playing a musical instrument an absurdly
expensive musical instrument upon which you could improvise
compose and like the beatniks in Harvard Square a mile away
wail like a banshee with total creative abandon

One thing that enabled them to do this was the programming system
devised by Jack Dennis and another professor Tom Stockman When
the TX0 arrived at MIT it had been stripped down since its days
at Lincoln Lab the memory had been reduced considerably to
4096 words of eighteen bits each A bit is a BInary digiT
either a one or zero These binary numbers are the only thing
computers understand A series of binary numbers is called a
word And the TX0 had almost no software So Jack Dennis
even before he introduced the TMRC people to the TX0 had been
writing systems programsthe software to help users utilize
the machine

The first thing Dennis worked on was an assembler This was
something that translated assembly languagewhich used three
letter symbolic abbreviations that represented instructions to
the machineinto machine language which consisted of the binary
numbers 0 and 1 The TX0 had a rather limited assembly
language since its design allowed only two bits of each
eighteenbit word to be used for instructions to the computer
only four instructions could be used each possible twobit
variation00 0 1 10 and 11represented an instruction
Everything the computer did could be broken down to the execution
of one of those four instructions it took one instruction to
add two numbers but a series of perhaps twenty instructions to
multiply two numbers Staring at a long list of computer
commands written as binary numbersfor example 10011001100001
could make you into a babbling mental case in a matter of
minutes But the same command in assembly language might look
like this ADD Y After loading the computer with the assembler
that Dennis wrote you could write programs in this simpler
symbolic form and wait smugly while the computer did the
translation into binary for you Then youd feed that binary
object code back into the computer The value of this was
incalculable it enabled programmers to write in something that
LOOKED like code rather than an endless dizzying series of ones
and zeros

The other program that Dennis worked on with Stockman was
something even newera debugger The TX0 came with a debugging
program called UT3 which enabled you to talk to the computer
while it was running by typing commands directly into the
Flexowriter But it had terrible problemsfor one thing it only
accepted typedin code that used the octal numeric system
Octal is a baseeight number system as opposed to binary
which is base two and Arabicourswhich is base ten and it is
a difficult system to use So Dennis and Stockman decided to
write something better than UT3 which would enable users to use
the symbolic easiertoworkwith assembly language This came
to be called FLIT and it allowed users to actually find program
bugs during a session fix them and keep the program running
Dennis would explain that FLIT stood for FLexowriter
Interrogation Tape but clearly the names real origin was the
insect spray with that brand name FLIT was a quantum leap
forward since it liberated programmers to actually do original
composing on the machinejust like musicians composing on their
musical instruments With the use of the debugger which took up
one third of the 4096 words of the TXOs memory hackers were
free to create a new more daring style of programming

And what did these hacker programs DO Well sometimes it
didnt matter much at all what they did Peter Samson hacked the
night away on a program that would instantly convert Arabic
numbers to Roman numerals and Jack Dennis after admiring the
skill with which Samson had accomplished this feat said My
God why would anyone want to do such a thing But Dennis knew
why There was ample justification in the feeling of power and
accomplishment Samson got when he fed in the paper tape
monitored the lights and switches and saw what were once plain
old blackboard Arabic numbers coming back as the numerals the
Romans had hacked with

In fact it was Jack Dennis who suggested to Samson that there
were considerable uses for the TXOs ability to send noise to
the audio speaker While there were no builtin controls for
pitch amplitude or tone character there was a way to control
the speakersounds would be emitted depending on the state of
the fourteenth bit in the eighteenbit words the TX0 had in its
accumulator in a given microsecond The sound was on or off
depending on whether bit fourteen was a one or zero So Samson
set about writing programs that varied the binary numbers in that
slot in different ways to produce different pitches

At that time only a few people in the country had been
experimenting with using a computer to output any kind of music
and the methods they had been using required massive computations
before the machine would so much as utter a note Samson who
reacted with impatience to those who warned he was attempting the
impossible wanted a computer playing music right away So he
learned to control that one bit in the accumulator so adeptly
that he could command it with the authority of Charlie Parker on
the saxophone In a later version of this music compiler Samson
rigged it so that if you made an error in your programming
syntax the Flexowriter would switch to a red ribbon and print
To err is human to forgive divine

When outsiders heard the melodies of Johann Sebastian Bach in a
singlevoice monophonic square wave no harmony they were
universally unfazed Big deal Three million dollars for this
giant hunk of machinery and why shouldnt it do at least as much
as a fivedollar toy piano It was no use to explain to these
outsiders that Peter Samson had virtually bypassed the process by
which music had been made for eons Music had always been made
by directly creating vibrations that were sound What happened
in Samsons program was that a load of numbers bits of
information fed into a computer comprised a code in which the
music resided You could spend hours staring at the code and
not be able to divine where the music was It only became music
while millions of blindingly brief exchanges of data were taking
place in the accumulator sitting in one of the metal wire and
silicon racks that comprised the TX0 Samson had asked the
computer which had no apparent knowledge of how to use a voice
to lift itself in songand the TX0 had complied

So it was that a computer program was not only metaphorically a
musical compositionit was LITERALLY a musical composition It
looked likeand wasthe same kind of program which yielded
complex arithmetical computations and statistical analyses
These digits that Samson had jammed into the computer were a
universal language which could produce ANYTHINGa Bach fugue or
an antiaircraft system

Samson did not say any of this to the outsiders who were
unimpressed by his feat Nor did the hackers themselves discuss
thisit is not even clear that they analyzed the phenomenon in
such cosmic terms Peter Samson did it and his colleagues
appreciated it because it was obviously a neat hack That was
justification enough

   

To hackers like Bob Saundersbalding plump and merry disciple
of the TX0 president of TMRCs SP group student of systems
it was a perfect existence Saunders had grown up in the suburbs
of Chicago and for as long as he could remember the workings of
electricity and telephone circuitry had fascinated him Before
beginning MIT Saunders had landed a dream summer job working
for the phone company installing central office equipment He
would spend eight blissful hours with soldering iron and pliers
in hand working in the bowels of various systems an idyll
broken by lunch hours spent in deep study of phone company
manuals It was the phone company equipment underneath the TMRC
layout that had convinced Saunders to become active in the Model
Railroad Club

Saunders being an upperclassman had come to the TX0 later in
his college career than Kotok and Samson he had used the
breathing space to actually lay the foundation for a social life
which included courtship of and eventual marriage to Marge
French who had done some nonhacking computer work for a
research project Still the TX0 was the center of his college
career and he shared the common hacker experience of seeing his
grades suffer from missed classes It didnt bother him much
because he knew that his real education was occurring in Room 240
of Building 26 behind the Tixo console Years later he would
describe himself and the others as an elite group Other people
were off studying spending their days up on fourfloor buildings
making obnoxious vapors or off in the physics lab throwing
particles at things or whatever it is they do And we were
simply not paying attention to what other folks were doing
because we had no interest in it They were studying what they
were studying and we were studying what we were studying And
the fact that much of it was not on the officially approved
curriculum was by and large immaterial

The hackers came out at night It was the only way to take full
advantage of the crucial offhours of the TX0 During the
day Saunders would usually manage to make an appearance in a
class or two Then some time spent performing basic
maintenancethings like eating and going to the bathroom He
might see Marge for a while But eventually he would filter over
to Building 26 He would go over some of the programs of the
night before printed on the nineandahalfinchwide paper that
the Flexowriter used He would annotate and modify the listing
to update the code to whatever he considered the next stage of
operation Maybe then he would move over to the Model Railroad
Club and hed swap his program with someone checking
simultaneously for good ideas and potential bugs Then back to
Building 26 to the Kluge Room next to the TX0 to find an
offline Flexowriter on which to update his code All the while
hed be checking to see if someone had canceled a onehour
session on the machine his own session was scheduled at
something like two or three in the morning Hed wait in the
Kluge Room or play some bridge back at the Railroad Club until
the time came

Sitting at the console facing the metal racks that held the
computers transistors each transistor representing a location
that either held or did not hold a bit of memory Saunders would
set up the Flexowriter which would greet him with the word
WALRUS This was something Samson had hacked in honor of
Lewis Carrolls poem with the line The time has come the Walrus
said    Saunders might chuckle at that as he went into the
drawer for the paper tape which held the assembler program and
fed that into the tape reader Now the computer would be ready
to assemble his program so hed take the Flexowriter tape hed
been working on and send that into the computer Hed watch the
lights go on as the computer switched his code from source the
symbolic assembly language to object code binary which the
computer would punch out into another paper tape Since that
tape was in the object code that the TX0 understood hed feed
it in hoping that the program would run magnificently

There would most probably be a few fellow hackers kibitzing
behind him laughing and joking and drinking Cokes and eating
some junk food theyd extracted from the machine downstairs
Saunders preferred the lemon jelly wedges that the others called
lemon gunkies But at four in the morning anything tasted
good They would all watch as the program began to run the
lights going on the whine from the speaker humming in high or
low register depending on what was in Bit 14 in the accumulator
and the first thing hed see on the CRT display after the program
had been assembled and run was that the program had crashed So
hed reach into the drawer for the tape with the FLIT debugger
and feed THAT into the computer The computer would then be a
debugging machine and hed send the program back in Now he
could start trying to find out where things had gone wrong and
maybe if he was lucky hed find out and change things by putting
in some commands by flicking some of the switches on the console
in precise order or hammering in some code on the Flexowriter
Once things got runningand it was always incredibly satisfying
when something worked when hed made that roomful of transistors
and wires and metal and electricity all meld together to create a
precise output that hed devisedhed try to add the next
advance to it When the hour was oversomeone already itching
to get on the machine after himSaunders would be ready to spend
the next few hours figuring out what the heck had made the
program go bellyup

The peak hour itself was tremendously intense but during the
hours before and even during the hours afterward a hacker
attained a state of pure concentration When you programmed a
computer you had to be aware of where all the thousands of bits
of information were going from one instruction to the next and
be able to predictand exploitthe effect of all that movement
When you had all that information glued to your cerebral being
it was almost as if your own mind had merged into the environment
of the computer Sometimes it took hours to build up to the
point where your thoughts could contain that total picture and
when you did get to that point it was such a shame to waste it
that you tried to sustain it by marathon bursts alternatively
working on the computer or poring over the code that you wrote on
one of the offline Flexowriters in the Kluge Room You would
sustain that concentration by wrapping around to the next day

Inevitably that frame of mind spilled over to what random shards
of existence the hackers had outside of computing The
knifeandpaintbrush contingent at TMRC were not pleased at all
by the infiltration of Tixomania into the club they saw it as
a sort of Trojan horse for a switch in the club focus from
railroading to computing And if you attended one of the club
meetings held every Tuesday at fivefifteen you could see the
concern the hackers would exploit every possible thread of
parliamentary procedure to create a meeting as convoluted as the
programs they were hacking on the TX0 Motions were made to
make motions to make motions and objections ruled out of order
as if they were so many computer errors A note in the minutes
of the meeting on November 24 1959 suggests that we frown on
certain members who would do the club a lot more good by doing
more SPing and less reading Roberts Rules of Order Samson
was one of the worst offenders and at one point an exasperated
TMRC member made a motion to purchase a cork for Samsons oral
diarrhea

Hacking parliamentary procedure was one thing but the logical
mindframe required for programming spilled over into more
commonplace activities You could ask a hacker a question and
sense his mental accumulator processing bits until he came up
with a precise answer to the question you asked Marge Saunders
would drive to the Safeway every Saturday morning in the
Volkswagen and upon her return ask her husband Would you like
to help me bring in the groceries Bob Saunders would reply
No Stunned Marge would drag in the groceries herself After
the same thing occurred a few times she exploded hurling curses
at him and demanding to know why he said no to her question

Thats a stupid question to ask he said Of course I wont
LIKE to help you bring in the groceries If you ask me if Ill
help you bring them in thats another matter

It was as if Marge had submitted a program into the TX0 and the
program as programs do when the syntax is improper had crashed
It was not until she debugged her question that Bob Saunders
would allow it to run successfully on his own mental computer


CHAPTER 2
THE HACKER ETHIC

Something new was coalescing around the TX0 a new way of life
with a philosophy an ethic and a dream

There was no one moment when it started to dawn on the TX0
hackers that by devoting their technical abilities to computing
with a devotion rarely seen outside of monasteries they were the
vanguard of a daring symbiosis between man and machine With a
fervor like that of young hotrodders fixated on souping up
engines they came to take their almost unique surroundings for
granted Even as the elements of a culture were forming as
legends began to accrue as their mastery of programming started
to surpass any previous recorded levels of skill the dozen or so
hackers were reluctant to acknowledge that their tiny society on
intimate terms with the TX0 had been slowly and implicitly
piecing together a body of concepts beliefs and mores

The precepts of this revolutionary Hacker Ethic were not so much
debated and discussed as silently agreed upon No manifestos
were issued No missionaries tried to gather converts The
computer did the converting and those who seemed to follow the
Hacker Ethic most faithfully were people like Samson Saunders
and Kotok whose lives before MIT seemed to be mere preludes to
that moment when they fulfilled themselves behind the console of
the TX0 Later there would come hackers who took the implicit
Ethic even more seriously than the TX0 hackers did hackers like
the legendary Greenblatt or Gosper though it would be some years
yet before the tenets of hackerism would be explicitly
delineated

Still even in the days of the TX0 the planks of the platform
were in place The Hacker Ethic

ACCESS TO COMPUTERSAND ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT TEACH YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKSSHOULD BE UNLIMITED AND TOTAL
ALWAYS YIELD TO THE HANDSON IMPERATIVE

Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the
systemsabout the worldfrom taking things apart seeing how
they work and using this knowledge to create new and even more
interesting things They resent any person physical barrier or
law that tries to keep them from doing this

This is especially true when a hacker wants to fix something that
from his point of view is broken or needs improvement
Imperfect systems infuriate hackers whose primal instinct is to
debug them This is one reason why hackers generally hate
driving carsthe system of randomly programmed red lights and
oddly laid out oneway streets causes delays which are so
goddamned UNNECESSARY that the impulse is to rearrange signs
open up trafficlight control boxes   redesign the entire
system

In a perfect hacker world anyone pissed off enough to open up a
control box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it
work better should be perfectly welcome to make the attempt
Rules which prevent you from taking matters like that into your
own hands are too ridiculous to even consider abiding by This
attitude helped the Model Railroad Club start on an extremely
informal basis something called the Midnight Requisitioning
Committee When TMRC needed a set of diodes or some extra
relays to build some new feature into The System a few SP
people would wait until dark and find their way into the places
where those things were kept None of the hackers who were as a
rule scrupulously honest in other matters seemed to equate this
with stealing A willful blindness

ALL INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE

If you dont have access to the information you need to improve
things how can you fix them A free exchange of information
particularly when the information was in the form of a computer
program allowed for greater overall creativity When you were
working on a machine like the TX0 which came with almost no
software everyone would furiously write systems programs to make
programming easierTools to Make Tools kept in the drawer by
the console for easy access by anyone using the machine This
prevented the dread timewasting ritual of reinventing the
wheel instead of everybody writing his own version of the same
program the best version would be available to everyone and
everyone would be free to delve into the code and improve on
THAT A world studded with featurefull programs bummed to the
minimum debugged to perfection

The belief sometimes taken unconditionally that information
should be free was a direct tribute to the way a splendid
computer or computer program worksthe binary bits moving in
the most straightforward logical path necessary to do their
complex job What was a computer but something which benefited
from a free flow of information If say the accumulator found
itself unable to get information from the inputoutput io
devices like the tape reader or the switches the whole system
would collapse In the hacker viewpoint any system could
benefit from that easy flow of information

MISTRUST AUTHORITYPROMOTE DECENTRALIZATION

The best way to promote this free exchange of information is to
have an open system something which presents no boundaries
between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of
equipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge improvement
and time online The last thing you need is a bureaucracy
Bureaucracies whether corporate government or university are
flawed systems dangerous in that they cannot accommodate the
exploratory impulse of true hackers Bureaucrats hide behind
arbitrary rules as opposed to the logical algorithms by which
machines and computer programs operate they invoke those rules
to consolidate power and perceive the constructive impulse of
hackers as a threat

The epitome of the bureaucratic world was to be found at a very
large company called International Business MachinesIBM The
reason its computers were batchprocessed Hulking Giants was only
partially because of vacuum tube technology The real reason was
that IBM was a clumsy hulking company which did not understand
the hacking impulse If IBM had its way so the TMRC hackers
thought the world would be batchprocessed laid out on those
annoying little punch cards and only the most privileged of
priests would be permitted to actually interact with the
computer

All you had to do was look at someone in the IBM world and note
the buttondown white shirt the neatly pinned black tie the
hair carefully held in place and the tray of punch cards in
hand You could wander into the Computation Center where the
704 the 709 and later the 7090 were storedthe best IBM had to
offerand see the stifling orderliness down to the ropedoff
areas beyond which nonauthorized people could not venture And
you could compare that to the extremely informal atmosphere
around the TX0 where grungy clothes were the norm and almost
anyone could wander in

Now IBM had done and would continue to do many things to advance
computing By its sheer size and mighty influence it had made
computers a permanent part of life in America To many people
the words IBM and computer were virtually synonymous IBMs
machines were reliable workhorses worthy of the trust that
businessmen and scientists invested in them This was due in
part to IBMs conservative approach it would not make the most
technologically advanced machines but would rely on proven
concepts and careful aggressive marketing As IBMs dominance
of the computer field was established the company became an
empire unto itself secretive and smug

What really drove the hackers crazy was the attitude of the IBM
priests and subpriests who seemed to think that IBM had the
only real computers and the rest were all trash You couldnt
talk to those peoplethey were beyond convincing They were
batchprocessed people and it showed not only in their
preference of machines but in their idea about the way a
computation center and a world should be run Those people
could never understand the obvious superiority of a decentralized
system with no one giving orders a system where people could
follow their interests and if along the way they discovered a
flaw in the system they could embark on ambitious surgery No
need to get a requisition form just a need to get something
done

This antibureaucratic bent coincided neatly with the
personalities of many of the hackers who since childhood had
grown accustomed to building science projects while the rest of
their classmates were banging their heads together and learning
social skills on the field of sport These young adults who were
once outcasts found the computer a fantastic equalizer
experiencing a feeling according to Peter Samson like you
opened the door and walked through this grand new universe   
Once they passed through that door and sat behind the console of
a milliondollar computer hackers had power So it was natural
to distrust any force which might try to limit the extent of that
power

HACKERS SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THEIR HACKING NOT BOGUS CRITERIA
SUCH AS DEGREES AGE RACE OR POSITION

The ready acceptance of twelveyearold Peter Deutsch in the TX0
community though not by nonhacker graduate students was a good
example Likewise people who trotted in with seemingly
impressive credentials were not taken seriously until they proved
themselves at the console of a computer This meritocratic trait
was not necessarily rooted in the inherent goodness of hacker
heartsit was mainly that hackers cared less about someones
superficial characteristics than they did about his potential to
advance the general state of hacking to create new programs to
admire to talk about that new feature in the system

YOU CAN CREATE ART AND BEAUTY ON A COMPUTER

Samsons music program was an example But to hackers the art
of the program did not reside in the pleasing sounds emanating
from the online speaker The code of the program held a beauty
of its own Samson though was particularly obscure in
refusing to add comments to his source code explaining what he
was doing at a given time One welldistributed program Samson
wrote went on for hundreds of assembly language instructions
with only one comment beside an instruction which contained the
number 1750 The comment was RIPJSB and people racked their
brains about its meaning until someone figured out that 1750 was
the year Bach died and that Samson had written an abbreviation
for Rest In Peace Johann Sebastian Bach

A certain esthetic of programming style had emerged Because of
the limited memory space of the TX0 a handicap that extended to
all computers of that era hackers came to deeply appreciate
innovative techniques which allowed programs to do complicated
tasks with very few instructions The shorter a program was the
more space you had left for other programs and the faster a
program ran Sometimes when you didnt need speed or space much
and you werent thinking about art and beauty youd hack
together an ugly program attacking the problem with brute
force methods Well we can do this by adding twenty numbers
Samson might say to himself and its quicker to write
instructions to do that than to think out a loop in the beginning
and the end to do the same job in seven or eight instructions
But the latter program might be admired by fellow hackers and
some programs were bummed to the fewest lines so artfully that
the authors peers would look at it and almost melt with awe

Sometimes program bumming became competitive a macho contest to
prove oneself so much in command of the system that one could
recognize elegant shortcuts to shave off an instruction or two
or better yet rethink the whole problem and devise a new
algorithm which would save a whole block of instructions An
algorithm is a specific procedure which one can apply to solve a
complex computer problem it is sort of a mathematical skeleton
key This could most emphatically be done by approaching the
problem from an offbeat angle that no one had ever thought of
before but that in retrospect made total sense There was
definitely an artistic impulse residing in those who could
utilize this geniusfromMars techniques blackmagic visionary
quality which enabled them to discard the stale outlook of the
best minds on earth and come up with a totally unexpected new
algorithm

This happened with the decimal print routine program This was a
subroutines program within a program that you could sometimes
integrate into many different programsto translate binary
numbers that the computer gave you into regular decimal numbers
In Saunders words this problem became the pawns ass of
programmingif you could write a decimal print routine which
worked you knew enough about the computer to call yourself a
programmer of sorts And if you wrote a GREAT decimal print
routine you might be able to call yourself a hacker More than
a competition the ultimate bumming of the decimal print routine
became a sort of hacker Holy Grail

Various versions of decimal print routines had been around for
some months If you were being deliberately stupid about it or
if you were a genuine moronan outandout loserit might
take you a hundred instructions to get the computer to convert
machine language to decimal But any hacker worth his salt could
do it in less and finally by taking the best of the programs
bumming an instruction here and there the routine was diminished
to about fifty instructions

After that things got serious People would work for hours
seeking a way to do the same thing in fewer lines of code It
became more than a competition it was a quest For all the
effort expended no one seemed to be able to crack the fiftyline
barrier The question arose whether it was even possible to do
it in less Was there a point beyond which a program could not
be bummed

Among the people puzzling with this dilemma was a fellow named
Jenson a tall silent hacker from Maine who would sit quietly in
the Kluge Room and scribble on printouts with the calm demeanor
of a backwoodsman whittling Jenson was always looking for ways
to compress his programs in time and spacehis code was a
completely bizarre sequence of intermingled Boolean and
arithmetic functions often causing several different
computations to occur in different sections of the same
eighteenbit word Amazing things magical stunts

Before Jenson there had been general agreement that the only
logical algorithm for a decimal print routine would have the
machine repeatedly subtracting using a table of the powers of
ten to keep the numbers in proper digital columns Jenson
somehow figured that a powersoften table wasnt necessary he
came up with an algorithm that was able to convert the digits in
a reverse order but by some digital sleight of hand print them
out in the proper order There was a complex mathematical
justification to it that was clear to the other hackers only when
they saw Jensons program posted on a bulletin board his way of
telling them that he had taken the decimal print routine to its
limit FORTYSIX INSTRUCTIONS People would stare at the code
and their jaws would drop Marge Saunders remembers the hackers
being unusually quiet for days afterward

We knew that was the end of it Bob Saunders later said That
was Nirvana

COMPUTERS CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER

This belief was subtly manifest Rarely would a hacker try to
impose a view of the myriad advantages of the computer way of
knowledge to an outsider Yet this premise dominated the
everyday behavior of the TX0 hackers as well as the generations
of hackers that came after them

Surely the computer had changed THEIR lives enriched their
lives given their lives focus made their lives adventurous It
had made them masters of a certain slice of fate Peter Samson
later said We did it twentyfive to thirty percent for the sake
of doing it because it was something we could do and do well and
sixty percent for the sake of having something which was in its
metaphorical way alive our offspring which would do things on
its own when we were finished Thats the great thing about
programming the magical appeal it has    Once you fix a
behavioral problem a computer or program has its fixed
forever and it is exactly an image of what you meant

LIKE ALADDINS LAMP YOU COULD GET IT TO DO YOUR BIDDING

Surely everyone could benefit from experiencing this power
Surely everyone could benefit from a world based on the Hacker
Ethic This was the implicit belief of the hackers and the
hackers irreverently extended the conventional point of view of
what computers could and should doleading the world to a new
way of looking and interacting with computers

This was not easily done Even at such an advanced institution
as MIT some professors considered a manic affinity for computers
as frivolous even demented TMRC hacker Bob Wagner once had to
explain to an engineering professor what a computer was Wagner
experienced this clash of computer versus anticomputer even more
vividly when he took a Numerical Analysis class in which the
professor required each student to do homework using rattling
clunky electromechanical calculators Kotok was in the same
class and both of them were appalled at the prospect of working
with those lotech machines Why should we they asked when
weve got this computer

So Wagner began working on a computer program that would emulate
the behavior of a calculator The idea was outrageous To some
it was a misappropriation of valuable machine time According to
the standard thinking on computers their time was too precious
that one should only attempt things which took maximum advantage
of the computer things that otherwise would take roomfuls of
mathematicians days of mindless calculating Hackers felt
otherwise anything that seemed interesting or fun was fodder for
computingand using interactive computers with no one looking
over your shoulder and demanding clearance for your specific
project you could act on that belief After two or three months
of tangling with intricacies of floatingpoint arithmetic
necessary to allow the program to know where to place the
decimal point on a machine that had no simple method to perform
elementary multiplication Wagner had written three thousand
lines of code that did the job He had made a ridiculously
expensive computer perform the function of a calculator that cost
a thousand times less To honor this irony he called the
program Expensive Desk Calculator and proudly did the homework
for his class on it

His gradezero You used a computer the professor told him
This CANT be right

Wagner didnt even bother to explain How could he convey to his
teacher that the computer was making realities out of what were
once incredible possibilities Or that another hacker had even
written a program called Expensive Typewriter that converted the
TX0 to something you could write text on could process your
writing in strings of characters and print it out on the
Flexowritercould you imagine a professor accepting a classwork
report WRITTEN BY THE COMPUTER How could that professorhow
could in fact anyone who hadnt been immersed in this uncharted
manmachine universeunderstand how Wagner and his fellow
hackers were routinely using the computer to simulate according
to Wagner strange situations which one could scarcely envision
otherwise The professor would learn in time as would
everyone that the world opened up by the computer was a
limitless one

If anyone needed further proof you could cite the project that
Kotok was working on in the Computation Center the chess program
that bearded Al professor Uncle John McCarthy as he was
becoming known to his hacker students had begun on the IBM 704
Even though Kotok and the several other hackers helping him on
the program had only contempt for the IBM batchprocessing
mentality that pervaded the machine and the people around it
they had managed to scrounge some latenight time to use it
interactively and had been engaging in an informal battle with
the systems programmers on the 704 to see which group would be
known as the biggest consumer of computer time The lead would
bounce back and forth and the whiteshirtandblacktie 704
people were impressed enough to actually let Kotok and his group
touch the buttons and switches on the 704 rare sensual contact
with a vaunted IBM beast

Kotoks role in bringing the chess program to life was indicative
of what was to become the hacker role in Artificial Intelligence
a Heavy Head like McCarthy or like his colleague Marvin Minsky
would begin a project or wonder aloud whether something might be
possible and the hackers if it interested them would set about
doing it

The chess program had been started using FORTRAN one of the
early computer languages Computer languages look more like
English than assembly language are easier to write with and do
more things with fewer instructions however each time an
instruction is given in a computer language like FORTRAN the
computer must first translate that command into its own binary
language A program called a compiler does this and the
compiler takes up time to do its job as well as occupying
valuable space within the computer In effect using a computer
language puts you an extra step away from direct contact with the
computer and hackers generally preferred assembly or as they
called it machine language to less elegant higherlevel
languages like FORTRAN

Kotok though recognized that because of the huge amounts of
numbers that would have to be crunched in a chess program part
of the program would have to be done in FORTRAN and part in
assembly They hacked it part by part with move generators
basic data structures and all kinds of innovative algorithms for
strategy After feeding the machine the rules for moving each
piece they gave it some parameters by which to evaluate its
position consider various moves and make the move which would
advance it to the most advantageous situation Kotok kept at it
for years the program growing as MIT kept upgrading its IBM
computers and one memorable night a few hackers gathered to see
the program make some of its first moves in a real game Its opener
was quite respectable but after eight or so exchanges there was real
trouble with the computer about to be checkmated Everybody
wondered how the computer would react It too a while everyone
knew that during those pauses the computer was actually thinking
if your idea of thinking included mechanically considering
various moves evaluating them rejecting most and using a
predefined set of parameters to ultimately make a choice Finally
the computer moved a pawn two squares forwardillegally jumping
over another piece A bug But a clever oneit got the computer
out of check Maybe the program was figuring out some new
algorithm with which to conquer chess

At other universities professors were making public proclamations
that computers would never be able to beat a human being in chess
Hackers knew better They would be the ones who would guide
computers to greater heights than anyone expected And the hackers
by fruitful meaningful association with the computer would be
foremost among the beneficiaries

But they would not be the only beneficiaries Everyone could gain
something by the use of thinking computers in an intellectually
automated world And wouldnt everyone benefit even more by
approaching the world with the same inquisitive intensity
skepticism toward bureaucracy openness to creativity
unselfishness in sharing accomplishments urge to make improvements
and desire to build as those who followed the Hacker Ethic
By accepting others on the same unprejudiced basis by which
computers accepted anyone who entered code into a Flexowriter
Wouldnt we benefit if we learned from computers the means of
creating a perfect system If EVERYONE could interact with
computers with the same innocent productive creative impulse
that hackers did the Hacker Ethic might spread through society
like a benevolent ripple and computers would indeed change
the world for the better

In the monastic confines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
people had the freedom to live out this dreamthe hacker dream
No one dared suggest that the dream might spread Instead people
set about building right there at MIT a hacker Xanadu the likes
of which might never be duplicated

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
