THE PROEM

BY THE CARPENTER


They will tell you in Anchuria that President Miraflores of that
volatile republic died by his own hand in the coast town of Coralio
that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of
an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars
government funds which he carried with him in an American leather
valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never
afterward recovered

For a _real_ a boy will show you his grave It is back of the town
near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp A plain slab of
wood stands at its head Some one has burned upon the headstone with
a hot iron this inscription


 RAMON ANGEL DE LAS CRUZES

 Y MIRAFLORES

 PRESIDENTE DE LA REPUBLICA

 DE ANCHURIA

 QUE SEA SU JUEZ DIOS


It is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man
beyond the grave Let God be his judgeEven with the hundred
thousand unfound though greatly coveted the hue and cry went no
further than that

To the stranger or the guest the people of Coralio will relate the
story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to
escape from the country with the public funds and also with Dona
Isabel Guilbert the young American opera singer and how being
apprehended by members of the opposing political party in Coralio
he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and
in consequence the Senorita Guilbert They will relate further
that Dona Isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the
simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir
hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a
rising tide

They say in Coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide
in the form of Frank Goodwin an American resident of the town an
investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the
countrya banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and
mahogany baron The Senorita Guilbert you will be told married
Senor Goodwin one month after the presidents death thus in the
very moment when Fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a
gift greater than the prize withdrawn

Of the American Don Frank Goodwin and of his wife the natives have
nothing but good to say Don Frank has lived among them for years
and has compelled their respect His lady is easily queen of what
social life the sober coast affords The wife of the governor of the
district herself who was of the proud Castilian family of Monteleon
y Dolorosa de los Santos y Mendez feels honoured to unfold her
napkin with olivehued ringed hands at the table of Senora Goodwin
Were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious
past of Mrs Goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light
opera captured the mature presidents fancy or to her share in that
statesmans downfall and malfeasance the Latin shrug of the shoulder
would be your only answer and rebuttal What prejudices there were
in Coralio concerning Senora Goodwin seemed now to be in her favour
whatever they had been in the past

It would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the
close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground
of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight
instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenuous
web of circumstances

The headpiece bearing the name of President Miraflores is daily
scrubbed with soapbark and sand An old halfbreed Indian tends the
grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth
He chops down the weeds and everspringing grass with his machete he
plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers
and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain There is
no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered

Only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear
why the old Indian Galvez is secretly paid to keep green the
grave of President Miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate
statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in
the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon
that unhonoured mound

Elsewhere than at Coralio one learns of the impetuous career
of Isabel Guilbert New Orleans gave her birth and the mingled
French and Spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such
turbulence and warmth She had little education but a knowledge of
men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct Far beyond the
common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for
the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for
the pleasures of life Her spirit was one to chafe under any curb
she was Eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt
She wore life as a rose in her bosom

Of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but
one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy To President Miraflores
the brilliant but unstable ruler of Anchuria she yielded the key to
her resolute heart How then do we find her as the Coralians would
have told you the wife of Frank Goodwin and happily living a life
of dull and dreamy inaction

The underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea
Following them out it will be made plain why Shorty ODay of the
Columbia Detective Agency resigned his position And for a lighter
pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with Momus
beneath the tropic stars where Melpomene once stalked austere Now to
cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowning crags
where formerly rang the cries of pirates victims to lay aside pike
and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving
titter of mirth from the rusty casque of Romancethis were pleasant
to do in the shade of the lemontrees on that coast that is curved
like lips set for smiling

For there are yet tales of the Spanish Main That segment of
continent washed by the tempestuous Caribbean and presenting to the
sea a formidable border of tropical jungle topped by the overweening
Cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance In past times
buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and
the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves
they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos Taken and
retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of
rebellious factions the historic 300 miles of adventurous coast has
scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master
Pizarro Balboa Sir Francis Drake and Bolivar did what they could
to make it a part of Christendom Sir John Morgan Lafitte and other
eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of
Abaddon

The game still goes on The guns of the rovers are silenced but the
tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist
and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and
carry on the work The hucksters of Germany France and Sicily now
bag its small change across their counters Gentleman adventurers
throng the waitingrooms of its rulers with proposals for railways
and concessions The little _operabouffe_ nations play at government
and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the
offing and warns them not to break their toys And with these changes
comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of
heart busybrainedthe modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock
with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the
beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep Generally he wears a
shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms
and it is he who has driven Melpomene to the wings and set Comedy to
dancing before the footlights of the Southern Cross

So there is a little tale to tell of many things Perhaps to the
promiscuous ear of the Walrus it shall come with most avail for in
it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealingwax and cabbagepalms
and presidents instead of kings

Add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter
everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollarsdollars
warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts
of Fortuneand after all here seems to be Life itself with talk
enough to weary the most garrulous of Walruses

FOXINTHEMORNING


Coralio reclined in the midday heat like some vacuous beauty
lounging in a guarded harem The town lay at the seas edge on a
strip of alluvial coast It was set like a little pearl in an emerald
band Behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it
rose the seafollowing range of the Cordilleras In front the sea
was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the
frowning mountains The waves swished along the smooth beach the
parrots screamed in the orange and ceibatrees the palms waved their
limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donnas
cue to enter

Suddenly the town was full of excitement A native boy dashed down a
grassgrown street shrieking _Busca el Senor Goodwin Ha venido un
telegrafo por el_

The word passed quickly Telegrams do not often come to anyone in
Coralio The cry for Senor Goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious
voices The main street running parallel to the beach became
populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the
despatch Knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive
to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled
_Un telegrafo por Senor Goodwin_ The _comandante_ Don Senor el
Coronel Encarnacion Rios who was loyal to the Ins and suspected
Goodwins devotion to the Outs hissed Aha and wrote in his
secret memorandum book the accusive fact that Senor Goodwin had on
that momentous date received a telegram

In the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small
wooden building and looked out Above the door was a sign that read
Keogh and Clancya nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous
to that tropical soil The man in the door was Billy Keogh scout
of fortune and progress and latterday rover of the Spanish Main
Tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which Keogh and Clancy
were at that time assailing the hopeless shores Outside the shop
were set two large frames filled with specimens of their art and
skill

Keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance
wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound
into the street When the meaning of the disturbance became clear to
him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted Hey Frank in
such a robustious voice that the feeble clamour of the natives was
drowned and silenced

Fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode
of the consul for the United States Out from the door of this
building tumbled Goodwin at the call He had been smoking with
Willard Geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which
was conceded to be the coolest spot in Coralio

Hurry up shouted Keogh Theres a riot in town on account of a
telegram thats come for you You want to be careful about these
things my boy It wont do to trifle with the feelings of the
public this way Youll be getting a pink note some day with violet
scent on it and then the countryll be steeped in the throes of a
revolution

Goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message
The oxeyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew
them He was big blonde and jauntily dressed in white linen with
buckskin _zapatos_ His manner was courtly with a sort of kindly
truculence in it tempered by a merciful eye When the telegram had
been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the
relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which
curiosity had drawn itthe women to their baking in the mud ovens
under the orangetrees or to the interminable combing of their
long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the
cantinas

Goodwin sat on Keoghs doorstep and read his telegram It was from
Bob Englehart an American who lived in San Mateo the capital city
of Anchuria eighty miles in the interior Englehart was a gold
miner an ardent revolutionist and good people That he was a man
of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent
It had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in
Coralio This could not have been accomplished in either Spanish or
English for the eye politic in Anchuria was an active one The Ins
and the Outs were perpetually on their guard But Englehart was a
diplomatist There existed but one code upon which he might make
requisition with promise of safetythe great and potent code of
Slang So here is the message that slipped unconstrued through
the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of Goodwin


 His Nibs skedaddled yesterday per jackrabbit line with all
 the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin hes spoony
 about The boodle is six figures short Our crowd in good
 shape but we need the spondulicks You collar it The main
 guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny You know
 what to do

 BOB


This screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for Goodwin He
was the most successful of the small advanceguard of speculative
Americans that had invaded Anchuria and he had not reached that
enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight
and deduction He had taken up political intrigue as a matter of
business He was acute enough to wield a certain influence among
the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to
purchase the respect of the petty officeholders There was always
a revolutionary party and to it he had always allied himself for
the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their
labours There was now a Liberal party seeking to overturn President
Miraflores If the wheel successfully revolved Goodwin stood to
win a concession to 30000 manzanas of the finest coffee lands in
the interior Certain incidents in the recent career of President
Miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in Goodwins mind that the
government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a
revolution and now Engleharts telegram had come as a corroboration
of his wisdom

The telegram which had remained unintelligible to the Anchurian
linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of Spanish
and elemental English conveyed a stimulating piece of news to
Goodwins understanding It informed him that the president of the
republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the
treasury Furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that
winning adventuress Isabel Guilbert the opera singer whose troupe
of performers had been entertained by the president at San Mateo
during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which
royal visitors are often content The reference to the jackrabbit
line could mean nothing else than the muleback system of transport
that prevailed between Coralio and the capital The hint that the
boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national
treasury lamentably clear Also it was convincingly true that the
ingoing partyits way now made a pacific onewould need the
spondulicks Unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils
held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would
be the position of the new government Therefore it was exceeding
necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war
and government

Goodwin handed the message to Keogh

Read that Billy he said Its from Bob Englehart Can you manage
the cipher

Keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the
telegram

Tis not a cipher he said finally Tis what they call
literature and thats a system of language put in the mouths
of people that theyve never been introduced to by writers of
imagination The magazines invented it but I never knew before that
President Norvin Green had stamped it with the seal of his approval
Tis now no longer literature but language The dictionaries tried
but they couldnt make it go for anything but dialect Sure now that
the Western Union indorses it it wont be long till a race of people
will spring up that speaks it

Youre running too much to philology Billy said Goodwin Do you
make out the meaning of it

Sure replied the philosopher of Fortune All languages come easy
to the man who must know em Ive even failed to misunderstand an
order to evacuate in classical Chinese when it was backed up by the
muzzle of a breechloader This little literary essay I hold in my
hands means a game of FoxintheMorning Ever play that Frank when
you was a kid

I think so said Goodwin laughing You join hands all round
and

You do not interrupted Keogh Youve got a fine sporting game
mixed up in your head with All Around the Rosebush The spirit of
FoxintheMorning is opposed to the holding of hands Ill tell
you how its played This president man and his companion in play
they stand up over in San Mateo ready for the run and shout
FoxintheMorning Me and you standing here we say Goose and
the Gander They say How many miles is it to London town We say
Only a few if your legs are long enough How many comes out They
say More than youre able to catch And then the game commences

I catch the idea said Goodwin It wont do to let the goose
and gander slip through our fingers Billy their feathers are too
valuable Our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of
the government at once but with the treasury empty wed stay in
power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco
We must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their
getting out of the country

By the muleback schedule said Keogh its five days down from
San Mateo Weve got plenty of time to set our outposts Theres only
three places on the coast where they can hope to sail fromhere and
Solitas and Alazan Theyre the only points well have to guard Its
as easy as a chess problemfox to play and mate in three moves Oh
goosey goosey gander whither do you wander By the blessing of the
literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be
preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow
it

The situation had been justly outlined by Keogh The down trail
from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel A
jiggetyjoggety journey it was icecold and hot wet and dry The
trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about
the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snowfed
streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming
with menacing insect and animal life After descending to the
foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at Alazan
Another branched off to Coralio the third penetrated to Solitas
Between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of
alluvial coast Here was the flora of the tropics in its rankest and
most prodigal growth Spaces here and there had been wrested from the
jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves The rest
was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars
alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects Where no road was cut
a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and
creepers Across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without
wings could safely pass Therefore the fugitives could hope to reach
the coast only by one of the routes named

Keep the matter quiet Billy advised Goodwin We dont want
the Ins to know that the president is in flight I suppose Bobs
information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet Otherwise
he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and
besides everybody would have heard the news Im going around now to
see Dr Zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph
wire

As Goodwin rose Keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and
expelled a tremendous sigh

Whats the trouble Billy asked Goodwin pausing Thats the
first time I ever heard you sigh

Tis the last said Keogh With that sorrowful puff of wind I
resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty What
are tintypes if you please to the opportunities of the great
and hilarious class of ganders and geese Not that I would be a
president Frankand the boodle hes got is too big for me to
handlebut in some ways I feel my conscience hurting me for
addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away
with it Frank did you ever see the bundle of muslin that His
Excellency has wrapped up and carried off

Isabel Guilbert said Goodwin laughing No I never did From
what Ive heard of her though I imagine that she wouldnt stick at
anything to carry her point Dont get romantic Billy Sometimes I
begin to fear that theres Irish blood in your ancestry

I never saw her either went on Keogh but they say shes got all
the ladies of mythology sculpture and fiction reduced to chromos
They say she can look at a man once and hell turn monkey and climb
trees to pick cocoanuts for her Think of that president man with
Lord knows how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand and
this muslin siren in the other galloping down hill on a sympathetic
mule amid songbirds and flowers And here is Billy Keogh because he
is virtuous condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the
faces of missing links on tin for an honest living Tis an injustice
of nature

Cheer up said Goodwin You are a pretty poor fox to be envying a
gander Maybe the enchanting Guilbert will take a fancy to you and
your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort

She could do worse reflected Keogh but she wont Tis not a
tintype gallery but the gallery of the gods that shes fitted to
adorn Shes a very wicked lady and the president man is in luck
But I hear Clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the
work And Keogh plunged for the rear of the gallery whistling
gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the
questionable good luck of the flying president

Goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that
intersected it at a right angle

These side streets were covered by a growth of thick rank grass
which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the
police Stone sidewalks little more than a ledge in width ran along
the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses At the outskirts
of the village these streets dwindled to nothing and here were set
the palmthatched huts of the Caribs and the poorer natives and the
shabby cabins of negroes from Jamaica and the West India islands A
few structures raised their heads above the redtiled roofs of the
onestory housesthe bell tower of the _Calaboza_ the Hotel de los
Estranjeros the residence of the Vesuvius Fruit Companys agent
the store and residence of Bernard Brannigan a ruined cathedral in
which Columbus had once set foot and most imposing of all the
Casa Morenathe summer White House of the President of Anchuria
On the principal street running along the beachthe Broadway
of Coraliowere the larger stores the government _bodega_ and
postoffice the _cuartel_ the rumshops and the market place

On his way Goodwin passed the house of Bernard Brannigan It was a
modern wooden building two stories in height The ground floor was
occupied by Brannigans store the upper one contained the living
apartments A wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its
outer walls A handsome vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing
white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon Goodwin She was
no darker than many an Andalusian of high descent and she sparkled
and glowed like a tropical moonlight

Good evening Miss Paula said Goodwin taking off his hat with
his ready smile There was little difference in his manner whether
he addressed women or men Everybody in Coralio liked to receive the
salutation of the big American

Is there any news Mr Goodwin Please dont say no Isnt it
warm I feel just like Mariana in her moated grangeor was it a
rangeits hot enough

No theres no news to tell I believe said Goodwin with a
mischievous look in his eye except that old Geddie is getting
grumpier and crosser every day If something doesnt happen to
relieve his mind Ill have to quit smoking on his back porchand
theres no other place available that is cool enough

He isnt grumpy said Paula Brannigan impulsively when he

But she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening colour for
her mother had been a _mestizo_ lady and the Spanish blood had
brought to Paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other
half of her demonstrative nature




II

THE LOTUS AND THE BOTTLE


Willard Geddie consul for the United States in Coralio was working
leisurely on his yearly report Goodwin who had strolled in as he
did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so
absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the
consul for his lack of hospitality

I shall complain to the civil service department said
Goodwinor is it a departmentperhaps its only a theory One
gets neither civility nor service from you You wont talk and
you wont set out anything to drink What kind of a way is that of
representing your government

Goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully
the quarantine doctor into a game on Coralios solitary billiard
table His plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives
from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to
play

The consul was interested in his report He was only twentyfour and
he had not been in Coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in
the heat of the tropicsa paradox that may be allowed between Cancer
and Capricorn

So many thousand bunches of bananas so many thousand oranges and
cocoanuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee
indigo and sarsaparillaactually exports were twenty per cent
greater than for the previous year

A little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul Perhaps he
thought the State Department upon reading his introduction would
noticeand then he leaned back in his chair and laughed He was
getting as bad as the others For the moment he had forgotten that
Coralio was an insignificant town in an insignificant republic lying
along the byways of a secondrate sea He thought of Gregg the
quarantine doctor who subscribed for the London _Lancet_ expecting
to find it quoting his reports to the home Board of Health concerning
the yellow fever germ The consul knew that not one in fifty of his
acquaintances in the States had ever heard of Coralio He knew that
two men at any rate would have to read his reportsome underling
in the State Department and a compositor in the Public Printing
Office Perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce
in Coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend

He had just written Most unaccountable is the supineness of the
large exporters in the United States in permitting the French and
German houses to practically control the trade interests of this
rich and productive countrywhen he heard the hoarse notes of a
steamers siren

Geddie laid down his pen and gathered his Panama hat and umbrella By
the sound he knew it to be the _Valhalla_ one of the line of fruit
vessels plying for the Vesuvius Company Down to _ninos_ of five
years everyone in Coralio could name you each incoming steamer by
the note of her siren

The consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach By
reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that
by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs
officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded
and inspected according to the laws of Anchuria

There is no harbour at Coralio Vessels of the draught of the
_Valhalla_ must ride at anchor a mile from shore When they take on
fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops At Solitas
where there was a fine harbour ships of many kinds were to be seen
but in the roadstead off Coralio scarcely any save the fruiters
paused Now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from
Spain or a saucy French barque would hang innocently for a few
days in the offing Then the customhouse crew would become doubly
vigilant and wary At night a sloop or two would be making strange
trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of
ThreeStar Hennessey wines and drygoods in Coralio would be found
vastly increased It has also been said that the customs officials
jingled more silver in the pockets of their redstriped trousers and
that the record books showed no increase in import duties received

The customs boat and the _Valhalla_ gig reached the shore at the same
time When they grounded in the shallow water there was still five
yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand Then halfclothed
Caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the
_Valhallas_ purser and the little native officials in their cotton
undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats

At college Geddie had been a treasure as a firstbaseman He now
closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped
with his hands resting upon his knees The purser burlesquing
the pitchers contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of
newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always brought for
him Geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding thwack
The loungers on the beachabout a third of the population of the
townlaughed and applauded delightedly Every week they expected to
see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner
and they were never disappointed Innovations did not flourish in
Coralio

The consul rehoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate

This home of a great nations representative was a wooden structure
of two rooms with a nativebuilt gallery of poles bamboo and
nipa palm running on three sides of it One room was the official
apartment furnished chastely with a flattop desk a hammock and
three uncomfortable caneseated chairs Engravings of the first and
latest president of the country represented hung against the wall
The other room was the consuls living apartment

It was eleven oclock when he returned from the beach and therefore
breakfast time Chanca the Carib woman who cooked for him was just
serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the seaa spot
famous as the coolest in Coralio The breakfast consisted of sharks
fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak
aguacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee

Geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle
of newspapers Here in Coralio for two days or longer he would read
of goingson in the world very much as we of the world read those
whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the
doings of the Martians After he had finished with the papers they
would be sent on the rounds of the other Englishspeaking residents
of the town

The paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky
mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain New
York journals are supposed to take their Sabbath literary nap
Opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its
weight with the aid of the back of a chair Then he partook of his
meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing
half idly at the contents

Presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picturea
halfpage badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel
Languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of
the florid headlines of the column next to the picture

Yes he was not mistaken The engraving was of the eighthundredton
yacht _Idalia_ belonging to that prince of good fellows Midas
of the money market and societys pink of perfection J Ward
Tolliver

Slowly sipping his black coffee Geddie read the column of print
Following a listed statement of Mr Tollivers real estate and bonds
came a description of the yachts furnishings and then the grain of
news no bigger than a mustard seed Mr Tolliver with a party of
favoured guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along
the Central American and South American coasts and among the Bahama
Islands Among the guests were Mrs Cumberland Payne and Miss Ida
Payne of Norfolk

The writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him
by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates
He bracketed the names of Miss Payne and Mr Tolliver until he had
wellnigh read the marriage ceremony over them He played coyly and
insinuatingly upon the strings of _on dit_ and Madame Rumour
and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with
congratulations

Geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of
the gallery and sat there in his favourite steamer chair with his
feet on the bamboo railing He lighted a cigar and looked out upon
the sea He felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little
disturbed by what he had read He told himself that he had conquered
the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far
land of the lotus He could never forget Ida of course but there
was no longer any pain in thinking about her When they had had
that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this
consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching
himself from her world and presence He had succeeded thoroughly in
that During the twelve months of his life in Coralio no word had
passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the
dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote
Still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing
that she had not yet married Tolliver or anyone else But evidently
Tolliver had not yet abandoned hope

Well it made no difference to him now He had eaten of the lotus He
was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon Those old
days of life in the States seemed like an irritating dream He hoped
Ida would be as happy as he was The climate as balmy as that of
distant Avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days
the life among this indolent romantic peoplea life full of music
flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and
mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that
bloomed in the white tropic nightswith all he was more than
content Also there was Paula Brannigan

Geddie intended to marry Paulaif of course she would consent
but he felt rather sure that she would do that Somehow he kept
postponing his proposal Several times he had been quite near to it
but a mysterious something always held him back Perhaps it was only
the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the
last tie that bound him to his old world

He could be very happy with Paula Few of the native girls could be
compared with her She had attended a convent school in New Orleans
for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no
one could detect any difference between her and the girls of Norfolk
and Manhattan But it was delicious to see her at home dressed as
she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and
flowing sleeves

Bernard Brannigan was the great merchant of Coralio Besides his
store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively
trade with the interior towns and villages He had married a native
lady of high Castilian descent but with a tinge of Indian brown
showing through her olive cheek The union of the Irish and the
Spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty
and variety They were very excellent people indeed and the upper
story of their house was ready to be placed at the service of Geddie
and Paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it

By the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading
The papers lay scattered about him on the gallery Reclining there
he gazed dreamily out upon an Eden A clump of banana plants
interposed their broad shields between him and the sun The gentle
slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the darkgreen
foliage of lemontrees and orangetrees just bursting into bloom A
lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a
pale ceibatree rose almost to the clouds The waving cocoanut palms
on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate
of an almost quiescent sea His senses were cognizant of brilliant
scarlet and ochres amid the vert of the coppice of odours of
fruit and bloom and the smoke from Chancas clay oven under the
calabashtree of the treble laughter of the native women in their
huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the
diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shoreand gradually
of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the
drab prospect of the sea

Lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became
the _Idalia_ steaming at full speed coming down the coast Without
changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht
as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to Coralio Then sitting
upright he saw her float steadily past and on Scarcely a mile of
sea had separated her from the shore He had seen the frequent flash
of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deckawningsso
much and no more Like a ship on a magic lantern slide the _Idalia_
had crossed the illuminated circle of the consuls little world and
was gone Save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging
over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a
chimera of his idle brain

Geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report
If the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken
this silent passing of the _Idalia_ had done for him still more
It had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all
uncertainty had been erased He knew that men sometimes hope without
being aware of it Now since she had come two thousand miles and had
passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to
the past any longer

After dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains Geddie
walked on the little strip of beach under the cocoanuts The wind was
blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by
tiny wavelets

A miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand
brought with it something round and shiny that rolled back again as
the wave receded The next influx beached it clear and Geddie picked
it up The thing was a longnecked wine bottle of colourless glass
The cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and
the end covered with darkred sealingwax The bottle contained only
what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation
it had undergone while being inserted In the sealingwax was the
impression of a sealprobably of a signetring bearing the initials
of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the
letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture Ida
Payne had always worn a signetring in preference to any other finger
decoration Geddie thought he could make out the familiar I P and
a queer sensation of disquietude went over him More personal and
intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the
vessel she was doubtless on He walked back to his house and set the
bottle on his desk

Throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lampfor the night had
crowded precipitately upon the brief twilighthe began to examine
his piece of sea salvage

By holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he
made out that it contained a double sheet of notepaper filled with
close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade
as that always used by Ida and that to the best of his belief the
handwriting was hers The imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted
the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but
certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses
were Idas he felt sure

There was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in Geddies
eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side
on his desk He fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and
stretched himself comfortably He would smoke those three cigars
while considering the problem

For it amounted to a problem He almost wished that he had not found
the bottle but the bottle was there Why should it have drifted in
from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his
peace

In this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen
into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters

He began to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the
story of the bottle rejecting each in turn

Ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such
precarious messengers calling for aid But he had seen the _Idalia_
not three hours before safe and speeding Suppose the crew had
mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was
one begging for succour But premising such an improbable outrage
would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages
of notepaper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue

Thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely
theories and was reducedthough averselyto the less assailable
one that the bottle contained a message to himself Ida knew he was
in Coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was
passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore

As soon as Geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his
brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth He sat looking
out through the doorway at the gigantic fireflies traversing the
quiet streets

If this was a message to him from Ida what could it mean save an
overture toward a reconciliation And if that why had she not used
the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even
flippant means of communication A note in an empty bottle cast into
the sea There was something light and frivolous about it if not
actually contemptuous

The thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been
resurrected by the finding of the bottle

Geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out He followed a street
that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was
playing and people were rambling carefree and indolent Some
timorous _senoritas_ scurrying past with fireflies tangled in the
jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes
The air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orangeblossoms

The consul stayed his steps at the house of Bernard Brannigan Paula
was swinging in a hammock on the gallery She rose from it like a
bird from its nest The colour came to her cheek at the sound of
Geddies voice

He was charmed at the sight of her costumea flounced muslin dress
with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and
style He suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old Indian
well on the hill road They sat on the curb and there Geddie made
the expected but longdeferred speech Certain though he had been
that she would not say him nay he was thrilled with joy at the
completeness and sweetness of her surrender Here was surely a heart
made for love and steadfastness Here was no caprice or questionings
or captious standards of convention

When Geddie kissed Paula at her door that night he was happier than
he had ever been before Here in this hollow lotus land ever to
live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many
mariners the best as well as the easiest His future would be an
ideal one He had attained a Paradise without a serpent His Eve
would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more
beguiling He had made his decision tonight and his heart was full
of serene assured content

Geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love
song La Golondrina At the door his tame monkey leaped down from
his shelf chattering briskly The consul turned to his desk to get
him some nuts he usually kept there Reaching in the halfdarkness
his hand struck against the bottle He started as if he had touched
the cold rotundity of a serpent

He had forgotten that the bottle was there

He lighted the lamp and fed the monkey Then very deliberately he
lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the
path to the beach

There was a moon and the sea was glorious The breeze had shifted
as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward

Stepping to the waters edge Geddie hurled the unopened bottle far
out into the sea It disappeared for a moment and then shot upward
twice its length Geddie stood still watching it The moonlight was
so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little
waves Slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it
went The wind was carrying it out to sea Soon it became a mere
speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the
mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean
Geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the
water



SimonOh Simonwake up there Simon bawled a sonorous voice
at the edge of the water

Old Simon Cruz was a halfbreed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a
hut on the beach Out of his earliest nap Simon was thus awakened

He slipped on his shoes and went outside Just landing from one of
the _Valhallas_ boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an
acquaintance of Simons and three sailors from the fruiter

Go up Simon called the mate and find Dr Gregg or Mr Goodwin
or anybody thats a friend to Mr Geddie and bring em here at
once

Saints of the skies said Simon sleepily nothing has happened to
Mr Geddie

Hes under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat
and hes rather more than half drownded We seen him from the
steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a
bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound We lowered the
gig and started for him He nearly had his hand on the bottle when
he gave out and went under We pulled him out in time to save him
maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that

A bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes He was not yet fully
awake Where is the bottle

Driftin along out there someeres said the mate jerking his
thumb toward the sea Get on with you Simon

SMITH


Goodwin and the ardent patriot Zavalla took all the precautions
that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of
President Miraflores and his companion They sent trusted messengers
up the coast to Solitas and Alazan to warn the local leaders of the
flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest
the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that
territory After this was done there remained only to cover the
district about Coralio and await the coming of the quarry The nets
were well spread The roads were so few the opportunities for
embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit
so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip
through the meshes so much of the countrys dignity romance and
collateral The president would without doubt move as secretly
as possible and endeavour to board a vessel by stealth from some
secluded point along the shore

On the fourth day after the receipt of Engleharts telegram the
_Karlsefin_ a Norwegian steamer chartered by the New Orleans fruit
trade anchored off Coralio with three hoarse toots of her siren The
_Karlsefin_ was not one of the line operated by the Vesuvius Fruit
Company She was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a
company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to
the Vesuvius The movements of the _Karlsefin_ were dependent upon
the state of the market Sometimes she would ply steadily between the
Spanish Main and New Orleans in the regular transport of fruit next
she would be making erratic trips to Mobile or Charleston or even
as far north as New York according to the distribution of the fruit
supply

Goodwin lounged upon the beach with the usual crowd of idlers that
had gathered to view the steamer Now that President Miraflores might
be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time
the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch Every vessel
that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means
of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the sloops
and dories that belonged to the seagoing contingent of Coralio
Goodwin and Zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation
watching the loopholes of escape

The customs officials crowded importantly into their boat and rowed
out to the _Karlsefin_ A boat from the steamer landed her purser
with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green
umbrella and clinical thermometer Next a swarm of Caribs began to
load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon
the shore and row them out to the steamer The _Karlsefin_ had
no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the
authorities The purser declared that the steamer would remain at
anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night The
_Karlsefin_ had come he said from New York to which port her
latest load of oranges and cocoanuts had been conveyed Two or three
of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the
captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the
advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the States

About four oclock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters
not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the
fateful _Idalia_a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff
cleancut as a steel engraving The beautiful vessel hovered off
shore seesawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel
A swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a
stockybuilt man leaped to the sands

The newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather
motley congregation of native Anchurians and made his way at once
toward Goodwin who was the most conspicuously AngloSaxon figure
present Goodwin greeted him with courtesy

Conversation developed that the newly landed one was named Smith
and that he had come in a yacht A meagre biography truly for the
yacht was most apparent and the Smith not beyond a reasonable
guess before the revelation Yet to the eye of Goodwin who had seen
several things there was a discrepancy between Smith and his yacht
A bulletheaded man Smith was with an oblique dead eye and the
moustache of a cocktailmixer And unless he had shifted costumes
before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct
vessel clad in a pearlgray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville
neckwear Men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with
them

Smith looked business but he was no advertiser He commented upon
the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the
geography and then inquired for the United States consul Goodwin
pointed out the starredandstriped bunting hanging above the little
consulate which was concealed behind the orangetrees

Mr Geddie the consul will be sure to be there said Goodwin He
was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the
sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time

Smith plowed his way through the sand to the consulate his
haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical
blues and greens

Geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid
in pose On that night when the _Valhallas_ boat had brought him
ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea Doctor Gregg and his
other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of
life that remained to him The bottle with its impotent message was
gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced
to a simple sum in additionone and one make two by the rule of
arithmetic one by the rule of romance

There is a quaint old theory that man may have two soulsa
peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is
stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigour
While under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay
taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport
himself on the average plan But let the central soul suddenly become
dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the
partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his
politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly
insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a
monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himselfor he may
write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to
the search of a microbe Then the peripheral soul will return and we
have our safe sane citizen again It is but the revolt of the Ego
against Order and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they
may settle where they belong

Geddies revulsion had been a mild oneno more than a swim in a
summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle And
now he was himself again Upon his desk ready for the post was a
letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul to be
effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place For
Bernard Brannigan who never did things in a halfway manner was to
take Geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various
enterprises and Paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing
and decorating the upper story of the Brannigan house

The consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger
in his door

Keep your seat old man said the visitor with an airy wave of his
large hand My names Smith and Ive come in a yacht You are the
consulis that right A big cool guy on the beach directed me here
Thought Id pay my respects to the flag

Sit down said Geddie Ive been admiring your craft ever since it
came in sight Looks like a fast sailer Whats her tonnage

Search me said Smith I dont know what she weighs in at But
shes got a tidy gait The _Rambler_thats her namedont take the
dust of anything afloat This is my first trip on her Im taking a
squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where
the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from I had no idea
there was so much scenery down here Why Central Park aint in it
with this neck of the woods Im from New York They get monkeys and
cocoanuts and parrots down hereis that right

We have them all said Geddie Im quite sure that our fauna and
flora would take a prize over Central Park

Maybe they would admitted Smith cheerfully I havent seen them
yet But I guess youve got us skinned on the animal and vegetation
question You dont have much travel here do you

Travel queried the consul I suppose you mean passengers on the
steamers No very few people land in Coralio An investor now and
thentourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to
one of the larger towns where there is a harbour

I see a ship out there loading up with bananas said Smith Any
passengers come on her

Thats the _Karlsefin_ said the consul Shes a tramp
fruitermade her last trip to New York I believe No she brought
no passengers I saw her boat come ashore and there was no one
About the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers
when they arrive and a passenger on one of them generally causes
the whole town to turn out If you are going to remain in Coralio
a while Mr Smith Ill be glad to take you around to meet some
people There are four or five American chaps that are good to know
besides the native highfliers

Thanks said the yachtsman but I wouldnt put you to the trouble
Id like to meet the guys you speak of but I wont be here long
enough to do much knocking around That cool gent on the beach spoke
of a doctor can you tell me where I could find him The _Rambler_
aint quite as steady on her feet as a Broadway hotel and a fellow
gets a touch of seasickness now and then Thought Id strike the
croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills in case I need em

You will be apt to find Dr Gregg at the hotel said the consul
You can see it from the doorits that twostory building with the
balcony where the orangetrees are

The Hotel de los Estranjeros was a dreary hostelry in great disuse
both by strangers and friends It stood at a corner of the Street of
the Holy Sepulchre A grove of small orangetrees crowded against one
side of it enclosed by a low rock wall over which a tall man might
easily step The house was of plastered adobe stained a hundred
shades of colour by the salt breeze and the sun Upon its upper
balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad
jalousies instead of sashes

The lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow
rockpaved sidewalk The _pulperia_or drinking shopof the
proprietress Madama Timotea Ortiz occupied the ground floor On the
bottles of brandy _anisada_ Scotch smoke and inexpensive wines
behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers
of infrequent customers had left irregular prints The upper story
contained four or five guestrooms which were rarely put to their
destined use Sometimes a fruitgrower riding in from his plantation
to confer with his agent would pass a melancholy night in the dismal
upper story sometimes a minor native official on some trifling
government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by Madamas
sepulchral hospitality But Madama sat behind her bar content not
desiring to quarrel with Fate If anyone required meat drink or
lodging at the Hotel de los Estranjeros they had but to come and be
served _Esta bueno_ If they came not why then they came not
_Esta bueno_

As the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious
sidewalk of the Street of the Holy Sepulchre the solitary permanent
guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door enjoying the breeze
from the sea

Dr Gregg the quarantine physician was a man of fifty or sixty
with a florid face and the longest beard between Topeka and Terra
del Fuego He held his position by virtue of an appointment by the
Board of Health of a seaport city in one of the Southern states
That city feared the ancient enemy of every Southern seaportthe
yellow feverand it was the duty of Dr Gregg to examine crew and
passengers of every vessel leaving Coralio for preliminary symptoms
The duties were light and the salary for one who lived in Coralio
ample Surplus time there was in plenty and the good doctor added
to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the
coast The fact that he did not know ten words of Spanish was no
obstacle a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being
a linguist Add to the description the facts that the doctor had
a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no
listener had ever allowed him to conclude and that he believed
in brandy as a prophylactic and the special points of interest
possessed by Dr Gregg will have become exhausted

The doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk He was coatless and
he leaned back against the wall and smoked while he stroked his
beard Surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of
Smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes

Youre Dr Greggis that right said Smith feeling the dogs head
pin in his tie The constableI mean the consul told me you hung
out at this caravansary My names Smith and I came in a yacht
Taking a cruise around looking at the monkeys and pineappletrees
Come inside and have a drink Doc This cafe looks on the blink but
I guess it can set out something wet

I will join you sir in just a taste of brandy said Dr Gregg
rising quickly I find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is
almost a necessity in this climate

As they turned to enter the _pulperia_ a native man barefoot
glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in Spanish He was
yellowishbrown like an overripe lemon he wore a cotton shirt and
ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt His face was like an
animals live and wary but without promise of much intelligence
This man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it
seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted

Dr Gregg felt his pulse

You sick he inquired

_Mi mujer esta enferma en la casa_ said the man thus endeavouring
to convey the news in the only language open to him that his wife
lay ill in her palmthatched hut

The doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from
his trousers pocket He counted out ten of them into the natives
hand and held up his forefinger impressively

Take one said the doctor every two hours He then held up two
fingers shaking them emphatically before the natives face Next he
pulled out his watch and ran his finger round its dial twice Again
the two fingers confronted the patients nose Twotwotwo hours
repeated the doctor

_Si Senor_ said the native sadly

He pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in
the doctors hand Me bring said he struggling painfully with
his scant English other watchy tomorrow Then he departed
downheartedly with his capsules

A very ignorant race of people sir said the doctor as he slipped
the watch into his pocket He seems to have mistaken my directions
for taking the physic for the fee However it is all right He owes
me an account anyway The chances are that he wont bring the other
watch You cant depend on anything they promise you About that
drink now How did you come to Coralio Mr Smith I was not aware
that any boats except the _Karlsefin_ had arrived for some days

The two leaned against the deserted bar and Madama set out a bottle
without waiting for the doctors order There was no dust on it

After they had drank twice Smith said

You say there were no passengers on the _Karlsefin_ Doc Are you
sure about that It seems to me I heard somebody down on the beach
say that there was one or two aboard

They were mistaken sir I myself went out and put all hands through
a medical examination as usual The _Karlsefin_ sails as soon as she
gets her bananas loaded which will be about daylight in the morning
and she got everything ready this afternoon No sir there was no
passenger list Like that ThreeStar A French schooner landed two
slooploads of it a month ago If any customs duties on it went to the
distinguished republic of Anchuria you may have my hat If you wont
have another come out and lets sit in the cool a while It isnt
often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside
world

The doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new
acquaintance The two seated themselves

You are a man of the world said Dr Gregg a man of travel and
experience Your decision in a matter of ethics and no doubt on
the points of equity ability and professional probity should be of
value I would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case
that I think stands unique in medical annals

About nine years ago while I was engaged in the practice of
medicine in my native city I was called to treat a case of contusion
of the skull I made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was
pressing upon the brain and that the surgical operation known as
trepanning was required However as the patient was a gentleman of
wealth and position I called in for consultation Dr

Smith rose from his chair and laid a hand soft with apology upon
the doctors shirt sleeve

Say Doc he said solemnly I want to hear that story Youve got
me interested and I dont want to miss the rest of it I know its a
loola by the way it begins and I want to tell it at the next meeting
of the Barney OFlynn Association if you dont mind But Ive got
one or two matters to attend to first If I get em attended to
in time Ill come right back and hear you spiel the rest before
bedtimeis that right

By all means said the doctor get your business attended to
and then return I shall wait up for you You see one of the most
prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a
blood clot another said it was an abscess but I

Dont tell me now Doc Dont spoil the story Wait till I come
back I want to hear it as it runs off the reelis that right

The mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level
gallop of Apollos homing steeds the day died in the lagoons and
in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps where the
great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly
ramble And it died at last upon the highest peaks Then the brief
twilight ephemeral as the flight of a moth came and went the
Southern Cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms
and the fireflies heralded with their torches the approach of
softfooted night

In the offing the _Karlsefin_ swayed at anchor her lights seeming
to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering
lanceolate reflections The Caribs were busy loading her by means of
the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon
the shore

On the sandy beach with his back against a cocoanuttree and the
stubs of many cigars lying around him Smith sat waiting never
relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer

The incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the
innocent fruiter Twice had he been assured that no passengers had
come to Coralio on board of her And yet with a persistence not to
be attributed to an idling voyager he had appealed the case to the
higher court of his own eyesight Surprisingly like some gaycoated
lizard he crouched at the foot of the cocoanut palm and with the
beady shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile sustained his espionage
on the _Karlsefin_

On the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up
guarded by one of the whiteducked crew Not far away in a _pulperia_
on the shorefollowing Calle Grande three other sailors swaggered
with their cues around Coralios solitary billiardtable The boat
lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment There
was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation of waiting for something
to occur which was foreign to the air of Coralio

Like some passing bird of brilliant plumage Smith alights on this
palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly
away upon silent pinions When morning dawned there was no Smith no
waiting gig no yacht in the offing Smith left no intimation of his
mission there no footprints to show where he had followed the trail
of his mystery on the sands of Coralio that night He came he spake
his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes he sat under the
cocoanuttree and vanished The next morning Coralio Smithless
ate its fried plantain and said The man of pictured clothing went
himself away With the _siesta_ the incident passed yawning into
history

So for a time must Smith pass behind the scenes of the play He
comes no more to Coralio nor to Doctor Gregg who sits in vain
wagging his redundant beard waiting to enrich his derelict audience
with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy

But prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages Smith shall
flutter among them again In the nick of time he shall come to tell
us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the cocoanut
palm that night This he must do for when he sailed away before
the dawn in his yacht _Rambler_ he carried with him the answer to a
riddle so big and preposterous that few in Anchuria had ventured even
to propound it




IV

CAUGHT


The plans for the detention of the flying President Miraflores
and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail
Dr Zavalla himself had gone to the port of Alazan to establish a
guard at that point At Solitas the Liberal patriot Varras could be
depended upon to keep close watch Goodwin held himself responsible
for the district about Coralio

The news of the presidents flight had been disclosed to no one in
the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party
that was desirous of succeeding to power The telegraph wire running
from San Mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail
by an emissary of Zavallas Long before this could be repaired and
word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have
reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved

Goodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the
shore for a mile in each direction from Coralio They were instructed
to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent Miraflores
from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop
found by chance at the waters edge A dozen patrols walked the
streets of Coralio unsuspected ready to intercept the truant
official should he show himself there

Goodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been
overlooked He strolled about the streets that bore such
highsounding names and were but narrow grasscovered lanes lending
his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by Bob
Englehart

The town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions A few
leisurely dandies clad in white duck with flowing neckties and
swinging slim bamboo canes threaded the grassy byways toward the
houses of their favoured senoritas Those who wooed the art of music
dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas or fingered lugubrious
guitars at doors and windows An occasional soldier from the
_cuartel_ with flapping straw hat without coat or shoes hurried
by balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand From every
density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and
irritating clatter Further out where the byways perished at the
brink of the jungle the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the
coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain
silence of the wood

By ten oclock the streets were deserted The oil lamps that had
burned a sickly yellow at random corners had been extinguished
by some economical civic agent Coralio lay sleeping calmly between
toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms
of its abductors Somewhere over in that tropical darknessperhaps
already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlandsthe high
adventurer and his mate were moving toward lands end The game of
FoxintheMorning should be coming soon to its close

Goodwin at his deliberate gait passed the long low _cuartel_ where
Coralios contingent of Anchurias military force slumbered with its
bare toes pointed heavenward There was a law that no civilian might
come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine
oclock but Goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes

_Quien vive_ shrieked the sentinel wrestling prodigiously with
his lengthy musket

_Americano_ growled Goodwin without turning his head and passed
on unhalted

To the right he turned and to the left up the street that ultimately
reached the Plaza Nacional When within the toss of a cigar stump
from the intersecting Street of the Holy Sepulchre he stopped
suddenly in the pathway

He saw the form of a tall man clothed in black and carrying a large
valise hurry down the crossstreet in the direction of the beach
And Goodwins second glance made him aware of a woman at the mans
elbow on the farther side who seemed to urge forward if not even to
assist her companion in their swift but silent progress They were
no Coralians those two

Goodwin followed at increased speed but without any of the artful
tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth The American was
too broad to feel the instinct of the detective He stood as an agent
for the people of Anchuria and but for political reasons he would
have demanded then and there the money It was the design of his
party to secure the imperilled fund to restore it to the treasury
of the country and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or
resistance

The couple halted at the door of the Hotel de los Estranjeros and
the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his
entry being stayed Madama was long in response but after a time her
light showed the door was opened and the guests housed

Goodwin stood in the quiet street lighting another cigar In
two minutes a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the
jalousies in the upper story of the hotel They have engaged rooms
said Goodwin to himself So then their arrangements for sailing
have yet to be made

At that moment there came along one Esteban Delgado a barber an
enemy to existing government a jovial plotter against stagnation
in any form This barber was one of Coralios saddest dogs often
remaining out of doors as late as eleven post meridian He was a
partisan Liberal and he greeted Goodwin with flatulent importance as
a brother in the cause But he had something important to tell

What think you Don Frank he cried in the universal tone of the
conspirator I have tonight shaved _la barba_what you call the
weeskers of the _Presidente_ himself of this countree Consider
He sent for me to come In the poor _casita_ of an old woman he
awaited mein a verree leetle house in a dark place _Carramba_el
Senor Presidente to make himself thus secret and obscured I think he
desired not to be knownbut _carajo_ can you shave a man and not
see his face This gold piece he gave me and said it was to be all
quite still I think Don Frank there is what you call a chip over
the bug

Have you ever seen President Miraflores before asked Goodwin

But once answered Esteban He is tall and he had weeskers
verree black and sufficient

Was anyone else present when you shaved him

An old Indian woman Senor that belonged with the _casa_ and one
senoritaa ladee of so much beautee_ah Dios_

All right Esteban said Goodwin Its very lucky that
you happened along with your tonsorial information The new
administration will be likely to remember you for this

Then in a few words he made the barber acquainted with the crisis
into which the affairs of the nation had culminated and instructed
him to remain outside keeping watch upon the two sides of the hotel
that looked upon the street and observing whether anyone should
attempt to leave the house by any door or window Goodwin himself
went to the door through which the guests had entered opened it and
stepped inside

Madama had returned downstairs from her journey above to see after
the comfort of her lodgers Her candle stood upon the bar She was
about to take a thimbleful of rum as a solace for having her rest
disturbed She looked up without surprise or alarm as her third
caller entered

Ah it is the Senor Goodwin Not often does he honour my poor house
by his presence

I must come oftener said Goodwin with the Goodwin smile I hear
that your cognac is the best between Belize to the north and Rio to
the south Set out the bottle Madama and let us have the proof in
_un vasito_ for each of us

My _aguardiente_ said Madama with pride is the best It grows
in beautiful bottles in the dark places among the bananatrees _Si
Senor_ Only at midnight can they be picked by sailormen who bring
them before daylight comes to your back door Good _aguardiente_ is
a verree difficult fruit to handle Senor Goodwin

Smuggling in Coralio was much nearer than competition to being the
life of trade One spoke of it slyly yet with a certain conceit
when it had been well accomplished

You have guests in the house tonight said Goodwin laying a
silver dollar upon the counter

Why not said Madama counting the change Two but the smallest
while finished to arrive One senor not quite old and one senorita
of sufficient handsomeness To their rooms they have ascended not
desiring the toeat nor the todrink Two rooms_Numero_ 9 and
_Numero_ 10

I was expecting that gentleman and that lady said Goodwin I have
important _negocios_ that must be transacted Will you allow me to
see them

Why not sighed Madama placidly Why should not Senor Goodwin
ascend and speak to his friends _Esta bueno_ Room _Numero_ 9 and
room _Numero_ 10

Goodwin loosened in his coat pocket the American revolver that he
carried and ascended the steep dark stairway

In the hallway above the saffron light from a hanging lamp allowed
him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors He turned the knob of
Number 9 entered and closed the door behind him

If that was Isabel Guilbert seated by the table in that poorly
furnished room report had failed to do her charms justice She
rested her head upon one hand Extreme fatigue was signified in every
line of her figure and upon her countenance a deep perplexity was
written Her eyes were grayirised and of that mould that seems to
have belonged to the orbs of all the famous queens of hearts Their
whites were singularly clear and brilliant concealed above the
irises by heavy horizontal lids and showing a snowy line below them
Such eyes denote great nobility vigour and if you can conceive of
it a most generous selfishness She looked up when the American
entered with an expression of surprised inquiry but without alarm

Goodwin took off his hat and seated himself with his characteristic
deliberate ease upon a corner of the table He held a lighted cigar
between his fingers He took this familiar course because he was sure
that preliminaries would be wasted upon Miss Guilbert He knew her
history and the small part that the conventions had played in it

Good evening he said Now madame let us come to business at
once You will observe that I mention no names but I know who is in
the next room and what he carries in that valise That is the point
which brings me here I have come to dictate terms of surrender

The lady neither moved nor replied but steadily regarded the cigar
in Goodwins hand

We continued the dictator thoughtfully regarding the neat
buckskin shoe on his gently swinging footI speak for a
considerable majority of the peopledemand the return of the stolen
funds belonging to them Our terms go very little further than that
They are very simple As an accredited spokesman I promise that our
interference will cease if they are accepted Give up the money and
you and your companion will be permitted to proceed wherever you
will In fact assistance will be given you in the matter of securing
a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose It is on my personal
responsibility that I add congratulations to the gentleman in Number
10 upon his taste in feminine charms

Returning his cigar to his mouth Goodwin observed her and saw that
her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant
concentration Apparently she had not heard a word he had said He
understood tossed the cigar out the window and with an amused
laugh slid from the table to his feet

That is better said the lady It makes it possible for me to
listen to you For a second lesson in good manners you might now
tell me by whom I am being insulted

I am sorry said Goodwin leaning one hand on the table that my
time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette
Come now I appeal to your good sense You have shown yourself
in more than one instance to be well aware of what is to your
advantage This is an occasion that demands the exercise of your
undoubted intelligence There is no mystery here I am Frank Goodwin
and I have come for the money I entered this room at a venture Had
I entered the other I would have had it before now Do you want it in
words The gentleman in Number 10 has betrayed a great trust He has
robbed his people of a large sum and it is I who will prevent their
losing it I do not say who that gentleman is but if I should be
forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official
of the republic it will be my duty to arrest him The house is
guarded I am offering you liberal terms It is not absolutely
necessary that I confer personally with the gentleman in the next
room Bring me the valise containing the money and we will call the
affair ended

The lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment thinking
deeply

Do you live here Mr Goodwin she asked presently

Yes

What is your authority for this intrusion

I am an instrument of the republic I was advised by wire of the
movements of thegentleman in Number 10

May I ask you two or three questions I believe you to be a man more
apt to be truthful thantimid What sort of a town is thisCoralio
I think they call it

Not much of a town said Goodwin smiling A banana town as they
run Grass huts dobes five or six twostory houses accommodations
limited population halfbreed Spanish and Indian Caribs and
blackamoors No sidewalks to speak of no amusements Rather unmoral
Thats an offhand sketch of course

Are there any inducements say in a social or in a business way for
people to reside here

Oh yes answered Goodwin smiling broadly There are no afternoon
teas no handorgans no department storesand there is no
extradition treaty

He told me went on the lady speaking as if to herself and with
a slight frown that there were towns on this coast of beauty and
importance that there was a pleasing social orderespecially an
American colony of cultured residents

There is an American colony said Goodwin gazing at her in some
wonder Some of the members are all right Some are fugitives
from justice from the States I recall two exiled bank presidents
one army paymaster under a cloud a couple of manslayers and a
widowarsenic I believe was the suspicion in her case I myself
complete the colony but as yet I have not distinguished myself by
any particular crime

Do not lose hope said the lady dryly I see nothing in your
actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity Some mistake
has been made I do not know just where But _him_ you shall not
disturb tonight The journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen
asleep I think in his clothes You talk of stolen money I do not
understand you Some mistake has been made I will convince you
Remain where you are and I will bring you the valise that you seem to
covet so and show it to you

She moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms but
stopped and half turned and bestowed upon Goodwin a grave searching
look that ended in a quizzical smile

You force my door she said and you follow your ruffianly
behaviour with the basest accusations and yetshe hesitated as if
to reconsider what she was about to sayand yetit is a puzzling
thingI am sure there has been some mistake

She took a step toward the door but Goodwin stayed her by a light
touch upon her arm I have said before that women turned to look at
him in the streets He was the viking sort of man big goodlooking
and with an air of kindly truculence She was dark and proud glowing
or pale as her mood moved her I do not know if Eve were light or
dark but if such a woman had stood in the garden I know that the
apple would have been eaten This woman was to be Goodwins fate
and he did not know it but he must have felt the first throes of
destiny for as he faced her the knowledge of what report named her
turned bitter in his throat

If there has been any mistake he said hotly it was yours I do
not blame the man who has lost his country his honour and is about
to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as I blame
you for by Heaven I can very well see how he was brought to it
I can understand and pity him It is such women as you that strew
this degraded coast with wretched exiles that make men forget their
trusts that drag

The lady interrupted him with a weary gesture

There is no need to continue your insults she said coldly
I do not understand what you are saying nor do I know what mad
blunder you are making but if the inspection of the contents of
a gentlemans portmanteau will rid me of you let us delay it no
longer

She passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room and returned
with the heavy leather valise which she handed to the American with
an air of patient contempt

Goodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten
the straps The lady stood by with an expression of infinite scorn
and weariness upon her face

The valise opened wide to a powerful sidelong wrench Goodwin
dragged out two or three articles of clothing exposing the bulk of
its contentspackage after package of tightly packed United States
bank and treasury notes of large denomination Reckoning from the
high figures written upon the paper bands that bound them the total
must have come closely upon the hundred thousand mark

Goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman and saw with surprise and a
thrill of pleasure that he wondered at that she had experienced
an unmistakable shock Her eyes grew wide she gasped and leaned
heavily against the table She had been ignorant then he inferred
that her companion had looted the government treasury But why he
angrily asked himself should he be so well pleased to think this
wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted
her

A noise in the other room startled them both The door swung open
and a tall elderly dark complexioned man recently shaven hurried
into the room

All the pictures of President Miraflores represent him as the
possessor of a luxuriant supply of dark and carefully tended
whiskers but the story of the barber Esteban had prepared Goodwin
for the change

The man stumbled in from the dark room his eyes blinking at the
lamplight and heavy from sleep

What does this mean he demanded in excellent English with a keen
and perturbed look at the Americanrobbery

Very near it answered Goodwin But I rather think Im in time to
prevent it I represent the people to whom this money belongs and
I have come to convey it back to them He thrust his hand into a
pocket of his loose linen coat

The other mans hand went quickly behind him

Dont draw called Goodwin sharply Ive got you covered from my
pocket

The lady stepped forward and laid one hand upon the shoulder of
her hesitating companion She pointed to the table Tell me the
truththe truth she said in a low voice Whose money is that

The man did not answer He gave a deep longdrawn sigh leaned and
kissed her on the forehead stepped back into the other room and
closed the door

Goodwin foresaw his purpose and jumped for the door but the report
of the pistol echoed as his hand touched the knob A heavy fall
followed and some one swept him aside and struggled into the room of
the fallen man

A desolation thought Goodwin greater than that derived from
the loss of cavalier and gold must have been in the heart of the
enchantress to have wrung from her in that moment the cry of one
turning to the allforgiving allcomforting earthly consolerto
have made her call out from that bloody and dishonoured roomOh
mother mother mother

But there was an alarm outside The barber Esteban at the sound
of the shot had raised his voice and the shot itself had aroused
half the town A pattering of feet came up the street and official
orders rang out on the still air Goodwin had a duty to perform
Circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted countrys
treasure Swiftly cramming the money into the valise he closed it
leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick orangetree
in the little inclosure below



They will tell you in Coralio as they delight in telling the
stranger of the conclusion of that tragic flight They will tell
you how the upholders of the law came apace when the alarm was
soundedthe _Comandante_ in red slippers and a jacket like a head
waiters and girded sword the soldiers with their interminable guns
followed by outnumbering officers struggling into their gold lace and
epaulettes the barefooted policemen the only capables in the lot
and ruffled citizens of every hue and description

They say that the countenance of the dead man was marred sadly by the
effects of the shot but he was identified as the fallen president
by both Goodwin and the barber Esteban On the next morning messages
began to come over the mended telegraph wire and the story of the
flight from the capital was given out to the public In San Mateo the
revolutionary party had seized the sceptre of government without
opposition and the _vivas_ of the mercurial populace quickly effaced
the interest belonging to the unfortunate Miraflores

They will relate to you how the new government sifted the towns and
raked the roads to find the valise containing Anchurias surplus
capital which the president was known to have carried with him but
all in vain In Coralio Senor Goodwin himself led the searching party
which combed that town as carefully as a woman combs her hair but
the money was not found

So they buried the dead man without honours back of the town near
the little bridge that spans the mangrove swamp and for a _real_ a
boy will show you his grave They say that the old woman in whose hut
the barber shaved the president placed the wooden slab at his head
and burned the inscription upon it with a hot iron

You will hear also that Senor Goodwin like a tower of strength
shielded Dona Isabel Guilbert through those subsequent distressful
days and that his scruples as to her past career if he had any
vanished and her adventuresome waywardness if she had any left
her and they were wedded and were happy

The American built a home on a little foothill near the town It is a
conglomerate structure of native woods that exported would be worth
a fortune and of brick palm glass bamboo and adobe There is a
paradise of nature about it and something of the same sort within
The natives speak of its interior with hands uplifted in admiration
There are floors polished like mirrors and covered with handwoven
Indian rugs of silk fibre tall ornaments and pictures musical
instruments and papered wallsfigureittoyourself they exclaim

But they cannot tell you in Coralio as you shall learn what became
of the money that Frank Goodwin dropped into the orangetree But
that shall come later for the palms are fluttering in the breeze
bidding us to sport and gaiety




V

CUPIDS EXILE NUMBER TWO


The United States of America after looking over its stock of
consular timber selected Mr John De Graffenreid Atwood of
Dalesburg Alabama for a successor to Willard Geddie resigned

Without prejudice to Mr Atwood it will have to be acknowledged
that in this instance it was the man who sought the office As with
the selfbanished Geddie it was nothing less than the artful smiles
of lovely woman that had driven Johnny Atwood to the desperate
expedient of accepting office under a despised Federal Government so
that he might go far far away and never see again the false fair
face that had wrecked his young life The consulship at Coralio
seemed to offer a retreat sufficiently removed and romantic enough
to inject the necessary drama into the pastoral scenes of Dalesburg
life

It was while playing the part of Cupids exile that Johnny added his
handiwork to the long list of casualties along the Spanish Main by
his famous manipulation of the shoe market and his unparalleled feat
of elevating the most despised and useless weed in his own country
from obscurity to be a valuable product in international commerce

The trouble began as trouble often begins instead of ending with a
romance In Dalesburg there was a man named Elijah Hemstetter who
kept a general store His family consisted of one daughter called
Rosine a name that atoned much for Hemstetter This young woman
was possessed of plentiful attractions so that the young men of the
community were agitated in their bosoms Among the more agitated
was Johnny the son of Judge Atwood who lived in the big colonial
mansion on the edge of Dalesburg

It would seem that the desirable Rosine should have been pleased to
return the affection of an Atwood a name honoured all over the state
long before and since the war It does seem that she should have
gladly consented to have been led into that stately but rather empty
colonial mansion But not so There was a cloud on the horizon a
threatening cumulus cloud in the shape of a lively and shrewd young
farmer in the neighbourhood who dared to enter the lists as a rival
to the highborn Atwood

One night Johnny propounded to Rosine a question that is considered
of much importance by the young of the human species The accessories
were all theremoonlight oleanders magnolias the mockbirds
song Whether or no the shadow of Pinkney Dawson the prosperous
young farmer came between them on that occasion is not known but
Rosines answer was unfavourable Mr John De Graffenreid Atwood
bowed till his hat touched the lawn grass and went away with his
head high but with a sore wound in his pedigree and heart A
Hemstetter refuse an Atwood Zounds

Among other accidents of that year was a Democratic president Judge
Atwood was a warhorse of Democracy Johnny persuaded him to set the
wheels moving for some foreign appointment He would go awayaway
Perhaps in years to come Rosine would think how true how faithful
his love had been and would drop a tearmaybe in the cream she
would be skimming for Pink Dawsons breakfast

The wheels of politics revolved and Johnny was appointed consul to
Coralio Just before leaving he dropped in at Hemstetters to say
goodbye There was a queer pinkish look about Rosines eyes and
had the two been alone the United States might have had to cast
about for another consul But Pink Dawson was there of course
talking about his 400acre orchard and the threemile alfalfa tract
and the 200acre pasture So Johnny shook hands with Rosine as coolly
as if he were only going to run up to Montgomery for a couple of
days They had the royal manner when they chose those Atwoods

If you happen to strike anything in the way of a good investment
down there Johnny said Pink Dawson just let me know will you I
reckon I could lay my hands on a few extra thousands most any time
for a profitable deal

Certainly Pink said Johnny pleasantly If I strike anything of
the sort Ill let you in with pleasure

So Johnny went down to Mobile and took a fruit steamer for the coast
of Anchuria

When the new consul arrived in Coralio the strangeness of the scenes
diverted him much He was only twentytwo and the grief of youth is
not worn like a garment as it is by older men It has its seasons
when it reigns and then it is unseated for a time by the assertion
of the keen senses

Billy Keogh and Johnny seemed to conceive a mutual friendship at
once Keogh took the new consul about town and presented him to the
handful of Americans and the smaller number of French and Germans
who made up the foreign contingent And then of course he had to
be more formally introduced to the native officials and have his
credentials transmitted through an interpreter

There was something about the young Southerner that the sophisticated
Keogh liked His manner was simple almost to boyishness but he
possessed the cool carelessness of a man of far greater age and
experience Neither uniforms nor titles red tape nor foreign
languages mountains nor sea weighed upon his spirits He was heir
to all the ages an Atwood of Dalesburg and you might know every
thought conceived in his bosom

Geddie came down to the consulate to explain the duties and workings
of the office He and Keogh tried to interest the new consul in their
description of the work that his government expected him to perform

Its all right said Johnny from the hammock that he had set up as
the official reclining place If anything turns up that has to be
done Ill let you fellows do it You cant expect a Democrat to work
during his first term of holding office

You might look over these headings suggested Geddie of the
different lines of exports you will have to keep account of The
fruit is classified and there are the valuable woods coffee
rubber

That last account sounds all right interrupted Mr Atwood Sounds
as if it could be stretched I want to buy a new flag a monkey a
guitar and a barrel of pineapples Will that rubber account stretch
over em

Thats merely statistics said Geddie smiling The expense
account is what you want It is supposed to have a slight elasticity
The stationery items are sometimes carelessly audited by the State
Department

Were wasting our time said Keogh This man was born to hold
office He penetrates to the root of the art at one step of his eagle
eye The true genius of government shows its hand in every word of
his speech

I didnt take this job with any intention of working explained
Johnny lazily I wanted to go somewhere in the world where they
didnt talk about farms There are none here are there

Not the kind you are acquainted with answered the exconsul
There is no such art here as agriculture There never was a plow or
a reaper within the boundaries of Anchuria

This is the country for me murmured the consul and immediately he
fell asleep

The cheerful tintypist pursued his intimacy with Johnny in spite
of open charges that he did so to obtain a preemption on a seat in
that coveted spot the rear gallery of the consulate But whether
his designs were selfish or purely friendly Keogh achieved that
desirable privilege Few were the nights on which the two could not
be found reposing there in the sea breeze with their heels on the
railing and the cigars and brandy conveniently near

One evening they sat thus mainly silent for their talk had dwindled
before the stilling influence of an unusual night

There was a great full moon and the sea was motherofpearl Almost
every sound was hushed for the air was but faintly stirring and
the town lay panting waiting for the night to cool Offshore lay
the fruit steamer _Andador_ of the Vesuvius line fullladen and
scheduled to sail at six in the morning There were no loiterers on
the beach So bright was the moonlight that the two men could see the
small pebbles shining on the beach where the gentle surf wetted them

Then down the coast tacking close to shore slowly swam a little
sloop whitewinged like some snowy sea fowl Its course lay within
twenty points of the winds eye so it veered in and out again in
long slow strokes like the movements of a graceful skater

Again the tactics of its crew brought it close in shore this time
nearly opposite the consulate and then there blew from the sloop
clear and surprising notes as if from a horn of elfland A fairy
bugle it might have been sweet and silvery and unexpected playing
with spirit the familiar air of Home Sweet Home

It was a scene set for the land of the lotus The authority of the
sea and the tropics the mystery that attends unknown sails and the
prestige of drifting music on moonlit waters gave it an anodynous
charm Johnny Atwood felt it and thought of Dalesburg but as soon
as Keoghs mind had arrived at a theory concerning the peripatetic
solo he sprang to the railing and his earrending yawp fractured the
silence of Coralio like a cannon shot

Mellinger ahoy

The sloop was now on its outward tack but from it came a clear
answering hail

Goodbye Billy    going homebye

The _Andador_ was the sloops destination No doubt some passenger
with a sailing permit from some upthecoast point had come down in
this sloop to catch the regular fruit steamer on its return trip
Like a coquettish pigeon the little boat tacked on its eccentric way
until at last its white sail was lost to sight against the larger
bulk of the fruiters side

Thats old H P Mellinger explained Keogh dropping back into his
chair Hes going back to New York He was private secretary of the
late hotfoot president of this grocery and fruit stand that they
call a country His jobs over now and I guess old Mellinger is
glad

Why does he disappear to music like Zozo the magic queen asked
Johnny Just to show em that he doesnt care

That noise you heard is a phonograph said Keogh I sold him that
Mellinger had a graft in this country that was the only thing of its
kind in the world The tooting machine saved it for him once and he
always carried it around with him afterward

Tell me about it demanded Johnny betraying interest

Im no disseminator of narratives said Keogh I can use language
for purposes of speech but when I attempt a discourse the words
come out as they will and they may make sense when they strike the
atmosphere or they may not

I want to hear about that graft persisted Johnny Youve got
no right to refuse Ive told you all about every man woman and
hitching post in Dalesburg

You shall hear it said Keogh I said my instincts of narrative
were perplexed Dont you believe it Its an art Ive acquired along
with many other of the graces and sciences




VI

THE PHONOGRAPH AND THE GRAFT


What was this graft asked Johnny with the impatience of the great
public to whom tales are told

Tis contrary to art and philosophy to give you the information
said Keogh calmly The art of narrative consists in concealing from
your audience everything it wants to know until after you expose your
favourite opinions on topics foreign to the subject A good story is
like a bitter pill with the sugar coating inside of it I will begin
if you please with a horoscope located in the Cherokee Nation and
end with a moral tune on the phonograph

Me and Henry Horsecollar brought the first phonograph to this
country Henry was a quarterbreed quarterback Cherokee educated
East in the idioms of football and West in contraband whisky and
a gentleman the same as you and me He was easy and romping in his
ways a man about six foot with a kind of rubbertire movement Yes
he was a little man about five foot five or five foot eleven He was
what you would call a medium tall man of average smallness Henry had
quit college once and the Muscogee jail three timesthe lastnamed
institution on account of introducing and selling whisky in the
territories Henry Horsecollar never let any cigar stores come up and
stand behind him He didnt belong to that tribe of Indians

Henry and me met at Texarkana and figured out this phonograph
scheme He had 360 which came to him out of a land allotment in
the reservation I had run down from Little Rock on account of a
distressful scene I had witnessed on the street there A man stood on
a box and passed around some gold watches screw case stemwinders
Elgin movement very elegant Twenty bucks they cost you over the
counter At three dollars the crowd fought for the tickers The man
happened to find a valise full of them handy and he passed them out
like putting hot biscuits on a plate The backs were hard to unscrew
but the crowd put its ear to the case and they ticked mollifying and
agreeable Three of these watches were genuine tickers the rest were
only kickers Hey Why empty cases with one of them horny black bugs
that fly around electric lights in em Them bugs kick off minutes
and seconds industrious and beautiful So this man I was speaking
of cleaned up 288 and then he went away because he knew that when
it came time to wind watches in Little Rock an entomologist would be
needed and he wasnt one

So as I say Henry had 360 and I had 288 The idea of
introducing the phonograph to South America was Henrys but I took
to it freely being fond of machinery of all kinds

The Latin races says Henry explaining easy in the idioms he
learned at college are peculiarly adapted to be victims of the
phonograph They have the artistic temperament They yearn for music
and color and gaiety They give wampum to the handorgan man and the
fourlegged chicken in the tent when theyre months behind with the
grocery and the breadfruit tree

Then says I well export canned music to the Latins but Im
mindful of Mr Julius Caesars account of em where he says _Omnia
Gallia in tres partes divisa est_ which is the same as to say We
will need all of our gall in devising means to tree them parties

I hated to make a show of education but I was disinclined to be
overdone in syntax by a mere Indian a member of a race to which we
owe nothing except the land on which the United States is situated

We bought a fine phonograph in Texarkanaone of the best makeand
half a trunkful of records We packed up and took the T and
P for New Orleans From that celebrated centre of molasses and
disfranchised coon songs we took a steamer for South America

We landed at Solitas forty miles up the coast from here Twas a
palatable enough place to look at The houses were clean and white
and to look at em stuck around among the scenery they reminded
you of hardboiled eggs served with lettuce There was a block of
skyscraper mountains in the suburbs and they kept pretty quiet like
they had crept up there and were watching the town And the sea was
remarking Shshsh on the beach and now and then a ripe cocoanut
would drop kerblip in the sand and that was all there was doing
Yes I judge that town was considerably on the quiet I judge that
after Gabriel quits blowing his horn and the car starts with
Philadelphia swinging to the last strap and Pine Gully Arkansas
hanging onto the rear step this town of Solitas will wake up and ask
if anybody spoke

The captain went ashore with us and offered to conduct what he
seemed to like to call the obsequies He introduced Henry and me to
the United States Consul and a roan man the head of the Department
of Mercenary and Licentious Dispositions the way it read upon his
sign

I touch here again a week from today says the captain

By that time we told him well be amassing wealth in the
interior towns with our galvanized prima donna and correct imitations
of Sousas band excavating a march from a tin mine

Yell not says the captain Yell be hypnotized Any gentleman
in the audience who kindly steps upon the stage and looks this
country in the eye will be converted to the hypothesis that hes but
a fly in the Elgin creamery Yell be standing knee deep in the surf
waiting for me and your machine for making Hamburger steak out of
the hitherto respected art of music will be playing Theres no place
like home

Henry skinned a twenty off his roll and received from the Bureau
of Mercenary Dispositions a paper bearing a red seal and a dialect
story and no change

Then we got the consul full of red wine and struck him for a
horoscope He was a thin youngish kind of man I should say past
fifty sort of FrenchIrish in his affections and puffed up with
disconsolation Yes he was a flattened kind of a man in whom drink
lay stagnant inclined to corpulence and misery Yes I think he was
a kind of Dutchman being very sad and genial in his ways

The marvelous invention he says entitled the phonograph has
never invaded these shores The people have never heard it They
would not believe it if they should Simplehearted children of
nature progress has never condemned them to accept the work of a
canopener as an overture and ragtime might incite them to a bloody
revolution But you can try the experiment The best chance you have
is that the populace may not wake up when you play Theres two
ways says the consul they may take it They may become inebriated
with attention like an Atlanta colonel listening to Marching
Through Georgia or they will get excited and transpose the key of
the music with an axe and yourselves into a dungeon In the latter
case says the consul Ill do my duty by cabling to the State
Department and Ill wrap the Stars and Stripes around you when you
come to be shot and threaten them with the vengeance of the greatest
gold export and financial reserve nation on earth The flag is
full of bullet holes now says the consul made in that way
Twice before says the consul I have cabled our government for a
couple of gunboats to protect American citizens The first time the
Department sent me a pair of gum boots The other time was when a man
named Pease was going to be executed here They referred that appeal
to the Secretary of Agriculture Let us now disturb the senor behind
the bar for a subsequence of the red wine

Thus soliloquized the consul of Solitas to me and Henry Horsecollar

But notwithstanding we hired a room that afternoon in the Calle de
los Angeles the main street that runs along the shore and put our
trunks there Twas a goodsized room dark and cheerful but small
Twas on a various street diversified by houses and conservatory
plants The peasantry of the city passed to and fro on the fine
pasturage between the sidewalks Twas for the world like an opera
chorus when the Royal Kafoozlum is about to enter

We were rubbing the dust off the machine and getting fixed to
start business the next day when a big finelooking white man in
white clothes stopped at the door and looked in We extended the
invitations and he walked inside and sized us up He was chewing a
long cigar and wrinkling his eyes meditative like a girl trying to
decide which dress to wear to the party

New York he says to me finally

Originally and from time to time I says Hasnt it rubbed off
yet

Its simple says he when you know how Its the fit of the
vest They dont cut vests right anywhere else Coats maybe but not
vests

The white man looks at Henry Horsecollar and hesitates

Injun says Henry tame Injun

Mellinger says the manHomer P Mellinger Boys youre
confiscated Youre babes in the wood without a chaperon or referee
and its my duty to start you going Ill knock out the props and
launch you proper in the pellucid waters of this tropical mud puddle
Youll have to be christened and if youll come with me Ill break a
bottle of wine across your bows according to Hoyle

Well for two days Homer P Mellinger did the honors That man cut
ice in Anchuria He was It He was the Royal Kafoozlum If me and
Henry was babes in the wood he was a Robin Redbreast from the
topmost bough Him and me and Henry Horsecollar locked arms and
toted that phonograph around and had wassail and diversions
Everywhere we found doors open we went inside and set the machine
going and Mellinger called upon the people to observe the artful
music and his two lifelong friends the Senors Americanos The opera
chorus was agitated with esteem and followed us from house to house
There was a different kind of drink to be had with every tune The
natives had acquirements of a pleasant thing in the way of a drink
that gums itself to the recollection They chop off the end of a
green cocoanut and pour in on the juice of it French brandy and
other adjuvants We had them and other things

Mine and Henrys money was counterfeit Everything was on Homer P
Mellinger That man could find rolls of bills concealed in places
on his person where Hermann the Wizard couldnt have conjured out a
rabbit or an omelette He could have founded universities and made
orchid collections and then had enough left to purchase the colored
vote of his country Henry and me wondered what his graft was One
evening he told us

Boys said he Ive deceived you You think Im a painted
butterfly but in fact Im the hardest worked man in this country
Ten years ago I landed on its shores and two years ago on the point
of its jaw Yes I guess I can get the decision over this ginger cake
commonwealth at the end of any round I choose Ill confide in you
because you are my countrymen and guests even if you have assaulted
my adopted shores with the worst system of noises ever set to music

My job is private secretary to the president of this republic and
my duties are running it Im not headlined in the bills but Im the
mustard in the salad dressing just the same There isnt a law goes
before Congress there isnt a concession granted there isnt an
import duty levied but what H P Mellinger he cooks and seasons
it In the front office I fill the presidents inkstand and search
visiting statesmen for dirks and dynamite but in the back room I
dictate the policy of the government Youd never guess in the world
how I got my pull Its the only graft of its kind on earth Ill put
you wise You remember the old topliner in the copy bookHonesty
is the Best Policy Thats it Im working honesty for a graft Im
the only honest man in the republic The government knows it the
people know it the boodlers know it the foreign investors know it
I make the government keep its faith If a man is promised a job he
gets it If outside capital buys a concession it gets the goods I
run a monopoly of square dealing here Theres no competition If
Colonel Diogenes were to flash his lantern in this precinct hed have
my address inside of two minutes There isnt big money in it but
its a sure thing and lets a man sleep of nights

Thus Homer P Mellinger made oration to me and Henry Horsecollar
And later he divested himself of this remark

Boys Im to hold a _soiree_ this evening with a gang of leading
citizens and I want your assistance You bring the musical corn
sheller and give the affair the outside appearance of a function
Theres important business on hand but it mustnt show I can talk
to you people Ive been pained for years on account of not having
anybody to blow off and brag to I get homesick sometimes and Id
swap the entire perquisites of office for just one hour to have a
stein and a caviare sandwich somewhere on Thirtyfourth Street and
stand and watch the street cars go by and smell the peanut roaster
at old Giuseppes fruit stand

Yes said I theres fine caviare at Billy Renfrews cafe corner
of Thirtyfourth and

God knows it interrupts Mellinger and if youd told me you knew
Billy Renfrew Id have invented tons of ways of making you happy
Billy was my sidekicker in New York There is a man who never knew
what crooked was Here I am working Honesty for a graft but that man
loses money on it Carrambos I get sick at times of this country
Everythings rotten From the executive down to the coffee pickers
theyre plotting to down each other and skin their friends If a mule
driver takes off his hat to an official that man figures it out that
hes a popular idol and sets his pegs to stir up a revolution and
upset the administration Its one of my little chores as private
secretary to smell out these revolutions and affix the kibosh before
they break out and scratch the paint off the government property
Thats why Im down here now in this mildewed coast town The
governor of the district and his crew are plotting to uprise Ive
got every one of their names and theyre invited to listen to the
phonograph tonight compliments of H P M Thats the way Ill get
them in a bunch and things are on the programme to happen to them

We three were sitting at table in the cantina of the Purified
Saints Mellinger poured out wine and was looking some worried I
was thinking

Theyre a sharp crowd he says kind of fretful Theyre
capitalized by a foreign syndicate after rubber and theyre loaded
to the muzzle for bribing Im sick goes on Mellinger of comic
opera I want to smell East River and wear suspenders again At times
I feel like throwing up my job but Im dn fool enough to be sort
of proud of it Theres Mellinger they say here _Por Dios_ you
cant touch him with a million Id like to take that record back
and show it to Billy Renfrew some day and that tightens my grip
whenever I see a fat thing that I could corral just by winking one
eyeand losing my graft By  they cant monkey with me They
know it What money I get I make honest and spend it Some day Ill
make a pile and go back and eat caviare with Billy Tonight Ill
show you how to handle a bunch of corruptionists Ill show them what
Mellinger private secretary means when you spell it with the cotton
and tissue paper off

Mellinger appears shaky and breaks his glass against the neck of
the bottle

I says to myself White man if Im not mistaken theres been a
bait laid out where the tail of your eye could see it

That night according to arrangements me and Henry took the
phonograph to a room in a dobe house in a dirty side street where
the grass was knee high Twas a long room lit with smoky oil lamps
There was plenty of chairs and a table at the back end We set the
phonograph on the table Mellinger was there walking up and down
disturbed in his predicaments He chewed cigars and spat em out and
he bit the thumb nail of his left hand

By and by the invitations to the musicale came sliding in by pairs
and threes and spade flushes Their colour was of a diversity
running from a threedays smoked meerschaum to a patentleather
polish They were as polite as wax being devastated with enjoyments
to give Senor Mellinger the good evenings I understood their Spanish
talkI ran a pumping engine two years in a Mexican silver mine and
had it patbut I never let on

Maybe fifty of em had come and was seated when in slid the king
bee the governor of the district Mellinger met him at the door and
escorted him to the grand stand When I saw that Latin man I knew
that Mellinger private secretary had all the dances on his card
taken That was a big squashy man the colour of a rubber overshoe
and he had an eye like a head waiters

Mellinger explained fluent in the Castilian idioms that his soul
was disconcerted with joy at introducing to his respected friends
Americas greatest invention the wonder of the age Henry got the
cue and run on an elegant brassband record and the festivities
became initiated The governor man had a bit of English under his
hat and when the music was choked off he says

Verrree fine _Grrrrracias_ the American gentleemen the so
esplendeed moosic as to playee

The table was a long one and Henry and me sat at the end of it next
the wall The governor sat at the other end Homer P Mellinger stood
at the side of it I was just wondering how Mellinger was going to
handle his crowd when the home talent suddenly opened the services

That governor man was suitable for uprisings and policies I judge
he was a ready kind of man who took his own time Yes he was full
of attention and immediateness He leaned his hands on the table and
imposed his face toward the secretary man

Do the American senors understand Spanish he asks in his native
accents

They do not says Mellinger

Then listen goes on the Latin man prompt The musics are
of sufficient prettiness but not of necessity Let us speak
of business I well know why we are here since I observe my
compatriots You had a whisper yesterday Senor Mellinger of our
proposals Tonight we will speak out We know that you stand in
the presidents favour and we know your influence The government
will be changed We know the worth of your services We esteem your
friendship and aid so much thatMellinger raises his hand but the
governor man bottles him up Do not speak until I have done

The governor man then draws a package wrapped in paper from his
pocket and lays it on the table by Mellingers hand

In that you will find fifty thousand dollars in money of your
country You can do nothing against us but you can be worth that for
us Go back to the capital and obey our instructions Take that money
now We trust you You will find with it a paper giving in detail the
work you will be expected to do for us Do not have the unwiseness to
refuse

The governor man paused with his eyes fixed on Mellinger full of
expressions and observances I looked at Mellinger and was glad
Billy Renfrew couldnt see him then The sweat was popping out on his
forehead and he stood dumb tapping the little package with the ends
of his fingers The coloradomaduro gang was after his graft He had
only to change his politics and stuff five fingers in his inside
pocket

Henry whispers to me and wants the pause in the programme
interpreted I whisper back H P is up against a bribe senators
size and the coons have got him going I saw Mellingers hand
moving closer to the package Hes weakening I whispered to
Henry Well remind him says Henry of the peanutroaster on
Thirtyfourth Street New York

Henry stooped down and got a record from the basketful wed brought
slid it in the phonograph and started her off It was a cornet solo
very neat and beautiful and the name of it was Home Sweet Home
Not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing
and the governor man kept his eyes steady on Mellinger I saw
Mellingers head go up little by little and his hand came creeping
away from the package Not until the last note sounded did anybody
stir And then Homer P Mellinger takes up the bundle of boodle and
slams it in the governor mans face

Thats my answer says Mellinger private secretary and therell
be another in the morning I have proofs of conspiracy against every
man of you The show is over gentlemen

Theres one more act puts in the governor man You are a
servant I believe employed by the president to copy letters and
answer raps at the door I am governor here _Senores_ I call upon
you in the name of the cause to seize this man

That brindled gang of conspirators shoved back their chairs and
advanced in force I could see where Mellinger had made a mistake in
massing his enemy so as to make a grandstand play I think he made
another one too but we can pass that Mellingers idea of a graft
and mine being different according to estimations and points of
view

There was only one window and door in that room and they were in
the front end Here was fifty odd Latin men coming in a bunch to
obstruct the legislation of Mellinger You may say there were three
of us for me and Henry simultaneous declared New York City and the
Cherokee Nation in sympathy with the weaker party

Then it was that Henry Horsecollar rose to a point of disorder
and intervened showing admirable the advantages of education
as applied to the American Indians natural intellect and native
refinement He stood up and smoothed back his hair on each side with
his hands as you have seen little girls do when they play

Get behind me both of you says Henry

Whats it to be chief I asked

Im going to buck centre says Henry in his football idioms
There isnt a tackle in the lot of them Follow me close and rush
the game

Then that cultured Red Man exhaled an arrangement of sounds with
his mouth that made the Latin aggregation pause with thoughtfulness
and hesitations The matter of his proclamation seemed to be a
cooperation of the Carlisle warwhoop with the Cherokee college
yell He went at the chocolate team like a bean out of a little boys
nigger shooter His right elbow laid out the governor man on the
gridiron and he made a lane the length of the crowd so wide that a
woman could have carried a stepladder through it without striking
against anything All Mellinger and me had to do was to follow

It took us just three minutes to get out of that street around to
military headquarters where Mellinger had things his own way A
colonel and a battalion of baretoed infantry turned out and went
back to the scene of the musicale with us but the conspirator gang
was gone But we recaptured the phonograph with honours of war and
marched back to the _cuartel_ with it playing All Coons Look Alike
to Me

The next day Mellinger takes me and Henry to one side and begins to
shed tens and twenties

I want to buy that phonograph says he I liked that last tune it
played at the _soiree_

This is more money than the machine is worth says I

Tis government expense money says Mellinger The government
pays for it and its getting the tunegrinder cheap

Me and Henry knew that pretty well We knew that it had saved Homer
P Mellingers graft when he was on the point of losing it but we
never let him know we knew it

Now you boys better slide off further down the coast for a while
says Mellinger till I get the screws put on these fellows here If
you dont theyll give you trouble And if you ever happen to see
Billy Renfrew again before I do tell him Im coming back to New York
as soon as I can make a stakehonest

Me and Henry laid low until the day the steamer came back When we
saw the captains boat on the beach we went down and stood in the
edge of the water The captain grinned when he saw us

I told you youd be waiting he says Wheres the Hamburger
machine

It stays behind I says to play Home Sweet Home

I told you so says the captain again Climb in the boat

And that said Keogh is the way me and Henry Horsecollar
introduced the phonograph into this country Henry went back to the
States but Ive been rummaging around in the tropics ever since
They say Mellinger never travelled a mile after that without his
phonograph I guess it kept him reminded about his graft whenever he
saw the siren voice of the boodler tip him the wink with a bribe in
its hand

I suppose hes taking it home with him as a souvenir remarked the
consul

Not as a souvenir said Keogh Hell need two of em in New York
running day and night




VII

MONEY MAZE


The new administration of Anchuria entered upon its duties and
privileges with enthusiasm Its first act was to send an agent to
Coralio with imperative orders to recover if possible the sum of
money ravished from the treasury by the illfated Miraflores

Colonel Emilio Falcon the private secretary of Losada the new
president was despatched from the capital upon this important
mission

The position of private secretary to a tropical president is a
responsible one He must be a diplomat a spy a ruler of men a
bodyguard to his chief and a smellerout of plots and nascent
revolutions Often he is the power behind the throne the dictator of
policy and a president chooses him with a dozen times the care with
which he selects a matrimonial mate

Colonel Falcon a handsome and urbane gentleman of Castilian courtesy
and debonnaire manners came to Coralio with the task before him of
striking upon the cold trail of the lost money There he conferred
with the military authorities who had received instructions to
cooperate with him in the search

Colonel Falcon established his headquarters in one of the rooms of
the Casa Morena Here for a week he held informal sittingsmuch as
if he were a kind of unified grand juryand summoned before him all
those whose testimony might illumine the financial tragedy that had
accompanied the less momentous one of the late presidents death

Two or three who were thus examined among whom was the barber
Esteban declared that they had identified the body of the president
before its burial

Of a truth testified Esteban before the mighty secretary it was
he the president Considerhow could I shave a man and not see his
face He sent for me to shave him in a small house He had a beard
very black and thick Had I ever seen the president before Why not
I saw him once ride forth in a carriage from the _vapor_ in Solitas
When I shaved him he gave me a gold piece and said there was to be
no talk But I am a LiberalI am devoted to my countryand I spake
of these things to Senor Goodwin

It is known said Colonel Falcon smoothly that the late
President took with him an American leather valise containing a
large amount of money Did you see that

_De veras_no Esteban answered The light in the little house
was but a small lamp by which I could scarcely see to shave the
President Such a thing there may have been but I did not see
it No Also in the room was a young ladya senorita of much
beautythat I could see even in so small a light But the money
senor or the thing in which it was carriedthat I did not see

The _comandante_ and other officers gave testimony that they had been
awakened and alarmed by the noise of a pistolshot in the Hotel de
los Estranjeros Hurrying thither to protect the peace and dignity of
the republic they found a man lying dead with a pistol clutched in
his hand Beside him was a young woman weeping sorely Senor Goodwin
was also in the room when they entered it But of the valise of money
they saw nothing

Madame Timotea Ortiz the proprietress of the hotel in which the game
of FoxintheMorning had been played out told of the coming of the
two guests to her house

To my house they came said sheone _senor_ not quite old and
one _senorita_ of sufficient handsomeness They desired not to eat or
to drinknot even of my _aguardiente_ which is the best To their
rooms they ascended_Numero Nueve_ and _Numero Diez_ Later came
Senor Goodwin who ascended to speak with them Then I heard a
great noise like that of a _canon_ and they said that the _pobre
Presidente_ had shot himself _Esta bueno_ I saw nothing of money or
of the thing you call _veliz_ that you say he carried it in

Colonel Falcon soon came to the reasonable conclusion that if anyone
in Coralio could furnish a clue to the vanished money Frank Goodwin
must be the man But the wise secretary pursued a different course in
seeking information from the American Goodwin was a powerful friend
to the new administration and one who was not to be carelessly
dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage Even the
private secretary of His Excellency hesitated to have this rubber
prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of
Anchuria So he sent Goodwin a flowery epistle each wordpetal
dripping with honey requesting the favour of an interview Goodwin
replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house

Before the hour named the American walked over to the Casa Morena
and greeted his guest frankly and friendly Then the two strolled in
the cool of the afternoon to Goodwins home in the environs

The American left Colonel Falcon in a big cool shadowed room with a
floor of inlaid and polished woods that any millionaire in the States
would have envied excusing himself for a few minutes He crossed a
_patio_ shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants and entered
a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house
The broad jalousies were opened wide and the ocean breeze flowed
in through the room an invisible current of coolness and health
Goodwins wife sat near one of the windows making a watercolor
sketch of the afternoon seascape

Here was a woman who looked to be happy And moreshe looked to be
content Had a poet been inspired to pen just similes concerning
her favour he would have likened her full clear eyes with their
whiteencircled gray irises to moonflowers With none of the
goddesses whose traditional charms have become coldly classic
would the discerning rhymester have compared her She was purely
Paradisaic not Olympian If you can imagine Eve after the eviction
beguiling the flaming warriors and serenely reentering the Garden
you will have her Just so human and still so harmonious with Eden
seemed Mrs Goodwin

When her husband entered she looked up and her lips curved and
parted her eyelids fluttered twice or thricea movement remindful
Poesy forgive us of the tailwagging of a faithful dogand a
little ripple went through her like the commotion set up in a weeping
willow by a puff of wind Thus she ever acknowledged his coming were
it twenty times a day If they who sometimes sat over their wine
in Coralio reshaping old diverting stories of the madcap career
of Isabel Guilbert could have seen the wife of Frank Goodwin that
afternoon in the estimable aura of her happy wifehood they might
have disbelieved or have agreed to forget those graphic annals of
the life of the one for whom their president gave up his country and
his honour

I have brought a guest to dinner said Goodwin One Colonel
Falcon from San Mateo He is come on government business I do not
think you will care to see him so I prescribe for you one of those
convenient and indisputable feminine headaches

He has come to inquire about the lost money has he not asked Mrs
Goodwin going on with her sketch

A good guess acknowledged Goodwin He has been holding an
inquisition among the natives for three days I am next on his list
of witnesses but as he feels shy about dragging one of Uncle Sams
subjects before him he consents to give it the outward appearance
of a social function He will apply the torture over my own wine and
provender

Has he found anyone who saw the valise of money

Not a soul Even Madama Ortiz whose eyes are so sharp for the sight
of a revenue official does not remember that there was any baggage

Mrs Goodwin laid down her brush and sighed

I am so sorry Frank she said that they are giving you so much
trouble about the money But we cant let them know about it can
we

Not without doing our intelligence a great injustice said Goodwin
with a smile and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives
_Americano_ though I am they would have me in the _calaboza_ in
half an hour if they knew we had appropriated that valise No we
must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in
Coralio

Do you think that this man they have sent suspects you she asked
with a little pucker of her brows

Hed better not said the American carelessly Its lucky that no
one caught a sight of the valise except myself As I was in the rooms
when the shot was fired it is not surprising that they should want
to investigate my part in the affair rather closely But theres no
cause for alarm This colonel is down on the list of events for a
good dinner with a dessert of American bluff that will end the
matter I think

Mrs Goodwin rose and walked to the window Goodwin followed and
stood by her side She leaned to him and rested in the protection of
his strength as she had always rested since that dark night on which
he had first made himself her tower of refuge Thus they stood for a
little while

Straight through the lavish growth of tropical branch and leaf
and vine that confronted them had been cunningly trimmed a vista
that ended at the cleared environs of Coralio on the banks of the
mangrove swamp At the other end of the aerial tunnel they could see
the grave and wooden headpiece that bore the name of the unhappy
President Miraflores From this window when the rains forbade the
open and from the green and shady slopes of Goodwins fruitful
lands when the skies were smiling his wife was wont to look upon
that grave with a gentle sadness that was now scarcely a mar to her
happiness

I loved him so Frank she said even after that terrible flight
and its awful ending And you have been so good to me and have made
me so happy It has all grown into such a strange puzzle If they
were to find out that we got the money do you think they would force
you to make the amount good to the government

They would undoubtedly try answered Goodwin You are right about
its being a puzzle And it must remain a puzzle to Falcon and all
his countrymen until it solves itself You and I who know more than
anyone else only know half of the solution We must not let even a
hint about this money get abroad Let them come to the theory that
the president concealed it in the mountains during his journey or
that he found means to ship it out of the country before he reached
Coralio I dont think that Falcon suspects me He is making a close
investigation according to his orders but he will find out
nothing

Thus they spake together Had anyone overheard or overseen them as
they discussed the lost funds of Anchuria there would have been a
second puzzle presented For upon the faces and in the bearing of
each of them was visible if countenances are to be believed Saxon
honesty and pride and honourable thoughts In Goodwins steady eye
and firm lineaments moulded into material shape by the inward
spirit of kindness and generosity and courage there was nothing
reconcilable with his words

As for his wife physiognomy championed her even in the face of their
accusive talk Nobility was in her guise purity was in her glance
The devotion that she manifested had not even the appearance of that
feeling that now and then inspires a woman to share the guilt of her
partner out of the pathetic greatness of her love No there was a
discrepancy here between what the eye would have seen and the ear
have heard

Dinner was served to Goodwin and his guest in the _patio_ under cool
foliage and flowers The American begged the illustrious secretary to
excuse the absence of Mrs Goodwin who was suffering he said from
a headache brought on by a slight _calentura_

After the meal they lingered according to the custom over their
coffee and cigars Colonel Falcon with true Castilian delicacy
waited for his host to open the question that they had met to
discuss He had not long to wait As soon as the cigars were lighted
the American cleared the way by inquiring whether the secretarys
investigations in the town had furnished him with any clue to the
lost funds

I have found no one yet admitted Colonel Falcon who even had
sight of the valise or the money Yet I have persisted It has been
proven in the capital that President Miraflores set out from San
Mateo with one hundred thousand dollars belonging to the government
accompanied by _Senorita_ Isabel Guilbert the opera singer The
Government officially and personally is loathe to believe
concluded Colonel Falcon with a smile that our late Presidents
tastes would have permitted him to abandon on the route as excess
baggage either of the desirable articles with which his flight was
burdened

I suppose you would like to hear what I have to say about the
affair said Goodwin coming directly to the point It will not
require many words

On that night with others of our friends here I was keeping a
lookout for the president having been notified of his flight by a
telegram in our national cipher from Englehart one of our leaders
in the capital About ten oclock that night I saw a man and a
woman hurrying along the streets They went to the Hotel de los
Estranjeros and engaged rooms I followed them upstairs leaving
Esteban who had come up to watch outside The barber had told me
that he had shaved the beard from the presidents face that night
therefore I was prepared when I entered the rooms to find him with
a smooth face When I apprehended him in the name of the people he
drew a pistol and shot himself instantly In a few minutes many
officers and citizens were on the spot I suppose you have been
informed of the subsequent facts

Goodwin paused Losadas agent maintained an attitude of waiting as
if he expected a continuance

And now went on the American looking steadily into the eyes of
the other man and giving each word a deliberate emphasis you will
oblige me by attending carefully to what I have to add I saw no
valise or receptacle of any kind or any money belonging to the
Republic of Anchuria If President Miraflores decamped with any funds
belonging to the treasury of this country or to himself or to
anyone else I saw no trace of it in the house or elsewhere at that
time or at any other Does that statement cover the ground of the
inquiry you wished to make of me

Colonel Falcon bowed and described a fluent curve with his cigar
His duty was performed Goodwin was not to be disputed He was a
loyal supporter of the government and enjoyed the full confidence
of the new president His rectitude had been the capital that had
brought him fortune in Anchuria just as it had formed the lucrative
graft of Mellinger the secretary of Miraflores

I thank you _Senor_ Goodwin said Falcon for speaking plainly
Your word will be sufficient for the president But _Senor_ Goodwin
I am instructed to pursue every clue that presents itself in this
matter There is one that I have not yet touched upon Our friends
in France _senor_ have a saying _Cherchez la femme_ when there
is a mystery without a clue But here we do not have to search The
woman who accompanied the late President in his flight must surely

I must interrupt you there interposed Goodwin It is true that
when I entered the hotel for the purpose of intercepting President
Miraflores I found a lady there I must beg of you to remember that
that lady is now my wife I speak for her as I do for myself She
knows nothing of the fate of the valise or of the money that you
are seeking You will say to his excellency that I guarantee her
innocence I do not need to add to you Colonel Falcon that I do not
care to have her questioned or disturbed

Colonel Falcon bowed again

_Por supuesto_ no he cried And to indicate that the inquiry was
ended he added And now _senor_ let me beg of you to show me that
sea view from your _galeria_ of which you spoke I am a lover of the
sea

In the early evening Goodwin walked back to the town with his guest
leaving him at the corner of the Calle Grande As he was returning
homeward one Beelzebub Blythe with the air of a courtier and the
outward aspect of a scarecrow pounced upon him hopefully from the
door of a _pulperia_

Blythe had been rechristened Beelzebub as an acknowledgment of the
greatness of his fall Once in some distant Paradise Lost he had
foregathered with the angels of the earth But Fate had hurled him
headlong down to the tropics where flamed in his bosom a fire that
was seldom quenched In Coralio they called him a beachcomber but he
was in reality a categorical idealist who strove to anamorphosize
the dull verities of life by the means of brandy and rum As
Beelzebub himself might have held in his clutch with unwitting
tenacity his harp or crown during his tremendous fall so his
namesake had clung to his goldrimmed eyeglasses as the only souvenir
of his lost estate These he wore with impressiveness and distinction
while he combed beaches and extracted toll from his friends By some
mysterious means he kept his drinkreddened face always smoothly
shaven For the rest he sponged gracefully upon whomsoever he could
for enough to keep him pretty drunk and sheltered from the rains and
night dews

Hallo Goodwin called the derelict airily I was hoping Id
strike you I wanted to see you particularly Suppose we go where we
can talk Of course you know theres a chap down here looking up the
money old Miraflores lost

Yes said Goodwin Ive been talking with him Lets go into
Espadas place I can spare you ten minutes

They went into the _pulperia_ and sat at a little table upon stools
with rawhide tops

Have a drink said Goodwin

They cant bring it too quickly said Blythe Ive been in a
drought ever since morning Hi_muchachoel aguardiente por aca_

Now what do you want to see me about asked Goodwin when the
drinks were before them

Confound it old man drawled Blythe why do you spoil a golden
moment like this with business I wanted to see youwell this has
the preference He gulped down his brandy and gazed longingly into
the empty glass

Have another suggested Goodwin

Between gentlemen said the fallen angel I dont quite like your
use of that word another It isnt quite delicate But the concrete
idea that the word represents is not displeasing

The glasses were refilled Blythe sipped blissfully from his as he
began to enter the state of a true idealist

I must trot along in a minute or two hinted Goodwin Was there
anything in particular

Blythe did not reply at once

Old Losada would make it a hot country he remarked at length
for the man who swiped that gripsack of treasury boodle dont you
think

Undoubtedly he would agreed Goodwin calmly as he rose leisurely
to his feet Ill be running over to the house now old man Mrs
Goodwin is alone There was nothing important you had to say was
there

Thats all said Blythe Unless you wouldnt mind sending in
another drink from the bar as you go out Old Espada has closed my
account to profit and loss And pay for the lot will you like a
good fellow

All right said Goodwin _Buenas noches_

Beelzebub Blythe lingered over his cups polishing his eyeglasses
with a disreputable handkerchief

I thought I could do it but I couldnt he muttered to himself
after a time A gentleman cant blackmail the man that he drinks
with




VIII

THE ADMIRAL


Spilled milk draws few tears from an Anchurian administration Many
are its lacteal sources and the clocks hands point forever to
milking time Even the rich cream skimmed from the treasury by the
bewitched Miraflores did not cause the newlyinstalled patriots to
waste time in unprofitable regrets The government philosophically
set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties
and by suggesting to wealthy private citizens that contributions
according to their means would be considered patriotic and in
order Prosperity was expected to attend the reign of Losada the
new president The ousted officeholders and military favourites
organized a new Liberal party and began to lay their plans for
a resuccession Thus the game of Anchurian politics began like a
Chinese comedy to unwind slowly its serial length Here and there
Mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid
lines

A dozen quarts of champagne in conjunction with an informal sitting
of the president and his cabinet led to the establishment of the navy
and the appointment of Felipe Carrera as its admiral

Next to the champagne the credit of the appointment belongs to Don
Sabas Placido the newly confirmed Minister of War

The president had requested a convention of his cabinet for the
discussion of questions politic and for the transaction of certain
routine matters of state The session had been signally tedious the
business and the wine prodigiously dry A sudden prankish humour of
Don Sabas impelling him to the deed spiced the grave affairs of
state with a whiff of agreeable playfulness

In the dilatory order of business had come a bulletin from the
coast department of Orilla del Mar reporting the seizure by the
customhouse officers at the town of Coralio of the sloop _Estrella
del Noche_ and her cargo of drygoods patent medicines granulated
sugar and threestar brandy Also six Martini rifles and a barrel of
American whisky Caught in the act of smuggling the sloop with its
cargo was now according to law the property of the republic

The Collector of Customs in making his report departed from the
conventional forms so far as to suggest that the confiscated vessel
be converted to the use of the government The prize was the first
capture to the credit of the department in ten years The collector
took opportunity to pat his department on the back

It often happened that government officers required transportation
from point to point along the coast and means were usually lacking
Furthermore the sloop could be manned by a loyal crew and employed
as a coast guard to discourage the pernicious art of smuggling The
collector also ventured to nominate one to whom the charge of the
boat could be safely intrusteda young man of Coralio Felipe
Carreranot be it understood one of extreme wisdom but loyal and
the best sailor along the coast

It was upon this hint that the Minister of War acted executing a
rare piece of drollery that so enlivened the tedium of executive
session

In the constitution of this small maritime banana republic was a
forgotten section that provided for the maintenance of a navy This
provisionwith many other wiser oneshad lain inert since the
establishment of the republic Anchuria had no navy and had no use
for one It was characteristic of Don Sabasa man at once merry
learned whimsical and audaciousthat he should have disturbed the
dust of this musty and sleeping statute to increase the humour of the
world by so much as a smile from his indulgent colleagues

With delightful mock seriousness the Minister of War proposed the
creation of a navy He argued its need and the glories it might
achieve with such gay and witty zeal that the travesty overcame with
its humour even the swart dignity of President Losada himself

The champagne was bubbling trickily in the veins of the mercurial
statesmen It was not the custom of the grave governors of Anchuria
to enliven their sessions with a beverage so apt to cast a veil of
disparagement over sober affairs The wine had been a thoughtful
compliment tendered by the agent of the Vesuvius Fruit Company as a
token of amicable relationsand certain consummated dealsbetween
that company and the republic of Anchuria

The jest was carried to its end A formidable official document was
prepared encrusted with chromatic seals and jaunty with fluttering
ribbons bearing the florid signatures of state This commission
conferred upon el Senor Don Felipe Carrera the title of Flag Admiral
of the Republic of Anchuria Thus within the space of a few minutes
and the dominion of a dozen extra dry the country took its place
among the naval powers of the world and Felipe Carrera became
entitled to a salute of nineteen guns whenever he might enter port

The southern races are lacking in that particular kind of humour
that finds entertainment in the defects and misfortunes bestowed by
Nature Owing to this defect in their constitution they are not moved
to laughter as are their northern brothers by the spectacle of the
deformed the feebleminded or the insane

Felipe Carrera was sent upon earth with but half his wits Therefore
the people of Coralio called him _El pobrecito loco_the poor
little crazed onesaying that God had sent but half of him to
earth retaining the other half

A sombre youth glowering and speaking only at the rarest times
Felipe was but negatively loco On shore he generally refused all
conversation He seemed to know that he was badly handicapped on
land where so many kinds of understanding are needed but on the
water his one talent set him equal with most men Few sailors whom
God had carefully and completely made could handle a sailboat as
well Five points nearer the wind than even the best of them he
could sail his sloop When the elements raged and set other men to
cowering the deficiencies of Felipe seemed of little importance
He was a perfect sailor if an imperfect man He owned no boat but
worked among the crews of the schooners and sloops that skimmed the
coast trading and freighting fruit out to the steamers where there
was no harbour It was through his famous skill and boldness on the
sea as well as for the pity felt for his mental imperfections that
he was recommended by the collector as a suitable custodian of the
captured sloop

When the outcome of Don Sabas little pleasantry arrived in the form
of the imposing and preposterous commission the collector smiled
He had not expected such prompt and overwhelming response to his
recommendation He despatched a _muchacho_ at once to fetch the
future admiral

The collector waited in his official quarters His office was in the
Calle Grande and the sea breezes hummed through its windows all day
The collector in white linen and canvas shoes philandered with
papers on an antique desk A parrot perched on a pen rack seasoned
the official tedium with a fire of choice Castilian imprecations Two
rooms opened into the collectors In one the clerical force of young
men of variegated complexions transacted with glitter and parade
their several duties Through the open door of the other room could
be seen a bronze babe guiltless of clothing that rollicked upon the
floor In a grass hammock a thin woman tinted a pale lemon played
a guitar and swung contentedly in the breeze Thus surrounded by
the routine of his high duties and the visible tokens of agreeable
domesticity the collectors heart was further made happy by the
power placed in his hands to brighten the fortunes of the innocent
Felipe

Felipe came and stood before the collector He was a lad of twenty
not illfavoured in looks but with an expression of distant and
pondering vacuity He wore white cotton trousers down the seams
of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military
decoration A flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat his feet
were bare he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the
States

Senor Carrera said the collector gravely producing the showy
commission I have sent for you at the presidents bidding This
document that I present to you confers upon you the title of Admiral
of this great republic and gives you absolute command of the naval
forces and fleet of our country You may think friend Felipe that
we have no navybut yes The sloop the _Estrella del Noche_ that my
brave men captured from the coast smugglers is to be placed under
your command The boat is to be devoted to the services of your
country You will be ready at all times to convey officials of the
government to points along the coast where they may be obliged to
visit You will also act as a coastguard to prevent as far as you
may be able the crime of smuggling You will uphold the honour and
prestige of your country at sea and endeavour to place Anchuria
among the proudest naval powers of the world These are your
instructions as the Minister of War desires me to convey them to you
_Por Dios_ I do not know how all this is to be accomplished for
not one word did his letter contain in respect to a crew or to the
expenses of this navy Perhaps you are to provide a crew yourself
Senor AdmiralI do not knowbut it is a very high honour that has
descended upon you I now hand you your commission When you are
ready for the boat I will give orders that she shall be made over
into your charge That is as far as my instructions go

Felipe took the commission that the collector handed to him He gazed
through the open window at the sea for a moment with his customary
expression of deep but vain pondering Then he turned without having
spoken a word and walked swiftly away through the hot sand of the
street

_Pobrecito loco_ sighed the collector and the parrot on the pen
racks screeched Locolocoloco

The next morning a strange procession filed through the streets to
the collectors office At its head was the admiral of the navy
Somewhere Felipe had raked together a pitiful semblance of a military
uniforma pair of red trousers a dingy blue short jacket heavily
ornamented with gold braid and an old fatigue cap that must have
been cast away by one of the British soldiers in Belize and brought
away by Felipe on one of his coasting voyages Buckled around his
waist was an ancient ships cutlass contributed to his equipment by
Pedro Lafitte the baker who proudly asserted its inheritance from
his ancestor the illustrious buccaneer At the admirals heels
tagged his newlyshipped crewthree grinning glossy black Caribs
bare to the waist the sand spurting in showers from the spring of
their naked feet

Briefly and with dignity Felipe demanded his vessel of the collector
And now a fresh honour awaited him The collectors wife who played
the guitar and read novels in the hammock all day had more than a
little romance in her placid yellow bosom She had found in an old
book an engraving of a flag that purported to be the naval flag of
Anchuria Perhaps it had so been designed by the founders of the
nation but as no navy had ever been established oblivion had
claimed the flag Laboriously with her own hands she had made a flag
after the patterna red cross upon a blueandwhite ground She
presented it to Felipe with these words Brave sailor this flag is
of your country Be true and defend it with your life Go you with
God

For the first time since his appointment the admiral showed a flicker
of emotion He took the silken emblem and passed his hand reverently
over its surface I am the admiral he said to the collectors
lady Being on land he could bring himself to no more exuberant
expression of sentiment At sea with the flag at the masthead of his
navy some more eloquent exposition of feelings might be forthcoming

Abruptly the admiral departed with his crew For the next three days
they were busy giving the _Estrella del Noche_ a new coat of white
paint trimmed with blue And then Felipe further adorned himself by
fastening a handful of brilliant parrots plumes in his cap Again he
tramped with his faithful crew to the collectors office and formally
notified him that the sloops name had been changed to _El Nacional_

During the next few months the navy had its troubles Even an admiral
is perplexed to know what to do without any orders But none came
Neither did any salaries _El Nacional_ swung idly at anchor

When Felipes little store of money was exhausted he went to the
collector and raised the question of finances

Salaries exclaimed the collector with hands raised _Valgame
Dios_ not one _centavo_ of my own pay have I received for the last
seven months The pay of an admiral do you ask _Quien sabe_ Should
it be less than three thousand _pesos_ _Mira_ you will see a
revolution in this country very soon A good sign of it is when the
government calls all the time for _pesos_ _pesos_ _pesos_ and pays
none out

Felipe left the collectors office with a look almost of content
on his sombre face A revolution would mean fighting and then the
government would need his services It was rather humiliating to be
an admiral without anything to do and have a hungry crew at your
heels begging for _reales_ to buy plantains and tobacco with

When he returned to where his happygolucky Caribs were waiting they
sprang up and saluted as he had drilled them to do

Come _muchachos_ said the admiral it seems that the government
is poor It has no money to give us We will earn what we need to
live upon Thus will we serve our country Soonhis heavy eyes
almost lighted upit may gladly call upon us for help

Thereafter _El Nacional_ turned out with the other coast craft and
became a wageearner She worked with the lighters freighting bananas
and oranges out to the fruit steamers that could not approach nearer
than a mile from the shore Surely a selfsupporting navy deserves
red letters in the budget of any nation

After earning enough at freighting to keep himself and his crew in
provisions for a week Felipe would anchor the navy and hang about
the little telegraph office looking like one of the chorus of an
insolvent comic opera troupe besieging the managers den A hope for
orders from the capital was always in his heart That his services as
admiral had never been called into requirement hurt his pride and
patriotism At every call he would inquire gravely and expectantly
for despatches The operator would pretend to make a search and then
reply

Not yet it seems _Senor el Almirantepoco tiempo_

Outside in the shade of the limetrees the crew chewed sugar cane or
slumbered well content to serve a country that was contented with so
little service

One day in the early summer the revolution predicted by the collector
flamed out suddenly It had long been smouldering At the first note
of alarm the admiral of the navy force and fleet made all sail for a
larger port on the coast of a neighbouring republic where he traded
a hastily collected cargo of fruit for its value in cartridges for
the five Martini rifles the only guns that the navy could boast
Then to the telegraph office sped the admiral Sprawling in his
favourite corner in his fastdecaying uniform with his prodigious
sabre distributed between his red legs he waited for the
longdelayed but now soon expected orders

Not yet _Senor el Almirante_ the telegraph clerk would call to
him_poco tiempo_

At the answer the admiral would plump himself down with a great
rattling of scabbard to await the infrequent tick of the little
instrument on the table

They will come would be his unshaken reply I am the admiral




IX

THE FLAG PARAMOUNT


At the head of the insurgent party appeared that Hector and learned
Theban of the southern republics Don Sabas Placido A traveller
a soldier a poet a scientist a statesman and a connoisseurthe
wonder was that he could content himself with the petty remote life
of his native country

It is a whim of Placidos said a friend who knew him well to
take up political intrigue It is not otherwise than as if he had
come upon a new _tempo_ in music a new bacillus in the air a new
scent or rhyme or explosive He will squeeze this revolution dry of
sensations and a week afterward will forget it skimming the seas
of the world in his brigantine to add to his already worldfamous
collections Collections of what _Por Dios_ of everything from
postage stamps to prehistoric stone idols

But for a mere dilettante the aesthetic Placido seemed to be
creating a lively row The people admired him they were fascinated
by his brilliancy and flattered by his taking an interest in so
small a thing as his native country They rallied to the call of his
lieutenants in the capital where somewhat contrary to arrangements
the army remained faithful to the government There was also lively
skirmishing in the coast towns It was rumoured that the revolution
was aided by the Vesuvius Fruit Company the power that forever
stood with chiding smile and uplifted finger to keep Anchuria in the
class of good children Two of its steamers the _Traveler_ and the
_Salvador_ were known to have conveyed insurgent troops from point
to point along the coast

As yet there had been no actual uprising in Coralio Military law
prevailed and the ferment was bottled for the time And then came
the word that everywhere the revolutionists were encountering defeat
In the capital the presidents forces triumphed and there was a
rumour that the leaders of the revolt had been forced to fly hotly
pursued

In the little telegraph office at Coralio there was always a
gathering of officials and loyal citizens awaiting news from the
seat of government One morning the telegraph key began clicking
and presently the operator called loudly One telegram for _el
Almirante_ Don Senor Felipe Carrera

There was a shuffling sound a great rattling of tin scabbard and
the admiral prompt at his spot of waiting leaped across the room to
receive it

The message was handed to him Slowly spelling it out he found it to
be his first official orderthus running


 Proceed immediately with your vessel to mouth of Rio Ruiz
 transport beef and provisions to barracks at Alforan

 Martinez General


Small glory to be sure in this his countrys first call But it
had called and joy surged in the admirals breast He drew his
cutlass belt to another buckle hole roused his dozing crew and in a
quarter of an hour _El Nacional_ was tacking swiftly down coast in a
stiff landward breeze

The Rio Ruiz is a small river emptying into the sea ten miles below
Coralio That portion of the coast is wild and solitary Through a
gorge in the Cordilleras rushes the Rio Ruiz cold and bubbling to
glide at last with breadth and leisure through an alluvial morass
into the sea

In two hours _El Nacional_ entered the rivers mouth The banks
were crowded with a disposition of formidable trees The sumptuous
undergrowth of the tropics overflowed the land and drowned itself in
the fallow waters Silently the sloop entered there and met a deeper
silence Brilliant with greens and ochres and floral scarlets the
umbrageous mouth of the Rio Ruiz furnished no sound or movement save
of the seagoing water as it purled against the prow of the vessel
Small chance there seemed of wresting beef or provisions from that
empty solitude

The admiral decided to cast anchor and at the chains rattle the
forest was stimulated to instant and resounding uproar The mouth of
the Rio Ruiz had only been taking a morning nap Parrots and baboons
screeched and barked in the trees a whirring and a hissing and a
booming marked the awakening of animal life a dark blue bulk was
visible for an instant as a startled tapir fought his way through
the vines

The navy under orders hung in the mouth of the little river for
hours The crew served the dinner of sharks fin soup plantains
crab gumbo and sour wine The admiral with a threefoot telescope
closely scanned the impervious foliage fifty yards away

It was nearly sunset when a reverberating hallooo came from the
forest to their left It was answered and three men mounted upon
mules crashed through the tropic tangle to within a dozen yards of
the rivers bank There they dismounted and one unbuckling his
belt struck each mule a violent blow with his sword scabbard so
that they with a fling of heels dashed back again into the forest

Those were strangelooking men to be conveying beef and provisions
One was a large and exceedingly active man of striking presence He
was of the purest Spanish type with curling graybesprinkled dark
hair blue sparkling eyes and the pronounced air of a _caballero
grande_ The other two were small brownfaced men wearing white
military uniforms high riding boots and swords The clothes of all
were drenched bespattered and rent by the thicket Some stress of
circumstance must have driven them _diable a quatre_ through flood
mire and jungle

_Ohe Senor Almirante_ called the large man Send to us your
boat

The dory was lowered and Felipe with one of the Caribs rowed
toward the left bank

The large man stood near the waters brink waist deep in the curling
vines As he gazed upon the scarecrow figure in the stern of the dory
a sprightly interest beamed upon his mobile face

Months of wageless and thankless service had dimmed the admirals
splendour His red trousers were patched and ragged Most of the
bright buttons and yellow braid were gone from his jacket The visor
of his cap was torn and depended almost to his eyes The admirals
feet were bare

Dear admiral cried the large man and his voice was like a blast
from a horn I kiss your hands I knew we could build upon your
fidelity You had our despatchfrom General Martinez A little
nearer with your boat dear Admiral Upon these devils of shifting
vines we stand with the smallest security

Felipe regarded him with a stolid face

Provisions and beef for the barracks at Alforan he quoted

No fault of the butchers _Almirante mio_ that the beef awaits you
not But you are come in time to save the cattle Get us aboard your
vessel senor at once You first _caballerosa priesa_ Come back
for me The boat is too small

The dory conveyed the two officers to the sloop and returned for the
large man

Have you so gross a thing as food good admiral he cried when
aboard And perhaps coffee Beef and provisions _Nombre de Dios_
a little longer and we could have eaten one of those mules that you
Colonel Rafael saluted so feelingly with your sword scabbard at
parting Let us have food and then we will sailfor the barracks at
Alforanno

The Caribs prepared a meal to which the three passengers of _El
Nacional_ set themselves with famished delight About sunset as was
its custom the breeze veered and swept back from the mountains cool
and steady bringing a taste of the stagnant lagoons and mangrove
swamps that guttered the lowlands The mainsail of the sloop was
hoisted and swelled to it and at that moment they heard shouts and a
waxing clamour from the bosky profundities of the shore

The butchers my dear admiral said the large man smiling too
late for the slaughter

Further than his orders to his crew the admiral was saying nothing
The topsail and jib were spread and the sloop glided out of the
estuary The large man and his companions had bestowed themselves
with what comfort they could about the bare deck Belike the thing
big in their minds had been their departure from that critical shore
and now that the hazard was so far reduced their thoughts were loosed
to the consideration of further deliverance But when they saw the
sloop turn and fly up coast again they relaxed satisfied with the
course the admiral had taken

The large man sat at ease his spirited blue eye engaged in the
contemplation of the navys commander He was trying to estimate this
sombre and fantastic lad whose impenetrable stolidity puzzled him
Himself a fugitive his life sought and chafing under the smart
of defeat and failure it was characteristic of him to transfer
instantly his interest to the study of a thing new to him It
was like him too to have conceived and risked all upon this
last desperate and madcap schemethis message to a poor crazed
_fanatico_ cruising about with his grotesque uniform and his farcical
title But his companions had been at their wits end escape had
seemed incredible and now he was pleased with the success of the
plan they had called crackbrained and precarious

The brief tropic twilight seemed to slide swiftly into the pearly
splendour of a moonlit night And now the lights of Coralio appeared
distributed against the darkening shore to their right The admiral
stood silent at the tiller the Caribs like black panthers held
the sheets leaping noiselessly at his short commands The three
passengers were watching intently the sea before them and when at
length they came in sight of the bulk of a steamer lying a mile out
from the town with her lights radiating deep into the water they
held a sudden voluble and closeheaded converse The sloop was
speeding as if to strike midway between ship and shore

The large man suddenly separated from his companions and approached
the scarecrow at the helm

My dear admiral he said the government has been exceedingly
remiss I feel all the shame for it that only its ignorance of your
devoted service has prevented it from sustaining An inexcusable
oversight has been made A vessel a uniform and a crew worthy of
your fidelity shall be furnished you But just now dear admiral
there is business of moment afoot The steamer lying there is the
_Salvador_ I and my friends desire to be conveyed to her where we
are sent on the governments business Do us the favour to shape your
course accordingly

Without replying the admiral gave a sharp command and put the
tiller hard to port _El Nacional_ swerved and headed straight as an
arrows course for the shore

Do me the favour said the large man a trifle restively to
acknowledge at least that you catch the sound of my words It
was possible that the fellow might be lacking in senses as well as
intellect

The admiral emitted a croaking harsh laugh and spake

They will stand you he said with your face to a wall and shoot
you dead That is the way they kill traitors I knew you when you
stepped into my boat I have seen your picture in a book You are
Sabas Placido traitor to your country With your face to a wall So
you will die I am the admiral and I will take you to them With
your face to a wall Yes

Don Sabas half turned and waved his hand with a ringing laugh
toward his fellow fugitives To you _caballeros_ I have related
the history of that session when we issued that O so ridiculous
commission Of a truth our jest has been turned against us Behold
the Frankensteins monster we have created

Don Sabas glanced toward the shore The lights of Coralio were
drawing near He could see the beach the warehouse of the _Bodega
Nacional_ the long low _cuartel_ occupied by the soldiers and
behind that gleaming in the moonlight a stretch of high adobe wall
He had seen men stood with their faces to that wall and shot dead

Again he addressed the extravagant figure at the helm

It is true he said that I am fleeing the country But receive
the assurance that I care very little for that Courts and camps
everywhere are open to Sabas Placido _Vaya_ what is this molehill
of a republicthis pigs head of a countryto a man like me I am a
_paisano_ of everywhere In Rome in London in Paris in Vienna you
will hear them say Welcome back Don Sabas Come_tonto_baboon
of a boyadmiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat Put us
on board the _Salvador_ and here is your payfive hundred _pesos_
in money of the _Estados Unidos_more than your lying government
will pay you in twenty years

Don Sabas pressed a plump purse against the youths hand The admiral
gave no heed to the words or the movement Braced against the helm
he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course His dull face
was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to
afford him joy and found utterance in another parrotlike cackle

That is why they do it he saidso that you will not see the
guns They fireoomand you fall dead With your face to the wall
Yes

The admiral called a sudden order to his crew The lithe silent
Caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway
into the hold of the sloop When the last one had disappeared Don
Sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened
the hatch and stood smiling

No rifles if you please dear admiral he said It was a whimsey
of mine once to compile a dictionary of the Carib _lengua_ So I
understood your order Perhaps now you will

He cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron
scraping along tin The admiral had drawn the cutlass of Pedro
Lafitte and was darting upon him The blade descended and it was
only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped
with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon He was drawing his
pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down

Don Sabas stooped over him and rose again

In the heart he said briefly _Senores_ the navy is abolished

Colonel Rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to
loose the mainsail sheets The boom swung round _El Nacional_ veered
and began to tack industriously for the _Salvador_

Strike that flag senor called Colonel Rafael Our friends on the
steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it

Well said cried Don Sabas Advancing to the mast he lowered the
flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter Thus ended the
Minister of Wars little piece of afterdinner drollery and by the
same hand that began it

Suddenly Don Sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting
deck to the side of Colonel Rafael Across his arm he carried the
flag of the extinguished navy

_Mire mire senor_ Ah _Dios_ Already can I hear that great bear
of an _Oestreicher_ shout _Du hast mein herz gebrochen Mire_
Of my friend Herr Grunitz of Vienna you have heard me relate
That man has travelled to Ceylon for an orchidto Patagonia for a
headdressto Benares for a slipperto Mozambique for a spearhead
to add to his famous collections Thou knowest also _amigo_ Rafael
that I have been a gatherer of curios My collection of battle flags
of the worlds navies was the most complete in existence until last
year Then Herr Grunitz secured two O such rare specimens One of a
Barbary state and one of the Makarooroos a tribe on the west coast
of Africa I have not those but they can be procured But this flag
senordo you know what it is Name of God do you know See that
red cross upon the blue and white ground You never saw it before
_Seguramente no_ It is the naval flag of your country _Mire_
This rotten tub we stand upon is its navythat dead cockatoo lying
there was its commanderthat stroke of cutlass and single pistol
shot a sea battle All a piece of absurd foolery I grant youbut
authentic There has never been another flag like this and there
never will be another No It is unique in the whole world Yes
Think of what that means to a collector of flags Do you know
_Coronel mio_ how many golden crowns Herr Grunitz would give for
this flag Ten thousand likely Well a hundred thousand would not
buy it Beautiful flag Only flag Little devil of a most heavenborn
flag _Ohe_ old grumbler beyond the ocean Wait till Don Sabas
comes again to the Koenigin Strasse He will let you kneel and touch
the folds of it with one finger _Ohe_ old spectacled ransacker of
the world

Forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the
gall of defeat Possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled
passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck
clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag He
snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east He shouted the
paean to his prize in trumpet tones as though he would make old
Grunitz hear in his musty den beyond the sea

They were waiting on the _Salvador_ to welcome them The sloop came
close alongside the steamer where her sides were sliced almost to the
lower deck for the loading of fruit The sailors of the _Salvador_
grappled and held her there

Captain McLeod leaned over the side

Well senor the jig is up Im told

The jig is up Don Sabas looked perplexed for a moment That
revolutionah yes With a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the
matter

The captain learned of the escape and the imprisoned crew

Caribs he said no harm in them He slipped down into the sloop
and kicked loose the hasp of the hatch The black fellows came
tumbling up sweating but grinning

Hey black boys said the captain in a dialect of his own you
sabe catchy boat and vamos back same place quick

They saw him point to themselves the sloop and Coralio Yas yas
they cried with broader grins and many nods

The fourDon Sabas the two officers and the captainmoved to quit
the sloop Don Sabas lagged a little behind looking at the still
form of the late admiral sprawled in his paltry trappings

_Pobrecito loco_ he said softly

He was a brilliant cosmopolite and a _cognoscente_ of high rank but
after all he was of the same race and blood and instinct as this
people Even as the simple _paisanos_ of Coralio had said it so said
Don Sabas Without a smile he looked and said The poor little
crazed one

Stooping he raised the limp shoulders drew the priceless and
induplicable flag under them and over the breast pinning it there
with the diamond star of the Order of San Carlos that he took from
the collar of his own coat

He followed after the others and stood with them upon the deck of
the _Salvador_ The sailors that steadied _El Nacional_ shoved her
off The jabbering Caribs hauled away at the rigging the sloop
headed for the shore

And Herr Grunitzs collection of naval flags was still the finest in
the world

THE SHAMROCK AND THE PALM


One night when there was no breeze and Coralio seemed closer than
ever to the gratings of Avernus five men were grouped about the door
of the photograph establishment of Keogh and Clancy Thus in all the
scorched and exotic places of the earth Caucasians meet when the
days work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the
aspersion of alien things

Johnny Atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform
of a Carib and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the
cucumberwood pumps of Dalesburg Dr Gregg through the prestige of
his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent
professional tales was conceded the hammock that was swung between
the door jamb and a calabashtree Keogh had moved out upon the grass
a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed
photographs He was the only busy one of the group Industriously
from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished
depictments of Coralios citizens Blanchard the French mining
engineer in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through
his calm glasses impervious to the heat Clancy sat on the steps
smoking his short pipe His mood was the gossips the others were
reduced by the humidity to the state of disability desirable in an
audience

Clancy was an American with an Irish diathesis and cosmopolitan
proclivities Many businesses had claimed him but not for long
The roadsters blood was in his veins The voice of the tintype was
but one of the many callings that had wooed him upon so many roads
Sometimes he could be persuaded to oral construction of his voyages
into the informal and egregious Tonight there were symptoms of
divulgement in him

Tis elegant weather for filibusterin he volunteered It reminds
me of the time I struggled to liberate a nation from the poisonous
breath of a tyrants clutch Twas hard work Tis strainin to the
back and makes corns on the hands

I didnt know you had ever lent your sword to an oppressed people
murmured Atwood from the grass

I did said Clancy and they turned it into a ploughshare

What country was so fortunate as to secure your aid airily
inquired Blanchard

Wheres Kamchatka asked Clancy with seeming irrelevance

Why off Siberia somewhere in the Arctic regions somebody
answered doubtfully

I thought that was the cold one said Clancy with a satisfied nod
Im always gettin the two names mixed Twas Guatemala thenthe
hot oneIve been filibusterin with Yell find that country on the
map Tis in the district known as the tropics By the foresight of
Providence it lies on the coast so the geography man could run the
names of the towns off into the water Theyre an inch long small
type composed of Spanish dialects and tis my opinion of the same
system of syntax that blew up the _Maine_ Yes twas that country I
sailed against singlehanded and endeavoured to liberate it from
a tyrannical government with a singlebarreled pickaxe unloaded
at that Ye dont understand of course Tis a statement demandin
elucidation and apologies

Twas in New Orleans one morning about the first of June I was
standin down on the wharf lookin about at the ships in the river
There was a little steamer moored right opposite me that seemed about
ready to sail The funnels of it were throwin out smoke and a gang
of roustabouts were carryin aboard a pile of boxes that was stacked
up on the wharf The boxes were about two feet square and somethin
like four feet long and they seemed to be pretty heavy

I walked over careless to the stack of boxes I saw one of them
had been broken in handlin Twas curiosity made me pull up the
loose top and look inside The box was packed full of Winchester
rifles So so says I to myself somebodys gettin a twist on
the neutrality laws Somebodys aidin with munitions of war I
wonder where the popguns are goin

I heard somebody cough and I turned around There stood a
little round fat man with a brown face and white clothes a
firstclasslooking little man with a fourkarat diamond on his
finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects I judged
he was a kind of foreignermay be from Russia or Japan or the
archipelagoes

Hist says the round man full of concealments and confidences
Will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made that the mans
on the ship shall not be acquaint The senor will be a gentleman that
shall not expose one thing that by accident occur

Monseer says Ifor I judged him to be a kind of
Frenchmanreceive my most exasperated assurances that your secret
is safe with James Clancy Furthermore I will go so far as to
remark Veev la Libertyveev it good and strong Whenever you hear
of a Clancy obstructin the abolishment of existin governments you
may notify me by return mail

The senor is good says the dark fat man smilin under his
black mustache Wish you to come aboard my ship and drink of wine a
glass

Bein a Clancy in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated
at a table in the cabin of the steamer with a bottle between us I
could hear the heavy boxes bein dumped into the hold I judged that
cargo must consist of at least 2000 Winchesters Me and the brown
man drank the bottle of stuff and he called the steward to bring
another When you amalgamate a Clancy with the contents of a bottle
you practically instigate secession I had heard a good deal about
these revolutions in them tropical localities and I begun to want a
hand in it

You goin to stir things up in your country aint you monseer
says I with a wink to let him know I was on

Yes yes said the little man pounding his fist on the table
A change of the greatest will occur Too long have the people been
oppressed with the promises and the nevertohappen things to become
The great work it shall be carry on Yes Our forces shall in the
capital city strike of the soonest _Carrambos_

_Carrambos_ is the word says I beginning to invest myself with
enthusiasm and more wine likewise veeva as I said before May the
shamrock of oldI mean the bananavine or the pieplant or whatever
the imperial emblem may be of your downtrodden country wave
forever

A thousand thankyous says the round man for your emission of
amicable utterances What our cause needs of the very most is mans
who will the work do to lift it along Oh for one thousands strong
good mans to aid the General De Vega that he shall to his country
bring those success and glory It is hardoh so hard to find good
mans to help in the work

Monseer says I leanin over the table and graspin his hand
I dont know where your country is but me heart bleeds for it The
heart of a Clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people
The family is filibusterers by birth and foreigners by trade If you
can use James Clancys arms and his blood in denudin your shores of
the tyrants yoke theyre yours to command

General De Vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of
his conspiracies and predicaments He tried to embrace me across the
table but his fatness and the wine that had been in the bottles
prevented Thus was I welcomed into the ranks of filibustery Then
the general man told me his country had the name of Guatemala and
was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere He
looked at me with tears in his eyes and from time to time he would
emit the remark Ah big strong brave mans That is what my
country need

General De Vega as was the name by which he denounced himself
brought out a document for me to sign which I did makin a fine
flourish and curlycue with the tail of the y

Your passagemoney says the general businesslike shall from
your pay be deduct

Twill not says I haughty Ill pay my own passage A hundred
and eighty dollars I had in my inside pocket and twas no common
filibuster I was goin to be filibusterin for me board and clothes

The steamer was to sail in two hours and I went ashore to get some
things together Id need When I came aboard I showed the general
with pride the outfit Twas a fine Chinchilla overcoat Arctic
overshoes fur cap and earmuffs with elegant fleecelined gloves and
woolen muffler

_Carrambos_ says the little general What clothes are these that
shall go to the tropic And then the little spalpeen laughs and he
calls the captain and the captain calls the purser and they pipe up
the chief engineer and the whole gang leans against the cabin and
laughs at Clancys wardrobe for Guatemala

I reflects a bit serious and asks the general again to denominate
the terms by which his country is called He tells me and I see then
that twas the tother one Kamchatka I had in mind Since then Ive
had difficulty in separatin the two nations in name climate and
geographic disposition

I paid my passagetwentyfour dollars first cabinand ate at
table with the officer crowd Down on the lower deck was a gang of
secondclass passengers about forty of them seemin to be Dagoes
and the like I wondered what so many of them were goin along for

Well then in three days we sailed alongside that Guatemala Twas
a blue country and not yellow as tis miscolored on the map We
landed at a town on the coast where a train of cars was waitin for
us on a dinky little railroad The boxes on the steamer were brought
ashore and loaded on the cars The gang of Dagoes got aboard too
the general and me in the front car Yes me and General De Vega
headed the revolution as it pulled out of the seaport town That
train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin to a riot It
penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen
outside a geography We run some forty miles in seven hours and the
train stopped There was no more railroad Twas a sort of camp in a
damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies They was gradin and
choppin out the forests ahead to continue the road Here says I
to myself is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists Here will
Clancy by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation
of Fenian tactics strike a tremendous blow for liberty

They unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops
off From the first one that was open I saw General De Vega take the
Winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery
The other boxes was opened next and believe me or not divil
another gun was to be seen Every other box in the load was full of
pickaxes and spades

And thensorrow be upon them tropicsthe proud Clancy and the
dishonoured Dagoes each one of them had to shoulder a pick or a
spade and march away to work on that dirty little railroad Yes
twas that the Dagoes shipped for and twas that the filibusterin
Clancy signed for though unbeknownst to himself at the time In
after days I found out about it It seems twas hard to get hands
to work on that road The intelligent natives of the country was
too lazy to work Indeed the saints know twas unnecessary By
stretchin out one hand they could seize the most delicate and
costly fruits of the earth and by stretchin out the other they
could sleep for days at a time without hearin a sevenoclock
whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs So
regular the steamers travelled to the United States to seduce
labour Usually the imported spadeslingers died in two or three
months from eatin the overripe water and breathin the violent
tropical scenery Wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year
when they hired them and put an armed guard over the poor divils to
keep them from runnin away

Twas thus I was doublecrossed by the tropics through a family
failin of goin out of the way to hunt disturbances

They gave me a pick and I took it meditatin an insurrection on
the spot but there was the guards handlin the Winchesters careless
and I come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of
filibusterin There was about a hundred of us in the gang startin
out to work and the word was given to move I steps out of the ranks
and goes up to that General De Vega man who was smokin a cigar and
gazin upon the scene with satisfactions and glory He smiles at me
polite and devilish Plenty work says he for big strong mans in
Guatemala Yes Tirty dollars in the month Good pay Ah yes You
strong brave man Bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very
quick They want you go work now _Adios_ strong mans

Monseer says I lingerin will you tell a poor little Irishman
this When I set foot on your cockroachy steamer and breathed
liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine did you
think I was conspirin to sling a pick on your contemptuous little
railroad And when you answered me with patriotic recitations
humping up the starspangled cause of liberty did you have
meditations of reducin me to the ranks of the stumpgrubbin Dagoes
in the chaingangs of your vile and grovelin country

The general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable
Yes he laughed very long and loud and I Clancy stood and waited

Comical mans he shouts at last So you will kill me from the
laughing Yes it is hard to find the brave strong mans to aid my
country Revolutions Did I speak of rrrevolutions Not one word
I say big strong mans is need in Guatemala So The mistake is of
you You have looked in those one box containing those gun for the
guard You think all boxes is contain gun No

There is not war in Guatemala But work Yes Good Tirty dollar
in the month You shall shoulder one pickaxe senor and dig for the
liberty and prosperity of Guatemala Off to your work The guard
waits for you

Little fat poodle dog of a brown man says I quiet but full of
indignations and discomforts things shall happen to you Maybe not
right away but as soon as J Clancy can formulate somethin in the
way of repartee

The boss of the gang orders us to work I tramps off with the
Dagoes and I hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin
hearty as we go

Tis a sorrowful fact for eight weeks I built railroads for that
misbehavin country I filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy
pick and a spade choppin away the luxurious landscape that grew
upon the right of way We worked in swamps that smelled like there
was a leak in the gas mains trampin down a fine assortment of the
most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables The scene was tropical
beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man The trees was
all skyscrapers the underbrush was full of needles and pins
there was monkeys jumpin around and crocodiles and pinktailed
mockinbirds and ye stood kneedeep in the rotten water and
grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala Of nights we would
build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes and sit in the
smoke with the guards pacin all around us There was two hundred
men workin on the roadmostly Dagoes niggermen Spanishmen and
Swedes Three or four were Irish

One old man named Hallorana man of Hibernian entitlements and
discretions explained it to me He had been workin on the road a
year Most of them died in less than six months He was dried up to
gristle and bone and shook with chills every third night

When you first come says he ye think yell leave right away
But they hold out your first months pay for your passage over and
by that time the tropics has its grip on ye Yere surrounded by a
ragin forest full of disreputable beastslions and baboons and
anacondaswaitin to devour ye The sun strikes ye hard and melts
the marrow in your bones Ye get similar to the lettuceeaters the
poetrybook speaks about Ye forget the elevated sintiments of life
such as patriotism revenge disturbances of the peace and the dacint
love of a clane shirt Ye do your work and ye swallow the kerosene
ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the Dago cook for food
Ye light your pipeful and say to yoursilf Nixt week Ill break
away and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar for ye know yell
never do it

Who is this general man asks I that calls himself De Vega

Tis the man says Halloran who is tryin to complete
the finishin of the railroad Twas the project of a private
corporation but it busted and then the government took it up De
Vegy is a big politician and wants to be prisident The people want
the railroad completed as theyre taxed mighty on account of it The
De Vegy man is pushin it along as a campaign move

Tis not my way says I to make threats against any man but
theres an account to be settled between the railroad man and James
ODowd Clancy

Twas that way I thought mesilf at first Halloran says with a
big sigh until I got to be a lettuceeater The faults wid these
tropics They rejuices a mans system Tis a land as the poet says
Where it always seems to be after dinner I does me work and smokes
me pipe and sleeps Theres little else in life anyway Yell get
that way yersilf mighty soon Dont be harbourin any sintiments at
all Clancy

I cant help it says I Im full of em I enlisted in the
revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for
its liberty honours and silver candlesticks instead of which I
am set to amputatin its scenery and grubbin its roots Tis the
general man will have to pay for it

Two months I worked on that railroad before I found a chance to get
away One day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed
line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to Port Barrios to
be sharpened They were brought on a handcar and I noticed when I
started away that the car was left there on the track

That night about twelve I woke up Halloran and told him my scheme

Run away says Halloran Good Lord Clancy do ye mean it Why I
aint got the nerve Its too chilly and I aint slept enough Run
away I told you Clancy Ive eat the lettuce Ive lost my grip
Tis the tropics thats done it Tis like the poet says Forgotten
are our friends that we have left behind in the hollow lettuceland
we will live and lay reclined You better go on Clancy Ill stay
I guess Its too early and cold and Im sleepy

So I had to leave Halloran I dressed quiet and slipped out of the
tent we were in When the guard came along I knocked him over like
a ninepin with a green cocoanut I had and made for the railroad
I got on that handcar and made it fly Twas yet a while before
daybreak when I saw the lights of Port Barrios about a mile away I
stopped the handcar there and walked to the town I stepped inside
the corporations of that town with care and hesitations I was not
afraid of the army of Guatemala but me soul quaked at the prospect
of a handtohand struggle with its employment bureau Tis a country
that hires its help easy and keeps em long Sure I can fancy Missis
America and Missis Guatemala passin a bit of gossip some fine still
night across the mountains Oh dear says Missis America and
its a lot of trouble Im havin agin with the help senora maam
Laws now says Missis Guatemala you dont say so maam Now
mine never think of leavin metehe maam snickers Missis
Guatemala

I was wonderin how I was goin to move away from them tropics
without bein hired again Dark as it was I could see a steamer
ridin in the harbour with smoke emergin from her stacks I turned
down a little grass street that run down to the water On the beach I
found a little brown niggerman just about to shove off in a skiff

Hold on Sambo says I savve English

Heap plenty yes says he with a pleasant grin

What steamer is that I asks him and where is it going And
whats the news and the good word and the time of day

That steamer the _Conchita_ said the brown man affable and easy
rollin a cigarette Him come from New Orleans for load banana Him
got load last night I think him sail in one two hour Verree nice
day we shall be goin have You hear some talkee bout big battle
maybe so You think catchee General De Vega senor Yes No

Hows that Sambo says I Big battle What battle Who wants
catchee General De Vega Ive been up at my old gold mines in the
interior for a couple of months and havent heard any news

Oh says the niggerman proud to speak the English verree great
revolution in Guatemala one week ago General De Vega him try be
president Him raise armeeonefiveten thousand mans for fight
at the government Those one government send fivefortyhundred
thousand soldier to suppress revolution They fight big battle
yesterday at Lomagrandethat about nineteen or fifty mile in the
mountain That government soldier wheep General De Vegaoh most
bad Five hundrednine hundredtwo thousand of his mans is kill
That revolution is smash suppressbustvery quick General De Vega
him rrrun away fast on one big mule Yes _carrambos_ The general
him rrrun away and his armee is kill That government soldier
they try find General De Vega verree much They want catchee him for
shoot You think they catchee that general senor

Saints grant it says I Twould be the judgment of Providence
for settin the warlike talent of a Clancy to gradin the tropics
with a pick and shovel But tis not so much a question of
insurrections now me little man as tis of the hiredman problem
Tis anxious I am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust
with the white wings department of your great and degraded country
Row me in your little boat out to that steamer and Ill give ye five
dollarssinker pacerssinker pacers says I reducin the offer to
the language and denomination of the tropic dialects

_Cinco pesos_ repeats the little man Five dollee you give

Twas not such a bad little man He had hesitations at first sayin
that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports
but at last he took me out alongside the steamer

Day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasnt a soul to
be seen on board The water was very still and the niggerman gave
me a lift from the boat and I climbed onto the steamer where her
side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit The hatches was open
and I looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold
to within six feet of the top I thinks to myself Clancy you
better go as a stowaway Its safer The steamer men might hand you
back to the employment bureau The tropicll get you Clancy if you
dont watch out

So I jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide
in among the bunches In an hour or so I could hear the engines
goin and feel the steamer rockin and I knew we were off to sea
They left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it
was light enough in the hold to see fairly well I got to feelin
a bit hungry and thought Id have a light fruit lunch by way
of refreshment I creeped out of the hole Id made and stood up
straight Just then I saw another man crawl up about ten feet away
and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth Twas
a dirty man blackfaced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect Yes
the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat Weary Willie in the
funny papers I looked again and saw it was my general manDe Vega
the great revolutionist mulerider and pickaxe importer When he saw
me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his
eyes the size of cocoanuts

Hist I says Not a word or theyll put us off and make us walk
Veev la Liberty I adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a
banana into the source of it I was certain the general wouldnt
recognize me The nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin
different There was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face
and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt

How you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he
could speak

By the back doorwhist says I Twas a glorious blow for
liberty we struck I continues but we was overpowered by numbers
Let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana

Were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the
general sheddin tears on the cargo

To the last says I Twas I led the last desperate charge
against the minions of the tyrant But it made them mad and we was
forced to retreat Twas I general procured the mule upon which
you escaped Could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way
general Its a bit out of my reach Thanks

Say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin Ah
_Dios_ And I have not the means to reward your devotion Barely did
I my life bring away _Carrambos_ what a devils animal was that
mule senor Like ships in one storm was I dashed about The skin
on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines Upon the bark
of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump and cause
outrage to the legs of mine In the night to Port Barrios I came I
dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water
shore I find a little boat to be tied I launch myself and row to
the steamer I cannot see any mans on board so I climbed one rope
which hang at the side I then myself hide in the bananas Surely I
say if the ship captains view me they shall throw me again to those
Guatemala Those things are not good Guatemala will shoot General
De Vega Therefore I am hide and remain silent Life itself is
glorious Liberty it is pretty good but so good as life I do not
think

Three days as I said was the trip to New Orleans The general man
and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye Bananas we ate until
they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate but
to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced At night I crawls out
careful on the lower deck and gets a bucket of fresh water

That General De Vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words
and sentences He added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin
himself of conversation He believed I was a revolutionist of his own
party there bein as he told me a good many Americans and other
foreigners in its ranks Twas a braggart and a conceited little
gabbler it was though he considered himself a hero Twas on himself
he wasted all his regrets at the failin of his plot Not a word did
the little balloon have to say about the other misbehavin idiots
that had been shot or run themselves to death in his revolution

The second day out he was feelin pretty braggy and uppish for a
stowedaway conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen
bananas He was tellin me about the great railroad he had been
buildin and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool
Irishman he inveigled from New Orleans to sling a pick on his little
morgue of a narrowgauge line Twas sorrowful to hear the little
dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the
tail of that reckless and silly bird Clancy Laugh he did hearty
and long He shook with laughin the blackfaced rebel and outcast
standin neckdeep in bananas without friends or country

Ah senor he snickers to the death you would have laughed at
that drollest Irish I say to him Strong big mans is need very
much in Guatemala I will blows strike for your downpressed
country he say That shall you do I tell him Ah it was an
Irish so comic He sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for
the guard a few gun He think there is gun in all the box But that
is all pickaxe Yes Ah senor could you the face of that Irish have
seen when they set him to the work

Twas thus the exboss of the employment bureau contributed to the
tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote But now and then he
would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of
liberty and the mule

Twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in
New Orleans Pretty soon we heard the patapat of hundreds of bare
feet and the Dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and
down into the hold Me and the general worked a while at passin up
the bunches and they thought we were part of the gang After about
an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf

Twas a great honour on the hands of an obscure Clancy havin the
entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibusterin
power I first bought for the general and myself many long drinks
and things to eat that were not bananas The general man trotted
along at my side leavin all the arrangements to me I led him
up to Lafayette Square and set him on a bench in the little park
Cigarettes I had bought for him and he humped himself down on the
seat like a little fat contented hobo I look him over as he sets
there and what I see pleases me Brown by nature and instinct he
is now brindled with dirt and dust Praise to the mule his clothes
is mostly strings and flaps Yes the looks of the general man is
agreeable to Clancy

I ask him delicate if by any chance he brought away anybodys
money with him from Guatemala He sighs and bumps his shoulders
against the bench Not a cent All right Maybe he tells me some
of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later The
general was as clear a case of no visible means as I ever saw

I told him not to move from the bench and then I went up to the
corner of Poydras and Carondelet Along there is OHaras beat In
five minutes along comes OHara a big fine man redfaced with
shinin buttons swingin his club Twould be a fine thing for
Guatemala to move into OHaras precinct Twould be a fine bit of
recreation for Danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or
twice a week with his club

Is 5046 workin yet Danny says I walkin up to him

Overtime says OHara lookin over me suspicious Want some of
it

Fiftyfortysix is the celebrated city ordinance authorizin arrest
conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealin
their crimes from the police

Dont ye know Jimmy Clancy says I Ye pinkgilled monster So
when OHara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed
upon me by the tropics I backed him into a doorway and told him what
I wanted and why I wanted it All right Jimmy says OHara Go
back and hold the bench Ill be along in ten minutes

In that time OHara strolled through Lafayette Square and spied two
Weary Willies disgracin one of the benches In ten minutes more J
Clancy and General De Vega late candidate for the presidency of
Guatemala was in the station house The general is badly frightened
and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank

The man says I to the police used to be a railroad man Hes on
the bum now Tis a little bughouse he is on account of losin his
job

_Carrambos_ says the general fizzin like a little sodawater
fountain you fought senor with my forces in my native country
Why do you say the lies You shall say I am the General De Vega one
soldier one _caballero_

Railroader says I again On the hog No good Been livin for
three days on stolen bananas Look at him Aint that enough

Twentyfive dollars or sixty days was what the recorder gave the
general He didnt have a cent so he took the time They let me go
as I knew they would for I had money to show and OHara spoke for
me Yes sixty days he got Twas just so long that I slung a pick
for the great country of KamGuatemala

Clancy paused The bright starlight showed a reminiscent look of
happy content on his seasoned features Keogh leaned in his chair and
gave his partner a slap on his thinlyclad back that sounded like the
crack of the surf on the sands

Tell em ye divil he chuckled how you got even with the
tropical general in the way of agricultural manoeuvrings

XI

THE REMNANTS OF THE CODE


Breakfast in Coralio was at eleven Therefore the people did not go
to market early The little wooden markethouse stood on a patch of
shorttrimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a breadfruit
tree

Thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their
wares with them A porch or platform six feet wide encircled the
building shaded from the midmorning sun by the projecting
grassthatched roof Upon this platform the venders were wont to
display their goodsnewlykilled beef fish crabs fruit of the
country cassava eggs _dulces_ and high tottering stacks of native
tortillas as large around as the sombrero of a Spanish grandee

But on this morning they whose stations lay on the seaward side of
the markethouse instead of spreading their merchandise formed
themselves into a softly jabbering and gesticulating group For
there upon their space of the platform was sprawled asleep the
unbeautiful figure of Beelzebub Blythe He lay upon a ragged strip
of cocoa matting more than ever a fallen angel in appearance His
suit of coarse flax soiled bursting at the seams crumpled into
a thousand diversified wrinkles and creases inclosed him absurdly
like the garb of some effigy that had been stuffed in sport and
thrown there after indignity had been wrought upon it But firmly
upon the high bridge of his nose reposed his goldrimmed glasses the
surviving badge of his ancient glory

The suns rays reflecting quiveringly from the rippling sea upon his
face and the voices of the marketmen woke Beelzebub Blythe He
sat up blinking and leaned his back against the wall of the market
Drawing a blighted silk handkerchief from his pocket he assiduously
rubbed and burnished his glasses And while doing this he became
aware that his bedroom had been invaded and that polite brown and
yellow men were beseeching him to vacate in favour of their market
stuff

If the senor would have the goodnessa thousand pardons for bringing
to him molestationbut soon would come the _compradores_ for the
days provisionssurely they had ten thousand regrets at disturbing
him

In this manner they expanded to him the intimation that he must clear
out and cease to clog the wheels of trade

Blythe stepped from the platform with the air of a prince leaving
his canopied couch He never quite lost that air even at the lowest
point of his fall It is clear that the college of good breeding does
not necessarily maintain a chair of morals within its walls

Blythe shook out his wry clothing and moved slowly up the Calle
Grande through the hot sand He moved without a destination in his
mind The little town was languidly stirring to its daily life
Goldenskinned babies tumbled over one another in the grass The sea
breeze brought him appetite but nothing to satisfy it Throughout
Coralio were its morning odorsthose from the heavily fragrant
tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of
clay and the pervading smoke of their fires Where the smoke cleared
the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove
the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might
count the scarred glades on their wooded sides The lightfooted
Caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside Already
along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were
slowly moving concealed except for their nodding heads and plodding
legs by the bunches of greengolden fruit heaped upon their backs
On doorsills sat women combing their long black hair and calling
one to another across the narrow thoroughfares Peace reigned in
Coralioarid and bald peace but still peace

On that bright morning when Nature seemed to be offering the lotus on
the Dawns golden platter Beelzebub Blythe had reached rock bottom
Further descent seemed impossible That last nights slumber in
a public place had done for him As long as he had had a roof to
cover him there had remained unbridged the space that separates a
gentleman from the beasts of the jungle and the fowls of the air But
now he was little more than a whimpering oyster led to be devoured on
the sands of a Southern sea by the artful walrus Circumstance and
the implacable carpenter Fate

To Blythe money was now but a memory He had drained his friends of
all that their goodfellowship had to offer then he had squeezed
them to the last drop of their generosity and at the last
Aaronlike he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the
scattering ignoble drops of Charity itself

He had exhausted his credit to the last _real_ With the minute
keenness of the shameless sponger he was aware of every source in
Coralio from which a glass of rum a meal or a piece of silver could
be wheedled Marshalling each such source in his mind he considered
it with all the thoroughness and penetration that hunger and thirst
lent him for the task All his optimism failed to thresh a grain of
hope from the chaff of his postulations He had played out the game
That one night in the open had shaken his nerves Until then there
had been left to him at least a few grounds upon which he could base
his unblushing demands upon his neighbours stores Now he must beg
instead of borrowing The most brazen sophistry could not dignify by
the name of loan the coin contemptuously flung to a beachcomber who
slept on the bare boards of the public market

But on this morning no beggar would have more thankfully received
a charitable coin for the demon thirst had him by the throatthe
drunkards matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each
morning station on the road to Tophet

Blythe walked slowly up the street keeping a watchful eye for any
miracle that might drop manna upon him in his wilderness As he
passed the popular eating house of Madama Vasquez Madamas boarders
were just sitting down to freshlybaked bread _aguacates_ pines and
delicious coffee that sent forth odorous guarantee of its quality
upon the breeze Madama was serving she turned her shy stolid
melancholy gaze for a moment out the window she saw Blythe and her
expression turned more shy and embarrassed Beelzebub owed her
twenty _pesos_ He bowed as he had once bowed to less embarrassed
dames to whom he owed nothing and passed on

Merchants and their clerks were throwing open the solid wooden doors
of their shops Polite but cool were the glances they cast upon
Blythe as he lounged tentatively by with the remains of his old
jaunty air for they were his creditors almost without exception

At the little fountain in the _plaza_ he made an apology for a toilet
with his wetted handkerchief Across the open square filed the
dolorous line of friends of the prisoners in the _calaboza_ bearing
the morning meal of the immured The food in their hands aroused
small longing in Blythe It was drink that his soul craved or money
to buy it

In the streets he met many with whom he had been friends and equals
and whose patience and liberality he had gradually exhausted
Willard Geddie and Paula cantered past him with the coolest of nods
returning from their daily horseback ride along the old Indian road
Keogh passed him at another corner whistling cheerfully and bearing
a prize of newlylaid eggs for the breakfast of himself and Clancy
The jovial scout of Fortune was one of Blythes victims who had
plunged his hand oftenest into his pocket to aid him But now it
seemed that Keogh too had fortified himself against further
invasions His curt greeting and the ominous light in his full grey
eye quickened the steps of Beelzebub whom desperation had almost
incited to attempt an additional loan

Three drinking shops the forlorn one next visited in succession In
all of these his money his credit and his welcome had long since
been spent but Blythe felt that he would have fawned in the dust at
the feet of an enemy that morning for one draught of _aguardiente_
In two of the _pulperias_ his courageous petition for drink was met
with a refusal so polite that it stung worse than abuse The third
establishment had acquired something of American methods and here he
was seized bodily and cast out upon his hands and knees

This physical indignity caused a singular change in the man As he
picked himself up and walked away an expression of absolute relief
came upon his features The specious and conciliatory smile that
had been graven there was succeeded by a look of calm and sinister
resolve Beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbity
holding by a slender lifeline to the respectable world that had
cast him overboard He must have felt that with this ultimate shock
the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the
drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle

Blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the
sand from his garments and repolished his glasses

Ive got to do itoh Ive got to do it he told himself aloud
If I had a quart of rum I believe I could stave it off yetfor a
little while But theres no more rum forBeelzebub as they call
me By the flames of Tartarus if Im to sit at the right hand of
Satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses Youll have to pony
up Mr Frank Goodwin Youre a good fellow but a gentleman must
draw the line at being kicked into the gutter Blackmail isnt a
pretty word but its the next station on the road Im travelling

With purpose in his steps Blythe now moved rapidly through the town
by way of its landward environs He passed through the squalid
quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque
shacks of the poorer _mestizos_ From many points along his course he
could see through the umbrageous glades the house of Frank Goodwin
on its wooded hill And as he crossed the little bridge over the
lagoon he saw the old Indian Galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab
that bore the name of Miraflores Beyond the lagoon the lands of
Goodwin began to slope gently upward A grassy road shaded by a
munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of
an outlying banana grove to the dwelling Blythe took this road with
long and purposeful strides

Goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his
secretary a sallow and capable native youth The household adhered
to the American plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of
the past for the better part of an hour

The castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand

Good morning Blythe said Goodwin looking up Come in and have a
chair Anything I can do for you

I want to speak to you in private

Goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree
and lit a cigarette Blythe took the chair that he had left vacant

I want some money he began doggedly

Im sorry said Goodwin with equal directness but you cant have
any Youre drinking yourself to death Blythe Your friends have
done all they could to help you to brace up You wont help yourself
Theres no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any
longer

Dear man said Blythe tilting back his chair it isnt a question
of social economy now Its past that I like you Goodwin and Ive
come to stick a knife between your ribs I was kicked out of Espadas
saloon this morning and Society owes me reparation for my wounded
feelings

I didnt kick you out

No but in a general way you represent Society and in a particular
way you represent my last chance Ive had to come down to it old
manI tried to do it a month ago when Losadas man was here turning
things over but I couldnt do it then Now its different I want a
thousand dollars Goodwin and youll have to give it to me

Only last week said Goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was
all you were asking for

An evidence said Blythe flippantly that I was still
virtuousthough under heavy pressure The wages of sin should be
something higher than a _peso_ worth fortyeight cents Lets talk
business I am the villain in the third act and I must have my
merited if only temporary triumph I saw you collar the late
presidents valiseful of boodle Oh I know its blackmail but Im
liberal about the price I know Im a cheap villainone of the
regular sawmilldrama kindbut youre one of my particular friends
and I dont want to stick you hard

Suppose you go into the details suggested Goodwin calmly
arranging his letters on the table

All right said Beelzebub I like the way you take it I despise
histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts
without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone

On the night that His Flybynight Excellency arrived in town I
was very drunk You will excuse the pride with which I state that
fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state
Somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of
Madama Ortizs hotel I stepped over the wall laid down upon it and
fell asleep I was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree
upon my nose and I laid there for awhile cursing Sir Isaac Newton
or whoever it was that invented gravitation for not confining his
theory to apples

And then along came Mr Miraflores and his truelove with the
treasury in a valise and went into the hotel Next you hove in
sight and held a powwow with the tonsorial artist who insisted upon
talking shop after hours I tried to slumber again but once more my
rest was disturbedthis time by the noise of the popgun that went
off upstairs Then that valise came crashing down into an orange
tree just above my head and I arose from my couch not knowing
when it might begin to rain Saratoga trunks When the army and the
constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations
hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn I
crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant I remained there
for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared
away And then my dear Goodwinexcuse meI saw you sneak back and
pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree I followed
you and saw you take it to your own house A hundredthousanddollar
crop from one orange tree in a season about breaks the record of the
fruitgrowing industry

Being a gentleman at that time of course I never mentioned the
incident to anyone But this morning I was kicked out of a saloon
my code of honour is all out at the elbows and Id sell my mothers
prayerbook for three fingers of _aguardiente_ Im not putting on
the screws hard It ought to be worth a thousand to you for me to
have slept on that cot through the whole business without waking up
and seeing anything

Goodwin opened two more letters and made memoranda in pencil on
them Then he called Manuel to his secretary who came spryly

The _Ariel_when does she sail asked Goodwin

Senor answered the youth at three this afternoon She drops
downcoast to Punta Soledad to complete her cargo of fruit From
there she sails for New Orleans without delay

_Bueno_ said Goodwin These letters may wait yet awhile

The secretary returned to his cigarette under the mango tree

In round numbers said Goodwin facing Blythe squarely how much
money do you owe in this town not including the sums you have
borrowed from me

Five hundredat a rough guess answered Blythe lightly

Go somewhere in the town and draw up a schedule of your debts said
Goodwin Come back here in two hours and I will send Manuel with
the money to pay them I will also have a decent outfit of clothing
ready for you You will sail on the _Ariel_ at three Manuel will
accompany you as far as the deck of the steamer There he will hand
you one thousand dollars in cash I suppose that we neednt discuss
what you will be expected to do in return

Oh I understand piped Blythe cheerily I was asleep all the
time on the cot under Madama Ortizs orange trees and I shake off
the dust of Coralio forever Ill play fair No more of the lotus
for me Your proposition is O K Youre a good fellow Goodwin
and I let you off light Ill agree to everything But in the
meantimeIve a devil of a thirst on old man

Not a _centavo_ said Goodwin firmly until you are on board the
_Ariel_ You would be drunk in thirty minutes if you had money now

But he noticed the bloodstreaked eyeballs the relaxed form and the
shaking hands of Beelzebub and he stepped into the dining room
through the low window and brought out a glass and a decanter of
brandy

Take a bracer anyway before you go he proposed even as a man to
the friend whom he entertains

Beelzebub Blythes eyes glistened at the sight of the solace for
which his soul burned Today for the first time his poisoned nerves
had been denied their steadying dose and their retort was a mounting
torment He grasped the decanter and rattled its crystal mouth
against the glass in his trembling hand He flushed the glass and
then stood erect holding it aloft for an instant For one fleeting
moment he held his head above the drowning waves of his abyss He
nodded easily at Goodwin raised his brimming glass and murmured a
health that men had used in his ancient Paradise Lost And then so
suddenly that he spilled the brandy over his hand he set down his
glass untasted

In two hours his dry lips muttered to Goodwin as he marched down
the steps and turned his face toward the town

In the edge of the cool banana grove Beelzebub halted and snapped
the tongue of his belt buckle into another hole

I couldnt do it he explained feverishly to the waving banana
fronds I wanted to but I couldnt A gentleman cant drink with
the man that he blackmails

SHOES


John De Graffenreid Atwood ate of the lotus root stem and flower
The tropics gobbled him up He plunged enthusiastically into his
work which was to try to forget Rosine

Now they who dine on the lotus rarely consume it plain There is a
sauce _au diable_ that goes with it and the distillers are the chefs
who prepare it And on Johnnys menu card it read brandy With a
bottle between them he and Billy Keogh would sit on the porch of the
little consulate at night and roar out great indecorous songs until
the natives slipping hastily past would shrug a shoulder and mutter
things to themselves about the _Americanos diablos_

One day Johnnys _mozo_ brought the mail and dumped it on the table
Johnny leaned from his hammock and fingered the four or five
letters dejectedly Keogh was sitting on the edge of the table
chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that
was crawling among the stationery Johnny was in that phase of
lotuseating when all the world tastes bitter in ones mouth

Same old thing he complained Fool people writing for information
about the country They want to know all about raising fruit and how
to make a fortune without work Half of em dont even send stamps
for a reply They think a consul hasnt anything to do but write
letters Slit those envelopes for me old man and see what they
want Im feeling too rocky to move

Keogh acclimated beyond all possibility of illhumour drew
his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rosepink
countenance and began to slit open the letters Four of them were
from citizens in various parts of the United States who seemed to
regard the consul at Coralio as a cyclopaedia of information They
asked long lists of questions numerically arranged about the
climate products possibilities laws business chances and
statistics of the country in which the consul had the honour of
representing his own government

Write em please Billy said that inert official just a line
referring them to the latest consular report Tell em the State
Department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems Sign my
name Dont let your pen scratch Billy itll keep me awake

Dont snore said Keogh amiably and Ill do your work for you
You need a corps of assistants anyhow Dont see how you ever get
out a report Wake up a minuteheres one more letterits from
your own town tooDalesburg

That so murmured Johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest
Whats it about

Postmaster writes explained Keogh Says a citizen of the town
wants some facts and advice from you Says the citizen has an idea in
his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store Wants
to know if you think the business would pay Says hes heard of the
boom along this coast and wants to get in on the ground floor

In spite of the heat and his bad temper Johnnys hammock swayed
with his laughter Keogh laughed too and the pet monkey on the top
shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical
reception of the letter from Dalesburg

Great bunions exclaimed the consul Shoe store Whatll they ask
about next I wonder Overcoat factory I reckon Say Billyof our
3000 citizens how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes

Keogh reflected judicially

Lets seetheres you and me and

Not me said Johnny promptly and incorrectly holding up a foot
encased in a disreputable deerskin _zapato_ I havent been a victim
to shoes in months

But youve got em though went on Keogh And theres Goodwin
and Blanchard and Geddie and old Lutz and Doc Gregg and that Italian
thats agent for the banana company and theres old Delgadono
he wears sandals And oh yes theres Madama Ortiz what kapes
the hotelshe had on a pair of red slippers at the _baile_ the
other night And Miss Pasa her daughter that went to school in
the Statesshe brought back some civilized notions in the way of
footgear And theres the _comandantes_ sister that dresses up her
feet on feastdaysand Mrs Geddie who wears a two with a Castilian
instepand thats about all the ladies Lets seedont some of the
soldiers at the _cuartel_no thats so theyre allowed shoes only
when on the march In barracks they turn their little toeses out to
grass

Bout right agreed the consul Not over twenty out of the three
thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements Oh yes
Coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe storethat doesnt
want to part with its goods Wonder if old Patterson is trying to
jolly me He always was full of things he called jokes Write him a
letter Billy Ill dictate it Well jolly him back a few

Keogh dipped his pen and wrote at Johnnys dictation With many
pauses filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle
and glasses the following reply to the Dalesburg communication was
perpetrated


 MR OBADIAH PATTERSON
 Dalesburg Ala

 _Dear Sir_ In reply to your favour of July 2d I have the
 honour to inform you that according to my opinion there
 is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye
 stronger evidence of the need of a firstclass shoe store
 than does the town of Coralio There are 3000 inhabitants
 in the place and not a single shoe store The situation
 speaks for itself This coast is rapidly becoming the goal
 of enterprising business men but the shoe business is one
 that has been sadly overlooked or neglected In fact there
 are a considerable number of our citizens actually without
 shoes at present

 Besides the want above mentioned there is also a crying
 need for a brewery a college of higher mathematics a coal
 yard and a clean and intellectual Punch and Judy show I
 have the honour to be sir

 Your Obt Servant

 JOHN DE GRAFFENREID ATWOOD
 U S Consul at Coralio

 PSHello Uncle Obadiah Hows the old burg racking
 along What would the government do without you and me
 Look out for a greenheaded parrot and a bunch of bananas
 soon from your old friend

 JOHNNY


I throw in that postscript explained the consul so Uncle Obadiah
wont take offence at the official tone of the letter Now Billy
you get that correspondence fixed up and send Pancho to the
postoffice with it The _Ariadne_ takes the mail out tomorrow if
they make up that load of fruit today

The night programme in Coralio never varied The recreations of the
people were soporific and flat They wandered about barefoot and
aimless speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette Looking
down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze
of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies
In some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the
depression of the _triste_ night Giant treefrogs rattled in the
foliage as loudly as the end mans bones in a minstrel troupe By
nine oclock the streets were almost deserted

Nor at the consulate was there often a change of bill Keogh would
come there nightly for Coralios one cool place was the little
seaward porch of that official residence

The brandy would be kept moving and before midnight sentiment would
begin to stir in the heart of the selfexiled consul Then he would
relate to Keogh the story of his ended romance Each night Keogh
would listen patiently to the tale and be ready with untiring
sympathy

But dont you think for a minutethus Johnny would always conclude
his woeful narrativethat Im grieving about that girl Billy Ive
forgotten her She never enters my mind If she were to enter that
door right now my pulse wouldnt gain a beat Thats all over long
ago

Dont I know it Keogh would answer Of course youve forgotten
her Proper thing to do Wasnt quite O K of her to listen to the
knocks thaterDink Pawson kept giving you

Pink Dawsona world of contempt would be in Johnnys tonesPoor
white trash Thats what he was Had five hundred acres of farming
land though and that counted Maybe Ill have a chance to get back
at him some day The Dawsons werent anybody Everybody in Alabama
knows the Atwoods Say Billydid you know my mother was a De
Graffenreid

Why no Keogh would say is that so He had heard it some three
hundred times

Fact The De Graffenreids of Hancock County But I never think of
that girl any more do I Billy

Not for a minute my boy would be the last sounds heard by the
conqueror of Cupid

At this point Johnny would fall into a gentle slumber and Keogh
would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the
edge of the plaza

In a day or two the letter from the Dalesburg postmaster and its
answer had been forgotten by the Coralio exiles But on the 26th day
of July the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events

The _Andador_ a fruit steamer that visited Coralio regularly drew
into the offing and anchored The beach was lined with spectators
while the quarantine doctor and the customhouse crew rowed out to
attend to their duties

An hour later Billy Keogh lounged into the consulate clean and cool
in his linen clothes and grinning like a pleased shark

Guess what he said to Johnny lounging in his hammock

Too hot to guess said Johnny lazily

Your shoestore mans come said Keogh rolling the sweet morsel on
his tongue with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent
as far down as Terra del Fuego Theyre carting his cases over to
the customhouse now Six barges full they brought ashore and have
paddled back for the rest Oh ye saints in glory wont there
be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an
interview with Mr Consul Itll be worth nine years in the tropics
just to witness that one joyful moment

Keogh loved to take his mirth easily He selected a clean place
on the matting and lay upon the floor The walls shook with his
enjoyment Johnny turned half over and blinked

Dont tell me he said that anybody was fool enough to take that
letter seriously

Fourthousanddollar stock of goods gasped Keogh in ecstasy
Talk about coals to Newcastle Why didnt he take a shipload of
palmleaf fans to Spitzbergen while he was about it Saw the old
codger on the beach You ought to have been there when he put on his
specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens
standing around

Are you telling the truth Billy asked the consul weakly

Am I You ought to see the buncoed gentlemans daughter he brought
along Looks She makes the brickdust senoritas here look like
tarbabies

Go on said Johnny if you can stop that asinine giggling I hate
to see a grown man make a laughing hyena of himself

Name is Hemstetter went on Keogh Hes a Hello whats the
matter now

Johnnys moccasined feet struck the floor with a thud as he wriggled
out of his hammock

Get up you idiot he said sternly or Ill brain you with this
inkstand Thats Rosine and her father Gad what a drivelling idiot
old Patterson is Get up here Billy Keogh and help me What the
devil are we going to do Has all the world gone crazy

Keogh rose and dusted himself He managed to regain a decorous
demeanour

Situation has got to be met Johnny he said with some success
at seriousness I didnt think about its being your girl until you
spoke First thing to do is to get them comfortable quarters You go
down and face the music and Ill trot out to Goodwins and see if
Mrs Goodwin wont take them in Theyve got the decentest house in
town

Bless you Billy said the consul I knew you wouldnt desert me
The worlds bound to come to an end but maybe we can stave it off
for a day or two

Keogh hoisted his umbrella and set out for Goodwins house Johnny
put on his coat and hat He picked up the brandy bottle but set it
down again without drinking and marched bravely down to the beach

In the shade of the customhouse walls he found Mr Hemstetter and
Rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens The customs officers
were ducking and scraping while the captain of the _Andador_
interpreted the business of the new arrivals Rosine looked healthy
and very much alive She was gazing at the strange scenes around her
with amused interest There was a faint blush upon her round cheek as
she greeted her old admirer Mr Hemstetter shook hands with Johnny
in a very friendly way He was an oldish impractical manone
of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever
dissatisfied and seeking a change

I am very glad to see you Johnmay I call you John he said Let
me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmasters letter of
inquiry He volunteered to write to you on my behalf I was looking
about for something different in the way of a business in which the
profits would be greater I had noticed in the papers that this coast
was receiving much attention from investors I am extremely grateful
for your advice to come I sold out everything that I possess and
invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought
in the North You have a picturesque town here John I hope business
will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting

Johnnys agony was abbreviated by the arrival of Keogh who hurried
up with the news that Mrs Goodwin would be much pleased to place
rooms at the disposal of Mr Hemstetter and his daughter So there
Mr Hemstetter and Rosine were at once conducted and left to
recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while Johnny went down
to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs
warehouse pending their examination by the officials Keogh grinning
like a shark skirmished about to find Goodwin to instruct him not
to expose to Mr Hemstetter the true state of Coralio as a shoe
market until Johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation
if such a thing were possible

That night the consul and Keogh held a desperate consultation on the
breezy porch of the consulate

Send em back home began Keogh reading Johnnys thoughts

I would said Johnny after a little silence but Ive been lying
to you Billy

All right about that said Keogh affably

Ive told you hundreds of times said Johnny slowly that I had
forgotten that girl havent I

About three hundred and seventyfive admitted the monument of
patience

I lied repeated the consul every time I never forgot her for
one minute I was an obstinate ass for running away just because she
said No once And I was too proud a fool to go back I talked with
Rosine a few minutes this evening up at Goodwins I found out one
thing You remember that farmer fellow who was always after her

Dink Pawson asked Keogh

Pink Dawson Well he wasnt a hill of beans to her She says she
didnt believe a word of the things he told her about me But Im
sewed up now Billy That tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever
chance I had left Shell despise me when she finds out that her old
father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent school boy
wouldnt have been guilty of Shoes Why he couldnt sell twenty
pairs of shoes in Coralio if he kept store here for twenty years You
put a pair of shoes on one of these Caribs or Spanish brown boys and
whatd he do Stand on his head and squeal until hed kicked em off
None of em ever wore shoes and they never will If I send em back
home Ill have to tell the whole story and whatll she think of
me I want that girl worse than ever Billy and now when shes in
reach Ive lost her forever because I tried to be funny when the
thermometer was at 102

Keep cheerful said the optimistic Keogh And let em open the
store Ive been busy myself this afternoon We can stir up a
temporary boom in footgear anyhow Ill buy six pairs when the doors
open Ive been around and seen all the fellows and explained the
catastrophe Theyll all buy shoes like they was centipedes Frank
Goodwin will take cases of em The Geddies want about eleven pairs
between em Clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks and even
old Doc Gregg wants three pairs of alligatorhide slippers if theyve
got any tens Blanchard got a look at Miss Hemstetter and as hes a
Frenchman no less than a dozen pairs will do for him

A dozen customers said Johnny for a 4000 stock of shoes It
wont work Theres a big problem here to figure out You go home
Billy and leave me alone Ive got to work at it all by myself Take
that bottle of Threestar along with youno sir not another ounce
of booze for the United States consul Ill sit here tonight and
pull out the think stop If theres a soft place on this proposition
anywhere Ill land on it If there isnt therell be another wreck to
the credit of the gorgeous tropics

Keogh left feeling that he could be of no use Johnny laid a handful
of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair When
the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbour ripples he was
still sitting there Then he got up whistling a little tune and
took his bath

At nine oclock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and
hung for half an hour over a blank The result of his application was
the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost
of 33

SHIPS


Within a week a suitable building had been secured in the Calle
Grande and Mr Hemstetters stock of shoes arranged upon their
shelves The rent of the store was moderate and the stock made a
fine showing of neat white boxes attractively displayed

Johnnys friends stood by him loyally On the first day Keogh
strolled into the store in a casual kind of way about once every
hour and bought shoes After he had purchased a pair each of
extension soles congress gaiters button kids lowquartered calfs
dancing pumps rubber boots tans of various hues tennis shoes and
flowered slippers he sought out Johnny to be prompted as to names
of other kinds that he might inquire for The other Englishspeaking
residents also played their parts nobly by buying often and
liberally Keogh was grand marshal and made them distribute their
patronage thus keeping up a fair run of custom for several days

Mr Hemstetter was gratified by the amount of business done thus far
but expressed surprise that the natives were so backward with their
custom

Oh theyre awfully shy explained Johnny as he wiped his forehead
nervously Theyll get the habit pretty soon Theyll come with a
rush when they do come

One afternoon Keogh dropped into the consuls office chewing an
unlighted cigar thoughtfully

Got anything up your sleeve he inquired of Johnny If you have
its about time to show it If you can borrow some gents hat in the
audience and make a lot of customers for an idle stock of shoes
come out of it youd better spiel The boys have all laid in enough
footwear to last em ten years and theres nothing doing in the shoe
store but dolcy far nienty I just came by there Your venerable
victim was standing in the door gazing through his specs at the
bare toes passing by his emporium The natives here have got the
true artistic temperament Me and Clancy took eighteen tintypes this
morning in two hours Theres been but one pair of shoes sold all
day Blanchard went in and bought a pair of furlined houseslippers
because he thought he saw Miss Hemstetter go into the store I saw
him throw the slippers into the lagoon afterwards

Theres a Mobile fruit steamer coming in tomorrow or next day
said Johnny We cant do anything until then

What are you going to dotry to create a demand

Political economy isnt your strong point said the consul
impudently You cant create a demand But you can create a
necessity for a demand Thats what I am going to do

Two weeks after the consul sent his cable a fruit steamer brought
him a huge mysterious brown bale of some unknown commodity Johnnys
influence with the customhouse people was sufficiently strong for
him to get the goods turned over to him without the usual inspection
He had the bale taken to the consulate and snugly stowed in the back
room

That night he ripped open a corner of it and took out a handful of
the cockleburrs He examined them with the care with which a warrior
examines his arms before he goes forth to battle for his ladylove
and life The burrs were the ripe August product as hard as
filberts and bristling with spines as tough and sharp as needles
Johnny whistled softly a little tune and went out to find Billy
Keogh

Later in the night when Coralio was steeped in slumber he and Billy
went forth into the deserted streets with their coats bulging like
balloons All up and down the Calle Grande they went sowing the
sharp burrs carefully in the sand along the narrow sidewalks in
every foot of grass between the silent houses And then they took the
side streets and byways missing none No place where the foot of
man woman or child might fall was slighted Many trips they made to
and from the prickly hoard And then nearly at the dawn they laid
themselves down to rest calmly as great generals do after planning
a victory according to the revised tactics and slept knowing that
they had sowed with the accuracy of Satan sowing tares and the
perseverance of Paul planting

With the rising sun came the purveyors of fruits and meats and
arranged their wares in and around the little markethouse At one
end of the town near the seashore the markethouse stood and the
sowing of the burrs had not been carried that far The dealers waited
long past the hour when their sales usually began None came to buy
_Que hay_ they began to exclaim one to another

At their accustomed time from every dobe and palm hut and
grassthatched shack and dim _patio_ glided womenblack women brown
women lemoncolored women women dun and yellow and tawny They
were the marketers starting to purchase the family supply of cassava
plantains meat fowls and tortillas Decollete they were and
barearmed and barefooted with a single skirt reaching below the
knee Stolid and oxeyed they stepped from their doorways into the
narrow paths or upon the soft grass of the streets

The first to emerge uttered ambiguous squeals and raised one foot
quickly Another step and they sat down with shrill cries of alarm
to pick at the new and painful insects that had stung them upon the
feet _Que picadores diablos_ they screeched to one another across
the narrow ways Some tried the grass instead of the paths but there
they were also stung and bitten by the strange little prickly balls
They plumped down in the grass and added their lamentations to those
of their sisters in the sandy paths All through the town was heard
the plaint of the feminine jabber The venders in the market still
wondered why no customers came

Then men lords of the earth came forth They too began to hop
to dance to limp and to curse They stood stranded and foolish or
stooped to pluck at the scourge that attacked their feet and ankles
Some loudly proclaimed the pest to be poisonous spiders of an unknown
species

And then the children ran out for their morning romp And now to
the uproar was added the howls of limping infants and cockleburred
childhood Every minute the advancing day brought forth fresh
victims

Dona Maria Castillas y Buenventura de las Casas stepped from her
honoured doorway as was her daily custom to procure fresh bread
from the _panaderia_ across the street She was clad in a skirt of
flowered yellow satin a chemise of ruffled linen and wore a purple
mantilla from the looms of Spain Her lemontinted feet alas were
bare Her progress was majestic for were not her ancestors hidalgos
of Aragon Three steps she made across the velvety grass and
set her aristocratic sole upon a bunch of Johnnys burrs Dona
Maria Castillas y Buenventura de las Casas emitted a yowl even
as a wildcat Turning about she fell upon hands and knees and
crawleday like a beast of the field she crawled back to her
honourable doorsill

Don Senor Ildefonso Federico Valdazar _Juez de la Paz_ weighing
twenty stone attempted to convey his bulk to the _pulperia_ at
the corner of the plaza in order to assuage his matutinal thirst
The first plunge of his unshod foot into the cool grass struck a
concealed mine Don Ildefonso fell like a crumpled cathedral crying
out that he had been fatally bitten by a deadly scorpion Everywhere
were the shoeless citizens hopping stumbling limping and picking
from their feet the venomous insects that had come in a single night
to harass them

The first to perceive the remedy was Esteban Delgado the barber a
man of travel and education Sitting upon a stone he plucked burrs
from his toes and made oration

Behold my friends these bugs of the devil I know them well They
soar through the skies in swarms like pigeons These are the dead
ones that fell during the night In Yucatan I have seen them as large
as oranges Yes There they hiss like serpents and have wings like
bats It is the shoesthe shoes that one needs _Zapatoszapatos
para mi_

Esteban hobbled to Mr Hemstetters store and bought shoes Coming
out he swaggered down the street with impunity reviling loudly the
bugs of the devil The suffering ones sat up or stood upon one foot
and beheld the immune barber Men women and children took up the
cry _Zapatos zapatos_

The necessity for the demand had been created The demand followed
That day Mr Hemstetter sold three hundred pairs of shoes

It is really surprising he said to Johnny who came up in the
evening to help him straighten out the stock how trade is picking
up Yesterday I made but three sales

I told you theyd whoop things up when they got started said the
consul

I think I shall order a dozen more cases of goods to keep the stock
up said Mr Hemstetter beaming through his spectacles

I wouldnt send in any orders yet advised Johnny Wait till you
see how the trade holds up

Each night Johnny and Keogh sowed the crop that grew dollars by day
At the end of ten days twothirds of the stock of shoes had been
sold and the stock of cockleburrs was exhausted Johnny cabled to
Pink Dawson for another 500 pounds paying twenty cents per pound as
before Mr Hemstetter carefully made up an order for 1500 worth of
shoes from Northern firms Johnny hung about the store until this
order was ready for the mail and succeeded in destroying it before
it reached the postoffice

That night he took Rosine under the mango tree by Goodwins porch
and confessed everything She looked him in the eye and said You
are a very wicked man Father and I will go back home You say it was
a joke I think it is a very serious matter

But at the end of half an hours argument the conversation had
been turned upon a different subject The two were considering the
respective merits of pale blue and pink wall paper with which the
old colonial mansion of the Atwoods in Dalesburg was to be decorated
after the wedding

On the next morning Johnny confessed to Mr Hemstetter The shoe
merchant put on his spectacles and said through them You strike me
as being a most extraordinary young scamp If I had not managed this
enterprise with good business judgment my entire stock of goods might
have been a complete loss Now how do you propose to dispose of the
rest of it

When the second invoice of cockleburrs arrived Johnny loaded them and
the remainder of the shoes into a schooner and sailed down the coast
to Alazan

There in the same dark and diabolical manner he repeated his
success and came back with a bag of money and not so much as a
shoestring

And then he besought his great Uncle of the waving goatee and starred
vest to accept his resignation for the lotus no longer lured him He
hankered for the spinach and cress of Dalesburg

The services of Mr William Terence Keogh as acting consul _pro
tem_ were suggested and accepted and Johnny sailed with the
Hemstetters back to his native shores

Keogh slipped into the sinecure of the American consulship with
the ease that never left him even in such high places The tintype
establishment was soon to become a thing of the past although its
deadly work along the peaceful and helpless Spanish Main was never
effaced The restless partners were about to be off again scouting
ahead of the slow ranks of Fortune But now they would take different
ways There were rumours of a promising uprising in Peru and thither
the martial Clancy would turn his adventurous steps As for Keogh he
was figuring in his mind and on quires of Government letterheads a
scheme that dwarfed the art of misrepresenting the human countenance
upon tin

What suits me Keogh used to say in the way of a business
proposition is something diversified that looks like a longer shot
than it issomething in the way of a genteel graft that isnt worked
enough for the correspondence schools to be teaching it by mail I
take the long end but I like to have at least as good a chance to
win as a man learning to play poker on an ocean steamer or running
for governor of Texas on the Republican ticket And when I cash in my
winnings I dont want to find any widows and orphans chips in my
stack

The grassgrown globe was the green table on which Keogh gambled The
games he played were of his own invention He was no grubber after
the diffident dollar Nor did he care to follow it with horn and
hounds Rather he loved to coax it with egregious and brilliant flies
from its habitat in the waters of strange streams Yet Keogh was a
business man and his schemes in spite of their singularity were as
solidly set as the plans of a building contractor In Arthurs time
Sir William Keogh would have been a Knight of the Round Table In
these modern days he rides abroad seeking the Graft instead of the
Grail

Three days after Johnnys departure two small schooners appeared
off Coralio After some delay a boat put off from one of them and
brought a sunburned young man ashore This young man had a shrewd and
calculating eye and he gazed with amazement at the strange things
that he saw He found on the beach some one who directed him to the
consuls office and thither he made his way at a nervous gait

Keogh was sprawled in the official chair drawing caricatures of
his Uncles head on an official pad of paper He looked up at his
visitor

Wheres Johnny Atwood inquired the sunburned young man in a
business tone

Gone said Keogh working carefully at Uncle Sams necktie

Thats just like him remarked the nutbrown one leaning against
the table He always was a fellow to gallivant around instead of
tending to business Will he be in soon

Dont think so said Keogh after a fair amount of deliberation

I spose hes out at some of his tomfoolery conjectured the
visitor in a tone of virtuous conviction Johnny never would stick
to anything long enough to succeed I wonder how he manages to run
his business here and never be round to look after it

Im looking after the business just now admitted the _pro tem_
consul

Are youthen saywheres the factory

What factory asked Keogh with a mildly polite interest

Why the factory where they use them cockleburrs Lord knows what
they use em for anyway Ive got the basements of both them ships
out there loaded with em Ill give you a bargain in this lot Ive
had every man woman and child around Dalesburg that wasnt busy
pickin em for a month I hired these ships to bring em over
Everybody thought I was crazy Now you can have this lot for fifteen
cents a pound delivered on land And if you want more I guess old
Alabam can come up to the demand Johnny told me when he left home
that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in hed
let me in on it Shall I drive the ships in and hitch

A look of supreme almost incredulous delight dawned in Keoghs
ruddy countenance He dropped his pencil His eyes turned upon the
sunburned young man with joy in them mingled with fear lest his
ecstasy should prove a dream

For Gods sake tell me said Keogh earnestly are you Dink
Pawson

My name is Pinkney Dawson said the cornerer of the cockleburr
market

Billy Keogh slid rapturously and gently from his chair to his
favourite strip of matting on the floor

There were not many sounds in Coralio on that sultry afternoon
Among those that were may be mentioned a noise of enraptured and
unrighteous laughter from a prostrate IrishAmerican while a
sunburned young man with a shrewd eye looked on him with wonder and
amazement Also the tramp tramp tramp of many wellshod feet in
the streets outside Also the lonesome wash of the waves that beat
along the historic shores of the Spanish Main

MASTERS OF ARTS


A twoinch stub of a blue pencil was the wand with which Keogh
performed the preliminary acts of his magic So with this he covered
paper with diagrams and figures while he waited for the United States
of America to send down to Coralio a successor to Atwood resigned

The new scheme that his mind had conceived his stout heart indorsed
and his blue pencil corroborated was laid around the characteristics
and human frailties of the new president of Anchuria These
characteristics and the situation out of which Keogh hoped to wrest
a golden tribute deserve chronicling contributive to the clear order
of events

President Losadamany called him Dictatorwas a man whose genius
would have made him conspicuous even among AngloSaxons had not
that genius been intermixed with other traits that were petty and
subversive He had some of the lofty patriotism of Washington the
man he most admired the force of Napoleon and much of the wisdom
of the sages These characteristics might have justified him in the
assumption of the title of The Illustrious Liberator had they not
been accompanied by a stupendous and amazing vanity that kept him in
the less worthy ranks of the dictators

Yet he did his country great service With a mighty grasp he shook it
nearly free from the shackles of ignorance and sloth and the vermin
that fed upon it and all but made it a power in the council of
nations He established schools and hospitals built roads bridges
railroads and palaces and bestowed generous subsidies upon the arts
and sciences He was the absolute despot and the idol of his people
The wealth of the country poured into his hands Other presidents had
been rapacious without reason Losada amassed enormous wealth but
his people had their share of the benefits

The joint in his armour was his insatiate passion for monuments and
tokens commemorating his glory In every town he caused to be erected
statues of himself bearing legends in praise of his greatness In
the walls of every public edifice tablets were fixed reciting his
splendour and the gratitude of his subjects His statuettes and
portraits were scattered throughout the land in every house and hut
One of the sycophants in his court painted him as St John with a
halo and a train of attendants in full uniform Losada saw nothing
incongruous in this picture and had it hung in a church in the
capital He ordered from a French sculptor a marble group including
himself with Napoleon Alexander the Great and one or two others
whom he deemed worthy of the honour

He ransacked Europe for decorations employing policy money and
intrigue to cajole the orders he coveted from kings and rulers On
state occasions his breast was covered from shoulder to shoulder with
crosses stars golden roses medals and ribbons It was said that
the man who could contrive for him a new decoration or invent some
new method of extolling his greatness might plunge a hand deep into
the treasury

This was the man upon whom Billy Keogh had his eye The gentle
buccaneer had observed the rain of favors that fell upon those who
ministered to the presidents vanities and he did not deem it his
duty to hoist his umbrella against the scattering drops of liquid
fortune

In a few weeks the new consul arrived releasing Keogh from his
temporary duties He was a young man fresh from college who lived
for botany alone The consulate at Coralio gave him the opportunity
to study tropical flora He wore smoked glasses and carried a green
umbrella He filled the cool back porch of the consulate with plants
and specimens so that space for a bottle and chair was not to be
found Keogh gazed on him sadly but without rancour and began to
pack his gripsack For his new plot against stagnation along the
Spanish Main required of him a voyage overseas

Soon came the _Karlsefin_ againshe of the trampish habitsgleaning
a cargo of cocoanuts for a speculative descent upon the New York
market Keogh was booked for a passage on the return trip

Yes Im going to New York he explained to the group of his
countrymen that had gathered on the beach to see him off But Ill
be back before you miss me Ive undertaken the art education of this
piebald country and Im not the man to desert it while its in the
early throes of tintypes

With this mysterious declaration of his intentions Keogh boarded the
_Karlsefin_

Ten days later shivering with the collar of his thin coat turned
high he burst into the studio of Carolus White at the top of a tall
building in Tenth Street New York City

Carolus White was smoking a cigarette and frying sausages over an oil
stove He was only twentythree and had noble theories about art

Billy Keogh exclaimed White extending the hand that was not busy
with the frying pan From what part of the uncivilized world I
wonder

Hello Carry said Keogh dragging forward a stool and holding his
fingers close to the stove Im glad I found you so soon Ive been
looking for you all day in the directories and art galleries The
freelunch man on the corner told me where you were quick I was
sure youd be painting pictures yet

Keogh glanced about the studio with the shrewd eye of a connoisseur
in business

Yes you can do it he declared with many gentle nods of his head
That big one in the corner with the angels and green clouds and
bandwagon is just the sort of thing we want What would you call
that Carryscene from Coney Island aint it

That said White I had intended to call The Translation of
Elijah but you may be nearer right than I am

Name doesnt matter said Keogh largely its the frame and the
varieties of paint that does the trick Now I can tell you in a
minute what I want Ive come on a little voyage of two thousand
miles to take you in with me on a scheme I thought of you as soon as
the scheme showed itself to me How would you like to go back with
me and paint a picture Ninety days for the trip and five thousand
dollars for the job

Cereal food or hairtonic posters asked White

It isnt an ad

What kind of a picture is it to be

Its a long story said Keogh

Go ahead with it If you dont mind while you talk Ill just keep
my eye on these sausages Let em get one shade deeper than a Vandyke
brown and you spoil em

Keogh explained his project They were to return to Coralio where
White was to pose as a distinguished American portrait painter who
was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and
remunerative professional labours It was not an unreasonable hope
even to those who had trod in the beaten paths of business that an
artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate
upon canvas the lineaments of the president and secure a share of
the _pesos_ that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses

Keogh had set his price at ten thousand dollars Artists had been
paid more for portraits He and White were to share the expenses of
the trip and divide the possible profits Thus he laid the scheme
before White whom he had known in the West before one declared for
Art and the other became a Bedouin

Before long the two machinators abandoned the rigour of the bare
studio for a snug corner of a cafe There they sat far into the
night with old envelopes and Keoghs stub of blue pencil between
them

At twelve oclock White doubled up in his chair with his chin on his
fist and shut his eyes at the unbeautiful wallpaper

Ill go you Billy he said in the quiet tones of decision Ive
got two or three hundred saved up for sausages and rent and Ill
take the chance with you Five thousand It will give me two years in
Paris and one in Italy Ill begin to pack tomorrow

Youll begin in ten minutes said Keogh Its tomorrow now The
_Karlsefin_ starts back at four PM Come on to your painting shop
and Ill help you

For five months in the year Coralio is the Newport of Anchuria
Then only does the town possess life From November to March it is
practically the seat of government The president with his official
family sojourns there and society follows him The pleasureloving
people make the season one long holiday of amusement and rejoicing
_Fiestas_ balls games sea bathing processions and small theatres
contribute to their enjoyment The famous Swiss band from the
capital plays in the little plaza every evening while the fourteen
carriages and vehicles in the town circle in funereal but complacent
procession Indians from the interior mountains looking like
prehistoric stone idols come down to peddle their handiwork in the
streets The people throng the narrow ways a chattering happy
careless stream of buoyant humanity Preposterous children rigged out
with the shortest of ballet skirts and gilt wings howl underfoot
among the effervescent crowds Especially is the arrival of the
presidential party at the opening of the season attended with pomp
show and patriotic demonstrations of enthusiasm and delight

When Keogh and White reached their destination on the return trip
of the _Karlsefin_ the gay winter season was well begun As they
stepped upon the beach they could hear the band playing in the plaza
The village maidens with fireflies already fixed in their dark
locks were gliding barefoot and coyeyed along the paths Dandies
in white linen swinging their canes were beginning their seductive
strolls The air was full of human essence of artificial enticement
of coquetry indolence pleasurethe manmade sense of existence

The first two or three days after their arrival were spent in
preliminaries Keogh escorted the artist about town introducing
him to the little circle of Englishspeaking residents and pulling
whatever wires he could to effect the spreading of Whites fame as a
painter And then Keogh planned a more spectacular demonstration of
the idea he wished to keep before the public

He and White engaged rooms in the Hotel de los Estranjeros The
two were clad in new suits of immaculate duck with American straw
hats and carried canes of remarkable uniqueness and inutility Few
caballeros in Coralioeven the gorgeously uniformed officers of
the Anchurian armywere as conspicuous for ease and elegance of
demeanour as Keogh and his friend the great American painter Senor
White

White set up his easel on the beach and made striking sketches of the
mountain and sea views The native population formed at his rear in a
vast chattering semicircle to watch his work Keogh with his care
for details had arranged for himself a pose which he carried out
with fidelity His role was that of friend to the great artist a
man of affairs and leisure The visible emblem of his position was a
pocket camera

For branding the man who owns it said he a genteel dilettante
with a bank account and an easy conscience a steamyacht aint in it
with a camera You see a man doing nothing but loafing around making
snapshots and you know right away he reads up well in Bradstreet
You notice these old millionaire boyssoon as they get through
taking everything else in sight they go to taking photographs
People are more impressed by a kodak than they are by a title or
a fourcarat scarfpin So Keogh strolled blandly about Coralio
snapping the scenery and the shrinking senoritas while White posed
conspicuously in the higher regions of art

Two weeks after their arrival the scheme began to bear fruit
An aidedecamp of the president drove to the hotel in a dashing
victoria The president desired that Senor White come to the Casa
Morena for an informal interview

Keogh gripped his pipe tightly between his teeth Not a cent less
than ten thousand he said to the artistremember the price
And in gold or its equivalentdont let him stick you with this
bargaincounter stuff they call money here

Perhaps it isnt that he wants said White

Get out said Keogh with splendid confidence I know what he
wants He wants his picture painted by the celebrated young American
painter and filibuster now sojourning in his downtrodden country
Off you go

The victoria sped away with the artist Keogh walked up and down
puffing great clouds of smoke from his pipe and waited In an hour
the victoria swept again to the door of the hotel deposited White
and vanished The artist dashed up the stairs three at a step Keogh
stopped smoking and became a silent interrogation point

Landed exclaimed White with his boyish face flushed with elation
Billy you are a wonder He wants a picture Ill tell you all about
it By Heavens that dictator chap is a corker Hes a dictator clear
down to his fingerends Hes a kind of combination of Julius Caesar
Lucifer and Chauncey Depew done in sepia Polite and grimthats his
way The room I saw him in was about ten acres big and looked like
a Mississippi steamboat with its gilding and mirrors and white paint
He talks English better than I can ever hope to The matter of the
price came up I mentioned ten thousand I expected him to call the
guard and have me taken out and shot He didnt move an eyelash He
just waved one of his chestnut hands in a careless way and said
Whatever you say I am to go back tomorrow and discuss with him
the details of the picture

Keogh hung his head Selfabasement was easy to read in his downcast
countenance

Im failing Carry he said sorrowfully Im not fit to handle
these manssize schemes any longer Peddling oranges in a pushcart
is about the suitable graft for me When I said ten thousand I
swear I thought I had sized up that brown mans limit to within
two cents Hed have melted down for fifteen thousand just as easy
SayCarryyoull see old man Keogh safe in some nice quiet idiot
asylum wont you if he makes a break like that again

The Casa Morena although only one story in height was a building of
brown stone luxurious as a palace in its interior It stood on a low
hill in a walled garden of splendid tropical flora at the upper edge
of Coralio The next day the presidents carriage came again for the
artist Keogh went out for a walk along the beach where he and his
picture box were now familiar sights When he returned to the hotel
White was sitting in a steamerchair on the balcony

Well said Keogh did you and His Nibs decide on the kind of a
chromo he wants

White got up and walked back and forth on the balcony a few times
Then he stopped and laughed strangely His face was flushed and his
eyes were bright with a kind of angry amusement

Look here Billy he said somewhat roughly when you first came
to me in my studio and mentioned a picture I thought you wanted a
Smashed Oats or a Hair Tonic poster painted on a range of mountains
or the side of a continent Well either of those jobs would have
been Art in its highest form compared to the one youve steered me
against I cant paint that picture Billy Youve got to let me
out Let me try to tell you what that barbarian wants He had it
all planned out and even a sketch made of his idea The old boy
doesnt draw badly at all But ye goddesses of Art listen to the
monstrosity he expects me to paint He wants himself in the centre
of the canvas of course He is to be painted as Jupiter sitting
on Olympus with the clouds at his feet At one side of him stands
George Washington in full regimentals with his hand on the
presidents shoulder An angel with outstretched wings hovers
overhead and is placing a laurel wreath on the presidents head
crowning himQueen of the May I suppose In the background is to
be cannon more angels and soldiers The man who would paint that
picture would have to have the soul of a dog and would deserve to go
down into oblivion without even a tin can tied to his tail to sound
his memory

Little beads of moisture crept out all over Billy Keoghs brow The
stub of his blue pencil had not figured out a contingency like this
The machinery of his plan had run with flattering smoothness until
now He dragged another chair upon the balcony and got White back to
his seat He lit his pipe with apparent calm

Now sonny he said with gentle grimness you and me will have
an Art to Art talk Youve got your art and Ive got mine Yours is
the real Pierian stuff that turns up its nose at bockbeer signs and
oleographs of the Old Mill Mines the art of Business This was my
scheme and it worked out like twoandtwo Paint that president man
as Old King Cole or Venus or a landscape or a fresco or a bunch
of lilies or anything he thinks he looks like But get the paint on
the canvas and collect the spoils You wouldnt throw me down Carry
at this stage of the game Think of that ten thousand

I cant help thinking of it said White and thats what hurts
Im tempted to throw every ideal I ever had down in the mire and
steep my soul in infamy by painting that picture That five thousand
meant three years of foreign study to me and Id almost sell my soul
for that

Now it aint as bad as that said Keogh soothingly Its a
business proposition Its so much paint and time against money I
dont fall in with your idea that that picture would so everlastingly
jolt the art side of the question George Washington was all right
you know and nobody could say a word against the angel I dont
think so bad of that group If you was to give Jupiter a pair of
epaulets and a sword and kind of work the clouds around to look
like a blackberry patch it wouldnt make such a bad battle scene
Why if we hadnt already settled on the price he ought to pay an
extra thousand for Washington and the angel ought to raise it five
hundred

You dont understand Billy said White with an uneasy laugh
Some of us fellows who try to paint have big notions about Art I
wanted to paint a picture some day that people would stand before and
forget that it was made of paint I wanted it to creep into them like
a bar of music and mushroom there like a soft bullet And I wanted
em to go away and ask What else has he done And I didnt want
em to find a thing not a portrait nor a magazine cover nor an
illustration nor a drawing of a girlnothing but _the_ picture
Thats why Ive lived on fried sausages and tried to keep true
to myself I persuaded myself to do this portrait for the chance
it might give me to study abroad But this howling screaming
caricature Good Lord cant you see how it is

Sure said Keogh as tenderly as he would have spoken to a child
and he laid a long forefinger on Whites knee I see Its bad to
have your art all slugged up like that I know You wanted to paint a
big thing like the panorama of the battle of Gettysburg But let me
kalsomine you a little mental sketch to consider Up to date were
out 38550 on this scheme Our capital took every cent both of us
could raise Weve got about enough left to get back to New York on
I need my share of that ten thousand I want to work a copper deal
in Idaho and make a hundred thousand Thats the business end of
the thing Come down off your art perch Carry and lets land that
hatful of dollars

Billy said White with an effort Ill try I wont say Ill do
it but Ill try Ill go at it and put it through if I can

Thats business said Keogh heartily Good boy Now heres
another thingrush that picturecrowd it through as quick as you
can Get a couple of boys to help you mix the paint if necessary
Ive picked up some pointers around town The people here are
beginning to get sick of Mr President They say hes been too free
with concessions and they accuse him of trying to make a dicker with
England to sell out the country We want that picture done and paid
for before theres any row

In the great _patio_ of Casa Morena the president caused to be
stretched a huge canvas Under this White set up his temporary
studio For two hours each day the great man sat to him

White worked faithfully But as the work progressed he had seasons
of bitter scorn of infinite selfcontempt of sullen gloom and
sardonic gaiety Keogh with the patience of a great general
soothed coaxed arguedkept him at the picture

At the end of a month White announced that the picture was
completedJupiter Washington angels clouds cannon and all His
face was pale and his mouth drawn straight when he told Keogh He
said the president was much pleased with it It was to be hung in
the National Gallery of Statesmen and Heroes The artist had been
requested to return to Casa Morena on the following day to receive
payment At the appointed time he left the hotel silent under his
friends joyful talk of their success

An hour later he walked into the room where Keogh was waiting threw
his hat on the floor and sat upon the table

Billy he said in strained and labouring tones Ive a little
money out West in a small business that my brother is running Its
what Ive been living on while Ive been studying art Ill draw out
my share and pay you back what youve lost on this scheme

Lost exclaimed Keogh jumping up Didnt you get paid for the
picture

Yes I got paid said White But just now there isnt any picture
and there isnt any pay If you care to hear about it here are the
edifying details The president and I were looking at the painting
His secretary brought a bank draft on New York for ten thousand
dollars and handed it to me The moment I touched it I went wild I
tore it into little pieces and threw them on the floor A workman
was repainting the pillars inside the _patio_ A bucket of his paint
happened to be convenient I picked up his brush and slapped a quart
of blue paint all over that tenthousanddollar nightmare I bowed
and walked out The president didnt move or speak That was one time
he was taken by surprise Its tough on you Billy but I couldnt
help it

There seemed to be excitement in Coralio Outside there was a
confused rising murmur pierced by highpitched cries _Bajo el
traidorMuerte el traidor_ were the words they seemed to form

Listen to that exclaimed White bitterly I know that much
Spanish Theyre shouting Down with the traitor I heard them
before I felt that they meant me I was a traitor to Art The
picture had to go

Down with the blank fool would have suited your case better said
Keogh with fiery emphasis You tear up ten thousand dollars like an
old rag because the way youve spread on five dollars worth of paint
hurts your conscience Next time I pick a sidepartner in a scheme
the man has got to go before a notary and swear he never even heard
the word ideal mentioned

Keogh strode from the room whitehot White paid little attention
to his resentment The scorn of Billy Keogh seemed a trifling thing
beside the greater selfscorn he had escaped

In Coralio the excitement waxed An outburst was imminent The cause
of this demonstration of displeasure was the presence in the town of
a big pinkcheeked Englishman who it was said was an agent of his
government come to clinch the bargain by which the president placed
his people in the hands of a foreign power It was charged that not
only had he given away priceless concessions but that the public
debt was to be transferred into the hands of the English and the
customhouses turned over to them as a guarantee The longenduring
people had determined to make their protest felt

On that night in Coralio and in other towns their ire found vent
Yelling mobs mercurial but dangerous roamed the streets They
overthrew the great bronze statue of the president that stood in the
centre of the plaza and hacked it to shapeless pieces They tore
from public buildings the tablets set there proclaiming the glory
of the Illustrious Liberator His pictures in the government
offices were demolished The mobs even attacked the Casa Morena but
were driven away by the military which remained faithful to the
executive All the night terror reigned

The greatness of Losada was shown by the fact that by noon the
next day order was restored and he was still absolute He issued
proclamations denying positively that any negotiations of any
kind had been entered into with England Sir Stafford Vaughn the
pinkcheeked Englishman also declared in placards and in public
print that his presence there had no international significance He
was a traveller without guile In fact so he stated he had not
even spoken with the president or been in his presence since his
arrival

During this disturbance White was preparing for his homeward voyage
in the steamship that was to sail within two or three days About
noon Keogh the restless took his camera out with the hope of
speeding the lagging hours The town was now as quiet as if peace had
never departed from her perch on the redtiled roofs

About the middle of the afternoon Keogh hurried back to the hotel
with something decidedly special in his air He retired to the little
room where he developed his pictures

Later on he came out to White on the balcony with a luminous grim
predatory smile on his face

Do you know what that is he asked holding up a 4 x 5 photograph
mounted on cardboard

Snapshot of a senorita sitting in the sandalliteration
unintentional guessed White lazily

Wrong said Keogh with shining eyes Its a slungshot Its a can
of dynamite Its a gold mine Its a sightdraft on your president
man for twenty thousand dollarsyes sirtwenty thousand this time
and no spoiling the picture No ethics of art in the way Art You
with your smelly little tubes Ive got you skinned to death with a
kodak Take a look at that

White took the picture in his hand and gave a long whistle

Jove he exclaimed but wouldnt that stir up a row in town if you
let it be seen How in the world did you get it Billy

You know that high wall around the president mans back garden
I was up there trying to get a birdseye of the town I happened
to notice a chink in the wall where a stone and a lot of plaster
had slid out Thinks I Ill take a peep through to see how Mr
Presidents cabbages are growing The first thing I saw was him and
this Sir Englishman sitting at a little table about twenty feet away
They had the table all spread over with documents and they were
hobnobbing over them as thick as two pirates Twas a nice corner
of the garden all private and shady with palms and orange trees
and they had a pail of champagne set by handy in the grass I knew
then was the time for me to make my big hit in Art So I raised the
machine up to the crack and pressed the button Just as I did so
them old boys shook hands on the dealyou see they took that way in
the picture

Keogh put on his coat and hat

What are you going to do with it asked White

Me said Keogh in a hurt tone why Im going to tie a pink ribbon
to it and hang it on the whatnot of course Im surprised at
you But while Im out you just try to figure out what gingercake
potentate would be most likely to want to buy this work of art for
his private collectionjust to keep it out of circulation

The sunset was reddening the tops of the cocoanut palms when
Billy Keogh came back from Casa Morena He nodded to the artists
questioning gaze and lay down on a cot with his hands under the back
of his head

I saw him He paid the money like a little man They didnt want to
let me in at first I told em it was important Yes that president
man is on the plentyable list Hes got a beautiful business system
about the way he uses his brains All I had to do was to hold
up the photograph so he could see it and name the price He
just smiled and walked over to a safe and got the cash Twenty
onethousanddollar brandnew United States Treasury notes he laid
on the table like Id pay out a dollar and a quarter Fine notes
toothey crackled with a sound like burning the brush off a tenacre
lot

Lets try the feel of one said White curiously I never saw a
thousanddollar bill Keogh did not immediately respond

Carry he said in an absentminded way you think a heap of your
art dont you

More said White frankly than has been for the financial good of
myself and my friends

I thought you were a fool the other day went on Keogh quietly
and Im not sure now that you wasnt But if you was so am I Ive
been in some funny deals Carry but Ive always managed to scramble
fair and match my brains and capital against the other fellows But
when it comes towell when youve got the other fellow cinched
and the screws on him and hes got to put upwhy it dont strike
me as being a mans game Theyve got a name for it you know
itsconfound you dont you understand A fellow feelsits
something like that blamed art of yourshewell I tore that
photograph up and laid the pieces on that stack of money and shoved
the whole business back across the table Excuse me Mr Losada
I said but I guess Ive made a mistake in the price You get the
photo for nothing Now Carry you get out the pencil and well do
some more figuring Id like to save enough out of our capital for
you to have some fried sausages in your joint when you get back to
New York

DICKY


There is little consecutiveness along the Spanish Main Things happen
there intermittently Even Time seems to hang his scythe daily on the
branch of an orange tree while he takes a siesta and a cigarette

After the ineffectual revolt against the administration of President
Losada the country settled again into quiet toleration of the abuses
with which he had been charged In Coralio old political enemies
went arminarm lightly eschewing for the time all differences of
opinion

The failure of the art expedition did not stretch the catfooted
Keogh upon his back The ups and downs of Fortune made smooth
travelling for his nimble steps His blue pencil stub was at work
again before the smoke of the steamer on which White sailed had
cleared away from the horizon He had but to speak a word to Geddie
to find his credit negotiable for whatever goods he wanted from the
store of Brannigan  Company On the same day on which White arrived
in New York Keogh at the rear of a train of five pack mules loaded
with hardware and cutlery set his face toward the grim interior
mountains There the Indian tribes wash gold dust from the auriferous
streams and when a market is brought to them trading is brisk and
_muy bueno_ in the Cordilleras

In Coralio Time folded his wings and paced wearily along his drowsy
path They who had most cheered the torpid hours were gone Clancy
had sailed on a Spanish barque for Colon contemplating a cut across
the isthmus and then a further voyage to end at Calao where the
fighting was said to be on Geddie whose quiet and genial nature had
once served to mitigate the frequent dull reaction of lotus eating
was now a homeman happy with his bright orchid Paula and never
even dreaming of or regretting the unsolved sealed and monogramed
Bottle whose contents now inconsiderable were held safely in the
keeping of the sea

Well may the Walrus most discerning and eclectic of beasts place
sealingwax midway on his programme of topics that fall pertinent and
diverting upon the ear

Atwood was gonehe of the hospitable back porch and ingenuous
cunning Dr Gregg with his trepanning story smouldering within him
was a whiskered volcano always showing signs of imminent eruption
and was not to be considered in the ranks of those who might
contribute to the amelioration of ennui The new consuls note chimed
with the sad sea waves and the violent tropical greenshe had not a
bar of Scheherezade or of the Round Table in his lute Goodwin was
employed with large projects what time he was loosed from them found
him at his home where he loved to be Therefore it will be seen that
there was a dearth of fellowship and entertainment among the foreign
contingent of Coralio

And then Dicky Maloney dropped down from the clouds upon the town
and amused it

Nobody knew where Dicky Maloney hailed from or how he reached
Coralio He appeared there one day and that was all He afterward
said that he came on the fruit steamer _Thor_ but an inspection of
the _Thors_ passenger list of that date was found to be Maloneyless
Curiosity however soon perished and Dicky took his place among the
odd fish cast up by the Caribbean

He was an active devilmaycare rollicking fellow with an engaging
gray eye the most irresistible grin a rather dark or much sunburned
complexion and a head of the fieriest red hair ever seen in that
country Speaking the Spanish language as well as he spoke English
and seeming always to have plenty of silver in his pockets it was
not long before he was a welcome companion whithersoever he went He
had an extreme fondness for _vino blanco_ and gained the reputation
of being able to drink more of it than any three men in town
Everybody called him Dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of
himespecially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his
freeandeasy style were a constant delight and envy Wherever you
went in the town you would soon see Dicky or hear his genial laugh
and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for
his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy

A considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of
his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small
shop for the sale of tobacco _dulces_ and the handiwork of the
interior Indiansfibreandsilkwoven goods deerskin _zapatos_ and
basketwork of _tule_ reeds Even then he did not change his habits
for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the
_comandante_ the collector of customs the _Jefe Politico_ and other
gay dogs among the native officials

One day Dicky saw Pasa the daughter of Madama Ortiz sitting in the
sidedoor of the Hotel de los Estranjeros He stopped in his tracks
still for the first time in Coralio and then he sped swift as a
deer to find Vasquez a gilded native youth to present him

The young men had named Pasa _La Santita Naranjadita_
_Naranjadita_ is a Spanish word for a certain colour that you must go
to more trouble to describe in English By saying The little saint
tinted the most beautifuldelicateslightlyorangegolden you will
approximate the description of Madama Ortizs daughter

La Madama Ortiz sold rum in addition to other liquors Now you must
know that the rum expiates whatever opprobrium attends upon the other
commodities For rummaking mind you is a government monopoly
and to keep a government dispensary assures respectability if not
preeminence Moreover the saddest of precisians could find no fault
with the conduct of the shop Customers drank there in the lowest of
spirits and fearsomely as in the shadow of the dead for Madamas
ancient and vaunted lineage counteracted even the rums behest to be
merry For was she not of the Iglesias who landed with Pizarro And
had not her deceased husband been _comisionado de caminos y puentes_
for the district

In the evenings Pasa sat by the window in the room next to the one
where they drank and strummed dreamily upon her guitar And then
by twos and threes would come visiting young caballeros and occupy
the prim line of chairs set against the wall of this room They were
there to besiege the heart of _La Santita_ Their method which is
not proof against intelligent competition consisted of expanding the
chest looking valorous and consuming a gross or two of cigarettes
Even saints delicately oranged prefer to be wooed differently

Dona Pasa would tide over the vast chasms of nicotinized silence
with music from her guitar while she wondered if the romances she
had read about gallant and moremore contiguous cavaliers were all
lies At somewhat regular intervals Madama would glide in from the
dispensary with a sort of droughtsuggesting gleam in her eye and
there would be a rustling of stifflystarched white trousers as one
of the caballeros would propose an adjournment to the bar

That Dicky Maloney would sooner or later explore this field was a
thing to be foreseen There were few doors in Coralio into which his
red head had not been poked

In an incredibly short space of time after his first sight of her
he was there seated close beside her rocking chair There were no
backagainstthewall poses in Dickys theory of wooing His plan of
subjection was an attack at close range To carry the fortress with
one concentrated ardent eloquent irresistible _escalade_that was
Dickys way

Pasa was descended from the proudest Spanish families in the country
Moreover she had had unusual advantages Two years in a New Orleans
school had elevated her ambitions and fitted her for a fate above the
ordinary maidens of her native land And yet here she succumbed to
the first redhaired scamp with a glib tongue and a charming smile
that came along and courted her properly

Very soon Dicky took her to the little church on the corner of the
plaza and Mrs Maloney was added to her string of distinguished
names

And it was her fate to sit with her patient saintly eyes and figure
like a bisque Psyche behind the sequestered counter of the little
shop while Dicky drank and philandered with his frivolous
acquaintances

The women with their naturally fine instinct saw a chance for
vivisection and delicately taunted her with his habits She turned
upon them in a beautiful steady blaze of sorrowful contempt

You meatcows she said in her level crystalclear tones you
know nothing of a man Your men are _maromeros_ They are fit only to
roll cigarettes in the shade until the sun strikes and shrivels them
up They drone in your hammocks and you comb their hair and feed
them with fresh fruit My man is of no such blood Let him drink of
the wine When he has taken sufficient of it to drown one of your
_flaccitos_ he will come home to me more of a man than one thousand
of your _pobrecitos_ _My_ hair he smooths and braids to me he
sings he himself removes my _zapatos_ and there there upon each
instep leaves a kiss He holds Oh you will never understand Blind
ones who have never known a _man_

Sometimes mysterious things happened at night about Dickys shop
While the front of it was dark in the little room back of it Dicky
and a few of his friends would sit about a table carrying on some
kind of very quiet _negocios_ until quite late Finally he would let
them out the front door very carefully and go upstairs to his little
saint These visitors were generally conspiratorlike men with dark
clothes and hats Of course these dark doings were noticed after a
while and talked about

Dicky seemed to care nothing at all for the society of the alien
residents of the town He avoided Goodwin and his skilful escape
from the trepanning story of Dr Gregg is still referred to in
Coralio as a masterpiece of lightning diplomacy

Many letters arrived addressed to Mr Dicky Maloney or Senor
Dickee Maloney to the considerable pride of Pasa That so many
people should desire to write to him only confirmed her own suspicion
that the light from his red head shone around the world As to their
contents she never felt curiosity There was a wife for you

The one mistake Dicky made in Coralio was to run out of money at the
wrong time Where his money came from was a puzzle for the sales
of his shop were next to nothing but that source failed and at a
peculiarly unfortunate time It was when the _comandante_ Don Senor
el Coronel Encarnacion Rios looked upon the little saint seated in
the shop and felt his heart go pitapat

The _comandante_ who was versed in all the intricate arts of
gallantry first delicately hinted at his sentiments by donning his
dress uniform and strutting up and down fiercely before her window
Pasa glancing demurely with her saintly eyes instantly perceived
his resemblance to her parrot Chichi and was diverted to the extent
of a smile The _comandante_ saw the smile which was not intended
for him Convinced of an impression made he entered the shop
confidently and advanced to open compliment Pasa froze he pranced
she flamed royally he was charmed to injudicious persistence she
commanded him to leave the shop he tried to capture her handand
Dicky entered smiling broadly full of white wine and the devil

He spent five minutes in punishing the _comandante_ scientifically
and carefully so that the pain might be prolonged as far as
possible At the end of that time he pitched the rash wooer out the
door upon the stones of the street senseless

A barefooted policeman who had been watching the affair from across
the street blew a whistle A squad of four soldiers came running from
the _cuartel_ around the corner When they saw that the offender
was Dicky they stopped and blew more whistles which brought out
reenforcements of eight Deeming the odds against them sufficiently
reduced the military advanced upon the disturber

Dicky being thoroughly imbued with the martial spirit stooped
and drew the _comandantes_ sword which was girded about him and
charged his foe He chased the standing army four squares playfully
prodding its squealing rear and hacking at its gingercoloured heels

But he was not so successful with the civic authorities Six
muscular nimble policemen overpowered him and conveyed him
triumphantly but warily to jail _El Diablo Colorado_ they dubbed
him and derided the military for its defeat

Dicky with the rest of the prisoners could look out through
the barred door at the grass of the little plaza at a row of
orange trees and the red tile roofs and dobe walls of a line of
insignificant stores

At sunset along a path across this plaza came a melancholy procession
of sadfaced women bearing plantains cassaba bread and fruiteach
coming with food to some wretch behind those bars to whom she still
clung and furnished the means of life Twice a daymorning and
eveningthey were permitted to come Water was furnished to her
compulsory guests by the republic but no food

That evening Dickys name was called by the sentry and he stepped
before the bars of the door There stood his little saint a black
mantilla draped about her head and shoulders her face like glorified
melancholy her clear eyes gazing longingly at him as if they might
draw him between the bars to her She brought a chicken some
oranges _dulces_ and a loaf of white bread A soldier inspected the
food and passed it in to Dicky Pasa spoke calmly as she always
did briefly in her thrilling flutelike tones Angel of my life
she said let it not be long that thou art away from me Thou
knowest that life is not a thing to be endured with thou not at
my side Tell me if I can do aught in this matter If not I will
waita little while I come again in the morning

Dicky with his shoes removed so as not to disturb his fellow
prisoners tramped the floor of the jail half the night condemning
his lack of money and the cause of itwhatever that might have been
He knew very well that money would have bought his release at once

For two days succeeding Pasa came at the appointed times and brought
him food He eagerly inquired each time if a letter or package had
come for him and she mournfully shook her head

On the morning of the third day she brought only a small loaf of
bread There were dark circles under her eyes She seemed as calm as
ever

By jingo said Dicky who seemed to speak in English or Spanish as
the whim seized him this is dry provender _muchachita_ Is this
the best you can dig up for a fellow

Pasa looked at him as a mother looks at a beloved but capricious
babe

Think better of it she said in a low voice since for the next
meal there will be nothing The last _centavo_ is spent She pressed
closer against the grating

Sell the goods in the shoptake anything for them

Have I not tried Did I not offer them for onetenth their cost Not
even one _peso_ would any one give There is not one _real_ in this
town to assist Dickee Malonee

Dick clenched his teeth grimly Thats the _comandante_ he
growled Hes responsible for that sentiment Wait oh wait till
the cards are all out

Pasa lowered her voice to almost a whisper And listen heart of my
heart she said I have endeavoured to be brave but I cannot live
without thee Three days now

Dicky caught a faint gleam of steel from the folds of her mantilla
For once she looked in his face and saw it without a smile stern
menacing and purposeful Then he suddenly raised his hand and his
smile came back like a gleam of sunshine The hoarse signal of an
incoming steamers siren sounded in the harbour Dicky called to the
sentry who was pacing before the door What steamer comes

The _Catarina_

Of the Vesuvius line

Without doubt of that line

Go you _picarilla_ said Dicky joyously to Pasa to the American
consul Tell him I wish to speak with him See that he comes at
once And look you let me see a different look in those eyes for I
promise your head shall rest upon this arm tonight

It was an hour before the consul came He held his green umbrella
under his arm and mopped his forehead impatiently

Now see here Maloney he began captiously you fellows seem to
think you can cut up any kind of row and expect me to pull you out
of it Im neither the War Department nor a gold mine This country
has its laws you know and theres one against pounding the senses
out of the regular army You Irish are forever getting into trouble
I dont see what I can do Anything like tobacco now to make you
comfortableor newspapers

Son of Eli interrupted Dicky gravely you havent changed an
iota That is almost a duplicate of the speech you made when old
Koens donkeys and geese got into the chapel loft and the culprits
wanted to hide in your room

Oh heavens exclaimed the consul hurriedly adjusting his
spectacles Are you a Yale man too Were you in that crowd I dont
seem to remember any one with redany one named Maloney Such a lot
of college men seem to have misused their advantages One of the best
mathematicians of the class of 91 is selling lottery tickets in
Belize A Cornell man dropped off here last month He was second
steward on a guano boat Ill write to the department if you like
Maloney Or if theres any tobacco or newspa

Theres nothing interrupted Dicky shortly but this You go tell
the captain of the _Catarina_ that Dicky Maloney wants to see him as
soon as he can conveniently come Tell him where I am Hurry Thats
all

The consul glad to be let off so easily hurried away The captain
of the _Catarina_ a stout man Sicilian born soon appeared
shoving with little ceremony through the guards to the jail door
The Vesuvius Fruit Company had a habit of doing things that way in
Anchuria

I am exceedingly sorryexceedingly sorry said the captain to
see this occur I place myself at your service Mr Maloney What you
need shall be furnished Whatever you say shall be done

Dicky looked at him unsmilingly His red hair could not detract from
his attitude of severe dignity as he stood tall and calm with his
now grim mouth forming a horizontal line

Captain De Lucco I believe I still have funds in the hands of your
companyample and personal funds I ordered a remittance last week
The money has not arrived You know what is needed in this game
Money and money and more money Why has it not been sent

By the _Cristobal_ replied De Lucco gesticulating it was
despatched Where is the _Cristobal_ Off Cape Antonio I spoke her
with a broken shaft A tramp coaster was towing her back to New
Orleans I brought money ashore thinking your need for it might not
withstand delay In this envelope is one thousand dollars There is
more if you need it Mr Maloney

For the present it will suffice said Dicky softening as he
crinkled the envelope and looked down at the halfinch thickness of
smooth dingy bills

The long green he said gently with a new reverence in his gaze
Is there anything it will not buy Captain

I had three friends replied De Lucco who was a bit of a
philosopher who had money One of them speculated in stocks and
made ten million another is in heaven and the third married a poor
girl whom he loved

The answer then said Dicky is held by the Almighty Wall Street
and Cupid So the question remains

This queried the captain including Dickys surroundings in
a significant gesture of his hand is itit is notit is not
connected with the business of your little shop There is no failure
in your plans

No no said Dicky This is merely the result of a little private
affair of mine a digression from the regular line of business They
say for a complete life a man must know poverty love and war But
they dont go well together _capitan mio_ No there is no failure
in my business The little shop is doing very well

When the captain had departed Dicky called the sergeant of the jail
squad and asked

Am I _preso_ by the military or by the civil authority

Surely there is no martial law in effect now senor

_Bueno_ Now go or send to the alcalde the _Jues de la Paz_ and the
_Jefe de los Policios_ Tell them I am prepared at once to satisfy
the demands of justice A folded bill of the long green slid into
the sergeants hand

Then Dickys smile came back again for he knew that the hours of his
captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentrys
tread


 _Theyre hanging men and women now
 For lacking of the green_


So that night Dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop
and his little saint sat close by working at something silken and
dainty Dicky was thoughtful and grave His red hair was in an
unusual state of disorder Pasas fingers often ached to smooth and
arrange it but Dicky would never allow it He was poring tonight
over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until
that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed
Pasa Presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until
he looked up inquiringly

It is sad for you here she explained Go out and drink _vino
blanco_ Come back when you get that smile you used to wear That is
what I wish to see

Dicky laughed and threw down his papers The _vino blanco_ stage
is past It has served its turn Perhaps after all there was less
entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought But there
will be no more maps or frowns tonight I promise you that Come

They sat upon a reed _silleta_ at the window and watched the
quivering gleams from the lights of the _Catarina_ reflected in the
harbour

Presently Pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible
laughter

I was thinking she began anticipating Dickys question of the
foolish things girls have in their minds Because I went to school
in the States I used to have ambitions Nothing less than to be the
presidents wife would satisfy me And look thou red picaroon to
what obscure fate thou hast stolen me

Dont give up hope said Dicky smiling More than one Irishman
has been the ruler of a South American country There was a dictator
of Chili named OHiggins Why not a President Maloney of Anchuria
Say the word _santita mia_ and well make the race

No no no thou redhaired reckless one sighed Pasa I am
contentshe laid her head against his armhere




XVI

ROUGE ET NOIR


It has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of
Losada to the presidency This feeling continued to grow Throughout
the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen
discontent Even the old Liberal party to which Goodwin Zavalla and
other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed Losada had failed
to become a popular idol Fresh taxes fresh import duties and more
than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by
the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since
the despicable Alforan The majority of his own cabinet were out
of sympathy with him The army which he had courted by giving it
license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate
support

But the most impolitic of the administrations moves had been when it
antagonized the Vesuvius Fruit Company an organization plying twelve
steamers and with a cash capital somewhat larger than Anchurias
surplus and debt combined

Reasonably an established concern like the Vesuvius would become
irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all
attempt to squeeze it So when the government proxies applied for
a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal The president at once
retaliated by clapping an export duty of one _real_ per bunch on
bananasa thing unprecedented in fruitgrowing countries The
Vesuvius Company had invested large sums in wharves and plantations
along the Anchurian coast their agents had erected fine homes in the
towns where they had their headquarters and heretofore had worked
with the republic in goodwill and with advantage to both It would
lose an immense sum if compelled to move out The selling price
of bananas from Vera Cruz to Trinidad was three _reals_ per bunch
This new duty of one _real_ would have ruined the fruit growers in
Anchuria and have seriously discommoded the Vesuvius Company had it
declined to pay it But for some reason the Vesuvius continued to
buy Anchurian fruit paying four _reals_ for it and not suffering
the growers to bear the loss

This apparent victory deceived His Excellency and he began to hunger
for more of it He sent an emissary to request a conference with a
representative of the fruit company The Vesuvius sent Mr Franzoni
a little stout cheerful man always cool and whistling airs from
Verdis operas Senor Espirition of the office of the Minister of
Finance attempted the sandbagging in behalf of Anchuria The meeting
took place in the cabin of the _Salvador_ of the Vesuvius line

Senor Espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the
government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the
alluvial coast lands After touching upon the benefits such a road
would confer upon the interests of the Vesuvius he reached the
definite suggestion that a contribution to the roads expenses of
say fifty thousand _pesos_ would not be more than an equivalent to
benefits received

Mr Franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits
from a contemplated road As its representative he must decline
to contribute fifty thousand _pesos_ But he would assume the
responsibility of offering twentyfive

Did Senor Espirition understand Senor Franzoni to mean twentyfive
thousand _pesos_

By no means Twentyfive _pesos_ And in silver not in gold

Your offer insults my government cried Senor Espirition rising
with indignation

Then said Mr Franzoni in warning tone _we will change it_

The offer was never changed Could Mr Franzoni have meant the
government

This was the state of affairs in Anchuria when the winter season
opened at Coralio at the end of the second year of Losadas
administration So when the government and society made its annual
exodus to the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent
would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing The tenth of November
was the day set for the entrance into Coralio of the gay company
from the capital A narrowgauge railroad runs twenty miles into the
interior from Solitas The government party travels by carriage from
San Mateo to this roads terminal point and proceeds by train to
Solitas From here they march in grand procession to Coralio where
on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound But
this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of November

Although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to
reeking June A fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon
The procession entered Coralio amid a strange silence

President Losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a
considerable ratio of Indian blood revealed in his cinnamon
complexion His carriage headed the procession surrounded and
guarded by Captain Cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light
horse _El Ciento Huilando_ Colonel Rocas followed with a regiment
of the regular army

The presidents sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected
demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of
citizens Sightseers the Anchurians are by birth and habit and they
turned out to their last ablebodied unit to witness the scene but
they maintained an accusive silence They crowded the streets to the
very wheel ruts they covered the red tile roofs to the eaves but
there was never a _viva_ from them No wreaths of palm and lemon
branches or gorgeous strings of paper roses hung from the windows and
balconies as was the custom There was an apathy a dull dissenting
disapprobation that was the more ominous because it puzzled No
one feared an outburst a revolt of the discontents for they had
no leader The president and those loyal to him had never even
heard whispered a name among them capable of crystallizing the
dissatisfaction into opposition No there could be no danger The
people always procured a new idol before they destroyed an old one

At length after a prodigious galloping and curvetting of redsashed
majors goldlaced colonels and epauletted generals the procession
formed for its annual progress down the Calle Grande to the Casa
Morena where the ceremony of welcome to the visiting president
always took place

The Swiss band led the line of march After it pranced the local
_comandante_ mounted and a detachment of his troops Next came a
carriage with four members of the cabinet conspicuous among them
the Minister of War old General Pilar with his white moustache and
his soldierly bearing Then the presidents vehicle containing also
the Ministers of Finance and State and surrounded by Captain Cruzs
light horse formed in a close double file of fours Following them
the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished
military and social ornaments of public and private life

As the band struck up and the movement began like a bird of
illomen the _Valhalla_ the swiftest steamship of the Vesuvius line
glided into the harbour in plain view of the president and his train
Of course there was nothing menacing about its arrivala business
firm does not go to war with a nationbut it reminded Senor
Espirition and others in those carriages that the Vesuvius Fruit
Company was undoubtedly carrying something up its sleeve for them

By the time the van of the procession had reached the government
building Captain Cronin of the _Valhalla_ and Mr Vincenti member
of the Vesuvius Company had landed and were pushing their way
bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow
sidewalk Clad in white linen big debonair with an air of
goodhumoured authority they made conspicuous figures among the
dark mass of unimposing Anchurians as they penetrated to within a
few yards of the steps of the Casa Morena Looking easily above the
heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the
undersized natives It was the fiery poll of Dicky Maloney against
the wall close by the lower step and his broad seductive grin
showed that he recognized their presence

Dicky had attired himself becomingly for the festive occasion in a
wellfitting black suit Pasa was close by his side her head covered
with the ubiquitous black mantilla

Mr Vincenti looked at her attentively

Botticellis Madonna he remarked gravely I wonder when she got
into the game I dont like his getting tangled with the women I
hoped he would keep away from them

Captain Cronins laugh almost drew attention from the parade

With that head of hair Keep away from the women And a Maloney
Hasnt he got a license But nonsense aside what do you think of
the prospects Its a species of filibustering out of my line

Vincenti glanced again at Dickys head and smiled

_Rouge et noir_ he said There you have it Make your play
gentlemen Our money is on the red

The lads game said Cronin with a commending look at the tall
easy figure by the steps But tis all like flybynight theatricals
to me The talks bigger than the stage theres a smell of gasoline
in the air and theyre their own audience and sceneshifters

They ceased talking for General Pilar had descended from the first
carriage and had taken his stand upon the top step of Casa Morena As
the oldest member of the cabinet custom had decreed that he should
make the address of welcome presenting the keys of the official
residence to the president at its close

General Pilar was one of the most distinguished citizens of the
republic Hero of three wars and innumerable revolutions he was an
honoured guest at European courts and camps An eloquent speaker
and a friend to the people he represented the highest type of the
Anchurians

Holding in his hand the gilt keys of Casa Morena he began his
address in a historical form touching upon each administration
and the advance of civilization and prosperity from the first dim
striving after liberty down to present times Arriving at the
regime of President Losada at which point according to precedent
he should have delivered a eulogy upon its wise conduct and the
happiness of the people General Pilar paused Then he silently held
up the bunch of keys high above his head with his eyes closely
regarding it The ribbon with which they were bound fluttered in the
breeze

It still blows cried the speaker exultantly Citizens of
Anchuria give thanks to the saints this night that our air is still
free

Thus disposing of Losadas administration he abruptly reverted
to that of Olivarra Anchurias most popular ruler Olivarra had
been assassinated nine years before while in the prime of life and
usefulness A faction of the Liberal party led by Losada himself had
been accused of the deed Whether guilty or not it was eight years
before the ambitious and scheming Losada had gained his goal

Upon this theme General Pilars eloquence was loosed He drew the
picture of the beneficent Olivarra with a loving hand He reminded
the people of the peace the security and the happiness they had
enjoyed during that period He recalled in vivid detail and with
significant contrast the last winter sojourn of President Olivarra
in Coralio when his appearance at their fiestas was the signal for
thundering _vivas_ of love and approbation

The first public expression of sentiment from the people that day
followed A low sustained murmur went among them like the surf
rolling along the shore

Ten dollars to a dinner at the Saint Charles remarked Mr
Vincenti that _rouge_ wins

I never bet against my own interests said Captain Cronin lighting
a cigar Longwinded old boy for his age Whats he talking about

My Spanish replied Vincenti runs about ten words to the minute
his is something around two hundred Whatever hes saying hes
getting them warmed up

Friends and brothers General Pilar was saying could I reach
out my hand this day across the lamentable silence of the grave to
Olivarra the Good to the ruler who was one of you whose tears
fell when you sorrowed and whose smile followed your joyI would
bring him back to you butOlivarra is deaddead at the hands of a
craven assassin

The speaker turned and gazed boldly into the carriage of the
president His arm remained extended aloft as if to sustain his
peroration The president was listening aghast at this remarkable
address of welcome He was sunk back upon his seat trembling with
rage and dumb surprise his dark hands tightly gripping the carriage
cushions

Half rising he extended one arm toward the speaker and shouted a
harsh command at Captain Cruz The leader of the Flying Hundred
sat his horse immovable with folded arms giving no sign of having
heard Losada sank back again his dark features distinctly paling

Who says that Olivarra is dead suddenly cried the speaker his
voice old as he was sounding like a battle trumpet His body
lies in the grave but to the people he loved he has bequeathed his
spirityes morehis learning his courage his kindnessyes
morehis youth his imagepeople of Anchuria have you forgotten
Ramon the son of Olivarra

Cronin and Vincenti watching closely saw Dicky Maloney suddenly
raise his hat tear off his shock of red hair leap up the steps and
stand at the side of General Pilar The Minister of War laid his
arm across the young mans shoulders All who had known President
Olivarra saw again his same lionlike pose the same frank undaunted
expression the same high forehead with the peculiar line of the
clustering crisp black hair

General Pilar was an experienced orator He seized the moment of
breathless silence that preceded the storm

Citizens of Anchuria he trumpeted holding aloft the keys to Casa
Morena I am here to deliver these keysthe keys to your homes and
libertyto your chosen president Shall I deliver them to Enrico
Olivarras assassin or to his son

Olivarra Olivarra the crowd shrieked and howled All vociferated
the magic namemen women children and the parrots

And the enthusiasm was not confined to the blood of the plebs
Colonel Rocas ascended the steps and laid his sword theatrically at
young Ramon Olivarras feet Four members of the cabinet embraced
him Captain Cruz gave a command and twenty of _El Ciento Huilando_
dismounted and arranged themselves in a cordon about the steps of
Casa Morena

But Ramon Olivarra seized that moment to prove himself a born genius
and politician He waved those soldiers aside and descended the
steps to the street There without losing his dignity or the
distinguished elegance that the loss of his red hair brought him
he took the proletariat to his bosomthe barefooted the dirty
Indians Caribs babies beggars old young saints soldiers and
sinnershe missed none of them

While this act of the drama was being presented the scene shifters
had been busy at the duties that had been assigned to them Two
of Cruzs dragoons had seized the bridle reins of Losadas horses
others formed a close guard around the carriage and they galloped
off with the tyrant and his two unpopular Ministers No doubt a place
had been prepared for them There are a number of wellbarred stone
apartments in Coralio

_Rouge_ wins said Mr Vincenti calmly lighting another cigar

Captain Cronin had been intently watching the vicinity of the stone
steps for some time

Good boy he exclaimed suddenly as if relieved I wondered if he
was going to forget his Kathleen Mavourneen

Young Olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to
General Pilar Then that distinguished veteran descended to the
ground and approached Pasa who still stood wondereyed where Dicky
had left her With his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and
decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave
her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the Casa Morena
together And then Ramon Olivarra stepped forward and took both her
hands before all the people

And while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere Captain
Cronin and Mr Vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where
the gig was waiting for them

Therell be another _presidente proclamada_ in the morning
said Mr Vincenti musingly As a rule they are not as reliable as
the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff
in him He planned and manoeuvred the entire campaign Olivarras
widow you know was wealthy After her husband was assassinated
she went to the States and educated her son at Yale The Vesuvius
Company hunted him up and backed him in the little game

Its a glorious thing said Cronin half jestingly to be able to
discharge a government and insert one of your own choosing in these
days

Oh it is only a matter of business said Vincenti stopping and
offering the stump of his cigar to a monkey that swung down from a
lime tree and that is what moves the world of today That extra
_real_ on the price of bananas had to go We took the shortest way of
removing it




XVII

TWO RECALLS


There remains three duties to be performed before the curtain falls
upon the patched comedy Two have been promised the third is no less
obligatory

It was set forth in the programme of this tropic vaudeville that
it would be made known why Shorty ODay of the Columbia Detective
Agency lost his position Also that Smith should come again to tell
us what mystery he followed that night on the shores of Anchuria when
he strewed so many cigar stumps around the cocoanut palm during his
lonely night vigil on the beach These things were promised but a
bigger thing yet remains to be accomplishedthe clearing up of a
seeming wrong that has been done according to the array of chronicled
facts truthfully set forth that have been presented And one voice
speaking shall do these three things

Two men sat on a stringer of a North River pier in the City of New
York A steamer from the tropics had begun to unload bananas and
oranges on the pier Now and then a banana or two would fall from an
overripe bunch and one of the two men would shamble forward seize
the fruit and return to share it with his companion

One of the men was in the ultimate stage of deterioration As far as
rain and wind and sun could wreck the garments he wore it had been
done In his person the ravages of drink were as plainly visible And
yet upon his highbridged rubicund nose was jauntily perched a pair
of shining and flawless goldrimmed glasses

The other man was not so far gone upon the descending Highway of the
Incompetents Truly the flower of his manhood had gone to seedseed
that perhaps no soil might sprout But there were still crosscuts
along where he travelled through which he might yet regain the
pathway of usefulness without disturbing the slumbering Miracles
This man was short and compactly built He had an oblique dead eye
like that of a stingray and the moustache of a cocktail mixer We
know the eye and the moustache we know that Smith of the luxurious
yacht the gorgeous raiment the mysterious mission the magic
disappearance has come again though shorn of the accessories of his
former state

At his third banana the man with the nose glasses spat it from him
with a shudder

Deuce take all fruit he remarked in a patrician tone of disgust
I lived for two years where these things grow The memory of their
taste lingers with you The oranges are not so bad Just see if you
can gather a couple of them ODay when the next broken crate comes
up

Did you live down with the monkeys asked the other made tepidly
garrulous by the sunshine and the alleviating meal of juicy fruit I
was down there once myself But only for a few hours That was when
I was with the Columbia Detective Agency The monkey people did me
up Id have my job yet if it hadnt been for them Ill tell you
about it

One day the chief sent a note around to the office that read Send
ODay here at once for a big piece of business I was the crack
detective of the agency at that time They always handed me the big
jobs The address the chief wrote from was down in the Wall Street
district

When I got there I found him in a private office with a lot of
directors who were looking pretty fuzzy They stated the case The
president of the Republic Insurance Company had skipped with about
a tenth of a million dollars in cash The directors wanted him back
pretty bad but they wanted the money worse They said they needed
it They had traced the old gents movements to where he boarded a
tramp fruit steamer bound for South America that same morning with
his daughter and a big gripsackall the family he had

One of the directors had his steam yacht coaled and with steam up
ready for the trip and he turned her over to me cart blongsh In
four hours I was on board of her and hot on the trail of the fruit
tub I had a pretty good idea where old Wahrfieldthat was his name
J Churchill Wahrfieldwould head for At that time we had a treaty
with about every foreign country except Belgium and that banana
republic Anchuria There wasnt a photo of old Wahrfield to be
had in New Yorkhe had been foxy therebut I had his description
And besides the lady with him would be a deadgiveaway anywhere
She was one of the highflyers in Societynot the kind that have
their pictures in the Sunday papersbut the real sort that open
chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships

Well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road The
ocean is a pretty big place and I guess we took different paths
across it But we kept going toward this Anchuria where the fruiter
was bound for

We struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four There was a
rattylooking steamer off shore taking on bananas The monkeys were
loading her up with big barges It might be the one the old man had
taken and it might not I went ashore to look around The scenery
was pretty good I never saw any finer on the New York stage I
struck an American on shore a big cool chap standing around with
the monkeys He showed me the consuls office The consul was a
nice young fellow He said the fruiter was the _Karlsefin_ running
generally to New Orleans but took her last cargo to New York Then
I was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that
no passengers had landed I didnt think they would land until after
dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that
yacht of mine hanging around So all I had to do was to wait and nab
em when they came ashore I couldnt arrest old Wahrfield without
extradition papers but my play was to get the cash They generally
give up if you strike em when theyre tired and rattled and short on
nerve

After dark I sat under a cocoanut tree on the beach for a while
and then I walked around and investigated that town some and it was
enough to give you the lions If a man could stay in New York and
be honest hed better do it than to hit that monkey town with a
million

Dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets
ladies in lowneckandshortsleeves walking around smoking cigars
tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big
mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the
paint off in frontno sira man had better be in Gods country
living on free lunch than there

The main street ran along the beach and I walked down it and
then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles
and straw I wanted to see what the monkeys did when they werent
climbing cocoanut trees The very first shack I looked in I saw
my people They must have come ashore while I was promenading A
man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black
broadcloth looking like he was just about to say Can any little
boy in the Sunday school answer that He was freezing on to a grip
that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girla regular
peach with a Fifth Avenue cutwas sitting on a wooden chair An old
black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table The light
they had come from a lantern hung on a nail I went and stood in the
door and they looked at me and I said

Mr Wahrfield you are my prisoner I hope for the ladys sake
you will take the matter sensibly You know why I want you

Who are you says the old gent

ODay says I of the Columbia Detective Agency And now sir
let me give you a piece of good advice You go back and take your
medicine like a man Hand em back the boodle and maybe theyll let
you off light Go back easy and Ill put in a word for you Ill
give you five minutes to decide I pulled out my watch and waited

Then the young lady chipped in She was one of the genuine
highsteppers You could tell by the way her clothes fit and the
style she had that Fifth Avenue was made for her

Come inside she says Dont stand in the door and disturb the
whole street with that suit of clothes Now what is it you want

Three minutes gone I said Ill tell you again while the other
two tick off

Youll admit being the president of the Republic wont you

I am says he

Well then says I it ought to be plain to you Wanted in New
York J Churchill Wahrfield president of the Republic Insurance
Company

Also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the
unlawful possession of said J Churchill Wahrfield

Ohhhh says the young lady as if she was thinking you want
to take us back to New York

To take Mr Wahrfield Theres no charge against you miss
Therell be no objection of course to your returning with your
father

Of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy
around the neck Oh father father she says kind of contralto
can this be true Have you taken money that is not yours Speak
father It made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her
voice

The old boy looked pretty bughouse when she first grappled him but
she went on whispering in his ear and patting his off shoulder till
he stood still but sweating a little

She got him to one side and they talked together a minute and then
he put on some gold eyeglasses and walked up and handed me the grip

Mr Detective he says talking a little broken I conclude
to return with you I have finished to discover that life on this
desolate and displeased coast would be worse than to die itself I
will go back and hurl myself upon the mercy of the Republic Company
Have you brought a sheep

Sheep says I I havent a single

Ship cut in the young lady Dont get funny Father is of German
birth and doesnt speak perfect English How did you come

The girl was all broke up She had a handkerchief to her face and
kept saying every little bit Oh father father She walked up to
me and laid her lilywhite hand on the clothes that had pained her at
first I smelt a million violets She was a lulu I told her I came
in a private yacht

Mr ODay she says Oh take us away from this horrid country at
once Can you Will you Say you will

Ill try I said concealing the fact that I was dying to get them
on salt water before they could change their mind

One thing they both kicked against was going through the town to the
boat landing Said they dreaded publicity and now that they were
going to return they had a hope that the thing might yet be kept out
of the papers They swore they wouldnt go unless I got them out to
the yacht without any one knowing it so I agreed to humour them

The sailors who rowed me ashore were playing billiards in a barroom
near the water waiting for orders and I proposed to have them take
the boat down the beach half a mile or so and take us up there How
to get them word was the question for I couldnt leave the grip with
the prisoner and I couldnt take it with me not knowing but what
the monkeys might stick me up

The young lady says the old coloured woman would take them a note I
sat down and wrote it and gave it to the dame with plain directions
what to do and she grins like a baboon and shakes her head

Then Mr Wahrfield handed her a string of foreign dialect and she
nods her head and says See senor maybe fifty times and lights
out with the note

Old Augusta only understands German said Miss Wahrfield smiling
at me We stopped in her house to ask where we could find lodging
and she insisted upon our having coffee She tells us she was raised
in a German family in San Domingo

Very likely I said But you can search me for German words
except _nix verstay_ and _noch einst_ I would have called that See
senor French though on a gamble

Well we three made a sneak around the edge of town so as not to
be seen We got tangled in vines and ferns and the banana bushes
and tropical scenery a good deal The monkey suburbs was as wild as
places in Central Park We came out on the beach a good half mile
below A brown chap was lying asleep under a cocoanut tree with
a tenfoot musket beside him Mr Wahrfield takes up the gun and
pitches it into the sea The coast is guarded he says Rebellion
and plots ripen like fruit He pointed to the sleeping man who
never stirred Thus he says they perform trusts Children

I saw our boat coming and I struck a match and lit a piece of
newspaper to show them where we were In thirty minutes we were on
board the yacht

The first thing Mr Wahrfield and his daughter and I took the grip
into the owners cabin opened it up and took an inventory There
was one hundred and five thousand dollars United States treasury
notes in it besides a lot of diamond jewelry and a couple of
hundred Havana cigars I gave the old man the cigars and a receipt
for the rest of the lot as agent for the company and locked the
stuff up in my private quarters

I never had a pleasanter trip than that one After we got to
sea the young lady turned out to be the jolliest ever The very
first time we sat down to dinner and the steward filled her glass
with champagnethat directors yacht was a regular floating
WaldorfAstoriashe winks at me and says Whats the use to borrow
trouble Mr Fly Cop Heres hoping you may live to eat the hen that
scratches on your grave There was a piano on board and she sat
down to it and sung better than you give up two cases to hear plenty
times She knew about nine operas clear through She was sure enough
_bon ton_ and swell She wasnt one of the among others present
kind she belonged on the special mention list

The old man too perked up amazingly on the way He passed the
cigars and says to me once quite chipper out of a cloud of smoke
Mr ODay somehow I think the Republic Company will not give me the
much trouble Guard well the gripvalise of the money Mr ODay for
that it must be returned to them that it belongs when we finish to
arrive

When we landed in New York I phoned to the chief to meet us in that
directors office We got in a cab and went there I carried the
grip and we walked in and I was pleased to see that the chief had
got together that same old crowd of moneybugs with pink faces and
white vests to see us march in I set the grip on the table Theres
the money I said

And your prisoner said the chief

I pointed to Mr Wahrfield and he stepped forward and says

The honour of a word with you sir to explain

He and the chief went into another room and stayed ten minutes When
they came back the chief looked as black as a ton of coal

Did this gentleman he says to me have this valise in his
possession when you first saw him

He did said I

The chief took up the grip and handed it to the prisoner with a
bow and says to the director crowd Do any of you recognize this
gentleman

They all shook their pink faces

Allow me to present he goes on Senor Miraflores president of
the republic of Anchuria The senor has generously consented to
overlook this outrageous blunder on condition that we undertake
to secure him against the annoyance of public comment It is a
concession on his part to overlook an insult for which he might claim
international redress I think we can gratefully promise him secrecy
in the matter

They gave him a pink nod all round

ODay he says to me As a private detective youre wasted
In a war where kidnapping governments is in the rules youd be
invaluable Come down to the office at eleven

I knew what that meant

So thats the president of the monkeys says I Well why
couldnt he have said so

Wouldnt it jar you

THE VITAGRAPHOSCOPE


Vaudeville is intrinsically episodic and discontinuous Its audiences
do not demand denouements Sufficient unto each turn is the evil
thereof No one cares how many romances the singing comedienne may
have had if she can capably sustain the limelight and a high note or
two The audiences reck not if the performing dogs get to the pound
the moment they have jumped through their last hoop They do not
desire bulletins about the possible injuries received by the comic
bicyclist who retires headfirst from the stage in a crash of
property chinaware Neither do they consider that their seat
coupons entitle them to be instructed whether or no there is a
sentiment between the lady solo banjoist and the Irish monologist

Therefore let us have no lifting of the curtain upon a tableau of the
united lovers backgrounded by defeated villainy and derogated by the
comic osculating maid and butler thrown in as a sop to the Cerberi
of the fiftycent seats

But our programme ends with a brief turn or two and then to the
exits Whoever sits the show out may find if he will the slender
thread that binds together though ever so slightly the story that
perhaps only the Walrus will understand

The Last Sausage

SCENE_An Artists Studio_ The artist a young man of prepossessing
appearance sits in a dejected attitude amid a litter of sketches
with his head resting upon his hand An oil stove stands on a pine
box in the centre of the studio The artist rises tightens his waist
belt to another hole and lights the stove He goes to a tin bread
box halfhidden by a screen takes out a solitary link of sausage
turns the box upsidedown to show that there is no more and chucks
the sausage into a fryingpan which he sets upon the stove The
flame of the stove goes out showing that there is no more oil The
artist in evident despair seizes the sausage in a sudden access of
rage and hurls it violently from him At the same time a door opens
and a man who enters receives the sausage forcibly against his nose
He seems to cry out and is observed to make a dance step or two
vigorously The newcomer is a ruddyfaced active keenlooking
man apparently of Irish ancestry Next he is observed to laugh
immoderately he kicks over the stove he claps the artist who is
vainly striving to grasp his hand vehemently upon the back Then
he goes through a pantomime which to the sufficiently intelligent
spectator reveals that he has acquired large sums of money by trading
potmetal hatchets and razors to the Indians of the Cordillera
Mountains for gold dust He draws a roll of money as large as a small
loaf of bread from his pocket and waves it above his head while at
the same time he makes pantomime of drinking from a glass The artist
hurriedly secures his hat and the two leave the studio together


The Writing on the Sands

SCENE_The Beach at Nice_ A woman beautiful still young
exquisitely clothed complacent poised reclines near the water
idly scrawling letters in the sand with the staff of her silken
parasol The beauty of her face is audacious her languid pose is one
that you feel to be impermanentyou wait expectant for her to
spring or glide or crawl like a panther that has unaccountably
become stockstill She idly scrawls in the sand and the word that
she always writes is Isabel A man sits a few yards away You can
see that they are companions even if no longer comrades His face is
dark and smooth and almost inscrutablebut not quite The two speak
little together The man also scratches on the sand with his cane
And the word that he writes is Anchuria And then he looks out
where the Mediterranean and the sky intermingle with death in his
gaze


The Wilderness and Thou

SCENE_The Borders of a Gentlemans Estate in a Tropical Land_ An
old Indian with a mahoganycoloured face is trimming the grass on a
grave by a mangrove swamp Presently he rises to his feet and walks
slowly toward a grove that is shaded by the gathering brief
twilight In the edge of the grove stand a man who is stalwart with
a kind and courteous air and a woman of a serene and clearcut
loveliness When the old Indian comes up to them the man drops money
in his hand The gravetender with the stolid pride of his race
takes it as his due and goes his way The two in the edge of the
grove turn back along the dim pathway and walk close closefor
after all what is the world at its best but a little round field of
the moving pictures with two walking together in it

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
