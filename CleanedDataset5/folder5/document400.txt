Helen of Troy and Other Poems




Helen of Troy


Wild flight on flight against the fading dawn
The flames red wings soar upward duskily
This is the funeral pyre and Troy is dead
That sparkled so the day I saw it first
And darkened slowly after I am she
Who loves all beautyyet I wither it
Why have the high gods made me wreak their wrath
Forever since my maidenhood to sow
Sorrow and blood about me Lo they keep
Their bitter care above me even now
It was the gods who led me to this lair
That tho the burning winds should make me weak
They should not snatch the life from out my lips
Olympus let the other women die
They shall be quiet when the day is done
And have no care tomorrow Yet for me
There is no rest The gods are not so kind
To her made half immortal like themselves
It is to you I owe the cruel gift
Leda my mother and the Swan my sire
To you the beauty and to you the bale
For never woman born of man and maid
Had wrought such havoc on the earth as I
Or troubled heaven with a sea of flame
That climbed to touch the silent whirling stars
And blotted out their brightness ere the dawn
Have I not made the world to weep enough
Give death to me Yet life is more than death
How could I leave the sound of singing winds
The strong sweet scent that breathes from off the sea
Or shut my eyes forever to the spring
I will not give the grave my hands to hold
My shining hair to light oblivion
Have those who wander through the ways of death
The still wan fields Elysian any love
To lift their breasts with longing any lips
To thirst against the quiver of a kiss
Lo I shall live to conquer Greece again
To make the people love who hate me now
My dreams are over I have ceased to cry
Against the fate that made men love my mouth
And left their spirits all too deaf to hear
The little songs that echoed through my soul
I have no anger now The dreams are done
Yet since the Greeks and Trojans would not see
Aught but my bodys fairness till the end
In all the islands set in all the seas
And all the lands that lie beneath the sun
Till light turn darkness and till time shall sleep
Mens lives shall waste with longing after me
For I shall be the sum of their desire
The whole of beauty never seen again
And they shall stretch their arms and starting wake
With Helen on their lips and in their eyes
The vision of me Always I shall be
Limned on the darkness like a shaft of light
That glimmers and is gone They shall behold
Each one his dream that fashions me anew
With hair like lakes that glint beneath the stars
Dark as sweet midnight or with hair aglow
Like burnished gold that still retains the fire
Yea I shall haunt until the dusk of time
The heavy eyelids filled with fleeting dreams

I wait for one who comes with sword to slay
The king I wronged who searches for me now
And yet he shall not slay me I shall stand
With lifted head and look within his eyes
Baring my breast to him and to the sun
He shall not have the power to stain with blood
That whitenessfor the thirsty sword shall fall
And he shall cry and catch me in his arms
Bearing me back to Sparta on his breast
Lo I shall live to conquer Greece again




Beatrice


Send out the singerslet the room be still
They have not eased my pain nor brought me sleep
Close out the sun for I would have it dark
That I may feel how black the grave will be
The sun is setting for the light is red
And you are outlined in a golden fire
Like Ursula upon an altarscreen
Come leave the light and sit beside my bed
For I have had enough of saints and prayers
Strange broken thoughts are beating in my brain
They come and vanish and again they come
It is the fever driving out my soul
And Death stands waiting by the arras there

Ornella I will speak for soon my lips
Shall keep a silence till the end of time
You have a mouth for lovinglisten then
Keep tryst with Love before Death comes to tryst
For I who die could wish that I had lived
A little closer to the world of men
Not watching always thro the blazoned panes
That show the world in chilly greens and blues
And grudge the sunshine that would enter in
I was no part of all the troubled crowd
That moved beneath the palace windows here
And yet sometimes a knight in shining steel
Would pass and catch the gleaming of my hair
And wave a mailed hand and smile at me
Whereat I made no sign and turned away
Affrighted and yet glad and full of dreams
Ah dreams and dreams that asked no answering
I should have wrought to make my dreams come true
But all my life was like an autumn day
Full of gray quiet and a hazy peace

What was I saying All is gone again
It seemed but now I was the little child
Who played within a garden long ago
Beyond the walls the festal trumpets blared
Perhaps they carried some Madonna by
With tossing ensigns in a sea of flowers
A painted Virgin with a painted Child
Who saw for once the sweetness of the sun
Before they shut her in an altarniche
Where tapers smoke against the windy gloom
I gathered roses redder than my gown
And played that I was Saint Elizabeth
Whose wine had turned to roses in her hands
And as I played a child came thro the gate
A boy who looked at me without a word
As tho he saw stretch far behind my head
Long lines of radiant angels row on row
That day we spoke a little timidly
And after that I never heard the voice
That sang so many songs for love of me
He was content to stand and watch me pass
To seek for me at matins every day
Where I could feel his eyes the while I prayed
I think if he had stretched his hands to me
Or moved his lips to say a single word
I might have loved himhe had wondrous eyes

Ornella are you there I cannot see
Is every one so lonely when he dies

The room is filled with lightswith waving lights
Who are the men and women round the bed
What have I said Ornella Have they heard
There was no evil hidden in my life
And yet and yet I would not have them know

Am I not floating in a mist of light
O lift me up and I shall reach the sun




Sappho


The twilights inner flame grows blue and deep
And in my Lesbos over leagues of sea
The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees
Twilight has veiled the little flower face
Here on my heart but still the night is kind
And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast
Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk
Along the surges creeping up the shore
When tides came in to ease the hungry beach
And running running till the night was black
Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand
And quiver with the winds from off the sea
Ah quietly the shingle waits the tides
Whose waves are stinging kisses but to me
Love brought no peace nor darkness any rest
I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands
And cried to Love from whom the sea is sweet
From whom the sea is bitterer than death
Ah Aphrodite if I sing no more
To thee Gods daughter powerful as God
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
To hold the added sweetness of a song
There is a quiet at the heart of love
And I have pierced the pain and come to peace
I hold my peace my Cleis on my heart
And softer than a little wild birds wing
Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth
Ah never any more when spring like fire
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves
Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude
Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus lyre
Beyond the sob that stilled Erinnas voice
Ah never with a throat that aches with song
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring
Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love
The quiver and the crying of my heart
Still I remember how I strove to flee
The lovenote of the birds and bowed my head
To hurry faster but upon the ground
I saw two winged shadows side by side
And all the worlds spring passion stifled me
Ah Love there is no fleeing from thy might
No lonely place where thou hast never trod
No desert thou hast left uncarpeted
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet
In many guises didst thou come to me
I saw thee by the maidens while they danced
Phaon allured me with a look of thine
In Anactoria I knew thy grace
I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes
But never wholly soul and body mine
Didst thou bid any love me as I loved
Now I have found the peace that fled from me
Close close against my heart I hold my world
Ah Love that made my life a lyric cry
Ah Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine
I taught the world thy music now alone
I sing for one who falls asleep to hear




Marianna Alcoforando

The Portuguese Nun16401723


The sparrows wake beneath the convent eaves
I think I have not slept the whole night through
But I am old the aged scarcely know
The times they wake and sleep for life burns down
They breathe the calm of death before they die
The long night ends the day comes creeping in
Showing the sorrows that the darkness hid
The bended head of Christ the blood the thorns
The walls gray stains of damp the pallet bed
Where little Sister Marta dreams of saints
Waking with arms outstretched imploringly
That seek to stay a visions vanishing
I never had a vision yet for me
Our Lady smiled while all the convent slept
One winter midnight hushed around with snow
I thought she might be kinder than the rest
And so I came to kneel before her feet
Sick with loves sorrow and loves bitterness
But when I would have made the blessed sign
I found the water frozen in the font
And touched but ice within the carved stone
The saints had hid themselves away from me
Leaving the windows black against the night
And when I sank upon the altar steps
Before the Virgin Mother and her Child
The last pale lowburnt taper flickered out
But in the darkness smooth and fathomless
Still twinkled like a star the holy lamp
That cast a dusky glow upon her face
Then through the numbing cold peace fell on me
Submission and the gracious gift of tears
For when I looked Oh blessed miracle
Her lips had parted and Our Lady smiled
And then I knew that Love is worth its pain
And that my heart was richer for his sake
Since lack of love is bitterest of all

The day is broad awakethe first long beam
Of level sun finds Sister Martas face
And trembling there it lights a timid smile
Upon the lips that say so many prayers
And have no words for hate and none for love
But when she passes where her prayers have gone
Will God not smile a little sadly then
And send her back with gentle words to earth
That she may hold a child against her breast
And feel its little hands upon her hair
We weep before the Blessed Mothers shrine
To think upon her sorrows but her joys
What nun could ever know a tithing of
The precious hours she watched above His sleep
Were worth the fearful anguish of the end
Yea lack of love is bitterest of all
Yet I have felt what thing it is to know
One thought forever sleeping or awake
To say one name whose sweetness grows so strange
That it might work a spell on those who weep
To feel the weight of love upon my heart
So heavy that the blood can scarcely flow
Love comes to some unlookedfor quietly
As when at twilight with a soft surprise
We see the newborn crescent in the blue
And unto others love is planetlike
A cold and placid gleam that wavers not
And there are those who wait the call of love
Expectant of his coming as we watch
To see the east grow pallid ere the moon
Lifts up her flowerlike head against the night
Love came to me as comes a cruel sun
That on some raindrenched morning when the leaves
Are bowed beneath their clinging weight of drops
Tears through the mist and burns with fervent heat
The tender grasses and the meadow flowers
Then suddenly the heavy clouds close in
And through the dark the thunders muttering
Is drowned amid the dashing of the rain

But I have seen my day grow calm again
The sun sets slowly on a peaceful world
And sheds a quiet light across the fields




Guenevere


I was a queen and I have lost my crown
A wife and I have broken all my vows
A lover and I ruined him I loved
There is no other havoc left to do
A little month ago I was a queen
And mothers held their babies up to see
When I came riding out of Camelot
The women smiled and all the world smiled too
And now what womans eyes would smile on me
I still am beautiful and yet what child
Would think of me as some high heavensent thing
An angel clad in gold and miniver
The world would run from me and yet am I
No different from the queen they used to love
If water flowing silver over stones
Is forded and beneath the horses feet
Grows turbid suddenly it clears again
And men will drink it with no thought of harm
Yet I am branded for a single fault

I was the flower amid a toiling world
Where people smiled to see one happy thing
And they were proud and glad to raise me high
They only asked that I should be right fair
A little kind and gowned wondrously
And surely it were little praise to me
If I had pleased them well throughout my life

I was a queen the daughter of a king
The crown was never heavy on my head
It was my right and was a part of me
The women thought me proud the men were kind
And bowed right gallantly to kiss my hand
And watched me as I passed them calmly by
Along the halls I shall not tread again
What if tonight I should revisit them
The warders at the gates the kitchenmaids
The very beggars would stand off from me
And I their queen would climb the stairs alone
Pass through the banquethall a loathed thing
And seek my chambers for a hidingplace
And I should find them but a sepulchre
The very rushes rotted on the floors
The fire in ashes on the freezing hearth
I was a queen and he who loved me best
Made me a woman for a night and day
And now I go unqueened forevermore
A queen should never dream on summer eves
When hovering spells are heavy in the dusk
I think no night was ever quite so still
So smoothly lit with red along the west
So deeply hushed with quiet through and through
And strangely clear and deeply dyed with light
The trees stood straight against a paling sky
With Venus burning lamplike in the west

I walked alone amid a thousand flowers
That drooped their heads and drowsed beneath the dew
And all my thoughts were quieted to sleep
Behind me on the walk I heard a step
I did not know my heart could tell his tread
I did not know I loved him till that hour
Within my breast I felt a wild sick pain
The garden reeled a little I was weak
And quick he came behind me caught my arms
That ached beneath his touch and then I swayed
My head fell backward and I saw his face

All this grows bitter that was once so sweet
And many mouths must drain the dregs of it
But none will pity me nor pity him
Whom Love so lashed and with such cruel thongs




Erinna


They sent you in to say farewell to me
No do not shake your head I see your eyes
That shine with tears Sappho you saw the sun
Just now when you came hither and again
When you have left me all the shimmering
Great meadows will laugh lightly and the sun
Put round about you warm invisible arms
As might a lover decking you with light
I go toward darkness tho I lie so still
If I could see the sun I should look up
And drink the light until my eyes were blind
I should kneel down and kiss the blades of grass
And I should call the birds with such a voice
With such a longing tremulous and keen
That they would fly to me and on the breast
Bear evermore to treetops and to fields
The kiss I gave them Sappho tell me this
Was I not sometimes fair My eyes my mouth
My hair that loved the wind were they not worth
The breath of love upon them Yet he passed
And he will pass tonight when all the air
Is blue with twilight but I shall not see
I shall have gone forever Hold my hands
Hold fast that Death may never come between
Swear by the gods you will not let me go
Make songs for Death as you would sing to Love
But you will not assuage him He alone
Of all the gods will take no gifts from men
I am afraid afraid

 Sappho lean down
Last night the fever gave a dream to me
It takes my life and gives a little dream
I thought I saw him stand the man I love
Here in my quiet chamber with his eyes
Fixed on me as I entered while he drew
Silently toward mehe who night by night
Goes by my door without a thought of me
Neared me and put his hand behind my head
And leaning toward me kissed me on the mouth
That was a little dream for Death to give
Too short to take the whole of life for yet
I woke with lips made quiet by a kiss
The dream is worth the dying Do not smile
So sadly on me with your shining eyes
You who can set your sorrow to a song
And ease your hurt by singing But to me
My songs are less than seasand that the wind
Drives stinging over me and bears away
I have no care what place the grains may fall
Nor of my songs if Time shall blow them back
As landwind breaks the lines of dying foam
Along the bright wet beaches scattering
The flakes once more against the laboring sea
Into oblivion What care have I
To please Apollo since Love hearkens not
Your words will live forever men will say
She was the perfect loverI shall die
I loved too much to live Go Sappho go
I hate your hands that beat so full of life
Go lest my hatred hurt you I shall die
But you will live to love and love again
He might have loved some other spring than this
I should have kept my lifeI let it go
He would not love me now tho Cypris bound
Her girdle round me I am Deaths not Loves
Go from me Sappho back to find the sun


I am alone alone O Cyprian   




Love Songs



 Song


You bound strong sandals on my feet
 You gave me bread and wine
And bade me out neath sun and stars
 For all the world was mine

Oh take the sandals off my feet
 You know not what you do
For all my world is in your arms
 My sun and stars are you




 The Rose and the Bee


If I were a bee and you were a rose
Would you let me in when the gray wind blows
Would you hold your petals wide apart
Would you let me in to find your heart
 If you were a rose

If I were a rose and you were a bee
You should never go when you came to me
I should hold my love on my heart at last
I should close my leaves and keep you fast
 If you were a bee




 The Song Maker


I made a hundred little songs
 That told the joy and pain of love
And sang them blithely tho I knew
 No whit thereof

I was a weaver deaf and blind
 A miracle was wrought for me
But I have lost my skill to weave
 Since I can see

For while I sangah swift and strange
 Love passed and touched me on the brow
And I who made so many songs
 Am silent now




 Wild Asters


In the spring I asked the daisies
 If his words were true
And the clever little daisies
 Always knew

Now the fields are brown and barren
 Bitter autumn blows
And of all the stupid asters
 Not one knows




 When Love Goes


 I

O mother I am sick of love
 I cannot laugh nor lift my head
My bitter dreams have broken me
 I would my love were dead

Drink of the draught I brew for thee
Thou shalt have quiet in its stead


 II

Where is the silver in the rain
 Where is the music in the sea
Where is the bird that sang all day
 To break my heart with melody

The night thou badst Love fly away
He hid them all from thee




 The Wayfarer


Love entered in my heart one day
 A sad unwelcome guest
But when he begged that he might stay
 I let him wait and rest

He broke my sleep with sorrowing
 And shook my dreams with tears
And when my heart was fain to sing
 He stilled its joy with fears

But now that he has gone his way
 I miss the old sweet pain
And sometimes in the night I pray
 That he may come again




 The Princess in the Tower


 I

The Princess sings

 I am the princess up in the tower
 And I dream the whole day thro
 Of a knight who shall come with a silver spear
 And a waving plume of blue

 I am the princess up in the tower
 And I dream my dreams by day
 But sometimes I wake and my eyes are wet
 When the dusk is deep and gray

 For the peasant lovers go by beneath
 I hear them laugh and kiss
 And I forget my daydream knight
 And long for a love like this


 II

The Minstrel sings

 I lie beside the princess tower
 So close she cannot see my face
 And watch her dreaming all day long
 And bending with a lilys grace

 Her cheeks are paler than the moon
 That sails along a sunny sky
 And yet her silent mouth is red
 Where tender words and kisses lie

 I am a minstrel with a harp
 For love of her my songs are sweet
 And yet I dare not lift the voice
 That lies so far beneath her feet


 III

The Knight sings

 O princess cease your dreams awhile
 And look adown your towers gray side
 The princess gazes far away
 Nor hears nor heeds the words I cried

 Perchance my heart was overbold
 God made her dreams too pure to break
 She sees the angels in the air
 Fly to and fro for Marys sake

 Farewell I mount and go my way
 But oh her hair the sun sifts thro
 The tilts and tourneys wait my spear
 I am the Knight of the Plume of Blue




 When Love Was Born


When Love was born I think he lay
 Right warm on Venus breast
And whiles he smiled and whiles would play
 And whiles would take his rest

But always folded out of sight
 The wings were growing strong
That were to bear him off in flight
 Erelong erelong




 The Shrine


There is no lord within my heart
 Left silent as an empty shrine
 Where rose and myrtle intertwine
Within a place apart

No god is there of carven stone
 To watch with still approving eyes
 My thoughts like steady incense rise
I dream and weep alone

But if I keep my altar fair
 Some morning I shall lift my head
 From roses deftly garlanded
To find the god is there




 The Blind


The birds are all abuilding
 They say the worlds aflower
And still I linger lonely
 Within a barren bower

I weave a web of fancies
 Of tears and darkness spun
How shall I sing of sunlight
 Who never saw the sun

I hear the pipes ablowing
 But yet I may not dance
I know that Love is passing
 I cannot catch his glance

And if his voice should call me
 And I with groping dim
Should reach his place of calling
 And stretch my arms to him

The wind would blow between my hands
 For Joy that I shall miss
The rain would fall upon my mouth
 That his will never kiss




 Love Me


Brownthrush singing all day long
 In the leaves above me
Take my love this little song
 Love me love me love me

When he harkens what you say
 Bid him lest he miss me
Leave his work or leave his play
 And kiss me kiss me kiss me




 The Song for Colin


I sang a song at dusking time
 Beneath the evening star
And Terence left his latest rhyme
 To answer from afar

Pierrot laid down his lute to weep
 And sighed She sings for me
But Colin slept a careless sleep
 Beneath an apple tree




 Four Winds


Four winds blowing thro the sky
You have seen poor maidens die
Tell me then what I shall do
That my lover may be true
Said the wind from out the south
Lay no kiss upon his mouth
And the wind from out the west
Wound the heart within his breast
And the wind from out the east
Send him empty from the feast
And the wind from out the north
In the tempest thrust him forth
When thou art more cruel than he
Then will Love be kind to thee




 Roundel


If he could know my songs are all for him
At silver dawn or in the evening glow
Would he not smile and think it but a whim
 If he could know

Or would his heart rejoice and overflow
As happy brooks that break their icy rim
When Aprils horns along the hillsides blow

I may not speak till Eros torch is dim
The god is bitter and will have it so
And yet tonight our fate would seem less grim
 If he could know




 Dew


I dream that he is mine
 I dream that he is true
And all his words I keep
 As roseleaves hold the dew

O little thirsty rose
 O little heart beware
Lest you should hope to hold
 A hundred roses share




 A Maiden


Oh if I were the velvet rose
 Upon the red rose vine
Id climb to touch his window
 And make his casement fine

And if I were the little bird
 That twitters on the tree
All day Id sing my love for him
 Till he should harken me

But since I am a maiden
 I go with downcast eyes
And he will never hear the songs
 That he has turned to sighs

And since I am a maiden
 My love will never know
That I could kiss him with a mouth
 More red than roses blow




 I Love You


When April bends above me
 And finds me fast asleep
Dust need not keep the secret
 A live heart died to keep

When April tells the thrushes
 The meadowlarks will know
And pipe the three words lightly
 To all the winds that blow

Above his roof the swallows
 In notes like farblown rain
Will tell the little sparrow
 Beside his windowpane

O sparrow little sparrow
 When I am fast asleep
Then tell my love the secret
 That I have died to keep




 But Not to Me


The April night is still and sweet
 With flowers on every tree
Peace comes to them on quiet feet
 But not to me

My peace is hidden in his breast
 Where I shall never be
Love comes tonight to all the rest
 But not to me




 Hidden Love


I hid the love within my heart
 And lit the laughter in my eyes
That when we meet he may not know
 My love that never dies

But sometimes when he dreams at night
 Of fragrant forests green and dim
It may be that my love crept out
 And brought the dream to him

And sometimes when his heart is sick
 And suddenly grows well again
It may be that my love was there
 To free his life of pain




 Snow Song


Fairy snow fairy snow
Blowing blowing everywhere
 Would that I
 Too could fly
Lightly lightly through the air

Like a wee crystal star
I should drift I should blow
 Near more near
 To my dear
Where he comes through the snow

I should fly to my love
Like a flake in the storm
 I should die
 I should die
On his lips that are warm




 Youth and the Pilgrim


Gray pilgrim you have journeyed far
 I pray you tell to me
Is there a land where Love is not
 By shore of any sea

For I am weary of the god
 And I would flee from him
Tho I must take a ship and go
 Beyond the oceans rim

I know a port where Love is not
 The ship is in your hand
Then plunge your sword within your breast
 And you will reach the land




 The Wanderer


I saw the sunsetcolored sands
 The Nile like flowing fire between
 Where Rameses stares forth serene
And Ammons heavy temple stands

I saw the rocks where long ago
 Above the sea that cries and breaks
 Bright Perseus with Medusas snakes
Set free the maiden white like snow

And many skies have covered me
 And many winds have blown me forth
 And I have loved the green bright north
And I have loved the cold sweet sea

But what to me are north and south
 And what the lure of many lands
 Since you have leaned to catch my hands
And lay a kiss upon my mouth




 I Would Live in Your Love


I would live in your love as the seagrasses live in the sea
Borne up by each wave as it passes drawn down by each wave that recedes
I would empty my soul of the dreams that have gathered in me
I would beat with your heart as it beats I would follow your soul
 as it leads




 May


The wind is tossing the lilacs
 The new leaves laugh in the sun
And the petals fall on the orchard wall
 But for me the spring is done

Beneath the apple blossoms
 I go a wintry way
For love that smiled in April
 Is false to me in May




 Rispetto


Was that his step that sounded on the stair
 Was that his knock I heard upon the door
I grow so tired I almost cease to care
 And yet I would that he might come once more

It was the wind I heard that mocks at me
The bitter wind that is more cruel than he
It was the wind that knocked upon the door
But he will never knock nor enter more




 Less than the Cloud to the Wind


Less than the cloud to the wind
 Less than the foam to the sea
Less than the rose to the storm
 Am I to thee

More than the star to the night
 More than the rain to the lea
More than heaven to earth
 Art thou to me




 Buried Love


I shall bury my weary Love
 Beneath a tree
In the forest tall and black
 Where none can see

I shall put no flowers at his head
 Nor stone at his feet
For the mouth I loved so much
 Was bittersweet

I shall go no more to his grave
 For the woods are cold
I shall gather as much of joy
 As my hands can hold

I shall stay all day in the sun
 Where the wide winds blow
But oh I shall weep at night
 When none will know




 Song


O woe is me my heart is sad
 For I should never know
If Love came by like any lad
 Without his silver bow

Or if he left his arrows sharp
 And came a minstrel weary
Id never tell him by his harp
 Nor know him for my dearie

O go your ways and have no fear
 For tho Love passes by
Hell come a hundred times my dear
 Before your turn to die




 Pierrot


Pierrot stands in the garden
 Beneath a waning moon
And on his lute he fashions
 A little silver tune

Pierrot plays in the garden
 He thinks he plays for me
But I am quite forgotten
 Under the cherry tree

Pierrot plays in the garden
 And all the roses know
That Pierrot loves his music
 But I love Pierrot




 At Night


Love said Wake still and think of me
 Sleep Close your eyes till break of day
But Dreams came by and smilingly
 Gave both to Love and Sleep their way




 Song


When Love comes singing to his heart
 That would not wake for me
I think that I shall know his joy
 By my own ecstasy

And tho the sea were all between
 The time their hands shall meet
My heart will know his happiness
 So wildly it will beat

And when he bends above her mouth
 Rejoicing for his sake
My soul will sing a little song
 But oh my heart will break




 Love in Autumn


I sought among the drifting leaves
 The golden leaves that once were green
To see if Love were hiding there
 And peeping out between

For thro the silver showers of May
 And thro the summers heavy heat
In vain I sought his golden head
 And light fastflying feet

Perhaps when all the world is bare
 And cruel winter holds the land
The Love that finds no place to hide
 Will run and catch my hand

I shall not care to have him then
 I shall be bitter and acold
It grows too late for frolicking
 When all the world is old

Then little hiding Love come forth
 Come forth before the autumn goes
And let us seek thro ruined paths
 The gardens last red rose




 The Kiss


I hoped that he would love me
 And he has kissed my mouth
But I am like a stricken bird
 That cannot reach the south

For tho I know he loves me
 Tonight my heart is sad
His kiss was not so wonderful
 As all the dreams I had




 November


The world is tired the year is old
 The little leaves are glad to die
The wind goes shivering with cold
 Among the rushes dry

Our love is dying like the grass
 And we who kissed grow coldly kind
Half glad to see our poor love pass
 Like leaves along the wind




 A Song of the Princess


The princess has her lovers
 A score of knights has she
And each can sing a madrigal
 And praise her gracefully

But Love that is so bitter
 Hath put within her heart
A longing for the scornful knight
 Who silent stands apart

And tho the others praise and plead
 She maketh no reply
Yet for a single word from him
 I ween that she would die




 The Wind


A wind is blowing over my soul
 I hear it cry the whole night thro
Is there no peace for me on earth
 Except with you

Alas the wind has made me wise
 Over my naked soul it blew
There is no peace for me on earth
 Even with you




 A Winter Night


My windowpane is starred with frost
 The world is bitter cold tonight
The moon is cruel and the wind
 Is like a twoedged sword to smite

God pity all the homeless ones
 The beggars pacing to and fro
God pity all the poor tonight
 Who walk the lamplit streets of snow

My room is like a bit of June
 Warm and closecurtained fold on fold
But somewhere like a homeless child
 My heart is crying in the cold




 The Metropolitan Tower


We walked together in the dusk
 To watch the tower grow dimly white
And saw it lift against the sky
 Its flower of amber light

You talked of half a hundred things
 I kept each little word you said
And when at last the hour was full
 I saw the light turn red

You did not know the time had come
 You did not see the sudden flower
Nor know that in my heart Loves birth
 Was reckoned from that hour




 Gramercy Park

 For W P


The little park was filled with peace
 The walks were carpeted with snow
But every iron gate was locked
 Lest if we entered peace would go

We circled it a dozen times
 The wind was blowing from the sea
I only felt your restless eyes
 Whose love was like a cloak for me

Oh heavy gates that fate has locked
 To bar the joy we may not win
Peace would go out forevermore
 If we should dare to enter in




 In the Metropolitan Museum


Within the tiny Pantheon
 We stood together silently
Leaving the restless crowd awhile
 As ships find shelter from the sea

The ancient centuries came back
 To cover us a moments space
And thro the dome the light was glad
 Because it shone upon your face

Ah not from Rome but farther still
 Beyond sunsmitten Salamis
The moment took us till you stooped
 To find the present with a kiss




 Coney Island


Why did you bring me here
The sand is white with snow
Over the wooden domes
The winter seawinds blow
There is no shelter near
 Come let us go

With foam of icy lace
The sea creeps up the sand
The wind is like a hand
That strikes us in the face
Doors that June set aswing
Are bolted long ago
We try them uselessly
Alas there cannot be
For us a second spring
 Come let us go




 Union Square


With the man I love who loves me not
 I walked in the streetlamps flare
We watched the world go home that night
 In a flood through Union Square

I leaned to catch the words he said
 That were light as a snowflake falling
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
 The words my heart was calling

And on we walked and on we walked
 Past the fiery lights of the picture shows
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
 On the errand each man knows

And on we walked and on we walked
 At the door at last we said goodbye
I knew by his smile he had not heard
 My hearts unuttered cry

With the man I love who loves me not
 I walked in the streetlamps flare
But oh the girls who can ask for love
 In the lights of Union Square




 Central Park at Dusk


Buildings above the leafless trees
 Loom high as castles in a dream
While one by one the lamps come out
 To thread the twilight with a gleam

There is no sign of leaf or bud
 A hush is over everything
Silent as women wait for love
 The world is waiting for the spring




 Young Love


 I

I cannot heed the words they say
 The lights grow far away and dim
Amid the laughing men and maids
 My eyes unbidden seek for him

I hope that when he smiles at me
 He does not guess my joy and pain
For if he did he is too kind
 To ever look my way again


 II

I have a secret in my heart
 No ears have ever heard
And still it sings there day by day
 Most like a caged bird

And when it beats against the bars
 I do not set it free
For I am happier to know
 It only sings for me


 III

I wrote his name along the beach
 I love the letters so
Far up it seemed and out of reach
 For still the tide was low

But oh the sea came creeping up
 And washed the name away
And on the sand where it had been
 A bit of seagrass lay

A bit of seagrass on the sand
 Dropped from a mermaids hair
Ah had she come to kiss his name
 And leave a token there


 IV

What am I that he should love me
He who stands so far above me
 What am I
I am like a cowslip turning
 Toward the sky
Where a planets golden burning
Breaks the cowslips heart with yearning
What am I that he should love me
 What am I


 V

O dreams that flock about my sleep
 I pray you bring my love to me
And let me think I hear his voice
 Again ring free

And if you care to please me well
 And live tomorrow in my mind
Let him who was so cold before
 Tonight seem kind


 VI

I plucked a daisy in the fields
 And there beneath the sun
I let its silver petals fall
 One after one

I said He loves me loves me not
 And oh my heart beat fast
The flower was kind it let me say
 He loves me last

I kissed the little leafless stem
 But oh my poor heart knew
The words the flower had said to me
 They were not true


 VII

I sent my love a letter
 And if he loves me not
He shall not find my love for him
 In any line or dot

But if he loves me truly
 Hell find it hidden deep
As dawn gleams red thro chilly clouds
 To eyes awaked from sleep


 VIII

The world is cold and gray and wet
And I am heavyhearted yet
When I am home and look to see
The place my letters wait for me
If I should find ONE letter there
I think I should not greatly care
If it were rainy or were fair
For all the world would suddenly
Seem like a festival to me


 IX

I hid three words within my heart
 That longed to fly to him
At dawn they woke me with a start
 They sang till day was dim

And now at last I let them fly
 As little birds should do
And he will know the first is I
 The others Love and You


 X

Across the twilights violet
 His curtained window glimmers gold
Oh happy light that round my love
 Can fold

Oh happy book within his hand
 Oh happy page he glorifies
Oh happy little word beneath
 His eyes

But oh thrice happy happy I
 Who love him more than songs can tell
For in the heaven of his heart
 I dwell




Sonnets and Lyrics




 Primavera Mia


As kings who see their little lifeday pass
Take off the heavy ermine and the crown
So had the trees that autumntime laid down
Their golden garments on the faded grass
When I who watched the seasons in the glass
Of mine own thoughts saw all the autumns brown
Leap into life and don a sunny gown
Of leafage such as happy April has
Great spring came singing upward from the south
For in my heart far carried on the wind
Your words like winged seeds took root and grew
And all the world caught music from your mouth
I saw the light as one who had been blind
And knew my sun and song and spring were you




 Souls Birth


When you were born beloved was your soul
New made by God to match your bodys flower
And were they both at one same precious hour
Sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole
Or had your soul since dim creation burned
A star in some still region of the sky
That leaping earthward left its place on high
And to your little newborn body yearned
No words can tell in what celestial hour
God made your soul and gave it mortal birth
Nor in the disarray of all the stars
Is any place so sweet that such a flower
Might linger there until thro heavens bars
It heard Gods voice that bade it down to earth




 Love and Death


Shall we too rise forgetful from our sleep
And shall my soul that lies within your hand
Remember nothing as the blowing sand
Forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep
When winds along the darkened desert sweep
Or would it still remember tho it spanned
A thousand heavens while the planets fanned
The vacant ether with their voices deep
Soul of my soul no word shall be forgot
Nor yet alone beloved shall we see
The desolation of extinguished suns
Nor fear the void wherethro our planet runs
For still together shall we go and not
Fare forth alone to front eternity




 For the Anniversary of John Keats Death

 February 23 1821


At midnight when the moonlit cypress trees
Have woven round his grave a magic shade
Still weeping the unfinished hymn he made
There moves fresh Maia like a morning breeze
Blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease
And stooping where her poets head is laid
Selene weeps while all the tides are stayed
And swaying seas are darkened into peace
But they who wake the meadows and the tides
Have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep
Who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep
Startling the Quiet Land where he abides
And charming still sadeyed Persephone
With visions of the sunny earth and sea




 Silence

 To Eleonora Duse


We are anhungered after solitude
Deep stillness pure of any speech or sound
Soft quiet hovering over pools profound
The silences that on the desert brood
Above a windless hush of empty seas
The broad unfurling banners of the dawn
A faery forest where there sleeps a Faun
Our souls are fain of solitudes like these
O woman who divined our weariness
And set the crown of silence on your art
From what undreamedof depth within your heart
Have you sent forth the hush that makes us free
To hear an instant high above earths stress
The silent music of infinity




 The Return


I turned the key and opened wide the door
To enter my deserted room again
Where thro the long hot months the dust had lain
Was it not lonely when across the floor
No step was heard no sudden song that bore
My whole heart upward with a joyous pain
Were not the pictures and the volumes fain
To have me with them always as before
But Giorgiones Venus did not deign
To lift her lids nor did the subtle smile
Of Mona Lisa deepen Madeleine
Still wept against the glory of her hair
Nor did the lovers part their lips the while
But kissed unheeding that I watched them there




 Fear


I am afraid oh I am so afraid
The cold black fear is clutching me tonight
As long ago when they would take the light
And leave the little child who would have prayed
Frozen and sleepless at the thought of death
My heart that beats too fast will rest too soon
I shall not know if it be night or noon
Yet shall I struggle in the dark for breath
Will no one fight the Terror for my sake
The heavy darkness that no dawn will break
How can they leave me in that dark alone
Who loved the joy of light and warmth so much
And thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch
How can they shut me underneath a stone




 Anadyomene


The wide bright temple of the world I found
And entered from the dizzy infinite
That I might kneel and worship thee in it
Leaving the singing stars their ceaseless round
Of silver music sound on orbed sound
For measured spaces where the shrines are lit
And men with wisdom or with little wit
Implore the gods that mercy may abound
Ah Aphrodite was it not from thee
My summons came across the endless spaces
Mother of Love turn not thy face from me
Now that I seek for thee in human faces
Answer my prayer or set my spirit free
Again to drift along the starry places




 Galahad in the Castle of the Maidens

 To the maiden with the hidden face in Abbeys painting


The other maidens raised their eyes to him
Who stumbled in before them when the fight
Had left him victor with a victors right
I think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim
He scarcely saw her swaying white and slim
And trembling slightly dreaming of his might
Nor knew he touched her hand as strangely light
As a wan wraiths beside a rivers rim
The other maidens raised their eyes to see
And only she has hid her face away
And yet I ween she loved him more than they
And very fairly fashioned was her face
Yet for Loves shame and sweet humility
She dared not meet him with their queenlike grace




 To an Aeolian Harp


The winds have grown articulate in thee
And voiced again the wail of ancient woe
That smote upon the winds of long ago
The cries of Trojan women as they flee
The quivering moan of pale Andromache
Now lifted loud with pain and now brought low
It is the soul of sorrow that we know
As in a shell the soul of all the sea
So sometimes in the compass of a song
Unknown to him who sings thro lips that live
The voiceless dead of longforgotten lands
Proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong
In sweeping sadness of the winds that give
Thy strings no rest from weariless wild hands




 To Erinna


Was Time not harsh to you or was he kind
O pale Erinna of the perfect lyre
That he has left no word of singing fire
Whereby you waked the dreaming Lesbian wind
And kindled night along the lyric shore
O girl whose lips Erato stooped to kiss
Do you go sorrowing because of this
In fields where poets sing forevermore
Or are you glad and is it best to be
A silent music men have never heard
A dream in all our souls that we may say
Her voice had all the rapture of the sea
And all the clear cool quiver of a bird
Deep in a forest at the break of day




 To Cleis

 I have a fair daughter with a form like a golden flower
 Cleis the beloved
 Sapphic fragment


When the dusk was wet with dew
 Cleis did the muses nine
 Listen in a silent line
While your mother sang to you

Did they weep or did they smile
 When she crooned to still your cries
 She a muse in human guise
Who forsook her lyre awhile

Did you feel her wild heart beat
 Did the warmth of all the sun
 Thro your little body run
When she kissed your hands and feet

Did your fingers babywise
 Touch her face and touch her hair
 Did you think your mother fair
Could you bear her burning eyes

Are the songs that soothed your fears
 Vanished like a vanished flame
 Save the line where shines your name
Starlike down the graying years

Cleis speaks no word to me
 For the land where she has gone
 Lieth mute at dusk and dawn
Like a windless tideless sea




 Paris in Spring


The citys all ashining
 Beneath a fickle sun
A gay young winds ablowing
 The little shower is done
But the raindrops still are clinging
 And falling one by one
Oh its Paris its Paris
 And springtime has begun

I know the Bois is twinkling
 In a sort of hazy sheen
And down the Champs the gray old arch
 Stands cold and still between
But the walk is flecked with sunlight
 Where the great acacias lean
Oh its Paris its Paris
 And the leaves are growing green

The suns gone in the sparkles dead
 There falls a dash of rain
But who would care when such an air
 Comes blowing up the Seine
And still Ninette sits sewing
 Beside her windowpane
When its Paris its Paris
 And springtimes come again




 Madeira from the Sea


Out of the delicate dream of the distance an emerald emerges
Veiled in the violet folds of the air of the sea
Softly the dream grows awakeningshimmering white of a city
Splashes of crimson the gay bougainvillea the palms
High in the infinite blue of its heaven a quiet cloud lingers
Lost and forgotten of winds that have fallen asleep
Fallen asleep to the tune of a Portuguese song in a garden




 City Vignettes


 I
 Dawn

The greenish sky glows up in misty reds
 The purple shadows turn to brick and stone
The dreams wear thin men turn upon their beds
 And hear the milkcart jangle by alone


 II
 Dusk

The citys street a roaring blackened stream
 Walled in by granite thro whose thousand eyes
A thousand yellow lights begin to gleam
 And over all the pale untroubled skies


 III
 Rain at Night

The streetlamps shine in a yellow line
 Down the splashy gleaming street
And the rain is heard now loud now blurred
 By the tread of homing feet




 By the Sea


Beside an ebbing northern sea
While stars awaken one by one
We walk together I and he

He woos me with an easy grace
That proves him only half sincere
A light smile flickers on his face

To him lovemaking is an art
And as a flutist plays a flute
So does he play upon his heart

A music varied to his whim
He has no use for love of mine
He would not have me answer him

To hide my eyes within the night
I watch the changeful lighthouse gleam
Alternately with red and white

My laughter smites upon my ears
So one who cries and wakes from sleep
Knows not it is himself he hears

What if my voice should let him know
The mocking words were all a sham
And lips that laugh could tremble so

What if I lost the power to lie
And he should only hear his name
In one low broken cry




 On the Death of Swinburne


He trod the earth but yesterday
And now he treads the stars
 He left us in the April time
 He praised so often in his rhyme
He left the singing and the lyre and went his way

He drew new music from our tongue
A music subtly wrought
 And moulded words to his desire
 As wind doth mould a wave of fire
From strangely fashioned harps slow golden tones he wrung

I think the singing understands
That he who sang is still
 And Iseult cries that he is dead
 Does not Dolores bow her head
And Fragoletta weep and wring her little hands

New singing now the singer hears
To lyre and lute and harp
 Catullus waits to welcome him
 And thro the twilight sweet and dim
Sapphos forgotten songs are falling on his ears




 Triolets


 I

Love looked back as he took his flight
 And lo his eyes were filled with tears
Was it for love of lost delight
Love looked back as he took his flight
Only I know while day grew night
 Turning still to the vanished years
Love looked back as he took his flight
 And lo his eyes were filled with tears


 II
 Written in a copy of La Vita Nuova For M C S

If you were Lady Beatrice
 And I the Florentine
Id never waste my time like this
If you were Lady Beatrice
Id woo and then demand a kiss
 Nor weep like Dante here I ween
If you were Lady Beatrice
 And I the Florentine


 III
 Written in a copy of The Poems of Sappho

Beyond the dim Hesperides
 The girl who sang them long ago
Could never dream that over seas
Beyond the dim Hesperides
The wind would blow such songs as these
 I wonder now if she can know
Beyond the dim Hesperides
 The girl who sang them long ago


 IV

Dead leaves upon the stream
 And dead leaves on the air
All of my lost hopes seem
Dead leaves upon the stream
I watch them in a dream
 Going I know not where
Dead leaves upon the stream
 And dead leaves on the air




 Vox Corporis


The beast to the beast is calling
 And the soul bends down to wait
Like the stealthy lord of the jungle
 The white man calls his mate

The beast to the beast is calling
 They rush through the twilight sweet
But the soul is a wary hunter
 He will not let them meet




 A Ballad of Two Knights


Two knights rode forth at early dawn
 Aseeking maids to wed
Said one My lady must be fair
 With gold hair on her head

Then spake the other knightatarms
 I care not for her face
But she I love must be a dove
 For purity and grace

And each knight blew upon his horn
 And went his separate way
And each knight found a ladylove
 Before the fall of day

But she was brown who should have had
 The shining yellow hair
I ween the knights forgot their words
 Or else they ceased to care

For he who wanted purity
 Brought home a wanton wild
And when each saw the other knight
 I ween that each knight smiled




 Christmas Carol


The kings they came from out the south
 All dressed in ermine fine
They bore Him gold and chrysoprase
 And gifts of precious wine

The shepherds came from out the north
 Their coats were brown and old
They brought Him little newborn lambs
 They had not any gold

The wisemen came from out the east
 And they were wrapped in white
The star that led them all the way
 Did glorify the night

The angels came from heaven high
 And they were clad with wings
And lo they brought a joyful song
 The host of heaven sings

The kings they knocked upon the door
 The wisemen entered in
The shepherds followed after them
 To hear the song begin

And Mary held the little child
 And sat upon the ground
She looked up she looked down
 She looked all around

The angels sang thro all the night
 Until the rising sun
But little Jesus fell asleep
 Before the song was done




 The Faery Forest


The faery forest glimmered
 Beneath an ivory moon
The silver grasses shimmered
 Against a faery tune

Beneath the silken silence
 The crystal branches slept
And dreaming thro the dewfall
 The cold white blossoms wept




 A Fantasy


Her voice is like clear water
 That drips upon a stone
In forests far and silent
 Where Quiet plays alone

Her thoughts are like the lotus
 Abloom by sacred streams
Beneath the temple arches
 Where Quiet sits and dreams

Her kisses are the roses
 That glow while dusk is deep
In Persian garden closes
 Where Quiet falls asleep




 A Minuet of Mozarts


Across the dimly lighted room
 The violin drew wefts of sound
 Airily they wove and wound
And glimmered gold against the gloom

I watched the music turn to light
 But at the pausing of the bow
 The web was broken and the glow
Was drowned within the wave of night




 Twilight


Dreamily over the roofs
 The cold spring rain is falling
Out in the lonely tree
 A bird is calling calling

Slowly over the earth
 The wings of night are falling
My heart like the bird in the tree
 Is calling calling calling




 The Prayer


My answered prayer came up to me
 And in the silence thus spake he
O you who prayed for me to come
 Your greeting is but cold and dumb

My heart made answer You are fair
 But I have prayed too long to care
Why came you not when all was new
 And I had died for joy of you




 Two Songs for a Child


 I
 Grandfathers Love

They said he sent his love to me
 They wouldnt put it in my hand
And when I asked them where it was
 They said I couldnt understand

I thought they must have hidden it
 I hunted for it all the day
And when I told them so at night
 They smiled and turned their heads away

They say that love is something kind
 That I can never see or touch
I wish hed sent me something else
 I like his coughdrops twice as much


 II
 The Kind Moon

I think the moon is very kind
 To take such trouble just for me
He came along with me from home
 To keep me company

He went as fast as I could run
 I wonder how he crossed the sky
Im sure he hasnt legs and feet
 Or any wings to fly

Yet here he is above their roof
 Perhaps he thinks it isnt right
For me to go so far alone
 Tho mother said I might




On the Tower



Under the leaf of many a Fable lies the Truth for those who look for it
 Jami



On the Tower

A play in one act


The Knight
The Lady

Voices of men and women on the ground at the foot of the tower
The voice of the Knights Page



 The top of a high battlemented tower of a castle A stone ledge
 which serves as a seat extends part way around the parapet
 Small clouds float by in the blue sky and occasionally a swallow
 passes
 Entrance R from an unseen stairway which is supposed to extend
 around the outside of the tower


The Lady unseen
 Oh do not climb so fast for I am faint
 With looking down the tower to where the earth
 Lies dreaming in the sun I fear to fall

The Knight unseen
 Lean on me love my love and look not down

L
 Call me not love call me your conquered foe
 That now since you have battered down her gates
 Gives you the keys that lock the highest tower
 And mounts with you to prove her homage true
 Oh bid me go no farther lest I fall
 My foot has slipped upon the rainworn stones
 Why are the stairs so narrow and so steep
 Let us go back my lord

K
 Are you afraid
 Who were so dauntless till the walls gave way
 Courage my sweet I would that I could climb
 A thousand times by windswept stairs like these
 That lead so near to heaven

L
 Sir you may
 You are a knight and very valorous
 I am a woman I shall never come
 This way but once
 The Knight and the Lady appear on the top of the tower

K
 Kiss me at last my love

L
 Oh my sweet lord I am too tired to kiss
 Look how the earth is like an emerald
 With rivers veined and flawed with fallow fields

K Lifting her veil
 Then I kiss you a thousand thousand kisses
 For all the days ere I had won to you
 Beyond the walls and gates you barred so close
 Call me at last your love your castles lord

L After a pause
 I love you

 She kisses him Her veil blows away like a white butterfly
 over the parapet Faint cries and laughter from men and women
 under the tower

Men and Women
 The veil the ladys veil

 The knight takes the lady in his arms

L
 My lord I pray you loose me from your arms
 Lest that my people see how much we love

K
 May they not see us All of them have loved

L
 But you have been an enemy my lord
 With walls between us and with mossgrown moats
 Now on a sudden must I kiss your mouth
 I who was taught before I learned to speak
 That all my house was hostile unto yours
 Now can I put my head against your breast
 Here in the sight of all who choose to come

K
 Are we not past the caring for their eyes
 And nearer to the heaven than to earth
 Look up and see

L
 I only see your face

 She touches his hair with her hands Murmuring under the tower

K
 Why came we here in all the noonday light
 With only darting swallows over us
 To make a speck of darkness on the sun
 Let us go down where walls will shut us round
 Your castle has a hundred quiet halls
 A hundred chambers where the shadows lie
 On things put by forgotten long ago
 Forgotten lutes with strings that Time has slackened
 We two shall draw them close and bid them sing
 Forgotten games forgotten books still open
 Where you had laid them by at vespertime
 And your embroidery whereon halfworked
 Weeps Amor wounded by a roses thorn
 Shall I not see the room in which you slept
 Palpitant still and breathing of your thoughts
 Where maiden dreams adown the ways of sleep
 Swept noiselessly with damosels and knights
 To tourneys where the trumpet made no sound
 Blow as he might the scarlet trumpeter
 And were the dreams not sometimes brimmed with tears
 That waked you when the night was loneliest
 Will you not bring me to your oratory
 Where prayers arose like little birds set free
 Still upward upward without sound of flight
 Shall I not find your turrets toward the north
 Where you defied white winter armed for war
 Your southern casements where the sun blows in
 Between the leafbent boughs the wind has lifted
 Shall we not see the sunrise toward the east
 Watch dawn by dawn the rose of day unfolding
 Its goldenhearted beauty sovereignly
 And toward the west look quietly at evening
 Shall I not see all these and all your treasures
 In carven coffers hidden in the dark
 Have you not laid a sapphire lit with flame
 And amethysts set round with deepwrought gold
 Perhaps a ruby

L
 All my gems are yours
 And all my chambers curtained from the sun
 My lord shall see them all in time in time


 The sun begins to sink

K
 Shall I not see them now Today tonight

L
 How could I show you in one day my lord
 My castle and my treasures and my tower
 Let all the days to come suffice for this
 Since all the past days made them what they are
 You will not be impatient my sweet lord
 Some of the halls have long been locked and barred
 And some have secret doors and hard to find
 Till suddenly you touch them unawares
 And down a sable way runs silver light
 We two will search together for the keys
 But not today Let us sit here today
 Since all is yours and always will be yours

 The stars appear faintly one by one

K After a pause
 I grow a little drowsy with the dusk

L Singing
 There was a man that loved a maid
 Sleep and take your rest
 Over her lips his kiss was laid
 Over her heart his breast

 The knight sleeps

 All of his vows were sweet to hear
 Sweet was his kiss to take
 Why was her breast so quick to fear
 Why was her heart to break

 Why was the man so glad to woo
 Sleep and take your rest
 Why were the maidens words so few

 She sees that he is asleep and slipping off her long cloaklike
 outer garment she pillows his head upon it against the parapet
 and half kneeling at his feet she sings very softly

 I love you I love you I love you
 I am the flower at your feet
 The birds and the stars are above you
 My place is more sweet

 The birds and the stars are above you
 They envy the flower in the grass
 For I only I while I love you
 Can die as you pass

 Light clouds veil the stars growing denser constantly
 The castle bell rings for vespers and rising the lady moves
 to a corner of the parapet and kneels there

L
 Ave Maria gratia plena Dominus

Voice of the Page from the foot of the tower
 My lord my lord they call for you at court

 The knight wakes It is now quite dark

 There is a tourney toward your enemy
 Has challenged you My lord make haste to come

 The knight rises and gropes his way toward the stairs

K
 I will make haste Await me where you are

 To himself
 There was a lady on this tower with me

 He glances around hurriedly but does not see her in the darkness

Page
 My lord has far to ride before the dawn

K To himself
 Why should I tarry

 To the page
 Bring my horse and shield

 He descends As the noise of his footfall on the stairs dies away
 the lady gropes toward the stairway then turns suddenly and going to
 the ledge where they have sat she throws herself over the parapet

End of Helen of Troy And Other Poems




Sara Teasdale

Sara Teasdale was born in St Louis Missouri where she attended a
school that was founded by the grandfather of another great poet from
St LouisT S Eliot She later associated herself more with New
York City Her first book of poems was Sonnets to Duse 1907 but
Helen of Troy 1911 was the true launch of her career followed by
Rivers to the Sea 1915 Love Songs 1917 Flame and Shadow
1920 and more Her final volume Strange Victory is considered
by many to be predictive of her suicide

It is interesting to note that in Teasdales Collected Works about
half of the poems in this volumesome more justly than othershave
been excluded and most of the rest have been slightly changed Most
of the poems from this volume which were selected to be included in
Love Songs also had some minor changes This edition preserves the
original readings but they are not to be considered authoritative
