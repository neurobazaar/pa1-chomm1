SHAVINGS

CHAPTER I


Mr Gabriel Bearse was happy The prominence given to this
statement is not meant to imply that Gabriel was as a general
rule unhappy Quite the contrary Mr Bearses disposition was a
cheerful one and the cares of this world had not rounded his plump
shoulders But Captain Sam Hunniwell had once said and Orham
public opinion agreed with him that Gabe Bearse was never happy
unless he was talking Now here was Gabriel not talking but
walking briskly along the Orham main road and yet so distinctly
happy that the happiness showed in his gait his manner and in the
excited glitter of his watery eye Truly an astonishing condition
of things and tending one would say to prove that Captain Sams
didactic remark so long locally accepted and quoted as gospel
truth had a flaw in its wisdom somewhere

And yet the flaw was but a small one and the explanation simple
Gabriel was not talking at that moment it is true but he was
expecting to talk very soon to talk a great deal He had just
come into possession of an item of news which would furnish his
vocal machine gun with ammunition sufficient for wordy volley after
volley Gabriel was joyfully contemplating peppering all Orham
with that bit of gossip No wonder he was happy no wonder he
hurried along the main road like a battery galloping eagerly into
action

He was on his way to the post office always the gossip
sharpshooters first line trench when turning the corner where
Nickersons Lane enters the main road he saw something which
caused him to pause alter his battlemad walk to a slower one
then to a saunter and finally to a halt altogether This
something was a toy windmill fastened to a white picket fence and
clattering cheerfully as its arms spun in the brisk pleasant
summer breeze

The little windmill was one of a dozen all fastened to the top
rail of that fence and all whirling Behind the fence on posts
were other and larger windmills behind these others larger still
Interspersed among the mills were little wooden sailors swinging
paddles weather vanes in the shapes of wooden whales swordfish
ducks crows seagulls circles of little wooden profile sailboats
made to chase each other round and round a central post All of
these were painted in gay colors or in black and white and all
were in motion The mills spun the boats sailed round and
round the sailors did vigorous Indian club exercises with their
paddles The grass in the little yard and the tall hollyhocks in
the beds at its sides swayed and bowed and nodded Beyond seen
over the edge of the bluff and stretching to the horizon the blue
and white waves leaped and danced and sparkled As a picture of
movement and color and joyful bustle the scene was inspiring
children viewing it for the first time almost invariably danced
and waved their arms in sympathy Summer visitors loitering idly
by suddenly became fired with the desire to set about doing
something something energetic

Gabriel Bearse was not a summer visitor but a native that is
an alltheyearround resident of Orham and as his fellow natives
would have cheerfully testified it took much more than windmills
to arouse HIS energy He had not halted to look at the mills He
had stopped because the sight of them recalled to his mind the fact
that the maker of these mills was a friend of one of the men most
concerned in his brand new news item It was possible barely
possible that here was an opportunity to learn just a little more
to obtain an additional clip of cartridges before opening fire on
the crowd at the post office Certainly it might be worth trying
particularly as the afternoon mail would not be ready for another
hour even if the train was on time

At the rear of the little yard and situated perhaps fifty feet
from the edge of the high sand bluff leading down precipitously to
the beach was a shingled building whitewashed and with a door
painted green and four windows on the side toward the road A
clamshell walk led from the gate to the doors Over the door was a
sign very neatly lettered as follows J EDGAR W WINSLOW
MILLS FOR SALE In the lot next to that where the little shop
stood was a small oldfashioned storyandahalf Cape Cod house
painted a speckless white with vivid green blinds The blinds
were shut now for the house was unoccupied House and shop and
both yards were neat and clean as a New England kitchen

Gabriel Bearse after a moments reflection opened the gate in the
picket fence and walked along the clamshell walk to the shop door
Opening the door he entered a bell attached to the top of the
door jingling as he did so The room which Mr Bearse entered was
crowded from floor to ceiling save for a narrow passage with hit
ormiss stacks of the wooden toys evidently finished and ready for
shipment Threading his way between the heaps of sailors mills
vanes and boats Gabriel came to a door evidently leading to
another room There was a sign tacked to this door which read
PRIVATE but Mr Bearse did not let that trouble him He pushed
the door open

The second room was evidently the workshop There were a circular
saw and a turning lathe with the needful belts and a small
electric motor to furnish power Also there were piles of lumber
shelves of paint pots and brushes many shavings and much sawdust
And standing beside a dilapidated chair from which he had
evidently risen at the sound of the door bell with a dripping
paint brush in one hand and a wooden sailor in the other there was
a man When he saw who his visitor was he sat down again

He was a tall man and as the chair he sat in was a low one and the
heels of his large shoes were hooked over its lower rounds his
knees and shoulders were close together when he bent over his work
He was a thin man and his trousers hung about his ankles like a
loose sail on a yard His hair was thick and plentiful a brown
sprinkled with gray at the temples His face was smoothshaven
with wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and mouth He wore
spectacles perched at the very end of his nose and looked down
over rather than through them as he dipped the brush in the can of
paint beside him on the floor

Hello Shavins hailed Mr Bearse blithely

The tall man applied the brush to the nude pine legs of the wooden
sailor One side of those legs were modestly covered forthwith by
a pair of skyblue breeches The artist regarded the breeches
dreamily Then he said

Hello Gab

His voice was a drawl very deliberate very quiet rather soft and
pleasant But Mr Bearse was not pleased

Dont call me that he snapped

The brush was again dipped in the paint pot and the rear elevation
of the pine sailor became skyblue like the other side of him
Then the tall man asked

Call you what

Gab Thats a divil of a name to call anybody Last time I was
in here Capn Sam Hunniwell heard you call me that and I callated
hed die laughin Seemed to callate there was somethin
specially dum funny about it I dont call it funny Say
speakin of Capn Sam have you heard the news about him

He asked the question eagerly because it was a part of what he
came there to ask His eagerness was not contagious The man on
the chair put down the blue brush took up a fresh one dipped it
in another paint pot and proceeded to garb another section of his
sailor in a spotless white shirt Mr Bearse grew impatient

Have you heard the news about Capn Sam he repeated Say
Shavins have you

The painting went serenely on but the painter answered

Well Gab he drawled I

Dont call me Gab I tell you Taint my name

Sho Aint it

You know well enough taint My names Gabriel Call me that
or Gabe I dont like to be called out of my name But say
Shavins

Well Gab say it

Look here Jed Winslow do you hear me

Yes hear you fust rate Gabenow

Mr Bearses understanding was not easily penetrated a hint
usually glanced from it like a piece of soap from a slanting cellar
door but this time the speakers tone and the emphasis on the
now made a slight dent Gabriels eyes opened

Huh he grunted in astonishment as if the possibility had never
until that moment occured to him Why say Jed dont you like
to be called Shavins

No answer A blue collar was added to the white shirt of the
sailor

Dont you Jed repeated Gabe

Mr Winslows gaze was lifted from his work and his eyes turned
momentarily in the direction of his caller

Gabe he drawled did you ever hear about the feller that was
born stone deef and the Doxology

Eh What No I never heard it

The eyes turned back to the wooden sailor and Mr Winslow chose
another brush

Neither did he he observed and began to whistle what sounded
like a dirge

Mr Bearse stared at him for at least a minute Then he shook his
head

Well by Judas he exclaimed III snum if I dont think you
BE crazy same as some folks say you are What in the nation has
has your name got to do with a deef man and the Doxology

Eh    Oh nothin

Then what did you bust loose and tell me about em for They
want any of MY business was they

Noo Thats why I spoke of em

What You spoke of em cause they want any of my business

Yees    I thought maybe He paused turned the sailor over
in his hand whistled a few more bars of the dirge and then
finished his sentence I thought maybe you might like to ask
questions about em he concluded

Mr Bearse stared suspiciously at his companion swallowed several
times and between swallows started to speak but each time gave
it up Mr Winslow appeared quite oblivious of the stare His
brushes gave the wooden sailor black hair eyes and brows and an
engaging crimson smile When Gabriel did speak it was not
concerning names

Say Jed he cried HAVE you heard about Capn Sam Hunniwell
Bout his bein put on the Exemption Board

His companion went on whistling but he nodded

Umhm grunted Gabe grudgingly I presumed likely you would
hear he told you himself I callate Seth Baker said he see him
come in here night afore last and I suppose thats when he told
you Didnt say nothin else did he he added eagerly

Again Mr Winslow nodded

Did he Did he What else did he say

The tall man seemed to consider

Well he drawled at length seems to me I remember him sayin
sayin

Yes Yes What did he say

Wellerseems to me he said good night just afore he went home

The disappointed Gabriel lost patience Oh you DIVILISH fool
head he exclaimed disgustedly Look here Jed Winslow talk
sense for a minute if you can wont you Ive just heard
somethin thats goin to make a big row in this town and its got
to do with Capn Sams bein appinted on that Govment Exemption
Board for drafted folks If youd heard Phineas Babbitt goin on
the way I done I guess likely youd have been interested

It was plain that for the first time since his caller intruded
upon his privacy the maker of mills and sailors WAS interested
He did not put down his brush but he turned his head to look and
listen Bearse pleased with this symptom of attention went on

I was just into Phineas store he said and he was there so I
had a chance to talk with him Hes been up to Boston and never
got back till this afternoon so I callated maybe he hadnt heard
about Capn Sams appintment And I knew too how he does hate
the Capn aint had nothin but cuss words and such names for him
ever since Sam done him out of gettin the postmasters job
Pretty mean trick some folks call it but

Mr Winslow interrupted his drawl was a trifle less evident

Congressman Taylor asked Sam for the truth regardin Phineas and a
certain matter he said Sam told the truth thats all

Well maybe thats so but does tellin the truth about folks make
em love you I dont know as it does

Winslow appeared to meditate

Noo he observed thoughtfully I dont suppose you do

No I    Eh What do you mean by that Look here Jed
Winslow if

Jed held up a big hand There there Gabe he suggested
mildly Lets hear about Sam and Phin Babbitt What was Phineas
goin on about when you was in his store

Mr Bearse forgot personal grievance in his eagerness to tell the
story

Why he began you see twas like this Twas all on account of
Leander Leanders been drafted You know that of course

Jed nodded Leander Babbitt was the son of Phineas Babbitt
Orhams dealer in hardware and lumber and a leading political boss
Between Babbitt Senior and Captain Sam Hunniwell the latter
President of the Orham National Bank and also a vigorous
politician the dislike had always been strong Since the affair
of the postmastership it had become on Babbitts part an intense
hatred During the week just past young Babbitts name had been
drawn as one of Orhams quota for the new National Army The
village was still talking of the draft when the news came that
Captain Hunniwell had been selected as a member of the Exemption
Board for the district the Board which was to hold its sessions at
Ostable and listen to the pleas of those desiring to be excused
from service Not all of Orham knew this as yet Jed Winslow had
heard it from Captain Sam himself Gabe Bearse had heard it
because he made it his business to hear everything whether it
concerned him or notpreferably not

The war had come to Orham with the unbelievable unreality with
which it had come to the great mass of the country Ever since the
news of the descent of von Klucks hordes upon devoted Belgium in
the fall of 1914 the death grapple in Europe had of course been
the principal topic of discussion at the post office and around the
whist tables at the Setuckit Club where ancient and retired
mariners met and pounded their own and each others knees while
they expressed sulphurous opinions concerning the attitude of the
President and Congress These opinions were as a usual thing
guided by the fact of their holders allegiance to one or the other
of the great political parties Captain Sam Hunniwell a lifelong
and ardent Republican with a temper as peppery as the chile con
carne upon which when commander of a steam freighter trading with
Mexico he had feasted so oftenCaptain Sam would have hoisted the
Stars and Stripes to the masthead the day the Lusitania sank and
put to sea in a dory if need be and armed only with a shotgun to
avenge that outrage To hear Captain Sam orate concerning the
neglect of duty of which he considered the United States government
guilty was an experience interesting or shocking according to the
drift of ones political or religious creed

Phineas Babbitt on the contrary had at first upheld the policy of
strict neutrality What business is it of ours if them furriners
take to slaughterin themselves he wanted to know He hotly
declared the Lusitania victims plaguey fools who knew what they
were riskin when they sailed and had got just what was comin to
emthat is he was proclaiming it when Captain Sam heard him
after that the captain issued a proclamation of his own and was
proceeding to follow words with deeds The affair ended by mutual
acquaintances leading Captain Sam from the Babbitt Hardware
Companys store the captain rumbling like a volcano and to follow
up the simile still emitting verbal brimstone and molten lava
while Mr Babbitt entrenched behind his counter with a monkey
wrench in his hand dared his adversary to lay hands on a law
abiding citizen

When the Kaiser and von Tirpitz issued their final ultimatum
however and the President called America to arms Phineas in
company with others of his breed appeared to have experienced a
change of heart At all events he kept his antiwar opinions to
himself and except that his hatred for the captain was more
virulent than ever since the affair of the postmastership he found
little fault with the war preparations in the village the
organizing of a Home Guard the raising of funds for a new flag and
flagpole and the recruiting meeting in the town hall

At that meeting a half dozen of Orhams best young fellows had
expressed their desire to fight for Uncle Sam The Orham band
minus its first cornet who was himself one of the volunteershad
serenaded them at the railway station and the Congregational
minister and Lawyer Poundberry of the Board of Selectmen had made
speeches Captain Sam Hunniwell being called upon to say a few
words had said a fewperhaps considering the feelings of the
minister and the feminine members of his flock present it is well
they were not more numerous

Good luck to you boys said Captain Sam I wish to the
Almighty I was young enough to go with you And say if you see
that Kaiser anywheres afloat or ashore give him particular merry
hell for me will you

And then a little later came the news that the conscription bill
had become a law and that the draft was to be a reality And with
that news the war itself became a little more real And suddenly
Phineas Babbitt realizing that his son Leander was twentyfive
years old and therefore within the limits of the draft age
became once more an ardent if a little more careful conscientious
objector

He discovered that the war was a profiteering enterprise engineered
by capital and greed for the exploiting of labor and the common
people Whenever he thought it safe to do so he aired these
opinions and as there were a few of what Captain Hunniwell called
yellowbacked swabs in Orham or its neighborhood he occasionally
had sympathetic listeners Phineas it is only fair to say had
never heretofore shown any marked interest in labor except to get
as much of it for as little money as possible If his son
Leander shared his fathers opinions he did not express them In
fact he said very little working steadily in the store all day and
appearing to have something on his mind Most people liked
Leander

Then came the draft and Leander was drafted He said very little
about it but his father said a great deal The boy should not go
the affair was an outrage Leander wasnt strong anyway besides
wasnt he his fathers principal support He couldnt be spared
thats all there was about it and he shouldnt be There was
going to be an Exemption Board wasnt there All rightjust wait
until he Phineas went before that board He hadnt been in
politics all these years for nothin Sam Hunniwell hadnt got all
the pull there was in the county

And then Captain Sam was appointed a member of that very board He
had dropped in at the windmill shop the very evening when he
decided to accept and told Jed Winslow all about it There never
were two people more unlike than Sam Hunniwell and Jed Winslow but
they had been fast friends since boyhood Jed knew that Phineas
Babbitt had been on a trip to Boston and therefore had not heard
of the captains appointment Now according to Gabriel Bearse he
had returned and had heard of it and according to Bearses excited
statement he had gone on about it

Leanders been drafted repeated Gabe And that was bad enough
for Phineas he bein down on the war anyhow But hes been
callatin I callate to use his political pull to get Leander
exempted off Nine boards out of ten if theyd had a man from
Orham on em would have gone by what that man said in a case like
Leanders And Phineas he was movin heavens and earth to get one
of his friends put on as the right Orham man And nowNOW by
godfreys domino theyve put on the ONE man that Phin cant
influence that hates Phin worse than a cat hates a swim Oh you
ought to heard Phineas go on when I told him Hed just got off
the train as you might say so nobodyd had a chance to tell him
I was the fust one you see So

Was Leander there

No he want There want nobody in the store but Susie Ellis
that keeps the books there now and Abner Burgesss boy that runs
errands and waits on folks when everybody else is busy That was a
funny thing toothat about Leanders not bein there Susie said
she hadnt seen him since just after breakfast time half past
seven oclock or so and when she telephoned the Babbitt house it
turned out he hadnt been there neither Had his breakfast and
went out he did and thats all his stepma knew about him But
Phineas he    Eh Aint that the bell Customer I presume
likely Want me to go see who tis ShavinsJed I mean


CHAPTER II


But the person who had entered the outer shop saved Mr Bearse the
trouble He too disregarded the Private sign on the door of
the inner room Before Gabriel could reach it that door was thrown
open and the newcomer entered He was a big man graymustached
with hair a grizzled red and with blue eyes set in a florid face
The hand which had opened the door looked big and powerful enough
to have knocked a hole in it if such a procedure had been
necessary And its owner looked quite capable of doing it if he
deemed it necessary in fact he looked as if he would rather have
enjoyed it He swept into the room like a northwest breeze and
two bundles of wooden strips cut to the size of mill arms
clattered to the floor as he did so

Hello Jed he hailed in a voice which measured up to the rest
of him Then noticing Mr Bearse for the first time he added
Hello Gabe what are you doin here

Gabriel hastened to explain His habitual desire to please and
humor each person he meteach person of consequence that is very
poor people or village eccentrics like Jed Winslow did not much
matter of coursewas in this case augmented by a particular
desire to please Captain Sam Hunniwell Captain Sam being one of
Orhams most influential men was not in Mr Bearses estimation
at all the sort of person whom it was advisable to displease He
mightand didtalk disparagingly of him behind his back as he
did behind the back of every one else but he smiled humbly and
spoke softly in his presence The consciousness of having just
been talking of him however of having visited that shop for the
express purpose of talking about him made the explaining process a
trifle embarrassing

Oh howdye do howdye do Capn Hunniwell stammered Gabriel
Nice day aint it sir Yes sir tis a nice day I was just
erthat is I just run in to see Shavins here to make a little
call you know We was just settin here talkin want we
ShavinsJed I mean

Mr Winslow stood his completed sailor man in a rack to dry

Yaas he drawled solemnly that was about it I guess Have a
chair Sam wont you    That was about it we was sittin and
talkin    I was sittin and GabGabe I meanwas talkin

Captain Sam chuckled As Winslow and Mr Bearse were occupying the
only two chairs in the room he accepted the invitation in its broad
sense and turning an empty box upon end sat down on that

So Gabe was talkin eh he repeated Well thats singular
Howd that happen Gabe

Mr Bearse looked rather foolish Oh we was justjust talkin
abouterthis and that he said hastily Just this and that
nothin particlar Callate Ill have to be runnin along now
Jed

Jed Winslow selected a new and unpainted sailor from the pile near
him He eyed it dreamily

Well Gabe he observed if you must you must I suppose
Seems to me youre leavin at the most interestin time Weve
been talkin about this and that same as you say and now youre
leavin just as this has got here Maybe if you waitwaita

The sentence died away into nothingness He had taken up the brush
which he used for the blue paint There was a loose bristle in it
He pulled this out and one or two more came with it

Huum he mused absently

Captain Sam was tired of waiting

Come finish her out Jedfinish her out he urged Whats the
rest of it

I callate Ill run along now said Mr Bearse nervously moving
toward the door

Hold on a minute commanded the captain Jed hadnt finished
what he was sayin to you He generally talks like one of those
continuedinournext yarns in the magazines Give us the
September installment Jedcome

Mr Winslow smiled a slow whimsical smile that lit up his lean
brown face and then passed away as slowly as it had come lingering
for an instant at one corner of his mouth

Oh I was just tellin Gabe that the this he was talkin about
was here now he said and that maybe if he waited a space the
that would come too Seems to me if I was you Gabe Id

But Mr Bearse had gone

Captain Hunniwell snorted Humph he said I judge likely Im
the this you and that gas bag have been talkin about Whos the
that

His companion was gazing absently at the door through which Gabriel
had made his hurried departure After gazing at it in silence for
a moment he rose from the chair unfolding section by section like
a pocket rule and crossing the room opened the door and took
from its other side the lettered sign Private which had hung
there Then with tacks and a hammer he proceeded to affix the
placard to the inner side of the door that facing the room where
he and Captain Sam were The captain regarded this operation with
huge astonishment

Gracious king he exclaimed What in thunder are you doin that
for This is the private room in here aint it

Mr Winslow returning to his chair nodded

Yaas he admitted thats why Im puttin the Private sign on
this side of the door

Yes but Why confound it anybody who sees it there will think
it is the other room thats private wont they

Jed nodded Im in hopes they will he said

Youre in hopes they will Why

Cause if Gabe Bearse thinks that rooms private and that he dont
belong there hell be sartin sure to go there then maybe hell
give me a rest

He selected a new brush and went on with his painting Captain
Hunniwell laughed heartily Then all at once his laughter ceased
and his face assumed a troubled expression

Jed he ordered leave off daubin at that wooden doll baby for
a minute will you I want to talk to you I want to ask you what
you think Id better do I know what Gab Bearse Much obliged
for that name Jed Gabs the best name on earth for that
critterI know what Gab came in here to talk about Twas about
me and my bein put on the Exemption Board of course That was
it want it Umhm I knew twas I was the this in his this
and that And Phin Babbitt was the that Ill bet on it Am I
right

Winslow nodded

Sure thing continued the captain Well there tis What am I
goin to do When they wanted me to take the job in the first
place I kind of hesitated You know I did Twas bound to be one
of those thankless sort of jobs that get a feller into trouble
bound to be And yetand yetwell SOMEBODY has to take those
kind of jobs And a man hadnt ought to talk all the time about
how he wishes he could do somethin to help his country and then
lay down and quit on the first chance that comes his way just
cause that chance aintaint eatin up all the pie in the state
so the Germans cant get it or somethin like that Aint that
so

Seems so to me Sam

Yes Well so I said Id take my Exemption Board job But when I
said Id accept it it didnt run across my mind that Leander
Babbitt was liable to be drafted first crack out of the box Now
he IS drafted and if I know Phin Babbitt the old man will be
down on us Board fellers the first thing to get the boy exempted
AND I bein on the Board and hailin from his own town Orham
here it would naturally be to me that hed come first Eh
Thats what hed naturally do aint it

His friend nodded once more Captain Sam lost patience

Gracious king he exclaimed Jed Winslow for thunder sakes say
somethin Dont set there bobbin your head up and down like one
of those woundup images in a Christmastime store window I ask
you if that aint what Phin Babbitt would do What would you do if
you was in his shoes

Jed rubbed his chin

Step out of em I guess likely he drawled

Humph Yeswell any selfrespectin person would do that even
if he had to go barefooted the rest of his life But what Im
gettin at is this Babbittll come to me orderin me to get
Leander exempted And whatll I say

Winslow turned and looked at him

Seems to me Sam he answered that if that thing happened
thered be only one thing to say Youd just have to tell him that
youd listen to his reasons and if they seemed good enough to let
the boy off for your part youd vote to let him off If they
didnt seem good enoughwhy

Wellwhat

Why then Leanderd have to go to war and his dad could go to

Eh Go on I want to hear you say it Where could he go

Jed wiped the surplus paint from his brush on the edge of the can

To sellin hardware he concluded gravely but with a twinkle in
his eye

Captain Sam sniffed perhaps in disappointment His hardwared
melt where ID tell him to go he declared What you say is all
right Ed Its an easy doctrine to preach but like lots of
other preachers doctrines its hard to live up to Phin loves me
like a stepbrother and I love him the same way Well now here he
comes to ask me to do a favor for him If I dont do it hell
say and the whole townll say that Im ventin my spite on him
keepin on with my grudge bein nasty cussed everything thats
mean If I do do it if I let Leander off all handsll say that I
did it because I was afraid of Phineas and the rest would say the
other thing It puts me in a devil of a position Its all right
to say Do your duty Stand up in your shoes Do what you
thinks right never mind whose boy tis and all that but I
wouldnt have that old skunk goin around sayin I took advantage
of my position to rob him of his son for anything on earth I
despise him too much to give him that much satisfaction And yet
there I am and the casell come up afore me Whatll I do Jed
Shall I resign Help me out Im about crazy Shall I heave up
the job Shall I quit

Jed put down the brush and the sailor man He rubbed his chin

Noo he drawled after a moment

Oh I shant eh Why not

Cause you dont know how Sam It always seemed to me that it
took a lot of practice to be a quitter You never practiced

Thanks All right then Im to hang on I suppose and take my
medicine If thats all the advice youve got to give me I might
as well have stayed at home But I tell you this Jed Winslow If
Id realizedif Id thought about the Leander Babbitt case comin
up afore me on that Board I never would have accepted the
appointment When you and I were talkin here the other night its
queer that neither of us thought of it    Eh What are you
lookin at me like that for You dont mean to tell me that YOU DID
think of it Did you

Winslow nodded

Yes he said I thought of it

You DID Well I swear Then why in thunder didnt you

He was interrupted The bell attached to the door of the outer
shop rang The maker of windmills rose jerkily to his feet
Captain Sam made a gesture of impatience

Get rid of your customer and come back here soon as you can he
ordered Having commanded a steamer before he left the sea and
become a banker the captain usually ordered rather than requested
Hurry all you can I aint half through talkin with you For
the land sakes MOVE Of all the deliberate slow travelin

He did not finish his sentence nor did Winslow who had started
toward the door have time to reach it The door was opened and a
short thickset man with a leathery face and a bristling yellow
white chin beard burst into the room At the sight of its
occupants he uttered a grunt of satisfaction and his bushy brows
were drawn together above his little eyes the latter a washedout
gray and set very close together

Humph he snarled vindictively So you BE here Gabe Bearse
said you was but I thought probably he was lyin as usual Did
he lie about the other thing thats what Ive come here to find
out Sam Hunniwell have you been put on that Draft Exemption
Board

Yes he said curtly I have

The man trembled all over

You have he cried raising his voice almost to a scream

Yes I have Whats it matter to you Phin Babbitt Seems to
have het you up some that or somethin else

Het me up By Mr Phineas Babbitt swore steadily for a full
minute When he stopped for breath Jed Winslow who had stepped
over and was looking out of the window uttered an observation

Im afraid I made a mistake changin that sign he said
musingly I callate Ill make another Prayer meetins must be
held outside

By began Mr Babbitt again but this time it was Captain Sam
who interrupted The captain occasionally swore at other people
but he was not accustomed to be sworn at He too began to heat
up He rose to his feet

Thatll do Babbitt he commanded Whats the matter with you
Is it me youre cussin Because if it is

The little Babbitt eyes snapped defiance

If it is what he demanded But before the captain could reply
Winslow turning away from the window did so for him

If it is I should say twas a pretty complete job he drawled
I dont know when Ive heard fewer things left out You have
reason to be proud both of you And now Phineas he went on
whats it all about Whats the matter

Mr Babbitt waved his fists again preparatory to another outburst
Jed laid a big hand on his shoulder

Dont seem to me time for the benediction yet Phineas he said
Ought to preach your sermon or sing a hymn first seems so What
did you come here for

Phineas Babbitts hard gray eyes looked up into the big brown ones
gazing mildly down upon him His gaze shifted and his tone when he
next spoke was a trifle less savage

He knows well enough what I came here for he growled indicating
Hunniwell with a jerk of his thumb He knows that just as well as
he knows why he had himself put on that Exemption Board

I didnt have myself put there declared the captain The job
was wished on me Lord knows I didnt want it I was just tellin
Jed here that very thing

Wished on you nothin You planned to get it and you worked to
get it and I know why you did it too Twas to get another crack
at me Twas to play another dirty trick on me like the one you
played that cheated me out of the post office You knew theyd
drafted my boy and you wanted to make sure he didnt get clear
You

Thatll do Captain Hunniwell seized him by the shoulder
Thats enough cried the captain Your boy had nothin to do
with it I never thought of his name bein drawn when I said Id
accept the job

You lie

WHAT Why you little sawedoff driedup sassy son of a sea
cook Ill

Winslows lanky form was interposed between the pair and his slow
gentle drawl made itself heard

Im sorry to interrupt the experience meetin he said but IVE
got a call to testify and I feel the spirit aworkin Set down
again Sam will you please Phineas you set down over there
Please set down both of you Sam as a favor to me

But the captain was not in a favorextending mood He glowered at
his adversary and remained standing

Phin begged Winslow But Mr Babbitt although a trifle paler
than when he entered the shop was not more yielding

Im particular who I set down along of he declared Id as
soon set down with aa rattlesnake as I would with some humans

Captain Sam was not pale far from it

Skunks are always afraid of snakes they tell me he observed
tartly A rattlesnakes honest anyhow and he aint afraid to
bite He aint all bad smell and nothin else

Babbitts bristling chin beard quivered with inarticulate hatred
Winslow sighed resignedly

Well he asked you dont mind the otherercritter in the
menagerie sittin do you Nownownow just a minute he
pleaded as his two companions showed symptoms of speaking
simultaneously Just a minute let me say a word Phineas I
judge the only reason you have for objectin to the captains bein
on the Exemption Board is on account of your son aint it Its
just on Leanders account

But before the furious Mr Babbitt could answer there came another
interruption The bell attached to the door of the outer shop rang
once more Jed who had accepted his own invitation to sit rose
again with a groan

Now I wonder who THAT is he drawled in mild surprise

Captain Hunniwells frayed patience never noted for long
endurance snapped again Gracious king go and find out he
roared Whoever tis ll die of old age before you get there

The slow smile drifted over Mr Winslows face Probably if I
wait and give em a chance theyll come in here and have apoplexy
instead he said That seems to be the fashionable disease this
afternoon They wont stay out there and be lonesome theyll come
in here where its private and theres a crowd Eh Yes here
they come

But the newest visitor did not come like the others uninvited
into the private room Instead he knocked on its door When
Winslow opened it he saw a small boy with a yellow envelope in his
hand

Hello Josiah hailed Jed genially Hows the president of the
Western Union these days

The boy grinned bashfully and opined the magnate just mentioned was
all right Then he added

Is Mr Babbitt here Mr BearseMr Gabe Bearseis over at the
office and he said he saw Mr Babbitt come in here

Yes hes here Want to see him do you

Ive got a telegram for him

Mr Babbitt himself came forward and took the yellow envelope
After absently turning it over several times as so many people do
when they receive an unexpected letter or message he tore it open

Winslow and Captain Sam watching him saw his face to which the
color had returned in the last few minutes grow white again He
staggered a little Jed stepped toward him

What is it Phin he asked Somebody dead or

Babbitt waved him away No he gasped chokingly No let me
be ImIm all right

Captain Sam a little consciencestricken came forward Are you
sick Phin he asked Is there anything I can do

Phineas glowered at him Yes he snarled between his clenched
teeth you can mind your own darned business

Then turning to the boy who had brought the message he ordered
You get out of here

The frightened youngster scuttled away and Babbitt the telegram
rattling in his shaking hand followed him The captain hurrying
to the window saw him go down the walk and along the road in the
direction of his store He walked like a man stricken

Captain Sam turned back again Now what in time was in that
telegram he demanded Jed standing with his back toward him and
looking out of the window on the side of the shop toward the sea
did not answer

Do you hear me asked the captain That telegram struck him
like a shock of paralysis He went all to pieces What on earth
do you suppose was in it Eh Why dont you say somethin YOU
dont know what was in it do you

Winslow shook his head No he answered I dont knows I do

You dont know as you do Well do you GUESS you do Jed
Winslow what have you got up your sleeve

The proprietor of the windmill shop slowly turned and faced him
I dont knows theres anything there Sam he answered but
but I shouldnt be much surprised if that telegram was from
Leander

Leander Leander Babbitt What    Eh What in thunder do
YOU want

The last question was directed toward the window on the street side
of the shop Mr Gabriel Bearse was standing on the outside of
that window energetically thumping on the glass

Open her up Open her up commanded Gabe Ive got somethin
to tell you

Captain Sam opened the window Gabriels face was aglow with
excitement Say Say he cried Did he tell you Did he tell
you

Did who tell what demanded the captain

Did Phin Babbitt tell you what was in that telegram he just got
What did he say when he read it Did he swear I bet he did If
that telegram want some surprise to old Babbitt then

Do you know what twaswhat the telegram was

Do I You bet you I do And Im the only one in this town except
Phin and Jim Bailey that does know I was in the telegraph office
when Jim took it over the wire I see Jim was pretty excited
Well says he if this wont be some jolt to old Phin he says
What will says I Why says he

What was it demanded Captain Sam Youre dyin to tell us a
blind man could see that Get it off your chest and save your
life What was it

Mr Bearse leaned forward and whispered There was no real reason
why he should whisper but doing so added a mysterious
confidential tang so to speak to the value of his news

Twas from Leanderfrom Phins own boy Leander Babbitt twas
Twas from him up in Boston and it went somethin like this Have
enlisted in the infantry Made up my mind best thing to do Will
not be back Have written particulars That was it or pretty
nigh it Leanders enlisted Never waited for no Exemption Board
nor nothin but went up and enlisted on his own hook without
tellin a soul he was goin to Thats the way Bailey and me
figger it up Say aint that some news Godfreys I must hustle
back to the post office and tell the gang afore anybody else gets
ahead of me So long

He hurried away on his joyful errand Captain Hunniwell closed the
window and turned to face his friend

Do you suppose thats true Jed he asked Do you suppose it
CAN be true

Jed nodded Shouldnt be surprised he said

Good gracious king Do you mean the boy went off up to Boston on
his own hook as that whatshisnameGabsays and volunteered
and got himself enlisted into the army

Shouldnt wonder Sam

Well my gracious king Whywhyno wonder old Babbitt looked as
if the main topsail yard had fell on him Tut tut tut Well I
declare Now what do you suppose put him up to doin that

Winslow sat down in his low chair again and picked up the wooden
sailor and the paint brush

Well Sam he said slowly Leanders a pretty good boy

Yes I suppose he is but hes Phin Babbitts son

I know but dont it seem to you as if some sorts of fathers was
like birthmarks and bow legs they come early in life and a feller
aint to blame for havin em Sam you aint sorry the boys
volunteered are you

Sorry I should say not For one thing his doin it makes my job
on the Exemption Board a mighty sight easier There wont be any
row there with Phineas now

Noo I thought twould help that But that want the whole
reason Sam

Reason for what What do you mean

I mean that want my whole reason for tellin Leander hed better
volunteer better go up to Boston and enlist same as he did That
was part but twant all

Captain Sams eyes and mouth opened He stared at the speaker in
amazement

You told him to volunteer he repeated You told him to go to
Boston and YOU did What on earth

Jeds brush moved slowly down the wooden legs of his sailor man

Leander and I are pretty good friends he explained I like him
and heerhumIm afraid that paints kind of thick Callate
Ill have to thin it a little

Captain Sam condemned the paint to an eternal blister

Go on go on he commanded What about you and Leander Finish
her out Cant you see youve got my head whirlin like one of
those windmills of yours Finish her OUT

Jed looked over his spectacles

Oh he said Well Leanders been comin in here pretty
frequent and weve talked about his affairs a good deal Hes
always wanted to enlist ever since the war broke out

He HAS

Why sartin Just the same as you would oror I hope I would
if I was young andand with a wistful smile different and
likely to be any good to Uncle Sam Yes Leanders been anxious to
go to war but his dad was so set against it all and kept hollerin
so about the boys bein needed in the store that Leander didnt
hardly know what to do But then when he was drawn on the draft
list he came in here and he and I had a long talk Twas
yesterday after youd told me about bein put on the Board you
know I could see the trouble thered be between you and Phineas
andandwell you see Sam I just kind of wanted that boy to
volunteer II dont know why but He looked up from his work
and stared dreamily out of the window I guess maybe twas
because Ive been wishin so that I could go myselfordo
SOMETHIN that was some good So Leander and I talked and finally
he said Well by George I WILL go Andandwell I guess
thats all he went you see

The captain drew a long breath

He went he repeated And you knew hed gone

No I didnt know but I kind of guessed

You guessed and yet all the time Ive been here you havent said
a word about it till this minute

Well I didnt think twas much use sayin until I knew

Well my gracious king Jed Winslow you beat all my goin to sea
But youve helped Uncle Sam to a good soldier and youve helped me
out of a nasty row For my part Im everlastin obliged to you I
am so

Jed looked pleased but very much embarrassed

Sho sho he exclaimed hastily twant anything Oh say
hastily changing the subject Ive got some money round here
somewheres I thought maybe youd take to the bank and deposit for
me next time you went if twant too much trouble

Trouble Course taint any trouble Where is it

Winslow put down his work and began to hunt From one drawer of
his work bench amid nails tools and huddles of papers he
produced a small bundle of banknotes from another drawer another
bundle These however did not seem to satisfy him entirely At
last after a good deal of very deliberate search he unearthed
more paper currency from the pocket of a dirty pair of overalls
hanging on a nail and emptied a heap of silver and coppers from a
battered can on the shelf Captain Hunniwell muttering to
himself watched the collecting process When it was completed he
asked

Is this all

Eh Yes I guess tis I cant seem to find any more just now
Maybe another batchll turn up later If it does Ill keep it till
next time

The captain suppressing his emotions hastily counted the money

Have you any idea how much there is here he asked

No I dont knows I have Theres been quite considerble comin
in last fortnit or so Summer folks been payin bills and one
thing or nother Might be forty or fifty dollars I presume
likely

Forty or fifty Nearer a hundred and fifty And you keep it
stuffed around in every junk hole from the roof to the cellar
Wonder to me you dont light your pipe with it I shouldnt wonder
if you did How many times have I told you to deposit your money
every three days anyhow How many times

Mr Winslow seemed to reflect

Dont know Sam he admitted Good many I will give in But
but you see Sam ifif I take it to the bank Im liable to
forget Ive got it Longs its round here somewheres Iwhy I
know where tis andand its handy See dont you

The captain shook his head

Jed Winslow he declared as I said to you just now you beat all
my goin to sea I cant make you out When I see how you act
with money and business and how you let folks take advantage of
you then I think youre a plain dum fool And yet when you bob up
and do somethin like gettin Leander Babbitt to volunteer and
gettin me out of that row with his father thenwell then Im
ready to swear youre as wise as King Solomon ever was Youre a
puzzle to me Jed What are you anywaythe dum fool or King
Solomon

Jed looked meditatively over his spectacles The slow smile
twitched the corners of his lips

Well Sam he drawled if you put it to vote at town meetin I
callate the majorityd be all one way But I dont know he
paused and then added I dont know Sam but its just as well
as tis A King Solomon down here in Orham would be an awful
lonesome cuss


CHAPTER III


Upon a late September day fortynine years and some months before
that upon which Gabe Bearse came to Jed Winslows windmill shop in
Orham with the news of Leander Babbitts enlistment Miss Floretta
Thompson came to that village to teach the downstairs school
Miss Thompson was an orphan Her father had kept a small drug
store in a town in western Massachusetts Her mother had been a
clergymans daughter Both had died when she was in her teens
Now at twenty she came to Cape Cod pale slim with a wealth of
light brown hair and a pair of large dreamy brown eyes Her taste
in dress was peculiar even eccentric and Orham soon discovered
that she herself was also somewhat eccentric

As a schoolteacher she was not an unqualified success The
downstairs curriculum was not extensive nor very exacting but it
was supposed to impart to the boys and girls of from seven to
twelve a rudimentary knowledge of the three Rs and of geography
In the first two Rs readin and ritin Miss Thompson was
proficient She wrote a flowery Spencerian which was beautifully
shaded and looked well on the blackboard and reading was the
dissipation of her spare moments The third R rithmetic she
loathed

Youth even at the ages of from seven to twelve is only too
proficient in learning to evade hard work The fact that Teacher
took no delight in traveling the prosaic highways of addition
multiplication and division but could be easily lured to wander
the flowery lanes of romantic fiction was soon grasped by the
downstairs pupils The hour set for recitation by the first class
in arithmetic was often and often monopolized by a holdover of the
first class in reading while Miss Floretta artfully spurred by
questions asked by the older scholars rhapsodized on the beauties
of James Fenimore Coopers Uncas or Dickens Little Nell or
Scotts Ellen Some of us antiques then towheaded little
shavers in the front seats can still remember Miss Florettas
rendition of the lines

And SaxonI am Roderick Dhu

The extremely genteel not to say ladylike elocution of the
Highland chief and the indescribable rising inflection and emphasis
on the I

These literary rambles had their inevitable effect an effect
noted after a time and called to the attention of the school
committee by old Captain Lycurgus Batcheldor whose two
grandchildren were among the ramblers

Say demanded Captain Lycurgus how old does a youngone have to
be afore its supposed to know how much four times eight is My
Sarahs Nathan is pretty nigh ten and HE dont know it Gave me
three answers he did first that twas fortyeight then that twas
eightyfour and then that hed forgot what twas But I noticed he
could tell me a whole string about some feller called Lockintar or
Lochinvar or some such outlandish name and not only his name but
where he came from which was out west somewheres A poetry piece
twas Nate said the teacherd been speakin it to em I aint
got no objection to speakin pieces but I do object to bein told
that four times eight is eightyfour specially when Im buyin
codfish at eight cents a pound I aint on the school committee
but if I was

So the committee investigated and when Miss Thompsons year was up
and the question arose as to her reengagement there was
considerable hesitancy But the situation was relieved in a most
unexpected fashion Thaddeus Winslow first mate on the clipper
ship Owners Favorite at home from a voyage to the Dutch East
Indies fell in love with Miss Floretta proposed was accepted and
married her

It was an odd match Floretta pale polite impractical and
intensely romantic Thad florid rough and to the point Yet the
married pair seemed to be happy together Winslow went to sea on
several voyages and four years after the marriage remained at
home for what for him was a long time During that time a child
a boy was born

The story of the christening of that child is one of Orhams pet
yarns even to this day It seems that there was a marked
disagreement concerning the name to be given him Captain Thad had
had an Uncle Edgar who had been very kind to him when a boy The
captain wished to name his own youngster after this uncle But
Florettas heart was set upon Wilfred her favorite hero of
romance being Wilfred of Ivanhoe The story is that the parents
being no nearer an agreement on the great question Floretta made a
proposal of compromise She proposed that her husband take up his
stand by the bedroom window and the first male person he saw
passing on the sidewalk below the name of that person should be
given to their offspring a sporting proposition certainly But
the story goes on to detract a bit from the sporting element by
explaining that Mrs Winslow was expecting a call at that hour from
the Baptist minister and the Baptist ministers Christian name was
Clarence which if not quite as romantic as Wilfred is by no
means common and prosaic Captain Thad who had not been informed
of the expected ministerial call and was something of a sport
himself assented to the arrangement It was solemnly agreed that
the name of the first male passerby should be the name of the new
Winslow The captain took up his post of observation at the window
and waited

He did not have to wait long Unfortunately for romance the
Reverend Clarence was detained at the home of another parishioner a
trifle longer than he had planned and the first masculine to pass
the Winslow home was old Jedidah Wingate the fish peddler Mrs
Diadama Busteed who was acting as nurse in the family and had been
sworn in as witness to the agreement between husband and wife
declared to the day of her death that that death was hastened by
the shock to her nervous and moral system caused by Captain Thads
language when old Jedidah hove in sight He vowed over and over
again that he would be everlastingly condemned if he would label a
youngone of his with such a crashetyblankblanked outrage of a
name as Jedidah Jedidiah was bad enough but there WERE a few
Jedidiahs in Ostable County whereas there was but one Jedidah
Mrs Winslow who did not fancy Jedidah any more than her husband
did wept Captain Thads profanity impregnated the air with
brimstone But they had solemnly sworn to the agreement and Mrs
Busteed had witnessed it and an oath is an oath Besides Mrs
Winslow was inclined to think the whole matter guided by Fate and
being superstitious as well as romantic feared dire calamity if
Fate was interfered with It ended in a compromise and a
fortnight later the Reverend Clarence keeping his countenance
with difficulty christened a redfaced and protesting infant
Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow

Jedidah Edgar Wilfred grew up At first he was called Edgar by
his father and Wilfred by his mother His teachers day school
and Sunday school called him one or the other as suited their
individual fancies But his schoolmates and playfellows knowing
that he hated the name above all else on earth gleefully hailed
him as Jedidah By the time he was ten he was Jed Winslow
beyond hope of recovery Also it was settled locally that he was
queernot cracked or lacking which would have implied that
his brain was affectedbut just queer which meant that his ways
of thinking and acting were different from those of Orham in
general

His father Captain Thaddeus died when Jed was fifteen just
through the grammar school and ready to enter the high He did not
enter instead the need of money being pressing he went to work
in one of the local stores selling behind the counter If his
father had lived he would probably have gone away after finishing
high school and perhaps if by that time the mechanical ability
which he possessed had shown itself he might even have gone to
some technical school or college In that case Jed Winslows
career might have been very very different But instead he went
to selling groceries boots shoes dry goods and notions for Mr
Seth Wingate old Jedidahs younger brother

As a grocery clerk Jed was not a success neither did he shine as a
clerk in the post office nor as an assistant to the local
expressman In desperation he began to learn the carpenters trade
and because he liked to handle tools did pretty well at it But
he continued to be queer and his absentminded dreaminess was in
evidence even then

I snum I dont know what to make of him declared Mr Abijah
Mullett who was the youths boss Never know just what hes
goin to do or just what hes goin to say I says to him
yesterday Jed says I you do pretty well with tools and wood
considerin what little experience youve had Did Capn Thad
teach you some or did you pick it up yourself He never answered
for a minute or so seemed to be way off dreamin in the next
county somewheres Then he looked at me with them big eyes of his
and he drawled out Comes natural to me Mr Mullett I guess he
says There seems to be a sort of family feelin between my head
and a chunk of wood Now what kind of an answer was that I want
to know

Jed worked at carpentering for a number of years sometimes going
as far away as Ostable to obtain employment And then his mother
was seized with the illness from which so she said she never
recovered It is true that Doctor Parker the Orham physician
declared that she had recovered or might recover if she cared to
Which of the pair was right does not really matter At all events
Mrs Winslow whether she recovered or not never walked abroad
again She was up and about as they say in Orham and did some
housework after a fashion but she never again set foot across the
granite doorstep of the Winslow cottage Probably the poor womans
mind was slightly affected it is charitable to hope that it was
It seems the only reasonable excuse for the oddity of her behavior
during the last twenty years of her life for her growing
querulousness and selfishness and for the exacting slavery in which
she kept her only son

During those twenty years whatever ambition Jedidah Edgar Wilfred
may once have had was thoroughly crushed His mother would not
hear of his leaving her to find better work or to obtain promotion
She needed him she wailed he was her life her all she should
die if he left her Some hardhearted townspeople Captain
Hunniwell among them disgustedly opined that in view of such a
result Jed should be forcibly kidnaped forthwith for the general
betterment of the community But Jed himself never rebelled He
cheerfully gave up his youth and early middle age to his mother and
waited upon her ran her errands sat beside her practically every
evening and read romance after romance aloud for her benefit And
his queerness developed as under such circumstances it was bound
to do

Money had to be earned and as the invalid would not permit him to
leave her to earn it it was necessary to find ways of earning it
at home Jed did odd jobs of carpentering and cabinet making went
fishing sometimes worked in gardens between times did almost
anything in fact to bring in the needed dollars And when he was
thirtyeight years old he made and sold his first Cape Cod Winslow
windmill the forerunner of the thousands to follow That mill
made in some of his rare idle moments and given to the child of a
wealthy summer visitor made a hit The child liked it and other
children wanted mills just like it Then grownups among the
summer folk took up the craze Winslow mills became the fad
Jed built his little shop or the first installment of it

Mrs Floretta Winslow died when her son was forty A merciful
release Captain Sam and the rest called it but to Jed it was a
stunning shock He had no one to take care of now except himself
and he did not know what to do He moped about like a deserted
cat Finally he decided that he could not live in the old house
where he was born and had lived all his life He expressed his
feelings concerning that house to his nearest friend practically
his sole confidant Captain Sam

I cant somehow seem to stand it Sam he said solemnly I
cant stay in that house alone any longer itsits too
sociable

The captain who had expected almost anything but that stared at
him

Sociable he repeated Youre sailin stern first Jed
Lonesomes what you mean of course

Jed shook his head

Noo he drawled I mean sociable Theres too many boys in
there for one thing

Boys Captain Sam was beginning to be really alarmed now
Boys Saysay Jed Winslow you come along home to dinner with
me I bet youve forgot to eat anything for the last day or so
been inventin some new kind of whirlagig or otherand your empty
stomachs gone to your head and made it dizzy Boys Gracious
king Come on home with me

Jed smiled his slow smile I dont mean real boys Sam he
explained I mean meIm the boys Nights now when Im walkin
around in that house alone I meet myself comin round every corner
Me when I was five comin out of the buttery with a cooky in each
fist and me when I was ten sittin studyin my lesson book in the
corner and me when I was fifteen just afore Father died sittin
all alone thinkin what Id do when I went to Boston Tech same as
he said he was callatin to send me Then

He paused and lapsed into one of his fits of musing His friend
drew a breath of relief

Oh he exclaimed Well I dont mind your meetin yourself I
thought first youd gone off your head blessed if I didnt
Youre a queer critter Jed Get those funny notions from readin
so many books I guess likely Meetin yourself What an idea
that is I suppose you mean that bein alone in that house where
youve lived since you was born you naturally get to thinkin
about what used to be

Jed stared wistfully at the back of a chair

Umhm he murmured and what might have beenandand aint

The captain nodded Of all the people in Orham he he prided
himself was the only one who thoroughly understood Jed Winslow
And sometimes he did partially understand him this was one of the
times

Nownownow he said hastily dont you get to frettin
yourself about your not amountin to anything and all that Youve
got a nice little trade of your own buildin up here What more do
you want We cant all beerKnowitalls like Shakespeare or
or rich as Standard Oil Companies can we Look here what do you
waste your time goin back twentyfive years and meetin yourself
for Why dont you look ahead ten or fifteen and try to meet
yourself then You may be a millionaire aerwindmill trust or
somethin of that kind by that time Eh Ha ha

Jed rubbed his chin

When I meet myself lookin like a millionaire he observed
gravely Ill have to do the way you do at your bank Samcall in
somebody to identify me

Captain Sam laughed Well anyhow he said dont talk any more
foolishness about not livin in your own house If I was you

Mr Winslow interrupted Sam he said the way to find out what
you would do if you was me is to make sure WHAT youd doand then
do tother thing or somethin worse

Oh Jed be reasonable

Jed looked over his spectacles Sam he drawled if I was
reasonable I wouldnt be me

And he lived no longer in the old house Having made up his mind
he built a small tworoom addition to his workshop and lived in
that Later he added a sleeping rooma sort of loftand a little
covered porch on the side toward the sea Here in pleasant summer
twilights or on moonlight nights he sat and smoked He had a good
many callers and but few real friends Most of the townspeople
liked him but almost all considered him a joke an oddity a
specimen to be pointed out to those of the summer people who were
looking for types A few like Mr Gabriel Bearse who
distinctly did NOT understand him and who found his solemn
suggestions and pointed repartee irritating at times were inclined
to refer to him in these moments of irritation as town crank
But they did not really mean it when they said it And some
others like Leander Babbitt or Captain Hunniwell came to ask his
advice on personal matters although even they patronized him just
a little He had various nicknames Shavings being the most
popular

His peculiar business the making of wooden mills toys and weather
vanes had grown steadily Now he shipped many boxes of these to
other seashore and mountain resorts He might have doubled his
output had he chosen to employ help or to enlarge his plant but he
would not do so He had rented the old Winslow house furnished
once to a summer tenant but he never did so again although he had
many opportunities He lived alone in the addition to the little
workshop cooking his own meals making his own bed and sewing on
his own buttons

And on the day following that upon which Leander Babbitt enrolled
to fight for Uncle Sam Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow was forty
five years old

He was conscious of that fact when he arose It was a pleasant
morning the sun was rising over the notched horizon of the
tumbling ocean the breeze was blowing the surf on the bar was
frothing and roaring cheerilyand it was his birthday The
morning the sunrise the surf and all the rest were pleasant to
contemplatehis age was not So he decided not to contemplate it
Instead he went out and hoisted at the top of the short pole on the
edge of the bluff the flag he had set there on the day when the
United States declared war against the Hun He hoisted it every
fine morning and he took it in every night

He stood for a moment watching the red white and blue flapping
bravely in the morning sunshine then he went back into his little
kitchen at the rear of the workshop and set about cooking his
breakfast The kitchen was about as big as a goodsized packing
box and Jed standing over the oilstove could reach any shelf in
sight without moving He cooked his oatmeal porridge boiled his
egg and then sat down at the table in the next roomhis combined
living and diningroom and not very much bigger than the kitchen
to eat When he had finished he washed the dishes walked up to
the post office for the mail and then entering the workshop took
up the paint brush and the top sailorman of the pile beside him
and began work This except on Sundays was his usual morning
routine It varied little except that he occasionally sawed or
whittled instead of painted or less occasionally still boxed
some of his wares for shipment

During the forenoon he had some visitors A group of summer people
from the hotel came in and after pawing over and displacing about
half of the movable stock bought ten or fifteen dollars worth and
departed Mr Winslow had the satisfaction of hearing them burst
into a shout of laughter as they emerged into the yard and the
shrill voice of one of the females in the party rose above the
hilarity with Isnt he the WEIRDEST thing And an accompanying
male voice appraised him as Some guy believe me Soome guy
Jed winced a little but he went on with his painting On ones
fortyfifth birthday one has acquired or should have acquired a
certain measure of philosophical resignation

Other customers or lookers came and went Maud Hunniwell Captain
Sams daughter dropped in on her way to the post office The
captain was a widower and Maud was his only child She was
therefore more than the apple of his eye she was a whole orchard
of apples She was eighteen pretty and vivacious and her father
made a thorough job of spoiling her Not that the spoiling had
injured her to any great extent it had not as yet but that was
Captain Sams good luck Maud was wearing a new dressshe had a
new one every week or soand she came into the windmill shop to
show it Of course she would have denied that that was the reason
for her coming but the statement stands nevertheless She and
Jed were great chums and had been since she could walk She liked
him took his part when she heard him criticized or made fun of
and was always prettily confidential and friendly when they were
alone together Of course there was a touch of superiority and
patronage in her friendship She should not be blamed for this
all Orham consciously or unconsciously patronized Jed Winslow

She came into the inner shop and sat down upon the same upturned
box upon which her father had sat the afternoon before Her first
remark after good mornings had been exchanged was concerning
the Private sign on the inner side of the door

What in the world have you put that sign inside here for she
demanded

Mr Winslow explained taking his own deliberate time in making the
explanation Miss Hunniwell wrinkled her dainty upturned nose and
burst into a trill of laughter

Oh thats lovely she declared and just like you besides
And do you think Gabe Bearse will go back into the other room when
he sees it

Jed looked dreamily over his spectacles at the sign I dont
know he drawled If I thought hed go wherever that sign was I
aint sure but Id tack it on the cover of the well out in the yard
yonder

His fair visitor laughed again Why Jed she exclaimed You
wouldnt want to drown him would you

Jed seemed to reflect Noo he answered slowly dont knows
I wouldnot in my well anyhow

Miss Hunniwell declared that that was all nonsense You wouldnt
drown a kitten she said I know that because when Mrs
Nathaniel Rogers old white cat brought all her kittens over here
the first of this summer you wouldnt even put them out in the yard
at night to say nothing of drowning them All six and the mother
cat stayed here and fairly swarmed over you and ate you out of
house and home Father said he believed they fed at the first
table and you were taking what was left It was a mercy the old
cat decided to lead them back to the Rogers again or I dont know
WHAT might have become of you by this time

Jed seemed to be thinking there was a reminiscent twinkle in his
eye

The old cat didnt lead em back he said Nathaniel took em
back Didnt I ever tell you about that

No you didnt You KNOW you didnt Mr Rogers took them back
I cant believe it He told everywhere about town that he was glad
to get rid of the whole family and as you and the cats seemed to
be mutually happy together he wasnt going to disturb you He
thought it was a great joke on you And he took them back himself
Why

Mr Winslow rubbed his chin I dont knows Id ought to say
anything about it he said I havent afore I wouldnt
interfere with Nates sales for anything

Sales Sales of what Oh you mean thing Dont be so
provoking Tell me the whole story this minute

Jed painted a moment or two Then he said Weell Maud you see
those kittens got to be kind of a nuisance They was cunnin and
cute and all that but they was so everlastin lively and hungry
that they didnt give me much of a chance I was only one you
see and they had a majority vote every time on who should have the
bed and the chairs and the table and one thing or nother If I
sat down I sat on a cat If I went to bed I laid down on cats and
when I turned them out and turned in myself they came and laid down
on ME I slept under fur blankets most of June And as for
eatin Well every time I cooked meat or fish they sat down in a
circle and whooped for some When I took it off the fire and put
it in a plate on the table I had to put another plate and aa
plane or somethin heavy on top of it or theyd have had it sartin
sure Then when I sat down to eat it they formed a circle again
like a reglar band and tuned up and hollered Lord amercy HOW
they did holler And if one of the kittens stopped run out of
wind or got a sore throat or anything the old cat would bite it to
set it goin again She want goin to have any shirkin in HER
orchestra I ate to music as you might say same as Ive read
they do up to Boston restaurants And about everything I did eat
was stuffed with cats hairs Seemed sometimes as if those kittens
was solid fur all the way through they never could have shed all
that hair from the outside Somebody told me that kittens never
shed hair twas only full grown cats did that I dont believe
it Nate Rogers old maltee never shed all that alone allowin
her a half barrel there was all of another barrel spread around
the premises Noo those cats was a good deal of a nuisance
Umhm    Yes they was   

He paused and apparently having forgotten that he was in the
middle of a story began to whistle lugubriously and to bend all
his other energies to painting Miss Hunniwell who had laughed
until her eyes were misty wiped them with her handkerchief and
commanded him to go on

Tell me the rest of it she insisted How did you get rid of
them How did Mr Rogers come to take them back

Eh    Oh why you see I went over to Nates three or four
times and told him his cat and kittens were here and I didnt feel
right to deprive him of em any longer He said never mind I
could keep em long as I wanted to I said that was about as long
as I had kept em Then he said he didnt knows he cared about
ever havin em again said he and his wife had kind of lost their
taste for cats seemed so Iwell I hinted that long as the
tribe was at my house I want likely to have a chance to taste much
of anything but it didnt seem to have much effect Then

Yes yes go on go on

Oh    Then one day Nate he happened to be in herecome to
borrow somethin some tool seems to me twasand the cats was
climbin round promiscuous same as usual And one of the summer
women came in while he was here wanted a mill for her little niece
or somethin And she saw one of the animals and she dropped
everything else and sang out Oh what a beautiful kitten What
unusual coloring May I see it Course she was seein it
already but I judged she meant could she handle it so I tried to
haul the critter loose from my legthere was generally one or more
of em shinnin over me somewhere It squalled when I took hold of
it and she says Oh it doesnt want to come does it It must
have a very affectionate disposition to be so attached to you
Seemed to me twas attached by its claws moren its disposition
but I pried it loose and handed it to her Then she says again
What unusual colorin Will you sell this one to me Ill give
you five dollars for it

He stopped again Another reminder from Miss Hunniwell was
necessary to make him continue

And you sold one of those kittens for five dollars she cried

Noo

You didnt Why you foolish man Why not

I never had a chance Afore I could say a word Nate Rogers spoke
up and said the kittens belonged to him Then she saw another one
that she hadnt seen afore and she says Oh that one has more
unusual colorins even than this I never saw such color in a
cat Course she meant ON a cat but we understood what she meant
Are they a very rare breed she asked Nate said they was and

Miss Hunniwell interrupted But they werent were they she
cried I never knew they were anything more than plain tabby

Jed shook his head Nate said they was he went on solemnly
He said they were awful rare Then she wanted to know would he
sell one for five dollars He said no he couldnt think of it

Why the greedy old thing

And so he and she had it back and forth and finally they struck a
bargain at seven dollars for the one that looked most like a crazy
quilt

Seven dollars for a CAT What color was it for goodness sake

Oh all kinds seemed so Black and white and maltee and blue and
red and green

Green What ARE you talking about Who ever saw a green cat

This woman saw one that was part green and she bought it Then
she said shed take it right along in her car Said she had a
friend that was as loony about cats as she was and she was goin to
fetch her right down the very next day And a couple of hours
after shed gone Nate and his boy came back with a clothes basket
with a board over the top and loaded in the balance of the family
and went off with em I aint seen a hair of em sinceno I
wont say that quite but I aint seen THEM

And didnt he give you any of the seven dollars

Noo

But you had been feeding those kittens and their mother for weeks

Yees

But didnt you ASK for anything

Well I told Nate he might maybe leave one of the kittens sos I
could have aersouvenir of the visit but he wouldnt do it
Said those kittens was rare anderprecious or words to that
effect He didnt intend to let another go as cheap as he had that
one

Oh    I see I remember now I heard some one saying
something early in July about the sign on the Rogers front
fence Rare Cats for Sale they said it was I think Of
course I never thought of THOSE kittens He must have sold them
all for the sign isnt there now

Jed whistled a few bars I dont hardly think hes sold em he
said I presume likely hes just gone out of the business

I dont see why he shouldnt sell them Green cats ought to sell
quickly enough I should think Were they green honest and truly
Jed

Mr Winslow nodded

They were that mornin he drawled solemnly

That morning What do you mean

Well you see Maud those kittens were into everything and over
everything most of the time Four of em had got in here early
afore I came downstairs that day and had been playin hide and hoot
amongst my paint pots They was green in spots sure enough but I
had my doubts as to its bein fast color

Maud laughed joyfully over the secret of the green pussies

I wish I might have seen that womans face after the colors began
to wear off her rare kitten she said

Jed smiled slightly Nathan saw it he said I understood he
had to take back the kitten and give up the seven dollars He
dont hardly speak to me nowadays Seems to think twas my fault
I dont hardly think twas do you

Miss Hunniwells call lasted almost an hour Besides a general
chat concerning Leander Babbits voluntary enlistment the subject
which all Orham had discussed since the previous afternoon she had
a fresh bit of news The government had leased a large section of
land along the bay at East Harniss the next village to Orham and
seven or eight miles distant and there was to be a military
aviation camp there

Oh its true she declared emphatically Father has known
that the Army people have been thinking of it for some time but it
was really decided and the leases signed only last Saturday They
will begin building the barracks and the buildingstheoh what
do they call those big sheds they keep the aeroplanes in

The hangars said Winslow promptly

Yes thats it They will begin building those right away She
paused and looked at him curiously How did you know they called
them hangars Jed she asked

Eh    Oh Ive read about em in the newspapers thats
all    Huum    So well have aeroplanes flyin around
here pretty soon I suppose Well well

Yes And therell be lots and lots of the flying menthe what
doyoucallemsaviators and officers in uniformand all sorts
What fun Im just crazy about uniforms

Her eyes snapped Jed in his quiet way seemed excited too He
was gazing absently out of the window as if he saw in fancy a
procession of aircraft flying over Orham flats

Theyll be flyin up out there he said musingly And Ill see
emI will Sho

Miss Hunniwell regarded him mischievously Jed she asked
would you like to be an aviator

Jeds answer was solemnly given Im afraid I shouldnt be much
good at the job he drawled

His visitor burst into another laugh He looked at her over his
glasses

What is it he asked

Oh nothing II was just thinking of you in a uniform thats
all

Jed smiled his slow fleeting smile

I guess likely I would be pretty funny he admitted Any
Germans I met would probably die laughin and that might help along
some

But after Miss Hunniwell had gone he sat for some minutes gazing
out of the window the wistful dreamy look on his lean homely
face Then he sighed and resumed his painting

That afternoon about half past five he was still at his task
when hearing the doorbell ring he rose and went into the front
shop To his astonishment the shop was empty He looked about for
the expected customer or caller whoever he or she might be and
saw no one He stepped to the window and looked out but there was
no one on the steps or in the yard He made up his mind that he
must have dreamed of the bellringing and was turning back to the
inner room when a voice said

Please are you the windmill man

Jed started turned again and stared about him

Please sir here I am said the voice

Jed looking down instead of up or on a level saw his visitor
then That is he saw a tumbled shock of curls and a pair of big
round eyes looking up at him over a stock of weather vanes

Hello he exclaimed in surprise

The curls and eyes came out from behind the stack of vanes They
were parts of a little girl and the little girl made him a demure
little courtesy

How do you do she said

Jed regarded her in silence for a moment Then Why Im fair to
middlin smart just at present he drawled How do YOU find
yourself today

The young ladys answer was prompt and to the point Im nicely
thank you she replied and added I was sick at my stomach
yesterday though

This bit of personal information being quite unexpected Mr
Winslow scarcely knew what comment to make in reply to it

Sho he exclaimed Was you though

Yes Mamma says she is clined to think it was the two whole
bananas and the choclate creams but I think it was the fried
potatoes I was sick twiceno three times Please I asked you
something Are you the windmill man

Jed by this time very much amused looked her over once more She
was a pretty little thing although just at this time it is
doubtful if any of her family or those closely associated with her
would have admitted it Her face was not too clean her frock was
soiled and mussed her curls had been blown into a tangle and there
were smooches Jed guessed them to be blackberry stains on her
hands around her mouth and even across her small nose She had a
doll its raiment in about the same condition as her own tucked
under one arm Hat she had none

Mr Winslow inspected her in his accustomed deliberate fashion

Guess youve been havin a pretty good time havent you he
inquired

The small visitors answer was given with dignity

Yes she said Will you please tell me if you are the windmill
man

Jed accepted the snub with outward humility and inward appreciation

Why yes he admitted I presume likely Im the windmill man
Is there anything I can do for you this evenin

Apparently there was for the child untucking the doll from
beneath her right arm and tucking it under the left pointed her
right hand at a wooden weathervane in the shape of a sperm whale
and asked

Please does that fish go round

Go round Go round where

I mean does it go round and round on a stick

Callate it does when it has a chance

And does it make the wind blow notheast by noth andand like
that

Eh Make the wind blowhow

I mean does it make the wind blow different ways notheast by
noth and cantin round to the soueast andand those ways
Captain Hedge has got a fish up on his barn that used to do that
but now it wont cause he callates its rusted fast He said he
guessed he would have to be getting a new one When I saw the
fishes out in your yard I thought about it and I thought I would
come in and see if you had the right kind Is this one aa
gunfish

A WHICH fish

A gunfish No that isnt it Aa swordfish thats it
Captain Hedges is a swordfish

Well that particular one got a wrong start and ended up by bein
a whale but I shouldnt wonder if we could find a swordfish if we
looked Yes heres one Think that would do

The child looked it over very carefully

Yes she said I think it would If youre sure it would make
the wind go right

Well I guess likely I could guarantee that fish would go most
any way the wind did unless it should take a notion to blow
straight up and down which dont happen often So you know Capn
Hedge do you Relation of his are you Visitin there

No Mamma and I are boarding at Mrs Smalleys but I go over to
call on Captain Hedge most every day

Sho Want to know Well thats nice and sociable So youre
boardin at Luretta Smalleys My youre considerble ways from
home aint you Is your mamma with you

For the first time the youthful callers poise seemed a trifle
shaken

Noo    no she stammered and added hastily How much is
this fish please

I generally sell that sort of fish for about two dollars He
looked out of the window hummed a tune and then added Lets
see what did you say your name was

I didnt but its Barbara Armstrong HOW much did you say the
fish was

Eh    Oh two dollars

Miss Armstrong looked very much disappointed

Oh dear she sighed I didnt know it would be as much as
that IIm fraid I cant get it

So Thats too bad What was you callatin to do with it if
you did get it

I was going to give it to Captain Hedge He misses his now that
its rusted so fast that it wont go But I cant get it I
havent got but fourteen cents ten that Mamma gave me this morning
for being a good girl and taking my medicine nice yesterday and
four that Mrs Smalley gave me for getting the eggs last week And
two dollars is EVER so much more than fourteen cents isnt it

Hum    Tis a little more thats right Its considered
more by theumerbest authorities Hum    er    huum
Sometimes though I do take off a little somethin for spot cash
Youd pay spot cash I presume likely wouldnt you

II dont know what spot cash is Id pay fourteen cents

Jed rubbed his chin Weell he drawled gravely Im afraid I
couldnt hardly knock off all that that comes to But taking
another and much smaller vane from a shelf theres an article
not quite so big that I usually get fifty cents for What do you
think of that

The child took the miniature swordfish and inspected it carefully

Its a baby one isnt it she observed Will it tell wind just
as good as the big one

Tell wind Hum    Dont knows I ever heard it put just that
way afore But a clock tells time so I suppose theres no reason
why a vane shouldnt tell wind Yes I guess twill tell wind all
right

Then I think it might do She seemed a little doubtful Only
she added fifty cents is lots more than fourteen isnt it

Mr Winslow admitted that it was But I tell you he said after
another period of reflection seein as its you Ill make a
proposal to you Capn Eri Hedge is a pretty good friend of mine
same as he is of yours Suppose you and I go in partners You put
in your fourteen cents and Ill put in the rest of the swordfish
Then you can take it to Capn Eri and tell him that were givin it
to him together You just consider that plan for a minute now
will you

Miss Armstrong looked doubtful

II dont know as I know what you mean she said What did you
want me to do

Why consider the plan You know what consider means dont
you

I know a Mother Goose with it in That one about the piper and
the cow


 He took up his pipes and he played her a tune
 Consider old cow consider


But I dont know as I SURELY know what he wanted the cow to do
Does consider mean see if you like it

Thats the idea Think it over and see if youd like to go halves
with me givin the fish to Capn Hedge

The curls moved vigorously up and down

I think I should she decided

Good Now you wait and Ill do it up

He wrapped the toy vane in a piece of paper and handed it to his
small patron She gravely produced a miniature velvet purse with
the remnants of some bead fringe hanging to its lower edge and laid
a dime and four pennies on the top of a packing case between them
It was growing dark in the shop and Jed lighted one of the bracket
lamps Returning he found the coins laid in a row and Miss
Armstrong regarding them somewhat soberly

There isnt any MORE than fourteen is there she asked I
meanI mean fourteen cents takes all of it doesnt it

Jed looked at her face His eye twinkled

Well suppose it didnt he asked What then

She hesitated Why she stammered ifif there was ONE left
over Imaybe I could buy something tomorrow at the candy store
Not today cause I told Mamma I wouldnt today cause I was sick
at my stomach yesterdaybut tomorrow I could

Mr Winslow carefully counted the coins and then spreading them
out on his big palm showed them to her

There he said Now youve given me the fourteen cents Ive
got em havent I

Miss Barbara solemnly nodded

Yes continued Jed Now Ill put em back in your wallet again
There they are shut up in the wallet Now you put the wallet in
your pocket Now take your fish bundle under your arm There now
everythings settled Youve got the fish havent you Sartin
Yes and Ive been paid for it havent I

The child stared at him

Butbut she began

Nownow dont lets argue about it pleaded Jed plaintively
Argum always gives me theerepizootic or somethin You saw me
have the money right in my hand Its all settled think it over
and see if it aint Youve got the fish and Ive HAD the fourteen
cents Now run right along home and dont get lost Goodnight

He led her gently to the door and closed it behind her Then
smiling and shaking his head he returned to the inner shop where
he lit the lamps and sat down for another bit of painting before
supper But that bit was destined not to be done that night He
had scarcely picked up his brush before the doorbell rang once
more Returning to the outer room he found his recent visitor
the swordfish under one arm and the doll under the other standing
in the aisle between the stacked mills and vanes and looking so it
seemed to him considerably perturbed

Well well he exclaimed Back again so soon Whats the
matter forget somethin did you

Miss Armstrong shook her head

Noo she said Butbut

Yes But what

Dont you thinkdont you think it is pretty dark for little
girls to be out

Jed looked at her stepped to the door opened it and looked out
and then turned back again

Why he admitted it is gettin a little shadowy in the corners
maybe It will be darker in an hour or so But you think its too
dark for little girls already eh

She nodded I dont think Mamma would like me to be out when its
so awful dark she said

Hum    Hum    Does your mamma know where you are

The young ladys toe marked a circle on the shop floor

Noo she confessed II guess she doesnt not just exactly

I shouldnt be surprised And so youve come back because you was
afraid eh

She swallowed hard and edged a little nearer to him

Noo she declared stoutly II wasnt afraid not very but
but I thought thethe swordfish was pretty heavy to carry all
alone andand so

Jed laughed aloud something that he rarely did

Good for you sis he exclaimed Now you just wait until I get
my hat and well carry that heavy fish home together

Miss Armstrong looked decidedly happier

Thank you very much she said Andand if you please my name
is Barbara


CHAPTER IV


The Smalley residence where Mrs Luretta Smalley relict of the
late Zenas T accommodated a few paying guests was nearly a
mile from the windmill shop and on the Orham lower road Mr
Winslow and his new acquaintance took the short cuts through by
paths and across fields and the young lady appeared to have
thoroughly recovered from her misgivings concerning the darkin
reality it was scarcely duskand her doubts concerning her ability
to carry the heavy swordfish without help At all events she
insisted upon carrying it alone telling her companion that she
thought perhaps he had better not touch it as it was so very very
brittle and might get broken and consoling him by offering to
permit him to carry Petunia which fragrant appellation it
appeared was the name of the doll

I named her Petunia after a flower she explained I think she
looks like a flower dont you

If she did it was a wilted one However Miss Armstrong did not
wait for comment on the part of her escort but chatted straight
on Jed learned that her mothers name was Mrs Ruth Phillips
Armstrong It used to be Mrs Seymour Armstrong but it isnt
now because Papas name was Doctor Seymour Armstrong and he died
you know And they lived in a central Connecticut city but
perhaps they werent going to live there any more because Mamma had
sold the house and didnt know exactly WHAT to do And they had
been in Orham ever since before the Fourth of July and they liked
it EVER so much it was so quaint andand franteek

Jed interrupted here So quaint and what he demanded

Franteek Miss Barbara herself seemed a little doubtful of the
word At any rate Mamma said it was something like that and it
meant they liked it anyway So Mr Winslow was left to ponder
whether antique or unique was intended and to follow his train
of thought wherever it chanced to lead him while the child
prattled on They came in sight of the Smalley front gate and Jed
came out of his walking trance to hear her say

Anyway we like it all but the salratus biscuits and the coffee
and THEY are dreadful Mamma thinks its made of chickenrythe
coffee I mean

At the gate Jeds queerness or shyness came upon him The idea
of meeting Mrs Armstrong or even the members of the Smalley family
he shrank from Barbara invited him to come in but he refused
even to accompany her to the door

Ill just run along now he said hurriedly Good night

The child put out her hand Good night she said Thank you
very much for helping me carry the fish home Im coming to see
you again some day

She scampered up the walk Jed waiting in the shadow of the lilac
bushes by the fence saw her rattle the latch of the door saw the
door open and the child caught up in the arms of a woman who
cried Oh Babbie dear where HAVE you been Mamma was SO
frightened

He smiled over the memory of the little girls visit more than once
that evening He was very fond of children and their society did
not embarrass or annoy him as did the company of most grownups
strangers that is He remembered portions of Miss Barbaras
conversation and determined to repeat them to Captain Sam
Hunniwell the next time the latter called

And that next time was the following forenoon Captain Sam on the
way to his office at the bank stopped his car at the edge of the
sidewalk and came into the shop Jed having finished painting
wooden sailors for the present was boxing an assorted collection
of mills and vanes to be sent South for a certain demand for
Winslow mills was developing at the winter as well as the summer
resorts It was far from winter yet but this purchaser was
forehanded

Hello Jed hailed the captain busy as usual Youve got the
busy bee a mile astern so far as real hustlin is concerned

Jed took a nail from the half dozen held between his lips and
applied its point to the box top His sentences for the next few
minutes were mumbled between nails and punctuated with blows of the
hammer

The busy bee he mumbled can sting other folks He dont get
stung much himself Collectin honeys easier I callate than
collectin money

Captain Sam grunted Are you stung again he demanded Who did
it this time

Jed pointed with the hammer to an envelope lying on a pile of
wooden crows The captain took up the envelope and inspected its
contents


We regret to inform you he read aloud that the Funny Novelty
Company of this town went into bankruptcy a month ago

JOHN HOLWAY


Humph he sniffed Thats short and sweet Owed you somethin
I presume likely

Jed nodded Seventeen dollars and three cents he admitted
between the remaining nails

Sho Well if you could get the seventeen dollars youd throw off
the three cents wouldnt you

Noo

You wouldnt Why not

Jed pried a crookedly driven nail out again and substituted a fresh
one

Cant afford to he drawled Thats the part Ill probably
get

Guess youre right Whos this John Holway

Eh    Why when he ordered the mills of me last summer he was
president of the Funny Novelty Company up there to Manchester

Good Lord Well I admire his nerve How did you come to sell
theseerFunny folks in the first place

Mr Winslow looked surprised

Why they wrote and sent an order he replied

Did eh And you didnt think of lookin em up to see whether
they was good for anything or good for nothin Just sailed in and
hurried off the stuff I presume likely

Jed nodded Whywhy yes of course he said You see they
said they wanted it right away

His friend groaned Gracious king he exclaimed How many
times have I told you to let me look up credits for you when you
get an order from a stranger Well theres no use talkin to you
Give me this letter Ill see what I can squeeze out of your Funny
friend    But say he added I cant stop but a minute and
I ran in to ask you if youd changed your mind about rentin the
old house here If you have I believe Ive got a good tenant for
you

Jed looked troubled He laid down the hammer and took the last
nail from his mouth

Nownow Sam he began you know

Oh I know youve set your thick head dead against rentin it at
all but thats silly as Ive told you a thousand times The
house is empty and it doesnt do any house good to stay empty
Course if twas anybody but you Jed Winslow youd live in it
yourself instead of campin out in this shack here

Jed sat down on the box he had just nailed and taking one long leg
between his big hands pulled its knee up until he could have
rested his chin upon it without much inconvenience

I know Sam he drawled gravely but thats the troubleI aint
been anybody but me for fortyfive years

The captain smiled in spite of his impatience And you wont be
anybody else for the next fortyfive he said I know that But
all the same bein a practical more or less sane man myself it
makes me nervous to see a nice attractive comfortable little
house standin idle while the feller that owns it eats and sleeps
in a twobyfour sawmill so to speak And not only that but
wont let anybody else live in the house either I call that a
dog in the manger business and crazy besides

The big foot at the end of the long leg swung slowly back and
forth Mr Winslow looked absently at the roof

DONT look like that snapped Captain Sam Come out of it
Wake up It always gives me the fidgets to see you settin gapin
at nothin What are you daydreamin about now eh

Jed turned and gazed over his spectacles

I was thinkin he observed that most likely that dog himself
was crazy If he wasnt he wouldnt have got into the manger I
never saw a dog that wanted to climb into a manger did you Sam

Oh confound the manger and the dog too Look here Jed if I
found you a good tenant would you rent em that house of yours

Jed looked more troubled than ever

Sam he began you know Id do most anything to oblige you
but

Oblige me This aint to oblige me Its to oblige you

Oh then I wont do it

Well then tis to oblige me Itll oblige me to have you show
some sense Come on Jed These people Ive got in mind are nice
people They want to find a little house and theyve come to me at
the bank for advice about findin it Its a chance for you a
real chance

Jed rocked back and forth He looked genuinely worried

Who are they he asked after a moment

Cant name any names yet

Another period of reflection Then City folks or Orham folks
inquired Mr Winslow

City folks

Some of the worried look disappeared Jed was plainly relieved and
more hopeful

Oh then they wont want it he declared City folks want to
hire houses in the spring not along as late in the summer as
this

These people do Theyre thinkin of livin here in Orham all the
year round Its a firstrate chance for you Jed Course I know
you dont really need the money perhaps butwell to be real
honest I want these folks to stay in Orhamtheyre the kind of
folks the town needsand I want em contented I think they would
be contented in your house You let those Davidsons from Chicago
have the place that summer but youve never let anybody so much as
consider it since Whats the real reason Youve told me as much
as a dozen but Ill bet anything youve never told me the real
one Twas somethin the Davidsons did you didnt likebut what

Jeds rocking back and forth on the box became almost energetic and
his troubled expression more than ever apparent

Nownow Sam he begged Ive told you all about that ever and
ever so many times There wasnt anything really

There was too What was it

Jed suffered in silence for two or three minutes

What was the real reason Out with it persisted Captain
Hunniwell

Wellwell twastwas desperately twas the squeakin and
and squealin

Squeakin and squealin Gracious king What are you talkin
about

Whythethe mills you know The mills and vanes outside onon
the posts and the fence They squeaked andand sometimes they
squealed awful And he didnt like it

Who didnt

Colonel Davidson He said theyd got to stop makin that noise
and I said Id oil em every day Andand I forgot it

Yeswell I aint surprised to death exactly What then

Wellwell you see they were squealin worse than usual one
mornin and Colonel Davidson he came in here andand I remembered
I hadnt oiled em for three days And II said how horrible the
squealin was and that Id oil em right away andand

Well go on go on

And when I went out to do it there wasnt any wind and the mills
wasnt goin at all You see twas his oldest daughter takin her
singin lessons in the house with the window open

Captain Sam put back his head and shouted Jed looked sadly at the
floor When the captain could speak he asked

And you mean to tell me that was the reason you wouldnt let the
house again

Erwhy yes

I know better You didnt have any row with the Davidsons You
couldnt row with anybody anyhow and besides the Colonel himself
told me they would have taken the house the very next summer but
you wouldnt rent it to em And you mean to say that yarn youve
just spun was the reason

Whyyes

Rubbish Youve told me a dozen reasons afore but Im bound to
say this is the most foolish yet All right keep the real reason
to yourself then But I tell you what Im goin to do to get even
with you Im goin to send these folks down to look at your house
and I shant tell you who they are or when theyre comin

The knee slipped down from Mr Winslows grasp and his foot struck
the floor with a crash He made a frantic clutch at his friends
arm

Oh now Sam he cried in horror dont do that Dont talk
so You dont mean it Come here    Sam

But the captain was at the door You bet I mean it he declared
Keep your weather eye peeled Jed Theyll be comin most any
time now And if you have ANY sense youll let em the house So
long

He drove away in his little car Jed Winslow left standing in the
shop doorway staring after him groaned in anxious foreboding

He groaned a good many times during the next few hours Each time
the bell rang announcing the arrival of a visitor he rose to answer
it perfectly sure that here were the wouldbe tenants whom his
friend in the mistaken kindness of his heart was sending to him
Not that he had the slightest idea of renting his old home but he
dreaded the ordeal of refusing In fact he was not sure that he
could refuse not sure that he could invent a believable excuse for
doing so Another person would not have sought excuses would have
declared simply that the property was not for rent but Jed Winslow
was not that other person he was himself and ordinary methods of
procedure were not his

Two or three groups of customers came in purchased and departed
Captain Jerry Burgess dropped in to bring the Winslow mail which
in this case consisted of an order a bill and a circular setting
forth the transcendent healing qualities of African Balm the Foe
of Rheumatism Mr Bearse happened in to discuss the great news of
the proposed aviation camp and to tell with gusto and detail how
Phineas Babbitt had met Captain Hunniwell right square in front of
the bank and had not spoken to him No sir never said a word
to him no moren if he want there What do you think of that
And they say Leander wrote his dad that he thought he was goin to
like soldierin fustrate and Mrs Sarah Mary Babbitt she told
Melissa Busteed that her husbands language when he read that was
somethin sinful She said she never was more thankful that they
had lightnin rods on the roof cause such talk as that was enough
to fetch down fire from heaven


CHAPTER V


It was nearly noon when Jed entering the front shop in answer to
the bell found there the couple the sight of which caused his
heart to sink Here they were the house huntersthere was no
doubt of it in his mind The man was short and broad and
protuberant and pompous The woman possessed all the last three
qualities besides being tall He shone with prosperity and
sunburn she reeked of riches and talcum They were just the sort
of people who would insist upon hiring a house that was not in the
market its not being in the market would in their eyes make it
all the more desirable

Jed had seen them before knew they were staying at the hotel and
that their names were Powless He remembered now with a thrill of
alarm that Mr Bearse had recently spoken of them as liking Orham
very much and considering getting a place of their own And of
course Captain Sam hearing this had told them of the Winslow
place had sent them to him Oh Lord Oh Lord thought Jed
although what he said was Good mornin

He might as well have said nothing Mrs Powless looming large
between the piles of mills and vanes like a battleship in a narrow
channel was loftily inspecting the stock through her lorgnette
Her husband his walking stick under his arm and his hands in his
pockets was not even making the pretense of being interested he
was staring through the seaward window toward the yard and the old
house

These are really quite extraordinary the lady announced after a
moment George you really should see these extraordinary
things

George was evidently not interested He continued to look out of
the window

What are they he asked without turning

Oh I dont know All sorts of queer dolls and boatsand
creatures made of wood Like those outside you knower
teetotums windmills Do come and look at them

Mr Powless did not comply He said Umph and that was all

George repeated Mrs Powless do you hear me Come and look at
them

And George came One might have inferred that when his wife spoke
like that he usually came He treated a wooden porpoise to a
thoroughly wooden stare and repeated his remark of Umph

Arent they extraordinary exclaimed his wife Does this man
make them himself I wonder

She seemed to be addressing her husband so Jed did not answer

Do you demanded Mr Powless

Yes replied Jed

Mrs Powless said Fancy Mr Powless strolled back to the
window

This view is all right Mollie he observed Better even than
it is from the street Come and see

Mrs Powless went and saw Jed stood still and stared miserably

Rather attractive on the whole dont you think dear inquired
the gentleman Must be very decent in the yard there

The lady did not reply but she opened the door and went out
around the corner of the shop and into the back yard Her husband
trotted after her The owner of the property gazing pathetically
through the window saw them wandering about the premises looking
off at the view up into the trees and finally trying the door of
the old house and peeping in between the slats of the closed
blinds Then they came strolling back to the shop Jed drawing a
long breath prepared to face the ordeal

Mrs Powless entered the shop Mr Powless remained by the door
He spoke first

You own all this he asked indicating the surrounding country
with a wave of his cane Jed nodded

That house too waving the point of the cane toward the Winslow
cottage

Yes

How old is it

Jed stammered that he guessed likely it was about a hundred years
old or such matter

Umph Furniture old too

Yes I callate most of it is

Nobody living in it

Noo

Got the key to it

Here was the question direct If he answered in the affirmative
the next utterance of the Powless man would be a command to be
shown the interior of the house Jed was certain of it he could
see it in the mans eye What was infinitely more important he
could see it in the ladys eye He hesitated

Got the key to it repeated Mr Powless

Jed swallowed

Noo he faltered II guess not

You GUESS not Dont you know whether youve got it or not

No I mean yes I know I aint

Where is it lost

The key was usually lost that is to say Jed was accustomed to
hunt for fifteen minutes before finding it so his conscience
backing his inclination he replied that he callated it must be

Umph grunted Powless How do you get into the house without a
key

Jed rubbed his chin swallowed hard and drawled that he didnt
very often

You do sometimes dont you

The best answer that the harassed windmill maker could summon was
that he didnt know The redfaced gentleman stared at him in
indignant amazement

You dont KNOW he repeated Which dont you know whether you
go into the house at all or how you get in without a key

Yesererthats it

Mr Powless breathed deeply Well Ill be damned he declared
with conviction

His wife did not contradict his assertion but she made one of her
own

George she commanded majestically cant you see the man has
been drinking Probably he doesnt own the place at all Dont
waste another moment on him We will come back later when the
real owner is in Come

George came and they both went Mr Winslow wiped his perspiring
forehead on a piece of wrapping paper and sat down upon a box to
recover Recovery however was by no means rapid or complete
They had gone but they were coming back again and what should he
say to them then Very likely Captain Sam who had sent them in
the first place would return with them And Captain Sam knew that
the key was not really lost Jeds satisfaction in the fact that
he had escaped tenantless so far was nullified by the fear that his
freedom was but temporary

He cooked his dinner but ate little After washing the dishes he
crossed the road to the telephone and telegraph office and called
up the Orham Bank He meant to get Captain Hunniwell on the wire
tell him that the house hunters had paid him a visit that he did
not like them and beg the captain to call them off the scent But
Captain Sam had motored to Ostable to attend a preliminary session
of the Exemption Board Jed sauntered gloomily back to the shop
When he opened the door and entered he was greeted by a familiar
voice which said

Here he is Mamma Good afternoon Mr Winslow

Jed started turned and found Miss Barbara Armstrong beaming up at
him The young ladys attire and general appearance were in marked
contrast to those of the previous evening Petunia also was in
calling costume save for the trifling lack of one eye and a chip
from the end of her nose she would have been an ornament to doll
society anywhere

This is my mamma announced Barbara Shes come to see you

How do you do Mr Winslow said Mrs Armstrong

Jed looked up to find her standing beside him her hand extended
Beside a general impression that she was young and that her gown
and hat and shoes were white he was at that moment too greatly
embarrassed to notice much concerning her appearance Probably he
did not notice even this until later However he took her hand
moved it up and down dropped it again and said IIm pleased to
meet you maam

She smiled And I am very glad to meet you she said It was
very kind of you to bring my little girl home last night and she
and I have come to thank you for doing it

Jed was more embarrassed than ever

Sho sho he protested twasnt anything

Oh yes it was it was a great deal I was getting very worried
almost frightened She had been gone ever since luncheondinner
I meanand I had no idea where Shes a pretty good little girl
generally speaking drawing the child close and smiling down upon
her but sometimes she is heedless and forgets Yesterday she
forgot didnt you dear

Barbara shook her head

I didnt forget she said I mean I only forgot a little
Petunia forgot almost EVERYTHING I forgot and went as far as the
bridge but she forgot all the way to the clam field

Jed rubbed his chin

The which field he drawled

The clam field The place where Mrs Smalleys fish man unplants
the clams she makes the chowder of He does it with a sort of hoe
thing and puts them in a pail He was doing it yesterday I saw
him

Jeds eyes twinkled at the word unplants but another thought
occurred to him

You wasnt out on those clam flats alone was you he asked
addressing Barbara

She nodded Petunia and I went all alone she said It was
kind of wet so we took off our shoes and stockings and paddled
II dont knows I remembered to tell you that part Mamma she
added hastily II guess it must have slipped my mind

But Mrs Armstrong was watching Jeds face

Was there any danger she asked quickly

Jed hesitated before answering Why he drawled II dont
know as there was butwell the tide comes in kind of slow off ON
the flats but its liable to fill up the channels between them and
the beach some faster Course if you know the wadin places its
all right but if you dont itswell its sort of uncomfortable
thats all

The ladys cheeks paled a bit but she did not exclaim nor as Jed
would have said make a fuss She said simply Thank you I
will remember and that was the only reference she made to the
subject of the clam field

Miss Barbara to whom the events of dead yesterdays were of no
particular concern compared to those of the vital and living to
day was rummaging among the stock

Mamma she cried excitedly here is a whale fish like the one I
was going to buy for Captain Hedge Come and see it

Mrs Armstrong came and was much interested She asked Jed
questions concerning the whale fish and others of his creations
At first his replies were brief and monosyllabic but gradually
they became more lengthy until without being aware of it he was
carrying on his share of a real conversation Of course he
hesitated and paused and drawled but he always did that even when
talking with Captain Sam Hunniwell

He took down and exhibited his wares one by one Barbara asked
numberless questions concerning each and chattered like a red
squirrel Her mother showed such a genuine interest in his work
and was so pleasant and quiet and friendly was in short such a
marked contrast to Mrs George Powless that he found himself
actually beginning to enjoy the visit Usually he was glad when
summer folks finished their looking and buying and went away but
now when Mrs Armstrong glanced at the clock on the shelf he was
secretly glad that that clock had not gone for over four months and
had providentially stopped going at a quarter after three

He took them into the inner shop his workroom and showed them the
band saw and the lathe and the rest of his manufacturing outfit
Barbara asked if he lived there all alone and he said he did

I live out there he explained pointing toward the shop
extension Got a sittinroom and a kitchen out there and a
little upstairs where I sleep

Mrs Armstrong seemed surprised Why she exclaimed I thought
you lived in that dear little old house next door here I was told
that you owned it

Jed nodded Yes maam he said I do own it but I dont live
in it I used to live there but I aint for quite a spell now

I dont see how you could bear to give it up It looks so quaint
and homey and if the inside is as delightful as the outside it
must be quite wonderful And the view is the best in town isnt
it

Jed was pleased Why yes maam tis pretty good he admitted
Anyhow most folks seem to callate tis Wouldnt you like to
come out and look at it

Barbara clapped her hands Oh yes Mamma do she cried

Her mother hesitated I dont know that we ought to trouble Mr
Winslow she said He is busy you know

Jed protested It wont be a mite of trouble he declared
Besides it aint healthy to work too long at a stretch That
is he drawled folks say taint so I never take the risk

Mrs Armstrong smiled and followed him out into the yard where
Miss Barbara had already preceded them The view over the edge of
the bluff was glorious and the grass in the yard was green the
flowers bright and pretty and the shadows of the tall lilac bushes
by the back door of the little white house cool and inviting

Barbara danced along the bluff edge looking down at the dories and
nets on the beach below Her mother sighed softly

It is lovely she said Then turning to look at the little
house she added And it was your old home I suppose

Jed nodded Yes maam he replied I was born in that house
and lived there all my life up to five years ago

And then you gave it up Why    Please forgive me I didnt
mean to be curious

Oh thats all right maam Nothin secret about it My mother
died and I didnt seem to care about livin there alone thats
all

I see I understand

She looked as if she did understand and Jed the seldom
understood experienced an unusual pleasure The sensation
produced an unusual result

Its a kind of cute and oldfashioned house inside he observed
Maybe youd like to go in and look around would you

She looked very much pleased Oh I should indeed she
exclaimed May I

Now the moment after he issued the invitation he was sorry It
had been quite unpremeditated and had been given he could not have
told why His visitor had seemed so genuinely interested and
above all had treated him like a rational human being instead of a
freak Under this unaccustomed treatment Jed Winslow had been
caught off his guardhypnotized so to speak And now when it
was too late he realized the possible danger Only a few hours
ago he had told Mr and Mrs George Powless that the key to that
house had been lost

He paused and hesitated Mrs Armstrong noticed his hesitation

Please dont think any more about it she said It is
delightful here in the yard Babbie and I will stay here a few
minutes if we may and you must go back to your work Mr
Winslow

But Jed having put his foot in it was ashamed to withdraw He
hastened to disclaim any intention of withdrawal

No no he protested I dont need to go to work not yet
anyhow I should be real pleased to show you the house maam
You wait now and Ill fetch the key

Some five minutes later he reappeared with triumph in his eye and
the lost key in his hand

Sorry to keep you waitin maam he explained The key had
erstole its nest as you might say Got it now though

His visitors looked at the key which was attached by a cord to a
slab of wood about the size of half a shingle Upon one side of
the slab were lettered in black paint the words HERE IT IS
Barbaras curiosity was aroused

What have you got those letters on there for Mr Winslow she
asked What does it say

Jed solemnly read the inscription I printed that on there he
explained so Id be able to find the key when I wanted it

Mrs Armstrong smiled I should think it might help she
observed evidently much amused

Mr Winslow nodded You would think so he said wouldnt you
Maybe twould too only twas such a plaguey nuisance towin that
half a cord of wood around that I left it to home last time
Untied the string you know and just took the key The wood and
the string was hangin up in the right place but the key want
among those present as they say in the newspapers

Where was it demanded Barbara

Hush dear cautioned her mother You mustnt ask so many
questions

Thats all right maam I dont mind a mite Where was it
Well twas in my pants pocket here just where I put it last
time I used it Naturally enough I shouldnt have thought of
lookin there and I dont knows Id have found it yet but I
happened to shove my hands in my pockets to help me think and
there twas

This explanation should have been satisfying doubtless but
Barbara did not seem to find it wholly so

Please may I ask one more question Mamma she pleaded Just
only one

She asked it before her mother could reply

How does putting your hands in your pockets help you think Mr
Winslow she asked I dont see how it would help a bit

Jeds eye twinkled but his reply was solemnly given

Why you see he drawled Im built a good deal like the old
steam launch Tobias Wixon used to own Every time Tobias blew the
whistle it used up all the steam and the engine stopped Ive got
a head about like that engine when I want to use it I have to give
all the rest of me a layoff    Here we are maam Walk right
in wont you

He showed them through room after room of the little house opening
the closed shutters so that the afternoon sunlight might stream in
and brighten their progress The rooms were small but they were
attractive and cosy The furniture was almost all old mahogany and
in remarkably good condition The rugs were homemade even the
coverlets of the beds were of the oldfashioned blue and white
woven on the hand looms of our greatgrandmothers Mrs Armstrong
was enthusiastic

It is like a miniature museum of antiques she declared And
such wonderful antiques too You must have been besieged by
people who wanted to buy them

Jed nodded Yees he admitted I callate theres been no
lessn a million antiquers here in the last four or five year I
dont mean here in the houseI never let em in the housebut
round the premises Got so they kind of swarmed first of every
summer like June bugs I got rid of em though for a spell

Did you how

He rubbed his chin Put up a sign by the front door that said
Beware of Leprosy That kept em away while it lasted

Mrs Armstrong laughed merrily I should think so she said
But why leprosy pray

Oh I was goin to make it smallpox but I asked Doctor Parker if
there was anything worse than smallpox and he said he callated
leprosy was about as bad as any disease goin It worked fine
while it lasted but the Board of Health made me take it down said
there want any leprosy on the premises I told em no but twas
a good idea to beware of it anyhow and Id put up the sign just on
general principles No use they hadnt much use for principles
general or otherwise seemed so

The lady commented on the neatness and order in the little rooms
They were in marked contrast to the workshop I suppose you have
a woman come here to clean and sweep she said

Jed shook his head

Noo he answered I generally callate to come in every little
while and clean up Mother was always a great one for keepin
things slicked up he added apologetically and II kind of
like to think twould please her Foolish I presume likely but
well foolish things seem to come natural to me Got a kind of a
gift for em as you might say I   

He lapsed into silence his sentence only begun Mrs Armstrong
looking up found him gazing at her with the absent faroff look
that his closest associates knew so well She had not met it
before and found it rather embarrassing especially as it kept on
and on

Well she asked after a time He started and awoke to
realities

I was just thinkin he explained that you was the only woman
that has been in this house since the summer I let it to the
Davidson folks And Mrs Davidson want a mite like you

That was true enough Mrs Davidson had been a plump elderly
matron with gray hair a rather rasping voice and a somewhat
aggressive manner Mrs Armstrong was young and slim her hair and
eyes were dark her manner refined and her voice low and gentle
And if Jed had been in the habit of noticing such things he might
have noticed that she was pleasant to look at Perhaps he was
conscious of this fact but if so it was only in a vague general
way

His gaze wandered to Barbara who with Petunia was curled up in a
big oldfashioned rocker

And a child too he mused I dont know when theres been a
child in here Not since I was one I guess likely and thats too
long ago for anybody to remember singlehanded

But Mrs Armstrong was interested in his previous remark

You have let others occupy this house then she asked

Yes maam one summer I did Let it furnished to some folks name
of Davidson from Chicago

And you havent rented it since

No maam not but that once

She was silent for a moment Then she said I am surprised that
it hasnt been occupied always Do you ask such a VERY high rent
Mr Winslow

Jed looked doubtful Why no maam he answered I didnt
callate twas so very high considerin that twas just for
summer and furnished and all The Davidsons paid forty dollars a
month but

FORTY dollars A month And furnished like that You mean a
week dont you

Mr Winslow looked at her The slow smile wandered across his
face He evidently suspected a joke

Why no maam he drawled You see they was rentin the
place not buyin it

But forty dollars a month is VERY cheap

Is it Sho Now you speak of it I remember that Captain Sam
seemed to callate twas He said I ought to have asked a hundred
or some such foolishness I told him he must have the notion that
I was left out of the sweet ile when they pickled the other thirty
nine thieves Perhaps youve read the story maam he suggested

His visitor laughed I have read it she said Then she added
plainly more to herself than to him But even forty is far too
much of course

Jed was surprised and a little hurt

Yeseryes maam he faltered Well II was kind of fraid
twas but Colonel Davidson seemed to think twas about fair so

Oh you misunderstand me I didnt mean that forty dollars was
too high a rent It isnt it is a very low one I meant that it
was more than I ought to think of paying You see Mr Winslow I
have been thinking that we might live here in Orham Barbara and I
I like the town and the people most of those I have met have
been very pleasant and kind And it is necessarythat is it
seems to me preferablethat we live for some years at least away
from the city This little house of yours is perfect I fell in
love with the outside of it at first sight Now I find the inside
even more delightful Ishe hesitated and then addedI dont
suppose you would care to let it unfurnished atat a lower rate

Jed was very much embarrassed The idea that his caller would make
such a proposition as this had not occurred to him for a moment
If it had the lost key would almost certainly have remained lost
He liked Mrs Armstrong even on such short acquaintance and he had
taken a real fancy to Barbara but his prejudice against tenants
remained He rubbed his chin

Whywhy now maam he stammered youyou wouldnt like
livin in Orham all the year round would you

I hope I should I know I should like it better than living
elsewhere with so it seemed to him a little shudder And I
cannot afford to live otherwise than very simply anywhere I have
been boarding in Orham for almost three months now and I feel that
I have given it a trial

Yesyes maam but summers considerable more lively than winter
here on the Cape

I have no desire for society I expect to be quiet and I wish to
be Mr Winslow would you consider letting me occupy this house
unfurnished of course I should dearly love to take it just as it
isthis furniture is far more fitting for it than minebut I
cannot afford forty dollars a month Provided you were willing to
let me hire the house of you at all not for the summer alone but
for all the year what rent do you think you should charge

Jeds embarrassment increased Well now maam he faltered
II hope you wont mind my sayin it butbut I dont knows I
want to let this house at all IIve had considerble many
chances to rent it butbut

He could not seem to find a satisfactory ending to the sentence and
so left it unfinished Mrs Armstrong was evidently much
disappointed but she did not give up completely

I see she said Well in a way I think I understand You
prefer the privacy I think I could promise you that Barbara and I
would disturb you very little As to the rent that would be paid
promptly

Sartin maam sartin I know twould but

Wont you think it over We might even live here for a month
with your furniture undisturbed and at the regular rental You
could call it a trial month if you liked You could see how you
liked us you know At the end of that time with a smile you
might tell us we wouldnt do at all or perhaps then you might
consider making a more permanent arrangement Barbara would like
it here wouldnt you dear

Barbara who had been listening nodded excitedly from the big
rocker Ever and ever so much she declared and Petunia would
just adore it

Poor Jed was greatly perturbed Dont talk so Mrs Armstrong
he blurted Please dont II dont want you to Youyou make
me feel bad

Do I Im so sorry I didnt mean to say anything to hurt your
feelings I beg your pardon

No you dont II mean you hadnt ought to You dont hurt my
feelins I mean you make me feel badwickedcussed meanall
that and some more I know I ought to let you have this house
Any common decent man with common decent feelins and sense would
let you have it But you see I aint that kind IIm selfish
andand wicked and He waved a big hand in desperation

She laughed Nonsense she exclaimed Besides it isnt so
desperate as all that You certainly are not obliged to rent the
house unless you want to

But I do want to that is I dont but I know Id ought to want
to And if I was goin to let anybody have it Id rather twould
be youhonest I would And its the right thing for me to do I
know that Thats what bothers me the troubles with ME I dont
want to do the right thing He broke off seemed to reflect and
then asked suddenly

Maam do you want to go to heaven when you die

The lady was naturally somewhat surprised at the question Why
yes she replied I Why of course I do

There thats it Any decent sensible person would But I dont

Barbara startled into forgetting that children should be seen and
not heard uttered a shocked Oh

Jed waved his hand You see he said even that childs morals
are upset by me I know I ought to want to go to heaven But when
I see the crowd that KNOW theyre goin there are sartin of it
the ones from this town a good many of em anyhow when I hear how
they talk in prayermeetin and then see how they act outside of
it I Well with a deep sigh I want to go where they aint
thats all He paused and then drawled solemnly but with a
suspicion of the twinkle in his eye The general opinion seems to
be that thats where Ill go sos I dont knows I need to worry

Mrs Armstrong made no comment on this confession He did not seem
to expect any

Maam he continued you see what I mean The troubles with
me I aint made right I ought to let that house Sam Hunniwell
told me so this mornin But II dont want to Nothin personal
to you you understand but    Eh Whos that

A step sounded on the walk outside and voices were heard Jed
turned to the door

Customers I callate he said Make yourselves right to home
maam you and the little girl Ill be right back

He went out through the diningroom into the little hall Barbara
in the big rocker looked up over Petunias head at her mother

Isnt he a funny man Mamma she said

Mrs Armstrong nodded Yes he certainly is she admitted

Yes the child nodded reflectively But I dont believe hes
wicked at all I believe hes real nice dont you

Im sure he is dear

Yes Petunia and I like him I think hes what you said our
Bridget was a rough damson

Not damson diamond dear

Oh yes It was damson preserve Mrs Smalley had for supper last
night I forgot Petunia told me to say damson she makes so many
mistakes

They heard the rough diamond returning He seemed to be in a
hurry When he reentered the little sittingroom he looked very
much frightened

What is the matter demanded Mrs Armstrong

Jed gulped

Theyve come back he whispered Godfreys I forgot em and
theyve come back WHATLL I do now

But whowho has come back

Mr Winslow waved both hands

The Old Scratch and his wife he declared I hope they didnt
see me butLand of love theyre comin in

A majestic tread sounded in the hall in the diningroom Mrs
George Powless appeared severe overwhelming with Mr George
Powless in her wake The former saw Mr Winslow and fixed him with
her glittering eye as the Ancient Mariner fixed the wedding guest

Ah she observed with majestic irony the lost key is found it
would seem

Jed looked guilty

Yes maam he faltered Eryes maam

So And now I presume as it is apparent that you do show the
interior of this house to other interested persons with a glance
like a sharpened icicle in the direction of the Armstrongs
perhaps you will show it to my husband and me

Jed swallowed hard

Well maam he faltered IId like to butbut the fact is
I

Well what

It aint my house

Isnt your house George turning to Mr Powless didnt I hear
this man distinctly tell you that this house WAS his

George nodded Certainly my dear he declared Then turning to
Mr Winslow he demanded What do you mean by saying it is yours
one moment and not yours the next eh

Jed looked around For one instant his gaze rested upon the face
of Mrs Armstrong Then he drew himself up

Because he declared Ive rented it furnished to this lady
here And that bein the case it aint mine just now and I aint
got any right to be in it And his voice rising in desperation
neither has anybody else

Mrs George Powless went a few moments later before she went she
expressed her opinion of Mr Winslows behavior Mr George
Powless followed her expressing his opinion as he went The
object of their adjuration sat down upon a rushbottomed chair and
rubbed his chin

Lord he exclaimed with fervor Mrs Armstrong looked at him in
amazement

Why Mr Winslow she exclaimed and burst out laughing

Jed groaned I know how Jonah felt after the whale unloaded him
he drawled That woman all but had me swallered If you hadnt
been here she would

Jed shouted a voice outside Jed where are you

Mr Winslow raised his head Eh he queried Thats Sam
hollerin aint it

It was Captain Hunniwell and a moment later he entered the little
sittingroom When he saw who his friends companions were he
seemed greatly surprised

Why Mrs Armstrong he exclaimed Are you here Now thats a
funny thing The last time I saw Jed I warned him I was goin to
send you here to look at this house And you came without bein
sent after all eh

Jed stared at him Before the lady could reply he spoke What
he cried Was sheSam Hunniwell was it HER you was goin to
send to see about hirin this house

Sure it was Why not

Jed pointed toward the door Thenthen who he demanded sent
those Powlesses here

No one that I know of And anyhow they dont want to rent any
houses Theyve bought land over at Harnissport and theyre goin
to build a house of their own there

They are They are Thenthen WHAT did that woman say Id got
to show her the inside of this house for

I dont know Did she Oh I tell you what she was after
probably Some one had told her about your old furniture and
things Jed Shes the greatest antique hunter on earth so they
tell me Thats what she was afterantiques

Jed having paused until this had sunk in groaned

Lord he said again And I went and

Another groan finished the sentence

Mrs Armstrong came forward

Please dont worry about it Mr Winslow she said I know you
didnt mean it Of course knowing your feelings I shouldnt
think of taking the house

But Jed slowly shook his head

I want you to he declared Yes I mean it I want you to come
and live in this house for a month anyhow If you dont that
Powless woman will come back and buy every stick and rag on the
place I dont want to sell em but I couldnt say no to her any
more than I could to the Old Harry I called her the Old Scratchs
wife didnt I he added Well I wont take it back

Captain Sam laughed uproariously

You aint very complimentary to Mr Powless he observed

Jed rubbed his chin

I would be if I was referrin to him he drawled but I judge
hes her second husband


CHAPTER VI


Of course Mrs Armstrong still insisted that knowing as she did
Mr Winslows prejudice against occupying the position of landlord
she could not think of accepting his offer Of course I shall
not she declared I am flattered to know that you consider
Barbara and me preferable to Mr and Mrs Powless but even there
you may be mistaken and beside why should you feel you must
endure the lesser evil If I were in your place I shouldnt endure
any evil at all I should keep the house closed and empty just as
you have been doing

Captain Sam shook his head impatiently If you was in his place
he observed you would have let it every year Dont interfere
with him Mrs Armstrong for the land sakes Hes showed the
first streak of common sense about that house that hes showed
since the Davidsons went out Dont ask him to take it back

And Jed stubbornly refused to take it back Ive let it to you
for a month maam he insisted Its yours furniture and all
for a month You wont sell that Mrs Powless any of it will
you he added anxiously Any of the furniture I mean

Mrs Armstrong scarcely knew whether to be amused or indignant

Of course I shouldnt sell it she declared It wouldnt be
mine to sell

Jed looked frightened Yes twould yes twould he persisted
Thats why Im lettin it to you Then I cant sell it to her I
CANT dont you see

Captain Sam grinned Furs that goes he suggested I dont
sees youve got to worry Jed You dont need to sell it to her
or anybody else unless you want to

But Jed looked dubious I suppose Jonah callated he didnt need
to be swallowed he mused You take it maam for a month as a
favor to me

But how can Ilike this We havent even settled the question of
rent And you know nothing whatever about me

He seemed to reflect Then he asked

Your daughter dont sing like a windmill does she

Barbaras eyes and mouth opened Why Mamma she exclaimed
indignantly

Hush Babbie Sing like awhat I dont understand Mr
Winslow

The captain burst out laughing No wonder you dont maam he
said It takes the seven wise men of Greece to understand him
most of the time You leave it to me Mrs Armstrong He and I
will talk it over together and then you and he can talk tomorrow
But I guess likely youll have the house if you want it Jed
doesnt go back on his word I always say that for you dont I
old sawdust turning to the gentleman thus nicknamed

Jed humming a mournful hymn was apparently miles away in
dreamland Yet he returned to earth long enough to indulge in a
mild bit of repartee You say most everything for me Sam he
drawled except when I talk in my sleep

Mrs Armstrong and Barbara left a moment later the lady saying
that she and Mr Winslow would have another interview next day
Barbara gravely shook hands with both men

I and Petunia hope awfully that we are going to live here Mr
Winslow she said specially Petunia

Jed regarded her gravely Oh she wants to moren you do then
does she he asked

The child looked doubtful Noo she admitted after a moments
reflection but she cant talk you know and so she has to hope
twice as hard else I wouldnt know it Goodby Oh I forgot
Captain Hedge liked his swordfish EVER so much He said it was a
aoh yes humdinger

She trotted off after her mother Captain Hunniwell after a
chuckle of appreciation over the humdinger began to tell his
friend what little he had learned concerning the Armstrongs This
was of course merely what Mrs Armstrong herself had told him and
amounted to this She was a widow whose husband had been a
physician in Middleford Connecticut His name was Seymour
Armstrong and he had now been dead four years Mrs Armstrong and
Barbara the latter an only child had continued to occupy the
house at Middleford but recently the lady had come to feel that
she could not afford to live there longer but must find some less
expensive quarters

She didnt say so volunteered Captain Sam but I judge she lost
a good deal of her money bad investments or somethin like that
If theres any bad investment anywheres in the neighborhood you can
most generally trust a widow to hunt it up and put her insurance
money into it Anyhow twas somethin like that for after livin
there a spell just as she did when her husband was alive she all
at once decides to up anchor and find some cheaper moorins First
off though she decided to spend the summer in a cool place and
some friend somebody with good sound judgment suggests Orham
So she lets her own place in Middleford comes to Orham falls in
love with the placesame as any sensible person would naturally
of courseand havin spent most three months here decides she
wants to spend nine more anyhow She comes to the bank to cash a
check she and I get talkin she tells me what shes lookin for
I tell her I callate Ive got a place in my eye that I think might
be just the thing and

He paused to bite the end from a cigar His friend finished the
sentence for him

And then he said you knowin that I didnt want to let this
house any time to anybody naturally sent her down to look at it

No such thing Course I knew that youd OUGHT to let the house
and likin the looks and ways of these Armstrong folks first rate
I give in that I had made up my mind TO send her down to look at
it But afore I could do it the Almighty sent her on His own
hook Which proves he added with a grin that my judgment has
pretty good backin sometimes

Jed rubbed his chin Careful Sam he drawled careful The
Kaiserll be gettin jealous of you if you dont look out But
what he inquired made her and the little girl move out of
Middleford or wherever twas they lived They could have found
cheaper quarters there couldnt they Course I aint never been
there but seems as if they could

Sartin they could but the fact of their movin is what makes me
pretty sure the widows investments had turned sour Its a
plaguey sight easier to begin to cut down and live economical in a
place where nobody knows you than tis in one where everybody has
known you for years See that dont you

Jed whistled sadly breaking off in the middle of a bar to reply
that he didnt know as he did

Ive never cut up so cuttin down dont worry me much he
observed But I presume likely youre right Sam you generally
are He whistled a moment longer his gaze apparently fixed upon
a point in the middle of the white plastered ceiling Then he
said dreamily Well anyhow twont be but a month Theyll go
somewheres else in a month

Captain Sam sniffed Bet you a dollar they wont he retorted
Not unless you turn em out And I see you turnin anybody out

But Mr Winslow looked hopeful Theyll go when the months up
he reiterated Nobody could stand me more than a month Mother
used to say so and shed known me longer than anybody

And so in this curious fashion did tenants come to the old
Winslow house They moved in on the following Monday Jed saw the
wagon with the trunks backing up to the door and he sighed Then
he went over to help carry the trunks into the house

For the first week he found the situation rather uncomfortable not
as uncomfortable as he had feared but a trifle embarrassing
nevertheless His new neighbors were not too neighborly they did
not do what he would have termed pester him by running in and out
of the shop at all hours nor did they continually ask favors On
the other hand they did not like his former tenants the
Davidsons treat him as if he were some sort of odd wooden image
like one of his own weather vanes a creature without feelings to
be displayed and shown off when it pleased them and ignored when
it did not Mrs Armstrong was always quietly cheerful and
friendly when they met in the yard or about the premises but she
neither intruded nor patronized Jeds first impression of her a
favorable one was strengthened daily

I like her firstrate he told Captain Sam She aint too
folksy and she aint too standoffish Why honest truth Sam he
added ingenuously she treats me just the same as if I was like
the common run of folks

The captain snorted Gracious king Do stop runnin yourself
down he commanded Suppose you are a little miteerdifferent
from thewell from the heft of mackerel in the keg what of it
Thats your own private business aint it

Jeds lip twitched I suppose tis he drawled If it want
there wouldnt be so many folks interested in it

At first he missed the freedom to which he had accustomed himself
during his years of solitude the liberty of preparing for bed with
the doors and windows toward the sea wide open and the shades not
drawn of strolling out to the well at unearthly hours of the early
morning singing at the top of his lungs of washing face and hands
in a tin basin on a bench by that well curb instead of within
doors There were some necessary concessions to convention to
which his attention was called by Captain Hunniwell who took it
upon himself to act as a sort of social mentor

Do you always wash outdoors there asked the captain after
watching one set of ablutions

Whyeryes I most generally do in good weather Its sort of
erwell sort of cool and roomy as you might say

Roomy eh Gracious king Well I should say you needed room
You splash into that basin like a kedge anchor goin overboard and
when you come out of it you puff like a grampus comin up to blow
How do you callate Mrs Armstrong enjoys seein you do that

Jed looked startled and much disturbed Eh he exclaimed Why
I never thought about her Sam I declare I never did IIll
fetch the wash basin inside this very minute

And he did The inconvenience attached to the breaking off of a
summertime habit of years troubled him not half as much as the
fear that he might have offended a fellow creatures sensibilities
Jed Winslow was far too sensitive himself and his own feelings had
been hurt too many times to make hurting those of another a small
offense in his eyes

But these were minor inconveniences attached to his new position as
landlord There were recompenses At work in his shop he could
see through the window the whiteclad graceful figure of Mrs
Armstrong moving about the yard sitting with Barbara on the bench
by the edge of the bluff or writing a letter at a table she had
taken out under the shadow of the silverleaf tree Gradually Jed
came to enjoy seeing her there to see the windows of the old house
open to hear voices once more on that side of the shop and to
catch glimpses of Babbie dancing in and out over the shining mica
slab at the door

He liked the child when he first met her but he had been a little
fearful that as a neighbor she might trouble him by running in
and out of the shop interfering with his privacy and his work or
making a small nuisance of herself when he was waiting on
customers But she did none of these things in fact she did not
come into the shop at all and after the first week had passed he
began to wonder why Late that afternoon seeing her sitting on
the bench by the bluff edge her doll in her arms he came out of
the door of his little kitchen at the back of the shop and called
her

Good evenin he hailed Takin in the view was you

She bobbed her head Yes sir she called in reply Petunia and
I were looking at it

Sho Well what do you anderWhatshername think of it

Barbara pondered We think its very nice she announced after
a moment Dont you like it Mr Winslow

Eh Oh yes I like it I guess I aint really had time to look
at it today been too busy

The child nodded sympathetically Thats too bad she said
Jed had for him a curious impulse and acted upon it

Maybe I might come and look at it now if I was asked he
suggested Plenty of room on that bench is there

Oh yes sir theres lots I dont take much room and Petunia
almost always sits on my lap Please come

So Jed came and sitting down upon the bench looked off at the
inlet and the beach and the ocean beyond It was the scene most
familiar to him one he had seen under varying weather conditions
through many summers and winters This very thought was in his
mind as he looked at it now

After a time he became aware that his companion was speaking

Eh he ejaculated coming out of his reverie Did you say
somethin

Yes sir three times I guess you were thinking werent you

Ummyes I shouldnt be surprised Its one of my bad habits
thinkin is

She looked hard to see if he was smiling but he was not and she
accepted the statement as a serious one

Is thinking a bad habit she asked I didnt know it was

Callate it must be If it wasnt more folks would do it Tell
me now he added changing the subject to avoid further cross
questioning do you and your ma like it here

The answer was enthusiastic Oh yes she exclaimed we like it
ever and ever so much Mamma says its Barbara hesitated and
then after what was evidently a severe mental struggle finished
with she said once it was like paradise after category

Afterwhich

The young lady frowned It doesnt seem to me she observed
slowly as if category was what she said Does category sound
right to you Mr Winslow

Jed looked doubtful I shouldnt want to say that it did right
offhand like this he drawled

Noo I dont believe it was category But Im almost sure it
was something about a cat something a cat eatsor doesor
something Mewmousemilk she was wrinkling her forehead and
repeating the words to herself when Mr Winslow had an inspiration

Twant purgatory was it he suggested

Miss Barbaras head bobbed enthusiastically Purrgatory that
was it she declared And it was something a cat doespurr
you know I knew it was Mamma said living here was paradise
after purrgatory

Jed rubbed his chin

I callate your ma didnt care much for the board at Luretta
Smalleys he observed He couldnt help thinking the remark an
odd one to make to a child

Oh I dont think she meant Mrs Smalleys explained Barbara
She liked Mrs Smalleys pretty well well as any one can like
boarding you know this last plainly another quotation I think
she meant she liked living here so much better than she did living
in Middleford where we used to be

Hum was the only comment Jed made He was surprised
nevertheless Judged by what Captain Sam had told him the
Armstrong home at Middleford should have been a pleasant one
Barbara rattled on

I guess that was it she observed She was sort of talking to
herself when she said it She was writing a letterto Uncle
Charlie I think it wasand I and Petunia asked her if she liked
it here and she sort of looked at me without looking same as you
do sometimes Mr Winslow when youre thinking of something else
and then she said that about the cattyno the purrgatory And
when I asked her what purrgatory meant she said Never mind
and    Oh I forgot in consternation she told me I mustnt
tell anybody she said it either Oh dear me

Jed hastened to reassure her Never mind he declared Ill
forget you ever did say it Ill start in forgettin now In five
minutes or so Ill have forgot two words of it already By to
morrow mornin I wouldnt remember it for money

Truly

Truly bluely lay me down and cut me in twoly But whats this
youre sayin about your ma lookin at things without seein em
same as I do She dont do that does she

The young lady nodded Yes she said course not as badI mean
not as often as you do but sometimes specially since She
hastily clapped her hand over her mouth Oh she exclaimed

Whats the matter Toothache

No Only I almost told another somethin I mustnt

Sho Well Im glad you put on the cover just in time

So am I What else was I talking about Oh yes Mammas
thinking so hard same as you do Mr Winslow You know she
added earnestly she acts quite a lot like you sometimes

Jed looked at her in horror Good Lord he exclaimed Then in
his solemnest drawl he added You tell her to take somethin for
it afore its too late

As he rose from the bench he observed Havent seen you over to
the shop since you moved in Ive been turnin out another school
of swordfish and whales too Why dont you run in and look em
over

She clapped her hands Oh may I she cried Ive wanted to
ever and ever so much but Mamma said not to because it might annoy
you Wouldnt it annoy you TRULY

Not a bit

Oh goody And might Petunia come too

Umhm Only gravely shell have to promise not to talk too
much Think shell promise that All right then fetch her along

So the very next morning when Jed was busy at the bandsaw he was
not greatly surprised when the door opened and Miss Barbara
appeared with Petunia in her arms He was surprised however and
not a little embarrassed when Mrs Armstrong followed

Good morning said the lady pleasantly I came over to make
sure that there hadnt been a mistake You really did ask Babby to
come in and see you at work

Yes maam II did I did sartin

And you dont mind having her here She wont annoy you

Not a mite Real glad to have her

Very well then she may stayan hour but no longer Mind
Babby dear I am relying on you not to annoy Mr Winslow

So the juvenile visitor stayed her hour and then obediently went
away in spite of Jeds urgent invitation to stay longer She had
asked a good many questions and talked almost continuously but Mr
Winslow instead of being bored by her prattle was surprised to
find how empty and uninteresting the shop seemed after she had
quitted it

She came again the next day and the next By the end of the week
Jed had become sufficiently emboldened to ask her mother to permit
her to come in the afternoon also This request was the result of
a conspiracy between Barbara and himself

You ask your ma urged Jed Tell her I say I need you here
afternoons

Barbara looked troubled But that would be a wrong story
wouldnt it she asked You dont really need me you know

Eh Yes I do yes I do

What for What shall I tell her you need me for

Jed scratched his chin with the tail of a wooden whale

You tell her he drawled after considering for a minute or two
that I need you to help carry lumber

Even a child could not swallow this ridiculous excuse Barbara
burst out laughing

Why Mr Winslow she cried You dont either You know I
couldnt carry lumber Im too little I couldnt carry any but
the littlest tiny bit

Jed nodded gravely Yes sartin he agreed thats what I need
you to carry You run along and tell her so thats a good girl

But she shook her head vigorously No she declared She would
say it was silly and it would be Besides you dont really need
me at all You just want Petunia and me for company same as we
want you Isnt that it truly

Umm Well I shouldnt wonder You can tell her that if you
want to Id just as soon

The young lady still hesitated Noo she said because shed
think perhaps you didnt really want me but was too polite to say
so If you asked her yourself though I think shed let me come

At first Jeds bashfulness was up in arms at the very idea but at
length he considered to ask Mrs Armstrong for the permission It
was granted as soon as the lady was convinced that the desire for
more of her daughters society was a genuine one and thereafter
Barbara visited the windmill shop afternoons as well as mornings
She sat her doll in her arms upon a box which she soon came to
consider her own particular and private seat watching her long
legged friend as he sawed or glued or jointed or painted He had
little waiting on customers to do now for most of the summer
people had gone His small visitor and he had many long and to
them interesting conversations

Other visitors to the shop those who knew him well were surprised
and amused to find him on such confidential and intimate terms with
a child Gabe Bearse after one short call reported about town
that crazy Shavins Winslow had taken up with a youngone just
about as crazy as he was

There she set declared Gabriel on a box hugging a broken
nosed doll baby up to her and starin at me and Shavins as if we
was some kind of curiosities as you might say Well one of us
was eh Haw haw She didnt say a word and Shavins he never
said nothin and I felt as if I was preaching in a deef and dumb
asylum Finally I happened to look at her and I see her lips
movin Well says I you CAN talk cant you sis even if
its only to yourself What was you talkin to yourself about
eh She didnt seem to want to answer just sort of reddened up
you know but I kept right after her Finally she owned up she was
countin What was you countin says I Well she didnt want
to tell that neither Finally I dragged it out of her that she
was countin how many words Id said since I started to tell about
Melissy Busteed and what she said about Luther Smalls wifes aunt
the one thats so wheezed up with asthma and Doctor Parker dont
seem to be able to do nothin to help So you was countin my
words was you says I Well thats good business I must say
How many have I said She looked solemn and shook her head I
had to give it up says she It makes my head ache to count fast
very long Doesnt it give you a headache to count fast Mr
Winslow Jed he mumbled some kind of foolishness about some
things givin him earache I laughed at the two of em Humph
says I the only kind of aches I have is them in my bones
meanin my rheumatiz you understand Shavins he looked moony up
at the roof for about a week and a half same as hes liable to do
and then he drawled out You see he DOES have headache Babbie
says he Now did you ever hear such fool talk outside of an
asylum He and that Armstrong kid are well matched No wonder she
sits in there and gapes at him half the day

Captain Sam Hunniwell and his daughter were hugely tickled

Jeds got a girl at last crowed the captain Id about given
up hope Jed I was fearful that the bloom of your youth would
pass away from you and you wouldnt keep company with anybody
Youre so bashful that I know youd never call on a young woman
but I never figured that one might begin callin on you Course
shes kind of extra young but shell grow out of that give her
time

Maud Hunniwell laughed merrily enjoying Mr Winslows confusion
Oh the little girl is only the bait Father she declared It
is the pretty widow that Jed is fishing for Shell be calling
here soon or hell be calling there Isnt that true Jed Own
up now Oh see him blush Father Just see him

Jed of course denied that he was blushing His fair tormentor
had no mercy

You must be she insisted At any rate your face is very very
red Ill leave it to Father Isnt his face red Father

Red as a flannel lungprotector declared Captain Sam who was
never known to contradict his only daughter nor so report
affirmed deny a request of hers

Of course it is triumphantly And it cant be the heat
because it isnt at all warm here

Poor Jed the longsuffering was goaded into a mild retort

Theres considerble hot air in here some spells he drawled
mournfully Miss Hunniwell went away reaffirming her belief that
Mr Winslows friendship for the daughter was merely a strategical
advance with the mother as the ultimate objective

Youll see Father she prophesied mischievously We shall
hear of his keeping company with Mrs Armstrong soon Oh he
couldnt escape even if he wanted to These young widows are
perfectly irresistible

When they were a safe distance from the windmill shop the captain
cautioned his daughter

Maud he said youd better not tease Jed too much about that
goodlookin tenant of his Hes so queer and so bashful that Im
afraid if you do hell take a notion to turn the Armstrongs out
when this months up

Miss Hunniwell glanced at him from the corner of her eye

Suppose he does she asked What of it She isnt a GREAT
friend of yours is she Father

It was the captains turn to look embarrassed

No no course she aint he declared hastily All Ive been
thinkin is that Jed ought to have a tenant in that house of his
because he needs the money And from what Ive been able to find
out about this Mrs Armstrong shes a real nice genteel sort of
body andander

And shes very sweet and very pretty and so of course naturally
all the men especially the middleaged men

Captain Sam interrupted explosively Dont be so foolish he
ordered If you dont stop talkin such nonsense IllI dont
know what Ill do to you What do you suppose her bein sweet and
goodlookin has got to do with me Gracious king Ive got one
goodlookinerthat is to say Ive got one young female to take
care of now and thats enough in all conscience

His daughter pinched his arm

Oh ho she observed You were going to say she was good
looking and then you changed your mind Dont you think this young
femaleWHAT a word you ought to be ashamed of itDONT you think
she is goodlooking Daddy dear

She looked provokingly up into his face and he looked fondly down
into hers

Dont you she repeated

Well II dont know as Id want to go so far as to say that I
presume likely her face might not stop a meetinhouse clock on a
dark night but

As they were in a secluded spot where a high hedge screened them
from observation Miss Maud playfully boxed her parents ears a
proceeding which he seemed to enjoy hugely

But there was reason in the captains caution nevertheless Miss
Mauds teasing concerning the widow had set Jed to thinking The
trial month was almost up In a little while he would have to
give his decision as to whether the little Winslow house was to
continue to be occupied by Barbara and her mother or whether it
was to be as it had been for years closed and shuttered tight
He had permitted them to occupy it for that month on the spur of
the moment as the result of a promise made upon impulse a
characteristic Jed Winslow impulse Now however he must decide
in cold blood whether or not it should be theirs for another eleven
months at least

In his conversation with Captain Sam the conversation which took
place immediately after the Armstrongs came he had stoutly
maintained that the latter would not wish to stay longer than the
month that his own proximity as landlord and neighbor would be
unbearable longer than that period But if the widow found it so
she had so far shown no evidence of her disgust Apparently that
means of breaking off the relationship could not be relied upon
Of course he did not know whether or not she wished to remain but
if she did did he wish her to do so There was nothing personal
in the matter it was merely the question as to whether his
prejudice of years against renting that house to any one was to
rule or be overthrown If she asked him for his decision what
should he say At night when he went to bed his mind was made
up In the morning when he arose it was unmade As he told
Captain Hunniwell Im like that old clock I used to have Sam
The pendulum of that thing used to work fine but the hands
wouldnt move Same way with me I tick tick tick all day over
this pesky business but I dont get anywheres Its always half
past nothin

Captain Sam was hugely disgusted It aint moren quarter past
if it is that he declared emphatically Its just nothin if
you ask me And say speakin of askin Id like to ask you this
How are you goin to get em out provided youre fool enough to
decide theyve got to go Are you goin to tell Mrs Armstrong
right up and down and flatfooted that you cant stand any more of
her Id like to hear you say it Let me know when the shows
goin to come off I want a seat in the front row

Poor Jed looked aghast at the very idea His friend laughed
derisively and walked off and left him And the days passed and
the trial month drew closer and closer to its end until one
morning he awoke to realize that that end had come the month was
up that very day

He had not mentioned the subject to the widow nor had she to him
His reasons for not speaking were obvious enough one was that he
did not know what to say and the other that he was afraid to say
it But as the time approached when the decision must be made he
had expected that she would speak And she had not He saw her
daily sometimes several times a day She often came into the shop
to find Barbara who made the workroom a playhouse on rainy or
cloudy days and she talked with him on other topics but she did
not mention this one

It was raining on this particular day the last day in the trial
month and Jed working at his lathe momentarily expected Barbara
to appear with Petunia under one arm and a bundle of dolls
clothes under the other to announce casually that as it was such
bad weather they had run in to keep him Mr Winslow from getting
lonesome There was precious little opportunity to be lonesome
where Babbie was

But this morning the child did not come and Jed wondering what the
reason for her absence might be began to feel vaguely
uncomfortable Just what was the matter he did not know but that
there was something wrong with him Jed Winslow was plain He
could not seem to keep his mind on his work he found himself
wandering to the window and looking out into the yard where the
lilac bushes whipped and thrashed in the gusts the overflowing
spouts splashed and gurgled and the sea beyond the edge of the
bluff was a troubled stretch of gray and white seen through
diagonal streaks of winddriven rain And always when he looked
out of that window he glanced toward the little house next door
hoping to see a small figure bundled under a big rain coat and
sheltered by a big umbrella dodge out of the door and race across
the yard toward the shop

But the door remained shut the little figure did not appear and
except for the fact that the blinds were not closed and that there
was smoke issuing from the chimney of the kitchen the little house
might have been as empty as it had been the month before

Or as it might be next month The thought came to Jed with a
meaning and emphasis which it had not brought before A stronger
gust than usual howled around the eaves of the shop the sashes
rattled the panes were beaten by the flung raindrops which pounded
down in watery sheets to the sills and Jed suddenly diagnosed his
own case he knew what was the matter with himhe was lonesome
he who had lived alone for five years and had hoped to live alone
for the rest of his life was lonesome

He would not admit it even to himself it was ridiculous He was
not lonesome he was just a little blue that was all It was
the weather he might have caught a slight cold perhaps his
breakfast had not agreed with him He tried to remember what that
breakfast had been It had been eaten in a hurry he had been
thinking of something else as usual and except that it consisted
of various odds and ends which he had happened to have on hand he
could not itemize it with exactness There had been some cold
fried potatoes and some warmedover popovers which had slumped
in the cooking and a doughnut or two andoh yes a saucer of
canned peaches which had been sitting around for a week and which
he had eaten to get out of the way These with a cup of warmed
over coffee made up the meal Jed couldnt see why a breakfast of
that kind should make him blue And yet he was blueyes and
there was no use disguising the fact he was lonesome If that
child would only come as she generally did her nonsense might
cheer him up a bit But she did not come And if he decided not
to permit her mother to occupy the house she would not come much
more Eh Why it was the last day of the month She might never
come again

Jed shut off the motor and turned away from the lathe He sank
down into his little chair drew his knee up under his chin and
thought long and seriously When the knee slid down to its normal
position once more his mind was made up Mrs Armstrong might
remain in the little housefor a few months more at any rate
Even if she insisted upon a years lease it wouldnt do any great
harm He would wait until she spoke to him about it and then he
would give his consent Andand it would please Captain Sam at
any rate

He rose and going to the window looked out once more across the
yard What he saw astonished him The back door of the house was
partially open and a man was just coming out The man in dripping
oilskins and a souwester was Philander Hardy the local
expressman Philander turned and spoke to some one in the house
behind him Jed opened the shop door a crack and listened

Yes maam he heard Hardy say Ill be back for em about four
oclock this afternoon Rain may let up a little mite by that
time and anyhow Ill have the covered wagon Your trunks wont
get wet maam Ill see to that

A minute later Jed an old sweater thrown over his head and
shoulders darted out of the front door of his shop The express
wagon with Hardy on the drivers seat was just moving off Jed
called after it

Hi Philander he called raising his voice only a little for
fear of being overheard at the Armstrong house Hi Philander
come here a minute I want to see you

Mr Hardy looked over his shoulder and then backed his equipage
opposite the Winslow gate

Hello Jedidah Shavins he observed with a grin Didnt know
you for a minute with that shawl over your front crimps What you
got on your mind anything except sawdust

Jed was too much perturbed even to resent the loathed name Jedidah

Philander he whispered anxiously say Philander what does
she want Mrs Armstrong I mean What is it youre comin back
for at four oclock

Philander looked down at the earnest face under the ancient
sweater Then he winked solemnly

Well I tell you Shavins he said You see I dont know how
tis but woman folks always seem to take a terrible shine to me
Now this Mrs Armstrong here Say shes some peach aint she
she aint seen me moren half a dozen times but here she is
beggin me to fetch her my photograph Its rainin pretty hard
today I says Wont it do if I fetch it tomorrow But no
she

Jed held up a protesting hand I dont doubt she wants your
photograph Philander he drawled Your kind of face is rare
But I heard you say somethin about comin for trunks Whose
trunks

Whose Why hers and the youngones I presume likely Twas
them I fetched from Luretta Smalleys Now she wants me to take
em back there

A tremendous gust driven in from the sea tore the sweater from
the Winslow head and shoulders and wrapped it lovingly about one of
the posts in the yard Jed did not offer to recover it he
scarcely seemed to know that it was gone Instead he stood staring
at the express driver while the rain ran down his nose and dripped
from its tip to his chin

Sheshes goin back to Luretta Smalleys he repeated She

He did not finish the sentence Instead he turned on his heel and
walked slowly back to the shop The sweater wrapped about the
post where in summer a wooden sailor brandished his paddles
flapped soggily in the wind Hardy gazed after him

What in time he exclaimed Then raising his voice he
called Hi Jed Jed You crazy critter WhatJed hold on a
minute didnt you know she was goin Didnt she tell you Jed

But Jed had entered the shop and closed the door Philander drove
off shaking his head and chuckling to himself

A few minutes later Mrs Armstrong hearing a knock at the rear
door of the Winslow house opened it to find her landlord standing
on the threshold He was bareheaded and he had no umbrella

Why Mr Winslow she exclaimed It was the first time that he
had come to that house of his own accord since she had occupied it
Now he stood there in the rain looking at her without speaking

Why Mr Winslow she said again What is it Come in wont
you Youre soaking wet Come in

Jed looked down at the sleeves of his jacket Eh he drawled
slowly Wet Why I dont knows I ainta little Itsits
rainin

Raining Its pouring Come in

She took him by the arm and led him through the woodshed and into
the kitchen She would have led him further into the sitting
room but he hung back

No maam no he said II guess Ill stay here if you dont
mind

There was a patter of feet from the sittingroom and Barbara came
running Petunia in her arms At the sight of their visitors
lanky form the childs face brightened

Oh Mr Winslow she cried Did you come to see where Petunia
and I were Did you

Jed looked down at her Whywhy I dont knows I didnt he
admitted II kind of missed you I guess

Yes and we missed you You see Mamma said we mustnt go to the
shop today because Oh Mamma perhaps he has come to tell you
we wont have to

Mrs Armstrong interrupted Hush Babbie she said quickly I
told Barbara not to go to visit you today Mr Winslow She has
been helping me with the packing

Jed swallowed hard Packin he repeated Youve been packin
Then twas true what Philander Hardy said about your goin back to
Lurettas

The lady nodded Yes she replied Our month here ends today
Of course you knew that

Jed sighed miserably Yes maam he said I knew it but I
only just realized it as you might say I    Hum   
Well   

He turned away and walked slowly toward the kitchen door Barbara
would have followed but her mother laid a detaining hand upon her
shoulder On the threshold of the door between the diningroom and
kitchen Jed paused

Maam he said hesitatingly youyou dont callate theres
anything I can do toto help is there Anything in the packin
or movin or anything like that

No thank you Mr Winslow The packing was very simple

Eryes maam    Yes maam

He stopped seemed about to speak again but evidently changed his
mind for he opened the door and went out into the rain without
another word Barbara very much surprised and hurt looked up
into her mothers face

Why Mamma she cried hashas he GONE He didnt say goodby
to us oror anything He didnt even say he was sorry we were
going

Mrs Armstrong shook her head

I imagine that is because he isnt sorry my dear she replied
You must remember that Mr Winslow didnt really wish to let any
one live in this house We only came here bywell by accident

But Barbara was unconvinced

He ISNT glad she declared stoutly He doesnt act that way
when he is glad about things You see she added with the air of
a Mrs Methusaleh Petunia and I know him better than you do
Mamma weve had more chances to getto get acquainted

Perhaps an hour later there was another knock at the kitchen door
Mrs Armstrong when she opened it found her landlord standing
there one of his largest windmillsa toy at least three feet
highin his arms He bore it into the kitchen and stood it in the
middle of the floor holding the mammoth thing its peaked roof
high above his head and peering solemnly out between one of its
arms and its side

Why Mr Winslow exclaimed Mrs Armstrong

Yes maam said Jed II fetched it for Babbie I just kind
of thought maybe shed like it

Barbara clasped her hands

Oh she exclaimed Oh is it for me

Jed answered

Tis if you want it he said

Want it Why Mamma its one of the very best mills Its a
five dollar one Mamma

Mrs Armstrong protested Oh I couldnt let you do that Mr
Winslow she declared It is much too expensive a present And
besides

She checked herself just in time It had been on the tip of her
tongue to say that she did not know what they could do with it
Their rooms at Mrs Smalleys were not large It was as if a
dweller in a Harlem flat had been presented with a hippopotamus

The maker of the mill looked about him plainly seeking a place to
deposit his burden

Tisnt anything much he said hastily IIm real glad for
you to have it

He was about to put it on top of the cookstove in which there was
a roaring fire but Mrs Armstrong by a startled exclamation and a
frantic rush prevented his doing so So he put it on the table
instead Barbara thanked him profusely She was overjoyed there
were no comparisons with hippopotami in HER mind Jed seemed
pleased at her appreciation but he did not smile Instead he
sighed

II just thought I wanted her to have it maam he said
turning to Mrs Armstrong Twould keep her fromfrom forgettin
me altogether maybe    Not that theres any real reason why
she should remember me of course he added

Barbara was hurt and indignant

Of COURSE I shant forget you Mr Winslow she declared
Neither will Petunia And neither will Mamma I know She feels
awful bad because you dont want us to live here any longer and

Hush Babbie hush commanded her mother Barbara hushed but
she had said enough Jed turned a wondering face in their
direction He stared without speaking

Mrs Armstrong felt that some one must say something

You mustnt mind what the child says Mr Winslow she explained
hurriedly Of course I realize perfectly that this house is yours
and you certainly have the right to do what you please with your
own And I have known all the time that we were here merely on
trial

Jed lifted a big hand

Ererjust a minute maam please he begged II guess my
wooden head is beginnin to splinter or somethin Please answer
me just thisifif youd just as soon Why are you movin back to
Lurettas

It was her turn to look wonderingly at him Why Mr Winslow
she said after a moments hesitation isnt that rather an
unnecessary question When Babbie and I came here it was with the
understanding that we were to be on trial for a month We had gone
into no details at all except that the rent for this one month
should be forty dollars You were as I understood it to consider
the question of our staying and if you liked us and liked the idea
of renting the house at all you were to come to me and discuss the
matter The month is up and you havent said a word on the
subject And knowing what your feelings HAD been I of course
realized that you did not wish us to remain and so of course we
are going I am sorry very sorry Babbie and I love this little
house and we wish you might have cared to have us stay in it but

Hold on hold on Jed was for him almost energetic Mrs
Armstrong maam do you mean to tell me youre goin back to
Luretta Smalleys because you think I dont want you to stay Is
that it honest truth

Why of course it is What else

Andand taint because you cant stand me any longer same as
Mother used to say

Cant stand you Your mother used to say What DO you mean Mr
Winslow

I meanI mean you aint goin because I used to wash my face out
in the yard andand holler and sing mornins and look so
everlastin homelyandand be what everybody calls a town crank
and

Mr Winslow PLEASE

Andand you and Babbie would stay right here ifif you thought I
wanted you to

Why of course But you dont do you

Before Jed could answer the outside door was thrown open without
knock or preliminary warning and Captain Sam Hunniwell dripping
water like a longhaired dog after a bath strode into the kitchen

Mornin maam he said nodding to Mrs Armstrong Then
turning to the maker of windmills Youre the feller Im lookin
for he declared Is what Philander Hardy told me just now true
Is it

Jed was dreamily staring out of the window He was smiling a
seraphic smile Receiving no reply Captain Sam angrily repeated
his question Is it true he demanded

Noo no I guess tisnt Id know better if I knew what he told
you

He told me that Mrs Armstrong here was movin back to Luretta
Smalleys today Jed Winslow have you been big enough fool

Jed held up the big hand

Yes he said I always am

You always arewhat

A big enough fool Sam what is a lease

What is a lease

Yes Never mind tellin me show me Make out a lease of this
house to Mrs Armstrong here

Mrs Armstrong was naturally rather surprised

Why Mr Winslow she cried what are you talking about We
havent agreed upon rent or

Yes we have Weve agreed about everything ErBabbie you get
your things on and come on over to the shop You and I mustnt be
sittin round here any longer Weve got to get to WORK


CHAPTER VII


And so in as sudden a fashion as he had granted the months
trial did Jed grant the permanent tenure of his property The
question of rent which might easily have been with the ordinary
sort of landlord a rock in the channel turned out to be not even
a pebble Captain Hunniwell who was handling the business
details including the making out of the lease was somewhat
troubled

But Jed he protested youve GOT to listen to me She wont
pay forty a month although she agrees with me that for a furnished
house in a location like this its dirt cheap Of course shes
takin it for all the year which does make considerble
difference although from May to October when the summer folks are
here I could get a hundred and forty a month just as easy as   
Eh I believe you aint heard a word Ive been sayin Gracious
king If you aint enough to drive the mate of a cattle boat into
gettin religion Do you hear me I say she wont pay

Jed who was sitting before the battered old desk in the corner of
his workshop did not look around but he waved his right hand the
fingers of which held the stump of a pencil over his shoulder

Sshh shh Sam he observed mildly Dont bother me now
please dont theres a good feller Im tryin to work out
somethin important

Well this is important Or if it aint theres plenty that is
important waitin for me up at the bank Im handlin this house
business as a favor to you If you think Ive got nothin else to
do youre mistaken

Jed nodded contritely and turned to face his friend I know it
Sam he said I know it I havent got the least mite of excuse
for troublin you

You aint troublin menot that way All I want of you is to say
yes or no I tell you Mrs Armstrong thinks she cant afford to
pay forty a month

Yes

And perhaps she cant But youve got your own interests to think
about What shall I do

Yes

YES What in time are you sayin yes for

Hum Eh Oh excuse me Sam I didnt mean yes I mean no

Gracious king

Wellerer desperately you told me to say yes or no so I

See here Jed Winslow HAVE you heard what Ive been sayin

Why no Sam honest I aint Ive run across an idea about
makin a different kind of millone like a gull you know thatll
flap its wings up and down when the wind blowsanderIm afraid
my head is solid full of that and nothin else There generally
aint moren room for one idea in my head he added apologetically
Sometimes that one gets kind of cramped

The captain snorted in disgust Jed looked repentant and distressed

Im awful sorry Sam he declared But if its about that house
of minerent or anything you just do whatever Mrs Armstrong says

Whatever SHE says Havent you got anything to say

No noo I dont knows I have You see Ive settled that she
and Babbie are to have the house for as long as they want it so
its only fair to let them settle the rest seems to me Whatever
Mrs Armstrong wants to payll be all right You just leave it to
her

Captain Sam rose to his feet

Ive a dum good mind to he declared Twould serve you right if
she paid you ten cents a year Then with a glance of disgust at
the mountain of old letters and papers piled upon the top of the
desk where his friend was at work he added What do you clean
that desk of yours witha shovel

The slow smile drifted across the Winslow face I callate thats
what I should have to use Sam he drawled if I ever cleaned
it

The captain and the widow agreed upon thirtyfive dollars a month
It developed that she owned their former house in Middleford and
that the latter had been rented for a very much higher rent My
furniture she added that which I did not sell when we gave up
housekeeping is stored with a friend there I know it is
extravagant my hiring a furnished house but Im sure Mr Winslow
wouldnt let this one unfurnished and besides it would be a crime
to disturb furniture and rooms which fit each other as these do
And after all at the end of a year I may wish to leave Orham Of
course I hope I shall not but I may

Captain Sam would have asked questions concerning her life in
Middleford in fact he did ask a few but the answers he received
were unsatisfactory Mrs Armstrong evidently did not care to talk
on the subject The captain thought her attitude a little odd but
decided that the tragedy of her husbands death must be the cause
of her reticence Her parting remarks on this occasion furnished
an explanation

If you please Captain Hunniwell she said I would rather you
did not tell any one about my having lived in Middleford and my
affairs there I have told very few people in Orham and I think on
the whole it is better not to What is the use of having ones
personal history discussed by strangers

She was evidently a trifle embarrassed and confused as she said
this for she blushed just a little Captain Sam decided that the
blush was becoming Also as he walked back to the bank he
reflected that Jed Winslows tenant was likely to have her personal
history and affairs discussed whether she wished it or not Young
women as attractive as she were bound to be discussed especially
in a community the size of Orham And besides whoever else she
may have told she certainly had told him that Middleford had
formerly been her home and he had told Maud and Jed Of course
they would say nothing if he asked them but perhaps they had told
it already And why should Mrs Armstrong care anyway

Let folks talk he said that evening in conversation with his
daughter Let em talk thats my motto When theyre lyin
about me I know they aint lyin about anybody else thats some
comfort But women folks I callate feel different

Maud was interested and a little suspicious

You dont suppose Pa she said that this Mrs Armstrong has a
past do you

A past What kind of a thing is a past for thunder sakes

Why I mean aawell has she done something she doesnt want
other people to know is she trying to hide something likewell
as people do in stories

Eh Oh in the books I see Well young woman I callate the
first thing for your dad to do is to find out what sort of books
you read A past Ho ho I guess likely Mrs Armstrong is a
plaguey sight more worried about the future than she is about the
past She has lived the past already but shes got to live the
future and pay the bills belongin to it and thats no triflin
job in futures like these days

Needless to say Jed Winslow did no speculating concerning his
tenants past Having settled the question of that tenancy
definitely and as he figured it forever he put the matter
entirely out of his mind and centered all his energies upon the new
variety of mill the gull which was to flap its wings when the wind
blew Barbara was of course much interested in the working out
of this invention and her questions were many Occasionally Mrs
Armstrong came into the shop She and Jed became better acquainted

The acquaintanceship developed Jed formed a daily habit of
stopping at the Armstrong door to ask if there were any errands to
be done downtown Goin right along down on my own account
maam was his invariable excuse Might just as well run your
errands at the same time Also whenever he chopped a supply of
kindling wood for his own use he chopped as much more and filled
the oilclothcovered box which stood by the stove in the Armstrong
kitchen He would not come in and sit down however in spite of
Barbaras and her mothers urgent invitation he was always too
busy for that

But the time came when he did come in actually come in and sit
down to a meal Barbara of course was partially responsible for
this amazing invitation but it was Heman Taylors old brindle
tomcat which really brought it to pass The cat in question was a
disreputable old scalawag with tattered ears and a scarred hide
souvenirs of fights innumerable with no beauty and less morals
and named with appropriate fitness Cherub

It was a quarter to twelve on a Sunday morning and Jed was
preparing his dinner The piece de resistance of the dinner was
in this instance to be a mackerel Jed had bought the mackerel of
the fish peddler the previous afternoon and it had been reposing on
a plate in the little ancient icechest which stood by the back
door of the Winslow kitchen Barbara just back from Sunday school
and arrayed in her best saw that back door open and decided to
call Jed as always was glad to see her

Youre getting dinner arent you Mr Winslow she observed

Jed looked at her over his spectacles Yes he answered
Unless somethin happens Im gettin dinner

His visitor looked puzzled

Why whatever happened you would be getting dinner just the same
wouldnt you she said You might not have it but youd be
getting it you know

Jed took the mackerel out of the icechest and put the plate
containing it on the top of the latter Weell he drawled you
cant always tell I might take so long gettin it that first
thing I knew twould be supper

Humming a hymn he took another dish from the icechest and placed
it beside the mackerel plate

Whats that inquired Barbara

That Oh thats my toppinoff layer Thats a rice puddin
poor mans puddin some folks call it I callate your mad call
it a mans poor puddin but it makes good enough ballast for a
craft like me He began singing again


 I know not yea I know not
 What bliss awaits me there
 Di doo de di di doo de


Breaking off to suggest Better stay and eat along with me today
hadnt you Babbie

Barbara tried hard not to seem superior

Thank you she said but I guess I cant Were going to have
chicken and lemon jelly Then remembering her manners she
added Wed be awful glad if youd have dinner with us Mr
Winslow

Jed shook his head

Much obliged he drawled but if I didnt eat that mackerel who
would

The question was answered promptly While Mr Winslow and his
small caller were chatting concerning the formers dinner another
eager personality was taking a marked interest in a portion of that
dinner Cherub the Taylor cat abroad on a foraging expedition
had scented from his perch upon a nearby fence a delicious and
appetizing odor Following his nose literally Cherub descended
from the fence and advanced sniffing as he came The odor was
fish fresh fish Cherubs green eyes blazed his advance became
crafty strategical determined He crept to the Winslow back
step he looked up through the open door he saw the mackerel upon
its plate on the top of the icechest

If I didnt eat that mackerel drawled Jed who would

There was a swoop through the air a scream from Barbara a crash
two crashes a momentary glimpse of a brindle cat with a mackerel
crosswise in its mouth and the ends dragging on the ground a
rattle of claws on the fence Then Jed and his visitor were left
to gaze upon a broken plate on the floor an overturned bowl on top
of the icechest and a lumpy rivulet of rice pudding trickling to
the floor

Oh Oh Oh cried Barbara wringing her hands in consternation

Jed surveyed the ruin of the poor mans pudding and gazed
thoughtfully at the top of the fence over which the marauder had
disappeared

Hum he mused Huum    Well I did callate I could get
a meal out of sight pretty fast myself butbutI aint in that
critters class

But your dinner wailed Barbara almost in tears Hes spoiled
ALL your dinner Oh the BAD thing I hate that Cherub cat I
HATE him

Mr Winslow rubbed his chin Weell he drawled again He
does seem to have done what you might call a finished job
Huum    Another offensive on theernotheastard
front all objectives attained Thats the way the newspapers
tell such things nowadays aint it    However theres no
use cryin over spilterpuddin Lucky theres eggs and milk
aboard the ship I shant starve anyhow

Barbara was aghast Eggs and milk she repeated Is THAT all
youve got for Sunday dinner Mr Winslow Why thats awful

Jed smiled and began picking up the fragments of the plate He
went to the closet to get a broom and when he came out again the
young lady had vanished

But she was back again in a few minutes her eyes shining

Mr Winslow she said Mamma sent me to ask if you could please
come right over to our house Sheshe wants to see you

Jed regarded her doubtfully Wants to see me he repeated
What for

The child shook her head her eyes sparkled more than ever Im
not sure she said but I think theres something she wants you
to do

Wondering what the something might be Jed promised to be over in a
minute or two Barbara danced away apparently much excited Mr
Winslow remembering that it was Sunday performed a hasty toilet
at the sink combed his hair put on his coat and walked across the
yard Barbara met him at the side door of the house

Mammas in the diningroom she said Come right in Mr
Winslow

So Jed entered the diningroom to find the table set and ready
with places laid for three instead of two and Mrs Armstrong
drawing back one of three chairs He looked at her

Good mornin maam he stammered Babbie she saidershe
said there was somethin you wanted me to do

The lady smiled There is she replied Babbie has told me
what happened to your dinner and she and I want you to sit right
down and have dinner with us Were expecting you everything is
ready and we shallyes we shall be hurt if you dont stay
Shant we Babbie

Barbara nodded vigorously Awfly she declared specially
Petunia You will stay wont you Mr Winslowplease

Poor Jed His agitation was great his embarrassment greater and
his excuses for not accepting the invitation numerous if not
convincing But at last he yielded and sat reluctantly down to the
first meal he had eaten in that house for five years

Mrs Armstrong realizing his embarrassment did not urge him to
talk and Barbara although she chattered continuously did not seem
to expect answers to her questions So Jed ate a little spoke a
little and thought a great deal And by the time dinner was over
some of his shyness and awkwardness had worn away He insisted
upon helping with the dishes and because she saw that he would be
hurt if she did not his hostess permitted him to do so

You see maam he said Ive been doin dishes for a
considerble spell more years than I like to count I ought to be
able to do em fair to middlin well But he added as much to
himself as to her I dont know as thats any sign Theres so
many things I ought to be able to do like other folksand cant
Im afraid you may not be satisfied after all maam he went on
I suppose youre a kind of an expert as you might say

She shook her head I fear Im no expert Mr Winslow she
answered just a little sadly so it seemed to him Barbara and I
are learning that is all

Nora used to do the dishes at home put in Barbara Mamma
hardly ever

Hush dear interrupted her mother Mr Winslow wouldnt be
interested

After considerable urging Jed consented to sit a while in the
livingroom He was less reluctant to talk by this time and the
war creeping into the conversation as it does into all
conversations nowadays they spoke of recent happenings at home and
abroad Mrs Armstrong was surprised to find how well informed her
landlord was concerning the world struggle its causes and its
progress

Why no maam he said in answer to a remark of hers I aint
read it up much as I know of except in the newspapers I aint
an educated man Maybe with his slow smilemaybe youve
guessed as much as that already

I know that you have talked more intelligently on this war than
any one else I have heard since I came to this town she declared
emphatically Even Captain Hunniwell has never in my hearing
stated the case against Germany as clearly as you put it just now
and I have heard him talk a good deal

Jed was evidently greatly pleased but he characteristically tried
not to show it Well now maam he drawled Im afraid you
aint been to the post office much mail times If youd just drop
in there some evenin and hear Gabe Bearse and Bluey Batcheldor
raise hob with the Kaiser youd understand why the confidence of
the Allies is unshaken as the Herald gave out this mornin

A little later he said reflectively

You know maam its an astonishin thing to me I cant get over
it my sittin here in this house eatin with you folks and
talkin with you like this

Mrs Armstrong smiled I cant see anything so very astonishing
about it she said

Cant you

Certainly not Why shouldnt you do itoften We are landlord
and tenant you and I but that is no reason so far as I can see
why we shouldnt be good neighbors

He shook his head

I dont knows you quite understand maam he said Its your
thinkin of doin it your askin me andand WANTIN to ask me
that seems so kind of odd Do you know he added in a burst of
confidence I dont suppose that leavin Sam Hunniwell out
another soul has asked me to eat at their house for ten year
Course Im far from blamin em for that you understand but

Wait Mr Winslow you had tenants in this house before

Yesm Davidson their names was

And did THEY never invite you here

Jed looked at her then away out of the window It was a moment
or two before he answered Then

Mrs Armstrong he said you knew I callate that I waser
kind of prejudiced against rentin anybody this house after the
Davidsons left

The lady trying not to smile nodded

Yes she replied Iwell I guessed as much

Yesm I was They would have took it again Im pretty sartin
if Id let em butbut somehow I couldnt do it No I couldnt
and I never meant anybody else should be here Seems funny to you
I dont doubt

Why no it was your property to do what you pleased with and I
am sure you had a reason for refusing

Yesm But I aint ever told anybody what that reason was Ive
told Sam a reason but twant the real one II guess likely
Ill tell it to you I imagine twill sound foolish enough Twas
just somethin I heard Colonel Davidson say thats all

He paused Mrs Armstrong did not speak After an interval he
continued

Twas one day along the last of the season The Davidsons had
company and theyd been in to see the shop and the mills and vanes
and one thing or nother They seemed nice pleasant enough folks
laughed a good deal but I didnt mind that I walked out into the
yard along with em and then after I left em I stood for a
minute on the front step of the shop with the open door between me
and this house here A minute or so later I heard em come into
this very room They couldnt see me count of the door but I
could hear them count of the windows bein open And then   
Huh    Oh well

He sighed and lapsed into one of his long fits of abstraction At
length Mrs Armstrong ventured to remind him

And then she asked

Eh Oh yes maam Well then I heard one of the compny say
I dont wonder you enjoy it here Ed he says That landlord of
yours is worth all the rent you pay and more Taint everybody
that has a dime museum right on the premises All hands laughed
and then Colonel Davidson said I thought youd appreciate him
he says Well have another session with him before you leave
Perhaps we can get him into the house here this evenin My wife
is pretty good at that she jollies him along Oh he swallows it
all the poor simpleton dont know when hes bein shown off

Mrs Armstrong uttered an exclamation

Oh she cried The brute

Yesm said Jed quietly that was what he said You see with
an apologetic twitch of the lip it came kind of sudden to me and
and it hurt Fact is II had noticed he and his wife waser
well nice anderfolksy as you might say but I never once
thought they did it for any reason but just because theywell
liked me maybe Course Id ought to have known better Fine
ladies and gentlemen like them dont take much fancy to dime museum
folks

There was just a trace of bitterness in his tone the first Mrs
Armstrong had ever noticed there Involuntarily she leaned toward
him

Dont Mr Winslow she begged Dont think of it again They
must have been beasts those people and they dont deserve a
moments thought And DONT call them ladies and gentlemen The
only gentleman there was yourself

Jed shook his head

If you said that around the village here he drawled somebody
might be for havin you sent to the asylum up to Taunton Course
Im much obliged to you but honest you hadnt ought to take the
risk

Mrs Armstrong smiled slightly but hers was a forced smile What
she had just heard told in her guests quaint language as a
statement of fact and so obviously with no thought of effect had
touched her more than any plea for sympathy could have done She
felt as if she had a glimpse into this mans simple trusting
sensitive soul And with that glimpse came a new feeling toward
him a feeling of pityyes and more than that a feeling of
genuine respect

He sighed again and rose to go I declare he said
apologetically I dont know what Ive been botherin you with all
this for As I said Ive never told that yarn to anybody afore
and I never meant to tell it I

But she interrupted him Please dont apologize she said Im
very glad you told it to me

I callate you think its a queer reason for lettin this house
stand empty all this time

No I think it was a very good one and Babbie and I are honored
to know that your estimate of us is sufficiently high to overcome
your prejudice

Well maam II guess its goin to be all right If you feel
you can get along with me for a landlord Id ought sartin to be
willin to have you for tenants Course I dont blame the
Davidsons in one way you understand but

I do I blame them in every way They must have been unspeakable
Mr Winslow I hope you will consider Babbie and me not merely
tenants and neighbors but friendsreal friends

Jed did not reply for at least a minute Then he said Im afraid
youll be kind of lonesome my friends are like corn sprouts in a
henyard few and scatterin

So much the better we shall feel that we belong to select
company

He did not thank her nor answer but walked slowly on through the
diningroom and kitchen where he opened the door and stepped out
upon the grass There he stood for a moment gazing at the sky
alternately puckering his lips and opening them but without saying
a word Mrs Armstrong and Barbara who had followed him watched
these facial gymnastics the lady with astonishment her daughter
with expectant interest

I know what he is doing that for Mamma she whispered Its
because hes thinking and dont know whether to whistle or not
When he thinks AWFUL hard hes almost sure to whistleor sing

Hush hush Babbie

Oh he wont hear us He hardly ever hears any one when hes
thinking like that And see Mamma he IS going to whistle

Sure enough their guest whistled a few mournful bars breaking off
suddenly to observe

I hope there want any bones in it

Bones in what What do you mean Mr Winslow queried Mrs
Armstrong who was puzzled to say the least

Eh Oh I hope there want any bones in that mackerel Hemans cat
got away with If there was it might choke or somethin

Good gracious I shouldnt worry over that possibility if I were
you I should scarcely blame you for wishing it might choke after
stealing your dinner

Mr Winslow shook his head That wouldnt do solemnly If it
choked it couldnt ever steal another one

But you dont WANT it to steal another one do you

Well if every one it stole meant my havin as good an afternoon
as this ones been Id

He stopped Barbara ventured to spur him on

Youd what she asked

Id give up whittlin weather vanes and go mackerelseinin for
the critters benefit Wellergood day maam

Good afternoon Mr Winslow We shall expect you again soon You
must be neighborly for remember we are friends now

Jed was half way across the yard but he stopped and turned

Mymy FRIENDS generally call me Jed he said Then his face
a bright red he hurried into the shop and closed the door


CHAPTER VIII


After this having broken the ice Jed as Captain Sam Hunniwell
might have expressed it kept the channel clear When he stopped
at the kitchen door of his tenants house he no longer invariably
refused to come in and sit down When he inquired if Mrs
Armstrong had any errands to be done he also asked if there were
any chores he might help out with When the old clocka genuine
Seth Willardon the wall of the livingroom refused to go he came
in sat down took the refractory timepiece in his arms and after
an hour of what he called putterin and jackleggin hung it up
again apparently in as good order as ever During the process he
whistled a little sang a hymn or two and talked with Barbara who
found the conversation a trifle unsatisfactory

He hardly EVER finished what he was going to say she confided to
her mother afterward Hed start to tell me a story and just as
he got to the most interesting part something about the clock would
seem toyou knowtrouble him and hed stop and when he began
again hed be singing instead of talking I asked him what made
him do it and he said he callated his works must be loose and
every once in a while his speaking trumpet fell down into his music
box Isnt he a funny man Mamma

He is indeed Babbie

Yes Petunia and I think heshes perfectly scrusheaking
Twas awful nice of him to fix our clock wasnt it Mamma

Yes dear

Yes And I know why he did it he told me Twas on Petunias
account He said not to let her know it but hed taken
considerble of a shine to her I think hes taken a shine to me
dont you Mamma

Im sure of it

So am I And I most guess hes taken one to you too Anyhow he
watches you such a lot and notices so many things He asked me to
day if you had been crying I said no You hadnt had you
Mamma

Mrs Armstrong evaded the question by changing the subject She
decided she must be more careful in hiding her feelings when her
landlord was about She had had no idea that he could be so
observing certainly he did not look it

But her resolution was a little late Jed had made up his mind
that something was troubling his fair tenant Again and again now
that he was coming to know her better and better he had noticed
the worn anxious look on her face and once before the day of the
clock repairing he had seen her when it seemed to him that she had
been crying He did not mention his observations or inferences to
any one even Captain Sam but he was sure he was right Mrs
Armstrong was worried and anxious and he did not like the idea He
wished he might help her but of course he could not Another man
a normal man one not looked upon by a portion of the community as
town crank might have been able to help might have known how to
offer his services and perhaps have them accepted but not he not
Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow But he wished he could She had
asked him to consider her a real friend and to Jed who had so
few a friend was a possession holy and precious

Meanwhile the war was tightening its grip upon Orham as upon every
city town and hamlet in the land At first it had been a thing to
read about in the papers to cheer for to keep the flags flying
But it had been far off unreal Then came the volunteering and
after that the draft and the reality drew a little nearer Work
upon the aviation camp at East Harniss had actually begun The
office buildings were up and the sheds for the workmen They were
erecting frames for the barracks so Gabriel Bearse reported The
sight of a uniform in Orham streets was no longer such a novelty as
to bring the population old and young to doors and windows Miss
Maud Hunniwell laughingly confided to Jed that she was beginning to
have hopes real hopes of seeing genuine gold lace some day soon

Captain Sam her father was busy Sessions of the Exemption Board
were not quite as frequent as at first but the captain declared
them frequent enough And volunteering went on steadily here and
there among young blood which having drawn a low number in the
draft was too impatient for active service to wait its turn
Gustavus Howes bookkeeper at the bank was one example Captain
Sam told Jed about it on one of his calls

Yep he said Gus has gone cleared out yesterday afternoon
Goin to one of the trainin camps to try to learn to be an
officer Eh What did I say to him Why I couldnt say nothin
could I but Hurrah and God bless you But its leavin a bad
hole in the bank just the same

Jed asked if the bank had any one in view to fill that hole
Captain Sam looked doubtful

Well he replied weve got somebody in view that would like to
try and fill it Barzilla Small was in to see me yesterday
afternoon and hes sartin that his boy LutherLute everybody
calls himis just the one for the place Hes been to work up in
Fall River in a bank so Barzilla says that would mean he must
have had some experience Whether hell do or not I dont know
but hes about the only candidate in sight these war times What
do you think of him Jed

Jed rubbed his chin To fill Gus Howes place he asked

Yes of course Didnt think I was figgerin on makin him
President of the United States did you

Hum    Weell    One time when I was a little shaver
Sam down to the fishhouse I tried on a pair of Capn Jabe Kellys
rubber boots You remember Capn Jabe Sam of course Do you
remember his feet

The captain chuckled My dad used to say Jabes feet reminded him
of a couple of chickenhalibut

Umhm    Well I tried on his boots and started to walk
across the wharf in em   

Well what of it Gracious king hurry up What happened

Eh    Oh nothin much only seemed to me Id had half of my
walk afore those boots began to move

Captain Hunniwell enjoyed the story hugely It was not until his
laugh had died away to a chuckle that its application to the bank
situation dawned upon him

Umph he grunted I see You callate that Lute Small will
fill Gus Howes job about the way you filled those boots eh You
may be right shouldnt wonder if you was but weve got to have
somebody and weve got to have him now So I guess likely well
let Lute sign on and wait till later to find out whether hes an
able seaman or aa

He hesitated groping for a simile Mr Winslow supplied one

Or a leak he suggested

Yes thats it Say have you heard anything from Leander Babbitt
lately

No nothin more than Gab Bearse was reelin off last time he was
in here How is Phin Babbitt Does he speak to you yet

Not a word But the looks he gives me when we meet would sour
milk Hes dead sartin that I had somethin to do with his boys
volunteerin and hell never forgive me for it Hes the best hand
at unforgivin I ever saw No no Wonder what hed say if he
knew twas you Jed that was really responsible

Jed shook his head but made no reply His friend was at the door

Any money to take to the bank he inquired Oh no I took what
you had yesterday didnt I Any errands you want done over to
Harniss Maud and I are goin over there in the car this
afternoon

Jed seemed to reflect Noo he said no I guess not   
Why yes I dont know but there is though If you see one of
those things the soldiers put on in the trenches Id wish youd buy
it for me You know what I meana gas mask

A gas mask Gracious king What on earth

Jed sighed Twould be considerble protection when Gabe Bearse
dropped in and started talkin he drawled solemnly

October came in clear and fine and on a Saturday in that month Jed
and Barbara went on their long anticipated picnic to the aviation
camp at East Harniss The affair was one which they had planned
together Barbara having heard much concerning aviation during
her days of playing and listening in the windmill shop had asked
questions She wished to know what an aviation was Jed had
explained whereupon his young visitor expressed a wish to go and
see for herself Couldnt you take Petunia and me some time Mr
Winslow she asked

Guess maybe so was the reply provided I dont forget it same
as you forget about not callin me Mr Winslow

Oh Im so sorry Petunia ought to have reminded me Cant you
take me some time Uncle Jed

He had insisted upon her dropping the Mr in addressing him
Your mas goin to call me Jed he told her that is to say I
hope she is and you might just as well I always answer fairly
prompt whenever anybody says Jed cause Im used to it When
they say Mr Winslow I have to stop and think a week afore I
remember who they mean

But Barbara having consulted her mother refused to address her
friend as Jed Mamma says it wouldnt be respectrespectaful
she said And I dont think it would myself You see youre
older than I am she added

Jed nodded gravely I dont know but I am a little now you
remind me of it he admitted Well I tell youcall me Uncle
Jed Thats got a handle to it but it aint so much like the
handle to an ice pitcher as Mister is Uncle Jed ll do wont
it

Barbara pondered Why she said doubtfully you arent my
uncle really If you were youd be Mammas brother likelike
Uncle Charlie you know

It was the second time she had mentioned Uncle Charlie Jed had
never heard Mrs Armstrong speak of having a brother and he
wondered vaguely why However he did not wonder long on this
particular occasion

Humph he grunted Well lets see I tell you Ill be your
stepuncle Thatll do wont it Youve heard of stepfathers
Umhm Well they aint real fathers and a stepuncle aint a
real uncle Now you think that over and see if that wont fix it
firstrate

The child thought it over And shall I call you StepUncle
Jed she asked

Eh    Um    Noo I guess I wouldnt Im only a back
stepuncle anywayI always come to the back steps of your house
you knowso I wouldnt say anything about the step part You ask
your ma and see what she says

So Barbara asked and reported as follows

She says I may call you Uncle Jed when its just you and I
together she said But when other people are around she thinks
Mr Winslow would be more respectaful

It was settled on that basis

Cant you take me to the aviation place sometime Uncle Jed
asked Barbara

Jed thought he could if he could borrow a boat somewhere and Mrs
Armstrong was willing that Barbara should go with him Both
permission and the boat were obtained the former with little
difficulty after Mrs Armstrong had made inquiries concerning Mr
Winslows skill in handling a boat the latter with more At last
Captain Perez Ryder being diplomatically approached told Jed he
might use his eighteen foot power dory for a day the only cost
being that entailed by purchase of the necessary oil and gasoline

It was a beautiful morning when they started on their six mile
sail or chug as Jed called it Mrs Armstrong had put up a
lunch for them and Jed had a bucket of clams a kettle a pail of
milk some crackers onions and salt pork the ingredients of a
possible chowder

Little mite late for longshore chowder picnics maam he said
but its a westerly wind and I callate twill be pretty balmy in
the lee of the pines Soons it gets any ways chilly well be
startin home Wish you were goin along too

Mrs Armstrong smiled and said she wished it had been possible for
her to go but it was not She looked pale that morning so it
seemed to Jed and when she smiled it was with an obvious effort

Youre not going without locking your kitchen door are you Mr
Jed she asked

Jed looked at her and at the door

Why he observed I aint locked that door have I I locked
the front one the one to the shop though Did you see the sign I
tacked on the outside of it

No I didnt

I didnt know but you might have I put on it Closed for the
day Inquire at Abijah Thompsons You see he added his eye
twinkling ever so little Bije Thompson lives in the last house
in the village two mile or more over to the westard

He does Then why in the world did you tell people to inquire
there

Oh if I didnt theyd be botherin you probably and I didnt
want em doin that If they want me enough to travel way over to
Bijes theyll come back here tomorrow I shouldnt wonder I
guess likely theyd have to Bije dont know anything about me

He rubbed his chin and then added

Maybe twould be a good notion to lock that kitchen door

They were standing at the edge of the bluff He sauntered over to
the kitchen closed the door and then opening the window beside
it reached in through that window and turned the key in the lock
of the door Leaving the key in that lock and the window still
open he came sauntering back again

There he drawled I guess everythings safe enough now

Mrs Armstrong regarded him in amused wonder Do you usually lock
your door on the inside in that way she asked

Eh    Oh yesm If I locked it on the outside Id have to
take the key with me and Im such an absentminded dumbhead Id
be pretty sure to lose it Come on Babbie All aboard


CHAPTER IX


The Araminta which was the name of Captain Perezs power dorya
name so the captain invariably explained wished onto her before
he bought herchugged along steadily if not swiftly The course
was always in protected water inside the outer beaches or through
the narrow channels between the sand islands and so there were no
waves to contend with and no danger Jed in the course of his
varied experience afloat and ashore had picked up a working
knowledge of gasoline engines and anyhow as he informed his small
passenger the Aramintas engine didnt need any expert handling
She runs just like some folks tongues just get her started and
shell clack along all day he observed adding philosophically
and thats a good thingin an engine

I know whose tongue youre thinking about Uncle Jed declared
Barbara Its Mr Gabe Bearses

Jed was much amused he actually laughed aloud Gabe and this
engine are different in one way though he said Its within
the bounds of human possibility to stop this engine

They threaded the last winding channel and came out into the bay
Across on the opposite shore the new sheds and lumber piles of
what was to be the aviation camp loomed raw and yellow in the
sunlight A brisk breeze ruffled the blue water and the pines on
the hilltops shook their heads and shrugged their green shoulders
The Araminta chugged across the bay rising and falling ever so
little on the miniature rollers

What shall we do Uncle Jed asked Barbara Shall we go to see
the camp or shall we have our chowder and luncheon first and then
go

Jed took out his watch shook it and held it to his eara
precautionary process rendered necessary because of his habit of
forgetting to wind itthen after a look at the dial announced
that as it was only halfpast ten perhaps they had better go to
the camp first

You see he observed if we eat now we shant hardly know
whether were late to breakfast or early to dinner

Barbara was surprised

Why Uncle Jed she exclaimed I had breakfast ever so long ago
Didnt you

I had it about the same time you did I callate But my
appetites older than yours and it dont take so much exercise I
guess thats the difference Well eat pretty soon Lets go and
look the place over first

They landed in a little cove on the beach adjoining the Government
reservation Jed declared it a good place to make a fire as it
was sheltered from the wind He anchored the boat at the edge of
the channel and then pulling up the tops of his longlegged rubber
boots carried his passenger ashore Another trip or two landed
the kettle the materials for the chowder and the lunch baskets
Jed looked at the heap on the beach and then off at the boat

Now he said slowly the question is what have I left aboard
that I ought to have fetched ashore and what have I fetched here
that ought to be left there    Hum    I wonder

What makes you think youve done anything like that Uncle Jed
asked Barbara

Eh    Oh I dont think it I know it Ive boarded with
myself for fortyfive year and I know if theres anything I can get
crosseyed Ill do it Just as likely as not Ive made the bucket
of clams fast to that rope out yonder and hove it overboard and
pretty soon youll see me tryin to make chowder out of the
anchor    Ah hum   well   


 As numberless as the sands on the seashore
 As numberless as the sands on the shore
 Oh what a sight twill be when the ransomed host we see
 As numberless as


Well what do you say Shall we heave ahead for the place where
Uncle Sams birds are goin to nesthis twolegged birds I mean

They walked up the beach a little way then turned inland climbed
a dune covered with beachgrass and emerged upon the flat meadows
which would soon be the flying field They walked about among the
sheds the frames of the barracks and inspected the office
building from outside There were gangs of workmen carpenters
plumbers and shovelers but almost no uniforms Barbara was
disappointed

But there ARE soldiers here she declared Mamma said there
were officer soldiers you know

I callate there aint very many yet explained her companion
Only the few thats in charge I guess likely By and by therell
be enough officers and men both but now theres only carpenters
and such

But there are SOME officer ones insisted Babbie I wonder
Oh see Uncle Jed through that windowsee arent those
soldiers Theyve got on soldier clothes

Jed presumed likely that they were Barbara nodded sagely And
theyre officers too she said Im sure they are because
theyre in the office Do they call them officers because they
work in offices Uncle Jed

After an hours walking about they went back to the place where
they had left the boat and Jed set about making the chowder
Barbara watched him build the fire and open the clams but then
growing tired of sitting still she was seized with an idea

Uncle Jed she asked cant you whittle me a shingle boat You
know you did once at our beach at home And theres the cunningest
little pond to sail it on Mamma would let me sail it there I
know cause it isnt a bit deep You come and see Uncle Jed

The pond was a puddle perhaps twenty feet across left by the
outgoing tide Its greatest depth was not more than a foot Jed
absentmindedly declared the pond to be safe enough but that he
could not make a shingle boat not having the necessary shingle

Would you if you had one persisted the young lady

Eh    Oh yes sartin I guess so

All right Here is one I picked it up on top of that little
hill I guess it blew there Its blowing ever so much harder up
there than it is here on the beach

The shingle boat being hurriedly made its owner begged for a paper
sail The other one you made me had a paper sail Uncle Jed

Jed pleaded that he had no paper Theres some wrapped round the
lunch he said but its all butter and such Twouldnt be any
good for a sail Ererdont you think wed better put off
makin the sail till we get home oror somewheres This chowder
is sort of on my conscience this minute

Babbie evidently did not think so She went away on an exploring
expedition In a few minutes she returned a sheet of paper in her
hand

It was blowing around just where I found the shingle she
declared Its a real nice place to find things up on that hill
place Uncle Jed

Jed took the paper looked at it absentlyhe had taken off his
coat during the firebuilding and his glasses were presumably in
the coat pocketand then hastily doubled it across thrust the
mast of the shingle boat through it at top and bottom and handed
the craft to his small companion

There he observed there she is launched rigged and all but
christened Call her thethe Geraniumthe Sunflowerwhats
the name of that doll baby of yours Oh yes the Petunia Call
her that and set her afloat

But Barbara shook her head

I think she said if you dont mind Uncle Jed I shall call
this one Ruth thats Mammas name you know The other one you
made me was named for Petunia and we wouldnt want to name em ALL
for her It might make her tootoo Oh what ARE those things
you make Uncle Jed In the shop I mean

Eh Windmills

No The othersthose you tell the wind with I knowvanes It
might make Petunia too vain Thats what Mamma said I mustnt be
when I had my new coat the one with the fur you know

She trotted off Jed busied himself with the chowder A few
minutes later a voice behind him said Hi there He turned to
see a broadshouldered stranger evidently a carpenter or workman
of some sort standing at the top of the sand dune and looking down
at him with marked interest

Hi there repeated the stranger

Jed nodded his attention was centered on the chowder How dye
do he observed politely Nice day aint it    Hum   
About five minutes more

The workman strode down the bank

Say he demanded have you seen anything of a plan

Eh    Hum    Two plates and two spoons    and two
tumblers   

Hey Wake up Have you seen anything of a plan I ask you

Eh    A plan    No I guess not    No I aint   
What is it

What IS it How do you know you aint seen it if you dont know
what it is

Eh    I dont I guess likely

Say youre a queer duck it strikes me What are you up to
What are you doin here anyway

Jed took the cover from the kettle and stirred the fragrant
bubbling mass with a longhandled spoon

About done he mused slowly Just    about    done
Give her two minutes more for luck and then   

But his visitor was becoming impatient Are you deaf or are you
tryin to get my goat he demanded Because if you are youre
pretty close to doin it Ill tell you that You answer when I
speak to you understand What are you doin here

His tone was so loud and emphatic that even Mr Winslow could not
help but hear and understand He looked up vaguely troubled

II hope youll excuse me Mister he stammered Im afraid I
havent been payin attention the way Id ought to You see Im
makin a chowder here and its just about got to the place where
you cant

Look here you began his questioner but he was interrupted in
his turn Over the edge of the bank came a young man in the khaki
uniform of the United States Army He was an officer a second
lieutenant and a very young and very new second lieutenant at
that His face was white and he seemed much agitated

Whats the matter here he demanded Then seeing Jed for the
first time he asked Who is this man and what is he doing here

Thats just what I was askin him sir blustered the workman
I found him here with this fire goin and I asked him who he was
and what he was doin I asked him first if hed seen the plan

Had he broke in the young officer eagerly Then addressing
Jed he said Have you seen anything of the plan

Jed slowly shook his head I dont knows I know what you mean by
a plan he explained I aint been here very long I just My
soul and body

He snatched the kettle from the fire took off the cover sniffed
anxiously and then added with a sigh of relief Whew I declare
I thought I smelt it burnin Saved it just in time Whew

The lieutenant looked at Jed and then at the workman The latter
shook his head

Dont ask me sir he said Thats the way hes been actin
ever since I struck here Either hes batty or else hes
pretendin to be one or the other Look here Rube he roared at
the top of his lungs can the cheap talk and answer the
lieutenants questions or youll get into trouble Dye hear

Jed looked up at him Im pretty nigh sure I should hear if you
whispered a little louder he said gently

The young officer drew himself up Thats enough of this he
ordered A plan has been lost here on this reservation a
valuable plan a drawing ofwell a drawing that has to do with
the laying out of this camp and which might be of value to the
enemy if he could get it It was on my table in the office less
than an hour ago Now it is missing What we are asking you is
whether or not you have seen anything of it Have you

Jed shook his head I dont think I have he replied

You dont think Dont you know What is the matter with you
Is it impossible for you to answer yes or no to a question

Umwhy yes I callate tisto some questions

Well by George Youre fresh enough

Nownow if you please I wasnt intendin to be fresh I just

Well you are Who is this fellow How does he happen to be
here Does any one know

Jeds first interrogator the big workman being the only one
present beside the speaker and the object of the question took it
upon himself to answer

I dont know who he is he said And he wont tell why hes
here Looks mighty suspicious to me Shouldnt wonder if he was a
German spy Theyre all around everywheres so the papers say

This speech had a curious effect The stoop in the Winslow
shoulders disappeared Jeds tall form straightened When he
spoke it was in a tone even more quiet and deliberate than usual
but there could be no shadow of a doubt that he meant what he said

Excuse me Mister he drawled but theres one or two names that
just now I cant allow anybody to call me German is one and
spy is another And you put em both together I guess likely
you was only foolin wasnt you

The workman looked surprised Then he laughed Shall I call a
guard sir he asked addressing the lieutenant Better have him
searched I should say Nine chances to one hes got the plan in
his pocket

The officerhe was very younghesitated Jed who had not taken
his eyes from the face of the man who had called him a German spy
spoke again

You havent answered me yet he drawled You was only foolin
when you said that wasnt you

The lieutenant who may have felt that he had suddenly become a
negligible factor in the situation essayed to take command of it

Shut up he ordered addressing Winslow Then to the other
Yes call a guard Well see if we cant get a straight answer
from this fellow Hurry up

The workman turned to obey But to his surprise his path was
blocked by Jed who quietly stepped in front of him

I guess likely if you wasnt foolin youd better take back what
you called me said Jed

They looked at each other The workman was tall and strong but
Jed now that he was standing erect was a little taller His
hands which hung at his sides were big and his arms long And in
his mild blue eye there was a look of unshakable determination
The workman saw that look and stood still

Hurry up repeated the lieutenant

Just how the situation might have ended is uncertain How it did
end was in an unexpected manner From the rear of the trio from
the top of the sandy ridge separating the beach from the meadow a
new voice made itself heard

Well Rayburn whats the trouble it asked

The lieutenant turned briskly so too did Mr Winslow and his
visavis Standing at the top of the ridge was another officer
He was standing there looking down upon them and although he was
not smiling Jed somehow conceived the idea that he was much amused
about something Now he descended the ridge and walked toward the
group by the fire

Well Rayburn what is it he asked again

The lieutenant saluted

Whywhy Major Grover he stammered wethat is I found this
man here on the Government property andand he wont explain what
hes doing here II asked him if he had seen anything of the
plan and he wont answer I was just going to put him under arrest
asas a suspicious person when you came

Major Grover turned and inspected Jed and Jed for his part
inspected the major He saw a well setup man of perhaps thirty
five darkhaired browneyed and with a closely clipped mustache
above a pleasant mouth and a firm chin The inspection lasted a
minute or more Then the major said

So youre a suspicious character are you

Jeds hand moved across his chin in the gesture habitual with him

I never knew it afore he drawled A suspicious character is an
important one aint it IerIm flattered

Humph Well you realize it now I suppose

Callate Ill have to longs yourerchummie there says its
so

The expression of horror upon Lieutenant Rayburns face at hearing
himself referred to as chummie to his superior officer was worth
seeing

Oh I say sir he explained The major paid no attention

What were you and this man indicating the big carpenter
bristling up to each other for he inquired

Well this guy he began the workman Major Grover motioned him
to be quiet

I asked the other fellow he said Jed rubbed his chin once
more

He said I was a German spy he replied

Are you

No The answer was prompt enough and emphatic enough Major
Grover tugged at the corner of his mustache

Well II admit you dont look it he observed dryly Whats
your name and who are you

Jed told his name his place of residence and his business

Is there any one about here who knows you who could prove you
were who you say you are

Mr Winslow considered Yees he drawled Yees I guess so
Thoph Mullett and Bial Hardy and Georgie T Nickerson and
Squealer Wixon theyre all carpenterin over here and theyre from
Orham and know me Then theres Bluey Batcheldor and Emulous Baker
and GawpyI mean Freddie Gand

There there Thats quite sufficient thank you Do you know
any of those men he asked turning to the workman

Yes sir I guess I do

Very well Go up and bring two of them here not more than two
understand

Jeds accuser departed Major Grover resumed his catechizing

What were you doing here he asked

Eh Me Oh I was just picnicin as you might say along with a
little girl daughter of a neighbor of mine She wanted to see
where the soldiers was goin to fly so I borrowed Perez Ryders
power dory and we came over Twas gettin along dinner time and I
built a fire so as to cook    My soul with a gasp of
consternation I forgot all about that chowder And now its got
stone cold Yes sir dropping on his knees and removing the
cover of the kettle stone cold or next door to it Aint that a
shame

Lieutenant Rayburn snorted in disgust His superior officer
however merely smiled

Never mind the chowder just now he said So you came over here
for a picnic did you Little late for picnics isnt it

Yesyees drawled Jed tis kind of late but twas a nice
moderate day and Babbie she wanted to come so

Babbie Thats the little girl    Oh with a nod I
remember now I saw a man with a little girl wandering about among
the buildings a little while ago Was that you

Yees yes that was me    Tut tut tut Ill have to warm
this chowder all up again now Thats too bad

Voices from behind the ridge announced the coming of the carpenter
and the two identifiers The latter Mr Emulous Baker and Mr
Squealer Wixon were on the broad grin

Yup thats him announced Mr Wixon Hello Shavins Got you
took up for a German spy have they Thats a good one haw haw

Do you know him asked the major

Know him Mr Wixon guffawed again Known him all my life He
lives over to Orham Makes windmills and whirlagigs and such for
youngones to play with HE aint any spy His names Jed
Winslow but we always call him Shavins count of his whittlin
up so much good wood you understand Aint that so Shavins
Haw haw

Jed regarded Mr Wixon mournfully

Umhm he admitted I guess likely youre right Squealer

I bet you Theres only one Shavins in Orham

Jed sighed Theres considerble many squealers he drawled
some in sties and some runnin loose

Major Grover who had appeared to enjoy this dialogue interrupted
it now

That would seem to settle the spy question he said You may
go all three of you he added turning to the carpenters They
departed Jeds particular enemy muttering to himself and Mr Wixon
laughing uproariously The major once more addressed Jed

Where is the little girl you were with he asked

Eh Oh shes over yonder just round the pint sailin a
shingle boat I made her Shall I call her

No it isnt necessary Mr Winslow Im sorry to have put you to
all this trouble and to have cooled yourerchowder There is no
regulation against visitors to our reservation here just now
although there will be of course later on There is a rule
against building fires on the beach but you broke that in
ignorance Im sure The reason why you have been crossquestioned
today is a special one A construction plan has been lost as
Lieutenant Rayburn here informed you It was on his desk in the
office and it has disappeared It may have been stolen of course
or as both windows were open it may have blown away You are
sure you havent seen anything of it Havent seen any papers
blowing about

Im sure it didnt blow away sir put in the lieutenant Im
positive it was stolen You see

He did not finish his sentence The expression upon Jeds face
caused him to pause Mr Winslows mouth and eyes were opening
wider and wider

Sho muttered Jed Sho now    Taint possible that   
I snum if    Sho

Well what is it demanded both officers practically in concert

Jed did not reply Instead he turned his head put both hands to
his mouth and shouted Babbie through them at the top of his
lungs The third shout brought a faint Yes Uncle Jed Im
coming

What are you calling her for asked Lieutenant Rayburn
forgetting the presence of his superior officer in his anxious
impatience Jed did not answer He was kneeling beside his
jacket which he had thrown upon the sand when he landed and was
fumbling in the pockets Dear me dear me he was muttering
Im sartin they must be here I KNOW I put em here because   
OW

He was kneeling and holding the coat with one hand while he fumbled
in the pockets with the other Unconsciously he had leaned
backward until he sat upon his heels Now with an odd expression
of mingled pain and relief he reached into the hip pocket of his
trousers and produced a pair of spectacles He smiled his slow
fleeting smile

There he observed I found em my waybackwards Anybody else
would have found em by looking for em I lost em lookin for em
and found em by sittin on em    Oh here you are Babbie
Sakes alive youre sort of dampish

She was all of that She had come running in answer to his call
and had the shingle boat hugged close to her The water from it
had trickled down the front of her dress Her shoes and stockings
were splashed with wet sand

Is dinner ready Uncle Jed she asked eagerly Then becoming
aware that the two strange gentlemen standing by the fire were
really and truly officer ones she looked wideeyed up at them
and uttered an involuntary Oh

Babbie said Jed let me see that boat of yours a minute will
you

Babbie obediently handed it over Jed inspected it through his
spectacles Then he pulled the paper sail from the sharpened
stickthe mastunfolded it looked at it and then extended it at
arms length toward Major Grover

Thats your plan thing aint it he asked calmly

Both officers reached for the paper but the younger remembering
in time drew back The other took it gave it a quick glance and
then turned again to Mr Winslow

Where did you get this he asked crisply

Jed shook his head

She gave it to me this little girl here he explained She
wanted a sail for that shingle craft I whittled out for her
Course if Id had on my specs I presume likely Id have noticed
that twas an out of the common sort of paper butI was wearin
em in my pants pocket just then

Where did you get it demanded Rayburn addressing Barbara The
child looked frightened Major Grover smiled reassuringly at her
and she stammered a rather faint reply

I found it blowing around up on the little hill there she said
pointing It was blowing real hard and I had to run to catch it
before it got to the edge of the water ImIIm sorry I gave
it to Uncle Jed for a sail I didnt knowandand he didnt
either she added loyally

Thats all right my dear Of course you didnt know Well
Rayburn turning to the lieutenant theres your plan You see
it did blow away after all I think you owe this young lady
thanks that it is not out in midchannel by this time Take it
back to the office and see if the holes in it have spoiled its
usefulness to any extent

The lieutenant very red in the face departed bearing his
precious plan Jed heaved a sigh of relief

There he exclaimed now I presume likely I can attend to my
chowder

The important things of life eh queried Major Grover

Umhm I dont knows theres anything much more important than
eatin Its a kind of expensive habit but an awful hard one to
swear off of    Hum    Speakin of important things was
that plan of yours very important MrI mean Major

Ratheryes

Sho    And I stuck it on a stick and set it afloat on a
shingle I callate if Sam Hunniwell knew of that hed say twas
characteristic    Hum    Sho    I read once about a
feller that found where the great seal of England was hid and he
used it to crack nuts with I guess likely that feller must have
been my great great great granddad

Major Grover looked surprised

Ive read that story he said but I cant remember where

Jed was stirring his chowder Eh he said absently Where
Oh twas intheerPrince and the Pauper you know Mark
Twain wrote it

Thats so I remember now So youve read The Prince and the
Pauper

Umhm Read about everything Mark Twain ever wrote I shouldnt
wonder

Do you read a good deal

Some    There Now well call that chowder done for the
second time I guess Set down and pass your plate Babbie
Youll set down and have a bite with us wont you MrMajorI
snum Ive forgot your name You mustnt mind I forget my own
sometimes

Grover I am a major in the Engineers stationed here for the
present to look after this construction work No thank you I
should like to stay but I must go back to my office

Dear dear Thats too bad Babbie and I would like firstrate
to have you stay Wouldnt we Babbie

Barbara nodded

Yes sir she said And the chowder will be awfly good Uncle
Jeds chowders always are

Im sure of it Major Grovers look of surprise was more evident
than ever as he gazed first at Barbara and then at Mr Winslow
His next question was addressed to the latter

So you are this young ladys uncle he inquired It was Barbara
who answered

Not my really uncle she announced Hes just my makebelieve
uncle He says hes my stepuncle cause he comes to our back
steps so much But hes almost better than a real uncle she
declared emphatically

The major laughed heartily and said he was sure of it He seemed
to find the pair hugely entertaining

Well goodby he said I hope you and your uncle will visit us
again soon And I hope next time no one will take him for a spy

Jed looked mournfully at the fire Ive been took for a fool
often enough he observed but a spy is a considerble worse
guess

Grover looked at him Im not so sure he said I imagine both
guesses would be equally bad Well goodby Dont forget to come
again

Thank you thank you And when youre over to Orham drop in some
day and see Babbie and me Anybodythe constable or anybodywill
tell you where I live

Their visitor laughed thanked him and hurried away Said Barbara
between spoonfuls

Hes a real nice officer one isnt he Uncle Jed Petunia and I
like him

During the rest of the afternoon they walked along the beach
picked up shells inspected horsefoot crabs jelly fish and
sand collars and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it was
after four when they started for home The early October dusk
settled down as they entered the winding channel between the sand
islands and the stretches of beaches Barbara wrapped in an old
coat of Captain Perezs which smelling strongly of fish had been
found in a locker seemed to be thinking very hard and for a
wonder saying little At last she broke the silence

That Mr Major officer man was stonished when I called you Uncle
Jed she observed Why do you spose

Jed whistled a few bars and peered over the side at the seaweed
marking the border of the narrow shallow channel

I callate he drawled after a moment that he hadnt noticed
how much we look alike

It was Barbaras turn to be astonished

But we DONT look alike Uncle Jed she declared Not a single
bit

Jed nodded Noo he admitted I presume thats why he didnt
notice it

This explanation which other people might have found somewhat
unsatisfactory appeared to satisfy Miss Armstrong at any rate she
accepted it without comment There was another pause in the
conversation Then she said

I dont know after all as I ought to call you Uncle Jed Uncle
Jed

Eh Why not for the land sakes

Cause uncles make people cry in our family I heard Mamma crying
last night after she thought I was asleep And I know she was
crying about Uncle Charlie She cried when they took him away you
know and now she cries when hes coming home again She cried
awfly when they took him away

Oh she did eh

Yes He used to live with Mamma and me at our house in
Middleford Hes awful nice Uncle Charlie is and Petunia and I
were very fond of him And then they took him away and we havent
seen him since

Hes been sick maybe

Perhaps so But he must be well again now cause hes coming home
Mamma said so

Umhm Well I guess that was it Probably he had to go to the
the hospital or somewhere and your ma has been worried about him
Hes had an operation maybe Lots of folks have operations
nowadays its got to be the fashion seems so

The child reflected

Do they have to have policemen come to take you to the hospital
she asked

Eh    Policemen

Yes Twas two big policemen took Uncle Charlie away the first
time We were having supper Mamma and he and I and Nora went to
the door when the bell rang and the big policemen came and Uncle
Charlie went away with them And Mamma cried so And she wouldnt
tell me a bit about    Oh OH Ive told about the policemen
Mamma said I mustnt ever EVER tell anybody that Andand I did
I DID

Aghast at her own depravity she began to sob Jed tried to
comfort her and succeeded after a fashion at least she stopped
crying although she was silent most of the way home And Jed
himself was silent also He shared her feeling of guilt He felt
that he had been told something which neither he nor any outsider
should have heard and his sensitive spirit found little
consolation in the fact that the hearing of it had come through no
fault of his Besides he was not so sure that he had been
faultless He had permitted the childs disclosures to go on when
perhaps he should have stopped them By the time the Aramintas
nose slid up on the sloping beach at the foot of the bluff before
the Winslow place she held two consciencestricken culprits instead
of one

And if Ruth Armstrong slept but little that night as her daughter
said had been the case the night before she was not the only
wakeful person in that part of Orham She would have been
surprised if she had known that her eccentric neighbor and landlord
was also lying awake and that his thoughts were of her and her
trouble For Jed although he had heard but the barest fragment of
the story of Uncle Charlie a mere hint dropped from the lips of
a child who did not understand the meaning of what she said had
heard enough to make plain to him that the secret which the young
widow was hiding from the world was a secret involving sorrow and
heartbreak for herself and shame and disgrace for others The
details he did not know nor did he wish to know them he was
entirely devoid of that sort of curiosity Possession of the
little knowledge which had been given him or rather had been
thrust upon him and which Gabe Bearse would have considered a
gossip treasure trove a promise of greater treasures to be
diligently mined to Jed was a miserable culpable thing like the
custody of stolen property He felt wicked and mean as if he had
been caught peeping under a window shade


CHAPTER X


That night came a sudden shift in the weather and when morning
broke the sky was gray and overcast and the wind blew raw and
penetrating from the northeast Jed at work in his stock room
sorting a variegated shipment of mills and vanes which were to go
to a winter resort on the west coast of Florida was as he might
have expressed it down at the mouth He still felt the sense of
guilt of the night before but with it he felt a redoubled
realization of his own incompetence When he had surmised his
neighbor and tenant to be in trouble he had felt a strong desire to
help her now that surmise had changed to certainty his desire to
help was stronger than ever He pitied her from the bottom of his
heart she seemed so alone in the world and so young She needed a
sympathetic counselor and advisor But he could not advise or help
because neither he nor any one else in Orham was supposed to know
of her trouble and its nature Even if she knew that he knew
would she accept the counsel of Shavings Winslow Hardly No
sensible person would How the townsfolk would laugh if they knew
he had even so much as dreamed of offering it

He was too downcast even to sing one of his lugubrious hymns or to
whistle Instead he looked at the letter pinned on a beam beside
him and dragged from the various piles one halfdozen crow vanes
one halfdozen gull vanes one dozen mediumsized mills one dozen
small mills three sailors etc etc as set forth upon that
order One of the crows fell to the floor and he accidently
stepped upon it and snapped its head off He was gazing solemnly
down at the wreck when the door behind him opened and a strong
blast of damp cold wind blew in He turned and found that Mrs
Armstrong had opened the door She entered and closed it behind
her

Good morning she said

Jed was surprised to see her at such an early hour also just at
that time her sudden appearance was like a sort of miracle as if
the thoughts in his brain had taken shape had materialized For a
moment he could not regain presence of mind sufficient to return
her greeting Then noticing the broken vane on the floor she
exclaimed

Oh you have had an accident Isnt that too bad When did it
happen

He looked down at the decapitated crow and touched one of the
pieces with the toe of his boot

Just this minute he answered I stepped on it and away she
went Did a pretty neat clean job didnt I    Umhm   
I wonder if anybody stepped on MY head twould break like that
Probably not the wood in it is too green I callate

She smiled but she made no comment on this characteristic bit of
speculation Instead she asked Mr Winslow are you very busy
this morning Is your work too important to spare me just a few
minutes

Jed looked surprised he smiled his onesided smile

No maam he drawled Ive been pretty busy but twant about
anything important I presume likely he added there aint
anybody in Ostable County that can be so busy as I can be doin
nothin important

And you can spare a few minutes II want to talk to you very
much I wont be long really

He regarded her intently Then he walked toward the door leading
to the little workroom Come right in here maam he said
gravely adding after they had entered the other apartment Take
that chair Ill sit over here on the box

He pulled forward the box and turned to find her still standing

Do sit down he urged That chair aint very comfortable I
know Perhaps Id better get you another one from my sittinroom
in yonder

He was on his way to carry out the suggestion but she interrupted
him Oh no she said This one will be perfectly comfortable
Im sure only

Yes Is there somethin the matter with it

Not the matter with it exactly but it seems to beoccupied

Jed stepped forward and peered over the workbench at the chair
Its seat was piled high with small pasteboard boxes containing
hardwarescrews tacks and metal washerswhich he used in his mill
and vanemaking

Sho he exclaimed Hum Does seem to be taken as you say I
recollect now a lot of that stuff came in by express day before
yesterday afternoon and I piled it up there while I was unpackin
it Here apparently addressing the hardware you get out of
that That seats reserved

He stretched a long arm over the workbench seized the chair by the
back and tipped it forward The pasteboard boxes went to the floor
in a clattering rush One containing washers broke open and the
little metal rings rolled everywhere Mr Winslow did not seem to
mind

There he exclaimed with evident satisfaction sit right down
maam

The lady sat as requested her feet amid the hardware boxes and her
hands upon the bench before her She was evidently very nervous
for her fingers gripped each other tightly And when she next
spoke she did not look at her companion

Mr Winslow she began II believethat is Babbie tells me
thatthat last evening when you and she were on your way back
here in the boat she said somethingshe told you something
concerning ourmyfamily affairs whichwhich

She faltered seeming to find it hard to continue Jed did not
wait He was by this time at least as nervous as she was and
considerably more distressed and embarrassed He rose from the box
and extended a protesting hand

Now now maam he begged Now Mrs Armstrong pleaseplease
dont say any more It aint necessary honest it aint She
shethat child she didnt tell me much of anything anyhow and she
didnt mean to tell that And if you knew how ashamed andand
mean Ive felt ever since to think I let myself hear that much I
hopeI do hope you dont think I tried to get her to tell me
anything I do hope you dont think that

His agitation was so acute and so obvious that she looked at him in
wonder for a moment Then she hastened to reassure him

Dont distress yourself Mr Winslow she said smiling sadly
I havent known you very long but I have already learned enough
about you to know that you are an honorable man If I did not know
that I shouldnt be here now It is true that I did not mean for
you or any one here in Orham to learn of myof our trouble and if
Babbie had not told you so much I probably should never have spoken
to you about it The poor childs conscience troubled her so last
evening that she came crying to me and confessed and it is because
I gathered from her that she had told enough to make you at least
guess the truth that I am here now I prefer that you should hear
the story just as it is from me rather than imagine something
which might be worse Dont you see

Jed saw but he was still very much perturbed

Now now Mrs Armstrong he begged dont tell me anything
please dont I laid awake about all night thinkin what Id ought
to do whether Id ought to tell you what Babbie said or just not
trouble you at all and try to forget I ever heard it Thats what
I decided finally to forget it and I willI vow and declare I
will Dont you tell me anything and let me forget this Now
please

But she shook her head Things like that are not so easily
forgotten she said even when one tries as hard to forget as I
am sure you would Mr Winslow No I want to tell you I really
do Please dont say any more Let me go on    Oh with a
sudden burst of feeling cant you see that I must talk with
SOMEONEI MUST

Her clasped fingers tightened and the tears sprang to her eyes
Poor Jeds distress was greater than ever

Nownow Mrs Armstrong he stammered all I meant to say was
that you mustnt feel youve got to tell me Course if you want
to thats different altogether What Im tryin to say he
added with a desperate attempt to make his meaning perfectly
clear is not to pay any attention to ME at all but do just what
YOU want to thats all

Even on the verge of tears as she was she could not forbear
smiling a little at this proclamation of complete selfeffacement
I fear I must pay some attention to you she said if I am to
confide in you andand perhaps ask your help your advice
afterwards I have reached a point when I must ask some ones
advice I have thought myself into a maze and I dont know what to
doI dont know WHAT to do I have no near relatives no friends
here in Orham

Jed held up a protesting hand

Excuse me Mrs Armstrong he stammered I dont know as you
recollect probably it might not have meant as much to you as it
did to me but a spell ago you said somethin about countin me as
a friend

I know I did And I meant it You have been very kind and
Barbara is so fond of you    Well perhaps you can advise me
at least you can suggestororhelp me to think Will you

Jed passed his hand across his chin It was obvious that her
asking his counsel was simply a last resort a desperate forlorn
hope She had no real confidence in his ability to help He would
have been the last to blame her for this her estimate of his
capabilities was like his own that was all

Weell he observed slowly as to givin my advice when a
mans asked to give away somethin thats worth nothin the least
he can do is say yes and try to look generous I callate If I
can advise you any why Ill feel proud of course

Thank you Mr Winslow for the past two years or more I have
been in great trouble I have a brotherbut you knew that Babbie
told you

Umhm The one she calls Uncle Charlie

Yes He ishe is serving his sentence in the Connecticut State
Prison

Jed leaned back upon the box His head struck smartly against the
edge of the bandsaw bench but he did not seem to be aware of the
fact

My Lord above he gasped

Yes it is true Surely you must have guessed something of that
sort after Babbies story of the policemen

IIwell I did sort ofof presume likely he must have got into
some sort ofof difficulty but I never thought twas bad as
that    Dear me    Dear me

My brother is younger than I he is scarcely twentythree years
old He and I are orphans Our home was in Wisconsin Father was
killed in a railway accident and Mother and my brother Charles and
I were left with very little money We were in a university town
and Mother took a few students as lodgers Doctor Armstrong was
one I met him there and before he left the medical college we
were engaged to be married Charlie was only a boy then of
course Mother died three years later Meanwhile SeymourDoctor
Armstronghad located in Middleford Connecticut and was
practicing medicine there He came on we were married and I
returned to Middleford with him We had been married but a few
years when he diedof pneumonia That was the year after Babbie
was born Charles remained in Wisconsin boarding with a cousin of
Mothers and after he graduated from high school entered one of
the banks in the town He was very successful there and the bank
people liked him After Seymourmy husbanddied he came East to
see me at Middleford One of Doctor Armstrongs patients a bond
broker in New Haven took a fancy to him or we thought he did and
offered him a position He accepted gave up his place at the bank
in Wisconsin and took charge of this mans Middleford office
making his home with Babbie and me He was young too young I
think now to have such a responsible position but every one said
he had a remarkably keen business mind and that his future was
certain to be brilliant And then

She paused It was evident that the hard part of her story was
coming After a moment she went on

Charlie was popular with the young people there in Middleford He
was always a favorite at home at school everywhere Mother
idolized him while she lived so did I so did Babbie He was fond
of society and the set he was friendly with was made up for the
most part of older men with much more money than he He was
proud he would not accept favors without repaying them he liked a
good time perhaps he was a little fast not dissipatedI should
have known if he were thatbutcarelessand what you men call a
good fellow At any rate he

Again she paused Jed sitting on the box clasping his knee
between his hands waited anxiously for her to continue

Of course you can guess what happened she said sadly after a
moment It was the old story that is all Charlie was living
beyond his means got into debt and speculated in stocks hoping to
make money enough to pay those debts The stocks went down and
andwell he took money belonging to his employer to protect his
purchases

She waited perhaps expecting her companion to make some comment
He did not and again she spoke

I know he meant only to borrow it she declared I KNOW it He
isnt bad Mr Winslow I know him better than any one and he ISNT
bad If he had only come to me when he got into the trouble
If he had only confided in me But he was proud andand he
didnt    Well I wont tell you how hishis fault was
discovered it would take a long time and it isnt worth while
They arrested him he was tried andand sent to prison for two
years

For the first time since she began her story Jed uttered a word

Sho he exclaimed Sho sho Dear me The poor young feller

She looked up at him quickly Thank you she said gratefully
Yes he was sent to prison He was calm and resigned and very
brave about it but to me it was a dreadful shock You see he had
taken so little money not much over two thousand dollars We
could have borrowed it Im sure he and I could have worked out
the debt together We could have done it I would have worked at
anything no matter how hard rather than have my brother branded
all his life with the disgrace of having been in prison But the
man for whom he had worked was furiously angry at what he called
Charlies ingratitude he would teach the young thief a lesson he
said Our lawyer went to him I went to him and begged him not to
press the case Of course Charlie didnt know of my going he
never would have permitted it if he had But I went and begged and
pleaded It did no good Why even the judge at the trial when
he charged the jury spoke of the defendants youth and previous
good character   

She covered her eyes with her hand Poor Jeds face was a picture
of distress

Nownow Mrs Armstrong he urged dont please dont II
wouldnt tell me any more about it if I was you Of course Im
Im proud to think you believed I was worth while tellin it to and
all that butyou mustnt Youll make yourself sick you know
Just dont tell any more please

She took her hand away and looked at him bravely

There isnt any more to tell she said I have told you this
because I realized that Barbara had told you enough to make you
imagine everything that was bad concerning my brother And he is
not bad Mr Winslow He did a wrong thing but I knowI KNOW he
did not mean deliberately to steal If that man he worked for had
beenif he had been But there he was what he was He said
thieves should be punished and if they were punished when they
were young so much the better because it might be a warning and
keep them honest as they grew older He told me that Mr Winslow
when I pleaded with him not to make Charles disgrace public and
not to wreck the boys life That was what he told me then And
they say she added bitterly that he prides himself upon being
a staunch supporter of the church

Jed let go of his knee with one hand in order to rub his chin

I have queer notions I callate he drawled If they wasnt
queer they wouldnt be mine I suppose If I waseras you might
say first mate of all creation Id put some church folks in jail
and a good many jail folks in church Seemss if the swap would be
a help to both sides    II hope you dont think Imer
unfeelin jokin when youre in such worry and trouble he
added anxiously I didnt mean it

His anxiety was wasted She had heard neither his first remark nor
the apology for it Her thoughts had been far from the windmill
shop and its proprietor Now apparently awakening to present
realities she rose and turned toward the door

That was all she said wearily You know the whole truth now
Mr Winslow Of course you will not speak of it to any one else
Then noticing the hurt look upon his face she added Forgive me
I know you will not If I had not known it I should not have
confided in you Thank you for listening so patiently

She was going but he touched her arm

Excuse me Mrs Armstrong he faltered butbut wasnt there
somethin else Somethin you wanted to ask my advice aboutor
orsomethin

She smiled faintly Yes there was she admitted But I dont
know that it is worth while troubling you after all It is not
likely that you can help me I dont see how any one can

Probably youre right II aint liable to be much help to
anybody But Im awful willin to try And sometimes you know
sometimes surprisin things happen Twas aa mouse or a ground
mole wasnt it that helped the lion in the story book out of the
scrape    Not that I dont look more like aergiraffe than
I do like a mouse he added

Mrs Armstrong turned and looked at him once more Youre very
kind she said And I know you mean what you say    Why
yes Ill tell you the rest Perhaps with the slight smile you
CAN advise me Mr Winslow You seewell you see my brother
will be freed very shortly I have received word that he is to be
pardoned his sentence is to be shortened because of what they call
his good conduct He will be freeand then What shall he do
then What shall we all do That is my problem

She went on to explain This was the situation Her own income
was barely sufficient for Barbara and herself to live in the
frugal way they were living in a country town like Orham That
was why she had decided to remain there No one in the village
knew her story or the story of her brothers disgrace But now
almost any day her brother might be discharged from prison He
would be without employment and without a home She would so
gladly offer him a home with herthey could manage to live to
exist in some way she saidbut she knew he would not be content
to have her support him There was no chance of employment in
Orham he would therefore be forced to go elsewhere to go
wandering about looking for work And that she could not bear to
think of

You see she said II feel as if I were the only helper and
wellguardian the poor boy has I can imagine smiling wanly
how he would scorn the idea of his needing a guardian but I feel
as if it were my duty to be with him to stand by him when every
one else has deserted him Besides after an instants
hesitation I feelI suppose it is unreasonable but I feel as if
I had neglected my duty before as if perhaps I had not watched him
as carefully as I should or encouraged him to confide in me I
cant help feeling that perhaps if I had been more careful in this
way the dreadful thing might not have happened    Oh she
added turning away again I dont know why I am telling all these
things to you Im sure They cant interest you much and the
telling isnt likely to profit either of us greatly But I am so
alone and I have brooded over my troubles so much As I said I
have felt as if I must talk with some one But theregood
morning Mr Winslow

Just a minute please Mrs Armstrong just a minute Hasnt your
brother got any friends in Middleford who could help him get some
worka jobyou know what I mean Seems as if he must have or
you must have

Oh we have I suppose We had some good friends there as well
as others whom we thought were friends Butbut I think we both
had rather die than go back there I am sure I should Think what
it would mean to both of us

Jed understood She might have been surprised to realize how
clearly he understood She was proud and it was plain to see that
she had been very proud of her brother And Middleford had been
her home where she and her husband had spent their few precious
years together where her child was born where after her brother
came she had watched his rise to success and the apparent
assurance of a brilliant future She had begun to be happy once
more Then came the crash and shame and disgrace instead of pride
and confidence Jeds imagination the imagination which was quite
beyond the comprehension of those who called him the town crank
grasped it allor at least all its essentials He nodded
slowly

I see he said Yes yes I see    Hum

Of course any one must see And to go away to some city or town
where we are not knownwhere could we go What should we live on
And yet we cant stay here there is nothing for Charles to do

Um    He was awhat did you say his trade was

He was a bond broker a kind of banker

Eh    A kind of banker    Sho Did he work in a bank

Why yes I told you he did in Wisconsin where he and I used to
live

Hum    Pretty smart at it too seems to me you said he was

Yes very capable indeed

I want to know    Hum    Sho

He muttered one or two more disjointed exclamations and then ceased
to speak altogether staring abstractedly at a crack in the floor
All at once he began to hum a hymn Mrs Armstrong whose nerves
were close to the breaking point lost patience

Good morning Mr Winslow she said and opened the door to the
outer shop This time Jed did not detain her Instead he stared
dreamily at the floor apparently quite unconscious of her or his
surroundings

Eh he drawled Oh yes good morningood mornin   
Hum   


 There is a fountain filled with blood
 Drawn from Emmanuels veins
 And sinners plunged de de de de
 De de di dew dum de


His visitor closed the door Jed still sat there gazing at vacancy
and droning dolefully


CHAPTER XI


For nearly an hour he sat there scarcely changing his position
and only varying his musical program by whistling hymns instead of
singing them Once hearing a step in the yard he looked through
the window and saw Gabriel Bearse walking toward the gate from the
direction of the shop door instead of in the opposite direction
Evidently he had at first intended to call and then had changed his
mind Mr Winslow was duly grateful to whoever or whatever had
inspired the change He had no desire to receive a visit from
Gab Bearse at this time least of all

Later on he heard another step and again glancing through the
window saw Seth Wingate the vegetable and fruit peddler walking
from the door to the gate just as Mr Bearse had done Apparently
Seth had changed his mind also Jed thought this rather odd but
again he was grateful He was thinking hard and was quite willing
not to be disturbed

But the disturbing came ten minutes after Mr Wingates departure
and came in the nature of a very distinct disturbance There was a
series of thunderous knocks on the front door that door was thrown
violently open and before the startled maker of mills could do
much more than rise to his feet the door to the workroom was
pulled open also Captain Hunniwells bulk filled the opening
Captain Sam was redfaced and seemed excited

Well by the gracious king he roared youre here anyhow
What else is the matter with you

Jed who after recognizing his visitor had seated himself once
more looked up and nodded

Hello Sam he observed Say I was just thinkin about you
Thats kind of funny aint it

Funny Just thinkin about me Well Ive been thinkin about
you I tell you that Have you been in this shop all the forenoon

Eh    Why yes    Sartin    Ive been right here

You HAVE Gracious king Then why in the Old Harry have you got
that sign nailed on your front door out here tellin all hands
youre out for the day and for em to ask for you up at Abijah
Thompsons

Jed looked much surprised His hand moved slowly across his chin

Sho he drawled Sho Has that sign been hangin there all
this forenoon

Dont ask me I guess it has from what Ive heard Anyhow its
there now And WHATS it there for Thats what I want to know

Jeds face was very solemn but there was a faint twinkle in his
eye That explains about Seth Wingate he mused Yes and Gab
Bearse too    Hum    The Lord was better to me than I
deserved They say He takes care of children and drunken men and
erthe critters that most folks think belong to my lodge   
Hum    To think I forgot to take that sign down Sho

Forgot to take it down What in everlastin blazes did you ever
put it up for

Jed explained why the placard had been prepared and affixed to the
door I only meant it for yesterday though he added Id
intended takin it down this mornin

Captain Sam put back his head and laughed until the shop echoed

Ho ho ho he roared And you mean to tell me that you put it
up there because you was goin cruisin to the aviation camp and
you didnt want callers disturbin Mrs Armstrong

His friend nodded Umhm he admitted I sent em to Bijes
because he was as far off as anybody I could think of Pretty good
idea wasnt it

The captain grinned Great he declared Fine Wonderful
You wait till Bije comes to tell you how fine twas Hes in bed
laid up with neuralgia and Emma J his wife says that every hour
or less yesterday there was somebody bangin at their door asking
about you Every time they banged she says that Bije his nerves
bein on edge the way they are would pretty nigh jump the quilts
up to the ceilin and himself along with em And his remarks got
more lit up every jump About five oclock when somebody came
poundin he let out a roar you could hear a mile Tell em
Shavins Winslows gone to the devil he bellowed and that I say
they can go there too And then Emma J opened the door and
twant anybody askin about you at all twas the Baptist minister
come callin I was drivin past there just now and Emma J came
out to tell me about it She wanted to know if youd gone clear
crazy instead of part way I told her I didnt know but Id make
it my business to find out Tut tut tut You are a wonder
Jed

Jed did not dispute the truth of this statement He looked
troubled however Sho he said Im sorry if I plagued Bijah
that way If Id known he was sick I wouldnt have done it I
never once thought so many folks as one every hour would want to
see me this time of year Dear me Im sorry about Bije Maybe
Id better go down and kind of explain it to him

Captain Sam chuckled I wouldnt he said If I was you Id
explain over the long distance telephone But anyhow I wouldnt
worry much I callate Emma J exaggerated affairs some
Probably if the truth was known youd find not more than four
folks came there lookin for you yesterday Dont worry Jed

Jed did not answer The word worry had reminded him of his other
visitor that morning He looked so serious that his friend
repeated his adjuration

Dont worry I tell you he said again Tisnt worth it

All right I wont    I wont    Sam I was thinkin
about you afore you came in You remember I told you that

I remember What have you got on your mind Any more money
kickin around this gloryhole that you want me to put to your
account

Eh    Oh yes I believe there is some somewheres Seems to
me I put about a hundred and ten dollars checks and bills and
such away day before yesterday for you to take when you came
Maybe Ill remember where I put it before you go But twant
about that I was thinkin Sam how is Barzilla Smalls boy Lute
gettin along in Gus Howes job at the bank

Captain Sam snorted disgust

Gettin along he repeated Hes gettin along the way a squid
swims and thats backwards And if you asked me Id say the
longer he stayed the further back hed get

Sho then he did turn out to be a leak instead of an able seaman
eh

A leak Gracious king Hes like a torpedo blowup under the
engineroom The bankll sink if he stays aboard another month I
do believe And yet he added with a shake of the head I dont
see but hell have to stay there aint another available candidate
for the job in sight I phoned up to Boston and some of our
friends are lookin around up there but so far they havent had
any success This war is makin young men scarce that is young
men that are good for much Pretty soon itll get so that a
healthy young feller who aint in uniform will feel about as much
out of place as a hog in a synagogue Yes sir Ho ho

He laughed in huge enjoyment of his own joke Jed stared dreamily
at the adjusting screw on the handsaw His hands clasped his knee
his foot was lifted from the floor and began to swing back and
forth

Well queried his friend what have you got on your mind Out
with it

Eh    On my mind

Yes When I see you begin to shut yourself together in the middle
like a jackknife and start swinging that number eleven of yours I
know youre thinkin hard about somethin or other What is it
this time

Um    well    er    Sam if you saw a chance to get a
real smart young feller in Lutes place in the bank youd take him
wouldnt you

Would I Would a cat eat lobster Only show him to me thats
all

Umhm    Now of course you know I wouldnt do anything to
hurt Lute Not for the world I wouldnt Its only if you ARE
goin to let him go

IF I am Either hell have to let go or the bank will one or
tother United we sink divided one of us may float thats the
way I look at it Lutell stay till we can locate somebody else to
take his job and no longer

Yaas    Umhm    Well I tell you Sam Dont you get
anybody else till you and I have another talk It may be possible
that I could find you just the sort of young man youre lookin
for

Eh YOU can find me one YOU can What are you givin me Jed
Who is the young man you

Jed gravely shook his head Noo he drawled I hate to
disappoint you Sam but it aint me Its anotherersmart
lively young feller He aint quite so old as I am theres a
little matter of twenty odd years between us I believe but
otherwise than that hes all right And he knows the bankin
trade so Im told

Gracious king Who is he Where is he

That I cant tell you just yet But maybe I can by and by

Tell me now

Noo No I just heard about him and it was told to me in secret
All I can say is dont get anybody to fill Lute Smalls place till
you and I have another talk

Captain Sam stared keenly into his friends face Jed bore the
scrutiny calmly in fact he didnt seem to be aware of it The
captain gave it up

All right he said No use tryin to pump you I know that
When you make up your mind to keep your mouth shut a feller
couldnt open it with a cold chisel I presume likely youll tell
in your own good time Now if youll scratch around and find those
checks and things you want me to deposit for you Ill take em and
be goin Im in a little bit of a hurry this mornin

Jed scratched around finally locating the checks and bills in
the coffee pot on the shelf in his little kitchen

There he exclaimed with satisfaction I knew I put em
somewheres where theyd be safe and where I couldnt forget em

Where you couldnt forget em Why you did forget em didnt
you

Um    yes    I callate I did this mornin but thats
because I didnt make any coffee for breakfast If Id made coffee
same as I usually do Id have found em

Why didnt you make coffee this mornin

Jeds eye twinkled

Weell he drawled to be honest with you Sam twas because
I couldnt find the coffee pot After I took it down to put this
money in it I put it back on a different shelf I just found it
now by accident

As the captain was leaving Jed asked one more question Sam he
asked about this bank job now If you had a chance to get a
bright smart young man with experience in bank work youd hire
him wouldnt you

Captain Hunniwells answer was emphatic

You bet I would he declared If I liked his looks and his
references were good Id hire him in two minutes And salary any
reasonable salary wouldnt part us either    Eh What makes
you look like that

For Jeds expression had changed his hand moved across his chin

Eherreferences he repeated

Why why of course Id want references from the folks hed
worked for statin that he was honest and capable and all that
With those Id hire him in two minutes as I said You fetch him
along and see So long Jed See you later

He hustled out stopping to tear from the outer door the placard
directing callers to call at Abijah Thompsons Jed returned to
his box and sat down once more to ponder In his innocence it had
not occurred to him that references would be required

That evening about nine he crossed the yard and knocked at the
back door of the little house Mrs Armstrong answered the knock
Barbara of course was in bed and asleep Ruth was surprised to
see her landlord at that for him late hour Also remembering
the unceremonious way in which he had permitted her to depart at
the end of their interview that forenoon she was not as cordial as
usual She had made him her confidant why she scarcely knew
then after expressing great interest and sympathy he had suddenly
seemed to lose interest in the whole matter She was acquainted
with his eccentricities and fits of absentmindedness but
nevertheless she had been hurt and offended She told herself that
she should have expected nothing more from Shavings Winslow the
person about whom twothirds of Orham joked and told stories but
the fact remained that she was disappointed And she was angry
not so much with him perhaps as with herself WHY had she been so
foolish as to tell any one of their humiliation

So when Jed appeared at the back door she received him rather
coldly He was quite conscious of the change in temperature but
he made no comment and offered no explanation Instead he told his
story the story of his interview with Captain Hunniwell As he
told it her face showed at first interest then hope and at the
last radiant excitement She clasped her hands and leaned toward
him her eyes shining

Oh Mr Winslow she cried breathlessly do you mean it Do
you really believe Captain Hunniwell will give my brother a
position in his bank

Jed nodded slowly Yes he said I think likely he might
Course twouldnt be any great of a place not at firstnor ever
I callate so far as that goes Taint a very big bank and wages
aint

But she interrupted But that doesnt make any difference she
cried Dont you see it doesnt The salary and all that wont
countnow It will be a start for Charles an opportunity for him
to feel that he is a man again doing a mans work an honest mans
work And he will be here where I can be with him where we can be
together where it wont be so hard for us to be poor and where
there will be no one who knows us who knows our story Oh Mr
Winslow is it really true If it is howhow can we ever thank
you How can I ever show you how grateful I feel

Her cheeks were flushed her lips parted and joy shone in her eager
eyes Her voice broke a little as she uttered the words Jed
looked at her and then quickly looked away

IIdont talk so Mrs Armstrong he pleaded hastily It
it aint anything it aint really It just

Not anything Not anything to find my brother the opportunity he
and I have been praying for To give me the opportunity of having
him with me Isnt that anything It is everything Oh Mr
Winslow if you can do this for us

Shsh Sshh Now Mrs Armstrong please You mustnt say Im
doin it for you Im the one that just happened to think of it
thats all You could have done it just as well if youd thought
of it

Perhaps with a doubtful smile but I should never have thought
of it You did because you were thinking for mefor my brother
and me Andand I thought you didnt care

Eh    Didnt care

Yes When I left you at the shop this morning after our talk
You were soso odd You didnt speak or offer to advise me as I
had asked you to you didnt even say goodby You just sat there
and let me go And I didnt understand and

Jed put up a hand His face was a picture of distress

Dear dear dear he exclaimed Did I do that I dont
remember it but of course I did if you say so Now what on earth
possessed me to    Eh as the idea occurred to him Tell
me was I singin

Why yes you were That is you werewere

Makin a noise as if Id swallowed a hymn book and one of the
tunes was chokin me to death Umhm thats the way I sing And
I was singin when you left me eh That means I was thinkin
about somethin I told Babbie once and its the truth that
thinkin was a big job with me and when I did it I had to drop
everything else come up into the wind like a schooner you know
and just lay to and think    Oh I remember now You said
somethin about your brothers workin in a bank and that set me
thinkin that Sam must be needin somebody by this time in Lute
Smalls place

You didnt know he needed any one

Noo not exactly but I knew Lute and that amounted to the same
thing Mrs Armstrong I do hope youll forgive me forfor
singin andand all the rest of my foolish actions

Forgive you Will you forgive me for misjudging you

Land sakes dont talk that way But theres one thing I havent
said yet and you may not like it I guess you and your brotherll
have to go to Sam and tell him the whole story

Her expression changed The whole story she repeated Why
what do you mean Tell him that Charles has been inin prison
You dont mean THAT

Umhm gravely Im afraid I do It looks to me as if it was
the only way

But we cant Oh Mr Winslow we cant do that

I know twill be awful hard for you But when I talked to Sam
about my havin a possible candidate for the bank place the very
last thing he said was that hed be glad to see him providin his
references was all right I give you my word Id never thought of
references not till then

But if we tell himtell him everything we shall only make
matters worse shant we Of course he wont give him the position
then

Theres a chance he wont thats true But Sam Hunniwells a
fine feller there aint any better and he likes you andwell he
and I have been cruisin in company for a long spell Maybe hell
give your brother a chance to make good I hope he will

You only hope I thought you said you believed

Well I do but of course it aint sartin I wish twas

She was silent Jed watching her saw the last traces of
happiness and elation fade from her face and disappointment and
discouragement come back to take their places He pitied her and
he yearned to help her At last he could stand it no longer

Now Mrs Armstrong he pleaded of course

She interrupted

No she said as if coming to a final decision and speaking that
decision aloud No I cant do it

Eh Cant dowhat

I cant have Captain Hunniwell know of our trouble I came here
to Orham where no one knew me to avoid that very thing At home
there in Middleford I felt as if every person I met was staring at
me and saying Her brother is in prison I was afraid to have
Babbie play with the other children I wasbut there I wont
talk about it I cant And I cannot have it begin again here
Ill go away first We will all go away out West anywhere
anywhere where we can becleanand like other people

Jed was conscious of a cold sensation like the touch of an icicle
up and down his spine Going away She and Babbie going away In
his minds eye he saw a vision of the little house closed once more
and shuttered tight as it used to be He gasped

Now now Mrs Armstrong he faltered Dont talk about goin
away Itit isnt needful for you to do anything like that Of
course it aint Youyou mustnt Iwe cant spare you

She drew a long breath I would go to the other end of the
world she said rather than tell Captain Hunniwell the truth
about my brother I told you because Babbie had told you so much
already    Oh turning swiftly toward him YOU wont tell
Captain Hunniwell will you

Before he could answer she stretched out her hand Oh please
forgive me she cried I am not myself I am almost crazy I
think And when you first told me about the position in the bank I
was so happy Oh Mr Winslow isnt there SOME way by which
Charles could have that chance Couldntcouldnt he get it and
and work there forfor a year perhaps until they all saw what a
splendid fellow he was and THEN tell themif it seemed necessary
They would know him then and like him they couldnt help it
every one likes him

She brushed the tears from her eyes Poor Jed miserable and most
unreasonably consciencestricken writhed in his chair II
dont know he faltered I declare I dont see how Erer
Out in that bank where he used to work that Wisconsin bank he
you said he did firstrate there

She started Yes yes she cried eagerly Oh he was splendid
there And the man who was the head of that bank when Charles was
there is an old friend of ours of the family he has retired now
but he would help us if he could I know I believe    I wonder
if    Mr Winslow I cant tell any one in Orham of our disgrace
and I cant bear to give up that opportunity for my brother Will
you leave it to me for a little while Will you let me think it
over

Of course Jed said he would and went back to his little room over
the shop As he was leaving she put out her hand and said with
impulsive earnestness

Thank you Mr Winslow Whatever comes of this or if nothing
comes of it I can never thank you enough for your great kindness

Jed gingerly shook the extended hand and fled his face scarlet

During the following week although he saw his neighbors each day
and several times a day Mrs Armstrong did not mention her brother
or the chance of his employment in the Orham bank Jed very much
surprised at her silence was tempted to ask what her decision was
or even if she had arrived at one On one occasion he threw out a
broad hint but the hint was not taken instead the lady changed
the subject in fact it seemed to him that she made it a point of
avoiding that subject and was anxious that he should avoid it
also He was sure she had not abandoned the idea which at first
had so excited her interest and raised her hopes She seemed to
him to be still under a strong nervous strain to speak and act as
if under repressed excitement but she had asked him to leave the
affair to her to let her think it over so of course he could do
or say nothing until she had spoken But he wondered and
speculated a good deal and was vaguely troubled When Captain Sam
Hunniwell called he did not again refer to his possible candidate
for the position now held by Luther Small And singularly enough
the captain himself did not mention the subject

But one morning almost two weeks after Jeds discussion with the
young widow she and Captain Hunniwell came into the windmill shop
together Mrs Armstrongs air of excitement was very much in
evidence Her cheeks were red her eyes sparkled her manner
animated Her landlord had never seen her look so young or for
that matter so happy

Captain Sam began the conversation He too seemed to be in high
good humor

Well Jedidah Wilfred Shavins he observed facetiously what
do you suppose Ive got up my sleeve this mornin

Jed laid down the chisel he was sharpening

Your arms I presume likely he drawled

Yes Ive got my arms and theres a fist at the end of each one of
em Any moreerflippity answers like that one and youre
liable to think youre struck by lightnin This lady and I have
got news for you Do you know what tis

Jed looked at Mrs Armstrong and then at the speaker

Noo he said slowly

Well to begin with its this Lute Small is leavin the Orham
National a week from next Saturday by a vote of eight to one The
directors and the cashier and I are the eight and hes the one
Ho ho And who do you suppose comes aboard on the next Monday
mornin to take over what Lute has left of the job Eh Who
Why your own candidate thats who

Jed started Again he looked at Mrs Armstrong and as if in
answer to that look she spoke

Yes Mr Winslow she said quickly my brother is coming to
Orham and Captain Hunniwell has given him the position It is
really you to whom he owes it all You thought of it and spoke to
the captain and to me

But why in time demanded Captain Sam didnt you tell me right
out that twas Mrs Armstrongs brother you had in mind Gracious
king if Id known that Id have had Lute out a fortnit sooner

Jed made no reply to this He was still staring at the lady

Butbut he faltered did youhave you

He stopped in the middle of a word Ruth was standing behind the
captain and he saw the frightened look in her eyes and the swift
movement of her finger to her lips

Oh yes she said II have I told Captain Hunniwell of
Charlies experience in the bank in Wisconsin He has written
there and the answer is quite satisfactory or so he seems to
think

Couldnt be better declared Captain Sam Heres the letter
from the man that used to be the bank president out there Read
it Jed if you want to

Jed took the letter and with a hand which shook a little adjusted
his glasses and read It was merely a note brief and to the
point It stated simply that while Charles Phillips had been in
the employ of their institution as messenger bookkeeper and
assistant teller he had been found honest competent ambitious
and thoroughly satisfactory

And what more do I want than that demanded the captain
Anybody who can climb up that way afore hes twentyfive will do
well enough for yours truly Course he and I havent met yet but
his sister and Ive met and Im not worryin but what Ill like
the rest of the family Besides he added with a combination
laugh and groan its a case of desperation with us up at the
bank Weve got to have somebody to plug that leak you was talkin
about Jed and weve got to have em immediate right off quick
at once or a little sooner Its a providence your brother is to
us Mrs Armstrong he declared a special providence and no
mistake

He hurried off a moment later affirming that he was late at the
bank already

Course the cashiers there and the rest of the help he added
but it takes all hands and the cat to keep Lute from puttin the
kindlin in the safe and lightin up the stove with ten dollar
bills So long

After he had gone Jed turned to his remaining visitor His voice
shook a little as he spoke

You havent told him he faltered reproachfully Youyou
havent told him

She shook her head I couldntI couldnt she declared
DONT look at me like that Please dont I know it is wrong I
feel like a criminal I feel wicked But defiantly I should
feel more wicked if I had told him and my brother had lost the only
opportunity that might have come to him He WILL make good Mr
Winslow I KNOW he will He will make them respect him and like
him They cant help it See she cried her excitement and
agitation growing see how Mr Reed the bank president there at
home the one who wrote that letter see what he did for Charles
He knows too he knows the whole story II wrote to him I
wrote that very night when you told me Mr Winslow I explained
everything I begged himhe is an old old friend of our family
to do this thing for our sakes You see it wasnt asking him to
lie or to do anything wrong It was just that he tell of Charles
and his ability and character as he knew them It wasnt wrong
was it

Jed did not answer

If it was she declared I cant help it I would do it again
for the same reasonto save him and his future to save us all I
cant help what you think of me It doesnt matter All that does
matter is that you keep silent and let my brother have his chance

Jed leaning forward in his chair by the workbench put his hand to
his forehead

Dontdont talk so Mrs Armstrong he begged You knowyou
know I dont think anything youve done is wrong I aint got the
right to think any such thing as that And as for keepin still
why II did hope you wouldnt feel twas necessary to ask that

I dontI dont I know you and I trust you You are the only
person in Orham whom I have trusted You know that

Why yeswhy yes I do know it andand Im ever so much obliged
to you More obliged than I can tell you I am Nownow would
you mind tellin me just one thing more About this Mr Whats
hisname out West in the bank therethis Mr Reeddid he write
you he thought twas all right for him to send Sam thethe kind of
letter he did send him the one givin your brother such a good
reference

The color rose in her face and she hesitated before replying

No she confessed after a moment He did not write me that he
thought it right to give Captain Hunniwell such a reference In
fact he wrote that he thought it all wrong deceitful bordering on
the dishonest He much preferred having Charles go to the captain
and tell the whole truth On the other hand however he said he
realized that that might mean the end of the opportunity here and
perhaps public scandal and gossip by which we all might suffer
And he said he had absolute confidence that Charles was not a
criminal by intent and he felt quite sure that he would never go
wrong again If he were still in active business he said he
should not hesitate to employ him Therefore although he still
believed the other course safer and better he would if Captain
Hunniwell wrote answer as I had asked And he did answer in that
way So you see she cried eagerly HE believes in Charles
just as I do And just as you will when you know Mr Winslow
Oh WONT you try to believe now

A harderhearted man than Jed Winslow would have found it difficult
to refuse such a plea made in such a way by such a woman And
Jeds heart was anything but hard

Now now Mrs Armstrong he stammered you dont have to ask me
that Course I believe in the poor young chap Andand I guess
likely everythings goin to come out all right That Mr Whats
hisnameerWrightno ReedI got read and write mixed up I
guesshes a business man and hed ought to know about such things
bettern I do I dont doubt itll come out fine and we wont
worry any more about it

And we will still be friends You know Mr Winslow you are the
only real friend I have in Orham And you have been so loyal

Jed flushed with pleasure

II told you once he said that my friends generally called me
Jed

She laughed Very well Ill call you Jed she said But turn
about is fair play and you must call me Ruth Will you Oh
theres Babbie calling me Thank you again for Charles sake and
my own Good morningJed

Erergood mornin Mrs Armstrong

What

ErI mean Mrs Ruth

The most of that forenoon that is the hour or so remaining was
spent by Mr Winslow in sitting by the workbench and idly
scratching upon a board with the point of the chisel Sometimes
his scratches were meaningless sometimes they spelled a name a
name which he seemed to enjoy spelling But at intervals during
that day and on other days which followed he was conscious of an
uneasy feeling a feeling almost of guilt coupled with a dim
foreboding

Ruth Armstrong had called him a friend and loyal But had he been
as loyal to an older friend a friend he had known all his life
Had he been loyal to Captain Sam Hunniwell

That was the feeling of guilt The foreboding was not as definite
but it was always with him he could not shake it off All his
life he had dealt truthfully with the world had not lied or
evaded or compromised Now he had permitted himself to become a
silent partner in such a compromise And some day somehow
trouble was coming because of it


CHAPTER XII


Before the end of another week Charles Phillips came to Orham It
was Ruth who told Jed the news She came into the windmill shop
and standing beside the bench where he was at work she said Mr
Winslow I have something to tell you

Jed put down the pencil and sheet of paper upon which he had been
drawing new patterns for the gull vane which was to move its
wings when the wind blew This great invention had not progressed
very far toward practical perfection Its inventor had been busy
with other things and had of late rather lost interest in it But
Barbaras interest had not flagged and to please her Jed had
promised to think a little more about it during the next day or so

But cant you make it flap its wings Uncle Jed the child had
asked

Jed rubbed his chin Weell he drawled I dont know I
thought I could but now I aint so sure I could make em whirl
round and round like a mill or a set of sailor paddles but to
make em flap is different Theyve got to be put on strong enough
so they wont flop off You see he added solemnly if they
kept floppin off they wouldnt keep flappin on Theres all the
difference in the world between a flap and flop

He was trying to reconcile that difference when Ruth entered the
shop He looked up at her absently Mr Winslow she began
again I

His reproachful look made her pause and smile slightly in spite of
herself

Im sorry she said Well thenJedI have something to tell
you My brother will be here tomorrow

Jed had been expecting to hear this very thing almost any day but
he was a little startled nevertheless

Sho he exclaimed You dont tell me

Yes He is coming on the evening train tomorrow I had word
from him this morning

Jeds hand moved to his chin Hum    he mused I guess
likely youll be pretty glad to see him

I shall be at least that with a little break in her voice You
can imagine what his coming will mean to me No I suppose you
cant imagine it no one can

Jed did not say whether he imagined it or not

IIm real glad for you Mrs Ruth he declared Mrs Ruth
was as near as he ever came to fulfilling their agreement
concerning names

Im sure you are And for my brothers sake and my own I am very
grateful to you Mr WinslowJed I meanyou have done so much
for us already will you do one thing more

Jeds answer was given with no trace of his customary hesitation
Yes he said

This is really for me perhaps more than for Charlesor at least
as much

Again there was no hesitation in the Winslow reply

That wont make it any harder he observed gravely

Thank you It is just this I have decided not to tell my brother
that I have told you of hishis trouble of his having beenwhere
he has been or anything about it He knows I have not told
Captain Hunniwell Im sure he will take it for granted that I have
told no one I think it will be so much easier for the poor boy if
he can come here to Orham and think that no one knows And no one
does know but you You understand dont you she added earnestly

He looked a little troubled but he nodded

Yes he said slowly I understand I callate

Im sure you do Of course if he should ask me pointblank if I
had told any one I should answer truthfully tell him that I had
told you and explain why I did it And some day I shall tell him
whether he asks or not But when he first comes here I want him to
beto bewell as nearly happy as is possible under the
circumstances I want him to meet the people here without the
feeling that they know he has beena convict any of them And
so unless he asks I shall not tell him that even you know and I
am sure you will understand and notnot

Not say anything when hes around that might let the cat out of
the bag Yes yes I see Well Ill be careful you can count on
me Mrs Ruth

She looked down into his homely earnest face I do she said
simply and went out of the room For several minutes after she
had gone Jed sat there gazing after her Then he sighed picked up
his pencil and turned again to the drawing of the gull

And the following evening young Phillips came Jed looking from
his shop window saw the depotwagon draw up at the gate Barbara
was the first to alight Philander Hardy came around to the back
of the vehicle and would have assisted her but she jumped down
without his assistance Then came Ruth and after her a slim
young fellow carrying a traveling bag It was dusk and Jed could
not see his face plainly but he fancied that he noticed a
resemblance to his sister in the way he walked and the carriage of
his head The two went into the little house together and Jed
returned to his lonely supper He was a trifle blue that evening
although he probably would not have confessed it Least of all
would he have confessed the reason which was that he was just a
little jealous He did not grudge his tenant her happiness in her
brothers return but he could not help feeling that from that time
on she would not be as intimate and confidential with him Jed
Winslow as she had been After this it would be to this brother
of hers that she would turn for help and advice Well of course
that was what she should do what any one of sense would do but
Jed was uncomfortable all the same Also because he was himself
he felt a sense of guilty remorse at being uncomfortable

The next morning he was presented to the new arrival It was
Barbara who made the presentation She came skipping into the
windmill shop leading the young man by the hand

Uncle Jed she said this is my Uncle Charlie Hes been away
and hes come back and hes going to work here always and live in
the bank No I mean hes going to work in the bank always and
live No I dont but you know what I do mean dont you Uncle
Jed

Charles Phillips smiled If he does he must be a mindreader
Babbie he said Then extending his hand he added Glad to
know you Mr Winslow Ive heard a lot about you from Babbie and
Sis

Jed might have replied that he had heard a lot about him also but
he did not Instead he said How dye do shook the proffered
hand and looked the speaker over What he saw impressed him
favorably Phillips was a goodlooking young fellow with a
pleasant smile a taking manner and a pair of dark eyes which
reminded Mr Winslow of his sisters It was easy to believe
Ruths statement that he had been a popular favorite among their
acquaintances in Middleford he was the sort the average person
would like at once the sort which men become interested in and
women spoil

He was rather quiet during this first call Babbie did twothirds
of the talking She felt it her duty as an older inhabitant to
display Uncle Jed and his creations for her relatives benefit
Vanes sailors ships and mills were pointed out and commented
upon

He makes every one Uncle Charlie she declared solemnly Hes
made every one thats here andoh lots and lots more He made
the big mill thats up in our garret You havent seen it yet
Uncle Charlie its going to be out on our lawn next springand he
gave it to me for afor a What kind of a present was that mill
you gave me Uncle Jed that time when Mamma and Petunia and I were
going back to Mrs Smalleys because we thought you didnt want us
to have the house any longer

Jed looked puzzled

Eh he queried What kind of a present I dont knows I
understand what you mean

I mean what kind of a present was it It wasnt a Christmas
present or a birthday present or anything like that but it must be
SOME kind of one What kind of present would you call it Uncle
Jed

Jed rubbed his chin

Weell he drawled I guess likely you might call it a forget
menot present if you had to call it anything

Barbara pondered

Aa forgetmenot is a kind of flower isnt it she asked

Umhm

But this is a windmill How can you make a flower out of a
windmill Uncle Jed

Jed rubbed his chin Well thats a question he admitted But
you can make flour IN a windmill cause Ive seen it done

More pondering on the young ladys part Then she gave it up

You mustnt mind if you dont understand him Uncle Charlie she
said in her most confidential and grownup manner He says lots
of things Petunia and I dont understand at all but hes awful
nice just the same Mamma says hes chokingno I mean joking
when he talks that way and that well understand the jokes lots
better when were older SHE understands them almost always she
added proudly

Phillips laughed Jeds slow smile appeared and vanished Looks
as if facin my jokes was no childs play dont it he observed
Well I will give in that gettin any fun out of em is a mans
size job

On the following Monday the young man took up his duties in the
bank Captain Hunniwell interviewed him liked him and hired him
all in the same forenoon By the end of the first week of their
association as employer and employee the captain liked him still
better He dropped in at the windmill shop to crow over the fact

He takes hold same as an oldtime first mate used to take hold of
a green crew he declared He had his job jumpin to the whistle
before the second day was over I declare I hardly dast to wake up
mornins for fear Ill find out our havin such a smart feller is
only a dream and that the livin calamity is Lute Small And to
think he added that you knew about him for the land knows how
long and would only hint instead of tellin I dont know as youd
have told yet if his sister hadnt told first Eh Would you

Jed deliberately picked a loose bristle from his paint brush

Maybe not he admitted

Gracious king Well WHY not

Oh I dont know Im kind oferfunny that way Like to take
my own time I guess likely Maybe youve noticed it Sam

Eh MAYBE Ive noticed it A blind cripple that was born deef
and dumb would have noticed that the first time he ran across you
What on earth are you doin to that paint brush tryin to
mesmerize it

His friend who had been staring mournfully at the brush now laid
it down

I was tryin to decide he drawled whether it needed hair tonic
or a wig So you like this Charlie Phillips do you

Sartin sure I do And the customers like him too Why old
Melissa Busteed was in yesterday and he waited on her for half an
hour seemed so and when the agony was over neither one of em had
got mad enough so anybody outside the buildin would notice it
And thats a miracle that aint happened in that bank for moren
ONE year Why I understand Melissa went down street tellin all
hands what a fine young man wed got workin for us    Here
what are you laughin at

The word was illchosen Jed seldom laughed but he had smiled
slightly and the captain noticed it

What are you grinnin at he repeated

Jeds hand moved across his chin

Gab Bearse was in a spell ago he replied and he was tellin
about what Melissa said

Well she said what I just said she said didnt she

Mr Winslow nodded Umhm he admitted she saiderall of
that

All of it Was there some more

Cordin to Gabe there was Cordin to him she said    she
said    er    Hum this brush aint much bettern the other
Seem to be comin down with the mange both of em

Gracious king Consarn the paint brushes Tell me what Melissa
said

Oh yes yes    Well cordin to Gabe she said twas a
comfort to know there was a place in this town where an unprotected
female could go and not be insulted

Captain Sams laugh could have been heard across the road

Ho ho he roared An unprotected female eh Cordin to my
notion its the male that needs protection when Melissas around
Ive seen Lute Small standin in the tellers cage tonguetied and
with the sweat standin on his forehead while Melissa gave him her
candid opinion of anybody that would vote to allow alcohol to be
sold by doctors in this town And twas ten minutes of twelve
Saturday mornin too and there was eight men waitin their turn
in line and nary one of them or Lute either had the spunk to ask
Melissa to hurry Ho ho unprotected female is good

He had his laugh out and then added But theres no doubt that
Charlies goin to be popular with the women Why even Maud seems
to take a shine to him Said she was surprised to have me show
such good judgment Course she didnt really mean she was
surprised he hastened to explain evidently fearing that even an
old friend like Jed might think he was criticizing his idolized
daughter She was just teasin her old dad thats all But I
could see that Charlie kind of pleased her Well he pleases me
and he pleases the cashier and the directors We agree all of us
that were mighty lucky I gave you some of the credit for gettin
him for us Jed he added magnanimously You dont really
deserve much because you hung back so and wouldnt tell his name
but I gave it to you just the same Whats a little credit between
friends eh Thats what Bluey Batcheldor said the other day when
he came in and wanted to borrow a hundred dollars on his personal
note Ho ho

Captain Sams glowing opinion of his paragon was soon echoed by the
majority of Orhams population Charlie Phillips although quiet
and inclined to keep to himself was liked by almost every one In
the bank and out of it he was polite considerate and always
agreeable During these first days Jed fancied that he detected in
the young man a certain alert dread a sense of being on guard a
reserve in the presence of strangers but he was not sure that this
was anything more than fancy a fancy inspired by the fact that he
knew the boys secret and was on the lookout for something of the
sort At all events no one else appeared to notice it and it
became more and more evident that Charlie as ninetenths of Orham
called him within a fortnight was destined to be the favorite here
that according to his sister he had been everywhere else

Of course there were a few who did not or would not like him
Luther Small the deposed bank clerk was bitter in his sneers and
caustic in his comments However as Lute loudly declared that he
was just going to quit anyhow that he wouldnt have worked for old
Hunniwell another week if he was paid a million a minute for it
his hatred of his successor seemed rather unaccountable Barzilla
Small Luthers fond parent also professed intense dislike for the
man now filling his sons position in the bank I dont know how
tis affirmed Barzilla but the fust time I see that young
upstart I says to myself Young feller you aint my kind This
remark being repeated to Captain Sam the latter observed Thats
gospel truth and thank the Lord for it

Another person who refused to accept Phillips favorably was Phineas
Babbitt Phineass bitterness was not the sort to sweeten over
night He disliked the new bank clerk and he told Jed Winslow why
They met at the post officePhineas had not visited the windmill
shop since the day when he received the telegram notifying him of
his sons enlistmentand some one of the group waiting for the
mail had happened to speak of Charlie Phillips Hes a nice
obligin young chap said the speaker Captain Jeremiah Burgess
I like him fustrate everybody does I guess

Mr Babbitt standing apart from the group his bristling chin
beard moving as he chewed his eleven oclock allowance of Sailors
Sweetheart turned and snarled over his shoulder

I dont he snapped

His tone was so sharp and his utterance so unexpected that Captain
Jerry jumped

Land of Goshen You bark like a dog with a sore throat he
exclaimed Why dont you like him

Cause I dont thats all

That aint much of a reason seems to me What have you got
against him Phin You dont know anything to his discredit do
you

Never you mind whether I do or not

Captain Jerry grunted but seemed disinclined to press the point
further Every one was surprised therefore when Jed Winslow moved
across to where Phineas was standing and looking mildly down at
the little man asked Do you know anything against him Phin

None of your business What are you buttin in for Shavins

I aint I just asked you thats all DO you know anything
against Charlie Phillips

None of your business I tell you

I know it aint But do you Phin

Each repetition of the question had been made in the same mild
monotonous drawl Captain Jerry and the other loungers burst into
a laugh Mr Babbitts always simmering temper boiled over

No I dont he shouted But I dont know anything in his
favor neither Hes a pet of Sam Hunniwell and thats enough for
me Sam Hunniwell and every one of his chums can go to the devil
Every one of em do you understand that Jed Winslow

Jed rubbed his chin The solemn expression of his face did not
change an atom Thank you Phin he drawled When Im ready to
start Ill get you to give me a letter of introduction

Jed had been fearful that her brothers coming might lessen the
intimate quality of Ruth Armstrongs friendship with and dependence
upon him He soon discovered to his delight that these fears
were groundless He found that the very fact that Ruth had made
him her sole confidant provided a common bond which brought them
closer together Ruths pride in her brothers success at the bank
and in the encomiums of the townsfolk had to find expression
somewhere She could express them to her landlord and she did
Almost every day she dropped in at the windmill shop for a moments
call and chat the subject of that chat always of course the
same

I told you he would succeed she declared her eyes shining and
her face alight I told you so Jed And he has Mr Barber
the cashier told me yesterday that Charles was the best man they
had had in the bank for years And every time I meet Captain
Hunniwell he stops to shake hands and congratulates me on having
such a brother And they like him not only because he is
successful in the bank but for himself so many people have told
me so Why for the first time since we came to Orham I begin to
feel as if I were becoming acquainted making friends

Jed nodded Hes a nice young chap he said quietly

Of course he is    You mustnt mind my shameless family
boasting she added with a little laugh It is only because I
am so proud of him and so gladso glad for us all

Jed did not mind It is doubtful if at that moment he was aware of
what she was saying He was thinking how her brothers coming had
improved her how well she was looking how much more color there
was in her cheeks and how good it was to hear her laugh once more
The windmill shop was a different place when she came It was a
lucky day for him when the Powlesses frightened him into letting
Barbara and her mother move into the old house for a months trial

Of course he did not express these thoughts aloud in fact he
expressed nothing whatever He thought and thought and after a
time gradually became aware that there was absolute silence in the
shop He looked at his caller and found that she was regarding him
intently a twinkle in her eye and an amused expression about her
mouth He started and awoke from his daydream

Eh he exclaimed Yesyes I guess so

She shook her head

You do she said Why I thought your opinion was exactly the
opposite

Eh Oh yes so tis so tis

Of course And just what did you say about it

Jed was confused He swallowed hard hesitated swallowed again
and stammered I Why Ithat isyou see

She laughed merrily You are a very poor pretender Jed she
declared Confess you havent the least idea what opinion I
mean

Wellwell to be right down honest II dont knows I have
Mrs Ruth

Of course you havent There isnt any opinion You have been
sitting there for the last five minutes staring straight at me and
picking that paint brush to pieces I doubt if you even knew I was
here

Eh Oh yes I know that I know that all right Tut tut
inspecting the damaged brush Thats a nice mess aint it Now
what do you suppose I did that for Im scared to death when I
have one of those gotosleeptic fits that Ill pick my head to
pieces Not that that would be as big a loss as a good paint
brush he added reflectively

His visitor smiled I think it would she said Neither Babbie
nor I could afford to lose that head it and its owner have been
too thoughtful and kind But tell me what WERE you thinking about
just then

The question appeared to embarrass Mr Winslow a good deal He
colored fidgeted and stammered Nothin nothin of any
account he faltered Myermy brain was takin a walk around
my attic I callate Theres plenty of room up there for a
tramp

No tell me I want to know Her expression changed and she
added You werent thinking ofof Charleshis trouble at
Middleford You dont still think me wrong in not telling Captain
Hunniwell

Eh    Oh no no I wasnt thinkin that at all

But you dont answer my question Well never mind I am really
almost happy for the first time in ever so long and I mean to
remain so if I can I am glad I did not tellglad And you must
agree with me Mr WinslowJed I meanor I shall not run in so
often to talk in this confidential way

Eh Not run in Godfreys Mrs Ruth dont talk so Excuse my
strong language but you scared me talkin about not runnin in

You deserve to be scared just a little for criticizing me in
your thoughts Oh dont think me frivolous she pleaded with
another swift change I realize it was all wrong And some time
by and by after Charles has firmly established himself after they
really know him I shall go to the bank people or he will go to
them and tell the whole story By that time Im sureIm sure
they will forgive us both Dont you think so

Jed would have forgiven her anything He nodded

Sartin sure they will he said Then asking a question that had
been in his thoughts for some time he said How does your brother
feel about it himself Mrs Ruth

At first he thought he should tell everything He did not want to
take the position under false pretenses he said But when I
explained how he might lose this opportunity and what an
opportunity it might be for us all he agreed that perhaps it was
best to wait And I am sure it is best Jed But then I mean to
put the whole dreadful business from my mind if I can and be
happy with my little girl and my brother And I am happy I feel
almost like a girl myself So you mustnt remind me Jed and you
mustnt criticize me even though you and I both know you are
right You are my only confidant you know and I dont know what
in the world I should do without you so try to bear with me if
you can

Jed observed that he guessed likely there wouldnt be much trouble
at his end of the line providing she could manage to worry along
with a feller that went to sleep sittin up and in the daytime
like an owl After she had gone however he again relapsed into
slumber and his dreams judging by his expression must have been
pleasant

That afternoon he had an unexpected visit He had just finished
washing his dinner dishes and he and Babbie were in the outer shop
together when the visitor came Jed was droning Old Hundred
with improvisations of his own the said improvising having the
effect of slowing down the already extremely deliberate anthem
until the result compared to the original was for speed as an
oyster scow compared to an electric launch This musical crawl he
used as an accompaniment to the sorting and piling of various parts
of an order just received from a Southern resort Barbara was
helping him at least she called her activities helping When
Jed had finished counting a pile of vanes or mill parts she counted
them to make sure Usually her count and his did not agree so
both counted again getting in each others way and as Mr Winslow
expressed it having a good time generally And this remark
intended to be facetious was after all pretty close to the literal
truth Certainly Babbie was enjoying herself and Jed where an
impatient man would have been frantic was enjoying her enjoyment
Petunia perched in lopsided fashion on a heap of millsides was
apparently superintending

There declared Jed stacking a dozen sailors beside a dozen of
what the order called birdhouses medium knocked down There
thats the livin last one I do believe Hi hum Now weve got
to box em havent we    Yees yes yes yes   
Hum   


 Didedidedide   


Wheres that hammer Oh yes here tis


 Didedide


Now where on earth have I put that pencil Babbie Have I
swallowed it DONT tell me youve seen me swallow it cause that
flavor of leadpencil never did agree with me

The child burst into a trill of laughter

Why Uncle Jed she exclaimed there it is behind your ear

Is it Sho so tis Now that proves the instinct of dumb
animals dont it That leadpencil knew enough to realize that my
ear was so big that anything short of a cordwood stick could hide
behind it Tut tut Surprisin surprisin

But Uncle Jed a pencil isnt an animal

Eh Aint it Seemed to me Id read somethin about the ragin
leadpencil seekin whom it might devour But maybe that was a
erlion or a clam or somethin

Babbie looked at him in puzzled fashion for a moment Then she
sagely shook her head and declared Uncle Jed I think you are
perfectly scrusheaking Petunia and I are convulshed We she
stopped listened and then announced Uncle Jed I THINK somebody
came up the walk

The thought received confirmation immediately in the form of a
knock at the door Jed looked over his spectacles

Hum he mused sadly theres no peace for the wicked Babbie
No sooner get one order all fixed and out of the way than along
comes a customer and you have to get another one ready If Id
known twas goin to be like this Id never have gone into
business would you But maybe taint a customer maybe its
Capn Sam or Gabe Bearse or somebody    They wouldnt knock
though taint likely anyhow Gabe wouldnt    Come in he
called as the knock was repeated

The person who entered the shop was a tall man in uniform The
afternoon was cloudy and the outer shop piled high with stock and
lumber was shadowy The man in uniform looked at Jed and Barbara
and they looked at him He spoke first

Pardon me he said but is your name Winslow

Jed nodded Yes sir he replied deliberately I guess likely
tis

I have come here to see if you could let me have

Babbie interrupted him Forgetting her manners in the excitement
of the discovery which had just flashed upon her she uttered an
exclamation

Oh Uncle Jed she exclaimed

Jed startled turned toward her

Yes he asked hastily Whats the matter

Dont you know Hehes the nice officer one

Eh The nice what What are you talkin about Babbie

Babbie now somewhat abashed and ashamed of her involuntary
outburst turned red and hesitated

I mean she stammered I mean hehes theofficer one that
that was nice to us that day

That day What day    Just excuse the little girl wont
you he added apologetically turning to the caller Shes made
a mistake she thinks she knows you I guess

But I DO Uncle Jed Dont you remember Over at the flying
place

The officer himself took a step forward

Why of course he said pleasantly She is quite right I
thought your faces were familiar You and she were over at the
camp that day when one of our construction plans was lost She
found it for us And Lieutenant Rayburn and I have been grateful
many times since he added

Jed recognized him then

Well I snum he exclaimed Of course Sartin If it hadnt
been for you Id have lost my life and Babbied have lost her clam
chowder That carpenter feller would have had me hung for a spy in
ten minutes more Im real glad to see you ColonelColonel Wood
Thats your name if I recollect right

Not exactly My name is Grover and Im not a colonel worse
luck only a major

Sho Grover eh Now how in the nation did I get it Wood Oh
yes I callate twas mixin up groves and woods Tut tut
Wonder I didnt call you Pines or Bushes or somethin   
But there sit down sit down Im awful glad you dropped in Id
about given up hopin you would

He brought forward a chair unceremoniously dumping two stacks of
carefully sorted and counted vanes and sailors from its seat to the
floor prior to doing so Major Grover declined to sit

I should like to but I mustnt he said And I shouldnt claim
credit for deliberately making you a social call I camethat is
I was sent here on a matter oferwell first aid to the injured
I came to see if you would lend me a crank

Jed looked at him Aa what he asked

A crank a crank for my car I motored over from the camp and
stopped at the telegraph office When I came out my car refused to
go the selfstarter appears to have gone on a strike I had left
my crank at the camp and my only hope seemed to be to buy or borrow
one somewhere I asked the two or three fellows standing about the
telegraph office where I might be likely to find one No one
seemed to know but just then the old grouchexcuse me person who
keeps the hardware store came along

Eh Phin Babbitt Little man with the stub of a paint brush
growin on his chin

Yes thats the one I asked him where I should be likely to find
a crank He said if I came across to this shop I ought to find
one

He did eh    Hum

Yes he did So I came

Hum

This observation being neither satisfying nor particularly
illuminating Major Grover waited for something more explicit He
waited in vain Mr Winslow his eyes fixed upon the toe of his
visitors military boot appeared to be mesmerized

So I came repeated the major after an interval

Eh    Oh yes yes So you did so you did    Hum

He rose and walking to the window peeped about the edge of the
shade across and down the road in the direction of the telegraph
office

Phineas he drawled musingly and Squealer and Lute Small and
Bluey Huum    Yes yes

He turned away from the window and began intoning a hymn Major
Grover seemed to be divided between a desire to laugh and a
tendency toward losing patience

Well he queried after another interval about that crank
Have you one I might borrow It may not fit probably wont but I
should like to try it

Jed sighed Theres a crank here he drawled but it wouldnt
be much use around automobiles Im afraid Im it

What I dont understand

I say Im it My pet name around Orham is town crank Thats why
Phineas sent you to my shop He said you OUGHT to find a crank
here He was right Im most generally in

This statement was made quietly deliberately and with no trace of
resentment Having made it the speaker began picking up the vanes
and sailors he had spilled when he proffered his visitor the chair
Major Grover colored and frowned

Do you mean to tell me he demanded that that fellow sent me
over here becausebecause

Because Im town crank Yees thats what I mean

Indeed That is his idea of a joke is it

Seems to be Hes an awful comical critter Phin Babbitt isin
his own way

Well its not my way He sends me over here to make an ass of
myself and insult you

Now now Major excuse me Phin didnt have any idea that youd
insult me You see with the fleeting smile he wouldnt believe
anybody could do that

Grover turned sharply to the door Mr Winslow spoke his name

ErMajor Grover he said gently I wouldnt

The major paused Wouldnt what he demanded

Go over there and tell Phin and the rest what you think of em
If twould do em any good Id say For mercy sakes go But
twouldnt they wouldnt believe it

Grovers lips tightened

Telling it might do ME some good he observed significantly

Yes I know But maybe we might get the same good or more in a
different way    Hum    Whaterbrand of automobile is
yours

The major told him Jed nodded

Hum    yes he drawled I see    I see

Grover laughed Ill be hanged if I do he observed

Eh    Well I tell you you sit down and let Babbie talk
Petunia to you a minute or two Ill be right back

He hurried into the back shop closing the door after him A
moment later Grover caught a glimpse of him crossing the back yard
and disappearing over the edge of the bluff

Where in the world has the fellow gone he soliloquized aloud
amused although impatient Barbara took it upon herself to answer
Uncle Jed had left the caller in her charge and she felt her
responsibilities

Hes gone down the shore path she said I dont know where
else hes gone but its all right anyway

Oh is it You seem quite sure of it young lady

I am Everything Uncle Jed does is right Sometimes you dont
think so at first but it turns out that way Mamma says he is
petuniano I mean peculiar butbut veryreliable the last
word conquered after a visible struggle She says if you do what
he tells you to you will be most always glad I think always
without any most she added

Major Grover laughed Thats a reputation for infallibility worth
having he observed

Barbara did not know what he meant but she had no intention of
betraying that fact

Yes she agreed A moment later she suggested Dont you think
youd better sit down He told you to you know

Great Scott so he did I must obey orders mustnt I But he
told you to talksomething or other to me I think What was it

He told me to talk Petunia to you There she isup there

The major regarded Petunia who was seated upon the heap of mill
sides in a most haphazard and dissipated attitude

She is my oldest daughter continued Barbara Shes very
advanced for her years

Dear me

Yes And    oh here comes Mamma

Mrs Armstrong entered the shop The major rose Barbara did the
honors

I was just going to come in Mamma she explained but Uncle Jed
asked me to stay and talk to MrI mean MajorGrover till he came
back Hes gone out but he wont be long Mamma this is Mr
Major Grover the one who kept Uncle Jed from being spied over at
the flying place that day when I found the plan paper and he made a
shingle boat sail out of it

Ruth came forward She had been walking along the edge of the
bluff looking out over the tumbled gray and white water and the
late October wind had tossed her hair and brought the color to her
cheeks She put out her hand

Oh yes she said How do you do Major Grover I have heard a
great deal about you since the day of Babbies picnic Im sure I
owe you an apology for the trouble my small daughter must have
caused that day

She and the major shook hands The latter expressed himself as
being very glad to meet Mrs Armstrong He looked as if he meant
it

And no apologies are due not from your side at least he
declared If it had not been for your little girl our missing
plan might have been missing yet

Fifteen minutes elapsed before the owner of the windmill shop
returned When he did come hurrying up the bluff and in at the
back door heated and out of breath no one seemed to have missed
him greatly Major Grover who might reasonably have been expected
to show some irritation at his long wait appeared quite oblivious
of the fact that he had waited at all He and Barbara were seated
side by side upon a packing case while Ruth occupied the chair
When Jed came panting in it was Babbie who greeted him

Oh Uncle Jed she exclaimed you just ought to have been here
MrI mean Major Grover has been telling Mamma and me about going
up in ain a diggible balloon It was awfly interesting Wasnt
it Mamma

Her mother laughingly agreed that it was Jed whose hands were
full deposited his burden upon another packing case The said
burden consisted of no less than three motor car cranks Grover
regarded them with surprise

Where in the world did you get those he demanded The last I
saw of you you were disappearing over that bank apparently headed
out to sea Do you dig those things up on the flats hereabouts
like clams

Jed rubbed his chin Nots I know of he replied I borrowed
these down at Joshua Rogers garage

Rogers garage repeated Grover That isnt near here is it

It is an eighth of a mile from here declared Ruth And not
down by the beach either What do you mean Jed

Jed was standing by the front window peeping out Umhm he
said musingly theyre still there the whole lot of em waitin
for you to come out Major    Hum    dear dear And
theyre all doubled up now laughin ahead of time    Dear
dear this is a world of disappointment sure enough

What ARE you talking about demanded Major Grover

JED exclaimed Ruth

Barbara said nothing She was accustomed to her Uncle Jeds
vagaries and knew that in his own good time an explanation would
be forthcoming It came now

Why you see said Jed Phin Babbitt and the rest sendin you
over here to find a crank was their little joke Theyre enjoyin
it now The one thing needed to make em happy for life is to see
you come out of here emptyhanded and so bilin mad that you froth
over If you come out smilin and with what you came after why
why then the cream of their joke has turned a little sour as you
might say See

Grover laughed Yes I see that plain enough he agreed And
Im certainly obliged to you I owed those fellows one But what
I dont see is how you got those cranks by going down to the
seashore

Weell if Id gone straight up the road to Rogerss our jokin
friends would have known thats where the cranks came from I
wanted em to think they came from right here So I went over the
bank back of the shop where they couldnt see me along the beach
till I got abreast of Joshuas and then up across lots I came
back the way I went I hope those things ll fit Major One of
em will I guess likely

The major laughed again I certainly am obliged to you Mr
Winslow he said And I must say you took a lot of trouble on my
account

Jed sighed although there was a little twinkle in his eye

Twant altogether on your account he drawled I owed em one
same as you did I was the crank they sent you to

Their visitor bade Barbara and her mother good afternoon gathered
up his cranks and turned to the door

Ill step over and start the car he said Then Ill come back
and return these things

Jed shook his head I wouldnt he said You may stop again
before you get back to Bayport Rogers is in no hurry for em he
said so You take em along and fetch em in next time youre
over I want you to call again anyhow and these cranks ll make a
good excuse for doin it he added

Oh I see Yes so they will With that understanding Ill take
them along Thanks again and good afternoon

He hastened across the street The two in the shop watched from
the window until the car started and moved out of sight The group
by the telegraph office seemed excited about something they
laughed no longer and there was considerable noisy argument

Jeds lip twitched The best laid plans of miceand skunks
he quoted solemnly Hm    That Major Grover seems like a
good sort of chap

I think hes awful nice declared Babbie

Ruth said nothing


CHAPTER XIII


October passed and November came The very last of the summer
cottages were closed Orham settled down for its regular winter
hibernation This year it was a bit less of a nap than usual
because of the activity at the aviation camp at East Harniss The
swarm of carpenters plumbers and mechanics was larger than ever
there now and the buildings were hastening toward completion for
the first allotment of aviators soldiers and recruits was due to
arrive in March Major Grover was a busy and a worried man but he
usually found time to drop in at the windmill shop for a moment or
two on each of his brief motor trips to Orham Sometimes he found
Jed alone more often Barbara was there also and semi
occasionally Ruth The major and Charles Phillips met and
appeared to like each other Charles was still on the rising tide
of local popularity Even Gabe Bearse had a good word to say for
him among the many which he said concerning him Phineas Babbitt
however continued to express dislike or at the most
indifference

Im too old a bird declared the vindictive little hardware
dealer to bow down afore a slick tongue and a goodlookin
figgerhead Hes one of Sam Hunniwells pets and thats enough for
me Anybody that ties up to Sam Hunniwell must have a rotten plank
in em somewheres give it time and twill come out

Charles and Jed Winslow were by this time good friends The young
man usually spent at least a few minutes of each day chatting with
his eccentric neighbor They were becoming more intimate at times
almost confidential although Phillips like every other friend or
acquaintance of Shavings Winslow was inclined to patronize or
condescend a bit in his relations with the latter No one took the
windmill maker altogether seriously not even Ruth Armstrong
although she perhaps came nearest to doing so Charles would drop
in at the shop of a morning in the interval between breakfast and
bank opening and perching on a pile of stock or the workbench
would discuss various things He and Jed were alike in one
characteristiceach had the habit of absentmindedness and lapsing
into silence in the middle of a conversation Jeds lapses of
course were likely to occur in the middle of a sentence even in
the middle of a word with the younger man the symptoms were not so
acute

Well Charlie observed Mr Winslow on one occasion a raw
November morning of the week before Thanksgiving hows the bank
gettin along

Charles was a bit more silent that morning than he had been of
late He appeared to be somewhat reflective even somber Jed on
the lookout for just such symptoms was trying to cheer him up

Oh all right enough I guess was the reply

Like your work as well as ever dont you

Yesoh yes I like it what there is of it It isnt what youd
call strenuous

No I presume likely not but I shouldnt wonder if they gave you
somethin more responsible some of these days They know youre up
to doin it Capn Sams told me so moren once

Here occurred one of the lapses just mentioned Phillips said
nothing for a minute or more Then he asked What sort of a man
is Captain Hunniwell

Eh What sort of a man You ought to know him yourself pretty
well by this time You see more of him every day than I do

I dont mean as a business man or anything like that I mean what
sort of man is heerinside Is he always as goodnatured as he
seems How is he around his own house With his daughteroror
things like that Youve known him all your life you know and I
havent

Umyeesyes Ive known Sam for a good many years Hes square
all through Sam is Honest as the day is long and

Charles stirred uneasily I know that of course he interrupted
I wasnt questioning his honesty

Jeds tender conscience registered a pang The reference to
honesty had not been made with any ulterior motive

Sartin sartin he said I know you wasnt Charlie course I
know that You wanted to know what sort of a man Sam was in his
family and such I judge Well hes a mighty good fatheralmost
too good I suppose likely some folks would say He just bows down
and worships that daughter of his Anything Maud wants that he can
give her she can have And she wants a good deal I will give in
he added with his quiet drawl

His caller did not speak Jed whistled a few mournful bars and
sharpened a chisel on an oilstone

If John D Vanderbilt should come around courtin Maud he went
on after a moment I dont know as Sam would callate he was good
enough for her Anyhow hed feel that twas her that was doin the
favor not John D    And I guess hed be right I dont know
any Vanderbilts but Ive known Maud since she was a baby Shes a

He paused inspecting a nick in the chisel edge Again Phillips
shifted in his seat on the edge of the workbench

Well he asked

Eh Jed looked up in mild inquiry What is it he said

Thats what I want to knowwhat is it You were talking about
Maud Hunniwell You said you had known her since she was a baby
and that she wassomething or other that was as far as you got

Sho    Hum    Oh yes yes I was goin to say she was a
mighty nice girl as nice as she is goodlookin and lively
Theres a dozen young chaps in this county crazy about her this
minute but there aint any one of em good enough for her   
Hello you goin so soon Tisnt halfpast nine yet is it

Phillips did not answer His somber expression was still in
evidence Jed would have liked to cheer him up but he did not
know how However he made an attempt by changing the subject

How is Babbie this mornin he asked

Shes as lively as a cricket of course And full of excitement
Shes going to school next Monday you know Youll rather miss
her about the shop here wont you

Miss her My land of Goshen I shouldnt be surprised if I
follered her to school myself like Marys little lamb Miss her
Dont talk

Well so long    What is it

Eh

What is it you want to say You look as if you wanted to say
something

Do I    Hum    Oh twasnt anything special   
Howserhows your sister this mornin

Oh shes well I havent seen her so well sincethat is for a
long time Youve made a great hit with Sis Jed he added with
a laugh She cant say enough good things about you Says you
are her one dependable in Orham or something like that

Jeds face turned a bright red Oh sho sho he protested she
mustnt talk that way I havent done anything

She says you have Well byby

He went away It was some time before Jed resumed his chisel
sharpening

Later when he came to reflect upon his conversation with young
Phillips there were one or two things about it which puzzled him
They were still puzzling him when Maud Hunniwell came into the
shop Maud in a new fall suit hat and fur was a picture a fact
of which she was as well aware as the next person Jed as always
was very glad to see her

Well well he exclaimed Talk about angels andand they fly
in so to speak Real glad to see you Maud Sit down sit down
Theres a chair round here somewheres Now where Oh yes Im
sittin in it Hum Thats one of the reasons why I didnt see
it I presume likely You take it and Ill fetch another from the
kitchen No I wont Ill sit on the bench    Hum    has
your pa got any money left in that bank of his

Miss Hunniwell was naturally surprised at the question

Why I hope so she said Did you think he hadnt

Weell I didnt know That dress of yours and that new
bonnet must have used up considerble to say nothin of that
woodchuck youve got round your neck Tis a woodchuck aint
it he added solemnly

Woodchuck Well I like that If you knew what a silver fox
costs and how long I had to coax before I got this one you would be
more careful in your language she declared with a toss of her
head

Jed sighed Thats the trouble with me he observed I never
know enough to pick out the right thingsor folksto be careful
with If I set out to be real toady and humble to what I think is
a peacock it generally turns out to be a Shanghai rooster And the
same when its tother way about Its a great gift to be able to
tell the realerwhat is itgold foxes from the woodchucks in
this life I aint got it and thats one of the two hundred
thousand reasons why I aint rich

He began to hum one of his doleful melodies Maud laughed

Mercy what a long sermon she exclaimed No wonder you sing a
hymn after it

Jed sniffed Um    yees he drawled If I was more
worldlyminded Id take up a collection probably Well hows all
the United States Army the gold lace part of it I mean

His visitor laughed again Those that I know seem to be very well
and happy she replied

Um    yes    sartin Theyd be happy naturally How could
they help it under the circumstances

He began picking over an assortment of small hardware varying his
musical accompaniment by whistling instead of singing His visitor
looked at him rather oddly

Jed she observed youre changed

Changed I aint changed my clothes if thats what you mean
Course if Id know I was goin to have bankers daughters with
goldermuskrats round their necks come to see me Id have
dressed up

Oh I dont mean your clothes I mean youyourselfyouve
changed

Ive changed How for mercy sakes

Oh lots of ways You pay the ladies compliments now You
wouldnt have done that a year ago

Eh Pay compliments Im afraid youre mistaken Your pa says
Im so absentminded and forgetful that I dont pay some of my
bills till the folks I owe em to make proclamations theyre goin
to sue me and other bills I pay two or three times over

Dont try to escape by dodging the subject You HAVE changed in
the last few months I think holding the tail of the silver fox
before her face and regarding him over it I think you must be in
love

Eh Jed looked positively frightened In love

Yes Youre blushing now

Now now Maud that aintthats sunburn

No its not sunburn Who is it Jed mischievously Is it the
pretty widow Is it Mrs Armstrong

A good handful of the hardware fell to the floor Jed thankfully
scrambled down to pick it up Miss Hunniwell expressing
contrition at being indirectly responsible for the mishap offered
to help him He declined of course but in the little argument
which followed the dangerous and embarrassing topic was forgotten
It was not until she was about to leave the shop that Maud again
mentioned the Armstrong name And then oddly enough it was she
not Mr Winslow who showed embarrassment

Jed she said what do you suppose I came here for this morning

Jeds reply was surprisingly prompt

To show your new rigout of course he said Vanity of
vanities all is vanity There NOW I can take up a collection
cant I

His visitor pouted If you do I shant put anything in the box
she declared The idea of thinking that I came here just to show
off my new things Ive a good mind not to invite you at all now

She doubtless expected apologies and questions as to what
invitation was meant They might have been forthcoming had not the
windmill maker been engaged just at that moment in gazing
abstractedly at the door of the little stove which heated or was
intended to heat the workshop He did not appear to have heard
her remark so the young lady repeated it Still he paid no
attention Miss Maud having inherited a goodly share of the
Hunniwell disposition demanded an explanation

What in the world is the matter with you she asked Why are
you staring at that stove

Jed started and came to life Eh he exclaimed Oh I was
thinkin what an everlastin nuisance twasthe stove I mean It
needs more wood about every five minutes in the day seems to
needs it now thats what made me think of it I was just
wonderin if twouldnt be a good notion to set it up out in the
yard

Out in the yard Put the stove out in the yard For goodness
sake what for

Jed clasped his knee in his hand and swung his foot back and forth

Oh he drawled if twas out in the yard I shouldnt know whether
it needed wood or not so twouldnt be all the time botherin me

However he rose and replenished the stove Miss Hunniwell
laughed Then she said Jed you dont deserve it because you
didnt hear me when I first dropped the hint but I came here
with an invitation for you Pa and I expect you to eat your
Thanksgiving dinner with us

If she had asked him to eat it in jail Jed could not have been more
disturbed

Nownow Maud he stammered IIm ever so much obliged to
you but II dont see how

Nonsense I see how perfectly well You always act just this way
whenever I invite you to anything Youre not afraid of Pa or me
are you

Weell well I aint afraid of your Pa s I know of but of
course when such a fascinatin young woman as you comes along all
rigged up to kill why its natural that an old single relic like
me should get kind of nervous

Maud clasped her hands Oh she cried theres another
compliment You HAVE changed Jed Im going to ask Father what
it means

This time Jed was really alarmed Now now now he protested
dont go tell your Pa yarns about me Hell come in here and
pester me to death You know what a tease he is when he gets
started Dont Maud dont

She looked hugely delighted at the prospect Her eyes sparkled
with mischief I certainly shall tell him she declared unless
you promise to eat with us on Thanksgiving Day Oh come along
dont be so silly Youve eaten at our house hundreds of times

This was a slight exaggeration Jed had eaten there possibly five
times in the last five years He hesitated

Aint goin to be any other company is there he asked after a
moment It was now that Maud showed her first symptoms of
embarrassment

Why she said twirling the fox tail and looking at the floor
there may be one or two more I thoughtI mean Pa and I thought
perhaps we might invite Mrs Armstrong and Babbie You know them
Jed so they wont be like strangers And Pa thinks Mrs Armstrong
is a very nice lady a real addition to the town Ive heard him
say so often she added earnestly

Jed was silent She looked up at him from under the brim of the
new hat

You wouldnt mind them Jed would you she asked They
wouldnt be like strangers you know

Jed rubbed his chin II dont knows I would he mused
always providin they didnt mind me But I dont callate Mrs
RuthMrs Armstrong I meanwould want to leave Charlie to home
alone on Thanksgivin Day If she took Babbie you know there
wouldnt be anybody left to keep him company

Miss Hunniwell twirled the fox tail in an opposite direction Oh
of course she said with elaborate carelessness we should
invite Mrs Armstrongs brother if we invited her Of course we
should HAVE to do that

Jed nodded but he made no comment His visitor watched him from
beneath the hat brim

Youyou havent any objection to Mr Phillips have you she
queried

Eh Objections To Charlie Oh no no

You like him dont you Father likes him very much

Yes indeed like him fustrate All hands like Charlie the
womenfolks especially

There was a perceptible interval before Miss Hunniwell spoke again
What do you mean by that she asked

Eh Oh nothin except that accordin to your dad hes a
specially good hand at waitin on the women and girls up at the
bank polite and nice to em you know Hes even made a hit with
old Melissy Busteed and it takes a regular feller to do that

He would not promise to appear at the Hunniwell home on
Thanksgiving but he did agree to think it over Maud had to be
content with that However she declared that she should take his
acceptance for granted

We shall set a place for you she said Of course youll come
It will be such a nice party you and Pa and Mrs Armstrong and I
and little Babbie Oh well have great fun see if we dont

And Charlie youre leavin out Charlie Jed reminded her

Oh yes so I was Well I suppose hell come too Goodby

She skipped away waving him a farewell with the tail of the silver
fox Jed gazing after her rubbed his chin reflectively

His indecision concerning the acceptance of the Hunniwell
invitation lasted until the day before Thanksgiving Then Barbara
added her persuasions to those of Captain Sam and his daughter and
he gave in

If you dont go Uncle Jed asserted Babbie were all goin to
be awfully disappointed specially me and Petuniaand Mammaand
Uncle Charlie

Oh then the rest of you folks wont care I presume likely

Babbie thought it over Why there arent any more of us she
said Oh I see Youre joking again arent you Uncle Jed
Most everybody I know laughs when they make jokes but you dont
you look as if you were going to cry Thats why I dont laugh
sometimes right off she explained politely If you was really
feeling so bad it wouldnt be nice to laugh you know

Jed laughed then himself So Petunia would feel bad if I didnt
go to Sams would she he inquired

Yes solemnly She told me she shouldnt eat one single thing
if you didnt go Shes a very highstrung child

That settled it Jed argued that Petunia must on no account be
strung higher than she was and consented to dine at the
Hunniwells

The day before Thanksgiving brought another visitor to the windmill
shop one as welcome as he was unexpected Jed hearing the door
to the stock room open shouted Come in from his seat at the
workbench in the inner room When his summons was obeyed he looked
up to see a khakiclad figure advancing with extended hand

Why hello Major he exclaimed Im real glad to Eh
taint Major Grover is it Who Why Leander Babbitt Well
well well

Young Babbitt was straight and squareshouldered and brown
Military training and life at Camp Devens had wrought the miracle
in his case which it works in so many Jed found it hard to
recognize the stoopshouldered son of the hardware dealer in the
spruce young soldier before him When he complimented Leander upon
the improvement the latter disclaimed any credit

Thank the drill master second and yourself first Jed he said
Theyll make a man of a fellow up there at Ayer if hell give em
half a chance Probably I shouldnt have had the chance if it
hadnt been for you You were the one who really put me up to
enlisting

Jed refused to listen Cant make a man out of a punkinhead he
asserted If you hadnt had the right stuff in you Leander
drill masters nor nobody else could have fetched it out How do
you like belongin to Uncle Sam

Young Babbitt liked it and said so I feel as if I were doing
something at last he said as if I was part of the biggest thing
in the world Course Im only a mighty little part but after
all its something

Jed nodded gravely You bet its somethin he argued Its a
lot a whole lot I only wish I was standin alongside of you in
the ranks Leander    Id be a sight though wouldnt I he
added his lip twitching in the fleeting smile What do you think
the Commodore or General or whoever tis bosses things at the
camp would say when he saw me Hed think the flagpole had grown
feet and was walkin round I callate

He asked his young friend what reception he met with upon his
return home Leander smiled ruefully

My stepmother seemed glad enough to see me he said She and I
had some long talks on the subject and I think she doesnt blame me
much for going into the service I told her the whole story and
down in her heart I believe she thinks I did right

Jed nodded Dont see how she could help it he said How does
your dad take it

Leander hesitated Well he said you know Father He doesnt
change his mind easily He and I didnt get as close together as I
wish we could And it wasnt my fault that we didnt he added
earnestly

Jed understood He had known Phineas Babbitt for many years and he
knew the little mans hard implacable disposition and the violence
of his prejudices

Umhm he said All the same Leander I believe your father
thinks more of you than he does of anything else on earth

I shouldnt wonder if you was right Jed But on the other hand
Im afraid he and I will never be the same after I come back from
the waralways providing I do come back of course

Sshh sshh Dont talk that way Course youll come back

You never can tell However if I knew I wasnt going to it
wouldnt make any difference in my feelings about going Im glad
I enlisted and Im mighty thankful to you for backing me up in it
I shant forget it Jed

Sho sho Its easy to tell other folks what to do Thats how
the Kaiser earns his salary only he gives advice to the Almighty
and I aint got as far along as that yet

They discussed the war in general and by sections Just before he
left young Babbitt said

Jed there is one thing that worries me a little in connection
with Father He was bitter against the war before we went into it
and before he and Capn Sam Hunniwell had their string of rows
Since then and since I enlisted he has been worse than ever The
things he says against the government and against the country make
ME want to lick himand Im his own son I am really scared for
fear hell get himself jailed for being a traitor or something of
that sort

Mr Winslow asked if Phineas feeling against Captain Hunniwell had
softened at all Leanders reply was a vigorous negative

Not a bit he declared He hates the capn worse than ever if
thats possible and hell do him some bad turn some day if he
can Im afraid You must think its queer my speaking this way of
my own father he added Well I dont to any one else Somehow
a fellow always feels as if he could say just what he thinks to
you Jed Winslow I feel that way anyhow

He and Jed shook hands at the door in the early November twilight
Leander was to eat his Thanksgiving dinner at home and then leave
for camp on the afternoon train

Well goodby he said

Jed seemed loath to relinquish the handclasp

Oh dont say goodby its just See you later he replied

Leander smiled Of course Well then see you later Jed
Well write once in a while eh

Jed promised The young fellow strode off into the dusk Somehow
with his square shoulders and his tanned resolute country face he
seemed to typify Young America setting cheerfully forth to face
anythingthat Honor and Decency may still be more than empty words
in this world of ours


CHAPTER XIV


The Hunniwell Thanksgiving dinner was an entire success Even
Captain Sam himself was forced to admit it although he professed
to do so with reluctance

Yes he said with an elaborate wink in the direction of his
guests its a pretty good dinner considerin everything Of
course taint what a feller used to get down at Sam Coys eatin
house on Atlantic Avenue but its pretty goodas I say when
everythings considered

His daughter was highly indignant Do you mean to say that this
dinner isnt as good as those you used to get at that Boston
restaurant Pa she demanded Dont you dare say such a thing

Her father tugged at his beard and looked tremendously solemn

Well he observed as a boy I was brought up to always speak the
truth and Ive tried to live up to my early trainin Speakin as
a truthful man then Im obliged to say that this dinner aint
like those I used to get at Sam Coys

Ruth put in a word Well then Captain Hunniwell she said I
think the restaurant you refer to must be one of the best in the
world

Before the captain could reply Maud did it for him

Mrs Armstrong she cautioned you mustnt take my father too
seriously He dearly loves to catch people with what he hopes is a
joke For a minute he caught even me this time but I see through
him now He didnt say the dinner at his precious restaurant was
BETTER than this one he said it wasnt like it thats all Which
is probably true she added with withering scorn But what I
should like to know is what he means by his everything
considered

Her fathers gravity was unshaken Well he said all I meant
was that this was a pretty good dinner considerin who was
responsible for gettin it up

I see I see Mrs Ellis our housekeeper and I are responsible
Mrs Armstrong so you understand now who he is shooting at Very
well Pa she added calmly the rest of us will have our dessert
now You can get yours at Sam Coys

The dessert was mince pie and a Boston frozen pudding the latter
an especial favorite of Captain Sams He capitulated at once

Kamerad Kamerad he cried holding up both hands Thats
what the Germans say when they surrender aint it I give in
Maud You can shoot me against a stone wall if you want to only
give me my frozen puddin first It aint so much that I like the
puddin he explained to Mrs Armstrong but I never can make out
whether its flavored with tansy or spearmint Maud wont tell me
but I know its somethin oldfashioned and reminds me of my
grandmother or maybe its my grandfather come to think I guess
likely tis

Ruth grasped his meaning later when she tasted the pudding and
found it flavored with New England rum

After dinner they adjourned to the parlor Maud being coaxed by
her adoring father played the piano Then she sang Then they
all sang all except Jed and the captain that is The latter
declared that his voice had mildewed in the damp weather they had
been having lately and Jed excused himself on the ground that he
had been warned not to sing because it was not healthy

Barbara was surprised and shocked

Why Uncle Jed she cried You sing EVER so much I heard you
singing this morning

Jed nodded Yees he drawled but I was alone then and Im
liable to take chances with my own health Bluey Batcheldor was in
the shop last week though when I was tunin up and it disagreed
with HIM

I dont believe it Uncle Jed with righteous indignation How
do you know it did

Cause he said so He listened a spell and then said I made him
sick so I took his word for it

Captain Sam laughed uproariously You must be pretty bad then
Jed he declared Anybody who disagrees with Bluey Batcheldor
must be pretty nigh the limit

Jed nodded Umhm he said reflectively pretty nigh but not
quite Always seemed to me the real limit was anybody who agreed
with him

So Jed with Babbie on his knee sat in the corner of the bay
window looking out on the street while Mrs Armstrong and her
brother and Miss Hunniwell played and sang and the captain
applauded vigorously and loudly demanded more After a time Ruth
left the group at the piano and joined Jed and her daughter by the
window Captain Hunniwell came a few minutes later

Make a goodlookin couple dont they he whispered bending
down and with a jerk of his head in the direction of the
musicians Your brothers a finelookin young chap Mrs
Armstrong And he acts as well as he looks Dont know when Ive
taken such a shine to a young feller as I have to him Yes maam
they make a goodlookin couple even if one of em is my
daughter

The speech was made without the slightest thought or suggestion of
anything but delighted admiration and parental affection
Nevertheless Ruth to whom it was made started slightly and
turning regarded the pair at the piano Maud was fingering the
pages of a book of college songs and looking smilingly up into the
face of Charles Phillips who was looking down into hers There
was apparently nothing in the picturea pretty one by the way
to cause Mrs Armstrong to gaze so fixedly or to bring the slight
frown to her forehead After a moment she turned toward Jed
Winslow Their eyes met and in his she saw the same startled hint
of wonder of possible trouble she knew he must see in hers Then
they both looked away

Captain Hunniwell prated proudly on chanting praises of his
daughters capabilities and talents as he did to any one who would
listen and varying the monotony with occasional references to the
wonderful manner in which young Phillips had taken hold at the
bank Ruth nodded and murmured something from time to time but to
any one less engrossed by his subject than the captain it would
have been evident she was paying little attention Jed who was
being entertained by Babbie and Petunia was absently pretending to
be much interested in a fairy story which the former was
improvisingshe called the process making up as I go alongfor
his benefit Suddenly he leaned forward and spoke

Sam he said theres somebody comin up the walk I didnt get
a good sight of him but it aint anybody that lives here in Orham
regular

Eh That so demanded the captain How do you know taint if
you didnt see him

Cause hes comin to the front door replied Mr Winslow with
unanswerable logic There he is now comin out from astern of
that lilac bush Soldier aint he

It was Ruth Armstrong who first recognized the visitor Why she
exclaimed it is Major Grover isnt it

The major it was and a moment later Captain Hunniwell ushered him
into the room He had come to Orham on an errand he explained
and had stopped at the windmill shop to see Mr Winslow Finding
the latter out he had taken the liberty of following him to the
Hunniwell home

Im going to stay but a moment Captain Hunniwell he went on
I wanted to talk with Winslow on awell on a business matter
Of course I wont do it now but perhaps we can arrange a time
convenient for us both when I can

Dont callate therell be much trouble about that observed the
captain with a chuckle Jed generally has time convenient for
most everybody eh Jed

Jed nodded Umhm he drawled for everybody but Gab Bearse

So you and Jed are goin to talk business eh queried Captain
Sam much amused at the idea Figgerin to have him rig up
windmills to drive those flyin machines of yours Major

Not exactly My business was of another kind and probably not
very important at that I shall probably be over here again on
Monday Winslow Can you see me then

Jed rubbed his chin Yees he said Ill be on private
exhibition to my friends all day And children half price he
added giving Babbie a hug But say Major how in the world did
you locate me today How did you know I was over here to Sams
I never told you I was comin Ill swear to that

For some reason or other Major Grover seemed just a little
embarrassed

Why no he said stammering a trifle you didnt tell me but
some one did Now who

I think I told you Major put in Ruth Armstrong Last evening
when you called toto return Charlies umbrella I told you we
were to dine here today and that JedMr Winslowwas to dine
with us Dont you remember

Grover remembered perfectly then of course He hastened to
explain that having borrowed the umbrella of Charles Phillips the
previous week he had dropped in on his next visit to Orham to
return it

Jed grunted

Humph he said you never came to see me last night When you
was as close aboard as next door seemss if you might

The major laughed Well youll have to admit that I came to
day he said

Yes put in Captain Sam and now you are here youre goin to
stay a spell Oh yes you are too Uncle Sam dont need you so
hard that he cant let you have an hour or so off on Thanksgiving
Day Maud why in time didnt we think to have Major Grover here
for dinner along with the rest of the folks Say couldnt you eat
a plate of frozen puddin right this minute Weve got some on
hand that tastes of my grandfather and we want to get rid of it

Their caller laughingly declined the frozen pudding but he was
prevailed upon to remain and hear Miss Hunniwell play So Maud
played and Charles turned the music for her and Major Grover
listened and talked with Ruth Armstrong in the intervals between
selections And Jed and Barbara chatted and Captain Sam beamed
good humor upon every one It was a very pleasant happy
afternoon War and suffering and heartache and trouble seemed a
long long way off

On the way back to the shop in the chill November dusk Grover told
Jed a little of what he had called to discuss with him If Jeds
mind had been of the supercritical type it might have deemed the
subject of scarcely sufficient importance to warrant the majors
pursuing him to the Hunniwells It was simply the subject of
Phineas Babbitt and the latters antiwar utterances and surmised
disloyalty

You see explained Grover some one evidently has reported the
old chap to the authorities as a suspicious person The
government I imagine isnt keen on sending a special investigator
down here so they have asked me to look into the matter I dont
know much about Babbitt but I thought you might Is he disloyal
do you think

Jed hesitated Things the hardware dealer had said had been
reported to him of course but gossipparticularly the Bearse
brand of gossipwas not the most reliable of evidence Then he
remembered his own recent conversation with Leander and the
latters expressed fear that his father might get into trouble
Jed determined for the sons sake not to bring that trouble
nearer

Well Major he answered I shouldnt want to say that he was
Phineas talks awful foolish sometimes but I shouldnt wonder if
that was his hot head and bull temper as much as anything else As
to whether hes anything more than foolish or not course I
couldnt say sartin but I dont think hes too desperate to be
runnin loose I callate he wont put any bombs underneath the
town hall or anything of that sort Phin and his kind remind me
some of that new kind of balloon you was tellin me theyd probably
have over to your camp when twas done thatererdirigible
wasnt that what you called it

Yes But why does Babbitt remind you of a dirigible balloon I
dont see the connection

Dont you Well seemss if I did Phin fills himself up with
the gas he gets from his Anarchist papers and magazinesthe rich
mans war and all the rest of itand goes up in the air and when
hes up in the air hes kind of hard to handle Thats what you
told me about the balloon if I recollect

Grover laughed heartily Then the best thing to do is to keep him
on the ground I should say he observed

Jed rubbed his chin Umhm he drawled but shuttin off his
gas supply might help some I dont think Id worry about him
much if I was you

They separated at the front gate before the shop where the rows of
empty posts from which the mills and vanes had all been removed
stood as gaunt reminders of the vanished summer Major Grover
refused Jeds invitation to come in and have a smoke

No thank you he said not this evening Ill wait here a
moment and say goodnight to the Armstrongs and Phillips and then I
must be on my way to the camp    Why whats the matter
Anything wrong

His companion was searching in his various pockets The search
completed he proceeded to look himself over so to speak taking
off his hat and looking at that lifting a hand and then a foot and
looking at them and all with a puzzled faraway expression When
Grover repeated his question he seemed to hear it for the first
time and then not very clearly

Eh he drawled Oh whyeryes there IS somethin wrong
That is to say there aint and thats the wrong part of it I
dont seem to have forgotten anything thats the trouble

His friend burst out laughing

I should scarcely call that a trouble he said

Shouldnt you No I presume likely you wouldnt But I never go
anywhere without forgettin somethin forgettin to say somethin
or do somethin or bring somethin Never did in all my life Now
here I am home again and I cant remember that Ive forgot a single
thing    Hum    Well I declare I wonder what it means
Maybe its a sign somethins goin to happen

He said good night absentmindedly Grover laughed and walked away
to meet Ruth and her brother who with Barbara dancing ahead were
coming along the sidewalk He had gone but a little way when he
heard Mr Winslow shouting his name

Major shouted Jed Major Grover Its all right Major I
feel better now Ive found it Twas the key I left it in the
front door lock here when I went away this mornin I guess
theres nothin unnatural about me after all guess nothins goin
to happen

But something did and almost immediately Jed entering the outer
shop closed the door and blundered on through that apartment and
the little shop adjoining until he came to his livingroom beyond
Then he fumbled about in the darkness for a lamp and matchbox He
found the latter first on the table where the lamp should have
been Lighting one of the matches he then found the lamp on a
chair directly in front of the door where he had put it before
going away that morning his idea in so doing being that it would
thus be easier to locate when he returned at night Thanking his
lucky stars that he had not upset both chair and lamp in his
prowlings Mr Winslow lighted the latter Then with it in his
hand he turned to see the very man he and Major Grover had just
been discussing seated in the rocker in the corner of the room and
glaring at him malevolently

Naturally Jed was surprised Naturally also being himself he
showed his surprise in his own peculiar way He did not start
violently nor utter an exclamation Instead he stood stock still
returning Phineas Babbitts glare with a steady unwinking gaze

It was the hardware dealer who spoke first And that by the way
was precisely what he had not meant to do

Yes he observed with caustic sarcasm its me You neednt
stand there blinkin like a fool any longer Shavins Its me

Jed set the lamp upon the table He drew a long breath apparently
of relief

Why so tis he said solemnly When I first saw you sittin
there Phin I had a suspicion twas you but the longer I looked
the more I thought twas the President come to call Do you know
he added confidentially if you didnt have any whiskers and he
looked like you youd be the very image of him

This interesting piece of information was not received with
enthusiasm Mr Babbitts sense of humor was not acutely
developed

Never mind the funny business Shavins he snapped I didnt
come here to be funny tonight Do you know why I came here to
talk to you

Jed pulled forward a chair and sat down

I presume likely you came here because you found the door
unlocked Phin he said

I didnt say HOW I came to come but WHY I came I knew where you
was this afternoon I see you when you left there and I had a good
mind to cross over and say what I had to say before the whole crew
Sam Hunniwell and his stuckup rattlehead of a daughter and that
Armstrong bunch that think themselves so uppish and all of em

Mr Winslow stirred uneasily in his chair Now Phin he
protested seems to me

But Babbitt was too excited to heed His little eyes snapped and
his bristling beard quivered

You hold your horses Shavins he ordered I didnt come here
to listen to you I came because I had somethin to say and when
Ive said it Im goin and goin quick My boys been home You
knew that I suppose didnt you

Jed nodded Yes he said I knew Leanderd come home for
Thanksgivin

Oh you did He came here to this shop to see you maybe Humph
Ill bet he did the poor fool

Again Jed shifted his position His hands clasped about his knee
and his foot lifted from the floor

There there Phin he said gently after all hes your only
son you know

I know it But hes a fool just the same

Now Phin The boyll be goin to war pretty soon you know and

Babbitt sprang to his feet His chin trembled so that he could
scarcely speak

Shut up he snarled Dont let me hear you say that again Jed
Winslow Who sent him to war Who filled his head full of rubbish
about patriotism and duty to the country and all the rest of the
rotten Wall Street stuff Who put my boy up to enlistin Jed
Winslow

Jeds foot swung slowly back and forth

Well Phin he drawled to be real honest I think he put
himself up to it

Youre a liar YOU did it

Jed sighed Did Leander tell you I did he asked

No mockingly Leander didnt tell me You and Sam Hunniwell
and the rest of the gang have fixed him so he dont come to his
father to tell things any longer But he told his stepmother this
very mornin and she told me You was the one that advised him to
enlist he said Good Lord think of it He dont go to his own
father for advice he goes to the town jackass instead the critter
that spends his time whittlin out youngones playthings My Lord
Amighty

He spat on the floor to emphasize his disgust There was an
interval of silence before Jed answered

Well Phin he said slowly youre right in a way Leander
and I have always been pretty good friends and hes been in the
habit of droppin in here to talk things over with me When he
came to me to ask what he ought to do about enlistin asked what
Id do if I was he I told him thats all there was to it

Babbitt extended a shaking forefinger

Yes and you told him to go to war Dont lie out of it now you
know you did

Um    yes    I did

You did You DID And you have the cheek to own up to it right
afore my face

Jeds hand stroked his chin Weell he drawled you just
ordered me not to lie out of it you know Leander asked me right
up and down if I wouldnt enlist if I was in his position
Naturally I said I would

Yes you did And you knew all the time how I felt about it you
SNEAK

Jeds foot slowly sank to the floor and just as slowly he hoisted
himself from the chair

Phin he said with deliberate mildness is there anything else
youd like to ask me Cause if there isnt maybe youd better
run along

You sneakin coward

Erernownow Phin you didnt understand I said ask me
not call me

No I didnt come here to ask you anything I came here and
waited here sos to be able to tell you somethin And that is
that I know now that youre responsible for my sonmy only boy
the boy Id depended onandand

The fierce little man was for the moment close to breaking down
Jeds heart softened he felt almost consciencestricken

Im sorry for you Phineas he said I know how hard it must be
for you Leander realized it too He

Shut up Shavins you listen to me I dont forget All my
life Ive never forgot And I aint never missed gettin square
I can wait just as I waited here in the dark over an hour sos to
say this to you Ill get square with you just as Ill get square
with Sam Hunniwell    Thats all    Thats all   
DAMN YOU

He stamped from the room and Jed heard him stumbling through the
littered darkness of the shops on his way to the front door
kicking at the obstacles he tripped over and swearing and sobbing
as he went It was ridiculous enough of course but Jed did not
feel like smiling The bitterness of the little mans final curse
was not humorous Neither was the heartbreak in his tone when he
spoke of his boy Jed felt no selfreproach he had advised
Leander just as he might have advised his own son had his life been
like other mens lives normal men who had married and possessed
sons He had no sympathy for Phineas Babbitts vindictive hatred
of all those more fortunate than he or who opposed him or for his
silly and selfish ideas concerning the war But he did pity him
he pitied him profoundly

Babbitt had left the front door open in his emotional departure and
Jed followed to close it Before doing so he stepped out into the
yard

It was pitch dark now and still He could hear the footsteps of
his recent visitor pounding up the road and the splashy grumble of
the surf on the bar was unusually audible He stood for a moment
looking up at the black sky with the few stars shining between the
cloud blotches Then he turned and looked at the little house next
door

The windows of the sittingroom were alight and the shades drawn
At one window he saw Charles Phillips silhouette he was reading
apparently Across the other shade Ruths dainty profile came and
went Jed looked and looked He saw her turn and speak to some
one Then another shadow crossed the window the shadow of Major
Grover Evidently the major had not gone home at once as he had
told Jed he intended doing plainly he had been persuaded to enter
the Armstrong house and make Charlie and his sister a short call
This was Jeds estimate of the situation his sole speculation
concerning it and its probabilities

And yet Mr Gabe Bearse had he seen the majors shadow upon the
Armstrong window curtain might have speculated much


CHAPTER XV


The pity which Jed felt for Phineas Babbitt caused him to keep
silent concerning his Thanksgiving evening interview with the
hardware dealer At first he was inclined to tell Major Grover of
Babbitts expressions concerning the war and his sons enlistment
After reflection however he decided not to do so The Winslow
charity was wide enough to cover a multitude of other peoples sins
and it covered those of Phineas The latter was to be pitied as
to fearing him as a consequence of his threat to get square Jed
never thought of such a thing If he felt any anxiety at all in
the matter it was a trifling uneasiness because his friends the
Hunniwells and the Armstrongs were included in the threat But he
was inclined to consider Mr Babbitts wrath as he had once
estimated the speech of a certain Ostable candidate for political
office to be like a tumbler of plain sody water mostly fizz and
froth and nothin very substantial or fillin He did not tell
Grover of the interview in the shop he told no one not even Ruth
Armstrong

Theto him at leastdelightful friendship and intimacy between
himself and his friends and tenants continued He and Charlie
Phillips came to know each other better and better Charles was
now almost as confidential concerning his personal affairs as his
sister had been and continued to be

Its surprising how I come in here and tell you all my private
business Jed he said laughing I dont go about shouting my
joys and troubles in everybodys ear like this Why do I do it to
you

Jed stopped a dismal whistle in the middle of a bar

Weell he drawled I dont know When I was a youngone I
used to like to holler out back of Uncle Laban Ryders barn sos to
hear the echo When you say so and so Charlie I generally agree
with you Maybe you come here to get an echo eh

Phillips laughed Youre not fair to yourself he said I
generally find when the echo in here says no after Ive said yes it
pays me to pay attention to it Sis says the same thing about you
Jed

Jed made no comment but his eyes shone Charles went on

Dont you get tired of hearing the story of my life he asked
I

He stopped short and the smile faded from his lips Jed knew why
The story of his life was just what he had not told what he could
not tell

As January slid icily into February Mr Gabriel Bearse became an
unusually busy person There were so many things to talk about
Among these was one morsel which Gabe rolled succulently beneath
his tongue Charles Phillips cordin to everybodys tell was
keeping company with Maud Hunniwell

There aint no doubt of it declared Mr Bearse All hands is
talkin about it Lookss if Capn Sam would have a soninlaw on
his hands pretty soon How do you callate hed like the idea
Shavins

Jed squinted along the edge of the board he was planing He made
no reply Gabe tried again

How do you callate Capn Samll like the notion of his pet
daughter takin up with another man he queried Jed was still
mute His caller lost patience

Say what ails you he demanded Cant you say nothin

Mr Winslow put down the board and took up another

Yees he drawled

Then why dont you for thunder sakes

Eh    Um   Oh I did

Did what

Say nothin

Oh you divilish idiot Stop tryin to be funny I asked you how
you thought Capn Sam would take the notion of Mauds havin a
steady beau Shes had a good many after her but looks as if she
was stuck on this one for keeps

Jed sighed and looked over his spectacles at Mr Bearse The
latter grew uneasy under the scrutiny

What in time are you lookin at me like that for he asked
pettishly

The windmill maker sighed again WhyerGab he drawled I
was just thinkin likely YOU might be stuck for keeps

Eh Stuck What are you talkin about

Stuck on that box youre sittin on I had the glue pot standin
on that box just afore you came in and    er    it leaks
considerble

Mr Bearse raspingly separated his nether garment from the top of
the box and departed expressing profane opinions Jeds lips
twitched for an instant then he puckered them and began to
whistle

But although he had refused to discuss the matter with Gabriel
Bearse he realized that there was a strong element of probability
in the latters surmise It certainly did look as if the spoiled
daughter of Orhams bank president had lost her heart to her
fathers newest employee Maud had had many admirers some very
earnest and lovelorn swains had hopefully climbed the Hunniwell
front steps only to sorrowfully descend them again Miss Melissa
Busteed and other local scandal scavengers had tartly classified
the young lady as the worst little flirt on the whole Cape which
was not true But Maud was pretty and vivacious and she was not
averse to the society and adoration of the male sex in general
although she had never until now shown symptoms of preference for
an individual But Charlie Phillips had come and seen and judging
by appearances conquered

Since the Thanksgiving dinner the young man had been a frequent
visitor at the Hunniwell home Maud was musical she played well
and had a pleasing voice Charles baritone was unusually good
So on many evenings Captain Sams front parlor rang with melody
while the captain smoked in the big rocker and listened admiringly
and gazed dotingly At the movingpicture theater on Wednesday and
Saturday evenings Orham nudged and winked when two Hunniwells and a
Phillips came down the aisle Even at the Congregational church
where Maud sang in the choir the young bank clerk was beginning to
be a fairly constant attendant Captain Eri Hedge declared that
that settled it

When a young feller who aint been to meetin for land knows how
long observed Captain Eri all of a sudden begins showin up
every Sunday reglar as clockwork you can make up your mind its
owin to one of two reasonseither hes got religion or a girl
In this case there aint any revival in town so

And the captain waved his hand

Jed was not blind and he had seen perhaps sooner than any one
else the possibilities in the case And what he saw distressed
him greatly Captain Sam Hunniwell was his lifelong friend Maud
had been his pet since her babyhood she and he had had many
confidential chats together over troubles at school over petty
disagreements with her father over all sorts of minor troubles and
joys Captain Sam had mentioned to him more than once the
probability of his daughters falling in love and marrying some
time or other but they both had treated the idea as vague and far
off almost as a joke

And now it was no longer far off the falling in love at least
And as for its being a jokeJed shuddered at the thought He was
very fond of Charlie Phillips he had made up his mind at first to
like him because he was Ruths brother but now he liked him for
himself And had things been other than as they were he could
think of no one to whom he had rather see Maud Hunniwell married
In fact had Captain Hunniwell known the young mans record of his
slip and its punishment Jed would have been quite content to see
the latter become Mauds husband A term in prison especially
when as in this case he believed it to be an unwarranted
punishment would have counted for nothing in the unworldly mind of
the windmill maker But Captain Sam did not know He was
tremendously proud of his daughter in his estimation no man would
have been quite good enough for her What would he say when he
learned What would Maud say when she learned for it was almost
certain that Charles had not told her These were some of the
questions which weighed upon the simple soul of Jedidah Edgar
Wilfred Winslow

And heavier still there weighed the thought of Ruth Armstrong He
had given her his word not to mention her brothers secret to a
soul not even to him And yet some day or other as sure and
certain as the daily flowing and ebbing of the tides that secret
would become known Some day Captain Sam Hunniwell would learn it
some day Maud would learn it Better far better that they
learned it before marriage or even before the public announcement
of their engagementalways provided there was to be such an
engagement In fact were it not for Ruth herself no
consideration for Charles feelings would have prevented Jeds
taking the matter up with the young man and warning him that
unless he made a clean breast to the captain and Maud heJed
would do it for him The happiness of two such friends should not
be jeopardized if he could prevent it

But there was Ruth She not her brother was primarily
responsible for obtaining for him the bank position and obtaining
it under fake pretenses And she according to her own confession
to Jed had urged upon Charles the importance of telling no one
Jed himself would have known nothing would have had only a vague
indefinite suspicion had she not taken him into her confidence
And to him that confidence was precious sacred If Charlies
secret became known it was not he alone who would suffer Ruth
too would be disgraced She and Babbie might have to leave Orham
might have to go out of his life forever

No wonder that as the days passed and Gabe Bearses comments and
those of Captain Eri Hedge were echoed and reasserted by the
majority of Orham tongues Jed Winslows worry and foreboding
increased He watched Charlie Phillips go whistling out of the
yard after supper and sighed as he saw him turn up the road in the
direction of the Hunniwell home He watched Mauds face when he
met her and although the young lady was in better spirits and
prettier than he had ever seen her these very facts made him
miserable because he accepted them as proofs that the situation
was as he feared He watched Ruths face also and there too he
saw or fancied that he saw a growing anxiety She had been very
well her spirits like Mauds had been light she had seemed
younger and so much happier than when he and she first met The
little Winslow house was no longer so quiet with no sound of
voices except those of Barbara and her mother There were Red
Cross sewing meetings there occasionally and callers came Major
Grover was one of the latter The majors errands in Orham were
more numerous than they had been and his trips thither much more
frequent in consequence And whenever he came he made it a point
to drop in usually at the windmill shop first and then upon
Babbie at the house Sometimes he brought her home from school in
his car He told Jed that he had taken a great fancy to the little
girl and could not bear to miss an opportunity of seeing her
Which statement Jed of course accepted wholeheartedly

But Jed was sure that Ruth had been anxious and troubled of late
and he believed the reason to be that which troubled him He hoped
she might speak to him concerning her brother He would have liked
to broach the subject himself but feared she might consider him
interfering

One dayit was in late February the ground was covered with snow
and a keen wind was blowing in over a sea graygreen and splashed
thickly with whiteJed was busy at his turning lathe when Charlie
came into the shop Business at the bank was not heavy in mid
winter and although it was but little after three the young man
was through work for the day He hoisted himself to his accustomed
seat on the edge of the workbench and sat there swinging his feet
and watching his companion turn out the heads and trunks of a batch
of wooden sailors He was unusually silent for him merely
nodding in response to Jeds cheerful Hello and speaking but a
few words in reply to a question concerning the weather Jed
absorbed in his work and droning a hymn apparently forgot all
about his caller

Suddenly the latter spoke

Jed he said when you are undecided about doing or not doing a
thing how do you settle it

Jed looked up over his spectacles

Eh he asked Whats that

I say when you have a decision to make and your mind is about
fiftyfifty on the subject how do you decide

Jeds answer was absently given Weell he drawled I
generallyerdont

But suppose the time comes when you have to what then

Eh    Oh then if taint very important I usually leave it
to Isaiah

Isaiah Isaiah who

I dont know his last name but hes got a whole lot of first
ones Thats him up on that shelf

He pointed to a much battered wooden figure attached to the edge of
the shelf upon the wall The figure was that of a little man
holding a set of mill arms in front of him The said mill arms
were painted a robinsegg blue and one was tipped with black

Thats Isaiah continued Jed Hum    yes    thats him
He was the first one of his kind of contraption that I ever made
and bein as he seemed to bring me luck Ive kept him Hes
settled a good many questions for me Isaiah has

Why do you call him Isaiah

Eh Oh thats just his todays name I called him Isaiah just
now cause that was the first of the prophet names I could think
of Next time hes just as liable to be Hosea or Ezekiel or Samuel
or Jeremiah He prophesies just as well under any one of em
dont seem to be particular

Charles smiled slightlyhe did not appear to be in a laughing
moodand then asked You say he settles questions for you How

How    Oh   Well you notice one end of that whirligig
arm hes got is smudged with black

Yes

Thats Hoseas indicator Suppose Ive got somethin onon what
complimentary folks like you would call my mind Suppose same as
twas yesterday mornin I was tryin to decide whether or not Id
have a piece of steak for supper I gaveerElishas whirlagig
here a spin and when the black end stopped twas pintin straight
up That meant yes If it had pinted down twould have meant no

Suppose it had pointed acrosshalf way between yes and no

That would have meant thaterwhatshisnameerDeuteronomy
there didnt know any more than I did about it

This time Phillips did laugh So you had the steak he observed

Jeds lip twitched I bought it he drawled I got so far all
accordin to prophecy And I put it on a plate out in the back
room where twas cold intendin to cook it when supper time came

Well didnt you

Noo you see twas otherwise provided That everlastin Cherub
tomcat of Taylors must have sneaked in with the boy when he
brought the order from the store When I shut the steak up in the
back room Iererhum   

You did what

Eh    Oh I shut the cat up with it I guess likely thats
the end of the yarn aint it

Pretty nearly I should say What did you do to the cat

Hum    Why I let him go Hes a good enough cat cordin to
his lights I guess It must have been a treat to him I doubt if
he gets much steak at home    Well do you want to give Isaiah
a whirl on that decision you say youve got to make

Charles gave him a quick glance I didnt say I had one to make
he replied I asked how you settled such a question thats all

Um    I see    I see Well the prophets at your
disposal Help yourself

The young fellow shook his head Im afraid it wouldnt be very
satisfactory he said He might say no when I wanted him to say
yes you see

Umhm    Hes liable to do that When he does it to me I
keep on spinnin him till we agree thats all

Phillips made no comment on this illuminating statement and there
was another interval of silence broken only by the hum and rasp of
the turning lathe Then he spoke again

Jed he said seriously now when a big question comes up to
you and youve got to answer it one way or the other how do you
settle with yourself which way to answer

Jed sighed Thats easy Charlie he declared There dont any
big questions ever come up to me I aint the kind of feller the
big things come to

Charles grunted impatiently Oh well admitting all that he
said you must have to face questions that are big to you that
seem big anyhow

Jed could not help wincing just a little The matteroffact way
in which his companion accepted the estimate of his insignificance
was humiliating Jed did not blame him it was true of course
but the truth hurta little He was ashamed of himself for
feeling the hurt

Oh he drawled I do have some thingslittle noaccount things
to decide every once in a while Sometimes they bother me too
although they probably wouldnt anybody with a head instead of a
Hubbard squash on his shoulders The only way I can decide em is
to set down and open court put em on trial as you might say

What do you mean

Why I call in witnesses for both sides seems so Heres the
reasons why I ought to tell heres the reasons why I shouldnt
I

Tell Ought to TELL What makes you say that What have YOU got
to tell

He was glaring at the windmill maker with frightened eyes Jed
knew as well as if it had been painted on the shop wall before him
the question in the boys mind the momentous decision he was
trying to make And he pitied him from the bottom of his heart

Tell he repeated Did I say tell Well if I did twas just
aerfigger of speech as the book fellers talk about But the
only way to decide a thing as it seems to me is to try and figger
out whats the RIGHT of it and then do that

Phillips looked gloomily at the floor And thats such an easy
job he observed with sarcasm

The figgerin or the doin

Oh the doing the figuring is usually easy enoughtoo easy But
the doing is different The average fellow is afraid I dont
suppose you would be Jed I can imagine you doing almost anything
if you thought it was right and hang the consequences

Jed looked aghast Who Me he queried Good land of love
dont talk that way Charlie Im the scarest critter that lives
and the weakestkneed too most generally Butbut all the
same I do believe the best thing and the easiest in the end not
only for youor mebut for all hands is to take the bull by the
horns and heave the critter if you can There may be an awful big
trouble but big or little itll be over and done with THAT bull
wont be hangin around all your life and sneakin up astern to get
youand those youercare for    Mercy me how I do preach
Theyll be callin me to the Baptist pulpit if I dont look out
I understand theyre candidatin

His friend drew a long breath There is a poem that I used to
read or hear some one read he observed that fills the bill for
any one with your point of view I should say Something about a
fellows not being afraid to put all his money on one horse or the
last cardabout his not deserving anything if he isnt afraid to
risk everything Wish I could remember it

Jed looked up from the lathe


 He either fears his fate too much
 Or his deserts are small
 Who dares not put it to the touch
 To win or lose it all


Thats somethin like it aint it Charlie he asked

Phillips was amazed Well I declare Winslow he exclaimed
you beat me I cant place you at all Whoever would have
accused you of reading poetryand quoting it

Jed rubbed his chin I dont know much of course he said but
theres considerble many poetry books up to the library and I like
to read em sometimes Youre liable to run across aerpoem
well like this one for instancethat kind of gets hold of you
It fills the bill you might say as nothin else does Theres
another one thats better still About


 Once to every man and nation
 Comes the moment to decide


Do you know that one

His visitor did not answer After a moment he swung himself from
the workbench and turned toward the door

He either fears his fate too much he quoted gloomily
Humph I wonder if it ever occurred to that chap that there might
be certain kinds of fate that COULDNT be feared too much   
Well so long Jed Ah hum you dont know where I can get hold of
some money do you

Jed was surprised Humph he grunted I should say you HAD
hold of money twothirds of every day Feller that works in a bank
is supposed to handle some cash

Yes of course with an impatient laugh but that is somebody
elses money not mine I want to get some of my own

Sho    Well I callate I could let you have ten or twenty
dollars right now if that would be any help to you

It wouldnt thank you just the same If it was five hundred
instead of ten whyperhaps I shouldnt say no

Jed was startled

Five hundred he repeated Five hundred dollars Do you need
all that so very bad Charlie

Phillips his foot upon the threshold of the outer shop turned and
looked at him

The way I feel now Id do almost anything to get it he said and
went out

Jed told no one of this conversation although his friends parting
remark troubled and puzzled him In fact it troubled him so much
that at a subsequent meeting with Charles he hinted to the latter
that he should be glad to lend the five hundred himself

I ought to have that and some more in the bank he said Sam
would know whether I had or not    Eh Why and you would
too of course I forgot you know as much about folks bank
accounts as anybody    Moren some of em do themselves
bashfulness stoppin me from namin any names he added

Charles looked at him Do you mean to tell me Jed Winslow he
said that you would lend me five hundred dollars without any
security or without knowing in the least what I wanted it for

Whywhy of course Twouldnt be any of my business what you
wanted it for would it

Humph Have you done much lending of that kind

Eh    Um    Well I used to do considerble but Sam he
kind of put his foot down and said I shouldnt do any more But I
dont HAVE to mind him you know although I generally do because
its easierand less noisy he added with a twinkle in his eye

Well you ought to mind him hes dead right of course Youre a
good fellow Jed but you need a guardian

Jed shook his head sadly I hate to be so unpolite as to call
your attention to it he drawled but Ive heard somethin like
that afore Up to now I aint found any guardian that needs me
thats the trouble And if I want to lend you five hundred
dollars Charlie Im goin to Oh Im a divil of a feller when I
set out to be desperate and reckless I am

Charlie laughed but he put his hand on Jeds shoulder Youre a
brick I know that he said and Im a million times obliged to
you But I was only joking I dont need any five hundred

Eh    You dont    Why you said

Oh Ierneed some new clothes and things and I was talking
foolishness thats all Dont you worry about me Jed Im all
right

But Jed did worry a little although his worry concerning the
young mans need of money was so far overshadowed by the anxiety
caused by his falling in love with Maud Hunniwell that it was
almost forgotten That situation was still as tense as ever Two
thirds of Orham so it seemed to Jed was talking about it
wondering when the engagement would be announced and speculating
as Gabe Bearse had done on Captain Sams reception of the news
The principals Maud and Charles did not speak of it of course
neither did the captain or Ruth Armstrong Jed expected Ruth to
speak he was certain she understood the situation and realized its
danger she appeared to him anxious and very nervous It was to
him and to him aloneher brother exceptedshe could speak but
the days passed and she did not And it was Captain Hunniwell who
spoke first


CHAPTER XVI


Captain Sam entered the windmill shop about two oclock one windy
afternoon in the first week of March He was wearing a heavy fur
overcoat and a motoring cap He pulled off the coat threw it over
a pile of boards and sat down

Whew he exclaimed Its blowing hard enough to start the bark
on a log

Jed looked up

Did you say log or dog he asked solemnly

The captain grinned I said log he answered This gale of
wind would blow a dog away bark and all Whew Im all out of
breath Its some considerble of a drive over from Wapatomac
Comin across that stretch of marsh road by West Ostable I didnt
know but the little flivver would turn herself into a flyin
machine and go up

Jed stopped in the middle of the first note of a hymn

What in the world sent you autoin way over to Wapatomac and back
this day he asked

His friend bit the end from a cigar Oh diggin up the root of
all evil he said I had to collect a note that was due over
there

Humph I dont know much about such things but I never
mistrusted twas necessary for you to go cruisin like that to
collect notes Seems considerble like sendin the skipper up town
to buy onions for the cook Couldnt thethe feller that owed the
money send you a check

Captain Sam chuckled He could I callate but he wouldnt he
observed Twas old Sylvester Sage up to South Wapatomac the
cranberry king they call him up there He owns cranberry bogs
from one end of the Cape to the other Youve heard of him of
course

Jed rubbed his chin Maybe so he drawled but if I have Ive
forgot him The only sage I recollect is the sage tea Mother used
to make me take when I had a cold sometimes I COULDNT forget
that

Well everybody but you has heard of old Sylvester Hes the
biggest crank on earth

Humm Seems s if he and I ought to know each other    But
maybe hes a different kind of crank eh

Hes all kinds One of his notions is that he wont pay bills by
check if he can possibly help it Hell travel fifty miles to pay
money for a thing sooner than send a check for it He had this
notefourteen hundred dollars twascomin due at our bank today
and hed sent word if we wanted the cash we must send for it cause
his lumbago was too bad for him to travel I wanted to see him
anyhow about a little matter of a political appointment up his
way so I decided to take the car and go myself Well Ive just
got back and I had a windy vyage too And cold dont talk

Um    yes    Get your money did you

Yes I got it Its in my overcoat pocket now I thought one
spell I wasnt goin to get it for the old feller was mad about
some one of his cranberry buyers failin up on him and he was as
crossgrained as a scrub oak root He and I had a regular row over
the matter of politics I went there to see him about special I
told him what he was and he told me where I could go Thats how
we parted Then I came home

Hum    Youd have had a warmer trip if youd gone where he
sent you I presume likely    Um    Yes yes   


 Theres a place in this chorus
 For you and for me
 And the theme of it ever
 And always shall be
 Hallelujah tis done
 I believe   


Hum    I thought that paint can was full and there aint
moren a half pint in it I must have drunk it in my sleep I
guess Do I look green around the mouth Sam

It was just before Captain Sams departure that he spoke of his
daughter and young Phillips He mentioned them in a most casual
fashion as he was putting on his coat to go but Jed had a feeling
that his friend had stopped at the windmill shop on purpose to
discuss that very subject and that all the detail of his Wapatomac
trip had been in the nature of a subterfuge to conceal this fact

Oh said the captain with somewhat elaborate carelessness as he
struggled into the heavy coat I dont know as I told you that the
directors voted to raise Charlies salary Umhm at last
Saturdays meetin they did it Twas unanimous too Hes as
smart as a whip that young chap We all think a heap of him

Jed nodded but made no comment The captain fidgeted with a
button of his coat He turned toward the door stopped cleared
his throat hesitated and then turned back again

Jed he said hashas it seemed to you thatthat hethat
Charlie wasmaybecomin to think considerble ofof my
daughterof Maud

Jed looked up caught his eye and looked down again Captain Sam
sighed

I see he said You dont need to answer I presume likely the
whole town has been talkin about it for land knows how long Its
generally the folks at home that dont notice till the last gun
fires Of course I knew he was comin to the house a good deal and
that he and Maud seemed to like each others society and all that
But it never struck me thatthat it meant anything serious you
knowanythinganythingwell you know what I mean Jed

Yes Yes Sam I suppose I do

Yes Well II dont know why it never struck me either If
Georgiannaif my wife had been alive shed have noticed Ill
bet but I didnt Twas only last evenin when he came to get
her to go to the pictures that it came across me you might say
likelike a wet cold ropes end slappin me in the face I give
you my word Jed II kind of shivered all over She meansshe
means somethin to me that little girl andand

He seemed to find it hard to go on Jed leaned forward

I know Sam I know he said His friend nodded

I know you do Jed he said I dont think theres anybody else
knows so well Im glad Ive got you to talk to I callate
though he added with a short laugh if some folks knew I came
here toto talk over my private affairs theyd think I was goin
soft in the head

Jed smiled and there was no resentment in the smile

Theyd locate the softness in tother head of the two Sam he
suggested

I dont care where they locate it I can talk to you about things
I never mention to other folks Guess it must be because youyou
well I dont know but its so anyhow    Well to go ahead
after the young folks had gone I sat there alone in the parlor in
the dark tryin to think it out The housekeeper had gone over to
her brothers so I had the place to myself I thought and thought
and the harder I thought the lonesomer the rest of my life began to
look And yetand yet I kept tellin myself how selfish and
foolish that was I knew twas a dead sartinty shed be gettin
married some time You and I have laughed about it and joked about
it time and again And Ive joked about it with her too But
but jokins one thing and this was another    Whew

He drew a hand across his forehead Jed did not speak After a
moment the captain went on

Well he said when she got home and after hed gone I got
Maud to sit on my knee same as shes done ever since she was a
little girl and she and I had a talk I kind of led up to the
subject as you might say and by and by wewell we talked it out
pretty straight She thinks an awful sight of him Jed There
aint any doubt about that she as much as told me in those words
and more than told me in other ways And hes the only one shes
ever cared two straws for she told me that Andandwell I
think she thinks he cares for her that way too although of course
she didnt say so But he hasnt spoken to her yet I dont know
butbut it seemed to me maybe that he might be waitin to speak
to me first Im hiserboss you know and perhaps he may feel
a littlelittle under obligations to me in a business way and that
might make it harder for him to speak Dont it seem to you maybe
that might be it Jed

Poor Jed hesitated Then he stammered that he shouldnt be
surprised Captain Sam sighed

Well he said if thats it it does him credit anyhow I
aint goin to be selfish in this thing Jed If shes goin to
have a husbandand she is of courseI callate Id rather twas
Charlie than anybody else Ive ever run across Hes smart and
hell climb pretty high I callate Our little singlesticked
bankin craft aint goin to be big enough for him to sail in very
long I can see that already Hell be navigatin a clipper one
of these days Well thats the way Id want it Im pretty
ambitious for that girl of mine and I shouldnt be satisfied short
of a topnotcher And hes a GOOD feller Jed a straight clean
honest and aboveboard young chap Thats the best of it after
all aint it

Jeds reply was almost a groan but his friend did not notice He
put on his overcoat and turned to go

So there you are he said I had to talk to somebody had to
get it off my chest and as I just said it seems to be easier to
talk such things to you than anybody else Now if any of the town
gas enginesGab Bearse or anybody elsecomes cruisin in here
heavin overboard questions about how I like the notion of Maud and
Charlie takin up with each other you can tell em Im tickled to
death That wont be all lie neither I cant say Im happy
exactly but Maud is and Im goin to makebelieve be for her
sake So long

He went out Jed put his elbows on the workbench and covered his
face with his hands He was still in that position when Ruth
Armstrong came in He rose hastily but she motioned him to sit
again

Jed she said Captain Hunniwell was just here with you I saw
him go Tell me what was he talking about

Jed was confused Whywhy Mrs Ruth he stammered he was
just talkin aboutabout a note hed been collectin andand
such

Wasnt he speaking of his daughterandand my brother

This time Jed actually gasped Ruth drew a long breath I knew
it she said

Butbut for mercy sakes HOW did you know Did he

No he didnt see me at all I was watching him from the window
But I saw his face and with a sudden gesture of desperation
Oh it wasnt that at all Jed It was my guilty conscience I
guess Ive been expecting him to speak to youor mehave been
dreading it every dayand now somehow I knew he had spoken I
KNEW it What did he say Jed

Jed told the substance of what Captain Sam had said She listened
When he finished her eyes were wet

Oh it is dreadful she moaned II was so hoping she might
not care for Charlie But she doesof course she does She
couldnt help it with a sudden odd little flash of loyalty

Jed rubbed his chin in desperation

Andand Charlie he asked anxiously Does he

Yes yes Im sure he does He has never told me so never in so
many words but I can see I know him better than any one else in
the world and I can see I saw first I think on Thanksgiving
Day at least that is when I first began to suspectto fear

Jed nodded When they was at the piano together that time and Sam
said somethin about their bein a finelookin couple he said

Why yes that was it Are you a mind reader Jed

Noo I guess not But I saw you lookin kind of surprised and
erwell scared for a minute I was feelin the same way just
then so it didnt need any mind reader to guess what had scared
you

I see But oh Jed it is dreadful What SHALL we do What
will become of us all And now when II had just begun to be
happy really happy

She caught her breath in a sob Jed instinctively stretched out
his hand

But there she went on hurriedly wiping her eyes I mustnt do
this This is no time for me to think of myself Jed this
mustnt go any further He must not ask her to marry him he must
not think of such a thing

Jed sadly shook his head Im afraid youre right he said
Not as things are now he surely mustnt Butbut Mrs Ruth

Oh dont impatiently Dont use that silly Mrs any longer
Arent you thethe best friend I have in the world Do call me
Ruth

If she had been looking at his face just then she might have seen
things But she was not looking There was an interval of silence
before he spoke

Well thenerRuth he faltered

Thats right Go on

I was just goin to ask you if you thought Charlie was callatin
to ask her I aint so sure that he is

He told of Charles recent visit to the windmill shop and the young
mans query concerning the making of a decision She listened
anxiously

But dont you think that means that he was wondering whether or
not he should ask her she said

No That is I dont think its sartin sure it means that I
rather had the notion it might mean he was figgerin whether or not
to go straight to Sam and make a clean breast of it

You mean telltell everything

Yes all about thethe business at Middleford I do honestly
believe thats what the boys got on his mind to do It aint very
surprisin that he backs and fills some before that minds made up
See what it might mean to him it might mean the loss of his
prospects here and his place in the bank and moren everything
else losin Maud Its some decision to make If I had to make
it I Well I dont know

She put her hand to her eyes The POOR boy she said under her
breath But Jed DO you think that is the decision he referred
to And why hasnt he said a word to me his own sister about it
Im sure he loves me

Sartin he does and thats just it as I see it It aint his own
hopes and prospects alone that are all wrapped up in this thing
its yoursand Babbies Hes troubled about whatll happen to
you Thats why he hasnt asked your advice I believe

They were both silent for a moment Then she said pleadingly
Oh Jed it is up to you and me isnt it What shall we do

It was the we in this sentence which thrilled If she had bade
him put his neck in front of the handsaw just then Jed would have
obeyed and smilingly have pulled the lever which set the machine
in motion But the question nevertheless was a staggerer

Weell he admitted II hardly know what to say I will give
in To be right down honestand the Lord knows I hate to say it
it wouldnt do for a minute to let those two young folks get
engagedto say nothin of gettin marriedwith this thing between
em It wouldnt be fair to her nor to Samno nor to him or
you either You see that dont you he begged You know I
dont say it for any reason but justjust for the best interests
of all hands You know that dont youRuth

Of course of course But what then

I dont really know what then Seems to me the very first thing
would be for you to speak to him put the question right up to him
same as hes been puttin it to himself all this time Get him to
talk it over with you And thenwell then

Yes

Oh I dont know I declare I dont

Suppose he tells me he means to marry her in spite of everything
Suppose he wont listen to me at all

That possibility had been in Jeds mind from the beginning but he
refused to consider it

He will listen he declared stoutly He always has hasnt he

Yes yes I suppose he has He listened to me when I persuaded
him that coming here and hiding allall that happened was the
right thing to do And now see what has come of it And it is all
my fault Oh I have been so selfish

Sshh sshh You aint you couldnt be if you tried And
besides I was as much to blame as you I agreed that twas the
best thing to do

Oh reproachfully how can you say that You know you were
opposed to it always You only say it because you think it will
comfort me It isnt true

Eh Nownow dont talk so Please dont If you keep on
talkin that way Ill do somethin desperate start to make a
johnny cake out of sawdust same as I did yesterday mornin or
somethin else crazy

Jed

Its true that about the johnny cake I came pretty nigh doin
that very thing I bought a fivepound bag of corn meal yesterday
and fetched it home from the store all done up in a nice neat
bundle Comin through the shop here I had it under my arm and
humerwell to anybody else it couldnt have happened but
bein Jed Shavins Winslow I was luggin the thing with the top of
the bag underneath I got about abreast of the lathe there when
the string came off and in lessn two thirds of a shake all I had
under my arm was the bag the meal was on the floorwhat wasnt in
my coat pocket and stuck to my clothes and so on I fetched the
water bucket and started to salvage what I could of the cargo
Pretty soon I had as nigh as I could reckon it about fourteen
pound out of the five scooped up and in the bucket I begun to
think the miracle of loaves and fishes was comin to pass again I
was some shy on fish but I was makin up on loaves Then I sort
of looked matters over and found what I had in the bucket was about
one pound of meal to seven of sawdust Then I gave it up Seemed
to me the stuff might be more fillin than nourishin

Ruth smiled faintly Then she shook her head

Oh Jed she said youre as transparent as a windowpane Thank
you though If anything could cheer me up and help me to forget I
think you could

Jed looked repentant Id no business to tell you all that
rigamarole he said Im sorry Im always doin the wrong
thing seems so But he added earnestly I dont want you to
worry too much about your brothererRuth Its goin to come
out all right I know it God wont let it come out any other
way

She had never heard him speak in just that way before and she
looked at him in surprise

And yet God permits many things that seem entirely wrong to us
humans she said

I know Things like the Kaiser for instance Well never mind
this ones goin to come out all right I feel it in my bones
And with a return of his whimsical drawl I may be short on
brains but a blind man could see they never skimped me when they
passed out the bones

She looked at him a moment Then suddenly leaning forward she
put her hand upon his big red one as it lay upon the bench

Jed she said earnestly what should I do without you You are
my one present help in time of trouble I wonder if you know what
you have come to mean to me

It was an impulsive speech made from the heart and without
thought of phrasing or that any meaning other than that intended
could be read into it A moment later and without waiting for an
answer she hurried from the shop

I must go she said I shall think over your advice Jed and I
will let you know what I decide to do Thank you ever and ever so
much

Jed scarcely heard her After she had gone he sat perfectly still
by the bench for a long period gazing absently at the bare wall of
the shop and thinking strange thoughts After a time he rose and
walking into the little sittingroom sat down beside the ugly
little oak writing table he had bought at a secondhand sale and
opened the upper drawer

Weeks before Ruth yielding to Babbies urgent appeal had
accompanied the latter to the studio of the local photographer and
there they had been photographed together and separately The
results although not artistic triumphs being most inexpensive
had been rather successful as likenesses Babbie had come trotting
in to show Jed the proofs A day or so later he found one of the
said proofs on the shop floor where the little girl had dropped it
It happened to be a photograph of Ruth sitting alone

And then Jed Winslow did what was perhaps the first dishonest thing
he had ever done He put that proof in the drawer of the oak
writing table and said nothing of his having found it Later he
made a wooden frame for it and covered it with glass It faded and
turned black as all proofs do but still Jed kept it in the drawer
and often very often opened that drawer and looked at it Now he
looked at it for a long long time and when he rose to go back to
the shop there was in his mind along with the dream that had been
there for days and weeks for the first time the faintest dawning
of a hope Ruths impulsive speech hastily and unthinkingly made
was repeating itself over and over in his brain I wonder if you
know what you have come to mean to me What had he come to mean
to her

An hour later as he sat at his bench Captain Hunniwell came
banging in once more But this time the captain looked troubled

Jed he asked anxiously have you found anything here since I
went out

Jed looked up

Eh he asked absently Found What have you found Sam

I I havent found anything Ive lost four hundred dollars
though You havent found it have you

Still Jed did not appear to comprehend He had been wandering the
rosebordered paths of fairyland and was not eager to come back to
earth

Eh he drawled Youvewhat

His friends peppery temper broke loose

For thunder sakes wake up he roared I tell you Ive lost four
hundred dollars of the fourteen hundred I told you I collected from
Sylvester Sage over to Wapatomac this mornin I had three
packages of bills two of five hundred dollars each and one of four
hundred The two five hundred packages were in the inside pocket
of my overcoat where I put em But the four hundred ones gone
What I want to know is did it drop out when I took off my coat
here in the shop Do you get that through your head finally

It had gotten through Jed now looked as troubled as his friend
He rose hastily and went over to the pile of boards upon which
Captain Sam had thrown his coat upon entering the shop on his
previous visit that day Together they searched painstakingly and
at length The captain was the first to give up

Taint here he snapped I didnt think twas Where in time
is it Thats what I want to know

Jed rubbed his chin

Are you sure you had it when you left Wapatomac he asked

Sure No I aint sure of anything But Id have sworn I did
The money was on the table along with my hat and gloves I picked
it up and shoved it in my overcoat pocket And that was a darned
careless place to put it too he added testily Id have given
any feller that worked for me the devil for doin such a thing

Jed nodded sympathetically But you might have left it there to
Sylvesters he said Have you thought of telephonin to find
out

Have I thought Tut tut tut Do you think Ive got a head like
a sixyearold youngoneor you Course Ive thoughtand
phoned too But it didnt do me any good Sylvesters house is
shut up and the old mans gone to Boston so the postmaster told me
when I phoned and asked him Wont be back for a couple of days
anyhow I remember he told me he was goin

Sho sho thats too bad

Bad enough but I dont think it makes any real difference I
swear I had that money when I left Sages I came in here and then
I went straight to the bank

And after you got there

Oh when I got there I found no less than three men not countin
old Mrs Emmeline Bartlett in my room waitin to see me Nellie
Hallmy typewriter you knowshe knew where Id been and what a
crank old Sage is and she says Did you get the money Capn
And I says Yes its in my overcoat pocket this minute Then I
hurried in to tend to the folks that was waitin for me Twas an
hour later afore I went to my coat to get the cash Then as I
say all I could find was the two five hundred packages The four
hundred one was gone

Sho sho Tut tut tut Where did you put the coat when you
took it off

On the hook in the clothes closet where I always put it

Humm Anderwhen you told Nellie about it did you speak
loud

Loud No loudern I ever do

Wellerthat aint aerwhisper Sam exactly

Dont make any difference There wasnt anybody outside the
railin that minute to hear if Id bellered like a bull of Bashan
There was nobody in the bank I tell you except the three men and
old Aunt Emmeline and they were waitin in my private room And
except for Nellie and Eddie Ellis the messenger and Charlie
Phillips there want a soul around as it happened The money
hasnt been stolen I lost it somewheresbut where Well I cant
stop here any longer Im goin back to the bank to have another
hunt

He banged out again Fortunately he did not look at his friends
face before he went For that face had a singular expression upon
it Jed sat heavily down in the chair by the bench A vivid
recollection of a recent remark made in that very shop had suddenly
come to him Charlie Phillips had made it in answer to a question
of his own Charlie had declared that he would do almost anything
to get five hundred dollars


CHAPTER XVII


The next morning found Jed heavyeyed and without appetite going
through the form of preparing breakfast All night with the
exception of an hour or two he had tossed on his bed alternately
fearing the worst and telling himself that his fears were
groundless Of course Charlie Phillips had not stolen the four
hundred dollars Had not he Jed Winslow loudly proclaimed to
Ruth Armstrong that he knew her brother to be a fine young man one
who had been imprudent it is true but much more sinned against
than sinning and who would henceforth so he was willing to swear
be absolutely upright and honest Of course the fact that a sum of
money was missing from the Orham National Bank where Phillips was
employed did not necessarily imply that the latter had taken it

Not necessarily that was true but Charlie had in Jeds presence
expressed himself as needing money a sum approximately that which
was missing and he had added that he would do almost anything to
get it Andthere was no use telling oneself that the fact had no
bearing on the case because it would bear heavily with any
unprejudiced personCharlies record was against him Jed loyally
told himself over and over again that the boy was innocent he KNEW
he was innocent But The dreadful but came back again and
again to torment him

All that day he went about in an alternate state of dread and hope
Hope that the missing four hundred might be found dread ofmany
possibilities Twice he stopped at the bank to ask Captain Sam
concerning it The second time the captain was a trifle impatient

Gracious king Jed he snapped Whats the matter with you
Taint a million This institutionll probably keep afloat even
if it never turns up And twill turn up sooner or later its
bound to Theres a chance that I left it at old Sages Soons
the old cuss gets back and I can catch him by telephone Ill find
out Meanwhile I aint worryin and I dont know why you should
The main thing is not to let anybody know anythings missin Once
let the news get out twill grow to a hundred thousand afore night
Therell be a run on us if Gab Bearse or Melissa Busteed get goin
with their throttles open So dont you whisper a word to anybody
Jed Well find it pretty soon

And Jed did not whisper a word But he anxiously watched the
inmates of the little house watched Charles face when he came
home after working hours watched the face of his sister as she
went forth on a marketing expedition even scrutinized Babbies
laughing countenance as she came dancing into the shop swinging
Petunia by one arm And it was from Babbie he first learned that
in spite of all Captain Hunniwells precautions some one had
dropped a hint It may as well be recorded here that the identity
of that some one was never clearly established There were
suspicions centering about the bank messenger but he stoutly
denied having told a living soul

Barbara who was on her way home from school and had rescued the
longsuffering Petunia from the front fence where she had been left
suspended on a picket to await her parents return was bubbling
over with news and giggles

Oh Uncle Jed she demanded jumping up to perch panting upon a
stack of the front elevations of birdhouses isnt Mr Gabe Bearse
awfully funny

Jed sighed Yes he said Gabes as funny as a jumpin
toothache

The young lady regarded him doubtfully I see she said after a
moment youre joking again I wish youd tell me when youre
going to do it so Petunia and I would know for sure

All right Ill try not to forget to remember But how did you
guess I was jokin this time

Cause you just had to be A jumping toothache isnt funny I
had one once and it made me almost sick

Umhm Weell Gabe Bearse makes most everybody sick What
set you thinkin about him

Cause I just met him on the way home and he acted so funny
First he gave me a stick of candy

Mr Winslow leaned back in his chair

What he cried He gave you a stick of candy GAVE it to you

Yes He said Here little girl dont you like candy And
when I said I did he gave me a stick the striped peppermint kind
it was Id have saved a bite for you Uncle Jed only I and the
rest ate it all before I remembered Im awfully sorry

Thats all right Striped candy dont agree with me very well
anyway Im liable to swallow the stripes crossways I guess
likely But tell me did Gabe look wild or out of his head when he
gave it to you

Why no He just lookedohoh you know Uncle JedMYSterous
thats how he looked MYSterous

Hum Well Im glad to know he want crazy Ive known him a
good many years and this is the first time I ever knew him to GIVE
anybody anything worth while When I went to school with him he
gave me the measles I remember but even then they was only
imitationthe German kind And now hes givin away candy Tut
tut No wonder he lookedwhat was itmysterious    Hum   
Well he wanted somethin for it didnt he What was it

Why he just wanted to know if Id heard Uncle Charlie say
anything about a lot of money being gone up to the bank He said
he had heard it was ever and ever so mucha hundred hundred
dollarsor a thousand dollars or somethingI dont precactly
remember but it was a great big lot And he wanted to know if
Uncle Charlie had said how much it was and what had become of it
andand everything When I said Uncle Charlie hadnt said a word
he looked so sort of disappointed and funny that it made me laugh

It did not make Jed laugh The thought that the knowledge of the
missing money had leaked out and was being industriously spread
abroad by Bearse and his like was very disquieting He watched
Phillips more closely than before He watched Ruth and before
another day had passed he had devised a wonderful plan a plan to
be carried out in case of alarming eventualities

On the afternoon of the third day he sat before his workbench his
knee clasped between his hands his foot swinging and his thoughts
busy with the situation in all its alarming phases It had been
bad enough before this new development bad enough when the always
present danger of Phillips secret being discovered had become
complicated by his falling in love with his employers daughter
But now Suppose the boy had stolen the money Suppose he was
being blackmailed by some one whom he must pay or face exposure
Jed had read of such things they happened often enough in novels

He did not hear the door of the outer shop open A month or more
ago he had removed the bell from the door His excuse for so doing
had been characteristic

I cant stand the wear and tear on my morals he told Ruth I
aint sold anything except through the mail since the winter
really set in And yet every time that bell rings I find myself
jumpin up and runnin to wait on a customer When it turns out to
be Gabe Bearse or somebody like him I swear and swearin to me is
like whiskey to some folkscomfortin but demoralizin

So the bell having been removed Jed did not hear the person who
came into and through the outer shop The first sign of that
persons presence which reached his ears was an unpleasant chuckle
He turned to see Mr Phineas Babbitt standing in the doorway of
the inner room Andthis was the most annoying and disturbing
fact connected with the sightthe hardware dealer was not
scowling he was laughing The Winslow foot fell to the floor with
a thump and its owner sat up straight

He he he chuckled Phineas Jed regarded him silently
Babbitts chuckle subsided into a grin Then he spoke

Well he observed with sarcastic politeness hows the great
Shavins Jedidah the famous inventor of whirlagigs He he he

Jed slowly shook his head Phin he said either you wear
rubbers or Im gettin deaf one or the other How in the world
did you get in here this time without my hearin you

Phineas ignored the question He asked one of his own Hows the
only original high and mighty patriot this afternoon he sneered

The Winslow hand caressed the Winslow chin

If you mean me Phin drawled Jed Im able to sit up and take
nourishment thank you I judge you must be kind of ailin
though Take a seat wont you

No I wont Ive got other fish to fry bigger fish than you at
that

Umhm Well they wouldnt have to be sperm whales to beat me
Phin Be kind of hard to fry em if they was too big wouldnt
it

Theyre goin to fry you hear me Yes and theyre goin to
sizzle He he he

Mr Winslow sadly shook his head You must be awful sick Phin
he drawled Thats the third or fourth time youve laughed since
you came in here

His visitor stopped chuckling and scowled instead Jed beamed
gratification

Thats it he said Now you look more natural Feelin a
little better    eh

The Babbitt chin beard bristled Its wearer leaned forward

Shut up he commanded I aint takin any of your sass this
afternoon Shavins and I aint callatin to waste much time on
you neither You know where Im bound now Well Im bound up to
the Orham National Bank to call on my dear friend Sam Hunniwell
He he he Ive got a little bit of news for him Hes in
trouble they tell me and I want to help him out    Blast
him

This time Jed made no reply but he too leaned forward and his
gaze was fixed upon the hardware dealers face There was an
expression upon his own face which when Phineas saw it caused the
latter to chuckle once more

He he he laughed Whats the matter Shavins You look kind
of scared about somethin Taint possible youve known all along
what Ive just found out I wonder if you have Have you

Still Jed was silent Babbit grunted

It dont make any difference whether you have or not he said
But if you aint I wonder what makes you look so scared Theres
nothin to be scared about as I see Im just callatin to do
our dear old chummie Capn Sam a kindness thats all Hes lost
some money up there to the bank I understand Some says its four
thousand dollars and some says its forty It dont make any
difference that part dont Whatever tis its missin and Im
going to tell him where to find it Thats real good of me aint
it Aint it Shavins eh

The little mans malignant spite and evident triumph were actually
frightening And it was quite evident that Jed was frightened
Yet he made an effort not to appear so

Yes he agreed Yes yes seems s if twas Erer Where
is it Phin

Phineas burst out laughing Where is it Phin he repeated
mockingly By godfreys mighty I believe you do know where tis
Shavins You aint gettin any of it are you You aint
dividin up with the blasted jailbird

Jed was very pale His voice shook as he essayed to speak

Whwhat jailbird he faltered What do you mean Whatwhat
are you talkin about Phin

What are you talkin about Phin God sakes hear him will
you All right Ill tell you what Im talkin about Im talkin
about Sam Hunniwells pet his new bookkeeper up there to the bank
Im talkin about that stuckup thievin hypocrite of a Charlie
Phillips thats who Im talkin about I called him a jailbird
didnt I Well he is Hes served his term in the Connecticut
States prison for stealin And I know it

Jed groaned aloud Here it was at last The single hair had
parted and the sword had fallen And now of all times now He
made a pitiful attempt at denial

It aint so he protested

Oh yes it is so Six or eight weeks agoin January twas
there was a drummer in my store sellin a line of tools and he was
lookin out of the window when this Phillips cuss went by with Maud
Hunniwell both of em struttin along as if common folks honest
folks was dirt under their feet And when this drummer see em he
swore right out loud Why says he thats Charlie Phillips of
Middleford aint it His names Phillips and he comes from
Connecticut somewheres says I I thought he was in states
prison says he What do you mean says I And then he told
me By godfreys says I if you can fix it sos I can prove
thats true Ill give you the biggest order you ever got in this
store Twont be any trouble to prove it says he All
youve got to do is look up his record in Middleford And Ive
looked it up Yes siree Ive looked it up Ho ho

Jed white and shaking made one more attempt

Its all a lie he cried Of course it is Besides if you
knew so much why have you been waitin all this time before you
told it If you found out all thisthis pack of rubbish in
January why did you wait till March before you told it Humph
Thats pretty thin I

Phineas interrupted

Shut up he ordered Why did I wait Well now Shavins
seein its you and I love you so Ill tell you At first I was
for runnin right out in the street and hollerin to all hands to
come and hear the good news about Sam Hunniwells pet And then
thinks I Hold on dont be in any hurry Theres time enough
Just wait and see what happens A crook that steals once is liable
to try it again Lets wait and see And I waited and He
he hehe has tried it again Eh Shavins

Jed was speechless Babbitt looking like a triumphantly vicious
Bantam rooster crowed on

You dont seem to be quite so sassy and talky as you was when I
first came in Shavins he sneered Guess likely YOU aint
feelin well now    eh Do you remember what I told you last
time I was in this shop I told you Id pay my debts to you and
Sam Hunniwell if I waited fifty year Well heres Hunniwells pay
comin to him now Hes praised that Phillips thief from one end
of Ostable county to the other told how smart he was and how
honest and good he was tillLord Amighty its enough to turn a
decent mans stomach And not only that but heres the feller
courtin his daughter Oh ho ho ho thats the best of the
whole business That was another thing made me hang off and wait
I wanted to see how the courtin came along And its come along
all right Everybodys onto em hangin over each other and
lookin soft at each other Shes just fairly heavin herself at
his head all hands says so There aint been anybody in this town
good enough for her till he showed up And now its comin out
that hes a crook and a jailbird And hell be jailed for stealin
THIS time too Ho ho

He stopped out of breath to indulge in another long chuckle Jed
leaned forward

What are you talkin about Phin he demanded Even allowin
all thisthis rigmarole of yours aboutabout Middleford business
was true

It is true and you know it is I believe youve known it all
along

I say allowin it is you havent any right to say Charlie took
this money from the Orham bank You cant prove any such thing

Aw be still Proveprove nothin When a cat and a sasser of
milks shut up together and the milks gone you dont need proof
to know where its gone do you Dont talk to me about proof Jed
Winslow Put a thief alongside of money and anybody knows whatll
happen Why YOU know whats happened yourself You know darn
well Charlie Phillips has stole the money thats gone from the
bank Down inside you youre sartin sure of it and I dont want
any better proof of THAT than just your face Shavins

This time Jed did not attempt to contradict Instead he tried a
new hazard

Phin he pleaded dont be too hard Just think of whatll
happen if you come out with thatthat wildgoose yarn of yours
Think of Maud poor girl You havent got anything against her
have you

Yes I have Shes stuckup and nose in the air and looks at me
as if I was some sort ofof a bug she wouldnt want to step on for
fear of mussin up her shoes I never did like her blast her
But leavin that all to one side shes Sam Hunniwells youngone
and thats enough for me

But shes his only child Phin

Good enough I had a boy he was an only child too youll
remember Where is he now Out somewheres where he dont belong
fightin and bein killed to help Wall Street get rich And who
sent him there Why Sam Hunniwell and his gang Youre one of
em Jed Winslow To hell with you every one of you daughters
and all hands

But Phinjust a minute Think of what itll mean to Charlie
poor young feller Itll mean

Itll mean ten years this time and a good job too You poor
fool do you think you can talk me out of this You you sawdust
head What do you think I came into your hole here for I came
here sos youd know what I was goin to do to your precious chums
I wanted to tell you and have the fun of watchin you squirm
Well Im havin the fun plenty of it Squirm you Wall Street
bloodsucker squirm

He fairly stood on tiptoe to scream the last command To a
disinterested observer the scene might have had some elements of
farce comedy Certainly Phineas his hat fallen off and under
foot his scanty gray hair tousled and his pugnacious chin beard
bristling was funny to look at And the idea of calling Jed
Winslow a Wall Street bloodsucker was the cream of burlesque
But to Jed himself it was all tragedy deep and dreadful He made
one more desperate plea

But Phin he begged think of hishis sister Charlies
sister Whatll become of her andand her little girl

Phineas snorted His sister he sneered All right Ill think
about her all right Shes another stuckup that dont speak to
common folks Who knows anything about her any moren they did
about him Better look up her record I guess The boys turned
out to be a thief maybe the sisterll turn out to be

Stop Be still

Jed actually shouted it Babbitt stopped principally because the
suddenness of the interruption had startled him into doing so But
the pause was only momentary He stared at the interrupter in
enraged amazement for an instant and then demanded Stop Who are
you tellin to stop

You

I want to know Well Ill stop when I get good and ready and if
you dont like it Shavins you can lump it That Phillips kid
has turned out to be a thief and so far as anybody round here
knows his sister may be

Stop Again Jed shouted it and this time he rose to his feet
Phineas glared at him

Humph he grunted Youll make me stop I presume likely

Yes

Is that so

Yes its got to be so Look here Phin I realize youre mad and
dont care much what you say but theres a limit you know Its
bad enough to hear you call poor Charlie names but when you start
in on Ruthon Mrs Armstrong I meanthats too much Youve got
to stop

This speech was made quietly and with all the customary Winslow
deliberation and apparent calm but there was one little slip in it
and that slip Babbitt was quick to notice

Oh my he sneered Ruths what we call her eh Ruth Got so
chummy we call each other by our first names Ruthie and Jeddie I
presume likely Aw haw haw

Jeds pallor was for the moment succeeded by a vivid crimson He
stammered Phineas burst into another scornful laugh

Haw haw haw he crowed She lets him call her Ruth Oh my
Lord Amighty Lets Shavins Winslow call her that Well I
guess I sized her up all right She must be about on her brothers
level A thief and

Shut up Phin

Shut up YOU tell me to shut up

Yes

Well I wont Ruth Armstrong What do I care for

The speech was not finished Jed had taken one long stride to
where Babbitt was standing seized the furious little creature by
the right arm with one hand and with the other covered his open
mouth covered not only the mouth but a large section of face as
well

You keep quiet Phin he drawled I want to think

Phineas struggled frantically He managed to get one corner of his
mouth from behind that mammoth hand

Ruth Armstrong he screamed Ruth Armstrong is

The yell died away to a gurgle pinched short by the Winslow
fingers Then the door leading to the kitchen the door behind the
pair opened and Ruth Armstrong herself came in She was pale and
she stared with frightened eyes at the little man struggling in the
tall ones clutch

Oh Jed she breathed what is it

Jed did not reply Phineas could not

Oh Jed what is it repeated Ruth I heard him shouting my
name I was in the yard and I heard it    Oh Jed what IS
it

Babbitt at last managed to wriggle partially clear He was crazy
with rage but he was not frightened Fear of physical violence
was not in his makeup he was no coward

Ill tell you what it is he screamed Ill tell you what it
is Ive found out about you and that stuckup crook of a brother
of yours Hes a thief Thats what he is a thief and a
jailbird He stole at Middleford and now hes stole again here
And Jed Winslow and you are

He got no further being once more stoppered like a bottle by the
Winslow grip and the Winslow hand He wriggled and fought but he
was pinned and helpless hands feet and vocal organs Jed did not
so much as look at him he looked only at Ruth

Her pallor had increased She was trembling

Oh Jed she cried what does he mean What does he mean byby
againhere

Jeds grip tightened over his captives mouth

He doesnt mean anything he declared stoutly He dont know
what he means

From behind the smothering fingers came a defiant mumble Ruth
leaned forward

Jed she begged does hedoes he know aboutabout

Jed nodded She closed her eyes and swayed slightly but she did
not collapse or give way

And he is going to tell she whispered

A furious mumble from behind the fingers and a venomous flash from
the Babbitt eyes were answers sufficient

Oh Jed she pleaded what SHALL we do

For the instant a bit of the old Jed came to the surface His lip
twitched grimly as he looked down at the crimson face above his own
hand

I aint sartinyet he drawled How do you start in killin
aa snappin turtle I aint tackled the job since I was a boy

Phineas looked as if he could have furnished some points on the
subject His eyes were bulging Then all three heard the door of
the outer shop open

Ruth looked desperately about her She hastened to the door by
which she had entered Theres some one coming she whispered

Jed glanced over his shoulder You go away he whispered in
reply Go away Ruth Hurry

Her hand was on the latch of the door but before she could open it
the other door that leading from the outer shop opened and
Leonard Grover came in He stared at the picture before himat
Ruth Armstrongs pale frightened face at Babbitt struggling in
his captors clutch at Jed

Why he exclaimed What is it

No one answered Phineas was the only one who stirred He seemed
anxious to turn the tableau into a moving picture but his success
was limited The Major turned to Ruth

What is it he asked again

She was silent Grover repeated his question addressing Jed this
time

Well he asked sharply What is the trouble here What has
that fellow been doing

Jed looked down at his wriggling captive Heshes he
stammered Well you see Major he    Hum    well Im
afraid I cant tell you

You cant tell me What on earth Mrs Armstrong will you tell
me

She looked at him appealingly pitifully but she shook her head

II cant she said

He looked from one to the other Then with a shrug he turned to
the door

Pardon me for interrupting he observed Good afternoon

It was Ruth who detained him Oh please she cried involuntarily
He turned again

You wish me to stay he asked

Ohoh I dont know I

She had not finished the sentence she was falteringly trying to
finish it when Mr Babbitt took the center of the stage Once more
he managed to free himself from Jeds grip and this time he darted
across the shop and put the workbench between himself and his enemy

Ill tell you what it is he screamed Ive found out some
things they dont want anybody to know thats what Ive found
out what sort of folks they are she and her brother Hes a
common Let go of me By

The scream ended in another mumble Jed had swarmed over the bench
and once more pinned him fast

Youll have to excuse me Major he panted II cant help it
This fellers got what ailed the parrothe talks too darn much
Hes got to stop Hes GOT to

But Grover was paying little attention He was looking at Ruth

Mrs Armstrong he asked has he been sayingsaying things he
should not say about you Is that the trouble

She answered without returning his look

Yes she said almost in a whisper About me andand my
Yes that was it

The Majors eyes flashed Let go of him Jed he commanded Jed
hesitated

If I do hell blow up again he said

Let go of him

Jed let go Phineas caught his breath and opened his mouth Major
Grover stepped in front of him and leveled a forefinger straight at
the crimson Babbitt nose

Stop he ordered sharply

Stop What right have you got to tell me to stop By

Stop Listen to me I dont know what youve been saying about
this lady

I aint been saying anything except what I know and that is
that

Stop And I dont care But I know about you sir because it is
my business to know The Government has had its eye on you for
some time and it has asked me to look into your record I have
looked into it You are not a very dangerous person Mr Babbitt
but that is because of your lack of ability to harm not because of
any good will on your part toward the United States You have done
all the harm you could you have talked sedition youve written
and talked against the draft you have corresponded with German
agents in Boston and New York

Thats a lie

No its the truth I have copies of your letters and the
Government has the originals They are not very dangerous but
that is because you are not big enough to be dangerous The
authorities have left you pretty much to my discretion sir It
rests with me whether to have you taken in charge and held for
trial or merely to warn you and watch you Very well I warn you
now and you may be certain that you are watched Youll stop your
silly seditious talk at once and youll write no more letters like
those I have seen If you do it will be a prison term for you as
sure as I stand here Do you understand

Apparently Phineas understood His face was not as red as it had
been and there was a different look in his eye Jeds rough
handling had not frightened him but the Majors cold incisive
tones and the threat of a term in prison had their effect
Nevertheless he could still bluster

You cant talk to me that way he sputtered II aint scared
of you even if you are all dressed up in fuss and feathers like a
handorgan monkey This is a free country

Yes it is For decent people it is absolutely free The other
sort have to be put where they cant interfere with that freedom
Whether you Babbit remain free or not depends entirely upon what
you doand say Is this perfectly clear

Phineas did not answer the question directly For a moment he
stood there his fists clenching and unclenching and his eyes
snapping Then he turned away

All right he said sullenly I hear what you say Now I can
go I presume likelyunless youve got some more lyin and
bullyin to do Get out of my way Shavins you fool

But Grover had not finished with him

Just a minute he said There is one thing more I dont know
what it is and I dont wish to know but evidently you have been
saying or threatening to say something concerning this lady Mrs
Armstrong which should not be said You are not to mention her
name Do you understand that

The little hardware dealer almost jumped from the floor as his rage
again got the better of him

The blazes I aint he shrieked Who says I aint Is that any
of your business MrMr Brass Monkey Whats you or the United
States govment got to say about my mentionin names To the devil
with the United States and you too You hear that

Major Grover smiled Yes he said quietly I hear it So
does Mr Winslow here and Mrs Armstrong They can be called as
witnesses if it is necessary You had better let me finish
Babbitt As I say you are not to mention Mrs Armstrongs name
you are not to repeat or circulate any scandal or story reflecting
upon her character

Or her brothers either put in Jed eagerly Tell him he cant
talk against Charlie either

Certainly You are not to repeat or circulate anything derogatory
to the character of either Mrs Armstrong or Mr Phillips In any
way derogatory

Phineas tossed both fists in the air

You cant order me around that way he yelled Besides if you
knew what I know about that gang youd

Hush I dont want to know anything you knowor pretend to know
As for ordering you aboutwell well see

I tell you you cant You aint got the right

Perhaps not But I have the right to use my discretionmy
judgment in your case And my judgment is that if I hear one
scandalous story about town reflecting upon the character of Mrs
Armstrong or her brotheryes or her friendsI shall know who is
responsible and I shall have you arrested and held for trial as an
enemy of the country You condemned the United States to the devil
only a moment ago in my hearing Do you think that would help you
in court Babbitt I dont

The little mans face was a sight As Jed said afterward he
looked as if he would have enjoyed biting his way out of the shop

Huh he snarled I see Youre all in together the whole lot
of you And you you brass buttons youre usin your soldierin
job to keep your friends out of trouble    Huh Yes thats
what youre doin

The Majors smile was provokingly cool

Perhaps I am he admitted But I shouldnt advise you to forget
what I have just told you Babbitt I mean every word of it

It was Ruth who spoke next She uttered a startled exclamation

Theres some one coming up the walk she cried Listen

Sure enough heavy footsteps sounded upon the walk leading from the
front gate to the shop Jed ran to the window

Its Sam he exclaimed Good heavens above Its Sam Hunniwell
of all folksnow

Grover looked from one face to the other

Is there any particular reason why Captain Hunniwell shouldnt
come he asked

Jed and Ruth were silent Phineas chuckled malevolently Jed
heard the chuckle and spoke

Twastwas Capn Sam he was goin to tell he whispered
pointing at Babbitt Ruth caught her breath with a frightened
gasp

Grover nodded Oh I see he said Well I dont think he
will Hell be moremorecareful Im sure Babbitt remember

They heard the captain rattle the latch of the front door Ruth
opened the door behind her I must go Jed she whispered
II cant stay

The Major turned Ill go with you Mrs Armstrong he said
But Jed leaned forward

II wish youd stay Major Grover he whispered IId like
to have you stay here just a minute or two

Grover hesitated Ruth went out closing the livingroom door
after her A moment later Captain Sam came into the workshop

Hello Jed he hailed Why hello Major What Then for
the first time he saw and recognized the third member of the group
He looked at Phineas and the little man looked at him The looks
were studies in expression

Humph grunted Captain Sam What in time    Humph   
Well Phin you look awful glad to see me I must say Gracious
king man dont glower at me like that I havent done anything
to you if youd only have sense enough to believe it

Babbitt did not answer He looked as if he were going to burst
Major Grover was regarding him with a whimsical twinkle in his eye

Mr Babbitt and I have just been discussing some points connected
with the war he observed I dont know that we agree exactly
but we havewell we have reached an understanding

The captain was plainly puzzled Humph he grunted You dont
say    Well I Eh what is it Jed

If any one had been watching Jed particularly during the recent few
minutes they might have observed in his face the dawning of an idea
and the changing of that idea into a set purpose The idea seemed
to dawn the moment after he saw Captain Hunniwell coming up the
walk It had become a purpose by the time the captain rattled the
latch While Captain Sam and the major were speaking he had
hastened to the old desk standing by the wall and was rummaging in
one of the drawers Now he came forward

Sam he began but broke off to address Mr Babbitt who was
striding toward the door Dont go Phin he cried Id rather
you didnt go just this minute Id like to have you stay Please

Phineas answered over his shoulder The answer was a savage snarl
and a command for Shavings to mind his own business Grover
spoke then

Mr Babbitt he suggested dont you think you had better stay a
moment Mr Winslow seems to wish it

Babbitt reached for the handle of the door but Grovers hand was
lightly laid on his shoulder

Do stay Mr Babbitt begged the Major sweetly To oblige me
you know

Phineas swore with such vehemence that the oath might have been
heard across the road What he might have said thereafter is a
question At that moment his attention was caught by something
which Jed Winslow had in his hands and he stayed to stare at it
The something was a bundle of crumpled banknotes



CHAPTER XVIII


Jed came forward the roll of bills in his hand He seemed quite
oblivious of the Babbitt stare or for that matter of the
complete silence which had so suddenly fallen upon the group in the
shop He came forward smoothing the crumpled notes with fingers
which shook a little He stopped in front of Captain Hunniwell
The captain was gazing at him and at the money Jed did not meet
his friends eye he continued to smooth the banknotes Captain
Sam spoke first

Whats that he demanded What moneys that

Jeds fingers moved back and forth across the bills and he answered
without looking up He seemed much embarrassed

Sam he faltered Sameryou remember you told me youder
lost some money a spell ago Someermoney youd collected over
to Wapatomac You remember that dont you

Captain Sam looked at him in puzzled surprise Remember it he
repeated Course I remember it Gracious king taint likely
Id forget it is it

Jed nodded Noo he drawled solemnly No course you
couldnt Twas four hundred dollars you was short want it

The Captains puzzled look was still there

Yes he replied What of it

Whywhy just this Sam II want it to be plain you
understand I want Major Grover and Phineas here to understand
thethe whole of it Theres a lot of talk seems so around town
about money bein missin from the bank

Captain Sam interrupted The deuce there is he exclaimed
Thats the first Ive heard of any such talk Whos talkin

Oh aa good many folks I judge likely Gabe Bearse asked
Babbie about it and Phin here he

Eh The captain turned to face his old enemy So youve been
talkin have you he asked

Mr Babbitt leaned forward I aint begun my talkin yet Sam
Hunniwell he snarled When I do youll

He stopped Grover had touched him on the shoulder

Sshh said the Major quietly To the absolute amazement of
Captain Sam Phineas subsided His face was blazing red and he
seemed to be boiling inside but he did not say another word Jed
seized the opportunity to continue

II just want to get this all plain Sam he put in hastily
I just want it so all handsll understand it thats all You
went over to Sylvester Sages in Wapatomac and he paid you four
hundred dollars When you got back home here fourteen hundred of
it was missin No no I dont mean that I mean you couldnt
find fourteen hundredI mean

The captains patience was as he himself often said moored with a
short cable The cable parted now

Gracious king he snapped Jed if that yarn youre tryin to
spin was wound in a ball and a kitten was playin with it you
couldnt be worse snarled up What hes tryin to tell you he
explained turning to Grover is that the other day when I was
over to Wapatomac old Sylvester Sage over there paid me fourteen
hundred dollars in cash and when I got back here all I could find
was a thousand Thats what youre tryin to say aint it
turning to Jed once more

Yesyes thats it Sam Thats it

Course its it But what do you want me to say it for And what
are you runnin around with all that money in your hands for
Thats what I want to know

Jed swallowed hard Well Sam he stammered thatthats what
I was goin to tell you You seeyou see thats the four hundred
you lost II found it

Major Grover looked surprised Phineas Babbitt looked more
surprised But oddly enough it was Captain Sam Hunniwell who
appeared to be most surprised by his friends statement The
captain seemed absolutely dumbfounded

Youyou WHAT he cried

Jed smoothed the bills in his hand I found it Sam he
repeated Here tishere

He extended the bundle of banknotes The captain made no move to
take them Jed held them a little nearer

Youyoud better take it Sam he urged It might get lost
again you know

Still Captain Sam made no move He looked from the bills in Jeds
hands to Jeds face and back again The expression on his own face
was a strange one

You found it he repeated YOU did

Yesyes I found it Sam Just happened to

Where did you find it

Over yonder behind that pile of boards You know you said the
money was in your overcoat pocket andand when you came in here on
your way back from Sylvesters you hove your coat over onto those
boards I presume likely thethe money must have fell out of the
pocket then You see dont you Sam

The tone in which the question was asked was one almost of
pleading He appeared very very anxious to have the captain
see But the latter seemed as puzzled as ever

Heres the money Sam urged Jed Take it wont you

Captain Sam took it but that is all he did He did not count it
or put it in his pocket He merely took it and looked at the man
who had given it to him

Jeds confusion seemed to increase Dont youdont you think
youd better count it Sam he stammered Ifif the Major here
and Phin see you count it andand know its all right then
theyll be able to contradict the stories thats goin around about
so much bein stolen you know

The captain grunted

Stolen he repeated You said folks were talkin about money
bein lost Have they been sayin twas stolen

It was Grover who answered I havent heard any such rumors he
said I believe Lieutenant Rayburn said he heard some idle report
about the banks having lost a sum of money but there was no hint
at dishonesty

Captain Sam turned to Mr Babbitt

YOU havent heard any yarns about money bein stolen at the bank
have you he demanded

Before Phineas could answer Grovers hand again fell lightly on his
shoulder

Im sure he hasnt observed the Major The captain paid no
attention to him

Have you he repeated addressing Babbitt

The little man shook from head to foot The glare with which he
regarded his hated rival might have frightened a timid person But
Captain Sam Hunniwell was distinctly not timid

Have you he asked for the third time

Phineas mouth opened but Grovers fingers tightened on his
shoulder and what came out of that mouth was merely a savage
repetition of his favorite retort None of your darned business

Yes tis my business began Captain Sam but Jed interrupted

I dont see as it makes any difference whether hes heard anything
or not Sam he suggested eagerly No matter what hes heard it
aint so because there couldnt have been anything stolen There
was only four hundred missin Ive found that and youve got it
back so that settles it dont it

It certainly would seem as if it did observed Grover
Congratulations Captain Hunniwell Youre fortunate that so
honest a man found the money I should say

The captain merely grunted The odd expression was still on his
face Jed turned to the other two

ErerMajor Grover he said ifif you hear any yarns now
about money bein missinoror stolen you can contradict em
now cant you

I certainly canand will

And youll contradict em too eh Phin

Babbitt jerked his shoulder from Grovers grasp and strode to the
door

Let me out of here he snarled Im goin home

No one offered to detain him but as he threw open the door to the
outer shop Leonard Grover followed him

Just a moment Babbitt he said Ill go as far as the gate
with you if you dont mind Good afternoon Jed Good afternoon
Captain and once morecongratulations    Here Babbitt wait
a moment

Phineas did not wait but even so his pursuer caught him before he
reached the gate Jed who had run to the window saw the Major
and the hardware dealer in earnest conversation The former seemed
to be doing most of the talking Then they separated Grover
remaining by the gate and Phineas striding off in the direction of
his shop He was muttering to himself and his face was working
with emotion Between baffled malice and suppressed hatred he
looked almost as if he were going to cry Even amid his own
feelings of thankfulness and relief Jed felt a pang of pity for
Phineas Babbitt The little man was the incarnation of spite and
envy and vindictive bitterness but Jed was sorry for him just as
he would have been sorry for a mosquito which had bitten him He
might be obliged to crush the creature but he would feel that it
was not much to blame for the bite both it and Phineas could not
help being as they werethey were made that way

He heard an exclamation at his shoulder and turned to find that
Captain Sam had also been regarding the parting at the gate

Humph grunted the captain Phin looks as if hed been eatin
somethin that didnt set any too good Whats started him to
obeyin orders from that Grover man all to once I always thought
he hated soldierin worse than a hen hates a swim    Humph   
Well thats the second queerest thing Ive run across today

Jed changed the subject or tried to change it

Whats the first one Sam he hastened to ask His friend looked
at him for an instant before he answered

The first one he repeated slowly Well Ill tell you Jed
The first oneand the queerest of allis your findin that four
hundred dollars

Jed was a good deal taken aback He had not expected an answer of
that kind His embarrassment and confusion returned

Whywhy he stammered isis that funny Sam I dontI
dont knows I get what you mean Whatswhat is there funny
about my findin that money

The captain stepped across the shop pulled forward a chair and
seated himself Jed watched him anxiously

II dont see anything very funny about my findin that money
Sam he said again Captain Sam grunted

Dont you he asked Well maybe my sense of humors gettin
crosseyed oror somethin I did think I could see somethin
funny in it but most likely I was mistaken Sit down Jed and
tell me all about how you found it

Jed hesitated His hand moved slowly across his chin

Well now Sam he faltered there aint nothin to tell I
justerfound it thats all    Say you aint seen that new
gull vane of mine lately have you I got her so she can flop her
wings pretty good now

Hang the gull vane I want to hear how you found that money
Gracious king man you dont expect Im goin to take the gettin
back of four hundred dollars as cool as if twas ten cents do you
Sit down and tell me about it

So Jed sat not with eagerness but more as if he could think of no
excuse for refusing His companion tilted back in his chair lit a
cigar and bade him heave ahead

Well began Jed IIyou see Sam I happened to look behind
that heap of boards there and

What made you think of lookin behind those boards

Eh Why nothin special I just happened to look Thats
where your coat was you know So I looked andand there twas

I see There twas eh Where

Whywhy behind the boards I told you that you know

Gracious king course I know Youve told me that no less than
ten times But WHERE was it On the boards On the floor

Eh    Oh    oh seems to me twas on the floor

Dont you KNOW twas on the floor

Why    why yes sartin

Then what made you say seems as if it was there

Oh    oh I dont know Land sakes Sam what are you askin
me all these questions for

Just for fun I guess Im interested naturally Tell me some
more How was the moneyall together or kind of scattered round

Eh    Oh all together

Sure of that

Course Im sure of it I can see it just as plain as day now I
come to think of it Twas all together in a heap like

Umhm The band that was round it had come off then

Band What band

Why the paper band with 400 on it That had come off when it
fell out of my pocket I presume likely

Yes    Yes I guess likely it did Must have    Er
Sam let me show you that gull vane I got it so now that

Hold on a minute Im mighty interested about your findin this
money Its soso sort of unexpected as you might say If that
band came off it must have broke when the money tumbled down behind
the boards Lets see if it did

He rose and moved toward the pile of boards Jed also rose

What are you goin to look for he asked anxiously

Why the paper band with the 400 on it Id like to see if it
broke    Humph he added peering down into the dark crevice
between the boards and the wall of the shop Cant see anything
of it can you

Jed peering solemnly down shook his head No he said I
cant see anything of it

But it may be there for all that He reached down Humph he
exclaimed I cant touch bottom Jed youve got a longer arm
than I have lets see if you can

Jed sprawled upon the heap of lumber stretched his arm as far as
it would go Hum he drawled I cant quite make it Sam   
Theres a place where she narrows way down here and I cant get my
fingers through it

Is that so Then wed better give up lookin for the band I
callate Didnt amount to anything anyhow Tell me more about
what you did when you found the money You must have been
surprised

Eh    Land sakes I was I dont knows I ever was so
surprised in my life Thinks I Heres Sams money thats missin
from the bank Yes sir and twas too

Well Im much obliged to you Jed I surely am And when you
found it Lets see you found it this mornin of course

Eh Whywhy howwhat makes you think I found it this mornin

Oh because you must have Cause if youd found it yesterday or
the day before youd have told me right off

Yesoh yes thats so Yes I found it this mornin

Hadnt you thought to hunt for it afore

Eh    Land sakes yes    yes Id hunted lots of times
but I hadnt found it

Hadnt thought to look in that place eh

Thats it    Say Sam what

Its lucky you hadnt moved those boards If youd shifted them
any since I threw my coat on em you might not have found it for a
month not till you used up the whole pile Lucky you looked afore
you shifted the lumber

Yes    yes thats so Thats a fact But Sam hadnt you
better take that money back to the bank The folks up there dont
know its been found yet Theyll be some surprised too

So they will All handsll be surprised And when I tell em how
you happened to see that money lyin in a pile on the floor behind
those boards and couldnt scarcely believe your eyes and couldnt
believe em until youd reached down and picked up the money and
counted it Thats about what you did I presume likely eh

Yes    Yes thats just it

Theyll be surprised then and no wonder But theyd be more
surprised if I should bring em here and show em the place where
you found it Twould surprise most anybody to know that there
was a man livin who could see down a black crack four foot deep
and two inches wide and around a corner in that crack and see money
lyin on the floor and know twas money and then stretch his arm
out a couple of foot more and thin his wrist down until it was less
than an inch through and pick up that money That WOULD surprise
em Dont you think twould Jed

The color left Jeds face His mouth fell open and he stared
blankly at his friend The latter chuckled

Dont you think twould surprise em Jed he repeated Seems
likely as if twould It surprised me all right enough

The color came surging back Jeds cheeks flamed He tried to
speak but what he said was not coherent nor particularly
intelligible

Nownownow Sam he stammered II You dont understand
You aint got it right II

The captain interrupted Dont try so hard Jed he continued
Take time to get your steam up Youll bust a biler if you puff
that way Lets see what it is I dont understand You found this
money behind those boards

Eh Yes    yes    but

Wait And you found it this mornin

Yes    yes    but Sam

Hold on You saw it layin on the floor at the bottom of that
crack

Wellwell I dont know as I saw it exactly butbut No I
didnt see it II felt it

Oh you felt it Thought you said you saw it Well you reached
down and felt it then How did you get your arm stretched out
five foot long and threequarters of an inch thick Put it under
the steam roller did you

Jed swallowed twice before replying II he began Well
well come to think of it Sam II guess I didnt feel it with my
fingers II took a stick Yes that was it I poked in behind
there with a stick

Oh you felt it with a stick And knew twas money Tut tut
You must have a good sense of touch Jed to know bills when you
scratch across em with the far end of a five foot stick Pick em
up with a stick too did you

Mr Winslow was speechless Captain Sam shook his head

And that aint the most astonishin part either he observed
While those bills were in the dark at the bottom of that crack
they must have sprouted They went in there nothin but tens and
twenties These you just gave me are fives and twos and all sorts
Youd better poke astern of those boards again Jed The roots
must be down there yet all youve scratched up are the sprouts

His only answer was a hopeless groan Captain Sam rose and
walking over to where his friend sat with his face buried between
his hands laid his own hand on the latters shoulder

There there Jed he said gently I beg your pardon Im
sorry I stirred you up this way Twas mean of me I know but
when you commenced givin me all this rigmarole I couldnt help it
You never was meant for a liar old man you make a mighty poor
fist at it What is it all about What was you tryin to do it
for

Another groan The captain tried again

Whats the real yarn he asked What are you actin this way
for Course I know you never found the money Is there somebody

No No no Jeds voice rose almost to a shout He sprang to
his feet and clutched at Captain Sams coatsleeve No he
shouted Course there aint anybody Whwhat makes you say such
a thing as that II tell you I did find the money I didI
did

Jed Of course you didnt I know you didnt I KNOW Gracious
king man be sensible

I did I did I found it and now I give it back to you What
more do you want Sam Hunniwell Aint that enough

Enough Its a darned sight too much I tell you I know you
didnt find it

But I did

Rubbish In the first place you and I hunted every inch behind
those boards the very day the money was missin and twant there
then And besides this isnt the money I lost

Wellwell what if taint I dont care II know taint
II spent your money

You SPENT it When You told me you only found it this mornin

II know I did but twant so II Jed was in an agony of
alarm and frantic haste I found your money two or three days
ago Yes sir thats when I found it    Er   er   

Humph Why didnt you tell me you found it then If youd found
it what made you keep runnin into the bank to ask me if ID found
it Why didnt you give it back to me right off Oh dont be so
ridiculous Jed

II aint Its true II didnt give it back to you because
because II thought first Id keep it

Keep it KEEP it Steal it do you mean

Yesyes thats what I mean II thought first Id do that and
then I gotgot kind of sorry andand scared and I got some more
moneyand now Im givin it back to you See dont you Sam
Thats the reason

Captain Sam shook his head So you decided to be a thief did
you Jed he said slowly Well the average person neverd have
guessed you was such a desperate character    Humph   
Well well    What was you goin to do with the four hundred
provided you had kept it You spent the money I lost anyway you
said you did What did you spend it for

Ohoh some things I needed

Sho Is that so What things

Jeds shaking hand moved across his chin

OhII forget he faltered Then after a desperate struggle
III bought a suit of clothes

The effort of this confession was a peculiar one Captain Sam
Hunniwell put back his head and roared with laughter He was still
laughing when he picked up his hat and turned to the door Jed
sprang from his seat

Eh    Youre not GOIN are you Sam he cried The
captain wiping his eyes turned momentarily

Yes Jed he said chokingly Im goin Say ifif you get
time some of these days dress up in that four hundred dollar suit
you bought and then send me word Id like to see it

He went out The door of the outer shop slammed Jed wiped the
perspiration from his forehead and groaned helplessly and
hopelessly

The captain had reached the gate when he saw Phillips coming along
the road toward him He waited until the young man arrived

Hello Captain hailed Charles So you decided not to come back
to the bank this afternoon after all

His employer nodded Yes he said Ive been kept away on
business Funny kind of business too Say Charlie he added
suppose likely your sister and you would be too busy to see me for
a few minutes now Id like to see if youve got an answer to a
riddle

A riddle

Umhm Ive just had the riddle sprung on me and its got MY head
whirlin like a bottle in a tide rip Can I come into your house
for a minute and spring it on you

The young man looked puzzled which was not surprising but his
invitation to come into the house was most cordial They entered
by the front door As they came into the little hall they heard a
mans voice in the livingroom beyond It was Major Grovers voice
and they heard the major say

It doesnt matter at all Please understand I had no thought of
asking I merely wanted you to feel that what that fellow said had
no weight with me whatever and to assure you that I will make it
my business to see that he keeps his mouth shut As for the other
question Ruth

Ruth Armstrongs voice broke in here

Oh please she begged not now II am so sorry I cant tell
you everything butbut it isnt my secret andand I cant
Perhaps some day But please believe that I am grateful very
very grateful I shall never forget it

Charlie with an anxious glance at Captain Hunniwell cleared his
throat loudly The captains thoughts however were too busy with
his riddle to pay attention to the voices in the livingroom As
he and Phillips entered that apartment Major Grover came into the
hall He seemed a trifle embarrassed but he nodded to Captain
Sam exchanged greetings with Phillips and hurried out of the
house They found Ruth standing by the rear window and looking out
toward the sea

The captain plunged at once into his story He began by asking
Mrs Armstrong if her brother had told her of the missing four
hundred dollars Charles was inclined to be indignant

Of course I havent he declared You asked us all to keep
quiet about it and not to tell a soul and I supposed you meant
just that

Eh So I did Charlie so I did Beg your pardon boy I might
have known youd keep your hatches closed Well heres the yarn
Mrs Armstrong It dont make me out any too everlastin
brilliant A grown man that would shove that amount of money into
his overcoat pocket and then go sasshayin from Wapatomac to Orham
aint the kind Id recommend to ship as cow steward on a cattle
boat to say nothin of president of a bank But confessins good
for the soul they say even if it does make a feller feel like a
fool so here goes I did just that thing

He went on to tell of his trip to Wapatomac his interview with
Sage his visit to the windmill shop his discovery that four
hundred of the fourteen hundred had disappeared Then he told of
his attempts to trace it of Jeds anxious inquiries from day to
day and finally of the scene he had just passed through

So there you are he concluded I wish to mercy youd tell me
what it all means for I cant tell myself If it hadnt been so
so sort of pitiful and if I hadnt been so puzzled to know what
made him do it I callate Id have laughed myself sick to see poor
old Jed tryin to lie Why he aint got the first notion of how
to begin I dont callate he ever told a real upanddown lie
afore in his life That was funny enoughbut when he began to
tell me he was a thief Gracious king And all he could think of
in the way of an excuse was that he stole the four hundred to buy a
suit of clothes with Ho ho ho

He roared again Charlie Phillips laughed also But his sister
did not laugh She had seated herself in the rocker by the window
when the captain began his tale and now she had drawn back into the
corner where the shadows were deepest

So there you are said Captain Sam again Theres the riddle
Now whats the answer Why did he do it Can either of you guess

Phillips shook his head You have got me he declared And the
money he gave you was not the money you lost Youre sure of that

Course Im sure of it In the first place I lost a packet of
clean tens and twenties this stuff Ive got in my pocket now is
all sorts ones and twos and fives and everything And in the
second place

Pardon me just a minute Captain Hunniwell Where did he get the
four hundred to give you do you think He hasnt cashed any large
checks at the bank within the last day or two and he would
scarcely have so much on hand in his shop

Not as much as thatno Although Ive known the absentminded
careless critter to have over two hundred knockin around among his
tools and chips and glue pots Probably he had some to start with
and he got the rest by gettin folks around town and over to
Harniss to cash his checks Anthony Hammond over there asked me a
little while ago when I met him down to the wharf if I thought
Shavins Winslow was good for a hundred and twentyfive Said Jed
had sent over by the telephone mans auto and asked him to cash a
check for that much Hammond said he thought twas queer he hadnt
cashed it at our bank thats why he asked me about it

Humph But why should he give his own money away in that fashion
And confess to stealing and all that stuff I never heard of such
a thing

Neither did anybody else Ive known Jed all my life and I never
can tell what loony thing hes liable to do next But this beats
all of em I will give in

You dont supposeyou dont suppose he is doing it to help you
because you are his friend Because he is afraid the bankor you
may get into trouble because ofwell because of having been so
careless

Captain Sam laughed once more No no he said Gracious king
I hope my reputations good enough to stand the losin of four
hundred dollars And Jed knows perfectly well I could put it back
myself if twas necessary without runnin me into the poorhouse
No taint for me hes doin it I aint the reason

And youre quite sure his story is ALL untrue You dont imagine
that he did find the money your money and then for some reason
or other change it with smaller bills and

Sshh sshh Charlie dont waste your breath I told you I KNEW
he hadnt found the four hundred dollars I lost didnt I Well I
do know it and for the very best of reasons in fact my stoppin
into his shop just now was to tell him what Id heard You see
Charlie old Sylvester Sage has got back from Boston and opened up
his house again And he telephoned me at two oclock to say that
the four hundred dollar packet was layin on his sittinroom table
just where I left it when he and I parted company four days or so
ago Thats how I KNOW Jed didnt find it

From the shadowy corner where Ruth Armstrong sat came a little gasp
and an exclamation Charles whistled

Well by George he exclaimed That certainly puts a crimp in
Jeds confession

Sartin sure it does When Sylvester and I parted we was both
pretty hot under the collar havin called each others politics
about every mean name we could think of I grabbed up my gloves
and what I thought was my money from the table and slammed out of
the house Seems all I grabbed was the two five hundred packages
the four hundred one was shoved under some papers and magazines and
there it stayed till Sylvester got back from his Boston cruise

But that dont answer my riddle he added impatiently What
made Jed act the way he did Got the answer Charlie

The young man shook his head No by George I havent he
replied

How about you Mrs Armstrong Can you help us out

Ruths answer was brief No Im afraid not she said There
was a queer note in her voice which caused her brother to glance at
her but Captain Hunniwell did not notice He turned to go

Well he said I wish youd think it over and see if you can spy
land anywheres ahead I need a pilot This course is too crooked
for me Im goin home to ask Maud maybe she can see a light So
long

He went out When Charles returned having accompanied his
employer as far as the door he found Ruth standing by her chair
and looking at him A glance at her face caused him to stop short
and look at her

Why Ruth he asked what is it

She was pale and trembling There were tears in her eyes

Oh Charlie she cried cant you see Hehe did it for you

Did it for me Did what Who What are you talking about Sis

Jed Jed Winslow Dont you see Charlie He pretended to have
found the money and to have stolen it just to save you He thought
youhe thought you had taken it

WHAT Thought I had taken it I had Why in the devil should he
think

He stopped When he next spoke it was in a different tone

Sis he asked slowly do you mean that he thought I took this
money because he knew I hadhad done that thing at Middleford
Does he knowabout that

The tears were streaming down her cheeks Yes Charlie she
said he knows He found it out partly by accident before you
came here Andand think how loyal how wonderful he has been
It was through him that you got your opportunity there at the bank
And nownow he has done this to save you Oh Charlie


CHAPTER XIX


The clock in the steeple of the Methodist church boomed eleven
times and still the lights shone from the sittingroom windows of
the little Winslow house and from those of Jeds living quarters
behind his windmill shop At that time of year and at that time of
night there were few windows alight in Orham and Mr Gabe Bearse
had he been astir at such an hour might have wondered why the
Armstrongs and Shavings were settin up Fortunately for every
one except him Gabe was in bed and asleep otherwise he might have
peeped under Jeds kitchen window shadehe had been accused of
doing such thingsand had he done so he would have seen Jed and
Charlie Phillips in deep and earnest conversation Neither would
have wished to be seen just then their interview was far too
intimate and serious for that

They had been talking since eight Charles and his sister had had
a long conversation following Captain Hunniwells visit and then
after a pretense at suppera pretense made largely on Babbies
accountthe young man had come straight to the shop and to Jed
He had found the latter in a state of extreme dejection He was
sitting before the little writing table in his livingroom his
elbows on the desk and his head in his hands The drawer of the
table was open and Jed was apparently gazing intently at
something within When Phillips entered the room he started
hastily slammed the drawer shut and raised a pale and distressed
face to his visitor

Eh he exclaimed Oh its you Charlie aint it IIer
good mornin Itsits a nice day

Charles smiled slightly and shook his head

Youre a little mixed on the time arent you Jed he observed
It WAS a nice day but it is a nice evening now

Eh Is it Land sakes I presume likely tis Must be after
supper time I shouldnt wonder

Supper time Why its after eight oclock Didnt you know it

Noo No I guess not II kind of lost run of the time seems
so

Havent you had any supper

Noo I didnt seem to care about supper somehow

But havent you eaten anything

No I did make myself a cup of tea but twant what youd call a
success    I forgot to put the tea in it    But it dont
make any difference I aint hungryor thirsty either

Phillips leaned forward and laid a hand on the older mans shoulder

Jed he said gently I know why youre not hungry Oh Jed
what in the world made you do it

Jed started back so violently that his chair almost upset He
raised a hand with the gesture of one warding off a blow

Do he gasped Do what

Why what you did about that money that Captain Hunniwell lost
What made you do it Jed

Jeds eyes closed momentarily Then he opened them and without
looking at his visitor rose slowly to his feet

So Sam told you he said with a sigh II didnt hardly think
hed do that    Course twas all right for him to tell he
added hastily I didnt ask him not to butbut he and I havin
beenerchums as you might say for so long II sort of
thought    Well it dont make any difference I guess Did
he tell youryour sister Did he tell her how Ihow I stole the
money

Charles shook his head

No he said quietly No he didnt tell either of us that He
told us that you had tried to make him believe you took the money
but that he knew you were not telling the truth He knew you
didnt take it

Eh Now    now Charlie that aint so Jed was even more
disturbed and distressed than before II told Sam I took it
andand kept it I TOLD him I did What more does he want
Whats he goin around tellin folks I didnt for What

Hush Jed He knows you didnt take it He knew it all the time
you were telling him you did In fact he came into your shop this
afternoon to tell you that the Sage man over at Wapatomac had found
the four hundred dollars on the table in his sittingroom just
where the captain left it Sage had just phoned him that very
thing He would have told you that but you didnt give him the
chance Jed I

But Jed interrupted His expression as he listened had been
changing like the sky on a windy day in April

Here here he cried wildly Whatwhat kind of talks that
Dodo you mean to tell me that Sam Hunniwell never lost that money
at all That all he did was leave it over at Wapatomac

Yes thats just what I mean

Thenthen all the time when I waswas givin him thethe other
money and tellin him how I found it andand allhe knew

Certainly he knew Ive just told you that he knew

Jed sat heavily down in the chair once more He passed his hand
slowly across his chin

He knew he repeated He knew    Then with a sudden gasp
as the full significance of the thought came to him he cried
Why ifif the money wasnt ever lost you couldntyou

Charles shook his head No Jed he said I couldnt have taken
it And I didnt take it

Jed gasped again He stretched out a hand imploringly Oh
Lord he exclaimed I never meant to say that II

Its all right Jed I dont blame you for thinking I might have
taken it Knowing what you did aboutwell about my past record
it is not very astonishing that you should think almost anything

Jeds agonized contrition was acute

Dont talk so Charlie he pleaded Dont IId ought to be
ashamed of myself I ammercy knows I am But    Eh Why
how did you know I knew aboutthat

Ruth told me just now After Captain Hunniwell had gone she told
me the whole thing About how Babbie let the cat out of the bag
and how she told you for fear you might suspect something even
worse than the truth although he added that was quite bad
enough Yes she told me everything Youve been a brick all
through Jed And now

Wait Charlie wait II dont know what to say to you I dont
know what you must think of me for everever once suspectin you
If you hadnt said to me only such a little spell ago that you
needed money so bad and would do most anything to get five hundred
dollarsif you hadnt said that I dont think the notion would
ever have crossed my mind

Phillips whistled Well by George he exclaimed I had
forgotten that No wonder you thought I had gone crooked again
Humph    Well Ill tell you why I wanted that money You
see Ive been trying to pay back to the man in Middleford the
money of his whichwhich I took before It is two thousand
dollars and with a shrug that looks a good deal bigger sum to
me now than it used to you can bet on that I had a few hundred
in a New York savings bank before Iwell before they shut me up
No one knew about it not even Sis I didnt tell her because
well I wish I could say it was because I was intending to use it
to pay back what I had taken but that wasnt the real reason why I
kept still about it To tell you the truth Jed I didnt feel
no I dont feel yet any too forgiving or kindly toward that chap
who had me put in prison Im not shirking blame I was a fool and
a scamp and all that but he ishes a hard man Jed

Jed nodded Seems to me Ruyour sister said he was a considerble
of a professer he observed

Professor Why no he was a bond broker

I mean that he professed religion a good deal Called himself a
Christian and such kind of names

Phillips smiled bitterly If he is a Christian I prefer to be a
heathen he observed

Umhm Well maybe he aint one You could teach a parrot to
holler Praise the Lord I callate and the more crackers he got
by it the louder hed holler So you never said anything about the
four hundred you had put by Charlie

No I felt that I had been treated badly andwhy Jed the man
used to urge me to dress better than I could afford to belong to
the most expensive club and all that sort of thing He knew I was
in with a set sporting ten times the money I could muster and
spending it too but he seemed to like to have me associate with
them Said it was good for the business

Sartin More crackers for Polly Go on

I intended that he should never have that money but after I came
here after I had been here for a time I changed my mind I saw
things in a different light I wrote him a letter told him I
meant to pay back every cent of the two thousand I had taken and
enclosed my check for the seven hundred and fifty I had put by
Since then I have paid him two hundred and fifty more goodness
knows how I have squeezed every penny from my salary that I could
spare I have paid him half of the two thousand and if everything
had gone on well some day or other I would have paid the other
half

Jed laid a hand on his companions knee Good boy Charlie he
said And how did theerprofessin poll parrot act about your
payin it back

Charles smiled faintly Just before I talked with you that day
Jed he said I received a letter from him stating that he did
not feel I was paying as rapidly as I could and that if he did not
receive another five hundred shortly he should feel it his duty to
communicate with my present employers Do you wonder I said I
would do almost anything to get the money

Jeds hand patted the knee sympathetically

Sho sho sho he exclaimed Have you heard from him since

No I wrote him that I was paying as fast as I could and that if
he communicated with my employers that would end any chances of his
ever getting more He hasnt written since afraid of stopping the
golden egg supply I presume    But there he added thats
enough of that Jed how could you do itjust for me Of course
I had come to realize that your heart was as big as a bushel
basket and that you and I were friends But when a fellow gives
up four hundred dollars of his own money and not only does that
but deliberately confesses himself a thiefwhen he does that to
save some one else who as he knew had really been a thief and who
he was pretty sure must have stolen againwhy Jed it is
unbelievable Why did you do it What can I say to you

Jed held up a protesting hand

Dont say anything he stammered Dont Itsits all
foolishness anyhow

Foolishness Itsoh I dont know what it is And to sacrifice
your reputation and your character and your friendship with Captain
Hunniwell all for me I cant understand it

Nownownow Charlie dont try to If I cant understand
myself moren half the time whats the use of your strainin your
brains II just took a notion thats all I

But Jed why did you do itfor me I have heard of men doing
such things forfor women sacrificing themselves to save a woman
they were in love with You read of that in books andyes I
think I can understand that But for you to do itfor ME

Jed waved both hands this time Sshh sshh he cried in frantic
protest His face was a brilliant crimson and his embarrassment
and confusion were so acute as to be laughable although Phillips
was far from laughing Sshh sshh Charlie pleaded Jed You
you dont know what youre talkin about Youre makin an awful
fuss about nothin Sshh Yes you are too I didnt have any
notion of tellin Sam I stole that four hundred when I first gave
it to him I was goin to tell him I found it thats all That
would keep him bottled up I figgered and satisfied and thenthen
you and Id have a talk and Id tell you what Id done andwell
some day maybe you could pay me back the money dont you see I
do hope he added anxiously you wont hold it against me for
thinkin maybe you had taken it Course Id ought to have known
better I would have known better if Id been anybody but Shavins
Winslow HE aint responsible

Hush Jed hush But why did you say you hadkept it

Eh Oh that was Sams doins He commenced to ask questions
and the first thing I knew he had me on the spider fryin over a
hot fire The more I sizzled and sputtered and tried to get out of
that spider the more he poked up the fire I declare I never
knew lyin was such a job When I see how easy and natural it
comes to some folks I feel kind of ashamed to think what a poor
show I made at it Well Sam kept pokin the fire and heatin me
up till I got desperate and swore I stole the money instead of
findin it And that was hoppin out of the fryin pan INTO the
fire he drawled reflectively

Charles smiled Captain Sam said you told him you took the money
to buy a suit of clothes with he suggested

Eh Did I Sho That was a real bright idea of mine wasnt it
A suit of clothes Humph Wonder I didnt say I bought shoe laces
or collar buttons or somethin    Sho    Dear dear
Well they say George Washinton couldnt tell a lie and Ive
proved I cant either only Ive tried to tell one and I dont
recollect that he ever did that    Humph    A suit of
clothes    Four hundred dollars    Solomon in all his
glory would have looked like a calico shirt and a pair of overalls
alongside of me eh    Humph

Phillips shook his head Nevertheless Jed he declared I
cant understand why you did it and I nevernever shall forget it
Neither will Ruth She will tell you so tomorrow

Jed was frightened No no no she mustnt he cried quickly
II dont want her to talk about it II dont want anybody to
talk about it Please tell her not to Charlie Please Its
its all such foolishness anyhow Lets forget it

It isnt the sort of thing one forgets easily But we wont talk
of it any more just now if that pleases you better I have some
other things to talk about and I must talk about them with some
one I MUSTIve got to

Jed looked at him The words reminded him forcibly of Ruths on
that day when she had come to the windmill shop to tell him her
brothers story and to discuss the question of his coming to Orham
She too had said that she must talk with some oneshe MUST

Haveyou talked em over withwith your sister he asked

Yes But she and I dont agree completely in the matter You
see Ruth thinks the world of me she always did a great deal more
than I deserve ever have deserved or ever will And in this
matter she thinks first of all of mewhat will become of me
providedwell provided things dont go as I should like to have
them That isnt the way I want to face the question I want to
know what is best for every one for her for me andand for some
one elsemost of all for some one else I guess he added

Jed nodded slowly For Maud he said

Charles looked at him How on earth he demanded What in
blazes are youa clairvoyant

Noo No But it dont need a spirit medium to see through a
window pane Charlie that is the average window pane he added
with a glance at his own which were in need of washing just then
You want to know he continued what youd ought to do now that
will be the right thing or the nighest to the right thing for
your sister and Babbie and yourselfand Maud

Yes I do It isnt any new question for me Ive been putting
it up to myself for a long time for months by George it seems
years

I know I know Well Charlie Ive been puttin it up to
myself too Have you got any answer

No none that exactly suits me Have you

I dont knows I haveexactly

Exactly Well have you any exact or otherwise

Um    Well Ive got one but    but perhaps it aint an
answer Perhaps it wouldnt do at all Perhaps    perhaps   

Never mind the perhapses What is it

Um    Suppose we let it wait a little spell and talk the
situation over just a little mite Youve been talkin with your
sister you say and she dont entirely agree with you

No I say things cant go on as theyve been going They cant

Umhm Meaninwhat things

Everything Jed do you remember that day when you and I had the
talk about poetry and all that When you quoted that poem about a
chaps fearing his fate too much Well Ive been fearing my fate
ever since I began to realize what a mess I was getting into here
in Orham When I first came I saw of course that I was skating
on thin ice and it was likely to break under me at any time I
knew perfectly well that some day the Middleford business was bound
to come out and that my accepting the bank offer without telling
Captain Hunniwell or any one was a mighty risky not to say mean
business But Ruth was so very anxious that I should accept and
kept begging me not to tell at least until they had had a chance
to learn that I was worth something that I gave in and    I
say Jed he put in breaking his own sentence in the middle
dont think Im trying to shove the blame over on to Sis Its
not that

Jed nodded Sho sho Charlie he said course taint I
understand

No Ill take the blame I was old enough to have a mind of my
own Well as I was saying I realized it all but I didnt care
so much If the smash did come I figured it might not come until
I had established myself at the bank until they might have found
me valuable enough to keep on in spite of it And I worked mighty
hard to make them like me Thenthenwell then Maud and I
became friends andandoh confound it you see what I mean You
must see

The Winslow knee was clasped between the Winslow hands and the
Winslow foot was swinging Jed nodded again

I see Charlie he said

Andand here I am The smash has come in a way already
Babbitt so Ruth tells me knows the whole story and was threatening
to tell but she says Grover assures her that he wont tell that he
the major has a club over the old fellow which will prevent his
telling Do you think thats true

I shouldnt be surprised Major Grover sartinly did seem to put
the fear of the Lord into Phin this afternoon    And thats
no onehorse miracle he drawled when you consider that all
the ministers in Orham havent been able to do it for forty odd
years    Um    Yes I kind of callate Phinll keep his
hatches shut He may bust his biler and blow up with spite but
he wont talk about you Charlie I honestly believe And we can
all thank the major for that

I shall thank him for one

Mercy on us No no He doesnt know your story at all He just
thinks Babbitt was circulatin lies about Ruthabout your sister
You mustnt mention the Middlefordermess to Major Grover

Humph Well unless Im greatly mistaken Ruth

Eh Ruthwhat

Oh nothing Never mind that now And allowing that Babbitt
will as you say keep his mouth shut admitting that the situation
is just what it was before Captain Hunniwell lost the money or
Babbitt came into the affair at all still Ive made up my mind
that things cant go on as they are Jed Iits a mighty hard
thing to say to another man butthe worldmy worldjust begins
and ends withwith her

His fists clenched and his jaw set as he said it Jed bowed his
head

With Maud you mean he said

Yes II dont care for anything else or anybody else   
Oh of course I dont mean just that you know I do care for Sis
and Babbie Buttheyre different

I understand Charlie

No you dont How can you Nobody can understand least of all
a set old crank like you Jed and a confirmed bachelor besides
Beg pardon for contradicting you but you dont understand you
cant

Jed gazed soberly at the floor

Maybe I can understand a little Charlie he drawled gently

Well all right Let it go at that The fact is that Im at a
crisis

Just a half minute now Have you said anything to Maud about
about how you feel

Of course I havent indignantly How could I without telling
her everything

Thats right thats right Course you couldnt and be fair and
honorable    Hum    Then you dont know whether or not
sheerfeels the same way aboutabout you

Charles hesitated Noo he hesitated No I dont know of
course But II feelI

You feel that that part of the situation aint what youd call
hopeless eh    Um    Well judgin from what Ive heard
I shouldnt call it that either Would it surprise you to know
Charlie that her dad and I had a little talk on this very subject
not so very long ago

Evidently it did surprise him Charles gasped and turned red

Captain Hunniwell he exclaimed Did Captain Hunniwell talk
with you aboutabout Maud andand me

Yes

Well by George Then he suspectedhe guessed that Thats
strange

Jed relinquished the grip of one hand upon his knee long enough to
stroke his chin

Um    yes he drawled drily Its worse than strange its
erparalyzin More clairvoyants in Orham than you thought there
was eh Charlie

But why should he talk with you on that subject about anything
soerpersonal and confidential as that With YOU you know

Jeds slow smile drifted into sight and vanished again He
permitted himself the luxury of a retort

Well he observed musingly as to that I cant say for certain
Maybe he did it for the same reason youre doin it now Charlie

The young man evidently had not thought of it in just that light
He looked surprised and still more puzzled

Why yes he admitted So I am of course And I do talk to
you about things I never would think of mentioning to other people
And Ruth says she does Thats queer too But we areer
neighbors of yours andand tenants you know Weve known you
ever since we came to Orham

Yees And Sams known me ever since I came Anyhow he talked
with me about you and Maud I dont think I shall be sayin moren
I ought to if I tell you that he likes you Charlie

Does he eagerly By George Im glad of that But oh well
with a sigh he doesnt know If he did know my record he might
not like me so well And as for my marrying his daughtergood
NIGHT with hopeless emphasis

No not good night by any means Maybe its only good mornin
Go on and tell me what you mean by bein at a crisis as you said a
minute ago

I mean just that The time has come when I must speak to Maud I
must find out iffind out how she feels about me And I cant
speak to her honorably without telling her everything And
suppose she should care enough for me totosuppose she should
care in spite of everything theres her father She is his only
daughter he worships the ground she steps on Suppose I tell him
Ive been bitterly a crook and a jailbird what will HE think
of meas a soninlaw And now suppose he was fool enough to
consentwhich isnt supposablehow could I stay here working for
him sponging a living from him with this thing hanging over us
all No I cantI cant Whatever else happens I cant do that
And I cant go on as I amor I wont Now what am I going to do

He had risen and was pacing the floor Jed asked a question

What does your sister want you to do he asked

Ruth Oh as I told you she thinks of no one but me How
dreadful it would be for me to tell of my Middleford record How
awful if I lost my position in the bank Suppose they discharged
me and the town learned why Ive tried to make her see that
compared to the question of Maud nothing else matters at all but
Im afraid she doesnt see it as I do She only seesme

Her brother Um    yes I know

Yes Well we talked and talked but we got nowhere So at last
I said I was coming out to thank you for what you did to save me
Jed I could hardly believe it then I can scarcely believe it
now It was too much for any man to do for another And she said
to talk the whole puzzle out with you She seems to have all the
confidence on earth in your judgment Jed She is as willing to
leave a decision to you apparently as you profess to be to leave
one to your wooden prophet up on the shelf there whatshisname
erIsaiah

Jed looked greatly pleased but he shook his head Im afraid her
confidence aint founded on a rock like the fellers house in the
Bible he drawled My decisions are liable to stick half way
betwixt and between same aserJeremiahs do But he added
gravely I have been thinkin pretty seriously about you and your
particular puzzle Charlie andand I aint sure that I dont see
one way out of the fog It may be a hard way and it may turn out
wrong and it may not be anything youll agree to But

What is it If its anything even half way satisfactory Ill
believe youre the wisest man on earth Jed Winslow

Well if I thought you was liable to believe that Id tell you to
send your believer to the blacksmiths cause there was somethin
wrong with it No I aint wise far from it But Charlie I
think youre dead right about what you say concernin Maud and her
father and you You CANT tell her without tellin him For your
own sake you mustnt tell him without tellin her And you
shouldnt as a straight up and down honorable man keep on workin
for Sam when you ask him under these circumstances to give you
his daughter You cant afford to have her say yes because she
pities you nor to have him give in to her because she begs him to
No you want to be independent to go to both of em and say
Heres my story and here am I You know now what I did and you
know too what Ive been and how Ive behaved since Ive been with
you You want to say to Maud Do you care enough for me to marry
me in spite of what Ive done and where Ive been And to Sam
Providin your daughter does care for me I mean to marry her some
day or other And you cant be on his pay roll when you say that
as I see it

Phillips stopped in his stride

Youve put it just as it is he declared emphatically Theres
the situationwhat then For I tell you now Jed Winslow I wont
give her up until she tells me to

Course not Charlie course not But theres one thing moreor
two things rather Theres your sister and Babbie Suppose you
do haul up stakes and quit workin for Sam at the bank can they
get along without your support Without the money you earn

The young man nodded thoughtfully Yes he replied I see no
reason why they cant They did before I came you know Ruth has
a little money of her own enough to keep her and Barbara in the
way they live here in Orham She couldnt support me as a loafer
of course and you can bet I should never let her try but she
could get on quite well without me    Besides I am not so
sure that   

Eh What was you goin to say Charlie

Oh nothing nothing I have had a feeling a slight suspicion
recently that But never mind that I have no right to even hint
at such a thing What are you trying to get at Jed

Get at

Yes Why did you ask that question about Ruth and Barbara You
dont mean that you see a way out for me do you

Weell I    er    I dont callate Id want to go so far
as to say that hardly Noo I dont knows its a way out
quite But as Ive told you Ive been thinkin about you and Maud
a pretty good deal lately and    er    hum   

For heavens sake hurry up Dont go to sleep now man of all
times Tell me what do you mean What can I do

Jeds foot dropped to the floor He sat erect and regarded his
companion intently over his spectacles His face was very grave

Theres one thing you can do Charlie he said

What is it Tell me quick

Just a minute Doin it wont mean necessarily that youre out of
your worries and troubles It wont mean that you mustnt make a
clean breast of everything to Maud and to Sam That you must do
and I know from what youve said to me that you feel you must
And it wont mean that your doin this thing will necessarily make
either Maud or Sam say yes to the question you want to ask em
That question theyll answer themselves of course But as I see
it if you do this thing youll be free and independent a man
doin a mans job and ready to speak to Sam Hunniwell or anybody
else LIKE a man And thats somethin

Something By George its everything What is this mans job
Tell me quick

And Jed told him


CHAPTER XX


Mr Gabe Bearse lost another opportunity the next morning The
late bird misses the early worm and as Gabriel was still slumbering
peacefully at six A M he missed seeing Ruth Armstrong and her
brother emerge from the door of the Winslow house at that hour
and walk to the gate together Charles was carrying a small
traveling bag Ruths face was white and her eyes were suspiciously
damp but she was evidently trying hard to appear calm and cheerful
As they stood talking by the gate Jed Winslow emerged from the
windmill shop and crossing the lawn joined them

The three talked for a moment and then Charles held out his hand

Well so long Jed he said If all goes well I shall be back
here tomorrow Wish me luck

Ill be wishin it for you Charlie all day and all night with
double time after hours and no allowance for meals replied Jed
earnestly You think Samll get your note all right

Yes I shall tuck it under the bank door as I go by If he should
ask what the business was which called me to Boston so suddenly
just dodge the question as well as you can wont you Jed

Sartin sure Hell think hes dealin with that colored man that
sticks his head through the sheet over to the Ostable fair the one
the boys heave baseballs at No he wont get anything out of me
Charlie And the other letter thatll get toto her

The young man nodded gravely I shall mail it at the postoffice
now he said Dont talk about it please Well Sis goodby
until tomorrow

Jed turned his head When he looked again Phillips was walking
rapidly away along the sidewalk Ruth leaning over the fence
watched him as long as he was in sight And Jed watched her
anxiously When she turned he ventured to speak

Dont worry he begged Dont Hes doin the right thing I
know he is

She wiped her eyes Oh perhaps he is she said sadly I hope
he is

I know he is I only wish I could do it too    I would he
drawled solemnly only for nineteen or twenty reasons the first
one of em bein that they wouldnt let me

She made no comment on this observation They walked together back
toward the house

Jed she said after a moment it has come at last hasnt it
the day we have foreseen and that I have dreaded so Poor Charlie
Think what this means to him

Jed nodded Hes puttin it to the touch to win or lose it all
he agreed same as was in the poem he and I talked about that
time Well I honestly believe he feels better now that hes made
up his mind to do it better than he has for many a long day

Yes I suppose he does And he is doing too what he has wanted
to do ever since he came here He told me so when he came in from
his long interview with you last night He and I talked until it
was almost day and we told each othermany things

She paused Jed looking up caught her eye To his surprise she
colored and seemed slightly confused

He had not said anything before she went on rather hurriedly
because he thought I would feel so terribly to have him do it So
I should and so I do of coursein one way but in another I am
glad Glad and very proud

Sartin Hell make us all proud of him or I miss my guess And
as for the rest of it the big question that counts most of all to
him I hopeyes I think thats comin out all right too Ruth
he added you remember what I told you about Sams talk with me
that afternoon when he came back from Wapatomac If Maud cares for
him as much as all that she aint goin to throw him over on
account of what happened in Middleford

Nono not if she really cares But does she careenough

I hope so I guess so But if she doesnt its better for him to
know it and know it now    Dear dear he added how I do
fire off opinions dont I A bodyd think I was loaded up with
wisdom same as one of those machine guns is with cartridges About
all Im loaded with is blanks I callate

She was not paying attention to this outburst but standing with
one hand upon the latch of the kitchen door she seemed to be
thinking deeply

I think you are right she said slowly Yes I think you are
right It IS better to know    Jed supposesuppose you
cared for some one would the fact that her brother had been in
prison make any difference inin your feeling

Jed actually staggered She was not looking at him nor did she
look at him now

Eh he cried Whywhy Ruth whatwhat

She smiled faintly And that was a foolish question too she
said Foolish to ask you of all men    Well I must go on
and get Babbies breakfast Poor child she is going to miss her
Uncle Charlie We shall all miss him    But there I promised
him I would be brave Good morning Jed

Butbut Ruth whatwhat

She had not heard him The door closed Jed stood staring at it
for some minutes Then he crossed the lawn to his own little
kitchen The performances he went through during the next hour
would have confirmed the opinion of Mr Bearse and his coterie that
Shavings Winslow was next door to loony He cooked a
breakfast but how he cooked it or of what it consisted he could
not have told The next day he found the stovelid lifter on a
plate in the ice chest Whatever became of the leftover pork chop
which should have been there he had no idea

Babbie came dancing in at noon on her way home from school She
found her Uncle Jed in a curious mood a mood which seemed to be a
compound of absentmindedness and silence broken by sudden fits of
song and hilarity He was sitting by the bench when she entered
and was holding an oily rag in one hand and a piece of emery paper
in the other He was looking neither at paper nor rag nor at
anything else in particular so far as she could see and he did not
notice her presence at all Suddenly he began to rub the paper and
the rag together and to sing at the top of his voice


 Hes my lily of the valley
 My bright and mornin star
 Hes the fairest of ten thousand to my soulHallelujah
 Hes my didumdudumdidum
 Di


Barbara burst out laughing Mr Winslows hallelujah chorus
stopped in the middle and he turned

Eh he exclaimed looking over his spectacles Oh its you
Sakes alive child how do you get around so quiet Havent
borrowed the cats feet to walk on have you

Babbie laughed again and replied that she guessed the cat wouldnt
lend her feet

She would want em herself probly Uncle Jed she added
Dont you think so

Jed appeared to consider

Well he drawled she might I presume likely be as selfish and
unreasonable as all that But then again she might    hum   
what was it the cat walked on in that story you and I was readin
together a spell ago ThaterSure Enough storyyou know By
Kipling twas

Oh I know It wasnt a Sure Enough story it was a Just So
story And the name of it was The Cat Who Walked by His Wild
Lone

Jed looked deeply disappointed Sho he sighed I thought
twas on his wild lone he walked I was thinkin that maybe hed
gone walkin on that for a spell and had lent you his feet   
Hum    Dear dear


 Oh trust and obey
 For theres no other way
 To be dedededidum
 But to trust and obey


Here he relapsed into another daydream After waiting for a
moment Babbie ventured to arouse him

Uncle Jed she asked what were you doing with those things in
your handwhen I came in you know That cloth and that piece of
paper You looked so funny rubbing them together that I couldnt
help laughing

Jed regarded her solemnly Its emery paper he said like fine
sandpaper you know And the cloths got ile in it Im cleanin
the rust off this screwdriver I hadnt used it for moren a
fortnit and it got pretty rusty this damp weather

The child looked at him wonderingly

But Uncle Jed she said there isnt any screwdriver Anyhow I
dont see any You were just rubbing the sandpaper and the cloth
together and singing Thats why it looked so funny

Jed inspected first one hand and then the other

Hum he drawled Huum    Well I declare    Now you
mention it there dont seem to be any screwdriver does there   
Here tis on the bench    And I was rubbin the sandpaper
with ile or ilin the sandpaper with the rag whichever you
like    Hum yees I should think it might have looked
funny    Babbie if you see me walkin around without any
head some mornin dont be scared Youll know that that part
of me aint got out of bed yet thats all

Barbara leaned her chin on both small fists and gazed at him
Uncle Jed she said youve been thinking about something
havent you

Eh    Why yes II guess likely maybe I have How did you
know

Oh cause I did Petunia and I know you ever and ever so well
now and were used toto the way you do Mamma says things like
forgetting the screwdriver are your execcentricks Is this what
youve been thinking about a nice eccentrick or the other kind

Jed slowly shook his head II dont know he groaned I
dasnt believe There there Thats enough of my tricks Hows
Petunias hair curlin this mornin

After the child left him he tried to prepare his dinner but it was
as unsatisfactory a meal as breakfast had been He couldnt eat
he couldnt work He could only think and thinking meant
alternate periods of delirious hope and black depression He sat
down before the little table in his livingroom and opening the
drawer saw Ruth Armstrongs pictured face looking up at him


Jed Oh Jed

It was Maud Hunniwells voice She had entered the shop and the
livingroom without his hearing her and now she was standing behind
him with her hand upon his shoulder He started turned and looked
up into her face And one glance caused him to forget himself and
even the pictured face in the drawer for the time and to think only
of her

Maud he exclaimed Maud

Her hair usually so carefully arranged was disordered her hat
was not adjusted at its usual exact angle and as for the silver
fox it hung limply backside front Her eyes were red and she held
a handkerchief in one hand and a letter in the other

Oh Jed she cried

Jed put out his hands There there Maud he said There
there little girl

They had been confidants since her babyhood these two She came
to him now and putting her head upon his shoulder burst into a
storm of weeping Jed stroked her hair

There there Maud he said gently Dont girlie dont Its
goin to be all right I know it    And so you came to me did
you Im awful glad you did I am so

He asked me to come she sobbed He wrote itinin the
letter

Jed led her over to a chair Sit down girlie he said and
tell me all about it You got the letter then

She nodded Yes she said chokingly itit just came Oh I
am so glad Father did not come home to dinner today He would
havehave seen me andandoh why did he do it Jed Why

Jed shook his head He had to do it Maud he answered He
wanted to do the right thing and the honorable thing And you
would rather have had him do that wouldnt you

Ohoh I dont know But why didnt he come to me and tell me
Why did he go away andand write me he had gone to enlist Why
didnt he come to me first Oh    Oh Jed how COULD he treat
me so

She was sobbing again Jed took her hand and patted it with his
own big one

Didnt he tell you in the letter why he asked

Yesyes but

Then let me tell you what he told me Maud He and I talked for
upards of three solid hours last night and I callate I understood
him pretty well when he finished Now let me tell you what he said
to me

He told her the substance of his long interview with Phillips He
told also of Charles coming to Orham of why and how he took the
position in the bank of his other talks with himWinslow

And so said Jed in conclusion you see Maud what a dreadful
load the poor young fellers been carryin ever since he came and
especially since hewell since he found out how much he was
carin for you Just stop for a minute and think what a load
twas His conscience was troublin him all the time for keepin
the bank job for sailin under false colors in your eyes and your
dads He was workin and pinchin to pay the two thousand to the
man in Middleford He had hangin over him every minute the
practical certainty that some daysome day surea person was
comin along who knew his story and then the fat would all be in
the fire And when it went into that fire he wouldnt be the only
one to be burnt there would be his sister and Babbieand you
most of all you

She nodded Yes yes I know she cried But whyoh why
didnt he come to me and tell me Why did he go without a word
He must have known I would forgive him no matter what he had done
It wouldnt have made any difference his having been inin
prison And nownow he may beoh Jed he may be killed

She was sobbing again Jed patted her hand We wont talk about
his bein killed he said stoutly I know he wont be I feel it
in my bones But Maud cant you see why he didnt come and tell
you before he went to enlist Suppose he had If you care for him
so muchas much as I judge you do

She interrupted Care for him she repeated Oh Jed

Yes yes dearie I know Well then carin for him like that
youd have told him just what you told me then that about his
havin done what he did and havin been where hes been not makin
any difference And youd have begged and coaxed him to stay right
along in the bank maybe Eh

Yes defiantly Of course I would Why not

And your father would you have told him

She hesitated I dont know she said but with less assurance
Perhaps so later on It had all been kept a secret so far all
the whole dreadful thing why not a little longer Besides
besides Father knows how much Charlie means to me Father and I
had a long talk about him one night and II think he knows And
he is very fond of Charlie himself he has said so so many times
He would have forgiven him too if I had asked him He always
does what I ask

Yes yees I callate thats so But to be real honest now
Maud would you have been satisfied to have it that way Would you
have felt that it was the honorable thing for Charlie to do Isnt
what he has done better Hes undertakin the biggest and finest
job a man can do in this world today as I see it Its the job
hed have taken on months ago if hed felt twas right to leave
RuthMrs Armstrongso soon afterafter bein separated from her
so long Hes taken on this big job this mans job and he says
to you Here I am You know me now Do you care for me still
If you do will you wait till I come back And to your dad to
Sam he says I aint workin for you now I aint on your
payroll and so I can speak out free and independent If your
daughterll have me I mean to marry her some day Aint that the
better way Maud Aint that how youd rather have him feeland
do

She sighed and shook her head II suppose so she admitted
Oh I suppose that you and he are right In his letter he says
just that Would you like to see it that part of it I mean

Jed took the crumpled and tearstained letter from her hand

I think I ought to tell you Maud he said that writin this
was his own idea It was me that suggested his enlistin although
I found hed been thinkin of it all along but I was for havin
him go and enlist and then come back and tell you and Sam But he
says No Ill tell her in a letter and then when I come back
shell have had time to think it over She wont say yes then
simply because she pities me or because she doesnt realize what it
means No Ill write her and then when I come back after enlistin
and go to her for my answer Ill know its given deliberate

She nodded He says that there she said chokingly But hehe
must have known Oh Jed how CAN I let him goto war

That portion of the letter which Jed was permitted to read was
straightforward and honest and manly There were no appeals for
pity or sympathy The writer stated his case and left the rest to
her that was all And Jed reading between the lines respected
Charles Phillips more than ever

He and Maud talked for a long time after that And at last they
reached a point which Jed had tried his best to avoid Maud
mentioned it first She had been speaking of his friendship for
her lover and for herself

I dont see what we should have done without your help Jed she
said And when I think what you have done for Charlie Why yes
and now I know why you pretended to have found the four hundred
dollars Father thought he had lost Pa left it at Wapatomac after
all you knew that

Jed stirred uneasily He was standing by the window looking out
into the yard

Yes yes he said hastily I know Dont talk about it Maud
It makes me feel more like a fool than usual and    er   
dont seem as if that was hardly necessary does it

But I shall talk about it When Father came home that night he
couldnt talk of anything else He called it the prize puzzle of
the century You had given him four hundred dollars of your own
money and pretended it was his and that you hadhad stolen it
Jed He burst out laughing when he told me that and so did I The
idea of your stealing anything You

Jed smiled feebly

Twas silly enough I give in he admitted You see he added
in an apologetic drawl ninetenths of this town think Im a prize
idiot and sometimes I feel its my duty to live upor downto my
reputation This was one of the times thats all Im awful glad
Sam got his own money back though

The money didnt amount to anything But what you did was the
wonderful thing For now I understand why you did it You
thoughtyou thought Charlie had taken it toto pay that horrid
man in Middleford That is what you thought and you

Jed broke in Dont Dont put me in mind of it Maud he
begged Im so ashamed I dont know what to do You seeyou
see Charlie had said how much he needed about that much money and
and so bein aa woodenhead I naturally

Oh dont Please dont It was wonderful of you Jed You not
only gave up your own money but you were willing to sacrifice your
good name to have Father your best friend think you a thief
And you did it all to save Charlie from exposure How could you
Jed

Jed didnt answer He did not appear to have heard her He was
gazing steadily out into the yard

How could you Jed repeated Maud It was wonderful I cant
understand I

She stopped at the beginning of the sentence She was standing
beside the little writingtable and the drawer was open She
looked down and there in that drawer she saw the framed
photograph of Ruth Armstrong She remembered that Jed had been
sitting at that desk and gazing down into that drawer when she
entered the room She looked at him now He was standing by the
window peering out into the yard Ruth had come from the back door
of the little Winslow house and was standing on the step looking up
the road evidently waiting for Barbara to come from school And
Jed was watching her Maud saw the look upon his faceand she
understood

A few moments later she and Ruth met Maud had tried to avoid that
meeting by leaving Jeds premises by the front door the door of
the outer shop But Ruth had walked to the gate to see if Babbie
was coming and as Maud emerged from the shop the two women came
face to face For an instant they did not speak Maud excited
and overwrought by her experience with the letter and her interview
with Jed was still struggling for selfcontrol and Ruth knowing
that the other must by this time have received that letter and
learned her brothers secret was inclined to be coldly defiant
She was the first to break the silence She said Good afternoon
and passed on But Maud after another instant of hesitation
turned back

Oh Mrs Armstrong she faltered may I speak with you just
just for a few minutes

And now Ruth hesitated What was it the girl wished to speak
about If it was to reproach her or her brother or to demand
further explanations or apologies the interview had far better not
take place She was in no mood to listen to reproaches Charles
was in her eyes a martyr and a hero and now largely because of
this girl he was going away to certain danger perhaps to death
She had tried for his sake not to blame Maud Hunniwell because
Charles had fallen in love with her but she was not just then
inclined toward extreme forbearance So she hesitated and Maud
spoke again

May I speak with you for just a few minutes she pleaded I
have just got his letter andoh may I

Ruth silently led the way to the door of the little house

Come in she said

Together they entered the sittingroom Ruth asked her caller to
be seated but Maud paid no attention

I have just got his letter she faltered II wanted you to
knowto know that it doesnt make any difference II dont
care If he loves me andand he says he doesI dont care for
anything else    Oh PLEASE be nice to me she begged
holding out her hands You are his sister andand I love him so
And he is going away from both of us

So Ruths coldness melted like a fall of snow in early April and
the April showers followed it She and Maud wept in each others
arms and were femininely happy accordingly And for at least a
half hour thereafter they discussed the surpassing excellencies of
Charlie Phillips the certainty that Captain Hunniwell would
forgive him because he could not help it and a variety of kindred
and satisfying subjects And at last Jed Winslow drifted into the
conversation

And so you have been talking it over with Jed observed Ruth
Isnt it odd how we all go to him when we are in trouble or need
advice or anything I always do and Charlie did and you say that
you do too

Maud nodded He and I have been what Pa calls chummies ever
since I can remember she said simply

I dont know why I feel that I can confide in him to such an
extent Somehow I always have And do you know his advice is
almost always good If I had taken it from the first we might all
of us have avoided a deal of trouble I have cause to think of
Jed Winslow as something sure and safe and trustworthy Like a
nice kindly old watch dog you know A queer one and a funny one
but awfully nice Babbie idolizes him

Maud nodded again She was regarding her companion with an odd
expression

And when I think continued Ruth of how he was willing to
sacrifice his character and his honor and even to risk losing your
fathers friendshiphow he proclaimed himself a thief to save
Charlie When I think of that I scarcely know whether to laugh or
cry I want to do both of course It was perfectly
characteristic and perfectly adorableand so absolutely absurd I
love him for it and as yet I havent dared thank him for fear I
shall cry again as I did when Captain Hunniwell told us Yet
when I think of his declaring he took the money to buy a suit of
clothes I feel like laughing Oh he IS a dear isnt he

Now ordinarily Maud would have found nothing in this speech to
arouse resentment There was the very slight and in this case
quite unintentional note of patronage in it that every one used
when referring to Jed Winslow She herself almost invariably used
that note when speaking of him or even to him But now her
emotions were so deeply stirred and the memories of her recent
interview with Jed of his understanding and his sympathy were so
vivid And too she had just had that glimpse into his most
secret soul So her tone as she replied to Ruths speech was
almost sharp

He didnt do it for Charlie she declared That is of course
he did but that wasnt the real reason

Why what do you mean

Dont you know what I mean Dont you really know

Why of course I dont What ARE you talking about Didnt do it
for Charlie Didnt say that he was a thief and give your father
his own money do you mean Do you mean he didnt do that for
Charlie

Yes He did it for you

For me For ME

Yes    Oh cant you understand Its absurd and foolish and
silly and everything but I know its true Jed Winslow is in love
with you Mrs Armstrong

Ruth leaned back in her chair and stared at her as if she thought
her insane

In love with ME she repeated Jed Winslow Maud dont

Its true I tell you I didnt know until just now although if
it had been any one but Jed I should have suspected for some time
But today when I went in there I saw him sitting before his desk
looking down into an open drawer there He has your photograph in
that drawer And later on when you came out into the yard I saw
him watching you I saw his face and that was enough    Oh
dont you SEE impatiently It explains everything You
couldnt understand nor could I why he should sacrifice himself
so for Charlie But because Charlie was your brotherthat is
another thing Think just think You and I would have guessed it
before if he had been any one else except just Jed Yes he is in
love with you    Its crazy and its ridiculous andand all
that of course it is But with a sudden burst of temper if
youif you dare to laugh Ill never speak to you again

But Ruth was not laughing


It was a cloudy day and Jeds livingroom was almost dark when Ruth
entered it Jed who had been sitting by the desk rose when she
came in

Land sakes Ruth he exclaimed its you aint it Let me
light a lamp I was settin here in the dark like a    like a
hen gone to roost    Eh Why its most supper time aint
it Didnt realize twas so late Ill have a light for you in a
jiffy

He was on his way to the kitchen but she stopped him

No she said quickly Dont get a light Id rather not
please And sit down again Jed just as you were There by the
desk thats it You see she added IIwell I have
something to tell you andand I can tell it better in the dark I
think

Jed looked at her in surprise He could not see her face plainly
but she seemed oddly confused and embarrassed

Sho he drawled Well Im sure I aint anxious about the
light myself You know Ive always had a feelin that the dark
was more becomin to my style of beauty Take me about twelve
oclock in a foggy night in a cellar with the lamp out and I
look pretty nigh handsometo a blind man    Umhm

She made no comment on this confession Jed after waiting an
instant for her to speak ventured a reminder

Dont mind my talkin foolishness he said apologetically Im
feelin a little more like myself than I have forfor a week or
so and when I feel that way Im bound to be foolish Just gettin
back to nature as the magazine folks tell about I callate tis

She leaned forward and laid a hand on his sleeve

Dont she begged Dont talk about yourself in that way Jed
When I think what a friend you have been to me and mine II cant
bear to hear you say such things I have never thanked you for
what you did to save my brother when you thought he had gone wrong
again I cant thank you nowI cant

Her voice broke Jed twisted in his seat

Nownow Ruth he pleaded do lets forget that Ive made a
fool of myself a good many times in my lifemore gettin back to
nature you seebut I hope I never made myself out quite such a
blitherin numbskull as I did that time Dont talk about it
dont I aint exactly what youd call proud of it

But I am And so is Charlie But I wont talk of it if you
prefer I shouldnt    Jed she hesitated faltered and then
began again Jed she said I told you when I came in that I had
something to tell you I have I have told no one else not even
Charlie because he went away before I wasquite sure But now I
am going to tell you because ever since I came here you have been
my father confessor so to speak You realize that dont you

Jed rubbed his chin

Weell he observed with great deliberation I dont knows
Id go as far as to say that Babbie and Ive agreed that Im her
backstepuncle but thats as nigh relation as Ive ever dast
figure I was to the family

Dont joke about it You know what I mean Well Jed this is
what I am going to tell you It is very personal and very
confidential and you must promise not to tell any one yet Will
you

Eh Why sartin of course

Yes I hope you may be glad to hear it It would make you glad
to know that I was happy wouldnt it

For the first time Jed did not answer in the instant The shadows
were deep in the little livingroom now but Ruth felt that he was
leaning forward and looking at her

Yes he said after a moment Yes    butI dont know as I
know exactly what you mean do I

You dontyet But I hope you will be glad when you do Jed
you like Major Grover dont you

Jed did not move perceptibly but she heard his chair creak He
was still leaning forward and she knew his gaze was fixed upon her
face

Yes he said very slowly I like him firstrate

Im glad Becausewell because I have come to like him so much
Jed hehe has asked me to be his wife

There was absolute stillness in the little room Then after what
seemed to her several long minutes he spoke

Yes    yes I see    he said And you Youve   

At first I could not answer him My brothers secret was in the
way and I could not tell him that But last nightor this
morningCharlie and I discussed all our affairs and he gave me
permission to tellLeonard So when he came today I told him
He said it made no difference Andand I am going to marry him
Jed

Jeds chair creaked again but that was the only sound Ruth
waited until she felt that she could wait no longer Then she
stretched out a hand toward him in the dark

Oh Jed she cried arent you going to say anything to me
anything at all

She heard him draw a long breath Then he spoke

Whywhy yes of course he said IIof course I am I
you kind of got me by surprise thats all    I hadnthadnt
expected it you see

I know Even Charlie was surprised But youre glad for my
sake arent you Jed

Eh    Yes oh yes ImIm glad

I hope you are If it were not for poor Charlies going away and
the anxiety about him and his problem I should be very happy
happier than I believed I ever could be again Youre glad of
that arent you Jed

Eh    Yes yes of course   

And you will congratulate me You like Major Grover Please say
you do

Jed rose slowly from his chair He passed a hand in dazed fashion
across his forehead

Yes he said again The majors a fine man    I do
congratulate you maam

Oh Jed Not that way As if you meant it

Eh    II do mean it    I hopeI hope youll be real
happy both of you maam

Oh not thatRuth

Yesyes sartin of course    Ruth I mean

She left him standing by the writing table After she had gone he
sank slowly down into the chair again Eight oclock struck and he
was still sitting there    And Fate chose that time to send
Captain Sam Hunniwell striding up the walk and storming furiously
at the back door

Jed roared the captain Jed Winslow Jed

Jed lifted his head from his hands He most decidedly did not wish
to see Captain Sam or any one else

Jed roared the captain again

Jed accepted the inevitable Here I am he groaned miserably

The captain did not wait for an invitation to enter Having
ascertained that the owner of the building was within he pulled
the door open and stamped into the kitchen

Where are you he demanded

Here replied Jed without moving

Here Wheres here    Oh youre in there are you Hidin
there in the dark eh Afraid to show me your face I shouldnt
wonder By the gracious king I should think you would be What
have you got to say to me eh

Apparently Jed had nothing to say Captain Sam did not wait

And youve called yourself my friend he sneered savagely
Friendyoure a healthy friend Jed Winslow What have you got
to say to me    eh

Jed sighed Maybe Id be better able to say it if I knew what you
was talkin about Sam he observed drearily

Know I guess likely you know all right And according to her
youve known all along What do you mean by lettin me take that
that states prison bird into my bank And lettin him associate
with my daughter andand    Oh by gracious king When I think
that you knew what he was all along II

His anger choked off the rest of the sentence Jed rubbed his eyes
and sat up in his chair For the first time since the captains
entrance he realized a little of what the latter said Before that
he had been conscious only of his own dull aching hopeless misery

Hum    So youve found out Sam have you he mused

Found out You bet Ive found out I only wish to the Lord Id
found out months ago thats all

Hum    Charlie didnt tell you    Noo no he couldnt
have got back so soon

Back be hanged I dont know whether hes back or not blast him
But I aint a fool ALL the time Jed Winslow not all the time I
aint And when I came home tonight and found Maud cryin to
herself and no reason for it so far as I could see I set out to
learn that reason And I did learn it She told me the whole
yarn the whole of it And I saw the scamps letter And I
dragged out of her that youyou had known all the time what he
was and had never told me a word    Oh how could you Jed
How could you

Jeds voice was a trifle less listless as he answered

It was told me in confidence Sam he said I COULDNT tell
you And as time went along and I began to see what a fine boy
Charlie really was I felt sure twould all come out right in the
end And it has as I see it

WHAT

Yes its come out all right Charlies gone to fight same as
every decent young feller wants to do He thinks the world of Maud
and she does of him but he was honorable enough not to ask her
while he worked for you Sam He wrote the letter after hed gone
so as to make it easier for her to say no if she felt like sayin
it And when he came back from enlistin he was goin straight to
you to make a clean breast of everything Hes a good boy Sam
Hes had hard luck and hes been in trouble but hes all right and
I know it And you know it too Sam Hunniwell Down inside you
you know it too Why youve told me a hundred times what a fine
chap Charlie Phillips was and how much you thought of him and

Captain Hunniwell interrupted Shut up he commanded Dont
talk to me that way Dont you dare to I did think a lot of him
but that was before I knew what hed done and where hed been Do
you callate Ill let my daughter marry a man thats been in
states prison

But Sam it want all his fault really And hell go straight
from this on I know he will

Shut up He can go to the devil from this on but he shant take
her with him    Why Jed you know what Maud is to me Shes
all Ive got Shes all Ive contrived for and worked for in this
world Think of all the plans Ive made for her

I know Sam I know but pretty often our plans dont work out
just as we make em Sometimes we have to change emor give em
up And you want Maud to be happy

Happy I want to be happy myself dont I Do you think Im
goin to give up all my plans and all my happiness justjust
because she wants to make a fool of herself Give em up Its
easy for you to say give up What do you know about it

It was the last straw Jed sprang to his feet so suddenly that his
chair fell to the floor

Know about it he burst forth with such fierce indignation that
the captain actually gasped in astonishment Know about it
repeated Jed What do I know about givin up my own plans and
and hopes do you mean Oh my Lord above Aint I been givin
em up and givin em up all my lifelong When I was a boy didnt
I give up the education that might have made me aa MAN instead
ofof a town laughin stock While Mother lived was I doin much
but give up myself for her I aint sayin twas any moren right
that I should but I did it didnt I And ever since its been
the same way I tell you Ive come to believe that life for me
means one give up after the other and wont mean anything but
that till I die And youyou ask me what I know about it YOU
do

Captain Sam was so taken aback that he was almost speechless In
all his long acquaintance with Jed Winslow he had never seen him
like this

Whywhy Jed he stammered But Jed was not listening He
strode across the room and seized his visitor by the arm

You go home Sam Hunniwell he ordered Go home and think
THINK I tell you All your life youve had just what I havent
You married the girl you wanted and you and she were happy
together Youve been looked up to and respected here in Orham
folks never laughed at you or called you town crank Youve got
a daughter and shes a good girl And the man she wants to marry
is a good man and if youll give him a chance and he lives
through the war hes goin into hell make you proud of him You
go home Sam Hunniwell Go home and thank God youre what you are
and AS you are    No I wont talk I dont want to talk   
Go HOME

He had been dragging his friend to the door Now he actually
pushed him across the threshold and slammed the door between them

Well for    the Lord    sakes exclaimed Captain Hunniwell

The scraping of the key in the lock was his only answer


CHAPTER XXI


A child spends time and thought and energy upon the building of a
house of blocks By the time it is nearing completion it has
become to him a very real edifice Therefore when it collapses
into an ungraceful heap upon the floor it is poor consolation to be
reminded that after all it was merely a block house and couldnt
be expected to stand

Jed in his own childlike fashion had reared his moonshine castle
beam by beam At first he had regarded it as moonshine and had
refused to consider the building of it anything but a dangerously
pleasant pastime And then little by little as his dreams
changed to hopes it had become more and more real until just
before the end it was the foundation upon which his future was to
rest And down it came and there was his future buried in the
ruins

And it had been all moonshine from the very first Jed sitting
there alone in his little livingroom could see now that it had
been nothing but that Ruth Armstrong young charming cultured
could she have thought of linking her life with that of Jedidah
Edgar Wilfred Winslow fortyfive town crank and builder of
windmills Of course notand again of course not Obviously she
never had thought of such a thing She had been grateful that was
all perhaps she had pitied him just a little and behind her
expressions of kindliness and friendship was pity and little else
Moonshinemoonshinemoonshine And oh what a fool he had been
What a poor silly fool

So the night passed and morning came and with it a certain degree
of bitterly philosophic acceptance of the situation He WAS a
fool so much was sure He was of no use in the world he never
had been People laughed at him and he deserved to be laughed at
He rose from the bed upon which he had thrown himself some time
during the early morning hours and after eating a cold mouthful or
two in lieu of breakfast sat down at his turning lathe He could
make childrens whirligigs that was the measure of his capacity

All the forenoon the lathe hummed Several times steps sounded on
the front walk and the latch of the shop door rattled but Jed did
not rise from his seat He had not unlocked that door he did not
mean to for the present He did not want to wait on customers he
did not want to see callers he did not want to talk or be talked
to He did not want to think either but that he could not help

And he could not shut out all the callers One who came a little
after noon refused to remain shut out She pounded the door and
shouted Uncle Jed for some few minutes then just as Jed had
begun to think she had given up and gone away he heard a thumping
upon the window pane and looking up saw her laughing and nodding
outside

I see you Uncle Jed she called Let me in please

So Jed was obliged to let her in and she entered with a skip and a
jump quite unconscious that her backstepuncle was in any way
different either in feelings or desire for her society than he
had been for months

Why did you have the door locked Uncle Jed she demanded Did
you forget to unlock it

Jed without looking at her muttered something to the effect that
he callated he must have

Umhm she observed with a nod of comprehension I thought
that was it You did it once before you know It was a execcen
trick leaving it locked was I guess Dont you think it was a
aone of those kind of tricks Uncle Jed

Silence except for the hum and rasp of the lathe

Dont you Uncle Jed repeated Barbara

Eh    Oh yes I presume likely so

Babbie sitting on the lumber pile kicked her small heels together
and regarded him with speculative interest

Uncle Jed she said after a few moments of silent consideration
what do you suppose Petunia told me just now

No answer

What do you suppose Petunia told me repeated Babbie Something
about you twas Uncle Jed

Still Jed did not reply His silence was not deliberate he had
been so absorbed in his own pessimistic musings that he had not
heard the question that was all Barbara tried again

She told me she guessed you had been thinking AWFLY hard about
something this time else you wouldnt have so many eccentricks
today

Silence yet Babbie swallowed hard

II dont think I like eccentricks Uncle Jed she faltered

Not a word Then Jed stooping to pick up a piece of wood from the
pile of cut stock beside the lathe was conscious of a little
sniff He looked up His small visitors lip was quivering and
two big tears were just ready to overflow her lower lashes

Eh    Mercy sakes alive he exclaimed Why whats the
matter

The lip quivered still more II dont like to have you not
speak to me sobbed Babbie Youyou never did it soso long
before

That appeal was sufficient Away for the time went Jeds
pessimism and his hopeless musings He forgot that he was a fool
the town crank and of no use in the world He forgot his own
heartbreak chagrin and disappointment A moment later Babbie was
on his knee hiding her emotion in the front of his jacket and he
was trying his best to soothe her with characteristic Winslow
nonsense

You mustnt mind me Babbie he declared Mymy head aint
workin just right today seems so I shouldnt wonder ifif I
wound it too tight or somethin like that

Babbies tearstained face emerged from the jacket front

Wound your HEAD too tight Uncle Jed she cried

Yees yes I was kind of extra absentminded yesterday and I
thought I wound the clock but I couldnt have done that cause the
clocks stopped Yet I know I wound somethin and its just as
liable to have been my head as anything else You listen just back
of my starboard ear there and see if Im tickin reglar

The balance of the conversation between the two was of a distinctly
personal nature

You see Uncle Jed said Barbara as she jumped from his knee
preparatory to running off to school I dont like you to do
eccentricks and not talk to me I dont like it at all and
neither does Petunia You wont do any morenot for so long at a
time will you Uncle Jed

Jed sighed Ill try not to he said soberly

She nodded Of course she observed we shant mind you doing a
few because you cant help that But you mustnt sit still and
not pay attention when we talk for ever and ever so long II
dont know precactly what I and Petunia would do if you wouldnt
talk to us Uncle Jed

Dont eh Humph I presume likely youd get along pretty well
I aint much account

Barbara looked at him in horrified surprise

Oh Uncle Jed she cried you mustnt talk so You MUSTNT
Whywhy youre the bestest man there is And there isnt anybody
in Orham can make windmills the way you can I asked Teacher if
there was and she said no So there And youre a GREAT
conslation to all our family she added solemnly We just
couldnt everEVER do without you

When the child went Jed did not take the trouble to lock the door
after her consequently his next callers entered without difficulty
and came directly to the inner shop Jed once more absorbed in
gloomy musingsnot quite as gloomy perhaps somehow the clouds
had not descended quite so heavily upon his soul since Babbies
visitlooked up to see there standing behind him Maud Hunniwell
and Charlie Phillips

He sprang to his feet Eh he cried delightedly Well well
so youre back Charlie safe and sound Well well

Phillips grasped the hand which Jed had extended and shook it
heartily

Yes Im back he said

Umhm    Anderhow did you leave Uncle Sam Old fellers
pretty busy these days cordin to the papers

Yes I imagine he is

Umhm    Well did youermake him happy Give his army
the one thing needful to make iterperfect

Charlie laughed If you mean did I add myself to it he said I
did I am an enlisted man now Jed As soon as Von Hindenburg
hears that hell commit suicide Im sure

Jed insisted on shaking hands with him again Youre a lucky
feller Charlie he declared I only wish I had your chance
Yes youre luckyin a good many ways with a glance at Maud
And speaking of Uncle Sam he added reminds me ofwell of
Daddy Sam Hows he behavin this mornin I judge from the fact
that you two are together hes a little more rational than he was
last night    Eh

Phillips looked puzzled but Maud evidently understood Daddy has
been very nice today she said demurely Charlie had a long
talk with him andand

And he was mighty fine declared Phillips with emphasis We had
a heart to heart talk and I held nothing back I tell you Jed it
did me good to speak the truth whole and nothing but I told
Captain Hunniwell that I didnt deserve his daughter He agreed
with me there of course

Nonsense interrupted Maud with a happy laugh

Not a bit of nonsense We agreed that no one was good enough for
you But I told him I wanted that daughter very much indeed and
provided she was agreeable and was willing to wait until the war
was over and I came back taking it for granted of course that I

He hesitated bit his lip and looked apprehensively at Miss
Hunniwell Jed obligingly helped him over the thin ice

Provided you come back a major general oror a commodore or a
corporals guard or somethin he observed

Yes gratefully thats it Im sure to be a high private at
least Well to cut it short Jed I told Captain Hunniwell all my
past and my hopes and plans for the future He was forgiving and
forbearing and kinder than I had any right to expect We
understand each other now and he is willing always provided that
Maud is willing too to give me my opportunity to make good That
is all any one could ask

Yes I should say twas    But Maud how about her You had
considerble of a job makin her see that you was worth waitin
for I presume likely eh

Maud laughed and blushed and bade him behave himself Jed demanded
to be told more particulars concerning the enlisting So Charles
told the story of his Boston trip while Maud looked and listened
adoringly and Jed watching the young peoples happiness was for
the time almost happy himself

When they rose to go Charlie laid a hand on Jeds shoulder

I cant tell you he said what a brick youve been through all
this If it hadnt been for you old man I dont know how it
might have ended We owe you about everything Maud and I Youve
been a wonder Jed

Jed waved a deprecating hand Dont talk so Charlie he said
gruffly

But I tell you I

Dont    You see with a twist of the lip it dont do to
tell aa screech owl hes a canary Hes liable to believe it by
and by and start singin in public    Then he finds out hes
just a fool owl and has been all along Humph Me a wonder   
A blunder you mean

Neither of the young people had ever heard him use that tone before
They both cried out in protest

Look here Jed began Phillips

Maud interrupted Just a moment Charlie she said Let me
tell him what Father said last night When he went out he left me
crying and so miserable that I wanted to die He had found
Charlies letter and wewe had had a dreadful scene and he had
spoken to me as I had never heard him speak before And later
after he came back I was almost afraid to have him come into the
room where I was But he was just as different as could be He
told me he had been thinking the matter over and had decided that
perhaps he had been unreasonable and silly and cross Then he
said some nice things about Charlie quite different from what he
said at first And when we had made it all up and I asked him what
had changed his mind so he told me it was you Jed He said he
came to you and you put a flea in his ear He wouldnt tell me
what he meant but he simply smiled and said you had put a flea in
his ear

Jed himself could not help smiling faintly

Weell he drawled I didnt use any sweet ile on the job
thats sartin If he said I pounded it in with a club twouldnt
have been much exaggeration

So we owe you that too continued Maud And afterwards when
Daddy and I were talking we agreed that you were probably the best
man in Orham There

And she stooped impulsively and kissed him

Jed very much embarrassed shook his head Thaterinsect I
put in your pas ear must have touched both your brains I
callate he drawled But he was pleased nevertheless If he
was a fool it was something to have people think him a good sort of
fool

It was almost four oclock when Jeds next visitor came He was
the one man whom he most dreaded to meet just then Yet he hid his
feelings and rose with hand outstretched

Why good afternoon Major he exclaimed Real glad to see you
Sit down

Grover sat Jed he said Ruth tells me that you know of my
good fortune Will you congratulate me

Jeds reply was calm and deliberate and he did his best to make it
sound wholehearted and sincere

I sartin do he declared Anybody that wouldnt congratulate
you on that could swap his head for a billiard ball and make money
on the dicker the ivory hed get would be better than the bone he
gave away    Yes Major Grover youre a lucky man

To save his life he could not entirely keep the shake from his
voice as he said it If Grover noticed it he put it down to the
sincerity of the speaker

Thank you he said I realize my luck I assure you And now
Jed first of all let me thank you Ruth has told me what a loyal
friend and counselor you have been to her and she and I both are
very very grateful

Jed stirred uneasily Sho sho he protested I havent done
anything Dont talk about it please IId rather you
wouldnt

Very well since you wish it I wont But she and I will always
think of it you may be sure of that I dropped in here now just
to tell you this and to thank you personally And I wanted to tell
you too that I think we need not fear Babbitts talking too much
Of course it would not make so much difference now if he did
Charlie will be away and doing what all decent people will respect
him for doing and you and I can see that Ruth does not suffer
But I think Babbitt will keep still I hope I have frightened him
I certainly did my best

Jed rubbed his chin

Im kind of sorry for Phin he observed

Are you For heavens sake why

Oh I dont know When youve been goin around ever since
January loaded up to the muzzle with spite and surething
vengeance same as an oldfashioned horse pistol used to be loaded
with powder and ball it must be kind of hard just as youre set
to pull trigger to have to quit and swaller the whole charge
Liable to give you dyspepsy if nothin worse I should say

Grover smiled The last time I saw Babbitt he appeared to be
nearer apoplexy than dyspepsia he said

Yees Well Im sorry for him I really am It must be pretty
dreadful to be so crossgrained that you cant like even your own
self without feelin lonesome    Yes thats a bad state of
affairs    I dont know but Id almost rather be town crank
than that

The Majors farewell remark made as he rose to go contained an
element of mystery

I shall have another matter to talk over with you soon Jed he
said But that will come later when my plans are more complete
Good afternoon and thank you once more Youve been pretty fine
through all this secretkeeping business if you dont mind my
saying so And a mighty true friend So true he added that I
shall in all probability ask you to assume another trust for me
before long I cant think of any one else to whom I could so
safely leave it Goodby

One more visitor came that afternoon To be exact he did not come
until evening He opened the outer door very softly and tiptoed
into the livingroom Jed was sitting by the little gas burner
stove one knee drawn up and his foot swinging There was a
saucepan perched on top of the stove A small hand lamp on the
table furnished the only light He did not hear the person who
entered and when a big hand was laid upon his shoulder he started
violently

Eh he exclaimed his foot falling with a thump to the floor
Who    Oh its you aint it Sam    Good land you
made me jump I must be gettin nervous I guess

Captain Sam looked at him in some surprise Gracious king I
believe you are he observed I didnt think you had any nerves
Jed No nor any temper either until last night You pretty
nigh blew me out of water then Ho ho

Jed was much distressed Sho sho Sam he stammered Im awful
sorry about that II wasnt feelin exactlyerfirst rate or I
wouldnt have talked to you that way IIyou know I didnt mean
it dont you Sam

The captain pulled forward a chair and sat down He chuckled
Well I must say it did sound as if you meant it Jed he
declared Yes sir I callate the average person would have been
willin to risk a small betsay a couple of millionthat you
meant it When you ordered me to go home I just tucked my tail
down and went Yes sir if you didnt mean it you had ME fooled
Ho ho

Jeds distress was keener than ever Mercy sakes alive he
cried Did I tell you to go home Sam Yes yes I remember I
did Sho sho    Well Im awful sorry I hope youll
forgive me Twant any way for a feller like me to talkto you

Captain Sams big hand fell upon his friends knee with a stinging
slap Youre wrong there Jed he declared with emphasis
Twas just the way for you to talk to me I needed it and with
another chuckle I got it too didnt I Ho ho

Sam I snum I

Sshh Youre goin to say youre sorry again I can see it in
your eye Well dont you do it You told me to go home and
think Jed and those were just the orders I needed I did go home
and I did think    Humph Thinkins a kind of upsettin job
sometimes aint it especially when you sit right down and think
about yourself what you are compared to what you think you are
Ever think about yourself that way Jed

It was a moment before Jed answered Then all he said was Yes

I mean have you done it lately Just given yourself right up to
doin it

Jed sighed Yees he drawled I shouldnt wonder if I had
Sam

Well probably twant as disturbin a job with you as twas for
me You didnt have as high a horse to climb down off of I
thought and thought and thought and the more I thought the meaner
the way Id acted and talked to Maud seemed to me I liked
Charlie Id gone around this county for months braggin about what
a smart able chap he was As I told you once Id rather have had
her marry him than anybody else I know And I had to give in that
the way hed behavedhis goin off and enlistin settlin that
before he asked her or spoke to me was a square manly thing to
do The only thing I had against him was that Middleford mess
And I believe hes a GOOD boy in spite of it

He is Sam That Middleford trouble want all his fault by any
means

I know He told me this mornin Well then if he and Maud love
each other thinks I what right have I to say they shant be
happy especially as theyre both willin to wait Why should I
say he cant at least have his chance to make good Nighs I could
make out the only reason was my pride and the big plans Id made
for my girl I came out of my thinkin spell with my mind made up
that what ailed me was selfishness and pride So I talked it over
with her last night and with Charlie today The boy shall have
his chance Both of em shall have their chance Jed Theyre
happy andwell I feel considerble better myself All else there
is to do is to just hope to the Lord it turns out right

Thats about all Sam And I feel pretty sure its goin to

Yes I know you do Course those big plans of mine that I used to
makeher marryin some rich chap governor or senator or
somethintheyre all gone overboard I used to wish and wish for
her like a youngone wishin on a load of hay or the first star
at night or somethin But if we cant have our wishes whywhy
then well do without em Eh

Jed rubbed his chin Sam he said Ive been doin a little
thinkin myself    Yees considerble thinkin    Fact
is seems now as if I hadnt done anything BUT think since the
world was cranked up and started turnin over And I guess theres
only one answer When we cant have our wishes then its up to us
toto

Well to what

Why to stick to our jobs and grin thats about all Taint
much I know especially jobs like some of us have but its
somethin

Captain Sam nodded Its a good deal Jed he declared Its
some stunt to grinin these days

Jed rose slowly to his feet He threw back his shoulders with the
gesture of one determined to rid himself of a burden

It isit is so Sam he drawled But maybe that makes it a
little more worth while What do you think

His friend regarded him thoughtfully Jed he said I never saw
anybody who had the faculty of seein straight through to the
common sense inside of things the way you have Maud and I were
talkin about that last night Go home and think and thank God
you said to me And that was what I needed to do Enlist and
youll be independent you said to Charlie and it set him on the
road Stick to your job and grin you say now How do you do
it Jed Remember one time I told you I couldnt decide whether
you was a dum fool or a King Solomon I know now Of the two of
us Im nigher to bein the dum fool and by the gracious king you
ARE a King Solomon

Jed slowly shook his head Sam he said sadly if you knew
what I know about me youd    but there youre talkin wild I
was callatin to have a cup of tea and youd better have one too
Im heatin some water on top of the stove now It must be about
ready

He lifted the saucepan from the top of the gas burner and tested
the water with his finger

Hum he mused its stone cold I cant see why it hasnt het
faster I laid a nice fresh fire too

He opened the stove door and looked in

Hum    he said again Yes yes    I laid it but Ier
hum    I forgot to light it thats all Well that proves Im
King Solomon for sartin Probably he did things like that every
day or so    Give me a match will you Sam


CHAPTER XXII


It had been a chill morning in early spring when Charlie Phillips
went to Boston to enlist Now it was a balmy evening in August and
Jed sat upon a bench by his kitchen door looking out to sea The
breeze was light barely sufficient to turn the sails of the little
mills again so thickly sprinkled about the front yard or to cause
the wooden sailors to swing their paddles The August moon was
rising gloriously behind the silver bar of the horizon From the
beach below the bluff came the light laughter of a group of summer
young folk strolling from the hotel to the postoffice by the
shore route

Babbie who had received permission to sit up and see the moon
rise was perched upon the other end of the bench Petunia in her
arms A distant drone which had been audible for some time was
gradually becoming a steady humming roar A few moments later and
a belated hydroaeroplane passed across the face of the moon a
dragonfly silhouette against the shining disk

That bumblebees gettin home late observed Jed The rest of
the hive up there at East Harniss have gone to roost two or three
hours ago Wonder what kept him out this scandalous hour Had
tire trouble think

Barbara laughed

Youre joking again Uncle Jed she said That kind of
aeroplane couldnt have any tire trouble cause it hasnt got any
tires

Mr Winslow appeared to reflect Thats so he admitted but I
dont know as wed ought to count too much on that I remember
when Gabe Bearse had brain fever

This was a little deep for Babbie whose laugh was somewhat
uncertain She changed the subject

Oh she cried with a wiggle theres a caterpillar right here
on this bench with us Uncle Jed Hes a fuzzy one too I can see
the fuzz the moon makes it shiny

Jed bent over to look That he said That little tiny one
Land sakes he aint big enough to be more than a kittenpillar
You aint afraid of him are you

Noo No I guess Im not But I shouldnt like to have him walk
on me Hed be soso ticklesome

Jed brushed the caterpillar off into the grass

There he goes he said Ive got to live up to my job as
guardian I expect Last letter I had from your pa he said he
counted on my lookin out for you and your mamma If he thought I
let ticklesome kittenpillars come walkin on you he wouldnt
callate I amounted to much

For this was the trust to which Major Grover had referred in his
conversation with Jed Later he explained his meaning He was
expecting soon to be called to active service over there Before
he went he and Ruth were to be married

My wife and Barbara will stay here in the old house Jed he
said if you are willing And I shall leave them in your charge
Its a big trust for theyre pretty precious articles but theyll
be safe with you

Jed looked at him aghast Good land of love he cried You
dont mean it

Of course I mean it Dont look so frightened man Its just
what youve been doing ever since they came here thats all Ruth
says she has been going to you for advice since the beginning I
just want her to keep on doing it

Butbut my soul II aint fit to be anybodys guardian   
II ought to have somebody guardin me Anybodyll tell you
that    Besides II dont think

Yes you do and you generally think right Oh come dont talk
any more about it Its a bargain of course And if theres
anything I can do for you on the other side Ill be only too happy
to oblige

Jed rubbed his chin Weell he drawled theres one triflin
thing Ive been hankerin to do myself but I cant Im afraid
Maybe you can do it for me

All right what is the trifling thing

Eh    Oh thaterCrown Prince thing Do him brown if
you get a chance will you

Of course the guardianship was in a sense a joke but in another
it was not Jed knew that Leonard Grovers leaving his wife and
Babbie in his charge was to a certain extent a serious trust
And he accepted it as such

Has your mamma had any letters from the major the last day or so
he inquired

Babbie shook her head No she said but shes expecting one
every day And Petunia and I expect one too and were just as
excited about it as we can be A letter like that is most par
particklesome exciting    No I dont mean particklesomeit
was the caterpillar made me think of that I mean particklear
exciting Dont you think it is Uncle Jed

Captain Sam Hunniwell came strolling around the corner of the shop
Jed greeted him warmly and urged him to sit down The captain
declined

Cant stop he declared Theres a letter for Maud from Charlie
in tonights mail and I want to take it home to her Letters like
that cant be held up on the way you know

Charlie Phillips too was in France with his regiment

I presume likely youve heard the news from Leander Babbitt Jed
asked Captain Sam

About his bein wounded Yes Gab flapped in at the shop this
afternoon to caw over it Said the telegram had just come to
Phineas I was hopin twasnt so but Eri Hedge said he heard it
too    Serious is it Sam

They dont say but I shouldnt wonder The boy was hit by a
shell splinter while doin his duty with exceptional bravery so
the telegram said Twas from Washinton of course And there
was somethin in it about his bein recommended for one of those
war crosses

Jed sat up straight on the bench You dont mean it he cried
Well well well Aint that splendid I knew hed do it too
Twas in him Sam he added solemnly did I tell you I got a
letter from him last week

From Leander

Yes    And before I got it he must have been wounded   
Yes sir before I got his letter    Twas a good letter Sam
a mighty good letter Some time Ill read it to you Not a
complaint in it just cheerfulness you know andand grit and
confidence but no brag

I see Well Charlie writes the same way

Yees They all do pretty much Well how about Phineas How
does the old feller take the news Have you heard

Why yes Ive heard Of course I havent talked with him Hed
no more speak to me than he would to the Evil One

Jeds lip twitched Why probably not quite so quick Sam he
drawled Phin ought to be on pretty good terms with the Old
Scratch Ive heard him recommend a good many folks to go to him

Ho ho Yes thats so Well Jim Bailey told me that when Phin
had read the telegram he never said a word Just got up and walked
into his back shop But Jerry Burgess said that later on at the
postoffice somebody said somethin about how Leander must be a
mighty good fighter to be recommended for that cross and Phineas
was openin his mail box and heard em Jerry says old Phin turned
and snapped out over his shoulder Why not Hes my son aint
he So there you are Maybe thats pride or cussedness or
both Anyhow its Phin Babbitt

As the captain was turning to go he asked his friend a question

Jed he asked what in the world have you taken your front gate
off the hinges for

Jed who had been gazing dreamily out to sea for the past few
minutes started and came to life

Eh he queried Diddid you speak Sam

Yes but you havent yet I asked you what you took your front
gate off the hinges for

Oh I didnt I took the hinges off the gate

Well it amounts to the same thing The gates standin up
alongside the fence What did you do it for

Jed sighed It squeaked like time he drawled and I had to
stop it

So you took the hinges off Gracious king Why didnt you ile
em so they wouldnt squeak

Eh    Oh I did set out to but I couldnt find the ile can
The only thing I could find was the screwdriver and at last I came
to the conclusion the Almighty must have meant me to use it so I
did Anyhow it stopped the squeakin

Captain Sam roared delightedly Thats fine he declared It
does me good to have you act that way You havent done anything
so crazy as that for the last six months I believe the old Jed
Winslows come back again Thats fine

Jed smiled his slow smile Im stickin to my job Sam he said

And grinnin Dont forget to grin Jed

Weell when I stick to MY job Sam most everybody grins

Babbie accompanied the captain to the place where the gate had
been Jed left alone hummed a hymn The door of the little
house next door opened and Ruth came out into the yard

Where is Babbie she asked

Shes just gone as far as the sidewalk with Capn Sam Hunniwell
was Jeds reply Shes all right Dont worry about her

Ruth laughed lightly I dont she said I know she is all
right when she is with you Jed

Babbie came dancing back Somewhere in a distant part of the
village a dog was howling dismally

What makes that dog bark that way Uncle Jed asked Babbie

Jed was watching Ruth who had walked to the edge of the bluff and
was looking off over the water her delicate face and slender
figure silveredged by the moonlight

Eh    That dog he repeated Oh hes barkin at the moon
I shouldnt wonder

At the moon Why does he bark at the moon

Oh he thinks he wants it I callate Wants it to eat or play
with or somethin Dogs get funny notions sometimes

Babbie laughed I think hes awfly silly she said He
couldnt have the moon you know could he The moon wasnt made
for a dog

Jed still gazing at Ruth drew a long breath

Thats right he admitted

The child listened to the lugubrious canine wails for a moment
then she said thoughtfully I feel kind of sorry for this poor
dog though He sounds as if he wanted the moon just dreadfly

Um    yes    I presume likely he thinks he does But hell
feel better about it by and by Hell realize that same as you
say the moon wasnt made for a dog Just as soon as he comes to
that conclusion hell be a whole lot better dog    Yes and a
happier one too he added slowly

Barbara did not speak at once and Jed began to whistle a doleful
melody Then the former declared with emphasis I think SOME
dogs are awfly nice

Um    What    Oh you do eh

She snuggled close to him on the bench

I think youre awfly nice too Uncle Jed she confided

Jed looked down at her over his spectacles

Sho    Bow wow he observed

Babbie burst out laughing Ruth turned and came toward them over
the dewsprinkled grass

What are you laughing at dear she asked

Oh Uncle Jed was so funny He was barking like a dog

Ruth smiled Perhaps he feels as if he were our watchdog
Babbie she said He guards us as if he were

Babbie hugged her backstepuncles coat sleeve

Hes a great big nice old watchdog she declared We love
him dont we Mamma

Jed turned his head to listen

Hum    he drawled That dog up town has stopped his howlin
Perhaps hes beginnin to realize what a lucky critter he is

As usual Babbie was ready with a question

Why is he lucky Uncle Jed she asked

Why Oh well he    he can LOOK at the moon and thats
enough to make any dog thankful
