Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Goethe she fell in love with Melchior de Canalis she wrote

of Ernest de la Briere thus there sprang up between the young girl
and the secretary a mutual love which resulted in marriage The

Doctor Desplein As one of the most envied women in Parisian circles
in the time of Louis Philippe she became the close friend of Mesdames

putting into use the talent neglected during her love affair became
a writer She wrote A Prince of Bohemia founded on an anecodote
related to her by Raoul Nathan and probably published this novel The
fear of endless scandal the entreaties of husband and mother and the
unworthiness of Lousteau finally led Dinah de la Baudraye to rejoin
her husband who owned an elegant mansion on rue de lArcade This
return which took place in May 1842 surprised Madame dEspard a
woman who was not easily astonished Paris of the reign of Louis

aware of her stewards affection ended by having very nearly the same

its former owner Before Buoret the grandfather of La Palferine

Gaubertin Fourchon Tonsard and Madame Soudry prepared no little
trouble for Montcornet the succeeding proprietor Sophie Laguerres

in the neighborhood of Amiens who were ignorant of their relationship
with her The Peasantry A Prince of Bohemia M H Gourdon de

LAMBERT Louis born in 1797 at Montoire in LoireetCher Only son
of simple tanners who did not try to counteract his inclination
shown when a mere child for study He was sent in 1807 to Lefebvre a
maternal uncle who was vicar of Mer a small city on the Loire near
Blois Under the kindly care of Madame de Stael he was a student in
the college of Vendome from 1811 to 1814 Lambert met there Barchon de
Penhoen and Jules Dufaure He was apparently a poor scholar but
finally developed into a prodigy he suffered the persecutions of
Father Haugoult by whose brutal hands his Treatise on the Will
composed during class hours was seized and destroyed The
mathematician had already doubled his capacity by becoming a
philosopher His comrades had named him Pythagoras His course
completed and his father being dead Louis Lambert lived for two
years at Blois with Lefebvre until growing desirous of seeing
Madame de Stael he journeyed to Paris on foot arriving July 14
1817 Not finding his illustrious benefactress alive he returned home
in 1820 During these three years Lambert lived the life of a workman
became a close friend of Meyraux and was cherished and admired as a
member of the Cenacle on rue des QuatreVents which was presided over
by Arthez Once more he went to Blois journeyed over Touraine and
became acquainted with Pauline Salomon de Villenoix whom he loved
with a passion that was reciprocated He had suffered from brain
trouble previous to their engagement and as the wedding day
approached the disease grew constantly worse although occasionally
there were periods of relief During one of these good periods in
1822 Lambert met the Cambremers at Croisic and on the suggestion of
Pauline de Villenoix he made a study of their history The malady
returned but was interrupted occasionally by outburts of beautiful
thought the fragments of which were collected by Mademoiselle
Salomon Louis had likewise occasional fits of insanity He believed
himself powerless and wished one day to perform on his own body

day before the date selected for his marriage with Pauline Louis

age played the saint and performed the duties of housekeeper for
M Picot professor of mathematics No 9 rue du ValdeGrace In the
service of this old philosopher she reaped enormous profits Madame
Lambert hypocritically took advantage of her apparent devotion to him
She sought Theodose de la Peyrade and begged him to write a memorial
to the Academy in her favor for she longed to receive the reward
offered by Montyon At the same time she put into La Peyrades keeping
twentyfive thousand francs which she had accumulated by her
household thefts On this occasion Madame Lambert seems to have been
the secret instrument of Corentin the famous policeagent The

her one morning for the express purpose of announcing the marriage of

later and asked pardon moreover of the foresaken woman Soon
afterwards the Duchesse de Langeais had the pleasure of captivating
the Marquis de Montriveau playing for him the role of Celimene and
making him suffer greatly He had his revenge however for scorned
in her turn or believing herself scorned she suddenly disappeared
from Paris after having scandalized the whole SaintGermain community
by remaining in her carriage for a long time in front of the
Montriveau mansion Some barefooted Spanish Carmelites received her
on their island in the Mediterranean where she became Sister Therese
After prolonged searching Montriveau found her and in the presence
of the mothersuperior had a conversation with her as she stood
behind the grating Finally he managed to carry her offdead In this
bold venture the marquis was aided by eleven of The Thirteen among
them being Ronquerolles and Marsay The duchess having lost her

NATHAN Raoul son of a Jew pawnbroker who died in bankruptcy a
short while after marrying a Catholic was for twentyfive years
182045 one of the best known writers in Paris Raoul Nathan touched
upon many branches the journal romance poetry and the stage In
1821 Dauriat published for him an imaginative work which Lucien de
Rubempre alternately praised and criticized The harsh criticism was
meant for the publisher only Nathan then put on the stage the Alcade
dans lEmbarrasa comedie called an imbroglio and presented at the
PanoramaDramatique He signed himself simply Raoul he had as
collaborator CursyM du Bruel The play was a distinct success
About the same time he supplanted Lousteau lover of Florine one of
his leading actresses About this time also Raoul was on terms of
intimacy with Emile Blondet who wrote him a letter dated from Aigues
Bourgogne in which he described the Montcornets and related their
local difficulties Raoul Nathan a member of all the giddy and
dissipated social circles was with Giroudeau Finot and Bixiou a
witness of Philip Bridaus wedding to Madame JJ Rouget He visited
Florentine Cabirolle when the Marests and Oscar Husson were there
and appeared often on the rue SaintGeorges at the home of Esther van
Gobseck who was already much visited by Blondet Bixiou and Lousteau
Raoul at this time was much occupied with the press and made a
great parade of Royalism The accession of Louis Philippe did not
diminish the extended circle of his relations The Marquise dEspard
received him It was at her house that he heard evil reports of Diane
de Cadignan greatly to the dissatisfaction of Daniel dArthez also
present Marie de Vandenesse just married noticed Nathan who was
handsome by reason of an artistic uncouth ugliness and elegant
irregularity of features and Raoul resolved to make the most of the
situation Although turned Republican he took very readily to the
idea of winning a lady of the aristocracy The conquest of Madame the
Comtesse de Vandenesse would have revenged him for the contempt shown
him by Lady Dudley but fallen into the hands of usurers fascinated
with Florine living in pitiable style in a passage between the rue
BasseduRempart and the rue NeuvedesMathurins and being often
detained on the rue Feydau in the offices of a paper he had founded
Raoul failed in his scheme in connection with the countess whom
Vandenesse even succeeded in restoring to his own affections by very
skilful play with Florine During the first years of Louis Philippes
reign Nathan presented a flaming and brilliant drama the two
collaborators in which were Monsieur and Madame Marie Gaston whose
names were indicated on the handbills by stars only In his younger
days he had had a play of his put on at the Odeon a romantic work
after the style of Pinto at a time when the classic was
dominant and the stage had been so greatly stirred up for three days
that the play was prohibited At another time he presented at the
TheatreFrancais a great drama that fell with all the honors of war
amid the roar of newspaper cannon In the winter of 183738 Vanda de
Mergi read a new romance of Nathans entitled La Perle de Dol The
memory of his social intrigues still haunted Nathan when he returned
so reluctantly to M de Clagny who demanded it of him a printed
note announcing the birth of Melchior de la Baudraye as follows
Madame la Baronne de la Baudraye is happily delivered of a child M
Etienne Lousteau has the honor of announcing it to you Nathan sought
the society of Madame de la Baudraye who got from him in the rue de
ChartresduRoule at the home of Beatrix de Rochefide a certain
story to be arranged as a novel related more or less after the style
of SainteBeuve concerning the Bohemians and their prince Rusticoli
de la Palferine Raoul cultivated likewise the society of the Marquise
de Rochefide and one evening of October 1840 a proscenium box at
the Varietes was the means of bringing together Canalis Nathan and
Beatrix Received everywhere perfectly at home in Marguerite
Turquets boudoir Raoul as a member of a group composed of Bixiou
La Palferine and Maitre Cardot heard Maitre Desroches tell how
Cerizet made use of Antonia Chocardelle to get even with Maxime de

NATHAN Madame Raoul wife of the preceding born Sophie
Grignault in 1805 in Bretagne She was a perfect beauty her foot
alone left something to be desired When very young she tried the
double career of pleasure and the stage under the now famous name of
Florine The details of her early life are rather obscure Madame
Nathan as supernumerary of the Gaite had six lovers before choosing
Etienne Lousteau in that relation in 1821 She was at that time
closely connected with Florentine Cabirolle Claudine Chaffaroux
Coralie and Marie Godeschal She had also a supporter in Matifat the
druggist and lodged on the rue de Bondy where after a brilliant
success at the PanoramaDramatique with Coralie and Bouffe she
received in maginficent style the diplomatists Lucien de Rubempre
Camusot and others Florine soon made an advantageous change in lover
home theatre and protector Nathan whom she afterwards married
supplanted Lousteau about the middle of Louis Philippes reign Her
home was on rue Hauteville intead of rue de Bondy and she had moved
from the stage of the Panorama to that of the Gymnase Having made an
engagement at the theatre of the Boulevard BonneNouvelle she met
there her old rival Coralie against whom she organized a cabal she
was distinguished for the brilliancy of her costumes and brought into
her train of followers successively the opulent Dudley Desire
Minoret M des Grassins the banker of Saumur and M du Rouvre she
even ruined the last two Florines fortune rose during the monarchy

Alsatian banker Of better judgment than his employer he did not
believe in the success of the Emperor in 1815 and speculated very
skilfully on the battle of Waterloo Nucingen now carried on business
alone and on his own account in Paris and elsewhere he thus
prepared by degrees the famous house of the rue SaintLazare and laid
the foundation of a fortune which under Louis Philippe reached
almost eighteen million francs At this period he married one of the
two daughters of a rich vermicellimaker Mademoiselle Delphine
Goriot by whom he had a daughter Augusta eventually the wife of
Eugene de Rastignac From the first years of the Restoration may be
dated the real brilliancy of his career the result of a combination
with the Kellers Ferdinand du Tillet and Eugene de Rastignac in the
successful manipulation of schemes in connection with the Wortschin
mines followed by opportune assignments and adroitly managed cases of
bankruptcy These various combinations ruined the Ragons the
Aiglemonts the Aldriggers and the Beaudenords At this time too
Nucingen though clamorously declaring himself an outandout
Bourbonist turned a deaf ear to Cesar Birotteaus appeals for credit
in spite of knowing of the latters consistent Royalism There was a
time in the barons life when he seemed to change his nature it was
when after giving up his hired dancer he madly entered upon an amour

afterwards almost beyond a question of doubt but the fact of the
case always remained unknown for M de Valois an unusually
successful gamester was interested in spreading a report of the
return of this loan to shadow the resources that he derived from the
gaming table and so five years later about 1821 Etienne Lousteau
declared that the Pombreton succession and the Maubreuil affair
were among the most profitable stereotypes of journalism Finally

the embroidery of uniforms that was bought in 1815 by M Rivet
first cousin of the first Madame Camusot of the Cocon dOr sole heir
of the famous Pons brothers embroiderers to the Court under the
Empire he won the Prix de Rome for musical composition returned to
Paris about 1810 and was for many years famous for his romances and
melodies which were full of delicacy and good taste From his stay in
Italy Pons brought back the tastes of the bibliomaniac and a love for
works of art His passion for collecting consumed almost his entire
patrimony Pons became Sauvageots rival Monistrol and Elie Magus
felt a hidden but envious appreciation of the artistic treasures
ingeniously and economically collected by the musician Being ignorant
of the rare value of his museum he went from house to house giving
private lessons in harmony This lack of knowledge proved his ruin
afterwards for he became all the more fond of paintings stones and
furniture as lyric glory was denied him and his ugliness coupled
with his supposed poverty kept him from getting married The
pleasures of a gourmand replaced those of the lover he likewise found
some consolation for his isolation in his friendship with Schmucke
Pons suffered from his taste for high living he grew old like a
parasitic plant outside the circle of his family only tolerated by
his distant cousins the Camusot de Marvilles and their connections
Cardot Berthier and Popinot In 1834 at the awarding of the prize to
the young ladies of a boardingschool he met the pianist Schmucke a
teacher as well as himself and in the strong intimacy that grew up
between them he found some compensation for the blighted hopes of his
existence Sylvain Pons was director of the orchestra at the theatre
of which Felix Gaudissart was manager during the monarchy of July He
had Schmucke admitted there with whom he passed several happy years
in a house on the rue de Normandie belonging to CJ Pillerault
The bitterness of Madeleine Vivet and Amelie Camusot de Marville and
the covetousness of Madame Cibot the doorkeeper and Fraisier
Magus Poulain and Remonencq were perhaps the indirect causes of the
case of hepatitis of which Pons died in April 1845 appointing
Schmucke his residuary legatee before Maitre Leopold Hannequin who
had been hastily summoned by Heloise Brisetout Pons was on the point
of being employed to compose a piece of ballet music entitled Les
Mohicans This work most likely fell to his successor Garangeot
Cousin Pons

 M Alphonse de Launay has derived from the life of Sylvain Pons a
 drama that was presented at the Cluny theatre Paris about 1873

years later he lost his wife who had brought him for dowry an
income of six thousand francs representing exactly twice his personal
assets Living from this time at the rue de Fouarre Popinot was able
to give free rein to the exercise of charity a virtue that had become
a passion with him At the urgent instance of Octave de Bauvan Jean
Jules Popinot in order to aid Honorine the Counts wife sent her a
pretended commissionmerchant probably Felix Gaudissart offering a
more than generous price for the flowers she made Honorine Jean
Jules Popinot eventually established a sort of benevolent agency
Lavienne his servant and Horace Bianchon his wifes nephew aided
him He relieved Madame Toupinet a poor woman on the rue du Petit
Banquier from want 1828 Madame dEspards request for a guardian
for her husband served to divert Popinot from his role of Saint
Vincent de Paul a man of rare delicacy hidden beneath a rough and
uncultured exterior he immediately discovered the injustice of the
wrongs alleged by the marchioness and recognized the real victim in
M dEspard when he crossquestioned him at No 22 rue de la
MontagneSainteGenevieve in an apartment the good management of
which he seemed to envy though the rooms were simply furnished and
in striking contrast with the splendor of which he had been a witness
at the home of the marchioness in the Faubourg SaintHonore A delay
caused by a cold in the head and especially the influence of Madame
dEspards intrigues removed Popinot from the cause in which Camusot
was substituted The Commission in Lunacy We have varying accounts

mourned the death of the judge in 1833 The Seamy Side of History

responsible for this progress and also gave him an introduction into
the home of M Leprince a wealthy widower who had formerly been an
auctioneer Rabourdin met loved and married this mans only daughter
Beginning with this time when his influential friend probably died
Rabourdin saw the end of his own rapid progress Despite his faithful
intelligent efforts he occupied at forty the same position In 1824
the death of M Flamet de la Billardiere left open the place of
division chief This office to which Rabourdin had long aspired was
given to the incapable Baudoyer who had been at the head of a bureau
through the influence of money and the Church Disgusted Rabourdin
sent in his resignation He had been responsible for a rather
remarkable plan for executive and social reform and this possibly
contributed to his overthrow During his career as a minister
Rabourdin lived on rue Duphot He had by his wife two children
Charles born in 1815 and a daughter born two years later About
1830 Rabourdin paid a visit to the Bureau of Finances where he saw

she did not consider him of high enough station This did not prevent
her loving him sincerely Although she was very extravagant she
remained always strictly faithful to him By listening to the demands
of Chardin des Lupeaulx secretarygeneral in the Department of

NOTE

The Repertory of the Comedie Humaine as the reader can see for
himself should include only those episodes introducing characters
interrelated and continually recurring Consequently the stories
entitled The Exiles About Catherine de Medici Maitre
Cornelius The Unknown Masterpiece The Elixir of Life Christ
in Flanders which antedate the eighteenth century and Seraphita
which deals with the supernatural are omitted together with the
Analytical Studies But The Hated Son furnishes some indispensable
information concerning a few biographies The Dramas are outside the
action of the Comedie so contribute no names

According to Theophile Gautier The Comedie Humaine embraces two
thousand characters His reckoning is nearly exact but as a result of
crossreferences surnames assumed names and the like that number is
far exceeded in this work which nevertheless omits many characters
outside the action as Chevet Decamps Delacroix Finot Sr the
child of Calyste and Sabine du Guenic Noemi Magus Meyerbeer
Herbaut Houbigant Tanrade Mousqueton Arnal Barrot Bonald
Berryer Gautier Gozlan Hugo Hyacinthe Lafont Lamartine
Lassailly F Lemaitre Charles X Louis Philippe Odry Talma
Thiers Villele Rossini Rousseau Mlle Dejazet Mlle Georges etc
