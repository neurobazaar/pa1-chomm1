CHAPTER I

THE SPELLINGMATCH


The Twentieth school was built of logs hewn on two sides The cracks
were chinked and filled with plaster which had a curious habit of
falling out during the summer months no one knew how but somehow the
holes always appeared on the boys side and being there were found to
be most useful for as looking out of the window was forbidden through
these holes the boys could catch glimpses of the outer worldglimpses
worth catching too for all around stood the great forest the
playground of boys and girls during noonhour and recesses an enchanted
land peopled not by fairies elves and other shadowy beings of
fancy but with living things squirrels and chipmunks and weasels
chattering groundhogs thumping rabbits and stealthy foxes not
to speak of a host of flying things from the little graybird that
twittered its happy nonsense all day to the bigeyed owl that hooted
solemnly when the moon came out A wonderful place this forest for
children to live in to know and to love and in after days to long
for

It was Friday afternoon and the long hot July day was drawing to a
weary close Mischief was in the air and the master Archibald Munro
or Archie Murro as the boys called him was holding himself in with
a very firm hand the lines about his mouth showing that he was fighting
back the pain which had never quite left him from the day he had twisted
his knee out of joint five years ago in a wrestling match and which
in his weary moments gnawed into his vitals He hated to lose his
grip of himself for then he knew he should have to grow stern and
terrifying and rule these young imps in the forms in front of him by
what he called afterwards in his moments of selfloathing sheer brute
force and that he always counted a defeat

Munro was a born commander His pale intellectual face with its square
chin and firm mouth its noble forehead and deepset gray eyes carried
a look of such strength and indomitable courage that no boy however
big ever thought of anything but obedience when the word of command
came He was the only master who had ever been able to control without
at least one appeal to the trustees the stormy tempers of the young
giants that used to come to school in the winter months

The school never forgot the day when big Bob Fraser answered back in
class For before the words were well out of his lips the master with
a single stride was in front of him and laying two swift stinging
cuts from the rawhide over big Bobs back commanded Hold out your
hand in a voice so terrible and with eyes of such blazing light that
before Bob was aware he shot out his hand and stood waiting the blow
The school never in all its history received such a thrill as the next
few moments brought for while Bob stood waiting the masters words
fell clearcut upon the dead silence No Robert you are too big to
thrash You are a man No man should strike youand I apologize And
then big Bob forgot his wonted sheepishness and spoke out with a mans
voice I am sorry I spoke back sir And then all the girls began
to cry and wipe their eyes with their aprons while the master and Bob
shook hands silently From that day and hour Bob Fraser would have slain
any one offering to make trouble for the master and Archibald Munros
rule was firmly established

He was just and impartial in all his decisions and absolute in his
control and besides he had the rare faculty of awakening in his pupils
an enthusiasm for work inside the school and for sports outside

But now he was holding himself in and with set teeth keeping back the
pain The week had been long and hot and trying and this day had been
the worst of all Through the little dirty panes of the uncurtained
windows the hot sun had poured itself in a flood of quivering light all
the long day Only an hour remained of the day but that hour was to
the master the hardest of all the week The big boys were droning lazily
over their books the little boys in the forms just below his desk
were bubbling over with spiritsspirits of whose origin there was no
reasonable ground for doubt

Suddenly Hughie Murray the ministers boy a very special imp held up
his hand

Well Hughie said the master for the tenth time within the hour
replying to the signal

Spellingmatch

The master hesitated It would be a vast relief but it was a little
like shirking On all sides however hands went up in support of
Hughies proposal and having hesitated he felt he must surrender or
become terrifying at once

Very well he said Margaret Aird and Thomas Finch will act as
captains At once there was a gleeful hubbub Slates and books were
slung into desks

Order or no spellingmatch The alternative was awful enough to quiet
even the impish Hughie who knew the tone carried no idle threat and
who loved a spellingmatch with all the ardor of his little fighting
soul

The captains took their places on each side of the school and with
careful deliberation began the selecting of their men scanning
anxiously the rows of faces looking at the maps or out of the windows
and bravely trying to seem unconcerned Chivalry demanded that Margaret
should have first choice Hughie Murray called out Margaret
for Hughie though only eight years old had preternatural gifts in
spelling his mothers training had done that for him At four he knew
every Bible story by heart and would tolerate no liberties with the
text at six he could read the third reader at eight he was the best
reader in the fifth and to do him justice he thought no better of
himself for that It was no trick to read If he could only run and
climb and swim and dive like the big boys then he would indeed feel
uplifted but mere spelling and reading Huh that was nothing

Ranald Macdonald called Thomas Finch and a big lanky boy of fifteen
or sixteen rose and marched to his place He was a boy one would look at
twice He was far from handsome His face was long and thin and dark
with a straight nose and large mouth and high cheekbones but he had
fine black eyes though they were fierce and had a look in them that
suggested the woods and the wild things that live there But Ranald
though his attendance was spasmodic and dependent upon the suitability
or otherwise of the weather for hunting was the best speller in the
school

For that reason Margaret would have chosen him and for another which
she would not for worlds have confessed even to herself And do you
think she would have called Ranald Macdonald to come and stand up beside
her before all these boys Not for the glory of winning the match and
carrying the medal for a week But how gladly would she have given up
glory and medal for the joy of it if she had dared

At length the choosing was over and the school ranged in two opposing
lines with Margaret and Thomas at the head of their respective forces
and little Jessie MacRae and Johnnie Aird with a single big curl on
the top of his head at the foot It was a point of honor that no blood
should be drawn at the first round To Thomas who had second choice
fell the right of giving the first word So to little Jessie at the
foot he gave Ox

Ox ox whispered Jessie shyly dodging behind her neighbor

In said Margaret to Johnnie Aird

Is in said Johnnie stoutly

Right said the master silencing the shout of laughter Next word

With like gentle courtesies the battle began but in the second
round the little A B Cs were ruthlessly swept off the field with
secondbook words and retired to their seats in supreme exultation
amid the applause of their fellows still left in the fight After
that there was no mercy It was a giveandtake battle the successful
speller having the right to give the word to the opposite side The
master was umpire and after his Next had fallen there was no appeal
But if a mistake were made it was the opponents part and privilege to
correct with all speed lest a second attempt should succeed

Steadily and amid growing excitement the lines grew less till there
were left on one side Thomas with Ranald supporting him and on the
other Margaret with Hughie beside her his face pale and his dark eyes
blazing with the light of battle

Without varying fortune the fight went on Margaret still serene and
with only a touch of color in her face gave out her words with even
voice and spelled her opponents with calm deliberation Opposite her
Thomas stood stolid slow and wary He had no nerves to speak of and
the only chance of catching him lay in lulling him off to sleep

They were now among the deadly words

Parallelopiped challenged Hughie to Ranald who met it easily giving
Margaret hyphen in return

Hyphen spelled Margaret and then with cunning carelessness
gave Thomas heifer Hypher she called it

Thomas took it lightly

Heipher

Like lightning Hughie was upon him Heifer

Fer shouted Thomas The two yells came almost together

There was a deep silence All eyes were turned upon the master

I think Hughie was first he said slowly A great sigh swept over the
school and then a wave of applause

The master held up his hand

But it was so very nearly a tie that if Hughie is willing

All right sir cried Hughie eager for more fight

But Thomas in sullen rage strode to his seat muttering I was just as
soon anyway Every one heard and waited looking at the master

The match is over said the master quietly Great disappointment
showed in every face

There is just one thing better than winning and that is taking defeat
like a man His voice was grave and with just a touch of sadness The
children sensitive to moods as is the characteristic of children felt
the touch and sat subdued and silent

There was no improving of the occasion but with the same sad gravity
the school was dismissed and the children learned that day one of
lifes golden lessonsthat the man who remains master of himself never
knows defeat

The master stood at the door watching the children go down the slope to
the road and then take their ways north and south till the forest hid
them from his sight

Well he muttered stretching up his arms and drawing a great breath
its over for another week A pretty near thing though



CHAPTER II

THE DEEPOLE


Archibald Munro had a steady purpose in lifeto play the man and to
allow no pain of hisand pain never left him longto spoil his work
or to bring a shadow to the life of any other And though he had his
hard times no one who could not read the lines about his mouth ever
knew how hard they were

It was this struggle for selfmastery that made him the man he was and
taught him the secrets of nobleness that he taught his pupils with their
three Rs and this was the best of his work for the Twentieth school

North and south in front of the school the road ran through the
deep forest of great pines with underbrush of balsam and spruce and
silverbirch but from this main road ran little blazed paths that led
to the farm clearings where lay the childrens homes Here and there
set in their massive frames of dark green forest lay the little farms
the tiny fenced fields surrounding the little log houses and barns
These were the homes of a people simple of heart and manners but
sturdy clean living and clear thinking with their brittle Highland
courage toughened to endurance by their long fight with the forest and
with a selfrespect born of victory over natures grimmest of terrors

A mile straight south of the school stood the manse which was Hughies
home two miles straight west Ranald lived and Thomas Finch two miles
north while the other lads ought to have taken some of the little
paths that branched east from the main road But this evening with one
accord the boys chose a path that led from the schoolhouse clearing
straight southwest through the forest

What a path that was Beaten smooth with the passing of many bare feet
it wound through the brush and round the big pines past the haunts of
squirrels black gray and red past fox holes and woodchuck holes
under birds nests and beetrees and best of all it brought up at last
at the Deep Hole or Deepole as the boys called it

There were many reasons why the boys should have gone straight home
They were expected home There were cows to get up from the pasture and
to milk potatoes that needed hoeing gardens to weed not to speak of
messages and the like But these were also excellent reasons why the
boys should unanimously choose the cool smoothbeaten sweetscented
shady path that wound and twisted through the trees and brush but led
straight to the Deepole Besides this was Friday night it was hot
and they were tired out the mere thought of the long walk home was
intolerable The Deepole was only two miles away and There was lots
of time for anything else So with wild whoops they turned into the
shady path and sped through the forest the big boys in front with
Ranald easily leading for there was no runner so swift and tireless in
all the countryside and Hughie with the small boys panting behind

On they went a long straggling yelling line down into the cedar
swamp splashing through the Little Crick and up again over the beech
ridge where in the open woods the path grew indistinct and was easy
to lose then again among the great pines where the underbrush was
so thick that you could not tell what might be just before till they
pulled up at the old Lumber Camp The boys always paused at the ruins of
the old Lumber Camp A ruin is ever a place of mystery but to the old
Lumber Camp attached an awful dread for behind it in the thickest part
of the underbrush stood the cabin of Alan Gorrach

Alans was a name of terror among all the small children of the section
Mothers hushed their crying with Alan Gorrach will get you Alan was
a small man short in the legs but with long swinging sinewy arms
He had a gypsy face and tangled long black hair and as he walked
through the forest he might be heard talking to himself with wild
gesticulations He was an itinerant cooper by trade and made for the
farmers wives their buttertubs and butterladles mincingbowls and
coggies and for the men whipstalks axe handles and the like But
in the boys eyes he was guilty of a horrible iniquity He was
a dogkiller His chief business was the doing away with dogs of
illrepute in the country vicious dogs sheepkilling dogs eggsucking
dogs were committed to Alans dread custody and often he would be seen
leading off his wretched victims to his den in the woods whence they
never returned It was a current report that he ate them too No wonder
the boys regarded him with horror mingled with fearful awe

In broad day upon the high road the small boys would boldly fling
taunts and stones at Alan till he would pull out his long sharp
coopers knife and make at them But if they met him in the woods they
would walk past in trembling and respectful silence or slip off into
hiding in the bush till he was out of sight

It was always part of the programme in the exploring of the Lumber
Camp for the big boys to steal down the path to Alans cabin and peer
fearfully through the brush and then come rushing back to the little
boys waiting in the clearing and crying in terrorstricken stage
whispers Hes coming Hes coming set off again through the bush
like hunted deer followed by the panting train of youngsters with
their small hearts thumping hard against their ribs

In a few minutes the pine woods with its old Lumber Camp and Alans
fearsome cabin were left behind and then down along the flats where
the big elms were and the tall ashtrees and the alders the flying
panting line sped on in a final dash for they could smell the river In
a moment more they were at the Deepole

O that Deepole Where the big creek took a great sweep around before
it tore over the rapids and down into the gorge It was always in cool
shade the great fantopped elmtrees hung far out over it and the
alders and the willows edged its banks How cool and clear the dark
brown waters looked And how beautiful the golden mottling on their
smooth flowing surface where the sun rained down through the
overspreading elm boughs And the grassy sward where the boys tore off
their garments and whence they raced and plunged was so green and firm
and smooth under foot And the music of the rapids down in the gorge
and the gurgle of the water where it sucked in under the jam of dead
wood before it plunged into the boiling pool farther down Not that
the boys made note of all these delights accessory to the joys of
the Deepole itself but all these helped to weave the spell that the
swimminghole cast over them Without the spreading elms without
the mottled golden light upon the cool deep waters and without the
distant roar of the little rapid and the soft gurgle at the jam the
Deepole would still have been a place of purest delight but I doubt if
without these it would have stolen in among their day dreams in after
years on hot dusty weary days with power to waken in them a vague
pain and longing for the sweet cool woods and the clear brown waters
Oh for one plunge To feel the hug of the waters their soothing
caress their healing touch These boys are men now such as are on the
hither side of the darker river but not a man of them can think on a
hot summer day of that cool shaded mottled Deepole without a longing
in his heart and a lump in his throat

The last quarter of a mile was always a dead race for it was a point of
distinction to be the first to plunge and the last few seconds of the
race were spent in the preliminaries of the disrobing A single brace
slipped off the shoulder a flutter of a shirt over the head a kick
of the trousers and whoop plunge Hurrah first in The little boys
always waited to admire the first series of plunges for there were many
series before the hour was over and then they would off to their own
crossing going through a similar performance on a small scale

What an hour it was What contests of swimming and diving What water
fights and mud fights What careering of figures stark naked through
the rushes and trees What larks and pranks

And then the little boys would dress A simple process but more
difficult by far than the other for the trousers would stick to the
wet feetno boy would dream of a towel nor dare to be guilty of such
a piece of stuckupnessand the shirt would get wrong side out or
would bundle round the neck or would cling to the wet shoulders till
they had to get on their knees almost to squirm into it But that over
all was over The brace or if the buttons were still there the braces
were easily jerked up on the shoulders and there you were Coats
boots and stockings were superfluous collars and ties utterly
despised

Then the little ones would gather on the grassy bank to watch the big
ones get out which was a process worth watching

Well Im going out boys one would say

Oh pshaw lets have another plunge

All right But its the last though

Then a long stream of naked figures would scramble up the bank and rush
for the last place First out last in was the rule for the boys
would much rather jump on some one else than be jumped on themselves
After the long line of naked figures had vanished into the boiling
water one would be seen quietly stealing out and up the bank kicking
his feet clean as he stepped off the projecting root onto the grass
when plunk a mud ball caught him and back he must come It took them
full two hours to escape clean from the water and woe betide the boy
last out On all sides stood boys little and big with mud balls ready
to fling till out of sheer pity he would be allowed to come forth
clean Then when all were dressed and blue and shiveringfor two
amphibious hours even on a July day make one bluemore games would
begin leapfrog or tag or jumping or climbing trees till they were
warm enough to set out for home

It was as the little ones were playing tag that Hughie came to grief
He was easily king of his company and led the game Quick as a weasel
swift and wary he was always the last to be caught Around the trees
and out and in among the big boys he led the chase much to Tom Finchs
disgust who had not forgotten the spellingmatch incident Not that he
cared for the defeat but he still felt the bite in the masters final
words and he carried a grudge against the boy who had been the occasion
of his humiliation

Keep off he cried angrily as Hughie swung himself round him
But Hughie paid no heed to Toms growl unless indeed to repeat his
offense with the result that as he flew off Tom caught him a kick
that hastened his flight and laid him flat on his back amid the laughter
of the boys

Tom said Hughie gravely and slowly so that they all stood
listening do you know what you kick like

The boys stood waiting

A heipher

In a moment Tom had him by the neck and after a cuff or two sent him
flying with a warning to keep to himself

But Hughie with a saucy answer was off again on his game circling as
near Tom Finch as he dared and being as exasperating as possible till
Tom looked as if he would like a chance to pay him off The chance
came for Hughie leading the tag came flying past Tom and toward the
water Hardly realizing what he was doing Tom stuck out his foot and
caught him flying past and before any one knew how it had happened
poor Hughie shot far out into the Deepole lighting fair on his stomach
There was a great shout of laughter but in a moment every one was
calling Swim Hughie Keep your hands down Dont splash like
that you fool Paddle underneath But Hughie was far too excited or
too stunned by his fall to do anything but splash and sputter and sink
and rise again only to sink once more In a few moments the affair
became serious

The small boys began to cry and some of the bigger ones to undress
when there was a cry from the elmtree overhanging the water

Run out that board Don Quick

It was Ranald who had been swinging up in the highest branches and
had seen what had happened and was coming down from limb to limb like
a squirrel As he spoke he dropped from the lowest limb into the water
close to where Hughie was splashing wildly

In an instant as he rose to the surface Hughies arms went round his
neck and pulled his head under water But he was up again and tugging
at Hughies hands he cried

Dont Hughie let go Ill pull you out Let go But Hughie
halfinsensible with terror and with the water he had gulped in clung
with a deathgrip

Hughie gasped Ranald youll drown us both Oh Hughie man let me
pull you out cant you

Something in the tone caught Hughies ear and he loosed his hold and
Ranald taking him under the chin looked round for the board

By this time Don Cameron was in the water and working the board slowly
toward the gasping boys But now a new danger threatened The current
had gradually carried them toward the log jam under which the water
sucked to the falls below Once under the jam no power on earth could
save

Hurry up Don called out Ranald anxiously Then feeling Hughie
beginning to clutch again he added cheerily Its all right Youll
get us But his face was gray and his eyes were staring for over his
shoulder he could see the jam and he could feel the suck of the water on
his legs

Oh Ranald you cant do it sobbed Hughie Will I paddle
underneath

Yes yes paddle hard Hughie said Ranald for the jam was just at
his back

But as he spoke there was a cry Ranald catch it Over the slippery
logs of the jam came Tom Finch pushing out a plank

Catch it he cried Ill hold this end solid And Ranald caught and
held fast and the boys on the bank gave a mighty shout Soon Don
came up with his board and Tom catching the end hauled it up on the
rolling logs

Hold steady there now cried Tom lying at full length upon the logs
well get you in a minute

By this time the other boys had pulled a number of boards and planks out
of the jam and laying them across the logs made a kind of raft upon
which the exhausted swimmers were gradually hauled and then brought
safe to shore

Oh Ranald said Tom almost weeping I didnt mean toI never
thoughtIm awfully sorry

Oh pshaw said Ranald who was taking off Hughies shirt preparatory
to wringing it I know Besides it was you who pulled us out You were
doing your best Don of course but we would have gone under the jam
but for Tom

For ten minutes the boys stood going over again the various incidents
in the recent dramatic scene extolling the virtues of Ranald Don and
Thomas in turn and imitating with screams of laughter Hughies gulps
and splashings while he was fighting for his life It was their way of
expressing their emotions of gratitude and joy for Hughie was dearly
loved by all though no one would have dared to manifest such weakness

As they were separating Hughie whispered to Ranald Come home with
me Ranald I want you And Ranald looking down into the little
white face went It would be many a day before he would get rid of the
picture of the white face with the staring black eyes floating on the
dark brown water beside him and that was why he went

When they reached the path to the manse clearing Ranald and Hughie were
alone For some minutes Hughie followed Ranald in silence on a dogtrot
through the brule dodging round stumps and roots and climbing over
fallen trees till they came to the pasturefield

Hold on Ranald panted Hughie putting on a spurt and coming up even
with his leader

Are you warm enough asked Ranald looking down at the little flushed
face

You bet

Are you dry

Huh huh

Indeed you are not too dry said Ranald feeling his wet shirt and
trousers and your mother will be wondering

Ill tell her said Hughie in a tone of exulting anticipation

What Ranald stood dead still

Ill tell her replied Hughie Shell be awful glad And shell be
awful thankful to you Ranald

Ranald looked at him in amazement

I think I will jist be going back now he said at length But Hughie
seized him

Oh Ranald you must come with me

He had pictured himself telling his mother of Ranalds exploit and
covering his hero with glory But this was the very thing that Ranald
dreaded and hated and was bound to prevent

You will not be going to the Deepole again I warrant you Ranald
said with emphasis

Not go to the Deepole

No indeed Your mother will put an end to that sort of thing

Mother Why not

She will not be wanting to have you drowned

Hughie laughed scornfully You dont know my mother Shes not afraid
ofof anything

But she will be telling your father

This was a matter serious enough to give Hughie pause His father might
very likely forbid the Deepole

There is no need for telling suggested Ranald And I will just go in
for a minute

Will you stay for supper

Ranald shook his head The manse kitchen was a bright place and to see
the ministers wife and to hear her talk was to Ranald pure delight But
then Hughie might tell and that would be too awful to bear

Do Ranald pleaded Hughie Ill not tell

I am not so sure

Sure as death

Still Ranald hesitated Hughie grew desperate

God may kill me on the spot he cried using the most binding of all
oaths known to the boys This was satisfactory and Ranald went

But Hughie was not skilled in deceiving and especially in deceiving his
mother They were great friends and Hughie shared all his secrets with
her and knew that they were safe unless they ought to be told And so
when he caught sight of his mother waiting for him before the door he
left Ranald and thrilling with the memory of the awful peril through
which he had passed rushed at her and crying Oh mother he flung
himself into her arms I am so glad to see you again

Why Hughie my boy whats the matter said his mother holding her
arms tight about him And you are all wet What is it But Hughie held
her fast struggling with himself

What is it she asked again turning to Ranald

We were running pretty fastand it is a hot dayand But the clear
graybrown eyes were upon him and Ranald found it difficult to go on

Oh mother you mustnt ask cried Hughie I promised not to tell

Not to tell me Hughie The surprise in the voice was quite too much
for Hughie

Oh mother we did not want to frighten youandI promised

Then you must keep your promise Come away in my boy Come in
Ranald

It was her boys first secret from her Ranald saw the look of pain in
the sweet face and could not endure it

It was just nothing Mrs Murray he began

Did you promise too Ranald

No that I did not And there is nothing much to tell only Hughie fell
into the Deepole and the boys pulled him out

Oh mother exclaimed Hughie it was Ranald He jumped right down
from the tree right into the water and kept me up You told yourself
Ranald he continued delighted to be relieved of his promise and on
he went to give his mother in his most picturesque style a description
of the whole scene while Ranald stood looking miserable and ashamed

And Ranald was ashamed for me to tell you and besides he said you
wouldnt let me go to the Deepole again But you will wont you mother
And you wont tell father will you

The mother stood listening with face growing whiter and whiter till
he was done Then she stooped down over the eager face for some moments
whispering My darling my darling and then coming to Ranald she
held her hand on his shoulder for a moment while she said in a voice
bravely struggling to be calm God reward you Ranald God grant my boy
may always have so good and brave a friend when he needs

And from that day Ranalds life was different for he had bound to
him by a tie that nothing could ever break a friend whose influence
followed him and steadied and lifted him up to greatness long after
the grave had hidden her from mens sight



CHAPTER III

THE EXAMINATION


The two years of Archibald Munros regime were the golden age of the
school and for a whole generation The Section regarded that period as
the standard for comparison in the following years Munro had a genius
for making his pupils work They threw themselves with enthusiasm into
all they undertookstudies debate nights games and in everything the
master was the source of inspiration

And now his last examination day had come and the whole Section
was stirred with enthusiasm for their master and with grief at his
departure

The day before examination was spent in cleaning the school This
semiannual event which always preceded the examination was almost as
enjoyable as the examination day itself if indeed it was not more
so The school met in the morning for a final polish for the morrows
recitations Then after a speech by the master the little ones were
dismissed and allowed to go home though they never by any chance took
advantage of this permission Then the master and the bigger boys and
girls set to work to prepare the school for the great day The boys were
told off in sections some to get dry cedar boughs from the swamp for
the big fire outside over which the iron sugarkettle was swung to heat
the scrubbing water others off into the woods for balsamtrees for the
evergreen decorations others to draw water and wait upon the scrubbers

It was a day of delightful excitement but this year there was below the
excitement a deep warm feeling of love and sadness as both teacher
and pupils thought of tomorrow There was an additional thrill to the
excitement that the master was to be presented with a gold watch and
chain and that this had been kept a dead secret from him

What a day it was With wild whoops the boys went off for the dry cedar
and the evergreens while the girls looking very housewifely with
skirts tucked back and sleeves rolled up began to sweep and otherwise
prepare the room for scrubbing

The gathering of the evergreens was a delightful labor High up in the
balsamtrees the more daring boys would climb and then holding by
the swaying top would swing themselves far out from the trunk and come
crashing through the limbs into the deep soft snow bringing half the
tree with them What larks they had What chasing of rabbits along their
beaten runways What fierce and happy snow fights And then the triumph
of their return laden with their evergreen trophies to find the big
fire blazing under the great iron kettle and the water boiling and the
girls well on with the scrubbing

Then while the girls scrubbed first the benches and desks and last of
all the floors the boys washed the windows and put up the evergreen
decorations Every corner had its pillar of green every window had its
frame of green the old blackboard the occasion of many a heartache to
the unmathematical was wreathed into loveliness the maps with their
bewildering boundaries rivers and mountains capes bays and islands
became for once worlds of beauty under the magic touch of the greenery
On the wall just over his desk the master wrought out in evergreen an
arching WELCOME but later on the big girls with some shy blushing
boldly tacked up underneath an answering FAREWELL By the time the
short afternoon had faded into the early evening the school stood
to the eyes of all familiar with the common sordidness of its everyday
dress a picture of artistic loveliness And after the masters little
speech of thanks for their good work that afternoon and for all their
goodness to him the boys and girls went their ways with that strangely
unnameable heartemptiness that brings an ache to the throat but
somehow makes happier for the ache

The examination day was the great school event of the year It was the
social function of the Section as well Toward this event all the school
life moved and its approach was attended by a deepening excitement
shared by children and parents alike which made a kind of holiday
feeling in the air

The school opened an hour later than ordinarily and the children came
all in their Sunday clothes the boys feeling stiff and uncomfortable
and regarding each other with looks half shy and half contemptuous
realizing that they were unnatural in each others sight the girls
with hair in marvelous frizzes and shiny ringlets with new ribbons and
white aprons over their homemade winsey dresses carried their unwonted
grandeur with an ease and delight that made the boys secretly envy but
apparently despise them The one unpardonable crime with all the boys
in that country was that of being proud The boy convicted of shoween
off was utterly contemned by his fellows Hence any delight in new
clothes or in a finer appearance than usual was carefully avoided

Ranald always hated new clothes He felt them an intolerable burden He
did not mind his new homespun homemade flannel check shirt of mixed
red and white but the heavy fulledcloth suit made by his Aunt Kirsty
felt like a suit of mail He moved heavily in it and felt queer and
knew that he looked as he felt The result was that he was in no genial
mood and was on the alert for any indication of levity at his expense

Hughie on the contrary like the girls delighted in new clothes
His new black suit made down from one of his fathers with infinite
planning and pains by his mother and finished only at twelve oclock
the night before gave him unmixed pleasure And handsome he looked in
it All the little girls proclaimed that in their shy admiring glances
while the big girls teased and petted and threatened to kiss him Of
course the boys all scorned him and his finery and tried to take him
down but Hughie was so unfeignedly pleased with himself and moved so
easily and naturally in his grand attire and was so cheery and frank
and happy that no one thought of calling him proud

Soon after ten the sleighloads began to arrive It was a mild winter
day when the snow packed well and there fluttered down through the
still air a few lazy flakes large soft and feathery like bits of the
clouds floating white against the blue sky The sleighs were driven up
to the door with a great flourish and jingle of bells and while the
master welcomed the ladies the fathers and big brothers drove the
horses to the shelter of the thickstanding pines and unhitching them
tied them to the sleighboxes where blanketed and fed they remained
for the day

Within an hour the little schoolhouse was packed the children crowded
tight into the long desks and the visitors on the benches along the
walls and in the seats of the big boys and girls On the platform were
such of the trustees as could muster up the necessary courageold Peter
MacRae who had been a dominie in the Old Country the young minister
and his wife and the schoolteacher from the Sixteenth

First came the wee tots who in wideeyed serious innocence went
through their letters and their ox and cat combinations and
permutations with great gusto and distinction Then they were dismissed
to their seats by a series of mental arithmetic questions sums
of varying difficulty being propounded until little whitehaired
blueeyed Johnnie Aird with the single big curl on the top of his head
was left alone

One and one Johnnie said the master smiling down at the rosy face

Three promptly replied Johnnie and retired to his seat amid the
delighted applause of visitors and pupils and followed by the proud
fond albeit almost tearful gaze of his mother He was her baby born
long after her other babies had grown up into sturdy youth and all the
dearer for that

Then up through the Readers till the Fifth was reached the examination
progressed each class being handed over to the charge of a visitor who
forthwith went upon examination as truly as did the class

Fifth class In due order the class marched up to the chalk line on
the floor in front of the masters desk and stood waiting

The reading lesson was FitzGreene Hallecks Marco Bozzaris a
selection of considerable dramatic power and calling for a somewhat
spirited rendering The master would not have chosen this lesson but he
had laid down the rule that there was to be no special drilling of the
pupils for an exhibition but that the school should be seen doing its
everyday work and in the reading the lessons for the previous day
were to be those of the examination day By an evil fortune the reading
for the day was the dramatic Marco Bozzaris The master shivered
inwardly as he thought of the possibility of Thomas Finch with his
stolidly monotonous voice being called upon to read the thrilling lines
recording the panicstricken deathcry of the Turk To arms They come
The Greek The Greek But Thomas by careful plodding had climbed to
fourth place and the danger lay in the third verse

Will you take this class Mr MacRae said the master handing him the
book He knew that the dominie was not interested in the art of reading
beyond the point of correct pronunciation and hence he hoped the class
might get off easily The dominie took the book reluctantly What he
desired was the arithMETic class and did not care to be put off
with mere reading

Well Ranald let us hear you he rather growled Ranald went at his
work with quiet confidence he knew all the words

Page 187 Marco Bozzaris

At midnight in his guarded tent The Turk lay dreaming of the hour
 When Greece her knee in suppliance bent
 Should tremble at his power

And so on steadily to the end of his verse

Next

The next was Betsy Dan the daughter of Dan Campbell of The Island
Now Betsy Dan was very red in hair and face very shy and very nervous
and always on the point of giggles It was a trial to her to read on
ordinary days but today it was almost more than she could bear To
make matters worse sitting immediately behind her and sheltered from
the eye of the master sat Jimmie Cameron Dons youngest brother
Jimmie was always on the alert for mischief and ever ready to go off
into fits of laughter which he managed to check only by grabbing tight
hold of his nose Just now he was busy pulling at the strings of Betsy
Dans apron with one hand while with the other he was hanging onto his
nose and swaying in paroxysms of laughter

Very red in the face Betsy Dan began her verse

At midnight in the forest shades Bozzaris

Pause while Betsy Dan clutched behind her

Bozzaris ranged

Tchik tchik a snicker from Jimmie in the rear

his Suliote band True as the steel of

imim Betsy Dan struggles with her giggles

Elizabeth The masters voice is stern and sharp

Betsy Dan bridles up while Jimmie is momentarily sobered by the
masters tone

True as the steel of their tried blades Heroes in heart and hand
 There had the Persians thousands stood

Tchik tchik tchik a long snicker from Jimmie whose nose cannot
be kept quite in control It is becoming too much for poor Betsy Dan
whose lips begin to twitch

There

imim thittittit Betsy Dan is making mighty efforts to hold in
her giggles

had the glad earth tchik drunk their blood On old Plaatteas day

Whack whack

Elizabeth Campbell The masters tone was quite terrible

I dont care He wont leave me alone Hes justjust sob
pupulling at me sob all the time

By this time Betsys apron was up to her eyes and her sobs were quite
tempestuous

James stand up Jimmie slowly rose red with laughter and covered
with confusion

III didnt touch her he protested

Oh said little Aleck Sinclair who had been enjoying Jimmies prank
hugely he was

Thatll do Aleck I didnt ask you James is quite able to tell me
himself Now James

III was only just doing that said Jimmie sober enough now and
terrified at the results of his mischief

Doing what said the master repressing a smile at Jimmies woebegone
face

Justjust that and Jimmie touched gingerly with the point of his
finger the bows of Betsy Dans apronstrings

Oh I see You were annoying Elizabeth while she was reading No wonder
she found it difficult Now do you think that was very nice

Jimmie twisted himself into a semicircle

Noo

Come here James Jimmie looked frightened came round the class and
up to the master

Now then continued the master facing Jimmie round in front of Betsy
Dan who was still using her apron upon her eyes tell Elizabeth you
are sorry

Jimmie stood in an agony of silent awkwardness curving himself in
varying directions

Are you sorry

Yees

Well tell her so

Jimmie drew a long breath and braced himself for the ordeal He stood a
moment or two working his eyes up shyly from Betsy Dans shoes to
her face caught her glancing at him from behind her apron and began
IIIm tchik tchik sorry tchik Betsy Dans look was too much
for the little chaps gravity

A roar swept over the schoolhouse Even the grim dominies face
relaxed

Go to your seat and behave yourself said the master giving Jimmie a
slight cuff Now Margaret let us go on

Margarets was the difficult verse But to Margarets quiet voice and
gentle heart anything like shriek or battlecry was foreign enough so
with even tone and unmodulated by any shade of passion she read the
cry To arms They come The Greek The Greek Nor was her voice to
be moved from its gentle monotonous flow even by the battlecry of
Bozzaris Strike till the last armed foe expires

Next said the dominie glad to get on with his task

The master breathed freely when alas for his hopes the minister spoke
up

But Margaret do you think Bozzaris cheered his men in so gentle a
voice as that

Margaret smiled sweetly but remained silent glad to get over the
verse

Wouldnt you like to try it again suggested the minister

Margaret flushed up at once

Oh no said his wife who had noticed Margarets flushing face
Girls are not supposed to be soldiers are they Margaret

Margaret flashed a grateful look at her

Thats a boys verse

Ay that it is said the old dominie and I would wish very much that
Mrs Murray would conduct this class

But the ministers wife would not hear of it protesting that the
dominie could do it much better The old man however insisted saying
that he had no great liking for this part of the examination and
would wish to reserve himself with the masters permission for the
arithMETic class

Mrs Murray seeing that it would please the dominie took the book
with a spot of color coming in her delicate highbred face

You must all do your best now to help me she said with a smile that
brought an answering smile flashing along the line Even Thomas Finch
allowed his stolid face a gleam of intelligent sympathy which however
he immediately suppressed for he remembered that the next turn was
his and that he must be getting himself into the appearance of dogged
desperation which he considered suitable to a reading exercise

Now Thomas said the ministers wife sweetly and Thomas plunged
heavily

They fought like brave men long

Oh Thomas I think we will try that mans verse again with the cries
of battle in it you know I am sure you can do that well

It was all the same to Thomas There were no words he could not spell
and he saw no reason why he should not do that verse as well as
any other So with an extra knitting of his eyebrows he set forth
doggedly

AnhourpassedontheTurkawokethatbrightdreamwashislast

Thomass voice fell with the unvarying regularity of the beat of a
triphammer

HewoketohearhissentriesshriektoarmstheycometheGreek
theGreekhewoke

But Thomas wait a minute You see you must speak these words To
arms They come differently from the others These words were shrieked
by the sentries and you must show that in your reading

Speak them out man said the minister sharply and a little
nervously fearing that his wife had undertaken too great a task and
hating to see her defeated

Now Thomas said Mrs Murray try again And remember the sentries
shrieked these words To arms and so on

Thomas squared his shoulders spread his feet apart added a wrinkle
to his frown and a deeper note of desperation to his tone and began
again

AnhourpassedontheTurkawokethatbrightdreamwas

The master shuddered

Now Thomas excuse me Thats better but we can improve that yet
Mrs Murray was not to be beaten The attention of the whole school
even to Jimmie Cameron as well as that of the visitors was now
concentrated upon the event

See she went on each phrase by itself An hour passed on the Turk
awoke Now try that far

Again Thomas tried this time with complete success The visitors
applauded

Ah thats it Thomas I was sure you could do it

Thomas relaxed a little but not unduly He was not sure what was yet
before him

Now we will get that sentries shriek See Thomas like this a
little and she read the words with fine expression

You must put more pith more force into those words Thomas Speak
out man interjected the minister who was wishing it was all over

Now Thomas I think this will be the last time You have done very
well but I feel sure you can do better

The ministers wife looked at Thomas as she said this with so
fascinating a smile that the frown on Thomas face deepened into a
hideous scowl and he planted himself with a doordie expression in
every angle of his solid frame Realizing the extreme necessity of the
moment he pitched his voice several tones higher than ever before in
his life inside a house and before people and made his final attempt

Anhourpassedon theTurkawoke ThatbrightdreamWAShislast

And now feeling that the crisis was upon him and confusing speed
with intensity and sound with passion he rushed his words with
everincreasing speed into a wild yell

Hewoketohearhissentriesshriektoarmsthey
cometheGreekTHEGREEK

There was a moment of startled stillness then tchik tchik It was
Jimmie again holding his nose and swaying in a vain effort to control a
paroxysm of snickers at Thomas unusual outburst

It was like a match to powder Again the whole school burst into a
roar of uncontrollable laughter Even the minister the master and the
dominie could not resist The only faces unmoved were those of Thomas
Finch and the ministers wife He had tried his best and it was to
please her and she knew it

A swift shamed glance round and his eyes rested on her face That
face was sweet and grave as she leaned toward him and said Thank you
Thomas That was well done And Thomas still looking at her flushed
to his hair roots and down the back of his neck while the scowl on his
forehead faded into a frown and then into smoothness

And if you always try your best like that Thomas you will be a great
and good man some day

Her voice was low and soft as if intended for him alone but in the
sudden silence that followed the laughter it thrilled to every heart in
the room and Thomas was surprised to find himself trying to swallow a
lump in his throat and to keep his eyes from blinking and in his face
stolid and heavy a new expression was struggling for utterance Here
take me it said all that I have is thine and later days brought
the opportunity to prove it

The rest of the reading lesson passed without incident Indeed there
pervaded the whole school that feeling of reaction which always succeeds
an emotional climax The master decided to omit the geography and
grammar classes which should have immediately followed and have dinner
at once and so allow both children and visitors time to recover tone
for the spelling and arithmetic of the afternoon

The dinner was an elaborate and appalling variety of pies and cakes
served by the big girls and their sisters who had recently left
school and who consequently bore themselves with all proper dignity and
importance Two of the boys passed round a pail of water and a tin cup
that all the thirsty might drink From hand to hand and from lip to
lip the cup passed with a fine contempt of microbes The only point
of etiquette insisted upon was that no leavings should be allowed to
remain in the cup or thrown back into the pail but should be carefully
flung upon the floor

There had been examination feasts in prehistoric days in the Twentieth
school when the boys indulged in free fights at long range using as
missiles remnants of pie crust and cake whose consistency rendered them
deadly enough to bloody a nose or black an eye But these barbaric
encounters ceased with Archie Munros advent and now the boys vied with
each other in minding their manners Not only was there no snatching
of food or exhibition of greediness but there was a severe repression
of any apparent eagerness for the tempting dainties lest it should be
suspected that such were unusual at home Even the little boys felt that
it would be bad manners to take a second piece of cake or pie unless
specially pressed but their eager bulging eyes revealed only too
plainly their hearts desire and the kindly waiters knew their duty
sufficiently to urge a second third and fourth supply of the toothsome
currant or berry pie the solid fruit cake or the oily doughnut till
the point was reached where desire failed

Have some more Jimmie Have a doughnut said the master who had been
admiring Jimmies gastronomic achievements

Hes had ten aready shouted little Aleck Sinclair Jimmies special
confidant

Jimmie smiled in conscious pride but remained silent

What eaten ten doughnuts asked the master feigning alarm

Hes got four in his pocket too said Aleck in triumph

Hes got a pie in his own pocket retorted Jimmie driven to
retaliate

A pie exclaimed the master Better take it out A pockets not the
best place for a pie Why dont you eat it Aleck

I cant lamented Aleck Im full up

He said hes nearly busted said Jimmie anxiously Hes got a
pain here pointing to his left eye The bigger boys and some of the
visitors who had gathered round shouted with laughter

Oh pshaw Aleck said the master encouragingly thats all right
As long as the pain is as high up as your eye youll recover I tell you
what put your pie down on the desk here Jimmie will take care of it
and run down to the gate and tell Don I want him

Aleck with great care and considerable difficulty extracted from his
pocket a segment of black currant pie hopelessly battered but still
intact He regarded it fondly for a moment or two and then with a very
dubious look at Jimmie ran away on his errand for the master

It took him some little time to find Don and meanwhile the masters
attention was drawn away by his duty to the visitors The pie left to
Jimmies care had an unfortunately tempting fringe of loose pieces about
it that marred its symmetry Jimmie proceeded to trim it into shape So
absorbed did he become in this trimming process that before he realized
what he was about he woke suddenly to the startling fact that the pie
had shrunk into a comparatively insignificant size It would be worse
than useless to save the mutilated remains for Aleck there was nothing
for it now but to get the reproachful remnant out of the way He was
so busily occupied with this praiseworthy proceeding that he failed to
notice Aleck enter the room flushed with his race eager and once more
empty

Arriving at his seat he came upon Jimmie engaged in devouring the pie
left in his charge With a cry of dismay and rage he flung himself upon
the little gourmand and after a short struggle secured the precious
pie but alas bereft of its most delicious partit was picked clean
of its currants For a moment he gazed griefstricken at the leathery
viscous remnant in his hand Then with a wrathful exclamation Here
then you can just take it then you big pig you He seized Jimmie by
the neck and jammed the sticky pie crust on his face where it stuck
like an adhesive plaster Jimmie taken by surprise and rendered
nerveless by the pangs of an accusing conscience made no resistance
but set up a howl that attracted the attention of the master and the
whole company

Why Jimmie exclaimed the master removing the doughy mixture from
the little lads face what on earth are you trying to do What is
wrong Aleck

He ate my pie said Aleck defiantly

Ate it Well apparently not But never mind Aleck we shall get you
another pie

There isnt any more said Aleck mournfully that was the last
piece

Oh well we shall find something else just as good said the master
going off after one of the big girls and returning with a doughnut
and a peculiarly deadly looking piece of fruit cake he succeeded in
comforting the disappointed and still indignant Aleck

The afternoon was given to the more serious part of the school
workwriting arithmetic and spelling while for those whose
ambitions extended beyond the limits of the public school the master
had begun a Euclid class which was at once his despair and his
pride In the Twentieth school of that date there was no waste of the
childrens time in foolish and fantastic branches of study in showy
exercises and accomplishments whose display was at once ruinous to
the nerves of the visitors and to the selfrespect and modesty of
the children The ideal of the school was to fit the children for the
struggle into which their lives would thrust them so that the boy who
could spell and read and cipher was supposed to be ready for his life
work Those whose ambition led them into the subtleties of Euclids
problems and theorems were supposed to be in preparation for somewhat
higher spheres of life

Through the various classes of arithmetic the examination proceeded the
little ones struggling with great seriousness through their addition
and subtraction sums and being wrought up to the highest pitch of
excitement by their contest for the first place By the time the fifth
class was reached the air was heavy with the feeling of battle Indeed
it was amazing to note how the master had succeeded in arousing in the
whole school an intense spirit of emulation From little Johnnie Aird up
to Thomas Finch the pupils carried the hearts of soldiers

Through fractions the Rule of Three percentages and stocks the
senior class swept with a trail of glory In vain old Peter MacRae
strewed their path with his favorite posers The brilliant achievements
of the class seemed to sink him deeper and deeper into the gloom of
discontent while the master the minister and his wife as well as
the visitors could not conceal their delight As a last resort the old
dominie sought to stem their victorious career with his famous problem
in Practice and to his huge enjoyment one after another of the class
had to acknowledge defeat The truth was the master had passed lightly
over this rule in the arithmetic considering the solution of problems
by the method of Practice as a little antiquated and hardly worthy of
much study The failure of the class however brought the dominie his
hour of triumph and so complete had been the success of the examination
that the master was abundantly willing that he should enjoy it

Then followed the judging of the copybooks The best and cleanest book
in each class was given the proud distinction of a testimonial written
upon the first blank page with the date of the examination and the
signatures of the examiners attached It was afterwards borne home in
triumph by the happy owner to be stored among the family archives
and perhaps among the sacred things that mothers keep in their holy of
holies

After the copybooks had been duly appraised there followed an hour
in which the excitement of the day reached its highest mark The whole
school with such of the visitors as could be persuaded to join were
ranged in opposing ranks in the deadly conflict of a spellingmatch The
master the teacher from the Sixteenth and even the ministers wife
yielded to the tremendous pressure of public demand that they should
enter the fray The contest had a most dramatic finish and it was felt
that the extreme possibility of enthusiasm and excitement was reached
when the ministers wife spelled down the teacher from the Sixteenth
who every one knew was the champion speller of all the country that lay
toward the Front and had a special private armory of deadly missiles
laid up against just such a conflict as this The tumultuous triumph
of the children was not to be controlled Again and again they followed
Hughie in wild yells not only because his mother was a great favorite
with them all but because she had wrested a victory from the champion
of the Front for the Front in all matters pertaining to culture and
fashion thought itself quite superior to the more backwoods country of
the Twentieth

It was with no small difficulty that the master brought the school to
such a degree of order that the closing speeches could be received with
becoming respect and attention The trustees according to custom were
invited to express their opinion upon the examination and upon school
matters generally The chairman John Cameron Long John as he was
called broke the ice after much persuasion and slowly rising from
the desk into which he had compressed his long lank form he made his
speech Long John was a great admirer of the master but for all that
and perhaps because of that he allowed himself no warmer words of
commendation than that he was well pleased with the way in which
the children had conducted themselves They have done credit to
themselves he said and to their teacher And indeed I am sorry he is
leaving us for so far I have heard no complaints in the Section

The other trustees followed in the path thus blazed out for them by Long
John They were all well pleased with the examination and they were
all sorry to lose the master and they had heard no complaints It
was perfectly understood that no words of praise could add to the high
testimony that they had heard no complaints

The dominies speech was a little more elaborate Somewhat reluctantly
he acknowledged that the school had acquitted itself with very
considerable credit especially the arithMETic class and indeed
considering all the circumstances Mr Munro was to be congratulated
upon the results of his work in the Section But the ministers warm
expression of delight at the days proceedings and of regret at the
departure of the master more than atoned for the trustees cautious
testimony and the dominies somewhat grudging praise

Then came the moment of the day A great stillness fell upon the school
as the master rose to make his farewell speech But before he could
say a word up from their seats walked Betsy Dan and Thomas Finch
and ranged themselves before him The whole assemblage tingled with
suppressed excitement The great secret with which they had been
burdening themselves for the past few weeks was now to be out Slowly
Thomas extracted the manuscript from his trousers pocket and smoothed
out its many folds while Betsy Dan waited nervously in the rear

Oh why did they set Thomas to this whispered the ministers wife
who had a profound sense of humor The truth was the choice of the
school had fallen upon Ranald and Margaret Aird Margaret was quite
willing to act but Ranald refused pointblank and privately persuaded
Thomas to accept the honor in his stead To this Thomas agreed all the
more readily that Margaret whom he adored from a respectful distance
was to be his partner But Margaret who would gladly have been
associated with Ranald on the suggestion that Thomas should take his
place put up her lower lip in that symbol of scorn so effective with
girls but which no boy has ever yet accomplished and declared that
indeed and she would see that Tom Finch far enough which plainly
meant no Consequently they had to fall back upon Betsy Dan who in
addition to being excessively nervous was extremely goodnatured
And Thomas though he would greatly have preferred Margaret as his
assistant was quite ready to accept Betsy Dan

The interval of waiting while Thomas deliberately smoothed out the
creases of the paper was exceedingly hard upon Betsy Dan whose face
grew redder each moment Jimmie Cameron too who realized that the
occasion was one of unusual solemnity was gazing at Thomas with
intense interest growing into amusement and was holding his fingers
in readiness to seize his nose and so check any explosion of snickers
Just as Thomas had got the last fold of his paper straightened out and
was turning it right end up it somehow slipped through his fingers to
the floor This was too much for Jimmie who only saved himself from
utter disgrace by promptly seizing his nose and holding on for dear
life Thomas gave Jimmie a passing glare and straightened himself up
for his work With a furious frown he cleared his throat and began in
a solemn deeptoned roar Dear teacher learning with regret that you
are about to sever your connection etc etc All went well until
he came to the words We beg you to accept this gift not for its
intrinsic value etc which was the cue for Betsy Dan But Betsy Dan
was engaged in terrorizing Jimmie and failed to come in till after an
awful pause Thomas gave her a sharp nudge and whispered audibly Give
it to him you gowk Poor Betsy Dan in sudden confusion whipped her
hand out from under her apron and thrusting a box at the master said
hurriedly Here it is sir As Thomas solemnly concluded his address
a smile ran round the room while Jimmie doubled himself up in his
efforts to suppress a tempest of snickers

The master however seemed to see nothing humorous in the situation
but bowing gravely to Thomas and Betsy Dan he said kindly Thank you
Thomas Thank you Elizabeth Something in his tone brought the school
to attention and even Jimmie forgot to have regard to his nose For
a few moments the master stood looking upon the faces of his pupils
dwelling upon them one by one till his eyes rested upon the wee tots in
the front seat looking at him with eyes of innocent and serious wonder
Then he thanked the children for their gift in a few simple words
assuring them that he should always wear the watch with pride and
grateful remembrance of the Twentieth school and of his happy days
among them

But when he came to say his words of farewell and to thank them for
their goodness to him and their loyal backing of him while he was their
teacher his voice grew husky and for a moment wavered Then after
a pause he spoke of what had been his ideal among them It is a good
thing to have your minds trained and stored with useful knowledge but
there are better things than that To learn honor truth and right to
be manly and womanly to be selfcontrolled and brave and gentlethese
are better than all possible stores of learning and if I have taught
you these at all then I have done what I most wished to do I have
often failed and I have often been discouraged and might have given up
were it not for the help I received at my worst times from our minister
and from Mrs Murray who often saved me from despair

A sudden flush tinged the grave beautiful face of the ministers young
wife A light filled her eyes as the master said these words for she
remembered days when the young mans pain was almost greater than he
could bear and when he was near to giving up

When the master ceased the minister spoke a few words in appreciation
of the work he had done in the school and in the whole Section during
his three years stay among them and expressed his conviction that many
a young lad would grow into a better man because he had known Archibald
Munro and some of them would never forget what he had done for them

By this time all the big girls and many of the visitors were openly
weeping The boys were looking straight in front of them their faces
set in an appearance of savage gloom for they knew well how near they
were to acting like the girls

After a short prayer by the minister the children filed out past the
master who stood at the door and shook hands with them one by one When
the big boys and the young men who had gone to school in the winter
months came to say good by they shook hands silently and then stood
close about him as if hating to let him go He had caught for them in
many a close baseball match he had saved their goal in many a fierce
shinny fight with the Front and while he had ruled them with an iron
rule he had always treated them fairly He had never failed them he
had never weakened he had always been a man among them No wonder they
stood close about him and hated to lose him Suddenly big Bob Fraser
called out in a husky voice Three cheers for the captain and every
one was glad of the chance to let himself out in a roar And that was
the last of the farewells



CHAPTER IV

THE NEW MASTER


Right in front of the school door and some little distance from it in
the midst of a clump of maples stood an old beechtree with a dead top
and halfway down where a limb had once been and had rotted off a
hole Inside this hole two very respectable but thoroughly impudent red
squirrels had made their nest The hole led into the dead heart of the
tree which had been hollowed out with pains so as to make a roomy cosy
home which the squirrels had lined with fur and moss and which was
well stored with beechnuts from the tree their winters provisions

Between the boys and the squirrels there existed an armed neutrality It
was understood among the boys that nothing worse than snowballs was to
be used in their war with the squirrels while with the squirrels it
was a matter of honor that they should put reasonable limits to their
profanity But there were times when the relations became strained and
hence the holidays were no less welcome to the squirrels than to the
boys

To the squirrels this had been a day of unusual anxiety for the school
had taken up again after its two weeks holidays and the boys were a
little more inquisitive than usual and unfortunately the snow happened
to be good for packing It had been a bad day for nerves and Mr Bushy
as the boys called him found it impossible to keep his tail in one
position for more than one second at a time It was in vain that his
more sedate and selfcontrolled partner in life remonstrated with him
and urged a more philosophic mind

Its all very well for you my dear Mr Bushy was saying rather
crossly I am afraid to urge a philosophic mind but if you had the
responsibility of the family upon youGoodness gracious Owls and
weasels What in all the woods is that

Cant be the wolves said Mrs Bushy placidly its too early for
them

Might have known replied her husband quite crossly of course its
those boys I wonder why they let them out of school at all Why cant
they keep them in where it is warm It always seems to me a very silly
thing anyway for them to keep rushing out of their hole in that stupid
fashion What they do in there I am sure I dont know It isnt the
least like a nest Ive seen inside of it There isnt a thing to eat
nor a bit of hair or moss They just go in and out again

Well my dear said his wife soothingly you can hardly expect them
to know as much as people with a wider outlook We must remember they
are only ground people

Thats just it grumbled Mr Bushy I only wish they would just keep
to themselves and on the ground where they belong but they have the
impudence to come lumbering up here into our tree

Oh well replied his partner calmly you must acknowledge they do
not disturb our nest

And a good thing for them too chattered Mr Bushy fiercely
smoothing out his whiskers and showing his sharp front teeth at which
Mrs Bushy smiled gently behind her tail

But what are they doing now she inquired

Oh they are going off into the woods said Mr Bushy who had
issued from his hole and was sitting up on a convenient crotch And I
declare he said in amazed tones they havent thrown one snowball at
me Something must be badly wrong with them Wonder what it is This is
quite unprecedented

At this Mrs Bushy ventured carefully out to observe the extraordinary
phenomenon for the boys were actually making their way to the gate the
smaller ones with much noisy shouting but the big boys soberly enough
engaged in earnest conversation It was their first day of the new
master and such a day as quite flabbergastrated as Don Cameron said
even the oldest of them But of course Mr and Mrs Bushy knew nothing
of this and could only marvel

Murdie cried Hughie to Dons big brother who with Bob Fraser Ranald
Macdonald and Thomas Finch was walking slowly toward the gate you
wont forget to ask your pa for an excuse if you happen to be late
tomorrow will you

Murdie paid no attention

You wont forget your excuse Murdie continued Hughie poking him in
the back

Murdie suddenly turned caught him by the neck and the seat of his
trousers and threw him head first into a drift from which he emerged
wrathful and sputtering

Well I hope you do continued Hughie and then youll catch it And
mind you he went on circling round to get in front of him if you
want to ask big Bob there for his knife mind you hold up your hand
first Murdie only grinned at him

The new master had begun the day by enunciating the regulations under
which the school was to be administered They made rather a formidable
list but two of them seemed to the boys to have gone beyond the limits
of all that was outrageous and absurd There was to be no speaking
during school hours and if a boy should desire to ask a question of his
neighbor he was to hold up his hand and get permission from the master
But worse than all and more absurd than all was the regulation that
all late comers and absentees were to bring written excuses from parents
or guardians

Guardian Thomas Finch had grunted whats that

Your grandmother whispered Don back

It was not Dons reply that brought Thomas into disgrace this first
day of the new masters rule it was the vision of big Murdie Cameron
walking up to the desk with an excuse for lateness which he had
obtained from Long John his father This vision breaking suddenly in
upon the solemnity of Thomas Finchs mind had sent him into a snort of
laughter not more to the surprise of the school than of himself The
gravity of the school had not been greatly helped by Thomas sheepish
answer to the masters indignant question What did you do that for
sir

I didnt it did itself

On the whole the opening day had not been a success As a matter of
fact it was almost too much to expect that it should be anything but
a failure There was a kind of settled if unspoken opinion among the
children that no master could ever fill Archibald Munros place in the
school Indeed it was felt to be a kind of impertinence for any man to
attempt such a thing And further there was a secret sentiment among
the boys that loyalty to the old masters memory demanded an attitude of
unsympathetic opposition to the one who came to take his place It did
not help the situation that the new master was unaware of this state of
mind He was buoyed up by the sentiments of enthusiastic admiration
and approval that he carried with him in the testimonials from his last
board of trustees in town with which sentiments he fully agreed and
hence he greeted the pupils of the little backwoods school with an airy
condescension that reduced the school to a condition of speechless and
indignant astonishment The school was prepared to tolerate the man who
should presume to succeed their former master if sufficiently humble
but certainly not to accept airy condescension from him

Does he think were babies asked Don indignantly

And did you see him trying to chop at recess REEcis Hughie called
it He couldnt hit twice in the same place

And he asked me if that beech there was a maple said Bob Fraser in
deep disgust

Oh shut up your gab said Ranald suddenly Give the man a chance
anyway

Will YOU bring an excuse when youre absent Ranald asked Hughie

And where would I be getting it asked Ranald grimly and all the
boys realized the absurdity of expecting a written excuse for Ranalds
absence from his father Macdonald Dubh was not a man to be bothered
with such trifles

You might get it from your Aunt Kirsty Ranald said Don slyly The
boys shouted at the suggestion

And she could do it well enough if it would be necessary said Ranald
facing square round on Don and throwing up his head after his manner
when battle was in the air while the red blood showed in his dark cheek
and his eyes lit up with a fierce gleam Don read the danger signal

Im not saying she couldnt he hurried to say apologetically but
it would be funny wouldnt it

Well said Ranald relenting and smiling a little it would be
keeping her busy at times

When the deer are running eh Ranald said Murdie goodnaturedly
But Ranalds right boys he continued give the man a chance say
I

Theres our bells cried Thomas Finch as the deep musical boom of
the Finchs sleighbells came through the bush Come on Hughie well
get them at the cross And followed by Hughie and the boys from the
north he set off for the north crossroads where they would meet
the Finchs bobsleighs coming empty from the sawmill to the great
surprise and unalloyed delight of Mr and Mrs Bushy who from their
crotch in the old beech had watched with some anxiety the boys unusual
conduct

There they are Hughie called Thomas as the sleighs came out into
the open at the crossroads Theyll wait for us They know youre
coming he yelled encouragingly for the big boys had left the smaller
ones a panting train far in the rear and were piling themselves
upon the Finchs sleighs with never a by your leave to William
Johnfamiliarly known as Billy JackThomas eldest brother who drove
the Finchs team

Thomas home lay a mile north and another east from the Twentieth
crossroads but the winter road by which they hauled sawlogs to the
mill cut right through the forest where the deep snow packed hard
into a smooth track covering roots and logs and mud holes and making
a perfect surface for the sleighs however heavily loaded except where
here and there the pitchholes or cahots came These cahots by the way
though they became especially toward the spring a serious annoyance
to teamsters only added another to the delights that a sleighride held
for the boys

To Hughie the ride this evening was blissful to an unspeakable degree
He was overflowing with new sensations He was going to spend the night
with Thomas for one thing and Thomas as his host was quite a new and
different person from the Thomas of the school The ministers wife
ever since the examination day had taken a deeper interest in Thomas
and determined that something should be made out of the solemn stolid
slowmoving boy Partly for this reason she had yielded to Hughies
eager pleading backing up the invitation brought by Thomas himself
and delivered in an agony of redfaced confusion that Hughie should be
allowed to go home with him for the night Partly too because she
was glad that Hughie should see something of the Finchs home and
especially of the darkfaced darkeyed little woman who so silently and
unobtrusively but so efficiently administered her home her family
and their affairs and especially her husband without suspicion on his
part that anything of the kind was being done

In addition to the joy that Hughie had in Thomas in his new role as
host this winter road was full of wonder and delight as were all roads
and paths that wound right through the heart of the bush The regular
madeup roads with the forest cut back beyond the ditches at the sides
were a great weariness to Hughie except indeed in the springtime when
these ditches were running full with sunlit water over the mottled
clay bottom and gravelly ripples But the bush roads and paths summer
and winter were filled with things of wonder and of beauty and this
particular winter road of the Finchs was best of all to Hughie for it
was quite new to him and besides it led right through the mysterious
big pine swamp and over the butternut ridge beyond which lay the
Finchs farm Balsamtrees tamarack spruce and cedar made up the
thick underbrush of the pine swamp white birch white ash and black
were thickly sprinkled through it but high above these lesser trees
towered the white pines lifting their great tufted crests in lonely
grandeur seeming like kings among meaner men Here and there the rabbit
runways packed into hard little paths crossed the road and disappeared
under the thick spruces and balsams here and there the sly single
track of the fox or the deep hoofmark of the deer led off into
unknown depths on either side Hughie sitting up on the bolster of the
front bob beside Billy Jack for even the big boys recognized his right
as Thomas guest to that coveted place listened with eager face and
wideopen eyes to Billy Jacks remarks upon the forest and its strange
people

One thing else added to Hughies keen enjoyment of the ride Billy
Jacks bays were always in the finest of fettle and pulled hard on the
lines and were rarely allowed the rapture of a gallop But when the
swamp was passed and the road came to the more open butternut ridge
Billy Jack shook the lines over their backs and let them out Their
response was superb to witness and brought Hughie some moments of
ecstatic rapture Along the hardpacked road that wound about among the
big butternuts the rangey bays sped at a flat gallop bounding clear
over the cahots the booming of the bells and the rattling of the chains
furnishing an exhilarating accompaniment to the swift swaying motion
while the children clung for dear life to the bobsleighs and to each
other It was all Billy Jack could do to get his team down to a trot by
the time they reached the clearing for there the going was perilous
and besides it was just as well that his father should not witness
any signs on Billy Jacks part of the folly that he was inclined to
attribute to the rising generation So steadily enough the bays trotted
up the lane and between long lines of green cordwood on one side and
a haystack on the other into the yard and swinging round the big
strawstack that faced the open shed and was flanked on the right by
the cowstable and hogpen and on the left by the horsestable came to
a full stop at their own stable door

Thomas you take Hughie into the house to get warm till I unhitch
said Billy Jack with the feeling that courtesy to the ministers son
demanded this attention But Hughie rejecting this proposition with
scorn pushed Thomas aside and set himself to unhitch the Shook on the
outside trace of the nigh bay It was one of Hughies grievances and
a very sore point with him that his fathers people would insist
on treating him in the privileged manner they thought proper to his
fathers son and his chief ambition was to stand upon his own legs
and to fare like other boys So he scorned Billy Jacks suggestion and
while some of the children scurried about the stacks for a little romp
before setting off for their homes which some of them for the sake of
the ride had left far behind Hughie devoted himself to the unhitching
of the team with Billy Jack And so quick was he in his movements
and so fearless of the horses that he had his side unhitched and was
struggling with the breaststrap before Billy Jack had finished with his
horse

Man youre a regular farmer said Billy Jack admiringly only
youre too quick for the rest of us

Hughie still struggling with the breaststrap found his heart swell
with pride To be a farmer was his present dream

But thats too heavy for you continued Billy Jack Here let down
the tongue first

Pshaw said Hughie disgusted at his exhibition of ignorance I knew
that tongue ought to come out first but I forgot

Oh well its just as good that way but not quite so easy said
Billy Jack with doubtful consistency

It took Hughie but a few minutes after the tongue was let down to
unfasten his end of the neckyoke and the crosslines and he was
beginning at his hamestrap always a difficult buckle when Billy Jack
called out Hold on there Youre too quick for me Well make them
carry their own harness into the stable Dont believe in making a horse
of myself Billy Jack was something of a humorist

The Finch homestead was a model of finished neatness Order was its law
Outside the stables barns stacks the very woodpiles evidenced that
law Within the house and its belongings and affairs were perfect
in their harmonious arrangement The whole establishment without and
within gave token of the unremitting care of one organizing mind for
from dark to dark while others might have their moments of rest and
careless ease the little mother as Billy Jack called her was ever
on guard and all the machinery of house and farm moved smoothly and to
purpose because of that unsleeping care She was last to bed and first
to stir and Billy Jack declared that she used to put the cats to sleep
at night and waken up the roosters in the morning And through it all
her face remained serene and her voice flowed in quiet tones Billy
Jack adored her with all the might of his big heart and body Thomas
slow of motion as of expression found in her the center of his somewhat
sluggish being Jessac the little darkfaced maiden of nine years
whose face was the very replica of her mothers knew nothing in the
world dearer albeit in her daily little housewifely tasks she felt
the gentle pressure of that steadfast mind and unyielding purpose Her
husband regarded her with a curious mingling of reverence and defiance
for Donald Finch was an obstinate man with a mans love of authority
and a Scotchmans sense of his right to rule in his own house But while
he talked much about his authority and made a great show of absolutism
with his family he was secretly conscious that another will than
his had really kept things moving about the farm for he had long ago
learned that his wife was always right while he might often be wrong
and that withal her soft words and gentle ways hers was a will like
steel

Besides the law of order another law ruled in the Finch householdthe
law of work The days were filled with work for they each had their
share to do and bore the sole responsibility for its being well done
If the cows failed in their milk or the fat cattle were not up to the
mark the father felt the reproach as his to Billy Jack fell the care
and handling of the horses Thomas took charge of the pigs and the
getting of wood and water for the house little Jessac had her daily
task of sorting the rooms and when the days were too stormy or the
snow too deep for school she had in addition her stent of knitting or
of winding the yarn for the weaver To the mother fell all the rest At
the cooking and the cleaning and the making and the mending all fine
arts with her she diligently toiled from long before dawn till after
all the rest were abed But besides these and other daily household
duties there were in their various seasons the jam and jelly the
pumpkin and squash preserves the buttermaking and cheesemaking and
more than all the long long work with the wool Billy Jack used to say
that the little mother followed that wool from the backs of her sheep
to the backs of her family and hated to let the weaver have his turn
at it What with the washing and the oiling of it the carding and the
spinning the twisting and the winding she never seemed to be done And
then when it came back from the weaver in great webs of fulledcloth
and flannel and winsey there was all the cutting shaping and sewing
before the family could get it on their backs True the tailor was
called in to help but though he declared he worked no place else as he
worked at the Finchs it was Billy Jacks openly expressed opinion that
he worked his jaw more than his needle for at mealtimes he gave his
needle a rest

But though Hughie of course knew nothing of this toiling and moiling
he was distinctly conscious of an air of tidiness and comfort and
quiet and was keenly alive to the fact that there was a splendid supper
waiting him when he got in from the stables with the others hungry as
a wildcat as Billy jack expressed it And that WAS a supper Fried
ribs of fresh pork and hashed potatoes hot and brown followed by
buckwheat pancakes hot and brown with maple syrup There was tea for
the father and mother with their oat cakes but for the children no such
luxury only the choice of buttermilk or sweet milk Hughie it is true
was offered tea but he promptly declined for though he loved it well
enough it was sufficient reason for him that Thomas had none It took
however all the grace out of his declining that Mr Finch remarked
in gruff pleasantry What would a boy want with tea The supper was
a very solemn meal They were all too busy to talk at least so Hughie
felt and as for himself he was only afraid lest the others should
push back before he had satisfied the terrible craving within him

After supper the books were taken and in Gaelic for though Donald
Finch was perfectly able in English for business and ordinary affairs
of life when it came to the worship of God he found that only in the
ancient mother tongue could he get liberty As Hughie listened to the
solemn reading and then to the prayer that followed though he could
understand only a word now and again he was greatly impressed with the
rhythmic solemn cadence of the voice and as he glanced through his
fingers at the old mans face he was surprised to find how completely
it had changed It was no longer the face of the stern and stubborn
autocrat but of an earnest humble reverent man of God and Hughie
looking at him wondered if he would not be altogether nicer with
his wife and boys after that prayer was done He had yet to learn how
obstinate and even hard a man can be and still have a great gift in
prayer

From the old mans face Hughies glance wandered to his wifes and
there was held fascinated For the first time Hughie thought it was
beautiful and more than that he was startled to find that it reminded
him of his mothers At once he closed his eyes for he felt as if he
had been prying where he had no right

After the prayer was over they all drew about the glowing polished
kitchen stove with the open front and set themselves to enjoy that hour
which more than any other helps to weave into the memory the thoughts
and feelings that in after days are associated with home Old Donald
drew forth his pipe a pleased expectation upon his face and after
cutting enough tobacco from the black plug which he pulled from his
trousers pocket he rolled it fine with deliberation and packed it
carefully into his briarroot pipe from which dangled a tin cap then
drawing out some live coals from the fire he with a quick motion picked
one up set it upon the top of the tobacco and holding it there with
his bare finger until Hughie was sure he would burn himself puffed with
hard smacking puffs but with a more comfortable expression than Hughie
had yet seen him wear Then when it was fairly lit he knocked off the
coal packed down the tobacco put on the little tin cap and sat back
in his covered armchair and came as near beaming upon the world as
ever he allowed himself to come

Here Jessac he said to the little darkfaced maiden slipping about
the table under the mothers silent direction Jessac glanced at her
mother and hesitated Then apparently reading her mothers face she
said In a minute da and seizing the broom which was much taller
than herself she began to brush up the crumbs about the table with
amazing deftness This task completed and the crumbs being thrown into
the pigs barrel which stood in the woodshed just outside the door
Jessac set her broom in the corner hung up the dustpan on its proper
nail behind the stove and then running to her father climbed up
on his knee and snuggled down into his arms for an hours luxurious
laziness before the fire Hughie gazed in amazement at her temerity for
Donald Finch was not a man to take liberties with but as he gazed
he wondered the more for again the face of the stern old man was
transformed

Be quaet now lassie Hear me now I am telling you he admonished
the little girl in his arms while there flowed over his face a look of
halfshamed delight that seemed to fill up and smooth out all its severe
lines

Hughie was still gazing and wondering when the old man catching his
earnest wideopen gaze broke forth suddenly in a voice nearly jovial
Well lad so you have taken up the school again You will be having a
fine time of it altogether

The lad startled more by the joviality of his manner than by the
suddenness of his speech hastily replied Indeed we are not then

What what replied the old man returning to his normal aspect of
severity Do you not know that you have great privileges now

Huh grunted Hughie If we had Archie Munro again

And what is wrong with the new man

Oh I dont know Hes not a bit nice Hes

Too many rules said Thomas slowly

Aha said his father with a note of triumph in his tone so thats
it is it He will be bringing you to the mark I warrant you And
indeed its high time for I doubt Archie Munro was just a little soft
with you

The old mans tone was aggravating enough but his reference to the old
master was too much for Hughie and even Thomas was moved to words more
than was his wont in his fathers presence

He has too many rules repeated Thomas stolidly and they will not
be kept

And he is as proud as he can be continued Hughie Comes along with
his cane and his standup collar and lifts his hat off to the big
girls andandoch hes just as stuckup as anything Hughies
vocabulary was not equal to his contempt

There will not be much wrong with his cane in the Twentieth School I
dare say went on the old man grimly As for lifting his hat it is
time some of them were learning manners When I was a boy we were made
to mind our manners I can tell you

So are we replied Hughie hotly but we dont go shoween off like
that And then himself and his rules Hughies disgust was quite
unutterable

Rules exclaimed the old man Ay that is what is the trouble

Well said Hughie with a spice of mischief if Thomas is late for
school he will have to bring a note of excuse

Very good indeed And why should he be late at all

And if any one wants a pencil he cant ask for it unless he gets
permission from the master

Capital said the old man rubbing his hands delightedly Hes the
right sort whatever

And if you keep Thomas home a day or a week you will have to write to
the master about it continued Hughie

And what for pray said the old man hastily May I not
keepbutYes thats a very fine rule too It will keep the boys from
the woods I am thinking

But think of big Murdie Cameron holding up his hand to ask leave to
speak to Bob Fraser

And why not indeed If hes not too big to be in school hes not too
big for that Man alive you should have seen the master in my school
days lay the lads over the forms and warm their backs to them

As big as Murdie

Ay and bigger And whats more he would send for them to their homes
and bring them strapped to a wheelbarrow Yon was a master for you

Hughie snorted Huh I tell you what we wouldnt stand that And we
wont stand this man either

And what will you be doing now Hughie quizzed the old man

Well said Hughie reddening at the sarcasm I will not do much but
the big boys will just carry him out

And who will be daring to do that Hughie

Well Murdie and Bob Fraser and Curly Ross and Don andand Thomas
there added Hughie fearing to hurt Thomas feelings by leaving him
out

Ay said the old man shutting his lips tight on his pipestem and
puffing with a smacking noise let me catch Thomas at that

And I would help too said Hughie valiantly fearing he had exposed
his friend and wishing to share his danger

Well your father would be seeing to that said the old man with
great satisfaction feeling that Hughies discipline might be safely
left in the ministers hands

There was a pause of a few moments and then a quiet voice inquired
gently He will be a very big man Hughie I suppose

Oh just ordinary said Hughie innocently turning to Mrs Finch

Oh then they will not be requiring you and Thomas I am thinking to
carry him out At which Hughie and Billy Jack and Jessac laughed aloud
but Thomas and his father only looked stolidly into the fire

Come Thomas said his mother take your fiddle a bit Hughie will
like a tune There was no need of any further discussing the new
master

But Thomas was very shy about his fiddle and besides he was not in
a mood for it his fathers words had rasped him It took the united
persuasions of Billy Jack and Jessac and Hughie to get the fiddle into
Thomas hands but after a few tuning scrapes all shyness and moodiness
vanished and soon the reels and strathspeys were dropping from Thomas
flying fingers in a way that set Hughies blood tingling But when the
fiddler struck into Money Musk Billy Jack signed Jessac to him and
whispering to her set her out on the middle of the floor

Aw I dont like to said Jessac twisting her apron into her mouth

Come away Jessac said her mother quietly do your best And
Jessac laying aside shyness went at her Highland reel with the same
serious earnestness she gave to her tidying or her knitting Daintily
she tripped the twentyfour steps of that intricate ancient dance of
the Celt people whirling balancing poising snapping her fingers
and twinkling her feet in the true Highland style till once more her
fathers face smoothed out its wrinkles and beamed like a harvest moon
Hughie gazed uncertain whether to allow himself to admire Jessacs
performance or to regard it with a boys scorn as she was only a
girl And yet he could not escape the fascination of the swift rhythmic
movement of the neat twinkling feet

Well done Jessac lass said her father proudly But what would the
minister be saying at such frivolity he added glancing at Hughie

Huh he can do it himself well enough said Hughie and I tell you
what I only wish I could do it

Ill show you said Jessac shyly but for the first time in his life
Hughies courage failed and though he would have given much to be able
to make his feet twinkle through the mazes of the Highland reel he
could not bring himself to accept teaching from Jessac If it had only
been Thomas or Billy Jack who had offered he would soon enough have
been on the floor For a moment he hesitated then with a sudden
inspiration he cried All right Do it again Ill watch But the
mother said quietly I think that will do Jessac And I am afraid
your father will be going with cold hands if you dont hurry with those
mitts And Jessac put up her lip with the true girls grimace and went
away for her knitting to Hughies disappointment and relief

Soon Billy Jack took down the tin lantern pierced with holes into
curious patterns through which the candlelight rayed forth and went
out to bed the horses In spite of protests from all the family Hughie
set forth with him carrying the lantern and feeling very much the
farmer while Billy Jack took two pails of boiled oats and barley with
a mixture of flaxseed which was supposed to give to the Finchs team
their famous and superior gloss When they returned from the stable they
found in the kitchen Thomas who was rubbing a composition of tallow and
beeswax into his boots to make them waterproof and the mother who
was going about setting the table for the breakfast

Too bad you have to go to bed mother said Billy Jack struggling
with his bootjack You might just go on getting the breakfast and
what a fine start that would give you for the day

You hurry William John to bed with that poor lad What would his
mother say He must be fairly exhausted

Im not a bit tired said Hughie brightly his face radiant with the
delight of his new experiences

You will need all your sleep my boy said the mother kindly for
we rise early here But she added you will lie till the boys are
through with their work and Thomas will waken you for your breakfast

Indeed no Im going to get up announced Hughie

But Hughie said Billy Jack seriously if you and Thomas are going
to carry out that man tomorrow you will need a mighty lot of sleep
tonight

Hush William John said the mother to her eldest son you mustnt
tease Hughie And its not good to be saying such things even in fun
to boys like Thomas and Hughie

Thats true mother for theyre rather fierce already

Indeed they are not that And I am sure they will do nothing that will
shame their parents

To this Hughie made no reply It was no easy matter to harmonize the
thought of his parents with the exploit of ejecting the master from the
school so he only said good night and went off with the silent Thomas
to bed But in the visions of his head which haunted him the night long
racing horses and little girls with tossing curls and twinkling feet
were strangely mingled with wild conflicts with the new master and it
seemed to him that he had hardly dropped off to sleep when he was
awake again to see Thomas standing beside him with a candle in his hand
announcing that breakfast was ready

Have you been out to the stable he eagerly inquired and Thomas
nodded In great disappointment and a little shamefacedly he made his
appearance at the breakfasttable

It seemed to Hughie as if it must be still the night before for it was
quite dark outside He had never had breakfast by candlelight before
in his life and he felt as if it all were still a part of his dreams
until he found himself sitting beside Billy Jack on a load of sawlogs
waving good by to the group at the door the old man whose face in the
gray morning light had resumed its wonted severe look the quiet little
darkfaced woman smiling kindly at him and bidding him come again and
the little maid at her side with the dark ringlets who glanced at him
from behind the shelter of her mothers skirts with shy boldness

As Hughie was saying his good bys he was thinking most of the twinkling
feet and the tossing curls and so he added to his farewells Good
by Jessac Im going to learn that reel from you some day and then
turning about he straightway forgot all about her and her reel for
Billy Jacks horses were pawing to be off and rolling their solemn
bells while their breath rose in white clouds above their heads
wreathing their manes in hoary rime

Gitep lads said Billy Jack hauling his lines taut and flourishing
his whip The bays straightened their backs hung for a few moments
on their tugs for the load had frozen fast during the night and then
moved off at a smart trot the bells solemnly booming out and the
sleighs creaking over the frosty snow

Man said Hughie enthusiastically I wish I could draw logs all
winter

Its not too bad a job on a day like this assented Billy Jack And
indeed any one might envy him the work on such a morning Over the
treetops the rays of the sun were beginning to shoot their rosy darts
up into the sky and to flood the clearing with light that sparkled and
shimmered upon the frost particles glittering upon and glorifying snow
and trees and even the stumps and fences Around the clearing stood the
forest dark and still except for the frost reports that now and then
rang out like pistol shots To Hughie the early morning invested the
forest with a new beauty and a new wonder The dim light of the dawning
day deepened the silence so that involuntarily he hushed his voice in
speaking and the deeptoned roll of the sleighbells seemed to smite
upon that dim solemn quiet with startling blows On either side
the balsams and spruces with their mantles of snow stood like
whiteswathed sentinels on guardsilent motionless alert Hughie
looked to see them move as the team drove past

As they left the more open butternut ridge and descended into the depths
of the big pine swamp the dim light faded into deeper gloom and Hughie
felt as if he were in church and an awe gathered upon him

Its awful still he said to Billy Jack in a low tone and Billy Jack
catching the look in the boys face checked the light word upon his
lips and gazed around into the deep forest glooms with new eyes The
mystery and wonder of the forest had never struck him before It had
hitherto been to him a place for hunting or for getting big sawlogs
But today he saw it with Hughies eyes and felt the majesty of its
beauty and silence For a long time they drove without a word

Say its mighty fine isnt it he said adopting Hughies low tone

Splendid exclaimed Hughie My I could just hug those big trees
They look at me likelike your mother dont they or mine But this
was beyond Billy Jack

Like my mother

Yes you know quiet andandkind and nice

Yes said Thomas breaking in for the first time thats just it
They do look sure enough like my mother and yours They have both got
that look

Gitep said Billy Jack to his team These fellowsll be ketchin
something bad if we dont get into the open soon Shouldnt wonder if
theyve got em already making out their mothers like an old white
pine Gitep I say

Oh pshaw said Hughie you know what I mean

Not much I dont But it dont matter so long as youre feelin all
right This swamps rather bad for the groojums

What Hughies eyes began to open wide as he glanced into the forest

The groojums Never heard of them things They ketch a fellow in places
like this when its gettin on towards midnight and about daylight its
almost as bad

What are they like asked Hughie upon whom the spell of the forest
lay

Oh mighty queer Always crawl up on your back and ye cant help
twistin round

Hughie glanced at Thomas and was at once relieved

Oh pshaw Billy Jack you cant fool me I know you

I guess youre safe enough now They dont bother you much in the
clearing said Billy Jack encouragingly

Oh fiddle Im not afraid

Nobody is in the open and especially in the daytime

Oh I dont care for your old groojums

Guess you care more for your new boss yonder eh said Billy Jack
nodding toward the schoolhouse which now came into view

Oh said Hughie with a groan I just hate going today

Youll be all right when you get there said Billy Jack cheerfully
Its like goin in swimmin

Soon they were at the crossroads

Good by Billy Jack said Hughie feeling as if he had been on a long
long visit Ive had an awfully good time and Id like to go back with
you

Wish you would said Billy Jack heartily Come again soon And dont
carry out the master today It looks like a storm he might get cold

He had better mind out then cried Hughie after Billy Jack and set
off with Thomas for the school But neither Hughie nor Thomas had any
idea of the thrilling experiences awaiting them in the Twentieth School
before the week was done



CHAPTER V

THE CRISIS


The first days of that week were days of strife Murdie Cameron and
Bob Fraser and the other big boys succeeded in keeping in line with the
masters rules and regulations They were careful never to be late
and so saved themselves the degradation of bringing an excuse But the
smaller boys set themselves to make the masters life a burden and
succeeded beyond their highest expectations for the master was quick
of temper and was determined at all costs to exact full and prompt
obedience There was more flogging done those first six days than during
any six months of Archie Munros rule Sometimes the floggings amounted
to little but sometimes they were serious and when those fell upon the
smaller boys the girls would weep and the bigger boys would grind their
teeth and swear

The situation became so acute that Murdie Cameron and the big boys
decided that they would quit the school They were afraid the temptation
to throw the master out would some day be more than they could bear
and for men who had played their part not without credit in the Scotch
River fights to carry out the master would have been an exploit hardly
worthy of them So in dignified contempt of the master and his rules
they left the school after the third day

Their absence did not help matters much indeed the master appeared to
be relieved and proceeded to tame the school into submission It was
little Jimmie Cameron who precipitated the crisis Jimmies nose upon
which he relied when struggling with his snickers had an unpleasant
trick of failing him at critical moments and of letting out explosive
snorts of the most disturbing kind He had finally been warned that upon
his next outburst punishment would fall

It was Friday afternoon the drowsy hour just before recess while the
master was explaining to the listless Euclid class the mysteries of the
fortyseventh proposition that suddenly a snort of unusual violence
burst upon the school Immediately every eye was upon the master for
all had heard and had noted his threat to Jimmie

James was that you sir

There was no answer except such as could be gathered from Jimmies very
red and very shamed face

James stand up

Jimmie wriggled to his feet and stood a heap of various angles

Now James you remember what I promised you Come here sir

Jimmie came slowly to the front growing paler at each step and stood
with a dazed look on his face before the master He had never been
thrashed in all his life At home the big brothers might cuff him
goodnaturedly or his mother thump him on the head with her thimble
but a serious whipping was to him an unknown horror

The master drew forth his heavy black strap with impressive deliberation
and ominous silence The preparations for punishment were so elaborate
and imposing that the big boys guessed that the punishment itself would
not amount to much Not so Jimmie He stood numb with fear and horrible
expectation The master lifted up the strap

James hold out your hand

Jimmie promptly clutched his hand behind his back

Hold out your hand sir at once No answer

James you must do as you are told Your punishment for disobedience
will be much severer than for laughing But Jimmie stood pale silent
with his hands tight clasped behind his back

The master stepped forward and grasping the little boys arm tried to
pull his hand to the front but Jimmie with a roar like that of a young
bull threw himself flat on his face on the floor and put his hands
under him The school burst into a laugh of triumph which increased the
masters embarrassment and rage

Silence he said or it will be a worse matter for some of you than
for James

Then turning his attention to Jimmie be lifted him from the floor and
tried to pull out his hand But Jimmie kept his arms folded tight across
his breast roaring vigorously the while and saying over and over Go
away from me Go away from me I tell you Im not taking anything to do
with you

The big boys were enjoying the thing immensely The masters rage was
deepening in proportion He felt it would never do to be beaten His
whole authority was at stake

Now James he reasoned you see you are only making it worse for
yourself I cannot allow any disobedience in the school You must hold
out your hand

But Jimmie realizing that he had come off best in the first round
stood doggedly sniffing his arms still folded tight

Now James I shall give you one more chance Hold out your hand

Jimmie remained like a statue

Whack came the heavy strap over his shoulders At once Jimmie set up
his refrain Go away from me I tell you Im not taking anything to do
with you

Whack whack whack fell the strap with successive blows each heavier
than the last There was no longer any laughing in the school The
affair was growing serious The girls were beginning to sob and the
bigger boys to grow pale

Now James will you hold out your hand You see how much worse you are
making it for yourself said the master who was heartily sick of the
struggle which he felt to be undignified and the result of which he
feared was dubious

But Jimmie only kept up his cry now punctuated with sobs
Imnottakinganythingto dowithyou

Jimmie listen to me said the master You must hold out your hand I
cannot have boys refusing to obey me in this school But Jimmie caught
the entreaty in the tone and knowing that the battle was nearly over
kept obstinately silent

Well then said the master suddenly you must take it and lifting
the strap he laid it with such sharp emphasis over Jimmies shoulders
that Jimmies voice rose in a wilder roar than usual and the girls
burst into audible weeping

Suddenly above all the hubbub rose a voice clear and sharp

Stop It was Thomas Finch of all people standing with face white and
tense and regarding the master with steady eyes

The school gazed thunderstruck at the usually slow and stolid Thomas

What do you mean sir said the master gladly turning from Jimmie
But Thomas stood silent as much surprised as the master at his sudden
exclamation

He stood hesitating for a moment and then said You can thrash me in
his place Hes a little chap and has never been thrashed

The master misunderstood his hesitation for fear pushed Jimmie aside
threw down his strap and seized a birch rod

Come forward sir Ill put an end to your insubordination at any
rate Hold out your hand

Thomas held out his hand till the master finished one birch rod

The other hand sir

Another birch rod was used up but Thomas neither uttered a sound nor
made a move till the master had done then he asked in a strained
voice Were you going to give Jimmie all that sir

The master caught the biting sneer in the tone and lost himself
completely

Do you dare to answer me back he cried He opened his desk took out
a rawhide and without waiting to ask for his hand began to lay the
rawhide about Thomass shoulders and legs till he was out of breath

Now perhaps you will learn your place sir he said

Thank you said Thomas looking him steadily in the eye

You are welcome And Ill give you as much more whenever you show that
you need it The slight laugh with which he closed this brutal speech
made Thomas wince as he had not during his whole terrible thrashing but
still he had not a word to say

Now James come here said the master turning to Jimmie You see
what happens when a boy is insubordinate Jimmie came trembling Hold
out your hand Out came Jimmies hand at once Whack fell the strap

The other

Stop it roared Thomas I took his thrashing

The other said the master ignoring Thomas

With a curious savage snarl Thomas sprung at him The master however
was on the alert and swinging round met him with a straight facer
between the eyes and Thomas went to the floor

Aha my boy Ill teach you something you have yet to learn

For answer came another cry Come on boys It was Ranald Macdonald
coming over the seats followed by Don Cameron Billy Ross and some
smaller boys The master turned to meet them

Come along he said backing up to his desk But I warn you its not
a strap or a rawhide I shall use

Ranald paid no attention to his words but came straight toward him and
when at arms length sprung at him with the cry Horo boys

But before he could lay his hands upon the master he received a blow
straight on the bridge of the nose that staggered him back stunned and
bleeding By this time Thomas was up again and rushing in was received
in like manner and fell back over a bench

How do you like it boys smiled the master Come right along

The boys obeyed his invitation approaching him but more warily and
awaiting their chance to rush Suddenly Thomas with a savage snarl
put his head down and rushed in beneath the masters guard paid no
attention to the heavy blow he received on the head and locking his
arms round the masters middle buried his head close into his chest

At once Ranald and Billy Ross threw themselves upon the struggling pair
and carried them to the floor the master underneath There was a few
moments of fierce struggling and then the master lay still with the
four boys holding him down for dear life

It was Thomas who assumed command

Dont choke him so Ranald he said And clear out of the way all
you girls and little chaps

What are you going to do Thomas asked Don acknowledging Thomass
newborn leadership

Tie him up said Thomas Get me a sash

At once two or three little boys rushed to the hooks and brought one or
two of the knitted sashes that hung there and Thomas proceeded to tie
the masters legs

While he was thus busily engaged a shadow darkened the door and a
voice exclaimed What is all this about It was the minister who
had been driving past and had come upon the terrified weeping children
rushing home

Is that you Thomas And you Don

The boys let go their hold and stood up shamed but defiant

Immediately the master was on his feet and with a swift fierce blow
caught Thomas on the chin Thomas taken off his guard fell with a thud
on the floor

Stop that young man said the minister catching his arm Thats a
cowards blow

Hands off said the master shaking himself free and squaring up to
him

Ye would would ye said the minister gripping him by the neck and
shaking him as he might a child Lift yere hand to me would ye
Ill break youre back to ye and that I will So saying the minister
seized him by the arms and held him absolutely helpless The master
ceased to struggle and put down his hands

Ay yed better my man said the minister giving him a fling
backward

Meantime Don had been holding snow to Thomass head and had brought him
round

Now then said the minister to the boys what does all this mean

The boys were all silent but the master spoke

It is a case of rank and impudent insubordination sir and I demand
the expulsion of those impudent rascals

Well sir said the minister be sure there will be a thorough
investigation and I greatly misjudge the case if there are not faults
on both sides And for one thing the man who can strike such a cowardly
blow as you did a moment ago would not be unlikely to be guilty of
injustice and cruelty

It is none of your business said the master insolently

You will find that I shall make it my business said the minister
And now boys be off to your homes and be here Monday morning at nine
oclock when this matter shall be gone into



CHAPTER VI

ONE THAT RULETH WELL HIS OWN HOUSE


The news of the school trouble ran through the section like fire through
a brule The younger generations when they heard how Thomas Finch had
dared the master raised him at once to the rank of hero but the heads
of families received the news doubtfully and wondered what the rising
generation was coming to

The next day Billy Jack heard the story in the Twentieth store and with
some anxiety waited for the news to reach his fathers ears for to tell
the truth Billy Jack man though he was held his father in dread

How did you come to do it he asked Thomas Why didnt you let Don
begin It was surely Dons business

I dont know It slipped out replied Thomas I couldnt stand
Jimmies yelling any longer I didnt know I said anything till I found
myself standing up and after that I didnt seem to care for anything

Man it was fine though said Billy Jack I didnt think it was in
you And Thomas felt more than repaid for all his cruel beating It was
something to win the approval of Billy Jack in an affair of this kind

It was at church on the Sabbath day that Donald Finch heard about his
sons doings in the school the week before The minister in his sermon
thought fit to dwell upon the tendency of the rising generation to
revolt against authority in all things and solemnly laid upon parents
the duty and responsibility of seeing to it that they ruled their
households well

It was not just the advice that Donald Finch stood specially in need of
but he was highly pleased with the sermon and was enlarging upon it
in the churchyard where the people gathered between the services when
Peter McRae thinking that old Donald was hardly taking the ministers
advice to himself as he ought and not knowing that the old man was
ignorant of all that had happened in the school answered him somewhat
severely

It is good to be approving the sermon but I would rather be seeing you
make a practical application of it

Indeed that is true replied Donald and it would not be amiss for
more than me to make application of it

Indeed then if all reports be true replied Peter it would be well
for you to begin at home

Mr McRae said Donald earnestly it is myself that knows well
enough my shortcomings but if there is any special reason for your
remark I am not aware of it

This light treatment of what to Peter had seemed a grievous offense
against all authority incensed the old dominie beyond all endurance

And do you not think that the conduct of your son last week calls for
any reproof And is it you that will stand up and defend it in the face
of the minister and his sermon upon it this day

Donald gazed at him a few moments as if he had gone mad At length he
replied slowly I do not wish to forget that you are an elder of the
church Mr McRae and I will not be charging you with telling lies on
me and my family

Tut tut man broke in Long John Cameron seeing how the matter
stood hes just referring to yon little difference Thomas had with the
master last week But its just nothing Come away in

Thomas gasped Donald My Thomas

You have not heard then said Peter in surprise and old Donald only
shook his head

Then its time you did replied Peter severely for such things are
a disgrace to the community

Nonsense said Long John Not a bit of it I think none the less of
Thomas for it But in matters of this kind Long John could hardly be
counted an authority for it was not so very long ago since he had been
beguiled into an affair at the Scotch River which while it brought
him laurels at the hands of the younger generation did not add to his
reputation with the elders of the church

It did not help matters much that Murdie Cameron and others of his set
proceeded to congratulate old Donald in their own way upon his sons
achievement and with all the more fervor that they perceived that it
moved the solemn Peter to righteous wrath From one and another the tale
came forth with embellishments till Donald Finch was reduced to such a
state of voiceless rage and humiliation that when at the sound of the
opening psalm the congregation moved into the church for the Gaelic
service the old man departed for his home trembling silent amazed

How Thomas could have brought this disgrace upon him he could not
imagine If it had been William John who with all his good nature had
a temper brittle enough he would not have been surprised And then the
ministers sermon of which he had spoken in such open and enthusiastic
approval how it condemned him for his neglect of duty toward his
family and held up his authority over his household to scorn It was a
terrible blow to his pride

It is the Lords judgment upon me he said to himself as he tramped
his way through the woods It is the curse of Eli that is hanging over
me and mine And with many vows he resolved that at all costs he
would do his duty in this crisis and bring Thomas to a sense of his
sins

It was in this spirit that he met his family at the suppertable after
their return from the Gaelic service

What is this I hear about you Thomas he began as Thomas came in and
took his place at the table What is this I hear about you sir he
repeated making a great effort to maintain a calm and judicial tone

Thomas remained silent partly because he usually found speech
difficult but chiefly because he dreaded his fathers wrath

What is this that has become the talk of the countryside and the
disgrace of my name continued the father in deepening tones

No very great disgrace surely said Billy Jack lightly hoping to
turn his fathers anger

Be you silent sir commanded the old man sternly I will ask for
your opinion when I require it You and others beside you in this house
need to learn your places

Billy Jack made no reply fearing to make matters worse though he found
it hard not to resent this taunt which he knew well was flung at his
mother

I wonder at you Thomas after such a sermon as yon I wonder you are
able to sit there unconcerned at this table I wonder you are not hiding
your head in shame and confusion The old man was lashing himself into
a white rage while Thomas sat looking stolidly before him his slow
tongue finding no words of defense And indeed he had little thought of
defending himself He was conscious of an acute selfcondemnation and
yet struggling through his slowmoving mind there was a feeling that in
some sense he could not define there was justification for what he had
done

It is not often that Thomas has grieved you ventured the mother
timidly for with all her courage she feared her husband when he was
in this mood

Woman be silent blazed forth the old man as if he had been waiting
for her words It is not for you to excuse his wickedness You are too
fond of that work and your children are reaping the fruits of it

Billy Jack looked up quickly as if to answer but his mother turned her
face full upon him and commanded him with steady eyes giving herself
no sign of emotion except for a slight tightening of the lips and a
touch of color in her face

Your children have well learned their lesson of rebellion and deceit
continued her husband allowing his passion a free rein But I vow unto
the Lord I will put an end to it now whatever And I will give you
to remember sir turning to Thomas to the end of your days this
occasion And now hence from this table Let me not see your face till
the Sabbath is past and then if the Lord spares me I shall deal with
you

Thomas hesitated a moment as if he had not quite taken in his fathers
words then leaving his supper untouched he rose slowly and without
a word climbed the ladder to the loft The mother followed him a moment
with her eyes and then once more turning to Billy Jack held him with
calm steady gaze Her immediate fear was for her eldest son Thomas
she knew would in the mean time simply suffer what might be his lot
but for many a day she had lived in terror of an outbreak between
her eldest son and her husband Again Billy Jack caught her look and
commanded himself to silence

The fire is low William John she said in a quiet voice Billy Jack
rose and from the woodbox behind the stove replenished the fire
reading perfectly his mothers mind and resolving at all costs to do
her will

At the taking of the books that night the prayer which was spoken in a
tone of awful and almost inaudible solemnity was for the most part an
exaltation of the majesty and righteousness of the government of God
and a lamentation over the wickedness and rebellion of mankind And
Billy Jack thought it was no good augury that it closed with a petition
for grace to maintain the honor of that government and to uphold that
righteous majesty in all the relations of life It was a woeful evening
to them all and as soon as possible the household went miserably to
bed

Before going to her room the mother slipped up quietly to the loft and
found Thomas lying in his bunk dressed and awake He was still puzzling
out his ethical problem His conscience clearly condemned him for his
fight with the master and yet somehow he could not regret having stood
up for Jimmie and taken his punishment He expected no mercy at his
fathers hands next morning The punishment he knew would be cruel
enough but it was not the pain that Thomas was dreading he was dimly
struggling with the sense of outrage for ever since the moment he had
stood up and uttered his challenge to the master he had felt himself to
be different That moment now seemed to belong to the distant years
when he was a boy and now he could not imagine himself submitting to
a flogging from any man and it seemed to him strange and almost
impossible that even his father should lift his hand to him

You are not sleeping Thomas said his mother going up to his bunk

No mother

And you have had no supper at all

I dont want any mother

The mother sat silent beside him for a time and then said quietly
You did not tell me Thomas

No mother I didnt like

It would have been better that your father should have heard this
fromI mean should have heard it at home Andyou might have told me
Thomas

Yes mother I wish now I had But indeed I cant understand how it
happened I dont feel as if it was me at all And then Thomas told his
mother all the tale finishing his story with the words And I couldnt
help it mother at all

The mother remained silent for a little and then with a little tremor
in her voice she replied No Thomas I know you couldnt help it and
I here her voice quite brokeI am not ashamed of you

Are you not mother said Thomas sitting up suddenly in great
surprise Then I dont care I couldnt make it out well

Never you mind Thomas it will be well and she leaned over him and
kissed him Thomas felt her face wet with tears and his stolid reserve
broke down

Oh mother mother I dont care now he cried his breath coming in
great sobs I dont care at all And he put his arms round his mother
clinging to her as if he had been a child

I know laddie I know whispered his mother Never you fear never
fear And then as if to herself she added Thank the Lord you are
not a coward whatever

Thomas found himself again without words but he held his mother fast
his big body shaking with his sobs

And Thomas she continued after a pause your fatherwe must just
be patient All her life long this had been her struggle Andandhe
is a good man Her tears were now flowing fast and her voice had quite
lost its calm

Thomas was alarmed and distressed He had never in all his life seen his
mother weep and rarely had heard her voice break

Dont mother he said growing suddenly quiet himself Dont you
mind mother Itll be all right and Im not afraid

Yes she said rising and regaining her selfcontrol it will be all
right Thomas You go to sleep And there were such evident reserves of
strength behind her voice that Thomas lay down certain that all would
be well His mother had never failed him

The mother went downstairs with the purpose in her heart of having a
talk with her husband but Donald Finch knew her ways well and had
resolved that he would have no speech with her upon the matter for he
knew that it would be impossible for him to persevere in his intention
to deal with Thomas if he allowed his wife to have any talk with him

The morning brought the mother no opportunity of speech with her
husband He contrary to his custom remained until breakfast in his
room Outside in the kitchen he could hear Billy Jacks cheerful tones
and hearty laugh and it angered him to think that his displeasure
should have so little effect upon his household If the house had
remained shrouded in gloom and the family had gone about on tiptoes
and with bated breath it would have shown no more than a proper
appreciation of the fathers displeasure but as Billy Jacks cheerful
words and laughter fell upon his ear he renewed his vows to do his duty
that day in upholding his authority and bringing to his son a due sense
of his sin

In grim silence he ate his breakfast except for a sharp rebuke to
Billy Jack who had been laboring throughout the meal to make cheerful
conversation with Jessac and his mother At his fathers rebuke Billy
Jack dropped his cheerful tone and avoiding his mothers eyes he
assumed at once an attitude of open defiance his tones and words
plainly offering to his father war if war he would have

You will come to me in the room after breakfast said his father as
Thomas rose to go to the stable

Theres a meeting of the trustees at nine oclock at the schoolhouse
at which Thomas must be present interposed Billy Jack in firm steady
tones

He may go when I have done with him said his father angrily and
meantime you will attend to your own business

Yes sir I will that Billy Jacks response came back with fierce
promptness

The old man glanced at him caught the light in his eyes hesitated a
moment and then throwing all restraint to the winds thundered out
What do you mean sir

What I say I am going to attend to my own business and that soon
Billy Jacks tone was quick eager defiant

Again the old man hesitated and then replied Go to it then

I am going and I am going to take Thomas to that meeting at nine
oclock

I did not know that you had business there said the old man
sarcastically

Then you may know it now blazed forth Billy Jack for I am going
And as sure as I stand here I will see that Thomas gets fair play there
if he doesnt at home if I have to lick every trustee in the section

Hold your peace sir said his father coming nearer him Do not give
me any impertinence and do not accuse me of unfairness

Have you heard Thomass side of the story returned Billy Jack

I have heard enough and more than enough

You havent heard both sides

I know the truth of it whatever the shameful and disgraceful truth of
it I know that the countryside is ringing with it I know that in the
house of God the minister held up my family to the scorn of the people
And I vowed to do my duty to my house

The old mans passion had risen to such a height that for a moment
Billy Jack quailed before it In the pause that followed the old mans
outburst the mother came to her son

Hush William John You are not to forget yourself nor your duty to
your father and to me Thomas will receive full justice in this matter
There was a quiet strength and dignity in her manner that commanded
immediate attention from both men

The mother went on in a low even voice Your father has his duty to
perform and you must not take upon yourself to interfere

Billy Jack could hardly believe his ears That his mother should desert
him and should support what he knew she felt to be injustice and
tyranny was more than he could understand No less perplexed was her
husband

As they stood there looking at each other uncertain as to the next
step there came a knock at the back door The mother went to open it
pausing on her way to push back some chairs and put the room to rights
thus allowing the family to regain its composure

Good morning Mrs Finch You will be thinking I have slept in your
barn all night It was Long John Cameron

Come away in Mr Cameron It is never too early for friends to come to
this house said Mrs Finch her voice showing her great relief

Long John came in glanced shrewdly about and greeted Mr Finch with
great heartiness

Its a fine winter day Mr Finch but it looks as if we might have a
storm You are busy with the logs I hear

Old Donald was slowly recovering himself

And a fine lot you are having continued Long John I was just saying
the other day that it was wonderful the work you could get through

Indeed it is hard enough to do anything here said Donald Finch with
some bitterness

You may say so responded Long John cheerfully The snow is that
deep in the bush and

You were wanting to see me Mr Cameron interrupted Donald I have a
business on hand which requires attention

Indeed and so have I For it is

And indeed it is just as well you and all should know it for my
disgrace is well known

Disgrace exclaimed Long John

Ay disgrace For is it not a disgrace to have the conduct of your
family become the occasion of a sermon on the Lords Day

Indeed I did not think much of yon sermon whatever replied Long
John

I cannot agree with you Mr Cameron It was a powerful sermon and it
was only too sorely needed But I hope it will not be without profit to
myself

Indeed it is not the sermon you have much need of said Long John
for every one knows what a

Ay it is myself that needs it but with the help of the Lord I will be
doing my duty this morning

And I am very glad to hear that replied Long John for that is why I
am come

And what may you have to do with it asked the old man

As to that indeed replied Long John coolly I am not yet quite
sure But if I might ask without being too bold what is the particular
duty to which you are referring

You may ask and you and all have a right to know for I am about to
visit upon my son his sins and shame

And is it meaning to wheep him you are

Ay said the old man and his lips came fiercely together

Indeed then you will just do no such thing this morning

And by what right do you interfere in my domestic affairs demanded
old Donald with dignity Answer me that Mr Cameron

Right or no right replied Long John before any man lays a finger on
Thomas there he will need to begin with myself And he added grimly
there are not many in the county who would care for that job

Old Donald Finch looked at his visitor in speechless amazement At
length Long John grew excited

Man alive he exclaimed its a quare father you are You may be
thinking it disgrace but the section will be proud that there is a boy
in it brave enough to stand up for the weak against a brute bully And
then he proceeded to tell the tale as he had heard it from Don with
such strong passion and such rude vigor that in spite of himself old
Donald found his rage vanish and his heart began to move within him
toward his son

And it is for that cried Long John dashing his fist into his open
palm it is for that that you would punish your son May God forgive
me but the man that lays a finger on Thomas yonder will come into sore
grief this day Ay lad continued Long John striding toward Thomas
and gripping him by the shoulders with both hands you are a man and
you stood up for the weak yon day and if you efer will be wanting a
friend remember John Cameron

Well well Mr Cameron said old Donald who was more deeply moved
than he cared to show it maybe as you say It maybe the lad was not so
much in the wrong

In the wrong roared Long John blowing his nose hard In the wrong
May my boys ever be in the wrong in such a way

Well said old Donald we shall see about this And if Thomas has
suffered injustice it is not his father will refuse to see him righted
And soon they were all off to the meeting at the schoolhouse

Thomas was the last to leave the room As usual he had not been able
to find a word but stood white and trembling but as he found himself
alone with his mother once more his stolid reserve broke down and he
burst into a strange and broken cry Oh mother mother but he could
get no further

Never mind laddie said his mother you have borne yourself well
and your mother is proud of you

At the investigation held in the schoolhouse it became clear that
though the insubordination of both Jimmie and Thomas was undeniable the
provocation by the master had been very great And though the minister
who was superintendent of instruction for the district insisted that
the masters authority must at all costs be upheld such was the rage
of old Donald Finch and Long John Cameron that the upshot was that the
master took his departure from the section glad enough to escape with
bones unbroken



CHAPTER VII

FOXY


After the expulsion of the master the Twentieth School fell upon evil
days for the trustees decided that it would be better to try gurl
teachers as Hughie contemptuously called them and this policy
prevailed for two or three years with the result that the big boys left
the school and with their departure the old heroic age passed away to
be succeeded by an age soft lawabiding and distinctly commercial

The spirit of this unheroic age was incarnate in the person of Foxy
Ross Foxy got his name in the first instance from the peculiar pinky
red shade of hair that crowned his white fat face but the name stuck
to him as appropriately descriptive of his tricks and his manners His
face was large and smooth and fat with wide mouth and teeth that
glistened when he smiled His smile was like his face large and
smooth and fat His eyes which were light graywhite Hughie called
themwere shifty avoiding the gaze that sought to read them or
piercingly keen according as he might choose

After the departure of the big boys Foxy gradually grew in influence
until his only rival in the school was Hughie Foxys father was the
storekeeper in the Twentieth and this brought within Foxys reach
possibilities of influence that gave him an immense advantage over
Hughie By means of bullseyes and lickerish sticks Foxy could win
the allegiance of all the smaller boys and many of the bigger ones
while with the girls both big and small his willingness to please
and his smooth manners won from many affection and from the rest
toleration although Betsy Dan Campbell asserted that whenever Foxy Ross
came near her she felt something creeping up her backbone

With the teacher too Foxy was a great favorite He gave her worshipful
reverence and many gifts from his fathers store eloquent of his
devotion He was never detected in mischief and was always ready to
expose the misdemeanors of the other boys Thus it came that Foxy was
the paramount influence within the school

Outside his only rival was Hughie and at times Hughies rivalry became
dangerous In all games that called for skill activity and reckless
daring Hughie was easily leader In Old Sow Prisoners Base
but especially in the ancient and noble game of Shinny Hughie shone
peerless and supreme Foxy hated games and shinny the joy of those
giants of old who had torn victory from the Sixteenth and even from
the Front one glorious year was at once Foxys disgust and terror As
a little boy he could not for the life of him avoid turning his back to
wait shuddering with humping shoulders for the enemys charge and in
anything like a melee he could not help jumping into the air at every
dangerous stroke

And thus he brought upon himself the contempt even of boys much smaller
than himself who under the splendid and heroic example of those who
led them had only one ambition to get a whack at the ball and
this ambition they gratified on every possible occasion reckless of
consequences Hence when the last of the big boys Thomas Finch
against whose solid mass hosts had flung themselves to destruction
finally left the school Foxy with great skill managed to divert the
energies of the boys to games less violent and dangerous and by means
of his bullseyes and his liquorice and his large fat smile he drew
after him a very considerable following of both girls and boys

The most interesting and most successful of Foxys schemes was the game
of store which he introduced Foxy himself being the storekeeper He
had the traders genius for discovering and catering to the weaknesses
of people and hence his store became for certain days of the week
the center of life during the recreation hours The store itself was a
somewhat pretentious successor to the little brush cabin with wide open
front where in the old days the boys used to gather and lying upon
piles of fragrant balsam boughs before the big blazing fire placed in
front used to listen to the master talk and occasionally read

Foxys store was built of slabs covered with thick brush and set off
with a plank counter and shelves whereon were displayed his wares
His stock was never too large for his personal transportation but its
variety was almost infinite bullseyes and liquorice maple sugar
and other sweeties were staples Then too there were balls of gum
beautifully clear which in its raw state Foxy gathered from the ends
of the pine logs at the sawmill and which by a process of boiling and
clarifying known only to himself he brought to a marvelous perfection

But Foxys genius did not confine itself to sweets He would buy and
sell and swap anything but in swapping no bargain was ever completed
unless there was money for Foxy in the deal He had goods secondhand
and new fishhooks and marbles potmetal knives with brass handles
slatepencils that would break square which were greatly desired by
all skatestraps and buckskin whangs

But Foxys financial ability never displayed itself with more brilliancy
than when he organized the various games of the school so as to have
them begin and end with the store When the river and pond were covered
with clear black ice skating would be the rage and then Foxys store
would be hung with skatestraps and with cedarbark torches which
were greatly in demand for the skating parties that thronged the pond
at night There were no torches like Foxys The dry cedar bark any one
could get from the fences but Foxys torches were always well soaked
in oil and bound with wire and were prepared with such excellent skill
that they always burned brighter and held together longer than any
others These cedarbark torches Foxy disposed of to the larger boys
who came down to the pond at night Foxys methods of finance were
undoubtedly marked by ability and inasmuch as his accounts were never
audited the profits were large and sure He made it a point to purchase
a certain proportion of his supplies from his father who was proud of
his sons financial ability but whether his purchases always equaled
his sales no one ever knew

If the pond and river were covered with snow then Foxy would organize
a deerhunt when all the old pistols in the section would be brought
forth and the store would display a supply of gun caps by the
explosion of which deadly ammunition the deer would be dropped in their
tracks and drawn to the store by prancing steeds whose trappings had
been purchased from Foxy

When the interest in the deerhunt began to show signs of waning Foxy
would bring forth a supply of gunpowder for the purchase of which
any boy who owned a pistol would be ready to bankrupt himself In
this Hughie took a leading part although he had to depend upon the
generosity of others for the thrilling excitement of bringing down his
deer with a pistolshot for Hughie had never been able to save coppers
enough to purchase a pistol of his own

But deerhunting with pistols was forbidden by the teacher from the day
when Hughie in his eagerness to bring his quarry down left his ramrod
in his pistol and firing at Aleck Dan Campbell at pointblank range
laid him low with a lump on the side of his head as big as a marble The
only thing that saved Alecks life the teacher declared was his
thick crop of black hair Foxy was in great wrath at Hughie for his
recklessness which laid the deerhunting under the teachers ban and
which interfered seriously with the profits of the store

But Foxy was far too great a man to allow himself to be checked by any
such misfortune as this He was far too astute to attempt to defy the
teacher and carry on the forbidden game but with great ability he
adapted the principles of deerhunting to a game even more exciting and
profitable He organized the game of Injuns some of the boys being
set apart as settlers who were to defend the fort of which the store
was the center the rest to constitute the invading force of savages

The result was that the trade in caps and gunpowder was brisker than
ever for not only was the powder needed for the pistols but even
larger quantities were necessary for the slowmatches which hissed their
wrath at the approaching enemy and the mounted guns for which earthen
inkbottles did excellently set out on a big stump to explode to the
destruction of scores of creeping redskins advancing through the bush
who after being mutilated and mangled by these terrible explosions
were dragged into the camp and scalped Foxys success was phenomenal
The few pennies and fewer halfdimes and dimes that the boys had hoarded
for many long weeks would soon have been exhausted had Hughie not
wrecked the game

Hughie alone had no fear of Foxy but despised him utterly He had stood
and yelled when those heroes of old Murdie and Don Cameron Curly Ross
and Ranald Macdonald and last but not to be despised Thomas Finch had
done battle with the enemy from the Sixteenth or the Front and he could
not bring himself to acknowledge the leadership of Foxy Ross for
all his bullseyes and liquorice Not but what Hughie yearned for
bullseyes and liquorice with great yearning but these could not atone
to him for the loss out of his life of the stir and rush and daring of
the old fighting days And it galled him that the boys of the Sixteenth
could flout the boys of the Twentieth in all places and on all occasions
with impunity

But above all it seemed to him a standing disgrace that the habitant
teamsters from the north who in former days found it a necessary and
wise precaution to put their horses to a gallop as they passed the
school in order to escape with sleighs intact from the hordes that
lined the roadway now drove slowly past the very gate without an
apparent tremor But besides all this he had an instinctive shrinking
from Foxy and sympathized with Betsy Dan in her creepy feeling whenever
he approached Hence he refused allegiance and drew upon himself Foxys
jealous hatred

It was one of Foxys few errors in judgment that from his desire to
humiliate Hughie and to bring him to a proper state of subjection
he succeeded in shutting him out from the leadership in the game
of Injuns for Hughie promptly refused a subordinate position and
withdrew like Achilles to his tent But unlike Achilles though he
sulked he sulked actively and to some purpose for drawing off with
him his two faithful henchmen Fusieneither Hughie nor any one else
ever knew another name for the little French boy who had drifted into
the settlement and made his home with the MacLeodsand Davie Scotch
a cousin of Davie MacDougall newly arrived from Scotland he placed
them in positions which commanded the store entrance and waited until
the settlers had all departed upon their expedition against the invading
Indians Foxy with one or two smaller boys was left in charge of the
store waiting for trade

In a few moments Foxys head appeared at the door when whiz a
snowball skinned his ear and flattened itself with a bang against the
slabs

Hold on there Stop that Youre too close up shouted Foxy thinking
that the invaders were breaking the rules of the game

Bang a snowball from another quarter caught him fair in the neck

Here you fools you Stop that cried Foxy turning in the direction
whence the snowball came and dodging round to the side of the store
But this was Hughies point of attack and soon Foxy found that the only
place of refuge was inside whither he fled closing the door after him
Immediately the door became a target for the hidden foe

Meantime the Indian war was progressing but now and again a settler
would return to the fort for ammunition and the moment he reached the
door a volley of snowballs would catch him and hasten his entrance Once
in it was dangerous to come out

By degrees Hughie augmented his besieging force from the more
adventurous settlers and Indians and placed them in the bush
surrounding the door

The war game was demoralized but the new game proved so much more
interesting that it was taken up with enthusiasm and prosecuted with
vigor It was rare sport For the whole noon hour Hughie and his
bombarding force kept Foxy and his friends in close confinement from
which they were relieved only by the ringing of the school bell for at
the sound of the bell Hughie and his men having had their game fled
from Foxys wrath to the shelter of the school

When Foxy appeared it was discovered that one eye was half shut but the
light that gleamed from the other was sufficiently baleful to give token
of the wrath blazing within and Hughie was not a little anxious to know
what form Foxys vengeance would take But to his surprise by the time
recess had come Foxys wrath had apparently vanished and he was willing
to treat Hughies exploit in the light of a joke The truth was Foxy
never allowed passion to interfere with business and hence he resolved
that he must swallow his rage for he realized clearly that Hughie
was far too dangerous as a foe and that he might become exceedingly
valuable as an ally Within a week Hughie was Foxys partner in
business enjoying hugely the privilege of dispensing the store goods
with certain perquisites that naturally attached to him as storekeeper



CHAPTER VIII

FOXYS PARTNER


It was an evil day for Hughie when he made friends with Foxy and became
his partner in the store business for Hughies hoardings were never
large and after buying a Christmas present for his mother according
to his unfailing custom they were reduced to a very few pennies indeed
The opportunities for investment in his new position were many and
alluring But all Hughies soul went out in longing for a pistol which
Foxy had among his goods and which would fire not only caps but powder
and ball and his longing was sensibly increased by Foxy generously
allowing him to try the pistol first at a mark which Hughie hit and
then at a red squirrel which he missed By day Hughie yearned for this
pistol by night he dreamed of it but how he might secure it for his
own he did not know

Upon this point he felt he could not consult his mother his usual
counselor for he had an instinctive feeling that she would not approve
of his having a pistol in his possession and as for his father Hughie
knew he would soon make short work of any such folly What would a
child like Hughie do with a pistol He had never had a pistol in all his
life It was difficult for the minister to realize that young Canada was
a new type and he would have been more than surprised had any one told
him that already Hughie although only twelve was an expert with a gun
having for many a Saturday during the long sunny fall roamed the woods
at first in company with Don and afterwards with Dons gun alone or
followed by Fusie or Davie Scotch There was thus no help for Hughie at
home The price of the pistol reduced to the lowest possible sum was
two dollars and a half which Foxy declared was only half what he would
charge any one else but his partner

How much have you got altogether he asked Hughie one day when Hughie
was groaning over his poverty

Six pennies and two dimes was Hughies disconsolate reply He had
often counted them over Of course he went on theres my XL knife
Thats worth a lot only the point of the big blades broken

Huh grunted Foxy theres jist the stub left

Its not said Hughie indignantly Its more than half then And
its bully good stuff too Itll nick any knife in the school and
Hughie dived into his pocket and pulled out his knife with a handful of
boys treasures

Hullo said Foxy snatching a halfdollar from Hughies hand whose
is that

Here you give me that Thats not mine cried Hughie

Whose is it then

I dont know I guess its mothers I found it on the kitchen floor
and I know its mothers

How do you know

I know well enough She often puts money on the window and it fell
down Give me that I tell you Hughies eyes were blazing dangerously
and Foxy handed back the halfdollar

O all right Youre a pretty big fool he said indifferently
Losers seekers finders keepers Thats my rule

Hughie was silent holding his precious halfdollar in his hand deep in
his pocket

Say said Foxy changing the subject I guess you had better pay up
for your powder and caps youve been firing

I havent been firing much said Hughie confidently

Well youve been firing pretty steady for three weeks

Three weeks It isnt three weeks

It is Theres this week and last week when the inkbottle bust too
soon and burnt Fusies eyebrows and the week before when you shot Aleck
Dan and it was the week before that you began and thatll make it
four

How much asked Hughie desperately resolved to know the worst

Foxy had been preparing for this He took down a slatepencil box with a
sliding lid and drew out a bundle of crumbled slips which Hughie with
sinking heart recognized as his own vouchers

Sixteen pennies Foxy had taken care of this part of the business

Sixteen exclaimed Hughie snatching up the bunch

Count them yourself said Foxy calmly knowing well he could count on
Hughies honesty

Seventeen said Hughie hopelessly

But one of those I didnt count said Foxy generously Thats the
one I gave you to try at the first Now I tell you went on Foxy
insinuatingly you have got how much at home he inquired

Six pennies and two dimes Hughies tone indicated despair

Youve got six pennies and two dimes Six pennies and two dimes Thats
twentythats thirtytwo cents Now if you paid me that thirtytwo
cents and if you could get a halfdollar anywhere that would be
eightytwo I tell you what I would do I would let you have that pistol
for only one dollar more That aint much he said

Only a dollar more said Hughie calculating rapidly But where would
I get the fifty cents The dollar seemed at that moment to Hughie quite
a possible thing if only the fifty cents could be got The dollar was
more remote and therefore less pressing

Foxy had an inspiration

I tell you what You borrow that fifty cents you found and then you
can pay me eightytwo cents andand he hesitatedperhaps you will
find some more or something

Hughies eyes were blazing with great fierceness

Foxy hastened to add And Ill let you have the pistol right off and
youll pay me again some time when you can the other dollar

Hughie checked the indignant answer that was at his lips To have the
pistol as his own to take home with him at night and to keep all
Saturdaythe temptation was great and coming suddenly upon Hughie
was too much for him He would surely somehow soon pay back the fifty
cents he argued and Foxy would wait for the dollar And yet that
halfdollar was not his but his mothers and more than that if he
asked her for it he was pretty sure she would refuse But then he
doubted his mothers judgment as to his ability to use firearms and
besides this pistol at that price was a great bargain and any of the
boys might pick it up Poor Hughie He did not know how ancient was that
argument nor how frequently it had done duty in smoothing the descent
to the lower regions The pistol was good to look at the opportunity
of securing it was such as might not occur again and as for the
halfdollar there could be no harm in borrowing that for a little
while

That was Foxys day of triumph but to Hughie it was the beginning of
many woeful days and nights And his misery came upon him swift and
sure in the very moment that he turned in from the road at the manse
gate for he knew that at the end of the lane would be his mother and
his winged feet upon which he usually flew from the gate home dragged
heavily

He found his mother not at the door but in the large pleasant
livingroom which did for all kinds of rooms in the manse It was
diningroom and sewingroom nursery and playroom but it was always
a good room to enter and in spite of playthings strewn about or
snippings of cloth or other stour it was always a place of brightness
and of peace for it was there the mother was most frequently to be
found This evening she was at the sewingmachine busy with Hughies
Sunday clothes with the baby asleep in the cradle beside her in spite
of the din of the flying wheels and little Robbie helping to pull
through the long seam Hughie shrank from the warm bright loving
atmosphere that seemed to fill the room hating to go in but in a
moment he realized that he must make believe with his mother and the
pain of it and the shame of it startled and amazed him He was glad that
his mother did not notice him enter and by the time he had put away
his books he had braced himself to meet her bright smile and her welcome
kiss

The mother did not apparently notice his hesitation

Well my boy home again she cried holding out her hand to him with
the air of good comradeship she always wore with him Are you very
hungry

You bet said Hughie kissing her and glad of the chance to get away

Well you will find something pretty nice in the pantry we saved for
you Guess what

Dont know

I know shouted Robbie Pie Its muzzies pie Muzzie tept it for
oo

Now Robbie you were not to tell said his mother shaking her finger
at him

Ooo I fordot said Robbie horrified at his failure to keep his
promise

Never mind Thats a lesson you will have to learn many times how to
keep those little lips shut And the pie will be just as good

Thank you mother said Hughie But I dont want your pie

My pie said the mother Pie isnt good for old women

Old women said Hughie indignantly Youre the youngest and
prettiest woman in the congregation he cried and forgetting for the
moment his sense of meanness he threw his arms round his mother

Oh Hughie shame on you What a dreadful flatterer you are said his
mother Now run away to your pie and then to your evening work my
boy and we will have a good lesson together after supper

Hughie ran away glad to get out of her presence and seizing the pie
carried it out to the barn and hurled it far into the snow He felt sure
that a single bite of it would choke him

If he could only have seen Foxy any time for the next hour how gladly
would he have given him back his pistol but by the time he had fed
his cow and the horses split the wood and carried it in and prepared
kindling for the mornings fires he had become accustomed to his new
self and had learned his first lesson in keeping his emotions out of
his face But from that night and through all the long weeks of the
breaking winter when games in the woods were impossible by reason
of the snow and water and when the roads were deep with mud Hughie
carried his burden with him till life was one long weariness and dread

And through these days he was Foxys slave A pistol without ammunition
was quite useless Foxys stock was near at hand It was easy to write a
voucher for a pennys worth of powder or caps and consequently the pile
in Foxys pencilbox steadily mounted till Hughie was afraid to look at
it His chance of being free from his own conscience was still remote
enough

During these days too Foxy reveled in his power over his rival and
ground his slave in bitter bondage subjecting him to such humiliation
as made the school wonder and Hughie writhe and if ever Hughie showed
any sign of resentment or rebellion Foxy could tame him to groveling
submission by a single word Well I guess Ill go down tonight to see
your mother was all he needed to say to make Hughie grovel again
For with Hughie it was not the fear of his fathers wrath and heavy
punishment though that was terrible enough but the dread that his
mother should know that made him grovel before his tyrant and wake at
night in a cold sweat His mothers tender anxiety for his pale face and
gloomy looks only added to the misery of his heart

He had no one in whom he could confide He could not tell any of the
boys for he was unwilling to lose their esteem besides it was none
of their business he was terrified of his fathers wrath and from his
mother his usual and unfailing resort in every trouble of his whole
life he was now separated by his terrible secret

Then Foxy began to insist upon payment of his debts Spring was at hand
the store would soon be closed up for business was slack in the summer
and besides Foxy had other use for his money

Havent you got any money at all in your house Foxy sneered one day
when Hughie was declaring his inability to meet his debts

Of course we have cried Hughie indignantly

Dont believe it said Foxy contemptuously

Fathers drawer is sometimes full of dimes and halfdimes At least
theres an awful lot on Mondays from the collections you know said
Hughie

Well then you had better get some for me somehow said Foxy You
might borrow some from the drawer for a little while

That would be stealing said Hughie

You wouldnt mean to keep it said Foxy You would only take it for a
while It would just be borrowing

It wouldnt said Hughie firmly Its taking out of his drawer Its
stealing and I wont steal

Huh youre mighty good all at once What about that halfdollar

You said yourself that wasnt stealing said Hughie passionately

Well whats the difference You said it was your mothers and this is
your fathers Its all the same except that youre afraid to take your
fathers

Im not afraid At least it isnt that But its different to take
money out of a drawer that isnt your own

Huh Mighty lot of difference Moneys money wherever it is Besides
if you borrowed this from your father you could pay back your mother
and me You would pay the whole thing right off

Once more Hughie argued with himself To be free from Foxys hateful
tyranny and to be clear again with his motherfor that he would be
willing to suffer almost anything But to take money out of that drawer
was awfully like stealing Of course he would pay it back and after all
it would only be borrowing Besides it would enable him to repay what
he owed to his mother and to Foxy Through all the mazes of specious
argument Hughie worked his way arriving at no conclusion except that
he carried with him a feeling that if he could by some means get that
money out of the drawer in a way that would not be stealing it would be
a vast relief greater than words could tell

That night brought him the opportunity His father and mother were away
at the prayer meeting There was only Jessie left in the house and she
was busy with the younger children With the firm resolve that he would
not take a single halfdime from his fathers drawer he went into the
study He would like to see if the drawer were open Yes it was open
and the Sabbaths collection lay there with all its shining invitation
He tried making up the dollar and a half out of the dimes and
halfdimes What a lot of halfdimes it took But when he used the
quarters and dimes how much smaller the piles were Only two quarters
and five dimes made up the dollar and the pile in the drawer looked
pretty much the same as before Another quarterdollar withdrawn from
the drawer made little difference He looked at the little heaps on
the table He believed he could make Foxy take that for his whole debt
though he was sure he owed him more Perhaps he had better make certain
He transferred two more dimes and a halfdime from the drawer to the
table It was an insignificant little heap That would certainly clear
off his whole indebtedness and make him a free man

He slipped the little heaps of money from the table into his pocket and
then suddenly he realized that he had never decided to take the money
The last resolve he could remember making was simply to see how the
dollar and a half looked Without noticing he had passed the point of
final decision Alas like many another Hughie found the going easy and
the slipping smooth upon the down incline Unconsciously he had slipped
into being a thief

Now he could not go back His absorbing purpose was concealment Quietly
shutting the drawer he was slipping hurriedly up to his own room when
on the stairway he met Jessie

What are you doing here Jessie he asked sharply

Putting Robbie off to bed said Jessie in surprise Whats the
matter with you

Whats the matter echoed Hughie smitten with horrible fear that
perhaps she knew I just wanted to know he said weakly

He slipped past her holding his pocket tight lest the coins should
rattle When he reached his room he stood listening in the dark to
Jessie going down the stairs He was sure she suspected something
He would go back and put the money in the drawer again whenever she
reached the kitchen He stood there with his heartbeats filling his
ears waiting for the kitchen door to slam

Then he resolved he would wrap the money up in paper and put it safely
away and go down and see if Jessie knew He found one of his old
copybooks and began tearing out a leaf What a noise it made Robbie
would surely wake up and then Jessie would come back with the light He
put the copybook under the quilt and holding it down firmly with one
hand removed the leaf with the other With great care he wrapped up the
dimes and halfdimes by themselves They fitted better together Then
he took up the quarters and was proceeding to fold them in a similar
parcel when he heard Jessies voice from below

Hughie what are you doing She was coming up the stair

He jumped from the bed to go to meet her A quarter fell on the floor
and rolled under the bed It seemed to Hughie as if it would never stop
rolling and as if Jessie must hear it Wildly he scrambled on the
floor in the dark seeking for the quarter while Jessie came nearer and
nearer

Are you going to bed already Hughie she asked

Quickly Hughie went out to the hall to meet her

Yes he yawned gratefully seizing upon her suggestion Im awfully
sleepy Give me the candle Jessie he said snatching it from her
hand I want to go downstairs

Hughie you are very rude What would your mother say Let me have the
candle immediately I want to get Robbies stockings

Hughies heart stood still

Ill throw them down Jessie I want the candle downstairs just a
minute

Leave that candle with me insisted Jessie Theres another on the
diningroom table you can get

Ill not be a minute said Hughie hurrying downstairs You come
down Jessie I want to ask you something Ill throw you Robbies
stockings

Come back here the rude boy that you are said Jessie crossly and
bring me that candle

There was no reply Hughie was standing pale and shaking in the
diningroom listening intently for Jessies step Would she go into his
room or would she come down Every moment increased the agony of his
fear

At length with a happy inspiration he went to the cupboard opened the
door noisily and began rattling the dishes

Mercy me he heard Jessie exclaim at the top of the stair That boy
will be my death Hughie she called just shut that cupboard You
know your mother doesnt like you to go in there

I only want a little called out Hughie still moving the dishes and
hearing to his great relief Jessies descending step In desperation
he seized a dish of black currant preserves which he found on the
cupboard shelf and spilled it over the dishes and upon the floor just
as Jessie entered the room

Land sakes alive boy Will you never be done your mischief she
cried rushing toward him

Oh he said I spilt it

Spilt it echoed Jessie indignantly you neednt be telling me that
Bring me a cloth from the kitchen

I dont know where it is Jessie cried Hughie slipping upstairs
again with his candle

To his great relief he saw that Jessies attention was so entirely taken
up with removing the stains of the preserves from the cupboard shelves
and dishes that she for the moment forgot everything else Robbies
stockings included

Hurrying to his room and shading the candle with his hand lest the
light should waken his little brother he hastily seized the money upon
the bed quilt and after a few moments searching under the bed found
the strayed quarter

With these in his hand he passed into his mothers room Leaving the
candle there he came back to the head of the stairs and listened for
a moment with great satisfaction to Jessie muttering to herself while
she cleaned up the mess he had made Then he turned and with trembling
fingers he swiftly made up the quarterdollars into another parcel With
a great sigh of relief he put the two parcels in his pocket and seizing
his candle turned to leave the room As he did so he caught sight of
himself in the glass With a great shock of surprise he stood gazing at
the terrified white face with the staring eyes

What a fool I am he said looking at himself in the glass Nobody
will know and Ill pay this back soon

His eyes wandered to a picture which stood on a little shelf beside the
glass It was a picture of his mother the one he loved best of all he
had ever seen of her

There was a sudden stab of pain at his heart his breath came in a great
sob For a moment he looked into the eyes that looked back at him so
full of love and reproach

I wont do it he said grinding his teeth hard and forthwith turned
to go to his fathers study

But as he left the room he saw Jessie halfway up the stairs

What are you doing now she cried wrathfully Up to some mischief I
doubt

With a sudden inexplicable rage Hughie turned toward her

Its none of your business You mind your own business will you and
leave me alone The terrible emotions of the last few minutes were at
the back of his rage

Just wait you said Jessie till your mother comes Then youll hear
it

You shut your mouth cried Hughie his passion sweeping his whole
being like a tempest You shut your mouth you old cat or Ill throw
this candle at you He raised the candle high in his hand as he spoke
and altogether looked so desperate that Jessie stood in terror lest he
should make good his threat

Stop now Hughie she entreated You will be setting the house on
fire

Hughie hesitated a moment and then turned from her and going into his
room banged the door in her face and Jessie not knowing what to make
of it all went slowly downstairs again forgetting once more Robbies
stockings

The old cat said Hughie to himself She just stopped me I was going
to put it back

The memory that he had resolved to undo his wrong brought him a curious
sense of relief

I was just going to put it back he said when she had to interfere

He was conscious of a sense of injury against Jessie It was not his
fault that that money was not now in the drawer

Ill put it back in the morning anyhow he said firmly But even as
he spoke he was conscious of an infinality in his determination while
he refused to acknowledge to himself a secret purpose to leave the
question open till the morning But this determination inconclusive
though it was brought him a certain calm of mind so that when his
mother came into his room she found him sound asleep

She stood beside his bed looking down upon him for a few moments with
face full of anxious sadness

Theres something wrong with the boy she said to herself stooping to
kiss him Theres something wrong with him she repeated as she left
the room Hes not the same

During these weeks she had been conscious that Hughie had changed in
some way to her The old full frank confidence was gone There was
a constraint in his manner she could not explain He is no longer
a child she would say to herself seeking to allay the pain in her
heart A boy must have his secrets It is foolish in me to think
anything else Besides he is not well He is growing too fast And
indeed Hughies pale miserable face gave ground enough for this
opinion

That boy is not well she said to her husband

Which boy

Hughie she replied He is looking miserable and somehow he is
different

Oh nonsense He eats well enough and sleeps well enough said her
husband making light of her fears

Theres something wrong repeated his wife And he hates his school

Well I dont wonder at that said her husband sharply I dont see
how any boy of spirit could take much pleasure in that kind of a school
The boys are just wasting their time and worse than that they have
lost all the old spirit I must see to it that the policy of those
closefisted trustees is changed I am not going to put up with those
chits of girls teaching any longer

There may be something in what you say said his wife sadly but
certainly Hughie is always begging to stay at home from school

And indeed he might as well stay home answered her husband for all
the good he gets

I do wish we had a good man in charge replied his wife with a great
sigh It is very important that these boys should have a good strong
man over them How much it means to a boy at Hughies time of life But
so few are willing to come away into the backwoods here for so small a
salary

Suddenly her husband laid down his pipe

I have it he exclaimed The very thing Wouldnt this be the very
thing for young Craven You remember the young man that Professor
MacLauchlan was writing about

His wife shook her head very decidedly

Not at all she said Didnt Professor MacLauchlan say he was
dissipated

O just a little wild Got going with some loose companions Out here
there would be no temptation

I am not at all sure of that said his wife and I would not like
Hughie to be under his influence

MacLauchlan says he is a young man of fine disposition and of fine
parts argued her husband and if temptation were removed from him he
believes he would turn out a good man

Mrs Murray shook her head doubtfully He is not the man to put Hughie
under just now

What are we to do with Hughie replied her husband He is getting no
good in the school as it is and we cannot send him away yet

Send him away exclaimed his wife No no not a child like that

Craven might be a very good man continued her husband He might
perhaps live with us I know you have more than enough to do now he
added answering her look of dismay but he would be a great help to
Hughie with his lessons and might start him in his classics And then
who knows what you might make of the young man

Mrs Murray did not respond to her husbands smile but only replied
I am sure I wish I knew what is the matter with the boy and I wish he
could leave school for a while

O the boy is all right said her husband impatiently Only a little
less noisy as far as I can see

No he is not the same replied his wife He is different to me
There was almost a cry of pain in her voice

Now now dont imagine things Boys are full of notions at Hughies
age He may need a change but that is all

With this the mother tried to quiet the tumult of anxious fear and pain
she found rising in her heart but long after the house was still and
while both her boy and his father lay asleep she kept pouring forth
that ancient sacrifice of selfeffacing love before the feet of God



CHAPTER IX

HUGHIES EMANCIPATION


Hughie rose late next morning and the hurry and rush of getting off to
school in time left him no opportunity to get rid of the little packages
in his pocket that seemed to burn and sting him through his clothes He
determined to keep them safe in his pocket all day and put them back in
the drawer at night His mothers face white with her long watching
and sad and anxious in spite of its brave smile filled him with such
an agony of remorse that hurrying through his breakfast he snatched a
farewell kiss and then tore away down the lane lest he should be forced
to confess all his terrible secret

The first person who met him in the schoolyard was Foxy

Have you got that was his salutation

A sudden fury possessed Hughie

Yes you redheaded sneaking fox he answered and I hope it will
bring you the curse of luck anyway

Foxy hurried him cautiously behind the school with difficulty
concealing his delight while Hughie unrolled his little bundles and
counted out the quarters and dimes and half dimes into his hand

Theres a dollar and theres a quarter andandtheres another he
added desperately and God may kill me on the spot if I give you any
more

All right Hughie said Foxy soothingly putting the money into his
pocket You neednt be so mad about it You bought the pistol and the
rest right enough didnt you

I know I did butbut you made me you big sneaking thiefand then
you Hughies voice broke in his rage His face was pale and his
black eyes were glittering with fierce fury and in his heart he was
conscious of a wild longing to fall upon Foxy and tear him to pieces
And Foxy big and tall as he was glanced at Hughies face and saying
not a word turned and fled to the front of the school where the other
boys were

Hughie followed slowly his heart still swelling with furious rage and
full of an eager desire to be at Foxys smiling fat face

At the school door stood Miss Morrison the teacher smiling down
upon Foxy who was looking up at her with an expression of such sweet
innocence that Hughie groaned out between his clenched teeth Oh you
redheaded devil you Some day Ill make you smile out of the other
side of your big fat mouth

Who are you swearing at It was Fusie

Oh Fusie cried Hughie lets get Davie and get into the woods Im
not going in today I hate the beastly place and the whole gang of
them

Fusie the little harumscarum French waif was ready for anything in
the way of adventure To him anything was better than the even monotony
of the school routine True it might mean a whipping both from the
teacher and from Mrs McLeod but as to the teachers whipping Fusie
was prepared to stand that for a free day in the woods and as to the
other Fusie declared that Mrs McLeods whipping wouldnt hurt a
skeeter

To Davie Scotch however playing truant was a serious matter He had
been reared in an atmosphere of reverence for established law and order
but when Hughie gave command to Davie there seemed nothing for it but
to obey

The three boys watched till the school was called and then crawling
along on their stomachs behind the heavy cedarlog fence they slipped
into the balsam thicket at the edge of the woods and were safe Here
they flung down their schoolbags and lying prone upon the fragrant bed
of pineneedles strewn thickly upon the moss they peered out through
the balsam boughs at the house of their bondage with an exultant sense
of freedom and a feeling of pity if not of contempt for the unhappy
and spiritless creatures who were content to be penned inside any house
on such a day as this and with such a world outside

For some minutes they rolled about upon the soft moss and balsamneedles
and the brown leaves of last year till their hearts were running over
with a deep and satisfying delight It is hard to resist the ministry of
the woods The sympathetic silence of the trees the aromatic airs
that breathe through the shady spaces the soft mingling of broken
lightsthese all combine to lay upon the spirit a soothing balm and
bring to the heart peace And Hughie sensitive at every pore to that
soothing ministry before long forgot for a time even Foxy with his
fat white face and smiling mouth and lying on the broad of his back
and looking up at the faraway blue sky through the interlacing branches
and leaves he began to feel again that it was good to be alive and
that with all his misery there were compensations

But any lengthened period of peaceful calm is not for boys of the age
and spirit of Hughie and his companions

What are you going to do asked Fusie the man of adventure

Do nothing said Hughie from his supine position This is good enough
for me

Not me said Fusie starting to climb a tall lithe birch while
Hughie lazily watched him Soon Fusie was at the top of the birch which
began to sway dangerously

Try to fly into that balsam cried Hughie

No sir

Yes go on

Cant do it

Oh pshaw you can

No nor you either Thats a mighty big jump

Come on down then and let me try said Hughie in scorn His
laziness was gone in the presence of a possible achievement

In a few minutes he had taken Fusies place a the top of the swaying
birch It did not look so easy from the top of the birch as from the
ground to swing into the balsamtree However he could not go back now

Dinna try it Hughie cried Davie to him Yell no mak it and yell
come an awfu cropper as sure as deith But Hughie swaying gently
back and forth was measuring the distance of his drop It was not
a feat so very difficult but it called for good judgment and steady
nerve A moment too soon or a moment too late in letting go would mean
a nasty fall of twenty feet or more upon the solid ground and one never
knew just how one would light

I wudna dae it Hughie urged Davie anxiously

But Hughie swaying high in the birch heeded not the warning and
suddenly swinging out from the slender trunk and holding by his hands
he described a parabola and releasing the birch dropped on to the
balsam top But balsamtrees are of uncertain fiber and not to be
relied upon and this particular balsam breaking off short in Hughies
hands allowed him to go crashing through the branches to the earth

Man man cried Davie Scotch bending over Hughie as he lay white
and still upon the ground Are ye deid Maircy me hes deid sobbed
Davie wringing his hands Fusie Fusie ye gowk where are ye gone

In a moment or two Fusie reappeared through the branches with a capful
of water and dashed it into Hughies face with the result that the lad
opened his eyes and after a gasp or two sat up and looked about him

Och laddie laddie are ye no deid said Davie Scotch

Whats the matter with you Scottie asked Hughie with a bewildered
look about him And whos been throwing water all over me he added
wrathfully as full consciousness returned

Man Im glad to see ye mad Gang on wi ye shouted Davie joyously
Ye were deid the noo Ay clean deid Was he no Fusie Fusie nodded

I guess not said Hughie It was that rotten balsam top looking
vengefully at the broken tree

Lie doon man said Davie still anxiously hovering about him Dinna
rise yet awhile

Oh pshaw said Hughie and he struggled to his feet Im all right
But as he spoke he sank down upon the moss saying I feel kind of
queer though

Lie still then will ye said Davie angrily Yere fair obstinate

Get me some water Fusie said Hughie rather weakly

Run Fusie ye gomeril ye

In a minute Fusie was back with a capful of water

Thats better Im all right now said Hughie sitting up

Hear him said Davie Lie ye doon there or Ill gie ye a crack
thatll mak ye glad tae keep still

For half an hour the boys lay on the moss discussing the accident fully
in all its varying aspects and possibilities till the sound of wheels
came up the road

Whos that Fusie asked Hughie lazily

Dunno me said Fusie peering through the trees

Do you Scotty

No not I

Hughie crawled over to the edge of the brush

Why you idiots its Thomas Finch Thomas he called but Thomas
drove straight on In a moment Hughie sprang up forgetting all about
his weakness and ran out to the roadside

Hello Thomas he cried waving his hand Thomas saw him stopped and
looked at him doubtfully He with all the Section knew how the school
was going and he easily guessed what took Hughie there

Im not going to school today said Hughie answering Thomass look

Thomas nodded and sat silent waiting He was not a man to waste his
words

I hate the whole thing exclaimed Hughie

Foxy eh said Thomas to whom on other occasions Hughie had confided
his grievances and especially those he suffered at the hands of Foxy

Yes Foxy cried Hughie in a sudden rage Hes a fatfaced sneak
And the teacher just makes me sick

Thomas still waited

She just smiles and smiles at him and he smiles at her Ugh I cant
stand him

Not much harm in smiling said Thomas solemnly

Oh Thomas I hate the school Im not going to go any more

Thomas looked gravely down upon Hughies passionate face for a few
moments and then said You will do what your mother wants you I
guess

Hughie said nothing in reply while Thomas sat pondering

Finally he said with a sudden inspiration Hughie come along with me
and help me with the potatoes

They wont let me grumbled Hughie At least father wont I dont
like to ask mother

Thomass eyes opened in surprise This was a new thing in Hughie

Ill ask your mother he said at length Get in with me here

Still Hughie hesitated To get away from school was joy enough to go
with Thomas to the potato planting was more than could be hoped for But
still he stood making pictures in the dust with his bare toes

Theres Fusie he said and Davie Scotch

Well said Thomas catching sight of those worthies through the trees
let them come too

Fusie was promptly willing but Davie was doubtful He certainly would
not go to the manse where he might meet the minister and meeting the
ministers wife under the present circumstances was a little worse

Well you can wait at the gate with Fusie suggested Hughie and so
the matter was settled

Fortunately for Hughie his father was not at home But not Thomass
earnest entreaties nor Hughies eager pleading would have availed with
the mother for attendance at school was a sacred duty in her eyes had
it not been that her boys face paler than usual and with the dawning
of a new defiance in it startled her and confirmed in her the fear
that all was not well with him

Well Thomas he may go with you to the Camerons for the potatoes but
as to going with you to the planting that is another thing Your mother
is not fit to be troubled with another boy and especially a boy like
Hughie And how is she today Thomas continued Mrs Murray as Thomas
stood in dull silence before her

Shes better said Thomas answering more quickly than usual and with
a certain eagerness in his voice Shes a great deal better and Hughie
will do her no harm but good

Mrs Murray looked at Thomas as he spoke wondering at the change in his
voice and manner The heavy stolid face had changed since she had last
seen it It was finer keener than before The eyes so often dull
were lighted up with a new strange fire

Shes much better said Thomas again as if insisting against Mrs
Murrays unbelief

I am glad to hear it Thomas she said gently She will soon
be quite well again I hope for she has had a long long time of
suffering

Yes a long long time replied Thomas His face was pale and in his
eyes was a look of pain almost of fear

And you will come to see her soon he added There was almost a
piteous entreaty in his tone

Yes Thomas surely next week And meantime I shall let Hughie go with
you

A look of such utter devotion poured itself into Thomass eyes that
Mrs Murray was greatly moved and putting her hand on his shoulder
she said gently He will give His angels charge Dont be afraid
Thomas

Afraid said Thomas with a kind of gasp his face going white
Afraid No Why But Mrs Murray turned from him to hide the tears
that she could not keep out of her eyes for she knew what was before
Thomas and them all

Meantime Hughie was busy putting into his little carpetbag what he
considered the necessary equipment for his visit

You must wear your shoes Hughie

Oh mother shoes are such an awful bother planting potatoes They get
full of ground and everything

Well put them in your bag at any rate and your stockings too You
may need them

By degrees Hughies very moderate necessities were satisfied and with a
hurried farewell to his mother he went off with Thomas At the gate they
picked up Fusie and Davie Scotch and went off to the Camerons for the
seed potatoes Hughies heart lighter than it had been for many a day
And all through the afternoon and as he drove home with Thomas on
the loaded bags his heart kept singing back to the birds in the trees
overhead

It was late in the afternoon when they drove into the yard for the
roads were still bad in the swamp where the corduroy had been broken up
by the spring floods

Thomas hurried through unhitching and without waiting to unharness
he stood the horses in their stalls saying We may need them this
afternoon again and took Hughie off to the house straightway

The usual beautiful order pervaded the house and its surroundings
The back yard through which the boys came from the barn was free
of litter the chips were raked into neat little piles close to the
woodpile for summer use On a bench beside the stoop door was a row
of milkpans lapping each other like scales on a fish glittering
in the sun The large summer kitchen with its spotless floor and
whitewashed walls stood with both its doors open to the sweet air that
came in from the fields above and was as pleasant a room to look
in upon as one could desire On the sill of the open window stood
a sweetscented geranium and a tall fuschia with white and crimson
blossoms hanging in clusters Bunches of wild flowers stood on the
table on the dresser and up beside the clock and the whole room
breathed of sweet scents of fields and flowers and the name of the
chamber was peace

Beside the open window sat the little mother in an armchair the
embodiment of all the peaceful beauty and sweet fragrance of the room

Well mother said Thomas crossing the floor to her and laying his
hand upon her shoulder have I been long away I have brought Hughie
back with me you see

Not so very long Thomas said the mother her dark face lighting with
a look of love as she glanced up at her big son And I am glad to see
Hughie He will excuse me from rising she added with fine courtesy

Hughie hurried toward her

Yes indeed Mrs Finch Dont think of rising But he could get no
further Boy as he was and at the age when boys are most heartless and
regardless he found it hard to keep his lip and his voice steady and to
swallow the lump in his throat and in spite of all he could do his eyes
were filling up with tears as he looked into the little womans face so
worn and weary so pathetically bright

It was months since he had seen her and during these months a great
change had come to her and to the Finch household After suffering long
in secret the mother had been forced to confess to a severe pain in
her breast and under her arm Upon examination the doctor pronounced the
case to be malignant cancer and there was nothing for it but removal
It was what Dr Grant called a very beautiful operation indeed and
now she was recovering her strength but only slowly so slowly that
Thomas at times found his heart sink with a vague fear But it was not
the pain of the wound that had wrought that sweet pathetic look into
the little womans face but the deeper pain she carried in her heart
for those she loved better than herself

The mothers sickness brought many changes into the household but the
most striking of all the changes was that wrought in the slow and
stolid Thomas The father and Billy Jack were busy with the farm matters
outside upon little Jessac now a girl of twelve years fell the care
of the house but it was Thomas that with the assistance of a neighbor
at first but afterwards alone waited on his mother dressing the wound
and nursing her These weeks of watching and nursing had wrought in him
the subtle change that stirred Mrs Murrays heart as she looked at him
that day and that made even Hughie wonder For one thing his tongue
was loosed and Thomas talked to his mother of all that he had seen and
heard on the way to the Camerons and back making much of his little
visit to the manse and of Mrs Murrays kindness and enlarging upon
her promised visit and all with such brightness and picturesqueness
of speech that Hughie listened amazed For all the years he had known
Thomas he had never heard from his lips so many words as in the last few
minutes of talk with his mother Then too Thomas seemed to have found
his fingers for no woman could have arranged more deftly and with
gentler touch the cushions at his mothers back and no nurse could have
measured out the medicine and prepared her eggnog with greater skill
Hughie could hardly believe his eyes and ears Was this Thomas the
stolid the clumsy the heavyhanded this big fellow with the quick
tongue and the clever gentle hand

Meantime Jessac had set upon the table a large pitcher of rich milk
with oat cakes and butter and honey in the comb

Now Hughie lad draw in and help yourself You and Thomas will be
too hungry to wait for supper said the mother And Hughie protesting
politely that he was not very hungry proceeded to establish the
contrary to the great satisfaction of himself and the others

Now Thomas said the mother we had better cut the seed

Indeed and not a seed will you cut mother said Thomas
emphatically You may boss the job though Ill bring the potatoes to
the back door And this he did thinking it no trouble to hitch up the
team to draw the wagon into the back yard so that his mother might have
a part in the cutting of the seed potatoes as she had had every year of
her life on the farm

Very carefully and in spite of her protests that she could walk quite
well Thomas carried his mother out to her chair in the shade of the
house arranging with tender solicitude the pillows at her back and the
rug at her feet Then they set to work at the potatoes

Mind you have two eyes in every seed Hughie said Jessac severely

Huh I know Ive cut them often enough replied Hughie scornfully

Well look at that one now said Jessac picking up a seed that
Hughie had let fall thats only got one eye

Theres two said Hughie triumphantly

Thats not an eye said Jessac pointing to a mark on the potato
thats where the top grew out of isnt it mother

It is isnt it appealed Hughie

Mrs Finch took the seed and looked at it

Well theres one very good eye and that will do

But isnt that the mark of the top mother insisted Jessac But the
mother only shook her head at her

Thats right Jessac said Thomas driving off with his team you
look after Hughie and mother will look after you both till I get back
and therell be a grand crop this year

It was a happy hour for them all The slanting rays of the afternoon
sun filled the air with a genial warmth A little breeze bore from the
orchard near by a fragrance of appleblossoms A matronly hen tethered
by the leg to her coop raised indignant protest against the outrage on
her personal liberty or clucked and crooned her invitations counsels
warnings and encouragements in as many different tones to her
independent fluffy brood of chicks while a huge gobbler strutted
up and down thrilling with pride in the glossy magnificence of his
outspread tail and pompous mighty chest

Hughie was conscious of a deep and grateful content but across his
content lay a shadow If only that would lift As he watched Thomas with
his mother he realized how far he had drifted from his own mother and
he thought with regret of the happy days which now seemed so far in
the past when his mother had shared his every secret But for him those
days could never come again

At supper Hughie was aware of some subtle difference in the spirit of
the home As to Thomas so to his father a change had come The old man
was as silent as ever indeed more so but there was no asperity in his
silence His critical captious manner was gone His silence was that
of a great sorrow and of a great fear While there was more cheerful
conversation than ever at the table there was through all a new respect
and a certain tender consideration shown toward the silent old man at
the head and all joined in an effort to draw him from his gloom The
past months of his wifes suffering had bowed him as with the weight of
years Even Hughie could note this

After supper the old man took the Books as usual but when as High
Priest he ascended the Mount of Ordinances to offer the evening
sacrifice he was as a man walking in thick darkness bewildered and
afraid The prayer was largely a meditation on the heinousness of sin
and the righteous judgments of God and closed with an exaltation of the
Cross with an appeal that the innocent might be spared the punishment
of the guilty The conviction had settled in the old mans mind that
the Lord was visiting upon him and his family his sins his pride his
censoriousness his hardness of heart The words of his prayer fell
meaningless upon Hughies English ears but the boys heart quivered
in response to the agony of entreaty in the pleading tones and he rose
from his knees awed and subdued

There was no word spoken for some moments after the prayer With people
like the Finches it was considered to be an insult to the Almighty to
depart from the Presence with any unseemly haste Then Thomas came to
help his mother to her room but she with her eyes upon her husband
quietly put Thomas aside and said Donald will you tak me ben

Rarely had she called him by his name before the family and all felt
that this was a most unusual demonstration of tenderness on her part

The old man glanced quickly at her from under his overhanging eyebrows
and met her bright upward look with an involuntary shake of the head and
a slight sigh Comfort was not for him and he must not delude
himself But with a little laugh she put her hand on his arm and as if
administering reproof to a little child she said some words in Gaelic

Oh woman woman said Donald in reply if it was yourself we had to
deal with

Whisht man Will you be putting me before your Father in heaven she
said as they disappeared into the other room

There was no fiddle that evening There was no heart for it with
Thomas neither was there time for there was the milking to do and the
sorting of the pails and pans and the preparing for churning in the
morning so that when all was done the long evening had faded into the
twilight and it was time for bed

Before going upstairs Thomas took Hughie into the room where his
mothers bed had been placed Thomas gave her her medicine and made her
comfortable for the night

Is there nothing else now mother he said still lingering about her

No Thomas my man How are the cows doing

Grand Blossom filled a pail tonight and Spotty almost twice Shes a
great milker yon

Yes and so was her mother I remember she used to fill two pails when
the grass was good

I remember her too Her horns curled right back didnt they And she
always looked so fierce

Yes but she was a kindly cow And will the churn be ready for the
morning

Yes mother well have buttermilk for our porridge sure enough

Well youll need to be up early for that too early Thomas lad for
a boy like you

A boy like me said Thomas feigning indignation and stretching
himself to his full height Where would you be getting your men
mother

You are man enough laddie said his mother and a good one you will
come to be I doubt And you too Hughie lad she added turning to
him You will be like your father

I dunno said Hughie his face flushing scarlet He was weary and sick
of his secret and the sight of the loving comradeship between Thomas
and his mother made his burden all the heavier

Whats wrong with yon laddie asked Mrs Finch when Hughie had gone
away to bed

Now mother youre too sharp altogether And how do you know anything
is wrong with him

I warrant you his mother sees it Something is on his mind Hughie is
not the lad he used to be He will not look at you straight and that is
not like Hughie

Oh mother youre a sharp one said Thomas I thought no one had
seen that but myself Yes there is something wrong with him Its
something in the school Its a poor place nowadays anyway and I wish
Hughie were done with it

He must keep at the school Thomas and I only wish you could do the
same His mother sighed She had her own secret ambition for Thomas
and though she never opened her heart to her son or indeed to any one
Thomas somehow knew that it was her hearts desire to see him in the
pulpit

Never you mind mother he said brightly Itll all come right
Arent you always the one preaching faith to me

Yes laddie and it is needed and sorely at times

Now mither said Thomas dropping into her native speech ye mauna
be fashin yersel Yell jist say Now I lay me and gang to sleep like
a bairnie

Ay thats a guid word laddie an all tak it Ye may kiss me guid
nicht All tak it

Thomas bent over her and whispered in her ear Ay mither mither
yere an angel and that ye are

Hoots laddie gang awa wi ye said his mother but she held her arms
about his neck and kissed him once and again There was no one to see
and why should they not give and take their hearts fill of love

But when Thomas stood outside the room door he folded his arms tight
across his breast and whispered with lips that quivered Ay mither
mither mither theres nane like ye Theres nane like ye And he was
glad that when he went upstairs he found Hughie unwilling to talk

The next three days they were all busy with the planting of the
potatoes and nothing could have been better for Hughie The sweet
sunny air and the kindly wholesome earth and honest hard work were
life and health to mind and heart and body It is wonderful how the
touch of the kindly mother earth cleanses the soul from its unwholesome
humors The hours that Hughie spent in working with the clean red earth
seemed somehow to breathe virtue into him He remembered the past months
like a bad dream They seemed to him a hideous unreality and he could
not think of Foxy and his schemes nor of his own weakness in yielding
to temptation without a horrible selfloathing He became aware of a
strange feeling of sympathy and kinship with old Donald Finch He seemed
to understand his gloom During those days their work brought those two
together for Billy Jack had the running of the drills and to Thomas
was intrusted the responsibility of dropping the potatoes so Hughie
and the old man undertook to cover after Thomas

Side by side they hoed together speaking not a word for an hour at a
time but before long the old man appeared to feel the lads sympathy
Hughie was quick to save him steps and eager in many ways to anticipate
his wishes He was quick too with the hoe and ambitious to do his
full share of the work and this won the old mans respect so that
by the end of the first day there was established between them a solid
basis of friendship

Old Donald Finch was no cheerful companion for Hughie but it was to
Hughie a relief more than anything else that he was not much with
either Thomas or Billy Jack

Youre tired he ventured in answer to a deep sigh from the old man
toward the close of the day

No laddie replied the old man I know not that I am working The
burden of toil is the least of all our burdens And then after a
pause he added It is a terrible thing is sin

To an equal in age the old man would never have ventured this
confidence but to Hughie to his own surprise he found it easy to
talk

A terrible thing he repeated and it will always be finding you
out

Hughie listened to him with a fearful sinking of heart thinking of
himself and his sin

Yes repeated the old man with awful solemnity it will come up with
you at last

But ventured Hughie timidly wont God forgive Wont he ever
forget

The old man looked at him leaning upon his hoe

Yes he will forgive But for those who have had great privileges and
who have sinned against lightI will not say

The fear deepened in Hughies heart

Do you mean that God will not forgive a man who has had a good chance
an elder or a minister orora ministers son say like me

There was something in Hughies tone that startled the old man He
glanced at Hughies face

What am I saying he cried It is of myself I am thinking boy and
of no minister or ministers son

But Hughie stood looking at him his face showing his terrible anxiety
God and sin were vivid realities to him

Yes yes said the old man to himself it is a great gospel As far
as the east is distant from the west And plenteous redemption is ever
found with him

But do you think said Hughie in a low voice God will tell all our
sins Will he make them known

God forbid cried the old man And their sins and their iniquities
will I remember no more The depths of the sea No no boy he will
surely forget and he will not be proclaiming them

It was a strange picture The old man leaning upon the top of his
hoe looking over at the lad the gloom of his face irradiated with a
momentary gleam of hope and the boy looking back at him with almost
breathless eagerness

It would be great said Hughie at last if he would forget

Yes said the old man the gleam in his face growing brighter If we
confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and forgiving
with him is forgetting Ah yes it is a great gospel he continued
and standing there he lifted up his hand and broke into a kind of chant
in Gaelic of which Hughie could catch no meaning but the exalted look
on the old mans face was translation enough

Must we always tell said Hughie after the old man had ceased

What are you saying laddie

I say must we always tell our sinsI mean to people

The old man thought a moment It is not always good to be talking about
our sins to people That is for God to hear But we must be ready to
make right what is wrong

Yes yes said Hughie eagerly of course one would be glad to do
that

The old man gave him one keen glance and began hoeing again

Yed better be asking yere mother about that She will know

No no said Hughie I cant

The old man paused in his work looked at the boy for a moment or two
and then went on working again

Speak to my woman he said after a few strokes of his hoe Shes a
wonderful wise woman And Hughie wished that he dared

During the days of the planting they became great friends and to their
mutual good The mothers keen eyes noted the change both in Hughie and
in her husband and was glad for it It was she that suggested to Billy
Jack that he needed help in the back pasture with the stones Billy
Jack quick to take her meaning eagerly insisted that help he must
have indeed he could not get on with the plowing unless the stones
were taken off And so it came that Hughie and the old man with old Fly
hitched up in the stoneboat spent two happy and not unprofitable days
in the back pasture Gravely they discussed the high themes of Gods
sovereignty and mans freedom with all their practical issues upon
conduct and destiny Only once and that very shyly did the old man
bring round the talk to the subject of their first conversation that
meant so much to them both

The Lord will not be wanting to shame us beyond what is necessary he
said There are certain sins which he will bring to light but there
are those that in his mercy he permits us to hide provided always
he added with emphasis we are done with them

Yes indeed assented Hughie eagerly and who wouldnt be done with
them

But the old man shook his head sadly

If that were always true a man would soon be rid of his evil heart
But he continued as if eager to turn the conversation you will be
talking with my woman about it Shes a wonderful wise woman yon

Somehow the opportunity came to Hughie to take the old mans advice On
Saturday evening just before leaving for home he found himself alone
with Mrs Finch sitting beside the open window watching the sun go down
behind the trees

What a splendid sunset he cried He was ever sensitive to the
majestic drama of nature

Ay said Mrs Finch the clouds and the sun make wonderful beauty
together but without the sun the clouds are ugly things

Hughie quickly took her meaning

They are not pleasant he said

No not pleasant she replied but with the sunlight upon them they
are wonderful

Hughie was silent for some moments and then suddenly burst out Mrs
Finch does God forget sins and will he keep them hid from people I
mean

Ay she said with quiet conviction he will forget and he will hide
them Why should he lay the burden of our sins upon others And if he
does not why should we

Do you mean we need not always tell Id like to tell mysome one

Ay she replied its a weary wark and a lanely to carry it oor lane
but its an awfu grief to hear o anithers sin An awfu grief she
repeated to herself

But burst out Hughie Ill never be right till I tell my mother

Ay and then it is she would be carrying the weight o it

But its against her said Hughie his hands going up to his face
Oh Mrs Finch its just awful mean I dont know how I did it

Ye can tell me laddie if ye will said she kindly and Hughie
poured forth the whole burden that had lain so long upon him but he
told it laying upon Foxy small blame for during those days his
own part had come to bulk so large with him that Foxys was almost
forgotten

For some moments after he had done Mrs Finch sat in silence leaning
forward and patting the boys bowed head

Ay but he is rightly named she said at length

Who asked Hughie surprised

Yon storekeepin chiel Then she added But yere done wi him and
his tricks and yell stand up against him and be a man for the wee
laddies

Oh I dont know said Hughie too sick at heart and too penetrated
with the miserable sense of his own meanness and cowardice to make any
promise

And as tae yere mither laddie went on Mrs Finch it will be
a sair burden for her When Mrs Finch was greatly moved she always
dropped into her broadest Scotch

Oh yes I know said Hughie his voice now broken with sobs and
thats the worst of it If I didnt have to tell her Shell just
break her heart I know She thinks Im sooh oh The long pent up
feelings came flooding forth in groans and sobs

For some moments Mrs Finch sat quietly and then she said Listen
laddie There is Another to be thought of first

Another asked Hughie Oh yes I know But He knows already and
indeed I have often told Him But besides you say He will forget and
take it away But mother doesnt know and doesnt suspect

Well then laddie said Mrs Finch with quiet firmness let her
tell ye what to do Mak yere offer to tell her and warn her that itll
grieve ye baith and then let her say

Yes Ill do it Ill do it tonight and if she says so then Ill
tell her

And so he did and when he came back to the Finchs on Monday morning
for his mother saw that leaving school for a time would be no serious
loss and a week or two with the Finches might be a great gain he came
radiant to Mrs Finch and finding her in her chair by the open window
alone he burst forth I told her and she wouldnt let me She didnt
want to know so long as I said it was all made right And she promised
she would trust me just the same Oh shes splendid my mother And
shes coming this week to see you And I tell you I just feel likelike
anything I cant keep still Im like Fido when hes let off his chain
He just goes wild

Then after a pause he added in a graver tone And mother read
Zaccheus to me And isnt it fine how He never said a word to
himHughie was too excited to be coherentbut stood up for him
andhere Hughies voice became more graveIm going to restore
fourfold Im going to work at the hay and I fired that old pistol into
the pond and Im not afraid of Foxy any more not a bit

Hughie rushed breathlessly through his story while the dark face before
him glowed with intelligent sympathy but she only said when he had
done It is a graund thing to be free is it no



CHAPTER X

Im in a hurry Mrs Cameron and I cant very well wait said Hughie
trying to preserve an evenness of tone and not allow his excitement to
appear

Well well Whats the matter whatever When Hughie refused a bit
bannock and honey something must be seriously wrong

Nothing at all but Im just wanting Don for afor something

Well well just go to the old barn and cry at him

Hughie found Don in the old barn busy rigging up his plow for the
harvest was in and the fall plowing was soon to begin

Man Don cried Hughie in a subdued voice its the greatest thing
you ever heard

What is it now Hughie You look fairly lifted Have you seen a ghost

A ghost No something better than that I can tell you

Hughie drew near and lowered his voice while Don worked on
indifferently

Its a bear Don

Don dropped his plow His indifference vanished The Camerons were great
hunters and many a bear had they with their famous black dogs brought
home in their day but not for the past year or two and never had Don
bagged anything bigger than a fox or a coon

Where did you see him

I didnt see him Don looked disgusted But he was in our house last
night

Look here now stop that said Don gripping Hughie by the jacket and
shaking him

But Hughies summer in the harvestfield had built up his muscles and
so he shook himself free from Dons grasp and said Look out there
Im telling you the truth Last night father was out late and the supper
things were left on the tablesome honey and stuffand after father
had been asleep for a while he was wakened by some one tramping about
the house He got up came out of his room and called out Jessie
where are the matches And just then there was an awful crash and
something hairy brushed past his leg in the dark and got out of the
door We all came down and there was the table upset the dishes all on
the floor and four great big deep scratches in the table

Pshaw It must have been Fido

Fido was in the barn and just mad to get out and besides the tracks
are there yet behind the house It was a bear sure enough and Im
going after him

You

Yes and I want you to come with the dogs

Oh pshaw Dear knows where hell be now said Don considering

Like enough in the Big Swamp or in McLeods beech bush Theyre awful
fond of beechnuts But the dogs can track him cant they

By jingo Id like to get him said Don kindling under Hughies
excitement Wait a bit now Dont say a word If Murdie hears hell
want to come sure and we dont want him You wait here till I get the
gun and the dogs

Have you got any bullets or slugs

Yes lots Why Have you a gun

Yes you just bet Ive got our gun What did you think I was going to
do Put salt on his tail Ive got it down the lane

All right you wait there for me

Dont be long said Hughie slipping away

It was half an hour before Don appeared with the gun and the dogs

What in the world kept you I thought you were never coming said
Hughie impatiently

I tell you its no easy thing to get away with mother on hand but its
all right Heres your bullets and slugs Ive brought some bannocks and
cheese We dont know when well get home Well pick up the track in
your brule Does any one know youre going

No only Fusie He wanted to come but I wouldnt have it Fusie gets
so excited Hughies calmness was not phenomenal He could hardly stand
still for two consecutive seconds

Well lets go and Don set off on a trot with one of the black dogs
in leash and the other following and after him came Hughie running
lightly

In twenty minutes they were at the manse clearing

Now said Don pulling up where did you say you saw his track

Just back of the house there and round the barn and then straight for
the brule

The boys stood looking across the fallen timber toward the barn

Theres Fido barking said Hughie I bet hes on the scent now

Yes answered Don and theres your father too

Gimmini crickets so it is said Hughie slowly I dont think its
worth while going up there to get that track Cant we get it just as
well in the woods here There were always things to do about the house
and besides the minister knew nothing of Hughies familiarity with the
gun and hence would soon have put a stop to any such rash venture as
bearhunting

The boys waited listening to Fido who was running back and forward
between the brule and the house barking furiously The minister seemed
interested in Fidos manoeuvres and followed him a little way

Man said Hughie in a whisper perhaps hell go and look for the gun
himself And Fido will find us sure I say lets go

Lets wait a minute said Don to see what direction Fido takes and
then well put our dogs on

In a few minutes Hughie breathed more freely for his father seemed to
lose his interest in Fido and returned slowly to the house

Now said Hughie lets get down into the brule as near Fido as we
can get

Cautiously the boys made their way through the fallen timber keeping as
much as possible under cover of the underbrush But though they hunted
about for some time the dogs evidently got no scent for they remained
quite uninterested in the proceedings

Well have to get up closer to where Fido is said Don and the
sooner we get there the better

I suppose so said Hughie I suppose I had better go Fido will
stop barking for me So while Don lay hid with the dogs in the brule
Hughie stole nearer and nearer to Fido who was still chasing down
toward the brule and back to the house as if urging some one to come
forth and investigate the strange scent he had discovered Gradually
Hughie worked his way closer to Fido until within calling distance

Just as he was about to whistle for the dog the back door opened and
forth came the minister again By this time Fido had passed into the
brule a little way and could not be seen from the house It was an
anxious moment for Hughie He made a sudden desperate resolve He must
secure Fido now or else give up the chance of getting on the trail of
the bear So he left his place of hiding and bending low ran swiftly
forward until Fido caught sight of him and hearing his voice came to
him barking loudly and making every demonstration of excitement and
joy He seized the dog by the collar and dragged him down and after
holding him quiet for a moment hauled him back to Don

Well have to take him with us he said Ill put this string on his
collar and hell go all right And to this Don agreed though very
unwillingly for he had no confidence in Fidos hunting ability

I tell you hes a great fighter said Hughie if we should ever get
near that bear

Oh pshaw said Don he may fight dogs well enough but when it comes
to a bear its a different thing Every dog is scared of a bear the
first time he sees him

Well I bet you Fido wont run from anything said Hughie
confidently

To their great relief they saw the minister set off in the opposite
direction across the fields

Thank goodness Hes off to the McRaes said Hughie

Now then said Don well go back to the track there and put the
dogs on You go on with Fido And Hughie set off with Fido pulling
eagerly upon the string

When they reached the spot where Fido had been seized by Hughie
suddenly the black dog who had been following Don at some distance
stopped short and began to growl In a moment his mate threw up his nose
and began sniffing about the hair rising stiff upon his back

Hes catching it said Don in an excited tone Here you hold him I
must get the other one or hell be off He was not a minute too soon
for the other dog who had been ranging about suddenly found the trail
and with a fierce short bark was about to dash off when Don threw
himself upon him In a few moments both dogs were on the leash and set
off upon the scent at a great pace The trail was evidently plain enough
to the dogs for they followed hard leading the boys deeper and deeper
into the bush

Hes making for the Big Swamp said Don and on they went with eyes
and ears on the alert expecting every moment to hear the snort of a
bear or to meet him on the further side of every bunch of underbrush

For an hour they went on at a steady trot over and under fallen logs
splashing through water holes crashing over dead brushwood and tearing
through the interlacing boughs of the thick underbrush of spruce and
balsam The black dogs never hesitated They knew well what was their
business there and that they kept strictly in mind Fido on the other
hand who loved to roam the woods in an aimless hunt for any and every
wild thing that might cross his nose but who never had seriously hunted
anything in particular trotted goodnaturedly behind Hughie with rather
a bored expression on his face

The trail which had led them steadily north all at once turned west
and away from the swamp

Say said Don hes making for Alan Gorrachs cabin

Man said Hughie that would be fine to get him there Its good and
open too

Too open by a long way grunted Don Wed never get him there

Sure enough the dogs led up from the swamp and along the path to Alans
cabin The door stood open and in answer to Dons Horo Alan came
out

What now he said glowering at Don

You wont be wanting any dogs today Alan said Don politely

Alan glanced at him suspiciously but said not a word

These are very good dogs indeed Alan

Go on your ways now said Alan

These black ones are not in very good condition but Fido there is a
good fat dog

Alans wrath began to rise

Will you be going on now about your business

Better take them Alan theres a hard winter coming on

Mac an Diabhoil cried Alan in a shrill voice suddenly bursting
into fury I will be having your hearts blood he cried rushing into
his cabin

Come on Hughie cried Don and away they rushed following the black
dogs upon the trail of the bear

Deeper and deeper into the swamp the dogs led the way the going
becoming more difficult and the underbrush thicker at every step After
an hour or two of hard work the dogs began to falter and ran hither
and thither now on one scent and then on another till tired out and
disgusted Don held them in and threw himself down upon the soft moss
that lay deep over everything

Were on his old tracks here said Don savagely and you cant pick
out the new from the old

His hole must be somewhere not too far away said Hughie

Yes perhaps it is but then again it may be across the ridge At any
rate well have some grub

As they ate the bannocks and cheese they pictured to themselves what
they should do if they ever should come up with the bear

One thing weve got to be careful of said Don and that is not to
lose our heads

Thats so assented Hughie feeling quite cool and selfpossessed at
the time

Because if you lose your head youre done for continued Don
Remember Ken McGregor

No said Hughie

Didnt you ever hear that Why he ran into a bear and made a drive at
him with his axe but the bear with one paw knocked the axe clear out
of his hand and with one sweep of the other tore his insides right out
Theyre mighty cute too went on Don Theyll pretend to be almost
dead just to coax you near enough and then theyll spin round on their
hind legs like a rooster If they ever do catch you the only thing
to do is to lie still and make believe youre dead and then unless
theyre very hungry they wont hurt you much

After half an hours rest the hunting instinct awoke again within them
and the boys determined to make another attempt After circling about
the swamp for some time the boys came upon a beaten track which led
straight through the heart of the swamp

I say said Don this is going to strike the ridge somewhere just
about there pointing northeast and if we dont see anything between
here and the ridge well strike home that way Itll be better walking
than this cursed swamp anyway Are you tired

Hughie refused to acknowledge any weariness

Well then I am said Don

The trail was clear enough and they were able to follow at a good
pace so that in a few minutes as they had expected they struck the
northeast end of the swamp Here again they called a halt and tying
up the dogs lay down upon the dry brown leaves lazily eating the
beechnuts and discussing their prospects of meeting the bear and their
plans for dealing with him

Well lets go on at length said Don Theres just a chance of our
meeting him on this ridge Hes got a den somewhere down in the swamp
and he may be coming home this way Besides itll take us all our time
now to get home before dark I guess theres no use keeping the dogs
any longer Well just let them go So saying Don let the black dogs
go free but after a little skirmishing through the open beech woods
the dogs appeared to lose all interest in the expedition and kept close
to Dons heels

Fido on the other hand followed ranging the woods on either side
cheerfully interested in scaring up rabbits groundhogs and squirrels
He had never known the rapture of bringing down big game and so was
content with whatever came his way

At length the hunters reached the main trail where their paths
separated but a little of the swamp still remained and on the other
side was the open clearing

This is your best way said Don pointing out the path to Hughie We
had bad luck today but well try again We may meet him still you
know so dont fire at any squirrel or anything If I hear a shot Ill
come to you and you do the same by me

I say said Hughie where does this track of mine come out Is it
below the Deepole there or is it on the other side of the clearing

Why dont you know said Don This runs right up to the back of the
Fishers berry patch and through the sugarbush to your own clearing
Ill go with you if you like

Oh pshaw said Hughie Ill find it all right Come on Fido But
Fido had disappeared Good night Don

Good night said Don Mind you dont fire unless its at a bear Ill
do the same

In a few minutes Hughie found himself alone in the thick underbrush of
the swamp The shadows were lying heavy and the sunlight that still
caught the tops of the tall trees was quite lost in the gloom of the low
underbrush Deep moss under foot with fallen trees and thickgrowing
balsam and cedars made the walking difficult and every step Hughie
wished himself out in the clearing He began to feel too the
oppression of the falling darkness He tried whistling to keep up his
courage but the sound seemed to fill the whole woods about him and he
soon gave it up

After a few minutes he stood still and called for Fido but the dog had
gone on some hunt of his own and with a sense of deeper loneliness
he set himself again to his struggle with the moss and brush and fallen
trees At length he reached firmer ground and began with more cheerful
heart to climb up to the open

Suddenly he heard a rustle and saw the brush in front of him move

Oh there you are you brute he cried come in here Come in Fido
Here sir

He pushed the bushes aside and his heart jumped and filled his mouth
A huge black shape stood right across his path not ten paces away A
moment they gazed at each other and then with a low growl the bear
began to sway awkwardly toward him Hughie threw up his gun and fired
The bear paused snapping viciously and tearing at his wounded shoulder
and then rushed on Hughie without waiting to rise on his hind legs

Like a flash Hughie dodged behind the brush and then fled like the wind
toward the open Looking over his shoulder he saw the bear shambling
after him at a great pace and gaining at every jump and his heart
froze with terror The balsams and spruces were all too low for safety
A little way before him he saw a small birch If he could only make that
he might escape Summoning all his strength he rushed for the tree
the bear closing fast upon him Could he spring up out of reach of the
bears awful claws

Two yards from the tree he heard an angry snap and snarl at his heels
With a cry he dropped his gun and springing for the lowest bough drew
up his legs quickly after him with the horrible feeling of having
them ripped asunder To his amazement he found that the bear was not
scrambling up the tree after him but was still some paces off with
Fido skirmishing at long range It was Fidos timely nip that had
brought him to a sudden halt and allowed Hughie to make his climb in
safety

Good dog Fido Sic him Sic him old fellow cried out Hughie but
Fido was new to this kind of warfare and at every jump of the raging
brute he fled into the brush with his tail between his legs returning
however to the attack as the bear retired

After driving Fido off the bear rushed at the tree and in a fury began
tearing up its roots Then as if realizing the futility of this he
flung himself upon its trunk and began shaking it with great violence
from side to side

Hughie soon saw that the tree would not long stand such an attack He
slipped down to the lowest bough so that his weight might be taken from
the swaying top and encouraging Fido awaited results

He found himself singularly cool Having escaped immediate danger the
hunters instinct awoke within him and he longed to get that bear
If he only had his gun he would soon settle him but the bear
unfortunately had possession of that He began hurriedly to cut off as
stout a branch as he could to make himself a club He was not a moment
too soon for the bear realizing that he could neither tear up the tree
by the roots nor shake his enemy out of it decided apparently to go
up for him

He first set himself to get rid of Fido which he partially succeeded
in doing by chasing him a long distance off Then with a great rush he
flew at the tree and with amazing rapidity began to climb

Hughie surprised by this swift attack hastened to climb to the higher
branches but in a moment he saw that this would be fatal Remembering
that the bear is like the dog in his sensitive parts he descended to
meet his advancing foe and reaching down hit him a sharp blow on
the snout With a roar of rage and surprise the bear let go his
hold slipped to the ground and began to tear up the earth sneezing
violently

Oh if I only had that gun groaned Hughie Id get him And if he
gets away after Fido again I believe Ill try it

The bear now set himself to plan some new form of attack He had been
wounded but only enough to enrage him and his fury served to fix more
firmly in his head the single purpose of getting into his grip this
enemy of his in the tree whom he appeared to have so nearly at his
mercy

Whatever his new plan might be a necessary preliminary was getting rid
of Fido and this he proceeded to do Round about the trees he pursued
him getting farther and farther away from the birch till Hughie
watching his chance slipped down the tree and ran for his gun But no
sooner had he stooped for it than the bear saw the move and with an
angry roar rushed for him

Once more Hughie sprang for his branch but the gun caught in the boughs
and he slipped to the ground the bear within striking distance With a
cry he sprang again reached his bough and drew himself up holding his
precious gun safe wondering how he had escaped Again it was Fido that
had saved him for as the bear had gathered himself to spring Fido
seeing his chance rushed boldly in and flinging himself upon the hind
leg of the enraged brute held fast It was the boys salvation but
alas it was Fidos destruction for wheeling suddenly the bear struck
a swift downward blow with his powerful front paw and tore the whole
side of the faithful brute wide open With a howl poor Fido dragged
himself away out of reach and lay down moaning pitifully

The bear realizing that he had got rid of one foe now proceeded more
cautiously to deal with the other and began warily climbing the tree
keeping his wicked little eyes fixed upon Hughie

Meantime Hughie was loading his gun with all speed He emptied his
powderhorn into the muzzle and with the bear coming slowly nearer
began to search for his bullets Through one pocket after another his
trembling fingers flew while with the butt of his gun he menaced his
approaching enemy

Where are those bullets he groaned Ah here they are diving into
his trousers pocket Fool of a place to keep them too

He took a handful of slugs and bullets poured them into his gun rammed
down a wadding of leaves upon all retreating as he did so to the higher
limbs the bear following him steadily But just as he had his cap
securely fixed upon the nipple the bear suddenly revealed his plan
Holding by his front paws he threw his hind legs off from the trunk It
was his usual method of felling trees The tree swayed and bent till the
top almost touched the ground But Hughie with his legs wreathed round
the trunk brought his gun to his shoulder and with its muzzle almost
touching the breast of the hanging brute pulled the trigger

There was a terrific report the bear dropped in a heap from the tree
and Hughie was hurled violently to the ground some distance away
partially stunned He raised himself to see the bear struggle up to a
sitting position and gnashing his teeth and flinging blood and foam
from his mouth begin to drag himself toward him He was conscious of
a languid indifference and found himself wondering how long the bear
would take to cover the distance

But while he was thus cogitating there was a sharp quick bark and a
great black form hurled itself at the bears throat and bore the fierce
brute to the ground

Drawing a long sigh Hughie sank back to the ground with the sound of a
faraway shot in his ears and darkness veiling his eyes

He was awakened by Dons voice anxiously calling him

Are you hurt much Hughie Did he squeeze you

Hughie sat up blinking stupidly

What he asked Who

Why the bear of course

The bear No Man Its too bad you werent here Don he went on
rousing himself He cant be gone far

Not very said Don laughing loud Yonder he lies

Hughie turned his head and gazed wondering at the great black mass
over which Dons black dogs were standing guard and sniffing with
supreme satisfaction

Then all came back to him

Wheres Fido he asked rising Yes it was Fido saved me for sure
He tackled the bear every time he rushed at me and hung onto him just
as I climbed the tree the second time

As he spoke he walked over to the place where he had last seen the
dog A little farther on behind a sprucetree they found poor Fido
horribly mangled and dead

Hughie stooped down over him Poor old boy poor old Fido he said in
a low voice stroking his head

Don turned away and walked whistling toward the bear As he sat beside
the black carcass his two dogs came to him He threw his arms round
them saying Poor old Blackie Poor Nigger and he understood how
Hughie was feeling behind the sprucetree beside the faithful dog that
had given him his life

As he sat there waiting for Hughie he heard voices

Horo he shouted

Where are you Is that you Don It was his fathers voice

Yes here we are

Is Hughie there inquired another voice

Losh me thats the minister said Don Yes all right he cried
aloud as up came Long John Cameron and the minister with Fusie and a
stranger bringing up the rear

Fine work this Youre fine fellows indeed cried Long John
frightening people in this way

Where is Hughie said the minister sternly

Hughie came from behind the brush hurriedly wiping his eyes Here
father he said

And what are you doing here at this hour of the night pray said the
minister angrily turning toward him

I couldnt get home very well replied Hughie

And why not pray Dont begin any excuses with me sir Nothing
annoyed the minister as an attempt to excuse illdoing

I guess he would have been glad enough to have got home half an hour
ago sir broke in Don laughing Look there He pointed to the bear
lying dead with Nigger standing over him

The Lord save us said Long John Cameron himself the greatest among
the hunters of the county What do you say And how did you get him
Jeerupiter hes a grand one

The old man the minister and Don walked about the bear in admiring
procession

Yons a terrible gash said Long John pointing to a gaping wound in
the breast Was that your Snider Don

Not a bit of it father The bears Hughies He killed him himself

Losh me And you dont tell me And how did you manage that Hughie

He chased me up that tree and I guess would have got me only for
Fido

The minister gasped

Got you Was he as near as that

He wasnt three feet away said Hughie and with that he proceeded to
give in his most graphic style a description of his great fight with
the bear

When I heard the first shot said Don I was away across the swamp
I tell you I tore back here and when I came what did I see but Hughie
and Mr Bear both sitting down and looking coolly at each other a few
yards apart And then Nigger downed him and I put a bullet into his
heart Don was greatly delighted and extremely proud of Hughies
achievement

And how did you know about it asked Don of his father

It was the minister here came after me

Yes said the minister it was Fusie told me you had gone off on a
bear hunt and so I went along to the Camerons with Mr Craven here to
see if you had got home

Meantime Mr Craven had been looking Hughie over

Mighty plucky thing he said Great nerve and he lapsed into
silence while Fusie could not contain himself but danced from one foot
to the other with excited exclamations

The minister had come out intending as he said to teach that boy a
lesson that he would remember but as he listened to Hughies story
his anger gave place to a great thankfulness

It was a great mercy my boy he said at length when he was quite
sure of his voice that you had Fido with you

Yes indeed father said Hughie It was Fido saved me

It was the Lords goodness said the minister solemnly

And a great mercy said Long John that your lad kept his head and
showed such courage You have reason to be proud of him

The minister said nothing just then but at home when recounting the
exploit to the mother he could hardly contain his pride in his son

Never thought the boy would have a nerve like that hes so excitable
I had rather he killed that bear than win a medal at the university

The mother sat silent through all the story her cheek growing more and
more pale but not a word did she say until the tale was done and then
she said Who delivereth thee from destruction

A little like David mother wasnt it said Hughie but though there
was a smile on his face his manner and tone were earnest enough

Yes said his mother a good deal like David for it was the same God
that delivered you both

Rather hard to cut Fido out of his share of the glory said Mr
Craven not to speak of a cool head and a steady nerve

Mrs Murray regarded him for a moment or two in silence as if
meditating an answer but finally she only said We shall cut no one
out of the glory due to him

At the suppertable the whole affair was discussed in all its bearings
In this discussion Hughie took little part making light of his exploit
and giving most of the credit to Fido and the mother wondered at the
unusual reserve and gravity that had fallen upon her boy Indeed Hughie
was wondering at himself He had a strange new feeling in his heart
He had done a mans deed and for the first time in his life he felt it
unnecessary to glory in his deeds He had come to a new experience that
great deeds need no voice to proclaim them During the thrilling moments
of that terrible hour he had entered the borderland of manhood and the
awe of that new world was now upon his spirit

It was chiefly this new experience of his that was sobering him but it
helped him not a little to check his wonted boyish exuberance that
at the table opposite him sat a strange young man across whose dark
magnetic face there flitted now and then a lazy cynical smile
Hughie feared that lazy smile and he felt that it would shrivel into
selfcontempt any feeling of boastfulness

The mother and Hughie said little to each other waiting to be alone
and after Hughie had gone to his room his mother talked long with him
but when Mr Craven on his way to bed heard the low quiet tones of
the mothers voice through the shut door he knew it was not to Hughie
she was speaking and the smile upon his face lost a little of its
cynicism

Next day there was no smile when he stood with Hughie under the
birchtree watching the lad hew flat one side but gravely enough he
took the paper on which Hughie had written Fido Sept 13th 18
saying as he did so I shall cut this for you It is good to remember
brave deeds



CHAPTER XI

JOHN CRAVENS METHOD


Mr John Craven could not be said to take his schoolteaching seriously
and indeed any one looking at his face would hardly expect him to take
anything seriously and certainly those who in his college days followed
and courted and kept pace with Jack Craven and knew his smile would
have expected from him anything other than seriousness He appeared
to himself to be enacting a kind of grim comedy exile as he was in a
foreign land among people of a strange tongue

He knew absolutely nothing of pedagogical method and consequently he
ignored all rules and precedents in the teaching and conduct of the
school His discipline was of a most fantastic kind He had a feeling
that all lessons were a bore therefore he would assign the shortest and
easiest of tasks But having assigned the tasks he expected perfection
in recitation and impressed his pupils with the idea that nothing less
would pass His ideas of order were of the loosest kind and hence the
noise at times was such that even the older pupils found it unbearable
but when the hour for recitation came somehow a deathlike stillness
fell upon the school and the unready shivered with dread apprehension
And yet he never thrashed the boys but his fear lay upon them for his
eyes held the delinquent with such an intensity of magnetic penetrating
power that the unhappy wretch felt as if any kind of calamity might
befall him

When one looked at John Cravens face it was the eyes that caught and
held the attention They were black without either gleam or glitter
indeed almost dulla lady once called them smoky eyes They looked
under lazy halfdrooping lids like things asleep except in moments
of passion when there appeared far down a glowing fire red and
terrible At such moments it seemed as if looking through these one
were catching sight of a soul ablaze They were like the dull glow of a
furnace through an inky night

He was constitutionally and habitually lazy but in a reading lesson he
would rouse himself at times and by his utterance of a single line
make the whole school sit erect Friday afternoon he gave up to what he
called the cultivation of the finer arts On that afternoon he would
bring his violin and teach the children singing hear them read and
recite and read for them himself and no greater punishment could be
imposed upon the school than the loss of this afternoon

Man alive Thomas hes mighty queer Hughie explained to his friend
When he sits there with his feet on the stove smoking away and reading
something or other and letting them all gabble like a lot of ducks
it just makes me mad But when he wakes up he puts the fear of death on
you and when he reads he makes you shiver through and through You know
that long rigmarole Friends Romans countrymen I used to hate
it Well sir he told us about it last Friday You know on Friday
afternoons we dont do any work but just have songs and reading and
that sort of thing Well sir last Friday he told us about the big row
in Rome and how Caesar was murdered and then he read that thing to
us By gimmini whack it made me hot and cold I could hardly keep from
yelling and every one was white And then he read that other thing you
know about Little Nell Used to make me sick but my goodness alive
do you know before he got through the girls were wiping their eyes and
I was almost as bad and you could have heard a pin drop Hes mighty
queer though lazy as the mischief and always smiling and smiling and
yet you dont feel like smiling back

Do you like him asked Thomas bluntly

Dunno Id like to but he wont let you somehow Just smiles at you
and you feel kind of small

The reports about the master were conflicting and disquieting and
although Hughie was himself doubtful he stood up vehemently for him at
home

But Hughie protested the minister discussing these reports I am
told that he actually smokes in school

Hughie was silent

Answer me Does he smoke in school hours

Well confessed Hughie reluctantly he does sometimes but only
after he gives us all our work to do

Smoke in school hours ejaculated Mrs Murray horrified

Well whats the harm in that Father smokes

But he doesnt smoke when he is preaching said the mother

No but he smokes right afterwards

But not in church

Well perhaps not in church but schools different And anyway he
makes them read better and write better too said Hughie stoutly

Certainly said his father he is a most remarkable man A most
unusual man

What about your sums Hughie asked his mother

Dont know He doesnt bother much with that sort of thing and Im
just as glad

You ought really to speak to him about it said Mrs Murray after
Hughie had left the room

Well my dear said the minister smiling you heard what Hughie
said It would be rather awkward for me to speak to him about smoking I
think perhaps you had better do it

I am afraid said his wife with a slight laugh it would be just as
awkward for me I wonder what those Friday afternoons of his mean she
continued

I am sure I dont know but everywhere throughout the section I hear
the children speak of them Well just drop in and see I ought to visit
the school you know very soon

And so they did The master was surprised and for a moment appeared
uncertain what to do He offered to put the classes through their
regular lessons but at once there was a noisy outcry against this on
the part of the school which however was effectually and immediately
quelled by the quiet suggestion on the masters part that anything but
perfect order would be fatal to the programme And upon the minister
requesting that the usual exercises proceed the master smilingly
agreed

We make Friday afternoons he said at once a kind of reward day for
good work during the week and an opportunity for the cultivation of
some of the finer arts

And certainly he was a master in this business He had strong dramatic
instincts and a remarkable power to stimulate and draw forth the
emotions

When the programme of singing recitations and violinplaying was
finished there were insistent calls on every side for Mark Antony It
appeared to be the piece de resistance in the minds of the children

What does this mean inquired the minister as the master stood
smiling at his pupils

Oh they are demanding a little high tragedy he said which I
sometimes give them It assists in their reading lessons he explained
apologetically and with that he gave them what Hughie called that
rigmarole beginning Friends Romans countrymen Mark Antonys
immortal oration

Well said the minister as they drove away from the school what do
you think of that now

Marvelous exclaimed his wife What dramatic power what insight
what interpretation

You may say so exclaimed her husband What an actor he would make

Yes said his wife or what a minister he would make I understand
now his wonderful influence over Hughie and I am afraid

O he cant do Hughie any harm with things like that replied her
husband emphatically

No but Hughie now and then repeats some of his sayings aboutabout
religion and religious convictions that I dont like And then he is
hanging about that Twentieth store altogether too much and I fancied
I noticed something strange about him last Friday evening when he came
home so late

O nonsense said the minister His reputation has prejudiced you
and that is not fair and your imagination does the rest

Well it is a great pity that he should not do something with himself
replied his wife There are great possibilities in that young man

He does not take himself seriously enough said her husband That is
the chief trouble with him

And this was apparently Jack Cravens opinion of himself as is evident
from his letter to his college friend Ned Maitland


Dear Ned

For the last two months I have been seeking to adjust myself to my
surroundings and find it no easy business I have struck the land
of the Anakim for the inhabitants are all of tremenjous size and
indeed tremenjous in all their ways more particularly in their
religion Religion is all over the place You are liable to come upon a
boy anywhere perched on a fence corner with a New Testament in his hand
and on Sunday the tremenjousness of their religion is overwhelming
Every other interest in life as meat drink and dress are purely
incidental to the main business of the day which is the delivering
hearing and discussing of sermons

The padre at whose house I am very happily quartered is a
tremenjous preacher He has visions and gives them to me He gives
me chills and thrills as well and has discovered to me a conscience a
portion of my anatomy that I had no suspicion of possessing

The congregation is like the preacher They will sit for two hours
and after a break of a few minutes they will sit again for two hours
listening to sermons and even the interval is somewhat evenly divided
between their bread and cheese in the churchyard and the discussion of
the sermon they have just listened to They are great on theology One
worthy old party tackled me on my views of the sermon we had just heard
after a little preliminary sparring I went to my corner I often wonder
in what continent I am

The school a primitive little log affair has much run to seed but
offers opportunity for repose I shall avoid any unnecessary excitement
in this connection

In private life the padre is really very decent We have great smokes
together and talks On all subjects he has very decided opinions and
in everything but religion liberal views I lure him into philosophic
discussions and overwhelm him with my newest and biggest metaphysical
terms which always reduce his enormous cocksureness to more reasonable
dimensions

The ministers wife is quite another proposition She argues too
but unfortunately she asks questions in the meekest way possible
acknowledging her ignorance of my big terms and insisting upon
definitions and exact meanings and then its all over with me How
she ever came to this far land heaven knows and none but heaven can
explain such waste Having no kindred soul to talk with I fancy she
enjoys conversation with myself sic revels in music is transported
to the fifth heaven by my performance on the violin but evidently
pities me and regards me as dangerous But my dear Maitland after
a somewhat wide and varied experience of fine ladies I give you my
verdict that here among the Anakim and in this wild woody land is
a lady fine and fair and saintly She will bother me I know Her son
Hughie he of the bear of whom I told you the lad with the face of
an angel and the temper of an angel but of a different colorher son
Hughie she must make into a scholar And no wonder for already he has
attained a remarkable degree of excellence by the grace not of the
little log school however I venture to shy His mother has been at
him But now she feels that something more is needed and for that
she turns to me You will be able to see the humor of it but not the
pathos She wants to make a man out of her boy a noble purehearted
gentleman and this she lays upon me Did I hear you laugh Smile not
it is the most tragic of pathos Upon me Jack Craven the despair of
the professors the terror of the watch thealas you know only too
well My tongue clave to the roof of my mouth and before I could cry
Heaven forbid that I should have a hand in the making of your boy
she accepted my pledge to do her desire for her young angel with the
OTHERangelic temper

And now my dear Ned is it for my sins that I am thus pursued What
is awaiting me I know not What I shall do with the young cub I have
not the ghostliest shadow of an idea Shall I begin by thrashing him
soundly I have refrained so far I hate the role of executioner Or
shall I teach him boxing The gloves are a great educator and are at
times what the padre would call means of grace

But what will become of me Shall I become prematurely aged or shall I
become a saint Expect anything from your most devoted but most sorely
bored and perplexed

CHAPTER XII

THE DOWNFALL


In one point the master was a great disappointment to Hughie he could
not be persuaded to play shinny The usual challenge had come up from
the Front with its more than usual insolence and Hughie who now
ranked himself among the big boys felt the shame and humiliation to be
intolerable By the most strenuous exertions he started the game
going with the first fall of snow but it was difficult to work up
any enthusiasm for the game in the face of Foxys very determined and
weighty opposition backed by the masters lazy indifference For
in spite of Hughies contempt and open sneers Foxy had determined to
reopen his store with new and glowing attractions He seemed to have a
larger command of capital than ever and he added several very important
departments to his financial undertaking

The rivalry between Hughie and Foxy had become acute but besides this
there was in Hughies heart a pentup fierceness and longing for revenge
that he could with difficulty control And though he felt pretty certain
that in an encounter with Foxy he would come off second best and though
in consequence he delayed that encounter as long as possible he never
let Foxy suspect his fear of him and waited with some anxiety for the
inevitable crisis

Upon one thing Hughie was resolved that the challenge from the Front
should be accepted and that they should no longer bear the taunt of
cowardice but should make a try even though it meant certain defeat

His first step had been the organization of the shinny club His next
step was to awaken the interest of the master But in vain he enlarged
upon the boastfulness and insolence of the Front in vain he recounted
the achievements of their heroes of old who in those brave days had won
victory and fame over all comers for their school and county the master
would not be roused to anything more than a languid interest in the
game And this was hardly to be wondered at for shinny in the snow upon
the roadway in front of the school was none too exciting But from
the day when the game was transferred to the millpond one Saturday
afternoon when the North and South met in battle the masters
indifference vanished for it turned out that he was an enthusiastic
skater and as Hughie said a whirlwind on the ice

After that day shinny was played only upon the ice and the master
assuming the position of coach instituted a more scientific style of
game and worked out a system of combined play that made even small
boys dangerous opponents to boys twice their size and weight Under his
guidance it was that the challenge to the Front was so worded as to
make the contest a game on ice and to limit the number of the team to
eleven Formerly the number had been somewhat indefinite varying from
fifteen to twenty and the style of play a general melee Hughie was
made captain of the shinny team and set himself under the masters
direction to perfect their combination and team play

The masters unexpected interest in the shinny game was the first and
chief cause of Foxys downfall as leader of the school and if Hughie
had possessed his soul in patience he might have enjoyed the
spectacle of Foxys overthrow without involving himself in the painful
consequences which his thirst for vengeance and his vehement desire to
accomplish Foxys ruin brought upon him

The story of the culmination of the rivalry between Hughie and Foxy is
preserved in John Cravens second letter to his friend Edward Maitland
The letter also gives an account of the masters own undoingan undoing
which bore fruit to the end of his life


Dear Ned

I hasten to correct the false impression my previous letter must have
conveyed to you It occurs to me that I suggested that this school
afforded unrivaled opportunities for repose Further acquaintance
reveals to me the fact that it is the seething center of the most
nerveracking excitement The life of the school is reflected in the
life of the community and the throbs of excitement that vibrate from
the school are felt in every home of the section We are in the thick
of preparations for a deadly contest with the insolent benighted
boastful but hitherto triumphant Front in the matter of shinny You
know my antipathy to violent sports and you will find some difficulty
in picturing me an enthusiastic trainer and general director of the
Twentieth team flying about wildly gesticulating with a club and
shrieking orders imprecations cautions encouragements in the most
frantic manner at as furious a company of little devils as ever went
joyously to battle

Then as if this were not excitement enough I am made the unwitting
spectator of a truly Homeric contest bloodier by far than many of those
fought on the plains of windy Troy between the rival leaders of the
school to wit Hughie of the angelic face and OTHERangelic temper and
an older and much heavier boy who rejoices in the cognomen of Foxy
as being accurately descriptive at once of the brilliance of his foliage
and of his financial tactics

It appears that for many months this rivalry has existed but I
am convinced that there is more in the struggle than appears on the
surface There is some dark and deadly mystery behind it all that only
adds of course to the thrilling interest it holds for me

Long before I arrived on the arena which was an open space in the
woods in front of what Foxy calls his store wild shrieks and yells fell
upon my ears as if the aboriginal denizens of the forest had returned
Quietly approaching I soon guessed the nature of the excitement and
being unwilling to interfere until I had thoroughly grasped the ethical
and other import of the situation I shinned up a tree and from this
point of vantage took in the spectacle It appeared from Foxys violent
accusations that Hughie had been guilty of wrecking the store which
by the way the latter utterly despises and contemns The following
interesting and striking conversation took place

What are you doing in my store anyway says he of the brilliant
foliage Youre just a thief thats what you are and a sneaking
thief

Promptly the lie comes back I wasnt touching your rotten stuff and
again the lie is exchanged

Immediately there is demand from the spectators that the matter be
argued to a demonstration and thereupon one of the larger boys wishing
to precipitate matters and to furnish a casus belli puts a chip upon
Hughies shoulder and dares Foxy to knock it off But Hughie flings the
chip aside

Go away with yourself and your chip Im not going to fight for any
chip

Yells of derision Cowardy cowardy custard Give him a good
cuffing Foxy Hes afraid and so forth And indeed Hughie appears
none too anxious to prove his innocence and integrity upon the big and
solid body of his antagonist

Foxy much encouraged by the clamor of his friends deploys in force in
front of his foe shouting Come on you little thief

Im not a thief I didnt touch one of your things

Whether you touched my things or not youre a thief anyway and you
know you are You stole money and I know it and you know it yourself

To this Hughie strangely enough makes no reply wherein lies the
mystery But though he makes no reply he faces up boldly to Foxy and
offers battle This is evidently a surprise to Foxy who contents
himself with threats as to what he can do with his one hand tied behind
his back and what he will do in a minute while Hughie waits wasting
no strength upon words

Finally Foxy strides to his store door and apparently urged to frenzy
by the sight of the wreckage therein comes back and lands a sharp cuff
on his antagonists ear

It is all that is needed As if he had touched a spring Hughie flew
at him wildly inconsequently making a windmill of his arms But
fortunately he runs foul of one of Foxys big fists and falls back
with spouting nose Enthusiastic yells from Foxys following And Foxy
having done much better than he expected is encouraged to pursue his
advantage

Meantime the blood is being mopped off Hughies face with a snowball
his tears flowing equally with his blood

Wait till tomorrow urges Fusie his little French fidus Achates

Tomorrow yells Hughie suddenly No but now Ill kill the lying
sneaking whitefaced beast now or Ill die myself after which heroic
resolve he flings himself blood and tears upon the waiting Foxy and
this time with better result for Foxy waiting the attack with arms up
and eyes shut finds himself pummeled all over the face and after a few
moments of ineffectual resistance turns and in quite the Homeric way
seeks safety in flight followed by the furious and vengeful Achilles
and the jeering shouts of the bloodthirsty but disappointed rabble

As I have said the mystery behind it remains unsolved but Foxys
reign is at an end and with him goes the store for which I am devoutly
thankful

I would my tale ended here with the downfall of Foxy but my dear Ned
I have to record a sadder and more humiliating downfall than thatthe
abject and utter collapse of my noble self I have once more played
the fool and played into the hands of the devil mine own familiar and
wellbeloved devil

The occasion I need not enlarge upon it always waits A long days
skate a late supper with some of the wilder and more reckless outcasts
of this steadygoing community that frequent the back store results in
my appearing at the manse door late at night very unsteady of leg and
incoherent of speech By a most unhappy chance a most scurvy trick
my familiar devil played upon me the door is opened by the ministers
wife I can see her look of fear horror and loathing yet It did
more to pull me together than a cold bath so that I saved myself the
humiliation of speech and escaped to my room

And now what do you think Reproaches objurgations and final
dismissal on the part of the padre tearful exhortations to repentance
on the part of his wife Not a bit If you believe me sir my unhappy
misadventure remains a secret with her She told not a soul Remarkably
fine I call that And what more think you A cold and haughty reserve
or a lofty pity with the fearful expectation of judgment Not in
the least Only a little added kindness a deeper note to the frank
sympathetic interest she has always shown and that is all My dear
chap I offered to leave but when she looked at me with those great
hazelbrown eyes of hers and said Why should you go Would it be
better for you any place else I found myself enjoying the luxury of
an entirely new set of emotions which I shall not analyze to you But
I feel more confident than ever that I shall either die early or end in
being a saint

And now do you know she persists in ignoring that anything has taken
place talks to me about her young men and her hopes for them the work
she would do for them and actually asks my assistance It appears that
ever since their Great Revival which is the beginning of days to them
events being dated from before the Great Revival or after some of
these young men have a desire to be ministers or think they have It is
really her desire I suspect for them The difficulty is preparation
for college In this she asks my help The enormous incongruity of
the situation does not appear to strike her that I thetoo many
unutterable thingsshould be asked to prepare these young giants with
their tremenjous religious convictions for the ministry nevertheless
I yield myself to do anything and everything she lays upon me I repeat
I shall without doubt end in being a saint myself and should not be
surprised to find myself with these tremenjous young men on the way
to Holy Orders Fancy the good Doctors face He would suspect a lurking
pleasantry in it all

This letter I know will render chaotic all your conceptions of me
and in this chaos of mind I can heartily sympathize What the next
chapter will be God only knows It depends upon how my familiar devil
behaves himself Meantime I am parleying with him and with some
anxiety as to the result subscribe myself

Your friend

CHAPTER XIII

THE FIRST ROUND


The challenge from the Front was for the best two out of three the
first game to be played the last day of the year Steadily under
Cravens coaching the Twentieth team were perfected in their systematic
play for although Craven knew nothing of shinny he had captained the
champion lacrosse team of the province of Quebec and the same general
rules of defense and attack could be applied with equal success to the
game of shinny The team was greatly strengthened by the accession of
Thomas Finch and Don Cameron both of whom took up the school again with
a view to college With Thomas in goal Hughie said he felt as if a big
hole had been filled up behind him

The master caused a few preliminary skirmishes with neighboring teams
to be played by way of practice and by the time the end of the year had
come he felt confident that the team would not disgrace their school
His confidence was not illfounded

We have covered ourselves with glory he writes to his friend Ned
Maitland for we have whipped to a finish the arrogant and mighty
Front I am more than ever convinced that I shall have to take a few
days off and get away to Montreal or some other retired spot to
recover from the excitement of the last week

Under my diligent coaching in which knowing nothing whatever of
shinny I have striven to introduce something of the lacrosse method
our team got into really decent fighting trim Under the leadership of
their captain who has succeeded in infusing his own fierce and furious
temper into his men they played like little demons from the drop of
the ball till the game was scored Furious is the word for they and
their captain play with headlong fury and that I might say is about
their only defect for if they ever should run into a bigger team who
had any semblance of head about them and were not merely feet they
would surely come to grief

I cannot stay to recount our victory Let it suffice that we were
driven down in two big sleighloads by Thomas Finch the back wall of
our defense and Don Cameron who plays in the right of the forward
line both great strapping fellows who are to be eventually I
believe members of my preparatory class

The Front came forth cheerful big confident trusting in the might
of their legs We are told that the Lord taketh no pleasure in the legs
of man and this is true in the game of shinny Not legs alone but
heart and head win with anything like equal chances

Game called 230 Captain Hughie has the drop seizes the ball passes
it to Fusie who rushes passes back to Hughie who has arrived in the
vicinity of the enemys goal and shoots swift and straight a goal
Time 30 seconds

Again and again my little demons pierce the heavy solid line of the
Front defense and score the enemy big and bewildered being chiefly
occupied in watching them do it By six oclock that evening I had them
safe at the manse in a condition of dazed jubilation quite unable to
realize the magnificence of their achievement They had driven twelve
miles down played a two hours game of shinny score eight to two
and were back safe and sound bearing with them victory and some broken
shins equally proud of both

There is a big supper at the manse prepared I believe with the view
of consolation but transformed into a feast of triumph the minister
being enthusiastically jubilant over the achievement of his boys his
wife if possible even more so The heroes feed themselves to fullness
amazing and complete the minister holds a thanksgiving service in
which I have no doubt my little demons most earnestly join after which
they depart to shed the radiance of their glory throughout the section

And now I have to recount another experience of mine quite unique and
altogether inexplicable It appears that in this remarkable abodeI
would call it The Saints Rest were it not for the presence of others
than saints and for the additional fact that there is little rest for
the saint who makes her dwelling herein this abode there prevails the
quaint custom of watching the death of the old year and the birth of the
new It is made the occasion of religious and heartsearching rite As
the solemn hour of midnight draws on a silence falls upon the family
all of whom with the exception of the newest infant are present It is
the family festival of the year

And what will they be doing at your home Mr Craven inquires the
minister The contrast that rose before my mind was vivid enough for
having received my invitation to a big dance I knew my sweet sisters
would be having a jolly wild time about that moment My answer given I
feel in a somewhat flippant tone appears to shock my shinny captain of
the angelic face who casts a honorstricken glance at his mother and
waits for the word of reproof that he thinks is due from the padres
lips

But before it falls the mother interposes with They will miss
you greatly this evening It was rather neatly done and I think I
appreciated it

The rite proceeds The initial ceremony is the repeating of a verse of
Scripture all round and to save my life nothing comes to my mind but
the words Remember Lots wife As I cannot see the appropriateness of
the quotation I pass

Five minutes before the stroke of twelve they sing the Scottish
paraphrase beginning O God of Bethel I do not suppose you ever heard
it but it is a beautiful hymn and singularly appropriate to the
hour In this I lend assistance with my violin the tune being the very
familiar one of Auld Lang Syne associated in my mind however with
occasions somewhat widely diverse from this I assure you I am thankful
that my part is instrumental for the whole business is getting onto my
emotions in a disturbing manner and especially when I allow my eyes to
linger for a moment or two on the face of the lady the center of the
circle who is deliberately throwing away her fine culture and her
altogether beautiful soul upon the Anakim here and with a beautiful
unconsciousness of anything like sacrifice is now thanking God for the
privilege of doing so I have some moments of rare emotional luxury
those moments that are next to tears

Then the padre offers one of those heartracking prayers of his that
whether they reach anything outside or not somehow get down into
ones vitals and stir up remorses and selfcondemnings and longings
unutterable Then they all kiss the mother and wish her a Happy
NewYear

My boy my dear boy I have never known deeper moments than those
And when I went to shake hands with her she seemed so like a queen
receiving homage that without seeming to feel I was making a fool
of myself I did the Queen Victoria act and saluted her hand It is
wonderful how great moments discover the lady to you She must have
known how I was feeling for with a very beautiful grace she said Let
me be your mother for tonight and by Jove she kissed me I have been
kissed before and have kissed some women in my time but that is the
only kiss I can remember and shelp me Bob Ill never kiss another
till I kiss my wife

And then and there Maitland I swore by all that I knew of God and by
everything sacred in life that Id quit the past and be worthy of her
trust for the mischief of it is she will persist in trusting you puts
you on your honor noblesse oblige business and all that I think I told
you that I might end in being a saint That dream I have surrendered
but by the grace of heaven Im going to try to be a man And I am
going to play shinny with those boys and if I can help them to win that
match and the big game of life I will do it

As witness my hand and seal this first day of January 18

CHAPTER XIV

THE FINAL ROUND


After the NewYear the school filled up with big boys some of whom had
returned with the idea of joining the preparatory class for college
which the minister had persuaded John Craven to organize

Shinny however became the absorbing interest for all the boys both
big and little This interest was intensified by the rumors that came up
from the Front for it was noised through the Twentieth section that Dan
Munro whose father was a cousin of Archie Munro the former teacher
had come from Marrintown and taken charge of the Front school and that
being used to the ice game and being full of tricks and swift as
a bird he was an exceedingly dangerous man More than that he was
training his team with his own tricks and had got back to school some
of the old players among whom were no less renowned personages than Hec
Ross and Jimmie Ben Jimmie Ben to wit James son of Benjamin McEwen
was more famed for his prowess as a fighter than for his knowledge
of the game of shinny but every one who saw him play said he was a
terror Further it was rumored that there was a chance of them
getting for goal Farquhar McRae Little Farquhar or Farquhar Bheg
pronounced vaick as he was euphoniously called who presumably had
once been little but could no longer claim to be so seeing that he was
six feet and weighed two hundred pounds

It behooved the Twentieth team therefore to bestir themselves with all
diligence and in this matter Hughie gave no rest either to himself or
to any one else likely to be of use in perfecting his team For Hughie
had been unanimously chosen captain in spite of his protests that the
master or one of the big boys should hold that place But none of the
big boys knew the new game as perfectly as Hughie and the master had
absolutely refused saying You beat them once Hughie and you can do
it again And as the days and weeks went on Hughie fully justified the
teams choice of him as captain He developed a genius for organization
a sureness of judgment and a tact in management as well as a skill and
speed in play that won the confidence of every member of his team He
set himself resolutely to banish any remaining relics of the ancient
style of play In the old game every one rushed to hit the ball without
regard to direction or distance and the consequence was that from end
to end of the field a mob of yelling stickwaving players more or less
aimlessly followed in the wake of the ball But Hughie and the master
changed all that forced the men to play in their positions training
them never to drive wildly forward but to pass to a man and to keep
their clubs down and their mouths shut

The striking characteristic of Hughies own playing was a certain
fierceness amounting almost to fury so that when he was in the attack
he played for every ounce there was in him His chief weakness lay in
his tempestuous temper which he found difficult to command but as he
worked his men from day to day and week to week the responsibility of
his position and the magnitude of the issues at stake helped him to a
selfcontrol quite remarkable in him

As the fateful day drew near the whole section was stirred with an
intense interest and excitement in which even the grave and solemn
elders shared and to a greater degree the minister and his wife

At length the day as all days great and small actually arrived A big
crowd awaited the appearance of the folks from the Front They were
expected about two but it was not till halfpast that there was heard
in the distance the sound of the bagpipes

Here they are Thats Alan the coopers pipes was the cry and
before long sure enough there appeared Alphonse le Roque driving his
FrenchCanadian team the joy and pride of his heart for Alphonse was
a born horsetrainer and had taught his FrenchCanadians many
extraordinary tricks On the dead gallop he approached the crowd till
within a few yards when at a sudden command they threw themselves
upon their haunches and came almost to a standstill With a crack of
his long whip Alphonse gave the command Deesplay yousef At once his
stout little team began to toss their beautiful heads and broke into
a series of prancing curves that would not have shamed a pair of
greyhounds Then as they drew up to the stoppingpoint he gathered
up his lines and with another crack of his whip cried Salute ze
ladies when with true equine courtesy they rose upon their hind legs
and gracefully pawed the empty air Finally after depositing his load
amid the admiring exclamations of the crowd he touched their tails with
the point of his whip gave a sudden Whish and like hounds from the
leash his horses sprang off at full gallop

One after another the teams from the Front swung round and emptied their
loads

Man what a crowd said Hughie to Don There must be a hundred at
least

Yes and theres Hec Ross and Jimmie Ben said Don and sure enough
Farquhar Begh Well be catching it today whatever continued Don
cheerfully

Pshaw we licked as big men before It isnt size said Hughie with
far more confidence than he felt

It was half an hour before the players were ready to begin The rules of
the game were few and simple The play was to be one hour each way
with a quarter of an hour rest between There was to be no tripping
no hitting on the shins when the ball was out of the scrimmage and all
disputes were to be settled by the umpire who on this occasion was the
master of the Sixteenth school

Hes no good grumbled Hughie to his mother who was even more excited
than her boy himself He cant play himself and hes too easy scared

Never mind said his mother brightly perhaps he wont have much to
do

Much to do Well theres Jimmie Ben and hes an awful fighter but
Im not going to let him frighten me said Hughie savagely and
theres Dan Munro too they say hes a terror and Hec Ross Of course
weve got just as good men but they wont fight Why Johnnie Big
Duncan and Don there are as good as any of them but they wont
fight

The mother smiled a little

What a pity But why should they fight Fighting is not shinny

No thats what the master says And hes right enough too but its
awful hard when a fellow doesnt play fair when he trips you up or
clubs you on the shins when youre not near the ball You feel like
hitting him back

Yes but thats the very time to show selfcontrol

I know And thats what the master says

Of course it is went on his mother Thats what the game is for to
teach the boys to command their tempers You remember he that ruleth
his spirit is better than he that taketh a city

O its all right said Hughie and easy enough to talk about

Whats easy enough to talk about asked the master coming up

Taking a city said Mrs Murray smiling at him

The master looked puzzled

Mother means said Hughie keeping ones temper in shinny But Im
telling her its pretty hard when a fellow clubs you on the shins when
youre away from the ball

Yes of course its hard said the master but its better than being
a cad which brought a quick flush to Hughies face but helped him
more than anything else to keep himself in hand that day

Cant understand a man said the master who goes into a game and
then quits it to fight If its fighting why fight but if its shinny
play the game Big team against us eh captain he continued looking
at the Front men who were taking a preliminary spin upon the ice and
pretty swift too

If they play fair I dont mind said Hughie Im not afraid of them
but if they get slugging

Well if they get slugging said the master well play the game and
win sure

Well its time to begin said Hughie and with a good by to his
mother he turned away

Remember take a city she called out after him

All right muzzie Ill remember

In a few moments the teams were in position opposite each other The
team from the Front made a formidable show in weight and muscle At the
right of the forward line stood the redoubtable Dan Munro the stocky
tricky fierce captain of the Front team and with him three rather
small boys in red shirts The defense consisted of Hec Ross the
muchfamed and muchfeared Jimmie Ben while in goal sure enough stood
the immense and solid bulk of Farquhar Bheg The center was held by four
boys of fair size and weight

In the Twentieth team the forward line was composed of Jack Ross Curly
Rosss brother Fusie Davie Scotch and Don Cameron The center was
played by Hughie with three little chaps who made up for their lack of
weight by their speed and skill The defense consisted of Johnnie Big
Duncan to wit John the son of Big Duncan Campbell on the left hand
and the master on the right backed up by Thomas Finch in goal who much
against his will was in the game that day His heart was heavy within
him for he saw not the gleaming ice and the crowding players but the
room at home and his mother with her pale patient face sitting in
her chair His father he knew would be beside her and Jessac would be
flitting about But for all that shell have a long day he said to
himself for only his loyalty to the school and to Hughie had brought
him to the game that day

When play was called Hughie with Fusie immediately behind him stood
facing Dan in the center with one of the little Red Shirts at his back
It was Dans drop He made a pass or two then shot between his legs
to a Red Shirt who upon receiving passed far out to Red Shirt number
three who flew along the outer edge and returned swiftly to Dan now
far up the other side Like the wind Dan sped down the line dodged
Johnnie Big Duncan easily and shot from the corner straight swift
and true a goal

One for the Front Eleven shinnysticks went up in the air the
bagpipes struck up a wild refrain big Hec Ross and Jimmie Ben danced a
huge unwieldy but altogether jubilant dance round each other and then
settled down to their places for it was Hughies drop

Hughie took the ball from the umpire and faced Dan with some degree of
nervousness for Dan was heavy and strong and full of confidence After
a little manoeuvering he dropped the ball between Dans legs but Dan
instead of attending to the ball charged full upon him and laid him
flat while one of the Red Shirts seizing the ball flew off with
it supported by a friendly Red Shirt on either side of him with Dan
following hard

Right through the crowd dodged the Red Shirts till they came up to the
Twentieth line of defense when forth came Johnnie Big Duncan in swift
attack But the little Red Shirt who had the ball touching it slightly
to the right tangled himself up in Johnnie Big Duncans legs and sent
him sprawling while Dan swiped the ball to another Red Shirt who had
slipped in behind the master for there was no such foolishness as
offside in that game Like lightning the Red Shirt caught the ball and
rushing at Thomas shot furiously at close quarters Goal number two for
the Front

Again on all sides rose frantic cheers The Front The Front Murro
forever Two games had been won and not a Twentieth man had touched
the ball With furtive uncertain glances the men of the Twentieth
team looked one at the other and all at their captain as if seeking
explanation of this extraordinary situation

Well said Hughie in a loud voice to the master and with a careless
laugh though at his heart he was desperate they are giving us a
little taste of our own medicine

The master dropped to buckle his skate deliberately unwinding the
strap while the umpire allowed time

Give me a hand with this Hughie he called and Hughie skated up to
him

Well said Craven smiling up into Hughies face thats a good
swift opening isnt it

Oh its terrible groaned Hughie Theyre going to lick us off the
ice

Well replied the master slowly I wouldnt be in a hurry to say
so We have a hundred minutes and more to win in yet Now dont you see
that their captain is their great card Suppose you let the ball go for
a game or two and stick to Dan Trail him never let him shake you The
rest of us will take care of the game

All right said Hughie Ill stick to him and off he set for the
center

As the loser Hughie again held the drop He faced Dan with
determination to get that ball out to Fusie and somehow he felt in his
bones that he should succeed in doing this Without any preliminary he
dropped and knocked the ball toward Fusie

But this was evidently what Dan expected for as soon as Hughie made the
motion to drop he charged hard upon the waiting Fusie Hughie however
had his plan as well for immediately upon the ball leaving his stick
he threw himself in Dans way checking him effectually and allowing
Fusie with Don and Scotchie following to get away

The Front defense however was too strong and the ball came shooting
back toward the line of Reds one of whom making a short run passed
far out to Dan on the right But before the latter could get up speed
Hughie was upon him and ignoring the ball blocked and bothered and
checked him till one of the Twentieth centers rushing in secured it
for his side

Ha well done captain came Cravens voice across the ice and
Hughie felt his nerve come back If he could hold Dan that deadly Front
combination might be broken

Meantime Don had secured the ball from Craven and was rushing up his
right wing

Here you are Hughie he cried shooting across the Front goal

Hughie sprang to receive but before he could shoot Dan was upon him
checking so hard that Hughie was sent sprawling to the ice while Dan
shot away with the ball

But before he had gone very far Hughie was after him like a whirlwind
making straight for his own goal so that by the time Dan had arrived at
shooting distance Hughie was again upon him and while in the very act
of steadying himself for his try at the goal came crashing into him
with such fierceness of attack that Dan was flung aside while Johnnie
Big Duncan capturing the ball sent it across to the master

It was the masters first chance for the day With amazing swiftness
and dexterity he threaded the outer edge of the ice and with a sudden
swerve across avoided the throng that had gathered to oppose him and
then with a careless ease as if it were a matter of little importance
he dodged in between the heavy Front defense shot his goal and skated
back coolly to his place

The Twentieths moment had come and both upon the ice and upon the
banks the volume and fierceness of the cheering testified to the
intensity of the feeling that had been so long pent up

That game had revealed to Hughie two important facts the first that he
was faster than Dan in a straight race and the second that it would be
advisable to feed the master for it was clearly apparent that there was
not his equal upon the ice in dodging

That was well done captain said Craven to Hughie as he was coolly
skating back to his position

A splendid run sir cried Hughie in return

Oh the run was easy It was your check there that did the trick
Thats the game he continued lowering his voice Its hard on you
though Can you stand it

Well I can try for a while said Hughie confidently

If you can said the master weve got them and Hughie settled down
into the resolve that cost what it might he would stick like a leech
to Dan

He imparted his plan to Fusie adding Now whenever you see me tackle
Dan run in and get the ball Im not going to bother about it

Half an hour had gone The score stood two to one in favor of the Front
but the result every one felt to be still uncertain That last attack of
Hughies and the masters speedy performance gave some concern to the
men of the Front and awakened a feeling of confidence in the Twentieth
team

But Dan wise general that he was saw the danger and gave his commands
ere he faced off for the new game

When that man Craven gets it he said to the men of the center make
straight for the goal Never mind the ball

The wisdom of this order became at once evident for when in the
faceoff he secured the ball Hughie clung so tenaciously to his heels
and checked him so effectually that he was forced to resign it to the
Reds who piercing the Twentieth center managed to scurry up the ice
with the ball between them But when met by Craven and Johnnie Big
Duncan they passed across to Dan Hughie again checked so fiercely that
Johnnie Big Duncan secured the ball passed back to the master who with
another meteoric flash along the edge of the field broke through the
Fronts defense and again shot

It was only Farquhar Bhegs steady coolness that saved the goal It was
a near enough thing however to strike a sudden chill to the heart of
the Front goalkeeper and to make Dan realize that something must be
done to check these dangerous rushes of Craven

Get in behind the defense there and stay there he said to two of his
centers and his tone indicated that his serene confidence in himself
and his team was slightly shaken Hughies close checking was beginning
to chafe him for his team in their practice had learned to depend
unduly upon him

Noticing Dans change in the disposition of his men Hughie moved up two
of his centers nearer to the Front defense

Get into their way he said and give the master a clear field

But this policy only assisted Dans plan of defense for the presence
of so many players before the Front goal filled up the ice to such an
extent that Cravens rushes were impeded by mere numbers

For some time Dan watched the result of his tactics well satisfied
remaining himself for the time in the background During one of the
pauses when the ball was out of play he called one of the little Reds
to him

Look here he said you watch this Right after one of those rushes
of Cravens dont follow him down but keep up to your position Ill
get the ball to you somehow and then youll have a chance to shoot
No use passing to me for this little son of a gun is on my back like a
flea on a dog Dan was seriously annoyed

The little Red passed the word around and patiently waited his chance
Once and again the plan failed chiefly because Dan could not get the
ball out of the scrimmage but at length when Hughie had been tempted
to rush in with the hope of putting in a shot the ball slid out of the
scrimmage and Dan swooping down upon it passed swiftly to the waiting
Red who immediately shot far out to his alert wing and then rushing
down the center and slipping past Johnnie Big Duncan who had gone forth
to meet Dan coming down the right and the master who was attending to
the little Red on the wing received the ball and putting in a short
swift shot scored another goal for the Front amid a tempest of
hurrahings from the team and their supporters

The game now stood three to one in favor of the Front and up to the end
of the first hour no change was made in this score

And now there was a scene of the wildest enthusiasm and confusion The
Front people flocked upon the ice and carried off their team to their
quarter of the shanty loading them with congratulations and refreshing
them with various drinks

Better get your men together captain suggested Craven and Hughie
gathered them into the Twentieth corner of the shanty

In spite of the adverse score Hughie found his team full of fight They
crowded about him and the master eager to listen to any explanation of
the present defeat that might be offered for their comfort or to any
plans by which the defeat might be turned into victory Some
minutes they spent in excitedly discussing the various games and in
goodnaturedly chaffing Thomas Finch for his failure to prevent a score
But Thomas had nothing to say in reply He had done his best and he had
a feeling that they all knew it No man was held in higher esteem by the
team than the goalkeeper

Any plan captain asked the master after they had talked for some
minutes and all grew quiet

What do you think sir said Hughie

O let us hear from you Youre the captain

Well said Hughie slowly and with deliberate emphasis I think we
are going to win Yells from all sides At any rate we ought to
win for I think we have the better team More yells What I mean is
this I think we are better in combination play and I dont think they
have a man who can touch the master

Enthusiastic exclamations Thats right Better believe it Horo

But we have a big fight before us And that Dan Munros a terror The
only change I can think of is to open out more and fall back from their
goal for a little while And then if I can hold Dan

Cries of Youll hold him all right You are the lad

Everybody should feed the master They cant stop him any of them
But I would say for the first while anyway play defense What do you
think sir appealing to the master

I call that good tactics But dont depend too much upon me if any man
has a chance for a run and a shot let him take it And dont give up
your combination in your forward line The captain is quite right in
seeking to draw them away from their goal Their defense territory is
too full now Now what I have noticed is this they mainly rely upon
Dan Munro and upon their three big defense men For the first fifteen
minutes they will make their hardest push Let us take the captains
advice fall back a little and so empty their defense But on the
whole keep your positions play to your men and he added with a
smile dont get too mad

I guess they will be making some plans too said Thomas Finch
slowly and everybody laughed

Thats quite right Thomas but well give them a chance for the first
while to show us what they mean to do

At this point the minister came in looking rather gloomy

Well Mr Craven rather doubtful outlook is it not

O not too bad sir said the master cheerfully

Three to one What worse do you want

Well six to one would be worse replied the master Besides their
first two games were taken by a kind of fluke We didnt know
their play You will notice they have taken only one in the last
threequarters of an hour

I doubt they are too big for you continued the minister

Isnt altogether size that wins in shinny said Mr Craven Hughie
there isnt a very big man but he can hold any one of them

Well I hope you may be right said the minister I am sorry I have
to leave the game to see a sick man up Kenyon way

Sorry you cant stay sir to see us win said Craven cheerfully
while Hughie slipped out to see his mother before she went

Well my boy said his mother you are playing a splendid game and
you are getting better as you go on

Thanks mother Thats the kind of talk we like said Hughie who
had been a little depressed by his fathers rather gloomy views Im
awfully sorry you cant stay

And so am I but we must go But we shall be back in time for supper
and you will ask all the team to come down to celebrate their victory

Good for you mother Ill tell them and I bet theyll play

Meantime the team from the Front had been having something of a
jollification in their quarters They were sure of victory and in spite
of their captains remonstrances had already begun to pass round the
bottle in the way of celebration

Theyre having something strong in there said little Mac McGregor
Wish theyd pass some this way

Let them have it said Johnnie Big Duncan whose whole family ever
since the revival had taken a total abstinence pledge although this
was looked upon as a very extreme position indeed by almost all the
community But Big Duncan Campbell had learned by very bitter experience
that for him at least there was no safety in a moderate use of Gods
good creature as many of his fellow churchmembers designated the
mountain dew and his sons had loyally backed him up in this attitude

Quite right said the master emphatically And if they had any
sense they would know that with every drink they are throwing away a big
chance of winning

Horo you fellows shouted big Hec Ross across to them arent you
going to play any more Have you got enough of it already

We will not be caring for any more of yon kind said Johnnie Big
Duncan goodnaturedly and we were thinking of giving you a change

Come away and be at it then said Hec for were all getting cold

Thats easily cured said Dan as they sallied forth to the ice again
for I warrant you will not be suffering from the cold in five minutes

When the teams took up their positions it was discovered that Dan had
fallen back to the center and Hughie was at a loss to know how to meet
this new disposition of the enemys force

Let them go on said the master with whom Hughie was holding a
hurried consultation You stick to him and well play defense till
they develop their plan

The tactics of the Front became immediately apparent upon the drop of
the ball and proved to be what the master had foretold No sooner had
the game begun than the big defense men advanced with the centers to the
attack and when Hughie followed up his plan of sticking closely to Dan
Munro and hampering him he found Jimmie Ben upon him swiping furiously
with his club at his shins with evident intention of intimidating
him as well as of relieving Dan from his attentions But if Jimmie Ben
thought by his noisy shouting and furious swiping to strike terror to
the heart of the Twentieth captain he entirely misjudged his man for
without seeking to give him back what he received in kind Hughie played
his game with such skill and pluck that although he was considerably
battered about the shins he was nevertheless able to prevent Dan from
making any of his dangerous rushes

Craven meantime if he noticed Hughies hard case was so fully
occupied with the defense of the goal that he could give no thought to
anything else Shot after shot came in upon Thomas at close range
and so savage and reckless was the charge of the Front that their big
defense men Hec Ross and Jimmie Ben abandoning their own positions
were foremost in the melee before the Twentieth goal

For fully fifteen minutes the ball was kept in the Twentieth territory
and only the steady coolness of Craven and Johnnie Big Duncan backed
by Hughies persistent checking of the Front captain and the magnificent
steadiness of Thomas in goal saved the game

At length as the fury of the charge began to expend itself a little
Craven got his chance The ball had been passed out to Dan upon the left
wing of the Front forward line At once Hughie was upon him but Jimmie
Ben following hard with a cruel swipe at Hughies skates laid him
flat but not until he had succeeded in hindering to some degree Dans
escape with the ball Before the Front captain could make use of his
advantage and get clear away the master bore down upon him like a
whirlwind hurled him clear off his feet secured the ball dashed up
the open field and eluding the two centers who had been instructed to
cover the goal easily shot between the balsamtrees

For a few moments the Twentieth men went mad for they all felt that a
crisis had been passed The failure of the Front in what had evidently
been a preconcerted and very general attack was accepted as an omen of
victory

The Front men on the other hand were bitterly chagrined They had come
so near it and yet had failed Jimmie Ben was especially savage He
came down the ice toward the center yelling defiance and threats of
vengeance Come on here Dont waste time Let us at them Well knock
them clear off the ice

It was Dans drop As he was preparing to face off the master skated up
and asked the umpire for time At once the crowd gathered round

Whats the matter Whats up What do you want came on all sides
from the Front team now thoroughly aroused and thirsting for vengeance

Mr Umpire said the master I want to call your attention to a bit
of foul play that must not be allowed to go on and then he described
Jimmie Bens furious attack upon Hughie

It was a deliberate trip as well as a savage swipe at a mans shins
when the ball was not near

At once Jimmie Ben gave him the lie and throwing down his club slammed
his cap upon the ice and proceeded to execute a wardance about it

For a few moments there was a great uproar and then the masters voice
was heard again addressing the umpire

I want to know your ruling upon this Mr Umpire and somehow his
voice commanded a perfect stillness

Well said the umpire hesitating of courseif a man trips it is
foul play butI did not see any tripping And of courseswiping at
a mans shins is not allowed although sometimesit cant very well be
helped in a scrimmage

I merely want to call your attention to it said the master My
understanding of our arrangements Mr Munro he said addressing the
Front captain is that we are here to play shinny You have come up
here I believe to win the game by playing shinny and we are here to
prevent you If you have any other purpose or if any of your men have
any other purpose we would be glad to know it now for we entered this
game with the intention of playing straight clean shinny

Thats right called out Hec Ross thats what were here for And
his answer was echoed on every side except by Jimmie Ben who continued
to bluster and offer fight

O shut your gab finally said Farquhar Bheg impatiently If you
want to fight wait till after the game is done

Heres your cap Jimmie piped a thin little voice Youll take cold
in your head It was little French Fusie holding up Jimmies cap on
the end of his shinny club and smiling with the utmost good nature but
with infinite impudence into Jimmies face

At once there was a general laugh at Jimmie Bens expense who with a
growl seized his cap and putting it on his head skated off to his
place

Now said Hughie calling his men together for a moment let us crowd
them hard and lets give the master every chance we can

No said the master they are waiting for me Suppose you leave Dan
to me for a while You go up and play your forward combination They are
not paying so much attention to you Make the attack from your wing

At the drop Dan secured the ball and followed by Fusie flew up the
center with one of the Reds on either hand Immediately the master
crossed to meet him checked him hard and gave Fusie a chance who
seizing the ball passed far up to Hughie on the right

Immediately the Twentieth forward line rushed and by a beautiful hit
of combined play brought the ball directly before the Front goal when
Don holding it for a moment till Hughie charged in upon Farquhar Bheg
shot and scored

The result of their combination at once inspired the Twentieth team with
fresh confidence and proved most disconcerting to their opponents

Thats the game boys said the master delightedly Keep your heads
and play your positions And so well did the forward line respond that
for the next ten minutes the game was reduced to a series of attacks
upon the Front goal and had it not been for the dashing play of their
captain and the heavy checking of the Front defense the result would
have been most disastrous to them

Meantime the Twentieth supporters lined along either edge became more
and more vociferous as they began to see that their men were getting the
game well into their own hands That steady cool systematic play of
man to man was something quite new to those accustomed to the old style
of game and aroused the greatest enthusiasm

Gradually the Front were forced to fall back into their territory and
to play upon the defensive while the master and Johnnie Big Duncan
moving up toward the center kept their forward line so strongly
supported and checked so effectually any attempts to break through
that thick and fast the shots fell upon the enemys goal

There remained only fifteen minutes to play The hard pace was beginning
to tell upon the big men and the inevitable reaction following their
unwise celebrating began to show itself in their stale and spiritless
play On the other hand the Twentieth were as fresh as ever and
pressed the game with greater spirit every moment

Play out toward the side urged Dan despairing of victory but
determined to avert defeat and at every opportunity the ball was
knocked out of play But like wolves the Twentieth forwards were upon
the ball striving to keep it in play and steadily forcing it toward
the enemys goal

Dan became desperate He was wet with perspiration and his breath was
coming in hard gasps He looked at his team The little Reds were fit
enough but the others were jaded and pumped out Behind him stood
Jimmie Ben savage wet and weary

At one of the pauses when the ball was out of play Dan dropped on his
knee

Hold on there a minute he cried I want to fix this skate of mine

Very deliberately he removed his strap readjusted his skate and began
slowly to set the strap in place again

They want a rest I guess Better take off the time umpire sang out
Fusie dancing as lively as a cricket round Jimmie Ben who looked as if
he would like to devour him bodily

Shut up Fusie said Hughie Weve got all the time we need

You have eh said Jimmie Ben savagely

Yes said Hughie in sudden anger for he had not forgotten Jimmie
Bens cruel swipe We dont need any more time than weve got and we
dont need to play any dirty tricks either Were going to beat you
Weve got you beaten now

Blank your impudent face Wait you Ill show you said Jimmie Ben

You cant scare me Jimmie Ben said Hughie white with rage You
tried your best and you couldnt do it

Play the game Hughie said the master in a low tone skating round
him while Hec Ross said goodnaturedly Shut up Jimmie Ben Youll
need all your wind for your heels at which all but Jimmie Ben laughed

For a moment Dan drew his men together

Our only chance he said is in a rush Now I want every man to make
for that goal Never mind the ball Ill get the ball there And then
you Jimmie Ben and a couple of you centers make right back here on
guard

Theyre going to rush said Hughie to his team Dont all go back
Centers fall back with me You forwards keep up

At the drop Dan secured the ball and in a moment the Front rush came
With a simultaneous yell the whole ten men came roaring down the ice
waving their clubs and flinging aside their lightweight opponents It
was a dangerous moment but with a cry of All steady boys Hughie
threw himself right into Dans way But just for such a chance Jimmie
Ben was watching and rushing upon Hughie caught him fairly with his
shoulder and hurled him to the ice while the attacking line swept over
him

For a single moment Hughie lay dazed but before any one could offer
help he rose slowly and after a few deep breaths set off for the
scrimmage

There was a wild five minutes Eighteen or twenty men were massed in
front of the Twentieth goal striking shoving yelling the solid
weight of the Front defense forcing the ball ever nearer the goal In
the center of the mass were Craven Johnnie Big Duncan and Don fighting
every inch

For a few moments Hughie hovered behind his goal his heart full of
black rage waiting his chance At length he saw an opening Jimmie Ben
slashing heavily regardless of injury to himself or any others had
edged the ball toward the Twentieth left Taking a short run Hughie
reckless of consequences launched himself head first into Jimmie Bens
stomach swiping viciously at the same time at the ball For a moment
Jimmie Ben was flung back and but for Johnnie Big Duncan would have
fallen but before he could regain his feet the ball was set free of
the scrimmage and away Fusie rushing in had snapped it up and had
gone scuttling down the ice followed by Hughie and the master

Before Fusie had got much past center Dan who had been playing in the
rear of the scrimmage overtook him and with a fierce body check upset
the little Frenchman and secured the ball Wheeling he saw both Hughie
and Craven bearing down swiftly upon him

Rush for the goal he shouted to Jimmie Ben who was following Hughie
hard Jimmie Ben hesitated

Back to your defense yelled Dan cutting across and trying to escape
between Hughie and Craven

It was in vain Both of the Twentieth men fell upon him and the master
snatching the ball sped like lightning down the ice

The crowd went wild

Get back Get back there screamed Hughie to the mob crowding in upon
the ice Give us room Give us a show

At this moment Craven cornered by Hec Ross and two of the Red Shirts
with Dan hard upon his heels passed clear across the ice to Hughie
With a swift turn Hughie caught the ball dodged Jimmie Bens fierce
spring at him and shot But even as he shot Jimmie Ben recovering his
balance reached him and struck a hard swinging blow upon his ankle
There was a sharp crack and Hughie fell to the ice The ball went wide

Time there umpire cried the master falling on his knees beside
Hughie Are you hurt Hughie he asked eagerly What is it my boy

Oh master its broken but dont stop Dont let them stop We must
win this game Weve only a few minutes Take me back to goal and send
Thomas out

The eager hurried whisper the intense appeal in the white face and
dark eyes made the master hesitate in his emphatic refusal

You cant

Oh dont stop Dont stop it for me cried Hughie gripping the
masters arm Help me up and take me back

The master swore a fierce oath

Well do it my boy Youre a trump Here Don he called aloud
well let Hughie keep goal for a little and they ran Hughie back to
the goal on one skate

You go out Thomas gasped Hughie Dont talk Weve only five
minutes

They have broken his leg said the master with a sob in his voice

Nothing wrong I hope said Dan skating up

No play the game said the master fiercely His black eyes were
burning with a deep red glow

Is it hurting much asked Thomas lingering about Hughie

Oh you just bet But dont wait Go on Go on down Youve got to get
this game

Thomas glanced at the foot hanging limp and then at the white but
resolute face Then saying with slow savage emphasis The brute beast
As sure as death Ill do for him he skated off to join the forward
line

It was the Front knockoff from goal There was no plan of attack but
the Twentieth team looking upon the faces of the master and Thomas
needed no words of command

The final round was shot short sharp fierce A long drive from
Farquhar Bheg sent the ball far up into the Twentieth territory It was
a bad play for it gave Craven and Thomas their chance

Follow me close Thomas cried the master meeting the ball and
setting off like a whirlwind

Past the little Reds through the centers and into the defense line
he flashed followed hard by Thomas In vain Hec Ross tried to check
Craven was past him like the wind There remained only Dan and Jimmie
Ben A few swift strides and the master was almost within reach of
Dans club With a touch of the ball to Thomas he charged into his
waiting foe flung him aside as he might a child and swept on

Take the man Thomas he cried and Thomas gathering himself up in
two short quick strikes dashed hard upon Jimmie Ben and hurled him
crashing to the ice

Take that you brute you he said and followed after Craven

Only Farquhar Bheg was left

Take no chances cried Craven again Come on and both of them
sweeping in upon the goalkeeper lifted him clear through the goal and
carried the ball with them

Time called the umpire The great game was won

Then before the crowd had realized what had happened and before they
could pour in upon the ice Craven skated back toward Jimmie Ben

The game is over he said in a low fierce tone You cowardly
blackguard you werent afraid to hit a boy now stand up to a man if
you dare

Jimmie Ben was no coward Dropping his club he came eagerly forward but
no sooner had he got well ready than Craven struck him fair in the face
and before he could fall caught him with a straight swift blow on the
chin and lifting him clear off his skates landed him back on his head
and shoulders on the ice where he lay with his toes quivering

Serve him right said Hec Ross

There was no more of it The Twentieth crowds went wild with joy and
rage for their great game was won and the news of what had befallen
their captain had got round

He took his city though Mrs Murray said the master after the
great supper in the manse that evening as Hughie lay upon the sofa
pale suffering but happy And not only one but a whole continent of
them and he added the game as well

With sudden tears and a little break in her voice the mother said
looking at her boy It was worth while taking the city but I fear the
game cost too much

Oh pshaw mother said Hughie its only one bone and I tell you
that final round was worth a leg



CHAPTER XV

THE RESULT


How many did you say Craven of those Glengarry men of yours
Professor Gray was catechizing his nephew

Ten of them sir besides the ministers son who is going to take the
full university course

And all of them bound for the ministry

So they say And judging by the way they take life and the way for
instance they play shinny I have a notion they will see it through

They come of a race that sees things through answered the professor
And this is the result of this Zion Hill Academy I have been hearing so
much about

Well sir they put in a good years work I must say

You might have done worse sir Indeed you deserve great credit sir

I Not a bit I simply showed them what to do and how to do it But
theres a woman up there that the world ought to know about For love of
her

Oh the world snorted the professor The world sir The Lord
deliver us It might do the world some good I grant

It is for love of her these men are in for the ministry

You are wrong sir That is not their motive

No perhaps it is not It would be unfair to say so but yet she

I know sir I know sir Bless my soul sir I know her I knew her
before you were born Butyes yes the professor spoke as if to
himselffor love of her men would attempt great things You have
these names Craven Ah Alexander Stewart Donald Cameron Thomas
FinchFinch let me seeah yes Finch His mother died after a long
illness Yes I remember A very sad case a very sad case indeed

And yet not so sad sir put in Craven At any rate it did not
seem so at the time That night it seemed anything but sad It was
wonderful

The professor laid down his list and sat back in his chair

Go on sir he said gazing curiously at Craven I have heard a
little about it Let me see it was the night of the great match was it
not

Did you know about that Who told you about the match sir

I hear a great many things and in curious ways But go on sir go
on

Craven sat silent and from the look in his eyes his thoughts were far
away

Well sir its a thing I have never spoken about It seems to me if I
may say so something quite too sacred to speak of lightly

Again Craven paused while the professor waited

It was Hughie sent me there There was a jubilation supper at
the manse you understand Thomas Finch the goalkeeper you
knowmagnificent fellow toowas not at the supper A messenger had
come for him saying that his mother had taken a bad turn Hughie was
much disappointed and they were all evidently anxious I offered to
drive over and inquire and of course the ministers wife though she
had been on the go all day long must needs go with me I can never
forget that night I suppose you have noticed sir there are times
when one is more sensitive to impressions from ones surroundings than
others There are times with me too when I seem to have a very vital
kinship with nature At any rate during that drive nature seemed to get
close to me The dark still forest the crisp air the frost sparkling
in the starlight on the treesit all seemed to be part of me I fear I
am not explaining myself

Craven paused again and his eyes began to glow The professor still
waited

When we reached the house we found them waiting for death The
ministers wife went in I waited in the kitchen By and by Billy Jack
thats her eldest son you know came out She is asking for you he
said and I went in I had often seen her before and I rather think
she liked me You see I had been able to help Thomas along pretty well
both in school and with his night work and she was grateful for what I
had done absurdly grateful when one considers how little it was I had
seen death before and it had always been ghastly but there was nothing
ghastly in death that night The whole scene is before me now I suppose
always will be

His dead black eyes were beginning to show their deep red fire

The professor looked at him for a moment or two and then said
Proceed if you please and Craven drew a long breath as if recalling
himself and went on

The old man was there at one side with his gray head down on the
bed his little girl kneeling beside him with her arm round his neck
opposite him the ministers wife her face calm and steady Billy Jack
standing at the foot of the bedhe and little Jessac the only ones in
the room who were weepingand there at the head Thomas supporting
his mother now and then moistening her lips and giving her sips of
stimulant and so quick and steady gentle as a woman and smiling
through it all I could hardly believe it was the same big fellow who
three hours before had carried the ball through the Front defense I
tell you sir it was wonderful

There was no fuss or hysterical nonsense in that room The mother lay
there quite peaceful pain all goneand she had had enough of it in
her day She was quite a beautiful woman too in a way Fine eyes
remarkable eyes splendidly firm mouth showing great nerve I should
say All her life I understand she lived for others and even now her
thought was not of herself When I came in she opened her eyes They
were like stars actually shining and her smile was like the sudden
breaking of light through a cloud She put out her hand for mine and
saidand I value these words sirMr Craven I give you a mithers
thanks and a mithers blessing for a you have done for ma laddie She
was Lowland Scotch you know My voice went all to pieces I tried to
say it was nothing but stuck Thomas helped me out and without a shake
or quiver in his voice he answered for me

Yes indeed mother well not forget it

And perhaps you can help him a bit still He will be needing it she
added

I assure you sir that quiet steadiness of Thomas and herself braced
me up and I was able to make my promise And then she said with a look
that somehow reminded me of the deep starlit night outside through
which I had just come And you Mr Craven you will give your life to
God

Again my voice failed me It was so unexpected and quite overwhelming
Once more Thomas answered for me

Yes mother he will sure and she seemed to take it as my promise
for she smiled again at me and closed her eyes

I had read of triumphant deathbed scenes and all that before without
taking much stock in them but believe me sir that room was full of
glory The very faces of those people it seemed to me were alight It
may be imagination but even now as I think of it it seems real There
were no farewells no wailing and at the very last not even tears
Thomas who had nursed her for more than a year still supported her
the smile on his face to the end And the endCravens voice grew
unsteadyit is difficult to speak of The ministers wife repeated the
words about the house with many mansions and those about the valley
of the shadow and said a little prayer and then we all waited for the
endfor myself I confess with considerable fear and anxiety I had
no need to fear After a long silence she sat up straight and in her
Scotch tongue she said with a kind of amazed joy in her tone Ma
fayther Ma fayther I am here Then she settled herself back in her
sons arms drew a deep breath and was still All through the night
and next day the glory lingered round me I went about as in a strange
world I am afraid you will be thinking me foolish sir

The stern old professor was openly wiping his eyes He seemed quite
unable to find his voice At length he took up the list again and began
to read it mechanically

What Whats this he said suddenly pointing to a name on the list

That sir is John Craven

Do you mean that you too

Yes I mean it if you think I am fit

Fit Jack my boy None of us are fit But whathow did this come
The professor blew his nose like a trumpet

That I can hardly tell myself said Craven with a kind of wonder
in his voice but at any rate it is the result of my Glengarry School
Days
